The father of former Premier League and England football stars Gary and Phil Neville will face a jury trial for sexual assault.

Neville Neville, 63, appeared at Bolton Crown Court today where a date was set for his trial facing a single charge of a serious sexual assault.

Neville, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and striped tie, spoke only to confirm his name and sat in the dock of the court for most of the 10-minute hearing as legal arrangements were discussed for the forthcoming trial, which will last up to four days starting on December 16.

Neville, of Bury, left court without comment.

Neville works as an agent for his sons, former Everton captain Phil and former Manchester United captain Gary - now an England coach and TV pundit.

He is also a former director of League One side Bury FC.

He was also a sportsman in his own right, and played for Greenmount in the Bolton Cricket League in the 1980s.

Neville has earned cult status amongst football fans, who have delighted in making up chants about his unusual name.

He also became popular after celebrating with the partners of the England players in Germany at the 2006 World Cup.

He is believed to have stood on a chair in a local restaurant and led them all in a rendition of the national anthem before ordering them to smash their champagne glasses.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
