Sunderland midfielder Charis Mavrias has joined Panathinaikos on loan for the remainder of the season.

The 20-year-old, who arrived on Wearside from the Greek club in August 2013, returns after making just six senior appearances.

Greece international Mavrias scored his only goal for the club on January 25 last year.

That proved to be the winner in a 1-0 FA Cup fourth-round victory over Kidderminster Harriers.

Mavrias made 54 league appearances during his first spell in the Greek Superleague, scoring three times.

He has also been capped by his country on three occasions.
