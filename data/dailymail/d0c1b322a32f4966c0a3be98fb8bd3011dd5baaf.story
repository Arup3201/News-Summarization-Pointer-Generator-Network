A pillow-wielding mob descended on Trafalgar Square today for feathery fisticuffs in front of London's most iconic monuments.

Trafalgar Square's usual inhabitants - tourists and pigeons - beat a hasty retreat as a flashmob of thousands gathered for a good old-fashioned pillow fight in the sunshine.

Similar scenes were repeated all over the world as part of annual World Pillow Fight Day.

For the fifth year in a row, Trafalgar Square was invaded for an hour of relaxation in the sunshine as Londoners let their inhibitions go and attacked strangers with gusto.

Equally enthusiastic scenes were replicated in major U.S. cities including Atlanta, Boston and Chicago and as far afield as Hong Kong.

There were just two rules.

Revellers were not allowed to hit anyone with a camera, or anyone not armed with a pillow.
