 Google is set to bring its $35 Chromecast dongle to hifi systems.

The firm today revealed a major new push into audio designed to take on Apple TV.

It plans to partner with hifi firms to create speakers for the service, and today revealed it will already work with speakers connected to a TV.

The update allows users to control music on their compatible speakers from a mobile phone

Google Audio cast works with the following apps:

Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, TuneIn, and many others.

However, key services, including Spotify, are currently missing. 

Currently the system allows people to play back video from sites such as Netflix. 

However, Google is now bringing the same technology behind its popular $35 Chromecast dongle into speakers, soundbars and A/V receivers. 

It says users will be able to 'cast' audio wirelessly from a variety of apps on your Android or iOS smartphone, or the Web, in a similar fashion to the way people with a Chromecast stream video.

'Just like Chromecast, simply tap the cast button in your favorite music or radio app on Android, iOS, or the web, and select a Google Cast Ready speaker to get the party started.'

Similar to the video service, users can use their phone to control the music, which is then played directly through the speaker from cloud services, meaning they can use their phone for other things. 

'Google Cast Ready speakers pull content directly from the cloud, so you’ll get the best audio quality and can freely multi-task on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all without straining the battery,' it says.

The service is available from today, and Google's speakers will work with a growing list of apps including Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, TuneIn, and doznes more.

The $35 gadget, which resembles a USB stick, is plugged directly into the HDMI port on modern TVs and streams content from the web, via peoples phones, tablets and laptops.

All this content is controlled via apps, and the European version of the stick currently features content from the BBC, YouTube and Netflix, while the US version has a host of apps.

Chromecast is a direct competitor to the Apple TV system that was launched by the Cupertino company in 2007, and is now in its third generation. It also rivals the streaming box services of Roku.

By comparison, Roku boxes start at £60 ($99), while the Apple TV device sells for £99 in the UK and $99 in the U.S.

Chromecast is compatible with Android smartphones and tablets, as well as Chrome and Apple's iOS operating system. 

However, some major streaming services, including Spotify, are currently missing from the list. 

Google intends to broaden the Google Cast ecosystem over the coming months by bringing it into more televisions, game consoles, and set-top boxes with Android TV. 

The company is also working to enable other non-audio apps to enhance the experience by supporting Google Cast Ready audio devices. 

For example, you might be able to see a video on a tablet, but hear the audio on a set of bedroom speakers.
