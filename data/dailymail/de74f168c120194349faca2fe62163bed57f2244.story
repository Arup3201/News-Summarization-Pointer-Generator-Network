The grieving father of one of the six students murdered by the 'virgin killer' in California on Friday, led a rousing call for a change in gun laws at a memorial today.

As Richard Martinez addressed a crowd of about 20,000 who gathered for the University of California Santa Barbara memorial, the crowd got to their feet and joined his chant of 'Not One More'.

Moments earlier he had given an emotional tribute to his only son, Christopher, who just before his death had been planning a year in London before starting law school.

Change: Richard Martinez, who son Christopher was shot dead in Friday's attack, calls for tougher gun laws

Moved: The university football stadium was filled as the campus gathered to remember those who had died

Support: A group of friends comfort each other at the day of reflection, held on Tuesday afternoon

Instead, the 20-year-old became the sixth victim to die on Friday, during a deadly rampage by a college student in Isla Vista.

Mr Martinez used the memorial on Tuesday to call for an end to gun violence, telling the crowd: 'Too many people have died, and there 
should be not one more,' NBC Los Angeles reported.

'How many more people are going to have to die in
 this situation before the problem gets solved?' he asked.

'They [politicians] have done nothing and that's why Chris died ... in my opinion,' Mr Martinez said.

'It's almost become a normal thing for us to accept [mass shootings] ... It's not normal. Life doesn't have to be like this.' 

Action: Martinez holds his hand in the air as he calls on students to join his call of 'Not one more'

Respect: The crowd of about 20,000 who had gathered at a stadium on the Santa Barbara campus, gave Martinez a standing ovation and took up his call

United in grief: Thousands of students gathered at the university's stadium to remember the six victims

After talking of his son's love of 
basketball, and describing him as kind and competitive, Mr Martinez 
addressed lawmakers who had reached out to him after Christopher's 
death.

In his speech at the Day of Reflection, Richard Martinez called for an end to gun violence:

'How many more people are going to have to die in
 this situation before the problem gets solved?'

'They [politicians] have done nothing and that's why Chris died ... in my opinion.'

'It's almost become a normal thing for us to accept this. It's not normal ... life doesn't have to be like this.'

'Too many people have died, and there 
should be not one more.'

'Don't tell me you are sorry about my son's death until you do something,' he said, according to Anderson Cooper 360.

Mr Martinez told the crowd he should not be seen as a spokesman for all the families caught up in the stabbings and shootings.

But he was asked by the families of Cheng Yuan Hong and Weihan 'David' Wang, to give statements on their behalf.

As he held a Gone With The Wind book bag aloft, Mr Martinez read a statement from the Hong family, which said: 'May we together create a peaceful world and let hatred be gone with the wind.'

The family of 20-year-old Wang have also called for tighter gun control.

In their statement read by Mr Martinez, they said: 'Our child desired a land free from fear.'

Memorial: Crowds applaud after one of the speeches given in tribute to the victims

Response: The crowd get to their feet and yell 'Not One More' in response to Richard Martinez's speech

When Mr Martinez ended his speech, he called on the students gathered there to join him in his demand to end gun violence.

As he returned to his seat, the grieving father was given a standing ovation, and the crowd continued the chant 'Not one more', which he had led them in just moments before.

Mr Martinez had began his campaign just one day after his son's death, making an emotional televised appearance on Saturday.

Clutching a photo of his son, he said: 'Why did Chris die? Chris died because 
of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.

'They talk about gun 
rights, but what about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity 
stop?'

Promising: Christopher Martinez had planned to study in London for a year before starting law school

Victim: Christopher, 20, was one of six students to be killed in Friday's attack

Emotional: One day after his son was shot dead, Richard Martinez, center, blamed Christopher's death on 'irresponsible politicians and the NRA'

The attack on Friday afternoon, which killed six and injured nine, has rocked the Isla Vista community.

The victims were named as Veronika Weiss, 19, Katie Cooper, 22, Chris Martinez, 20, Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, George Chen, 19, and Weihan Wang, 20.

On Tuesday, the Santa Barbara campus closed class and instead held a Day of Mourning and Reflection for its lost students at the football stadium.

As she opened the memorial, University of California president, and former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, said: 'Frankly, I wish I were not here today. None us wants to be here for an occasion like this.'

She said of the young victims: 'These were individuals who each left a mark on the world around them.'

Composed: Richard Martinez also read statements from relatives of other victims, including the Hong family who called for 'Hatred to be gone with the wind'

Show of support: Charlie Wang and Jinshuang Liu, whose son Weihan 'David' Wang was killed, greet the crowd at the memorial

Reflection: Thousands gathered on the Santa Barbara campus on Tuesday to pay tribute to the young victims

Heart-breaking: Students hold back their tears as they attend a memorial for the victims in Friday's attack

Tragic: The loss of six promising students weighed heavily on the campus community

Demands for a change in gun laws were echoed by the family of another victim, 19-year-old Veronika Weiss.

At
 a memorial for the first-year student on Monday, her father, Bob, had 
said: 'The kids keep dying ... Guns showing up everywhere.'

The
 22-year-old gunman who killed Veronika, and five others before taking 
his own life, had legally bought three handguns in the months leading up
 the attack.

Also on Tuesday, two California Assembly members proposed legislation that would create a gun violence restraining order that could be sought from a judge by law enforcement at the request of family members and friends.

Tributes: A woman listens to speakers at the university Day of Reflection

Mourning: Many in the crowd could be seen wiping away tears as the lives of those lost were celebrated

Comfort: Friends hug as they attend the public memorial at the university

Gathering: The stadium was packed as thousands gathered to pay their respects

'When someone is in crisis, the people closest to them are often the first to spot the warning signs but almost nothing can now be done to get back their guns or prevent them from buying more,' Nancy Skinnery, who sponsored the measure with Das Williams, said.

Senate President Darrell Steinberg has suggested that authorities carrying out welfare visits should check whether a person has purchased weapons instead of just talking to them.

'There is a lot we can do to prevent these kinds of horrific events in the future,' Mr Steinberg said.
