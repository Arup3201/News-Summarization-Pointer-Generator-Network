A teenage fly-tipper was caught after he dumped false teeth along with scrap metal - and a householder recognised them.

Blue Grimster, 19, charged locals in Fleetwood, Lancashire, £70 to take away their discarded metal and rubbish.

But instead of disposing of the waste at a council tip, he dumped it in an alleyway in Blackpool.

Illegal: Grimster charged householders £70 to take away their scrap metal and rubbish. But instead of getting rid of the waste properly, he dumped it in the alleyway. Above, the rubbish pile in which the dentures were found

He was found out after Blackpool Council set up a covert camera in the street following a series of complaints from residents.

Footage captured an unidentified young man taking a black bin bag from the back of a flat bed truck and leaving it in the alleyway, Blackpool Magistrates' Court heard.

Council officials traced the bag to an address on Chatsworth Avenue in Fleetwood, where they asked the householders to identify the contents.

Bizarrely, the first item they came across was the set of dentures - leading one of the householders to say: 'Yes, I recognise them... they are mum's old ones and were thrown away when we were having a clear out at her house.'

The court heard how locals had paid Grimster - who had called himself simply 'Blue' - up to £70 to take away their scrap metal and rubbish.

It would have cost him £30 to dump the waste at an official council tip, but instead he chose to fly-tip and keep the cash.

Lee Petrak, prosecuting, said : 'Council officers investigating the fly tipping traced it back to a house at Fleetwood and some of a bag's contents were positively identified by a family member.'

Meanwhile, Gerry Coyle, defending, said: 'My client has no defence. He has given up the scrap metal business now.

'He is the black sheep of a good family .His mother is a school teacher. He was caught after the false teeth were recognised.' 

Grimster has been sentenced to 60 hours of unpaid community
work after admitting an offence under the 
Environmental Protection Act.
