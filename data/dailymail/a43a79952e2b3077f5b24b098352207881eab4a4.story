QPR have had an opening Â£5m bid for Leroy Fer rejected by Norwich City.

The 24-year-old Holland international is keen on a return to the Premier League and QPR will make an improved offer.

Harry Redknapp's side have already been busy in the transfer market this summer.

They have completed the signings of defensive duo Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker and now Redknapp has turned to bolstering his midfield options.

After suffering the disappointment of relegation from the Premier League last season, Fer was part of the Holland side that finished third at the 2014 World Cup.
