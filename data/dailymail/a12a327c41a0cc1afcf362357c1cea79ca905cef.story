Even his famously gruff ­detective may not have put it quite so bluntly.

Colin Dexter, the creator of Inspector Morse, has delivered what appears to be the death-knell for the show’s popular spin-off, Lewis, saying it will end soon as the character cannot go on ‘much longer’.

He also criticised the first two series of the Oxford-based detective drama, which stars Kevin Whately, saying they were ‘ridiculously complex’.

Death knell: Colin Dexter says the next series of Morse spin-off Lewis is likely to be the last as the show has become too complicated and has run its course

The 81-year-old novelist works on Lewis as a consultant ‘on all aspects of the production’. Around half a dozen different screenwriters have written episodes over the years.

The drama was first broadcast on ITV1 in 2006. It follows on from the much-loved Inspector Morse series,  with Morse’s former sidekick, Robbie Lewis, becoming the main character.

Dexter made his comments ahead of the sixth series of the successful drama, which will be broadcast later this month.

He told Radio Times: ‘I don’t think he [Lewis] can go on much longer. They’ll probably do one more series. The first two were ridiculously complex.’ But he did concede: ‘They’ve got better.’

Classic drama: Morse was one of the most popular TV series in British history

Dexter’s first Morse novel was published in 1975, and in 1987 ITV began adapting the books for the hit drama, starring the late John Thaw as Chief Inspector Morse with Whately as the then Sergeant Lewis. It ended in 2000 after 33 episodes.

Its successor, Lewis, has become one of ITV1’s most consistent ­performers in recent years, often ­pulling in audiences of more than seven million. It also stars Laurence Fox as Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, Lewis’s sidekick.

Earlier this year the Morse brand was extended further with a one-off prequel, Endeavour, which was a ratings success.

Dexter said: ‘One reason Endeavour did well is because everyone could understand it. People said to me, “Brilliant. Typical Dexter”. Well, I didn’t write it. I wish I had. The agreement is they won’t put anything on telly without me seeing it. Sometimes we have to say it’s not up to scratch.’

Dexter, who gave up alcohol because of ‘over-consumption’, said he is often asked why he killed off Morse.

He explained that the character’s death would have been inevitable because of his unhealthy lifestyle and famous fondness for whisky.

The novelist added: ‘I was asked if I thought of an epitaph for him [Morse], and remembered “Under this sod lies another”.’

He told how everyone praised him, telling him what a ‘clever chap’ he was, when really he had taken the quote from Spike Milligan.

Whately has also recently hinted that the drama might not last much longer. ‘I’m now police retirement age this year, so the time is coming quite soon, I think,’ he said.

Around 13million viewers tuned in to watch the last episode of Morse in 2000, and there was a huge outpouring of sadness for the detective’s demise.

But Lewis fans can take some solace. Following its success earlier in the year, a full series of Endeavour, starring Shaun Evans as the young Morse, has now been commissioned.

Evans won over critics and viewers alike with his portrayal of the young detective.

Ratings for the one-off film, which was broadcast in January to mark the 25th anniversary of the very first episode of Morse, were 8.2million.
