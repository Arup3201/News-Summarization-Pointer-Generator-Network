Shedding excess pounds is not only good for your health, but losing weight can help people get a better night's sleep and feel more alert, new research has found.

Obese adults who lose at least 5 per cent of their body weight slept better and longer after six months of weight loss, the study revealed.

The findings, published at a joint meeting of the International Society of Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society in Chicago, found weight loss improved sleep quality and mood regardless of how those taking part lost the weight.

A new study carried out by experts in the U.S. has found that people who lose five per cent of their body weight enjoy a better night's sleep and are more likely to be in a good mood

Lead researcher Nasreen Alfaris from the University of Pennsylvannia in Philidelphia said: 'This study confirms several studies reporting that weight loss is associated with increased sleep duration.'

The study examined 390 obese men and women over the course of two years.

Those taking part were randomly assigned to one of three weight loss programmes.

One group received printed educational material during visits four times a year, another group were given brief lifestyle counseling while the final group were given the counseling in addition to meal replacements or weight loss medication.

Researchers then looked at the changes in weight, sleep duration and quality, and a participant's mood after six and 24 months of treatment.

They compared those who lost 5 per cent more of their original body weight with those who lost less than 5 per cent, taking into account age and sex.

At six months those people in both 
groups receiving lifestyle counseling lost more weight on average than 
those who were just given the relevant information.

Across
 all three groups, those participants who lost at least 5 per cent of 
their body weight at the six-month mark reported they gained an average 
of 21.6 minutes of sleep a night, compared with 1.2 minutes for those 
who lost less than 5 per cent body weight.

Those who lost more weight also reported better sleep quality and mood.

Dr
 Alfaris added: 'Further studies are needed to examine the potential 
effects of weight regain in diminishing the short-term improvements of 
weight loss on sleep duration and sleep quality.'
