Photographs of a father who handcuffed his daughter to his wrist because he was terrified she might be kidnapped have illustrated the shocking growth of child abductions in China.

The images were taken at Beijing South railway station and showed father Chen Yen and his daughter waiting for a train with a whole host of security devices intended to keep her safe.

An estimated 70,000 children are kidnapped in China every year as the country's tough one child policy has led to very few children being put up for adoption, in turn fueling a chilling black market in kidnapped children for couples unable to have their own.

Keeping her safe: Chen Yen said that he and his daughter were travelling to celebrate the country's Spring Festival with her grandparents when a photographer took images of the pair handcuffed together

Mr Chen said that he and his daughter were travelling to celebrate the country's Spring Festival with her grandparents when a photographer took images of the pair handcuffed together.

Before the trip Mr Chen heard about the daughter of one of his neighbours being snatched outside her school and vowed to do everything he could to avoid the same thing happening to her.

One the day of the journey he had also seen a television broadcast warning travellers that pickpockets and thieves would be out in force during the festival, and to remain vigilant.

Speaking of his decision, Mr Chen said: 'I have a neighbour in Beijing who went to collect his child from school and she had been snatched. 

'I don't intend to wait until it's too late and I'm taking no chances with my daughter,' he added.

'I saw a warning by police on the TV to take care as traffickers and pick pockets would be out stealing in the holiday rush,' Mr Chen said.

'I don't care about pickpockets but I do care very much about losing my daughter,' he went on.

Safety: Mr Chen said the handcuffs are not the only security measure he and his daughter use when travelling in public. 'She also has a [yellow] watch that lets me find her at any time, and her [silver] necklace has my telephone number on it,' he said

Despite a recent crackdown on the illegal black market in kidnapped children, an estimated 70,000 children still go missing every year. The majority of them thought to have been taken by criminal gangs who then sell them to couples unable to have children for various reasons.

China's one child policy is fueling the trade as it has led to far fewer children available for adoption.

Mr Chen said the handcuffs are not the only security measure he and his daughter use when travelling in public, although he admits he does not feel totally safe unless she is tied to him.

'She also has a watch that lets me find her at any time, and her necklace has my telephone number on it,' he said.

'It is the very least a parent should do, I can't believe that people let their children play on the streets and then complain when they are abducted,' he added.
