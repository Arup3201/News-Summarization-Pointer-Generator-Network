Ministry of Justice officials have been forced to remove 'terribly wrong' guidance for disabled people which suggested that suspects had to prove their innocence when accused of a crime.

A leading QC condemned the error saying it went against a 'fundamental' cornerstone of British law which placed the burden of proof on the prosecution.

The simplified guide, which was aimed at those with learning difficulties and a limited grasp of English, used illustrations and text to help people understand the court process.

It said: 'If you say you did not do a crime, you may have to go back to the Court on a different day, to show the Court you did not do the crime. This is called a trial.'

Mukul Chawla QC, who highlighted the error on Twitter, said: 'What on Earth? Has the Ministry of Justice changed the law on the burden of proof anyone noticing?'

He told The Independent: 'They've got it so terribly wrong here... It's the most fundamental thing that the burden of proof will always be on the prosecution and if you're producing an easy-read guide to these proceedings, the last thing you want to do is misrepresent something as basic as that.

'While I'm delighted that anyone wants to produce easy reads to difficult subjects including going to court, the basic principle has to be that they get the law right.'

The presumption of innocence is a right with origins that can be traced back to the Magna Carta, which has its 800th anniversary this year.

Experts said the MoJ document must have been produced by people with no legal experience and then published before it was checked.

Legal blogger Jack of Kent said: 'What makes this particularly worrying is that it is in an official document – supposed to be authoritative and reliable – aimed at people with learning difficulties facing trials for serious crimes (the Crown Court is for serious crimes and its trials are with juries, the magistrates' courts do not have juries and are for less serious crimes). 

'What has probably happened is that the copywriter had no legal qualifications or experience.

And the Easy Read was then published without anyone with legal qualifications or experience at the MoJ bothering to check that the Easy Read was accurate – that is, before publishing it for people with learning difficulties to rely on when they are accused of serious crimes.

'The MoJ is not in a good state internally; but telling people with learning difficulties that they are guilty if accused of serious crimes unless they can prove they are innocent is surely a low-point.'

A MoJ spokesman said: 'Easy read guides are an important way of providing information to people in simple and straightforward language. It is crucial to ensure these documents are precise and as helpful as possible. 

'We are reviewing this guide and will remove it from our website while this process takes place.'
