The identities of three of the good Samaritans who saved a driver's life by pulling him out of his blazing car after it crashed and burst into flames in Virginia have been revealed. 

Two of the men, James Shea and Tyrone Carmen, were driving along the Powhite Parkway in Chesterfield County shortly before 3am on Sunday when they spotted the fire and pulled over.

After realizing it was a burning car lying on its side, they desperately tried to kick in the vehicle's sunroof to rescue the stricken male driver, but it failed to give way.

However, seconds later, the third man, Aaron Parks, from Chesterfield, arrived at the scene carrying a hammer, broke the glass and dragged the victim out of the car.

Another helper: Tyrone Carmen was also driving along the Powhite Parkway in Chesterfield County shortly before 3am when he spotted the fire and pulled over. He helped Mr Shea and Mr Parks to save the driver

Footage of the blaze: After realising the fire was, in fact, a burning car lying on its side, Mr Parks and Mr Carmen - along with several others - desperately tried to kick in the vehicle's sunroof to rescue the man

Footage, captured on eyewitness Devon Farmer's cellphone, shows Mr Parks and several others pulling the injured driver across the highway to safety as the car blazes just meters away.

And it was a good job they did - because moments later, a large part of the vehicle exploded, according to WTVR. 

Once he was a safe distance away from the car, the man - who was traveling alone - was tended to by EMT Ryan Scarbrough, while being comforted by his rescuers and other passersby.

Firefighters, police and firefighters arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to VCU Medical Center, with 'non-life-threatening' injuries, where he is believed to remain in a stable condition.

The video footage was later uploaded to Facebook, prompting Mr Parks and Mr Carmen to share their experiences of the terrifying incident.

Mr Parks wrote: 'I was lucky enough to have the hammer. But my friend and another passerby were crucial in helping to get him out.

Injured: The man's trousers were seemingly burned off in the ferocious blaze in the early hours of Sunday

'The flames were intense. He didn't have 15 more seconds to spare. I hope he is ok.'

Meanwhile, Mr Carmen said: 'The guy with the hammer saved the day. My ankles are a little sore from kicking the windshield but I walked away with a whole other perspective on life.' 

Today, hundreds of Facebook users also took to the social-networking site to congratulate the good Samaritans - some of whom remain unnamed - on their 'heroic' efforts to save the driver.

Gretchen Hansen Webb wrote: 'Everyone that participated in this rescue should be so proud!! There are to many people that won't put themselves out there like that!'

And Charlie Hairfield said: 'Way to go! Nice to see there are are still selfless people around.'

The crash is believed to have occurred after the car hit a guard rail and flipped over, landing wheels-up on Powhite Parkway. Police are investigating.
