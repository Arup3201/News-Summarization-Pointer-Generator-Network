When most people think of taxidermy they get images of the macabre severed heads of moose and deer leering from the dining room walls of gun enthusiasts.

But many of the most striking displays at our favourite museums have only been made possible thanks to the art, which dates back hundreds of years.

Here, in the taxidermy lab at the Museum of Natural History in Toulouse, taxidermist Brian Aeillo prepares a bear called Cannelle to be shown to the public.

Not a 'stuffed' animal: Taxidermist Brian Aeillo works in his laboratory at the Museum of Natural History in Toulouse. She will be the star of a new exhibition set to open there in October

But it is dead: The exhibition - called Bears, Myths and Realities - will present the ten bear species that exist on out planet, but will also go deeper to look at the relationship between man and bears

Macabre: But many of the most striking displays at our favourite museums have only been made possible thanks to the art of taxidermy, which dates back hundreds of years

Careful work: These days, however, professional taxidermists prefer the term 'mounting' to 'stuffing', reflecting the effort that goes into the carefully sculpted bodies beneath the skin

Ambiguity: Francis Duranthon, chief curator of the museum, said: 'Since ancient times man has carried an ambiguous relationship with the bear, a mythical animal which is both a scary predator and a companion of children

The museum already houses a collection of more than 2.5million items, but Canelle will be the star of a large exhibition on bears set to open there this autumn.

Francis Duranthon, chief curator of the Museum of Natural History, told La Depeche: 'We are currently finalising the naturalisation of Canelle in our taxidermy laboratory and she will undoubtedly be one of the stars of the show.'

The exhibition - called Bears, Myths and Realities - will present the ten bear species that exist on out planet, but will also go deeper to look at the relationship between humans and bears.

'Since ancient times man has carried an ambiguous relationship with the bear, a mythical animal which is both a scary predator and a companion of children,' Mr Duranthon said.

'We will discuss many legends and extraordinary stories like Woyzeck the Bear, mascot of the Polish Army, which fought in the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 and was even decorated!'

Would make a nice rug: To prepare the bears - and any other animal - for display they must first be skinned, which can be done in a manner similar to the way you might skin a chicken before cooking it

Preservation: Depending on the type of skin, chemicals are added to preserve it or it may be tanned like leather, before it is mounted on a mannequin made from wood, wool and wire, or polyurethane

While the preservation of animal skins has been practised almost since the beginning of recorded civilisation, the earliest modern-style taxidermy techniques were published in the middle of the 18th century

To prepare the bears - and any other animal - for display they must first be skinned, which can be done without first opening the body cavity in a manner similar to the way you might skin a chicken before cooking it.

While the preservation of animal skins has been practised almost since the beginning of recorded civilisation, the earliest modern-style techniques were published in the middle of the 18th century in France.

It was in the 19th century that hunters began taking their trophies to upholstery shops, where they would have the skins sewn up and stuffed with cotton - a crude form of taxidermy that has given us the term 'stuffed animal'.

Team effort: Mr Aeillo prepares Canelle's skin as a colleague works on a piece of bone

These days, however, professional taxidermists prefer the term 'mounting' to 'stuffing', reflecting the effort that goes into the carefully sculpted bodies beneath the skin.

As the UK-based Guild of Taxidermist puts it: 'To say that a taxidermist stuffs animals is misleading. In fact the skin is removed, preserved and arranged around a model of the original body.

'A good knowledge of anatomy is essential to create the artificial body or 'form'. Artistic talent is needed to finish the specimen and set up a natural display.

'A good taxidermist is a sculptor, artist and naturalist rolled into one.'

Toulouse's museum is billing their exhibition, which will feature bears from across the world, as the event of the year.

It will open in October, on the centenary of the invention of the teddy bear.
