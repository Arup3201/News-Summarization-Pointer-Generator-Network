Outside court: Claire Moore booked an appointment for lip filler and three Botox jabs worth £490

A 40-year-old wife visited a beauty salon for wrinkle-busting Botox injections in a bid to impress her husband - and then ran off without paying, a court heard.

Claire Moore had booked an appointment for last October at the National Slimming and Cosmetic Clinic in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for lip filler and three Botox jabs worth a total of £490.

But she asked the doctor to stop after just one dose of the wrinkle-curing treatment and dashed for the exit, Alex Dabson, prosecuting, told Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court.

Moore told staff she had left her bank card in her car and would return with £180 for the treatment - but never did. She knew she had to pay ‘on the spot’ but ‘dishonestly made off’, the court heard.

Mrs Dabson said: ‘She made an appointment for herself and a friend, went to the clinic, and gave her details using her maiden name.

'She was supposed to have three injections but only had the one. When it came to paying, she said she had to get her purse from the car.

'She left but came back saying she did not have her keys, and asked her friend - who was still waiting for treatment - to go. She simply ran out of the clinic and did not pay.

'In police interview, she admitted going to the clinic and having the injection. She said she intended to pay but then thought “Sod it!” and decided not to.

‘She said she gave her maiden name because she did not want her husband to find out she was having the treatment.’

Kate Rowe, defending, said: ‘When she 
went to her car to get her card she was intending to pay. However, she 
did not go back to pay. Obviously, she was under a duty to do so.’

'She left but came back saying she did not have her keys, and asked her friend - who was still waiting for treatment - to go'

Alex Dabson, prosecuting

Moore stood expressionless in the dock as she admitted one charge of making off without payment. She has previous convictions for theft and making a false statement to obtain benefit, dating back to 1993 and 2001 respectively.

Magistrates gave her a one-year conditional discharge, and ordered her to pay £180 compensation, £85 court costs, and £15 into a fund for victims of crime.
