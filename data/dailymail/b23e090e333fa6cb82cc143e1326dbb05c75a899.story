More of the recorded call between Donald Sterling and a longtime friend has revealed that he claims to have made the racist comments in an effort to try to bed his much younger assistant.

'I’m talking to a girl. I’m trying to have sex with her. I’m trying to play with her. If you were trying to have sex with a girl and you’re talking to her privately and you don’t think anybody’s there, you may say anything in the world!' Sterling claims in the recording.

The woman in question is V. Stiviano, who has long been described as Sterling's mistress but that has now been denied by both parties.

This latest recording was released just 
hours before the NBA announced that they have chosen Dick Parsons, a 
former Citigroup chairman and former Time Warner chairman and CEO, as 
the interim CEO of the Clippers.

Keeping tabs: Donald Sterling has claimed that he didn't want V. Stiviano bringing any other men- including black men- to Clippers games because he wanted to sleep with her

'Silly rabbit': Stiviano has previously claimed that they did not have a sexual relationship but she considers herself his 'silly rabbit'

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement Friday that Parsons 'will bring extraordinary leadership 
and immediate stability to the Clippers organization.'

With
 Sterling banned from anything to do with the team or league, and team 
President Andy Roeser on an indefinite leave of absence, the league and 
Clippers worked together to find a CEO.

Parsons,
 who has also been on President Barack Obama's economic advisory team, 
says he has been 'deeply troubled' by the Clippers' situation.

In the latest recording obtained by Radar Online, Sterling tells his friend- who is only identified as being a longtime confidante- that he and Stiviano have never had sex but he hoped to change that. 

'The girl is black. I like her. I’m jealous that she’s with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell. Can’t I in private tell her, "I don’t want you to be with anybody?"' Sterling said.

'Am I a person? Do I have freedom of speech?!'

The recording between Sterling and Stiviano that prompted his permanent ban from the NBA surrounded his problem with her posting a picture with Magic Johnson on her Instagram feed.

Now he claims that his problems weren't with the people in the photo but the fact that they might be obstacles for Sterling's own romanitic plans.

Woman at the center of it all: Stiviano has long been described as Sterling's mistress but they both claim they never slept together

Accessorizing: Stiviano has not shied from the media spotlight- with the exception of her visor- since her recording with Sterling was released

Her image: The original racist recording stemmed from a photo that she put on her Instagram feed with Magic Johnson, and this was another photo she had on her feed

'The picture is not (the issue). I wish Magic Johnson was talking to a girl and you trying to play with her, and you might say anything. You might say you have the biggest penis in the world! I would have said I could fly over a high rise building if I had to!' he is heard saying on the latest recording.

'I didn't want her to bring anybody to my games because I was jealous, I mean I'm being honest. No one's going to hear it but you and me so.'

The first portion of this latest tape was released on Thursday and the anonymous friend reportedly signed an affidavit swearing that Sterling is the other man on the line. He did not, however, say anything about whether or not Sterling was aware that the tape would be released or if he was aware that the call was being recorded.

'I have a girl here who has black kids and is partly black I think herself. I love the girl,' Sterling said. 

'So they should take away for life your team (if) you say the wrong thing to a girl? I know what I said was wrong. But I never thought the private conversation would go anywhere, out to the public.'

Scandal: Sterling's problems started when a secretly-recorded phone call with his girlfriend V. Stiviano (left) was released and he was heard complaining that she wanted to post photos of herself with Magic Johnson

Under investigation: Donald Sterling and his estranged wife Shelly (pictured in 2011) have both previously been cited in old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants and now she is reportedly being investigated by the NBA

He also implied that the original taped conversation with Stiviano happened three months before it was released last weekend, but that has not been verified.

The NBA made their announcement about Parsons Friday afternoon. He will oversee the franchise while the league tries to force owner Donald Sterling to sell it following his lifetime ban for making racist remarks.

Today is the first time the 80-year-old's plot to somehow woo 31-year-old Stiviano has been used as an attempted justification for his statements, as he was heard using his Jewish heritage and desire to win basketball games in the portion of the tape released yesterday.

'How can you be in this business and 
be a racist? Do you think I tell the coach to get white players? Or to 
get the best player he can get?' he said at one point.

'I
 grew up in East L.A.... I was the president of the high school there. I
 mean, and I’m a Jew! And 50 per cent of the people there were black and
 40 per cent were Hispanic.

'So I mean, people must have a good feeling for me.'

Sterling talked about the scandal and specifically references the Instagram photo of his girlfriend V. Stiviano and Magic Johnson that reportedly prompted his backlash during a recorded call with her.

'It breaks my heart that Magic Johnson, a guy that I respect so much, wouldn’t stand up and say, "Well let’s get the facts. Let’s get him and talk to him." Nobody tried. Nobody!'

If the recording is real, it would be the first time that Sterling has been heard from since he was banned from the NBA for life following the first recording of his conversation with V. Stiviano.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that he hopes that the league's board of governors will vote to force Sterling to sell the LA basketball team that he has owned since 1981, but in this latest recording, Sterling made it clear that he does not intend to go without a fight.

Ban: In April NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (pictured) announced a lifetime suspension and a $2.5million fine for Donald Sterling after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light

'You can’t force someone to sell property in America! I’m a lawyer, that’s my opinion,' Sterling said.

In spite of his beliefs, the NBA is going ahead with their own process, as the advisory and finance committee held their second conference call in as many weeks in order to discuss their options and the timetable of a possible forced sale.

Sterling has been banned from the NBA for life, is not allowed to have any role in the running of the Clippers nor attend any games or practices.

The 'death sentence' came after tapes were released where Sterling was heard saying that he didn't want his mixed-race girlfriend to post photos showing that she was spending time with African Americans.

The punishment, which also included a $2.5million fine, came after the NBA investigated and met with Sterling, but there are reports that his estranged wife Shelly Sterling is also being investigated because of some old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants who accused her of using racial slurs.
