Fresh from winning the Cricket World Cup, Australia have recovered from their celebrations to name their 17-man squad to defend the Ashes against England this summer.

Alastair Cook and Co must face some of the sport's fastest bowlers, less than 15 months after pace man Mitchell Johnson condemned England to a humiliating 5-0 defeat.

Here, Sportsmail's cricket expert Lawrence Booth runs the rule of the aggressive quicks looking to condemn England to a speedy defeat.

Mitchell Johnson heads the list of Australia's fast paced bowlers heading to England for the Ashes

Johnson's pace bowling terrorised England as Australia ran out 5-0 victors in the Ashes last year

MITCHELL JOHNSON

Left-arm fast

Top speed: 95mph

Main weapon: The bouncer into the right-hander’s armpit

Verbals? Oh, yes — delivered in proportion to the length of his moustache

Fear factor: 9/10

Ryan Harris returns to the Test side after being on Australia's winning side at the last Ashes

RYAN HARRIS

Right-arm fast

Top speed: 93mph

Main weapon: Almost inhuman accuracy, allied with subtle seam movement

Verbals? Tends to let his bowling do the talking — it’s usually enough

Fear factor: 8/10

Player of the World Cup Mitchell Starc is another quick bowler that England will need to be wary of

MITCHELL STARC

Left-arm fast

Top speed: 92mph

Main weapon: His yorker was nearly unplayable during the World Cup

Verbals? Never afraid to get stuck in — and can go too far

Fear factor: 8/10

Rising star Josh Hazlewood will be another fast paced Australia bowler to beware of this summer

JOSH HAZLEWOOD

Right-arm fast

Top speed: 90mph

Main weapon: A tidy action and a Glenn McGrath-like ability to hit the same spot, time and again.

Verbals? On the quiet side, at least by Aussie standards

Fear factor: 7/10
