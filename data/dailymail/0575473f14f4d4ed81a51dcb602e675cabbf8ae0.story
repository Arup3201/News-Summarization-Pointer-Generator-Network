The president of Argentina has used her seat on the UN Security Council as an opportunity to blast Britain over the Falklands, comparing the dispute over the island to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner left leading diplomats and even the Secretary-General waiting for half an hour before she arrived late to yesterday's meeting.

Argentina currently holds the presidency of the council - and though the position is not usually filled by a head of state, Mrs Kirchner used the opportunity to grandstand as she denounced the veto which leading powers wield over the powerful body.

The outspoken president turned up at the meeting in New York 25 minutes late, forcing Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, 14 foreign ministers and dozens of diplomats to fill in time before her arrival.

Once she arrived, Mrs Kirchner called for member states to implement UN resolutions immediately - singling out the Palestinian issue as well as a resolution for Britain and Argentina to negotiate over the future of the Falklands.

Argentina claims that the UK is illegally occupying the islands, but the president insisted: 'This isn't caprice, it isn't saying we're right.

'We are just saying that we would like the UN resolution to be implemented, that both countries should sit down and discuss a controversial matter.'

However, British ambassador Mark Lyall Grant pointed out that residents of the Falklands had voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the UK in a March referendum.

'There can be no discussion on the sovereignty of the islands unless and until the islanders so wish,' he said.

Mrs Kirchner said that the security council veto wielded by the U.S., UK, China, France and Russia was a Cold War relic which was intended to prevent 'nuclear holocaust'.

She pointed out that the U.S. and Russia today sit at the same table, adding: 'We can't deal with the problems in this new world with old instruments and old methods because they're not going to be suited.'

Russia and China have repeatedly vetoed security council resolutions designed to pressure Syrian president Bashar Al Assad to negotiate with opposition rebels, while the U.S. consistently vetoes measures aimed against Israel.

Mrs Kirchner devoted much of the meeting to discussing ways that the UN can co-operate with regional organisations such as the Arab League and the African Union.

Samantha Power, who was recently appointed as the U.S. ambassador to the UN, agreed that such organisations could help prevent atrocities but suggested that there were limits to how far they could bring countries together.

Mrs Kirchner expressed serious concern at reports by NSA leaker Edward Snowden that a U.S. spy program is widely targeting data in emails and telephone calls across Latin America.

She discussed the 'need to establish regulations of a global nature to ensure and protect sovereignty of states and privacy of citizens in the world.'
