An actor best known for a bit role in the first Austin Powers film pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he murdered his cell mate at a Southern California prison.

Joseph Son, 42, played Dr. Evil’s shoe-wielding henchman Random Task in 1997’s Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. He was arrested in 1998 for raping and torturing an Orange County woman years before.

Authorities say that just a month into Son’s life sentence, the mixed marital arts fighter killed his cell mate Charles Graham, 50, with a ‘combination of kicks and punches.’

Nothing to lose? The man who played Random Task in the first Austin Powers film has pleaded not guilty to killing his cell mate just a month into a life sentence for a 1990 gang rape and torture

Sex offender: Son, a mixed martial artist, is charged with killing cell mate, convicted child molester Charles Graham, in 2011

This, according to TMZ, where it’s been reported that Son could face the death penalty.

He is next scheduled to make an appearance on October 7 in Kern County Superior Court, reports the Bakersfield Californian.

Graham was serving out two years at Wasco State Prison for failing to register as a sex offender when prison authorities found him dead.

It was subsequently revealed that Graham was a convicted child molester.

The brutal nature of his murder will reportedly be taken into consideration as part of Son’s trial.

The official charge against Son, as read by Judge H.A. 'Skip' Staley is assault by a life prisoner with force causing death.

Son was serving life for helping rape and torture a woman on Christmas Eve in 1990.

Son and co-defendant Santiago Lopez Gaitan abducted the then-19-year-old victim as she was walking her dog by her apartment.

They then drove the woman to Huntington Beach and repeatedly raped and sodomized her in the back of the car at gunpoint.

They also pistol-whipped her and repeatedly threatened to kill her, counting the bullets and telling her she was going to die.

Prosecutors say the woman, identified in court papers as Jane Doe, begged for her life before Son and Gaitan released her, naked, badly injured and blindfolded with her own pants.She went to a local home, where police were called.

Evidence was collected from the woman that Christmas Eve, but the case eventually went cold.

It wasn't until Son pleaded guilty to felony vandalism in 2008 and violated probation that he was required to provide a DNA sample. That sample was linked to DNA collected from Doe in 1990.

Prosecutor Eric Scarborough said Son was sadist who took pleasure in terrifying his victim.
