Curry sauces from restaurants across the country are being urgently tested after three deaths were linked to an allergic reaction from peanuts in takeaways.

Safety chiefs fear a new food scandal with fraudsters adulterating expensive almond powder used to thicken sauces with cheap ground peanuts – a move which can prove fatal if the meal is eaten by someone suffering from a peanut allergy.

The Mail on Sunday has learned a criminal investigation is under way into the death of the latest victim – pub manager Paul Wilson, 38, from Helperby, near Thirsk, North Yorkshire. Police last week arrested two men, aged 38 and 51, in connection with his death. They have since been released on bail.

Connor Donaldson, 12, from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, and Derek Stephenson, 32, a gardener from Stanhope, Co ­Durham, have also died in separate cases. Some people suffer an allergic reaction if they eat any type of nut, but others can safely eat almonds and pistachios grown on trees and are only affected by peanuts – also known as ground nuts – grown in soil.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ordered councils to encourage restaurant owners to check their ingredients.

New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory. ‘We expect action to be taken against any businesses responsible for deliberately selling adulterated products,’ said the FSA.

Almond prices have doubled in a year and food chiefs believe cheaper ground peanuts are being added to almond powder, and some takeaway owners are using peanuts to save money.

Corrine Lowe, of the Trading Standards Institute, said: ‘Almond powder is being substituted with ground nut powder.

‘In some cases outlets are being incorrectly supplied. In others, they are buying the cheaper ground nut, and still describe meals as containing almond.’

Hazel Gowland, of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, said: ‘Cases linked to takeaways are becoming more common and something in the food chain has changed.

‘There are people who have eaten the same takeaway every week for years who were fine, but who have now died.’

Schoolboy Connor died after eating a prawn balti which staff at the restaurant said did not contain nuts.

Tests carried out by Wigan Council later found the almond powder used was adulterated and bulked up with at least 50 per cent peanut powder. A council spokesman said that an investigation was continuing.
