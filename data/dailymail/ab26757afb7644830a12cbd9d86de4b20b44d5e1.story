An outbreak of a rare skin infection is sweeping through New York City's Chinatowns, according to a warning issued by the Health Department.

The department was informed of the outbreak by doctors servicing the Chinese community in New York, who have reported at least 30 cases of Mycobacterium marinum.

The rare skin infection causes red, tender lumps and if untreated, could require surgery.

Outbreak: Thirty cases of Mycobacterium marinum have been reported in the New York Cit area. Everyone who has been infected reported having come into contact with live or raw seafood at Chinatown markets

Warning: Health Department officials are telling venders and buyers to wear waterproof gloves when handling seafood at the Chinatown markets in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn

Everyone of the infected admitted to coming in contact with live or raw seafood sold at Chinatown markets in either Lower Manhattan; Flushing, Queens; or Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

Dr Jay Varma, the health department's deputy commission for disease control, told 1010 WINS that the outbreak is still under investigation, but that they're warning anyone who comes into contact with the seafood at the markets to wear waterproof gloves.

'This is a very uncommon bacteria so the fact that we’ve detected 30 cases so far suggests that something has changed, either about the water in the tank or the tanks themselves or the types of fish or seafood that are causing this problem,' Dr Varma said.

People are more susceptible to getting the infection if they have an exposed cut or wound where the bacteria can enter the body.

Tell your doctor: If untreated, the infection could become so serious as to require surgery

Other symptoms of the infection include swelling under the skin, swelling or pain in the hands or arms and difficulty moving fingers.

Anyone who experiences these symptoms is being told to see a doctor, as early antibiotic treatment is crucial in clearing up the infection.

'Because this infection can look like any other common skin infection, a number of people have gone weeks and sometimes even months before they’ve had an accurate diagnosis,' Dr Varma said.

There is no threat in eating any of the fish sourced form the markets, and it can't be spread from person to person.
