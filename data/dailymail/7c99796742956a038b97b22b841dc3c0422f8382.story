Alex Pearce’s defensive nightmare handed Cardiff City a 2-1 triumph to extend Russell Slade’s perfect home record.

The Reading defender s​cored an own goal, conceded a penalty and was sent off in a shambolic first-half performance to give Vincent Tan’s chosen man his fourth successive win at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Michael Hector hit a consolation goal for the Royals but it could not stop their dire run of just two wins in 12 games.

Glenn Murray tested home goalkeeper David Marshall early on as the visitors found space between the Cardiff City midfield and defence.

But their bright start was extinguished by one of their own after 19 minutes when Pearce diverted Peter Whittingham’s corner past Adam Federici - who was yet to make a save.

Former Royals defender Sean Morrison proved a handful in the Reading penalty area and Pearce only had eyes for his man when Whittingham sent his kick curling in.

Confusion reigned in the away side’s defence and the ball had deflected off the leg of Pearce and past the Federici before either knew anything about it.

Hal Robson-Kanu led the search for an equaliser before half-time with a testing drive at the same end he scored his match-winning goal for Wales against Cyprus last month.

Both sides seemed content to head in at half-time with the score at 1-0 after Anthony Pilkington and Danny Williams were booked for their part in a melee, but the evening was about to go from bad to worse for Pearce.

Former Madjeski favourite Adam Le Fondre controlled a searching Peter Whittingham ball 18 yards from goal and tried to beat Pearce, who had found himself one-on-one with the tricky attacker.

The Ireland international dragged Le Fondre down and referee James Linington pointed to the spot and pulled a red card out of his pocket.

Whittingham finished the move he started by sending the Australian goalkeeper the wrong way to give Cardiff a flattering 2-0 half-time lead.

Simon Cox was sacrificed for Gareth McLeary at the break as Nigel Adkins sought to shore things up at the back.

But the early signs were not good as Anthony Pilkington and Craig Noone burst down the flanks but saw their shots fly high and wide.

Le Fondre was next to test the away side’s three-man defence as the home side took advantage of their one-man advantage.

But Cardiff did themselves no favours as they let their possession advantage go to waste with some sloppy defending.

Michael Hector got his side back in the game with Reading’s first foray into enemy territory in the second period.

Whittingham and Mats Daehli both failed to clear a corner from the left hand side and Hector pounced to slide the ball through Marshall’s legs to give his side a glimmer of hope.

Blackman had Cardiff fans sweating when he went over in the box as the clock hit 90 minutes, but Linington pulled out his yellow card for a dive.
