The man accused of murdering a Sydney newsagent owner and his family tried to take over the business just months after their deaths, a court has been told.

Newsagent Norman Lin, his wife Lily, their two sons and Lily's sister were found dead in their North Epping home in July 2009.

Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, who is also Mr Lin's brother-in-law, has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges.

Yang Fei Lin, the father of a murdered Sydney newsagent owner, told a court on Monday that his son-in-law tried to take over the business just months after he allegedly murdered five members of the Lin family

Mr Lin's father, Yang Fei Lin, told the court on Monday that as discussions about the family's assets were carried out three months after the deaths, Xie asked to take over the small business worth about $500,000.

'We were already running the newsagency, we didn't need his interference,' he told the court through a Mandarin interpreter.

'His purpose was to take over the newsagency.'

Xie was told he would have to take care of business loans and interest payments but Mr Lin said Xie was adamant he didn't have to pay off debt and disputed the estimated $2 million value.

Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie asked to take over his dead brother-in-law's North Epping newsagent, which was worth about $500,000

The family's home in North Epping was worth about $1.2 million, they owned a $300,000 unit at Merrylands and the newsagency was valued at $500,000, according to Mr Lin.

He also tried to stop Xie from attending meetings about the potential sale of the newsagency.

The court heard Xie and his wife Kathy wanted to buy a newsagency and were trying to sell a restaurant in Melbourne.

Feng Qing Zhu, Norman Lin's mother, arrived at court on Monday as her son-in-law Xie stands accused of murdering Norman, his wife Lily, their two sons and Lily's sister

The late Mr Lin had invited Xie to inspect his business's books, but the accused never took him up on the offer.

Mr Lin also told Xie to stay out of family business as a son-in-law is only perceived as a 'half member' of a family in Chinese culture, the court heard.

Xie stands accused of using a hammer-like weapon to carry out the 2009 murders and the court previously heard the family's wounds were so traumatic police thought a shotgun had been used.
