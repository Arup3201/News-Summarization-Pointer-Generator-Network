Leeds United are in talks with Southampton over a deal for striker Billy Sharp.

The Sheffield born 28-year-old has one-year remaining on his deal at Southampton but the Premier League club are ready to offload the striker.

Sharp has spent most of the last two seasons on loan in the championship with Nottingham Forest, Reading and Doncaster Rovers.

The Whites are keen to sign another established striker following the departure of Ross McCormack to Championship rivals Fulham this transfer window.

Head Coach Dave Hockaday will be looking for more firepower at Leeds having lost their opening Championship fixture 2-0 at Millwall on Saturday.

Meanwhile Leeds have agreed a deal with Chesterfield for defender Liam Cooper and Catania for Italian defender Giuseppe Bellusci.
