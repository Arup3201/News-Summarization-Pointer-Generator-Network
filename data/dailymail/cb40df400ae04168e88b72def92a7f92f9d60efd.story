When Gareth Bale's  flick put Hal Robson-Kanu through to double  Wales' lead against Cyprus, it was evidence of what the £85million Real Madrid star can bring to the international stage.

But Reading's Robson-Kanu insists the former Tottenham winger  is not the only Wales player capable of having 'those moments of genius' that win games.

Robson-Kanu believes 10-man Wales' 2-1 win against Cyprus to move top of Group B was the product of a team pulling their weight from captain Ashley Williams to the kit men.

'(Bale's) a world class player. That’s what you get,' Robson-Kanu told Sportsmail. 'We’re obviously lucky to have players like that within the squad, but it’s about all the players. It’s about the squad.

'We’ve got other players throughout the whole squad who can have those moments of genius which can win us games.

'The manager, Chris Coleman, the staff,  Kit Symons, Osian Roberts, even down to the kit men, everyone is pulling in the right direction.

'And that’s credit to the manager who has got everyone onside and fighting for the cause. We’re definitely looking to achieve something.' 

The Cyprus win was their second  after Coleman's men beat Andorra 2-1 before drawing 0-0 with Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Wales remain unbeaten with Belgium next but have not qualified for an international tournament since the 1958 World Cup.

Nevertheless Robson-Kanu admits seven points more than matches their target after three games, and the 25-year-old says confidence just keeps growing in the Wales camp.

'We know we’ve got the ability but in the past, squads haven’t been able to get it over the line,' he adds. 'We’re more than confident that we’ll be able to do it.

'Going into the campaign, we had our targets of what we would like to achieve. After three games, having seven points, we’re definitely on course. It’s important we maintain that now and carry it through.' 

So, what about Belgium and their host of Premier League stars which includes Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard, and Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany?

'Last campaign (in 2014 World Cup qualifying), we had them again and both home and away  we showed that we can compete with them.

'It’ll be a good game and there’s no better time to play them as well coming off the back of the results we’ve had. We’ll be going into it full of confidence.'
