A father and daughter who were found shot dead may have died in a double suicide pact, police have revealed.

The bodies of Archie McKelvie, 64, and 31-year-old Corrin Barker were discovered in the kitchen of a flat in West Bridgford, Nottingham, last Thursday.

It is thought the tragedy may have been sparked by the death of Corrin's mother, and Mr McKelvie's former partner, just days earlier.

Pauline Barker's body was found floating in the River Trent close to Nottingham Racecourse in on April 15 - less than two weeks before the father and daughter were found dead.

It is believed she drowned, and her death is not being treated as suspicious.

Corrin and her father were discovered by police  when the investigation into Mrs Barker's death led them to Mr McKelvie's home.

Detectives are now trying to piece together the sequence of events that led to the deaths of Mr McKelvie and his daughter.

However, it is thought they are working on the theory that the pair were left so distraught at 56-year-old Mrs Barker's drowning that they agreed to end their own lives.

Detective Chief Inspector Kate Meynell, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'We know who is involved and we know how they died, we are now trying to piece together exactly when and why this happened.

'We have located Archie's, Corrin's and Pauline's relatives and are keeping them informed and supported at every stage of our investigation.

'They have been helping us with our inquiries into their loved ones' way of life, but we are now appealing to Nottinghamshire residents for more information about their final movements.

'Do you know Archie, Corrin or Pauline? They appear to have kept themselves to themselves, but we do believe they were known by some members of the West Bridgford community.

'If you know them, or recognise them 
from their pictures, and think you may have seen them around the time of
their deaths, please call us.

Deaths: Forensic officers remove evidence from the scene. The gun that was used to kill the father and daughter was found in the property

'The smallest, seemingly insignificant, piece of information to you could very well be a major lead for our investigation.'

Mr McKelvie was last seen at his home on 12.30pm last Tuesday while his daughter, from the Edwalton area, was last seen at 3pm on Wednesday in West Bridgford.

The final movements of Ms Barker’s mother, who was from the Lady Bay area, are unclear.

Police have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the tragedy.
