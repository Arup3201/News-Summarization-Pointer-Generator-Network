It has been called Surprize because of the reaction it gets when you take a bite.

Now the new variety of apple, which is yellowy-orange on the outside and pink on the inside, is about to hit supermarket shelves.

Sweet and aromatic, the Surprizes will be sold in around 120 Tesco stores and cost £1.75 for a pack of four.

The pink apple called the 'Surprize', which has been grown in orchards in Tillington, near Hereford 

Tesco fruit product developer Ciara Grace said: ‘This apple is a real head-turner on account of its unusual pale orange and yellow skin.

‘But the real fun starts when they take a bite and see the unique pink flesh inside. It was named Surprize because of the fantastic reaction it gets.

‘This is the first time it’s ever gone on sale and there are only limited supplies but if it’s a success we will stock it again next year.’ 

The Surprize has been developed by award-winning grower William Barnett at his 1,000-acre farm in Tillington, near Hereford. 

He previously created the Rosette Raspberry Ripple apple, which had red flesh.

The Surprizes will be sold in around 120 Tesco stores and cost £1.75 for a pack of four 

He said: ‘Britain can be proud of its 4,000 or so different apple varieties but what I’ve set out to do is create something a little different for apple lovers.

‘My apple mission is to develop better and more interesting varieties of English apple.

‘I set off on that mission 10 years ago and since then have helped develop several popular new varieties including the Red Windsor; Tillington’s Delight and the Rosette Raspberry Ripple.”.
