The latest FBI attempt to find Jimmy Hoffa has ended in yet another dead end. Authorities announced today that they are calling off the excavation of a field in Oakland Township, Michigan, that was once owned by a reputed Michigan mob boss.

An aging former mob boss told federal agents that Hoffa was buried in a shallow grave under a concrete slab in the field after he was murdered in 1975. The agents found the slab, but not Hoffa's remains.

The government has followed up on some 15 credible leads as to the whereabouts of the once-powerful union leader, but his final resting place remains a mystery. CNN estimates the search has cost taxpayers $3million in the last four decades.

'We did not uncover any evidence relevant to the investigation on James Hoffa,' said Robert Foley, head of the FBI in Detroit.

Law enforcement officials help search the area in Oakland Township, Michigan on Tuesday where they believe the remains of Teamsters union president Jimmy Hoffa might be buried

Agents uncovered concrete slabs from a field where they have been digging. They believe the slabs may belong to the foundation of a barn that once stood on the property, under which Hoffa may have been buried

'I am very confident of our result 
here after two-days-plus of diligent effort. As of this point, we'll be 
closing down the excavation operation.'

Previous searches have included the 
suburban Detroit home a former mob enforcer and an eastern Michigan 
horse farm and a backyard swimming pool. It has also been claimed 
Hoffa's remains are entombed beneath the former Giants Stadium in New 
Jersey and beneath the headquarters of General Motors.

All investigations into Hoffa's whereabouts have turned out to be both costly and fruitless.

The feds had high hopes for this dig. The source of the tip was Tony Zerilli, an 85-year-old former mobster who said he was told the location of Hoffa's body by a hitman who claimed to have killed him.

'The bureau had a short list of 
people they wanted to talk to about that and I can’t think of anybody on
that list who was more highly placed then Anthony Zerilli,' former U.S.
Attorney Keith Corbett told WDIV-TV in January. 'This is certainly the 
most interesting and attractive lead that has come up since I’ve been 
involved with this - and I think the bureau would react the same way.'

But, officials came up short again.

'Certainly, we're disappointed,' FBI head Foley told reporters Wednesday.

He said about 40 agents were involved
in an operation that covered about an acre. The FBI has not put a cost 
on the search, but Foley said it's more important to solve a case.

'With any investigation we consider 
cost-benefits analysis,' he said. 'The FBI and its partners are no 
corporations. We do not have a profit margin as a bottom line.'

CNN estimates that search for Hoffa has cost taxpayers $3million over the years.

Hoffa's rise in the Teamsters, his 
1964 conviction for jury tampering and his presumed murder are Detroit's
link to a time when organized crime, public corruption and mob hits 
held the nation's attention. Over the years, authorities have received 
various tips, leading the FBI to possible burial sites near and far.

In 2003, a backyard swimming pool was
dug up 90 miles northwest of Detroit. Seven years ago, a tip from an 
ailing federal inmate led to a two-week search and excavation at a horse
farm in the same region. Last year, soil samples were taken from under 
the concrete floor of a backyard shed north of the city. And detectives 
even pulled up floorboards at a Detroit house in 2004.

Hunt for Hoffa: The field where FBI agents are searching is 20 miles north of the suburban Detroit restaurant where he was last seen in 1975

Other theories have suggested he was 
entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, ground up and 
thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a mob-owned fat-rendering 
plant.

The excavation site was 20 miles north of the restaurant where Hoffa was last seen in July 1975. Zerilli, 85, has said Hoffa was murdered by mobsters who dumped his body in a shallow grave.

The property was owned in 1975 by 
Jack Tocco, Zerilli's cousin, who reportedly became head of the Detroit 
mafia after Hoffa vanished.

A house and barn used to stand on the land, though both building were later torn down.

Zerilli
says Hoffa was taken to the property after meeting with two organized 
crime figures at the Macus Red Fox Restaurant in Bloomfield Hills, 
Michigan.

The mob insider said he was told by a mob enforcer that Hoffa, 62, was executed on the property and then buried.

Mob royalty: Tony Zerilli, 85, was the second in command of the Detroit mafia before he was indicted and sent to prison. Now, he says, he's 'dead broke'

The mafia initially planned to move the body to a hunting lodge upstate, but police pressure became so intense after Hoffa's disappearance that 'once he was buried here he was buried and they let it go,' Zerilli told WDIV in an interview in January.

Zerilli and his cousin Tocco, led the organized crime families in Detroit until 1996, when both were indicted on racketeering charges. 

He was sent to prison in 2002 and released in 2008.

'Clearly
when he returned [from prison] he would’ve been a person, based on his position in 
the hierarchy, who would have been able to learn the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the disappearance of James Earl Hoffa,' said 
Corbett.

Despite being mob royalty, Zerilli says he is now 'dead broke.' When he went to Tocco and asked for money, he said, Tocco refused.

Now, Zerilli is writing a book about the Detroit Partnership - the Motor City's mafia.

Fanning out: Federal agents spread out across the property. There is no telling how much of the field they will have to excavate

It's unknown how long the FBI will have to search the property to determine whether or not Hoffa is buried there
