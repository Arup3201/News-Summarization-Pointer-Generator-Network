They may look fragile but a video has shown just how fierce and nimble the praying mantis can be.

The clip shows a 'wandering violin' mantis being antagonised by its owner's thumb.

It stands on its rear legs, weaves like an experienced fighter before delivering multiple strikes in an attempt to take down its human prey.

The clip shows a wandering violin mantis (pictured) being antagonised by its owners thumb. It stands on its rear legs, weaves like a boxer before delivering multiple strikes to its human prey. The video was uploaded by Polish YouTube user known as Marcin Zając and begins with the mantis balanced on the edge of a hand

The video was uploaded by a Polish YouTube user known as Marcin Zając and begins with the mantis balanced on the edge of a hand.

The insect - also known as Gongylus gongylodes - is stood on its back legs with its tibial spines tucked close to its body.

When the thumb strokes the spines the mantis reacts and lifts them and its front legs above its head.

It attacks the thumb twice in quick succession and when the thumb moves from left to right, the mantis ‘weaves’ in time before attacking it again.

This weaving movement is also used in the wild to make the insects mimic leaves swaying in the wind.

The insect in the video is believed to be a female of the wandering violin mantis species, also known as Gongylus gongylodes. 

It gets its name from the fact it resembles a violin, and the species is typically found in Southern India and Sri Lanka. 

The insects are distinctive because their ‘prothorax' or neck is more elongated and narrow than other species.

When threatened, praying mantids make themselves taller and spread their appendages to make them appear larger and more imposing.

In the case of the wandering violin mantis, females have wings that only cover a quarter of their abdomen.

When threatened, praying mantids make themselves taller and spread their appendages to make them appear larger and more imposing.

Many fan their wings and open their mouths too, and this is particularly seen on mantids who have brightly coloured or patterned wings.

If they continue to feel threatened they strike to attempt to pinch and bite.

Mantids do not develop wings until the final molt, while some don’t develop wings or have small flightless wings.

In the case of the wandering violin mantis, which gets its name because it resembles the musical instrument, females have wings that only cover a quarter of their abdomen.

Males have larger wings because they use them as part of the mating ritual when a female emits pheromones.

It is believed the mantis in the video is a female.

The movements of mantids have inspired a range of martial arts, and the Praying Mantis move was made famous in the 1984 film The Karate Kid (pictured)
