Just three days into life and little Prince George is already having the same effect on sales of baby-themed paraphernalia as his mother has on fashion.

The aden + anais bird-decorated muslin wrap he was wrapped in by his parents upon leaving the Lindo Wing has already sold out, and now the small, family-run Nottingham-based firm behind his white Merino wool christening shawl admit they, too, have been inundated by orders.

GH Hurt & Son Ltd, which has a long-standing connection with the Royal Family, sent the couple one of their £45 merino christening shawls. It was identical to one William had when he was a baby.

The GH Hurt & Son Ltd shawl in which baby Prince George was wrapped is exactly the same as the one Prince William was swaddled in by his mother Diana 31 years ago

Tiny George was kept cosy and warm inside the shawl, which is made from super-fine Merino wool

When they realised the new family had used their wrap to show little George to the world for the very first time, Gillian Taylor, the company's director, said they felt 'honoured'.

A source from the firm told MailOnline: 'The 
phone has been ringing off the hook and we have been taking more online 
orders than we have ever seen before.

'We had no idea that they were going to use it until we saw the television footage ourselves. We were dancing with joy.'

GH Hurt & Son Ltd say they have been inundated with calls about Prince George's shawl, and were overjoyed when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose to wrap their newborn in it upon leaving hospital

G.H.Hurt & Son have been supplying lace knitwear since 1912 from The Shawl Factory in Nottingham.

The company says: 'We design and manufacture best quality ladies shawls and scarves, baby christening shawls and a variety of heritage knitted lace products celebrating 400 years of this proud British industry. 

'Whether you are looking for a beautiful lace scarf or stole, we have the latest seasons styles and colours to complete any outfit.

'Our collection of vintage handframe machines, designed by Rev. William Lee in 1589, work alongside the most modern knitting technology to produce exquisite fashion products evoking the Orenburg and Shetland styles.'

First we had the Kate Middleton 
Effect. Then we had the Duchess Effect. And now, a mere three days after
 his birth and following just one public appearance, we seem to be 
witnessing the Prince George Effect.

But
 while his mother Kate is cited as one of the most influential figures 
within the fashion industry, with anything she wears immediately flying 
off shelves and into wardrobes, her baby is boosting sales of a much 
more simple item: swaddling muslins.

The £12 printed white aden + anais
 cloth in which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wrapped their baby son
 before leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, has 
already sold out.

The patterned muslin cloth in which 
his proud parents swaddled him for their first public appearance as a 
family was just visible poking out from beneath his white blanket - and 
it's a brand that has already proved popular with celebrity parents 
including Jools and Jamie Oliver, Jessica Alba and Peaches Geldof. such 
as Jamie Oliver and Jessica Alba.

The
100 per cent cotton design was white with a pattern of pale green cartoon
 birds, named the Sweet Bird Print. It comes in a pack of four called 
Jungle Jam, retailing at £44.95, with the other clothes decorated with monkeys, elephants and giraffes.

Company founder Raegan Moya-Jones told the Telegraph:
 'We are truly grateful and so delighted that the couple chose to debut 
the prince in aden + anais, it is such an honour! We wish the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge many congratulations on the birth of their son.'
