Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev will have his appeal against a seven-match ban for racism heard next week.

The Bulgaria international, who is on loan at Parkhead from English Premier League outfit Aston Villa, was accused of racially abusing Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan during a match between the two clubs in Glasgow in September.

Logan claimed the Celtic player had called him a “black c***” and immediately reported the matter to his captain Mark Reynolds, manager Derek McInnes and referee Bobby Madden.

Despite Tonev vigorously protesting his innocence at a hearing at Hampden Park last month, where he was accompanied by Celtic assistant boss John Collins, he was found guilty.

Celtic immediately publically backed their player and launched an appeal, which the Scottish FA have now announced will be heard back at Hampden on Thursday, December 4.
