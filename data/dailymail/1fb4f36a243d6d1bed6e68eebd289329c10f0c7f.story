Tragic: Elouise Keeling, 14, died after she had an asthma attack while she was at an Air Cadet meeting

An inquiry has been opened after a 14-year-old girl died from an asthma attack while an ambulance went to the wrong address.

Paramedics were called when Elouise Keeling collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets meeting at an RAF base.

But a call handler is said to have sent the ambulance to another base seven miles away.

By the time a second ambulance arrived at the correct location, crews were unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Last night her mother Karen Keeling, 33, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘We are totally devastated by Elouise’s death.

‘We hope no one ever has to go through pain like this.’

Elouise was at an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton on June 25 when she suffered the severe asthma attack despite not having participated in any games.

A senior cadet called 999 at 7.44pm and asked the call handler to send an ambulance. But the crew was wrongly dispatched to RAF Wyton, on the other side of Huntingdon.

When no ambulance arrived, cadet leaders made a second call to 999 and another ambulance was sent to the correct address.

It arrived 19 minutes after the first call, more than twice the target time of eight minutes.

The East of England Ambulance Service Trust yesterday admitted the delay may have contributed to her death and launched an investigation into whether it was the decisive factor.

Delays: Emergency services were called when Elouise had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died

Elouise’s mother had already reached the base when paramedics arrived and watched in horror as they tried to save her.

Last night at the family’s £290,000 home, Mrs Keeling said: ‘We just want justice for our Ellie.

‘She was a bright, happy and healthy young girl who had so much ahead of her and so much of her life to look forward to.

Missed: Elouise was described as bright, bubbly and popular by her school tutor

‘We hope our daughter’s death means that no family has to suffer in this way again.’ She said: ‘They have heard the recording of the call and it was the handler who made the error. They sent it to the wrong place.’

Elouise was described by teachers at Hinchingbrooke School as ‘a bright, bubbly girl who was very popular, particularly with her tutor group.’

The ambulance service is investigating the death as well as another incident where paramedics arrived late.

John Martin, interim director of clinical quality at the Trust, told its board meeting: ‘Both of these incidents focus around delays and they are being investigated to find whether this was the specific cause.’

Cambridge MP Julian Huppert criticised the Trust yesterday, saying: ‘It has been well-documented that there have been catastrophic problems with this service due to poor leadership which has resulted in the resignation of many of the directors.’

An inquest has been opened by the local coroner.

Lost: Three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital

In December, 79-year-old Barry Edwards died after an ambulance took two-and-a-half hours to arrive. Mr Edwards only lived just over a mile from Addenbrooke Hospital, Cambridge, where he was eventually treated, but it was only after three calls to 999 that an ambulance was sent from 83 miles away in Great Yarmouth to take him to hospital. He died the next morning.

In January an unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission warned the East of England Ambulance Service Trust to improve its care of patients after receiving several complaints from people who had waited up to three hours for an ambulance to take them to hospital.

Later that month, police officers complained that they were having to take patients to hospital 'on a daily basis' because no EEAST ambulances were available, and were regularly having to wait 'an inordinate amount of time' for their paramedic colleagues to arrive at the scene of an emergency.

A week later, firefighters warned that something was 'going seriously wrong with the 999 response' of the EEAST. They said they were waiting 'longer and longer' for ambulances to arrive and found paramedics often arrived alone on motorbikes or cars and were unable to transport patients to hospital. Keith Handscomb, of East Anglia FBU, said: 'Fire officers tell us of their desperate frustration at being told to 
wait in line when chasing up emergency requests for the attendance of an
ambulance. Sometimes they are told the ambulance sent to their emergency has been 
redirected to another call due to there being no other ambulance 
available.'

In March, three-month-old Bella Hellings died after she suffered a fit and the ambulance that was supposed to be taking her to hospital got lost twice. The driver had been relying on a satnav and took 26 minutes to reach her at home in Bury St Edmunds, more than three times the target time of eight minutes. They got lost again on the way to hospital, where Bella was pronounced dead.
