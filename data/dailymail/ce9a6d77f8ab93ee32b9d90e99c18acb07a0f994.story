Real Madrid appeared in good spirits as the Spanish side trained on Monday ahead of the Champions League clash with Liverpool at the Bernabeu.

It was an early start in Madrid for the Galacticos as Real boss Carlo Ancelotti led a morning training session at Valdebebas.

And there were smiles aplenty after Madrid picked up their 11th straight victory with a 4-0 away win against Granada on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Liverpool are on their way to Madrid as they look for revenge after their 3-0 defeat by Real at Anfield a fortnight ago.

The team arrived at Melwood on Monday morning before taking the short journey by coach to John Lennon Airport for their flight to the Spanish capital.

Daniel Sturridge is part of the travelling group as he posted a picture on Instagram from the team flight alongside Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic and Raheem Sterling. 

It is not known, however, whether the striker is ready to return, something Liverpool desperately need.

They have floundered without Sturridge's goals and lost 1-0 at Newcastle on Saturday.
