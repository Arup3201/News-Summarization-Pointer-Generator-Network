A curious woman had to be rescued by a crew of firemen after she became stuck between two giant rocks - because she wanted to try and sneak through the tiny gap.

The woman became wedged between the boulders after her bottom and breasts could not make it through the opening in the popular tourist city of Mudanjiang in Heilongjiang Province, northeast China.

The frightening scenario had echoes of the film 127 hours, which is based on the ordeal of real-life canyoneer Aron Ralston, whose arm became trapped in a crevice in Blue John Canyon, Utah, in April 2003.

The woman became trapped between two boulders after her curiosity got 
the better of her and she tried to sneak through a thin gap

The incident took place in the popular tourist city Mudanjiang, in Heilongjiang Province, northeast China, which is known for its mountains

Twelve firemen had to spend 20 minutes reaching the the woman, before spending another 30 minutes using ropes to lift the woman out of the gap

The adventurer, who was played by James Franco in Danny Boyle's film adaptation, was deserted in the isolated slot for 127 hours, after slipping as he explored the area.

Fearing he would die alone, Ralston cut off his own arm with a penknife, as the only way of escape - an event which led to harrowing scenes in the film.

In that scenario, the explorer - who was played by James Franco in the 
film - had to cut off his arm to free himself from the tiny gap

But luckily, this woman's adventure did not have quite the same consequences.

Instead, twelve firemen spent more than 20 minutes reaching the woman, before spending another 30 minutes lifting and pulling her out of the gap using ropes.

The woman said afterwards that she tried to walk through the rock gap out of curiosity, but her bottom and breasts had wedged her tight.
