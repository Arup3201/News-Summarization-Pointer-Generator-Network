Greg Rutherford has revealed on Twitter how he tried to rescue an injured deer he found while out walking his dogs.  

The 28-year-old long-jumper, who won a gold medal for Britain at the London 2012 Olympics, discovered the young animal, which he later christened Doris, near his home in Milton Keynes. 

Rutherford called the RSPCA only to be told that the deer, which had broken its leg, would have to be euthanised because of its injury.

But the Olympian, decided instead to have the animal cared for by staff at the local TiggyWinkles animal hospital.

Revealing his attempts to rescue the deer to his 155,000 Twitter followers, he wrote: 'Just carried an injured deer about 2 miles home and now awaiting the RSPCA to come and help the little fella. Poor thing has a broken leg.'

He then provided updates, describing how staff at the animal hospital had put its leg in a splint and how they were hopeful it would survive.

Not wanting to leave it in pain, he carried it two miles and arrived home exhausted and covered in blood to the astonishment of his partner Susie. 

He is quoted in The Mirror as saying: 'After explaining what happened I called the RSPCA but they said if they did collect it then they would have to put it down. I didn't want this to happen.

'So I found a local animal sanctuary that's also a 24-hour animal hospital. They came and put the deer's leg in a splint and took it off to recover.'

Despite Rutherford's efforts and the care from staff at TiggyWinkles, Doris had to eventually be put down. 

Despite the best efforts of the long-jumper, Doris eventually had to be put to sleep by hospital staff 

The head nurse, Clare Campbell, is quoted in the Mirror as saying Doris was put down because she was suffering from 'horrific' pelvic injuries.

'We are still happy she was rescued because otherwise she would have taken days to die in agony in the wild. At least we were able to give her pain relief and keep her warm and dry,' she said. 

Mr Rutherford's spokesman said the Olympian was 'saddened' to hear of the animal's death.
