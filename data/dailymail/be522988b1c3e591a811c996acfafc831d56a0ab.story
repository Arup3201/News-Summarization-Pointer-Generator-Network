Tragic: Gloria Knowles, who was savaged to death by her daughter's dogs, pictured at Harrington's pie and mash shop, Tooting, where she worked

A great-grandmother died from shock caused by blood loss after being savaged by her daughter's five dogs, a post-mortem examination has found.

Gloria Knowles, 71, suffered a haemorrhage after the dogs - two Bordeaux French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a mongrel - pounced when she went to feed them at her daughter's house next door on Tuesday night.

Police said: 'A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as shock caused by a haemorrhage as a result of an attack by dogs.'

Initial reports suggested Mrs Knowles, a widow, suffered a fatal heart attack after the five animals attacked in Morden, south London.

Police said the dogs are still in a kennel while the investigation into the horrific tragedy continues, and do not know whether they will be destroyed.

The five animals pounced on Mrs Knowles, after she went into the garden to feed them as a favour to her daughter, Beverley Mason.

The widow was found dead at the scene in Morden, South London after the dogs – two 'giant' Bordeaux French mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel – seemed to suddenly turn on her.

Now Mrs Knowles’ family must decide the animals’ fate as police investigate.

All five dogs, who are said to be 'like family' to relatives, are currently at police-approved kennels.

Neighbour Nazir Hussein told the Daily Mirror it would be a difficult decision for the family. He said: ‘The dogs are like family to them.

‘Keeping the dogs would always remind them of what the animals did to their mum, which was horrendous. But they love those dogs and losing them would be very upsetting.

Another neighbour said: ‘They can’t understand what has happened and the fact that it is the dogs they loved so much that did this makes it even harder.’

The attack came as further calls were
made for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
to change the law to allow dog control rules to apply everywhere.

Currently,
police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack 
happens in public - and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs.

The Communications Union CWU, which represents postmen, is campaigning to change the law and said the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is failing to protect both dog owners and attack victims.

Mrs Knowles lived next door to her daughter, with her granddaughter, who has a baby of her own. 

The family has run Harrington's pie and mash shop in nearby Tooting, for several generations.

Mrs Knowles’ daughter, Mrs Mason, lives with her husband, Dylan, and her other three children. The couple own the dogs together. 

Mr Hussein, 65, said he had long been afraid of the family's dogs, describing them as 'vicious'.

Neighbour: Kevin Hamilton said he heard screaming but assumed it was one of Beverley's children

He said: 'I would see the dogs being walked in the park but I didn't want to walk near them.

'They were vicious dogs – you knew by how they pulled on the lead and you could hear them barking from my house.

'There were so many dogs something like this was bound to happen.'

Another neighbour, Kevin Hamilton, described hearing screams from Mrs Mason's house at 5:15pm but mistook the noise, thinking it had come from one of Mrs Knowles's grandchildren.

Accountant Mr Hamilton, 65, who lives in the other house next door to Mrs Mason, described hearing 'hysterical screaming and barking' as he watched television.

He only became aware of the attack when a police officer told him about it, explaining that Mrs Knowles was alone in the house when she went to feed the dogs. He said officers had told him it was Mr Mason who discovered Mrs Knowles's body. 

Mr Hamilton described the two mastiffs as 'real muscle dogs' with 'enormous chests', and said the animals had a 'pack mentality'.

He said: 'If one jumped on you it would certainly knock you over.' 

He revealed Mrs Mason also owned cats and that one of them was killed a few weeks ago after the dogs began playing with it.

He said: 'About two months ago they had this white cat which died.

Animals removed: Police have seized the two French Mastiffs, the American bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police-approved kennels pending the post-mortem

Tragedy: Dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where Gloria Knowles may have been mauled to death by the animals

'The cat used to sleep with the dogs and one of these dogs started to playfully toss it in the air. They have a pack mentality - so the others started doing it too.

'It survived initially and they wrapped it in a blanket, but it later passed away from shock. They are not the sort of dogs you would want to mess with.'

Two of the dogs are Bordeaux French mastiffs which is known as a well-natured, docile breed, according to expert Steve Jones.

Police are waiting for post-mortem results. A Met spokesman said last night: ‘None of the dogs seized are classified as dangerous dogs.

‘Nothing will be determined until a decision about whether there will be criminal proceedings is taken.’

Two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was mauled to death by an eight stone Neapolitan mastiff in Wallington, south London.

The dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body. Earlier this year its owner Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to ensure the dog's welfare and was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and pay costs of £3,300 at Croydon Magistrates' Court. 

In January Leslie Trotman, 83, died after he was mauled by a 'pitbull-type' dog that had broken out of his neighbour's garden in Brentford, West London.
