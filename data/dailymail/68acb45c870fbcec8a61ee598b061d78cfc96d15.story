Intimate never-before-seen images of Prince Charles and his sister Anne dancing on a beach in Norfolk have been released to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

One snapshot shows the Prince of Wales and his younger sister larking about on the sand with bathing towels wrapped around their waists, while others show Prince Philip trying out a ride-on toy at Balmoral and a bicycle that is clearly too small for him.

The images, released by the Royal family for a television show broadcast yesterday, also feature Charles at play in a toy car and giggling on board the deck of a boat.

Other images show Charles leaping from the top of a sand dune, tumbling as he hits the ground.

They are the kind of happy holiday snapshot that grace family photograph albums and personal video collections in homes across the country.

Watching it from Birkhall, his Scottish home not far from Balmoral, the Prince of Wales watched the footage with fondness, not speaking about what he was watching but was clearly enjoyed it as he laughed along gently.

Frolicking around: A young Prince Charles plays without a care in the world and is seen in one of the clips jumping around in the sand dunes at Holkham Bay

Prince Charles appears to be full of beans as he lands in the sands of the dunes, falling into a heap at the bottom. Watching the footage again, the Prince laughed fondly

In another scene, pictured on 
glorious Holkham Beach in Norfolk in the summer of 1957, Prince Charles 
and his sister, Princess Anne, smile for the camera after being buried 
up to their necks by their father, the Duke of Edinburgh.

The charming picture is a still taken from home video footage shot by the Queen herself.

Charles would have been about eight at the time and Anne – who looks identical to her daughter, Zara, as a child – around six.

It has been personally chosen by the 
prince for a television tribute to his mother to mark her Diamond 
Jubilee which will be broadcast on BBC1 tomorrow night.

Sources
 close to Charles said the carefree home movie has huge personal 
resonance for both the prince and his mother and is part of hundreds of 
hours of footage shot by the Queen of her young family.

Drawing
 on these never-seen-before shots as well as archive news reels, the 
Prince reflects back on her 60-year reign – both as the nation’s Queen 
and as his own mother.

‘The Diamond Jubilee gives us the chance
 to celebrate with pride all that The Queen means to us – whether as a 
nation or as one of her children,’ he says.

Throughout
 the film, the Prince shares memories and recalls events from both her 
public and private life, adding his own commentary and insights.

Among the great public moments of the reign for which he provides additional insight is the Coronation in 1953.

In one sequence, he recalls how The Queen practised wearing the Coronation crown around Buckingham Palace – even at bathtime.

‘I
 remember my Mama coming, you know, up, when we were being bathed as 
children, wearing the crown.  It was quite funny – practising,’ he says.

In more private cine camera footage, 
taken on Coronation Day, June 2 1953, behind the scenes at Buckingham 
Palace, we see Her Majesty juggling the dual role of mother and Queen as
 she walks along the corridor of Buckingham Palace and poses for 
official photographs. 

'Amazing poise': The Queen, pictured on her Coronation tour in October 1953, is held in 'respect and affection' by leaders across the globe, Charles says

Watching
 the footage some sixty years later, the Prince comments on his mother’s
 ‘amazing poise’ and, later, her ‘natural grace’.

Although
 the prince and his mother have found themselves at odds over the years,
 with Charles accusing her of being a somewhat aloof figure, he adds: 
‘My Mama takes great pride in her family, from being a young mother at 
the start of her reign, to now being a great grandmother twice over.’

He
 demonstrates this by showing pictures to illustrate the more personal 
aspect of very public moments, such as his mother and father visiting 
him on sports day Hill House School, West London, in the summer of 1957.

In his tribute, the prince also draws extensively from news archive to remind us of key public moments such the spectacle of the Coronation, and The Queen’s many overseas tours and visits.

‘I think just the sheer number of Heads of State who are coming to the Jubilee celebrations shows the respect and affection with which my mama is held all around the world,’ he says.

‘I so admire the way she’s managed to hold that unique association – the Commonwealth – together.’

The Prince also points out that The Queen has opened Parliament in Britain 59 times, adding: ‘I’ve always thought my Mama looks absolutely wonderful in that tiara’ before noting that two of her twelve Prime Ministers were not even born when she came to the throne.

‘The fact that my Mama has been a constant feature on the scene has provided that sense, I think, of continuity in a time of immense change over 60 years,’ he says.

‘The Queen has provided an amazing record of devotion, dedication and commitment.’

A Jubilee Tribute to The Queen by The Prince of Wales will be broadcast on BBC One at 8pm on Friday 1st June 2012.
