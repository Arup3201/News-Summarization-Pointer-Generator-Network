Two sisters have sued the founders of Snapchat for using their images without permission to promote the popular app.

Sarah and Elizabeth Turner, who both live in Georgia, say cofounders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy caused them 'emotional distress, embarrassment and the loss of pecuniary value of the use of their photographs, images and likenesses’ when they led them to believe that their pictures, which they took for free in 2011, would be used for a 'class project'.

In most of the pictures, the girls - who were 18 and 19 years old at the time - are shown on the beach in bathing suits. One of the images, however, is cropped to make them appear naked, as if one sister is pulling the other one's top off, according to the lawsuit.

Faces of Snapchat! Sarah and Elizabeth Turner are suing the app, saying they were led to believe its founders were using their pictures for 'a school project' 

The girls' images have appeared on Snapchat's site as well as in the carousels that come up when you click into the app from iTunes' App Store and the Google Play Store.

Mr Spiegel also used Elizabeth's image when he was promoting the app in its early days. In a pitch to blog BroBible, he said of Elizabeth: 'The girl who modeled in our iTunes screenshots is from Duke and very good looking.' He then attached her picture to the email as 'proof.'

Now, more than three years later, the sisters claim that the app's 'tawdry reputation as being a "sexting app"' has tarnished their own personae. 

As an example, the lawsuit points out, the Turners' images appears when you type 'Snapchat slut' into Google.  

To make matters worse, their photos, they say, have helped Snapchat grow into one of the world's most popular apps. It was recently valued at $10billion - and they haven't received a penny.

Scandalous! While some of the pictures are innocent, the lawsuit points to a picture (on the right) that is cropped to make the girls appear naked

Will they get any money?Snapchat did make the sisters sign a model release form, but it said they pictures could be used for iPhones only - and Snapchat is now extremely popular on Androids 

The younger of the two sisters, Elizabeth, was first contacted in 2011 by Mr Spiegel, who was then a student at Stanford, asking her to come pose for pictures at his Pacific Palisades, California, home, according to the lawsuit.

Elizabeth, who was doing some professional modeling at the time, said she would come only if her sister Sarah could come along. 

Mr Spiegel and Mr Murphy photographed the sisters at various locations in Los Angeles. They were reportedly told that the pictures would be used for 'a school project.' 

Three days after the photo shoot, Mr Spiegel sent the Turners a Model Release form, which they both signed. In the document, Snapchat - which was then called Picaboo - was given all rights to the pictures for the purpose of promoting the app 'for iPhone.' (The app is also available on Android.) 

The document also said the Turners would not be paid for their participation - and that Snapchat would not be responsible for 'any expense or liability incurred as a result of [the girls'] participation.'

Almost twins! Sarah (left) and Elizabeth Turner (right) were 19 and 18, respectively, at the time the pictures were taken 

Intentionally deceptive? Snapchat cofounder Evan Spiegel initially contacted the Turners in 2011 

Earlier this year, Snapchat was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of deceiving customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its service.The company and the FTC were able to reach a settlement. 

Even amidst the legal troubles, Snapchat is growing rapidly: Almost a third of 18- to 24-year-olds use the app (that's more than double the amount of users the company had last November).
