Manchester City have not won a Premier League game having been behind at half-time in almost 20 years.

The shocking stat is revealed as City's title hopes lay in tatters following Monday night's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace which Manuel Pellegrini's side trailed at the interval.

The last time City managed to win having been in a losing position at half-time was on April 17, 1995 when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 having been 2-1 down at the break.

While City have spent five seasons out of the top-flight since the 1994-95 campaign - which Rovers went on to win - the stat still makes for incredible reading as the blue side of Manchester look to retain their Premier League crown and claim their third title in four seasons.

City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh.

City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone.  

Blackburn: Flowers, Kenna, Berg, Pearce, Hendry, Le Saux, Sherwood, Atkins (Batty, 78), Ripley, Sutton, Shearer.

Scorers: Shearer, 7, Hendry, 39.

Booked: Sutton, Atkins.

Manchester City: Coton, Edghill, Foster, Curle, Kernaghan, Summerbee, Flitcroft, Simpson, Rosler, Walsh (Beagrie, 78), Quinn.

Scorers: Curle (pen), 32, Rosler, 57, Walsh 71.

Booked: Kernaghan, Simpson.

While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. 

Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011.

To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. 

Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under.

Arsenal – 29/10/11 – 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3

Chelsea – 11/5/14 – 1-0 down at Cardiff at HT, won 2-1

Liverpool – 31/3/13 – 1-0 down at Aston Villa at HT, won 2-1

Manchester United – 5/10/13 – 1-0 down at Sunderland at HT, won 2-1

Tottenham  – 23/11/14 – 1-0 down at Hull at HT, won 2-1
