Harold Wilson once quipped that a week is a long time in politics.

And by that measure Russian President Vladimir Putin has been in power for an eternity.

But it seems that an eternity may not be enough for the ex-KGB premier, as he revealed he could run for a fourth presidential term in 2018.

Scroll down for video

Putin was first elected in 2000 and served two four year terms until he handed control of the country to puppet president Dmitry Medvedev who served until 2012 when Putin was reelected, this time for a six year term

If reelected the hardline ruler will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century which will make him the nation's longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin.

Putin, who served two consecutive four-year terms starting in 2000, stepped out of the presidential limelight and became prime minister in 2008 to observe a limit of two consecutive terms.

However, he maintained his grip on power from the shadows with his longtime ally, Dmitry Medvedev, serving as a placeholder.

During Putin's time in office his image has been carefully controlled leading to several bizarre PR stunts designed to show the leader as powerful and manly, including one in which he claimed to have shot a tiger

Medvedev initiated a law that extended the presidential term to six years, and Putin won a third term 2012, despite major public protests in Moscow against his rule.

While a tearful Putin took to a stage in Moscow to deliver his victory speech, allegations of vote rigging circulated with footage emerging of one man feeding voting cards into an automatic voting machine.

Putin won 62 per cent of the ballots, while his next closest rival won only 17 per cent.

If he wins the next election Putin will have been in power for 24 years, including the time served by stooge leader Dmitry Medvedev (pictured left), the same amount of time as WWII dictator Joseph Stalin (right)

Asked Thursday whether he would seek another term in 2018, Putin said that he doesn't exclude the option.

If he wins the vote, Putin will have been either in direct or indirect control of Russia for 24 years, assuming he does not run again.

Joseph Stalin, Russia's infamous Second World War dictator, became ruler of the nation in 1929 and died in the post 24 years later, in 1953.
