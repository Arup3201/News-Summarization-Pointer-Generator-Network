Convictions for benefit fraud have soared by 40 per cent in the last two years, MailOnline can reveal.

The rise follows a decision to grant new powers to investigators, allowing them to access bank account records and credit reference checks to see if someone is earning while claiming sickness benefits.

Officials can also use Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone – by discovering their partner has signed up to a sports package at the same address.

Today Michelle Taylor, 40 was convicted of claiming £21,008.54 in benefits after claiming to being unable to walk but was filmed walking to the gym. This month football manager John Alexander, 68, (right) admitted claiming nearly £7,000 for being 'unable to walk' but was caught playing and 
training with his team

Ministers yesterday warned fraudsters
 that they will ‘have to pay back their ill-gotten gains’ as the 
Department for Work and Pensions revealed that the benefits fraud bill 
topped £215million last year.

Figures showed that 9,861 benefit 
cheats were convicted in 2011-12, up by 40 per cent on the 7,040 tally 
of 2009-2010, the last full year of the Labour government.

Over the same period, around 7,000 
people a year received ‘administrative penalties’.

Almost 16,000 were 
given cautions in 2011-12, up by around 900 on 2009-10.

Welfare reform minister Lord Freud said benefit cheats will have to 'pay back their ill-gotten gains'

The sharp rise in convictions is despite  the number of cases referred to specialist teams remaining relatively stable.

The DWP said the increase in convictions was the result of a more aggressive stance and investigators having more powers.

Tackling welfare reform is one of the
 Government’s top policy priorities, and it  gave specialist teams 
permission to access private spending records.

Welfare reform minister 
Lord Freud told MailOnline: ‘Our fraud investigators now have powers to check bank accounts, satellite TV bills, and credit reference records.

'Benefit cheats who try to steal from taxpayers need to
 know our investigators are actively targeting them.

‘Our teams are actively going through
 benefit claims to spotlight potential cheats and where fraud is 
suspected we have the power to film suspects and raid people’s homes.

These cheats can end up with criminal records and will have to pay back 
their ill-gotten gains.’

The number of cases probed by the Fraud Investigation Service was 166,073 in 2011-12, up from 150,365 two years earlier.

The majority of cases are passed to customer compliance teams, to allow the FIS to ‘focus on higher risk fraud’.

The customer compliance team can cut benefits and recover overpayments, but the FIS takes serious cases to court. Some cases are so complex it can take months, and sometimes years, to result in a conviction.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has admitted fraud in the welfare system is 'rife'

The DWP yesterday highlighted the latest person to be convicted of claiming benefits while working.

Michelle Taylor, 40, of Bloxwich, 
West Midlands, was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 
months, after claiming more than £21,000 in benefits because she said 
she was unable to walk without support or a wheelchair.

Walsall magistrates heard that she was filmed walking to the gym after an anonymous tip-off to investigators.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has admitted fraud and error is ‘rife’ in the current welfare system.

He
 told the Tory party conference the next stage of his reforms would be 
the introduction of the Universal Credit - 'the most extensive shake up 
of the welfare system for years, replacing many out-of-work payments 
with a single, simple payment'.

He added: 'It will save billions in fraud and error which is rife in the existing systems.'

Earlier this month football manager John Alexander, 68, from Plymouth, admitted dishonestly failing to notify a
 change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefit between 
August 2010 and November 2011.

He
 claimed nearly 
£7,000 in benefits because he was 'virtually unable to walk' but was 
caught red-handed training his football team - jogging, kicking,
 retrieving loose balls and gesticulating from the side of a pitch.

The Department for Work and Pensions today highlighted cases it said proved new powers for investigators were working:

Steven Wiseman,
 45, of Primrose Road, Southampton, Hampshire, was sentenced last week 
to 12 months in jail for a £67,241.27 benefit fraud after claiming 
benefits while working as a van driver delivering sandwiches and rolls.

David Durrant,
 64, of Colebrook, Crediton, Devon was sentenced on October 12 to 8 
months suspended for 2 years after being found guilty of working while 
claiming £48,362.53 in benefits.

Sara Peckham,
 42, of Maclean Road, Bournemouth, was sentenced to a 12 month Community
 Order, 150 hours hours unpaid work requirement and told to pay 
compensation of £5,000 earlier this month. She claimed disability 
benefits because she could only walk short distances, but she was found 
working cleaning cars and for a train company serving customers from a 
trolley.

Sakir Kaytaz-Mehmed, 56,
 of Brantley Road, Birmingham was given six months to pay back 
£51,892.49 following a confiscation hearing on last week. In May he was 
sentenced to 8 months  after trying to hide £150,000 of savings.
