Hundreds of young American and Canadian Jews have arrived in Tel Aviv, ready to join the Israeli army despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

More than 300 Jews were flown on a specially chartered flight for Aliyah - a traditional emigration of people to Israel that dates back to Biblical times.

Of the 338 on the plane, 215 were young men, women and even children who have come to fight for the Israeli forces.

Israel is one of only three countries with mandatory military service for women. Girls can join the army aged 17

New Israeli citizens - collectively called Olim - must do a year of national service, as must any other person before they turn 25.

More than 100 children who cannot yet join Israel's Army were on the flight, but the boys can sign up when they are 18 years old and girls when they are just 17.

Israel is one of the few nations in the world that insists that young women must serve for their armed forces, with girls aged 17 to 20 expected to complete a year of national service.

Around 38 families were on board the flight that landed at Ben Gurian International Airport, nine miles from the city of Tel Aviv.

More than 8,000 North American immigrants came to Israel in the last three years, with the latest Army recruits suggesting that the conflict in Gaza has not deterred many from moving to the Middle East.

The new citizens were played a pre-recorded message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on arrival, the Jerusalem Post reported.

He said: 'When Israel is being attacked and you young Jews come to Israel, you tell our enemies that they will never succeed in bending our spirit or driving us away. You are coming to stand up for our future.'

They were greeted on the tarmac by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and interior minister Gideon Saar.

Mr Saar told the immigrants: 'Almost each of is, if he is not a new immigrant, is the son of a new immigrant. I am the son of an immigrant who came from Argentina forty nine years ago and every immigrant and their sons and daughters can reach any place in our open society.'

'Ensure the future of the people of Israel here in the land of Israel.'

People travel to Israel to Aliyah from all over the world, with slightly less than 53,000 immigrants in the last three years.

This included 12,500 from Russia and 32,400 from Europe, of which 1,561 came from the UK.

The month-long war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza has claimed the lives of more than 1,900 Palestinians, mostly civilians.

In Israel 67 have been killed, of which all but three were soldiers. 

A three-day ceasefire brokered in Egypt was holding earlier today, allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.
