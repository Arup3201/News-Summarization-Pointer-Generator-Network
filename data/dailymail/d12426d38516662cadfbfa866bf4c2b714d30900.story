The latest version of Samsung's hugely popular Galaxy S mobile phone has been spotted, according to one online site.

An image obtained by Sammobile shows the new gadget sporting a 5 inch display, and a new design with no buttons on the case.

The handset is also believed to have a quad core processor and a 13 megapixel camera.

The image that website Sammobile claims is the new Samsung Galaxy S4

'We of SamMobile just received a huge tip from our insider at Samsung and according to him this is the next generation of the Galaxy S series, the Galaxy S IV,' the site claims.

'We can’t 100% confirm if this is indeed the Galaxy S IV but the picture he sent us looks really sharp and doesn’t look fake at all'

The picture shows a new design for Samsung's flagship phone, with all of the buttons removed from the front of the device.

It is expected to run the latest version of Google's Android software.

Rumours had also circulated previously that the phone could include a radical new type of 'bendable' screen that would make the phone almost unbreakable.

However, the pictures do not appear to show anything different in the 5inch screen of the device.

It comes just hours after one online site claimed Apple's iPhone 6 was already being used in the California firm's Cupertino headquarters.

Apple and Samsung have been locked in a battle for supremacy in the smartphone market, and releasing the S4 earlir than a new iPhone could give the Korean firm a crucial advantage.

However, rival blogs have claimed the image is fake.

'It
would be easy to enlarge the screen on a SGS3 press image using 
Photoshop, remove the home button and slightly reduce the size of the 
Samsung logo at the top,' said gadget site Pocket Lint.

'Also, Samsung generally has more tricks up its sleeve than simply copying the same design year-on-year.'

Onlookers
claim that the final design may be unveiled next week the the Consumer 
Electronics show in Las Vegas - although it is possible the handset will
only be shown behind closed doors to trusted partners and accessory 
makers.

Samsung current flagship, the Galaxy S3 smartphone. A new version could be introduced next week, it has been claimed.
