Anjelica Huston has lifted the lid on a series of stormy relationships with older men including the moment she slit her wrist with a razor in rage and desperation during the stormy love affair she had with celebrity photographer Bob Richardson.

Huston was just 18 and Richardson was 42 when they first met in 1969 at a photo shoot for Harper's Bazaar as publicity for 'A Walk with Love and Death', the film she was in directed by her father.

Writing in her new memoir out today, A Story Lately Told: Coming of Age in Ireland, London and New York, the first of her two-part autobiography, she says there was an instant attraction.

Tempestuous: Huston was to meet Bob Richardson on a photo shoot for a film that she was in being directed by her father, John Huston, left. She was to have a string of high profile affairs with famous men 

Dramatic: Bob Richardson, right, would be overwhelmed by vile moods that would last days. After one episode Anjelica Huston writes how she became so distraught she slit her wrist with a razor in the bathroom

The first time they had sex they were stoned and stood in front of a mirror together so it was like an 'out-of-body experience', she writes.

Huston became his muse and inspiration but his mental health problems played havoc with their lives; he was bi-polar and suffering from schizophrenia and spent days in vile moods.

'A Story Lately Told' details how Richardson once threw a bottle of tequila at her head, tossed all her belongings around their hotel room and berated her for not being a 'real woman' because she wasn't pregnant.

Huston effectively became his lover and carer at the same time.

Huston writes: ‘I never felt so fragile or vulnerable as when Bob became demonic and flew into a rage, or worse, when afterward he retreated into his shell. 

'One morning, four days into one of these ordeals, I walked into the bathroom at the Chelsea [Hotel] and, in desperation, drew a razor blade across my left wrist. I ran back into the bedroom, blood spurting from the vein, crying to him: ‘Will this make you love me?’ 

Huston writes that Richardson took her to the emergency room where doctors stitched her wounds and asked her many questions about how she had come to have such an injury.

'Later when I told Bob I could not live like this any more, he decided we should go on vacation. We were under too much stress, he said, we needed some sun’.

They ended up going on an incident-filled trip to Mexico where they were nearly shot dead by police. 

Soon after Huston had had enough of Richardson, whose son Terry is now a famous fashion photographer in his own right - infamous for his risque pictures of stars including Madonna and Miley Cyrus.

But it wasn't the first relationship Huston had had with older men.

Huston reveals how her heart was broken for the first time as a schoolgirl of 17 by the dashing British actor James Fox, 11 years her senior, who seduced her for sex sessions during lesson time. 

The Hollywood icon fell for James Fox and skipped afternoon school to be in his arms even though he was 28 and seeing somebody else, she writes.

She was wowed by his celebrity friends who were the elite of swinging 1960s London but it ended when she realized he was in love with his girlfriend and just using her.

Huston’s
affair with Fox would mark the beginning of a string of relationships 
with A-list Hollywood men including Jack Nicholson whom she dated on and
off for 17 years until 1989, even though he repeatedly cheated on her.

She
was considered by many to be the face of the 1970s after modeling for 
Vogue in Britain and France, being shot by Helmut Newton and partying 
with celebrities like Mick Jagger.

Both Huston's parents strayed when she 
was young and Huston seems to have learned her loose attitude towards 
relationships from watching them.

Her
list of conquests is on a par with the hits of her acting career, which
includes the Addams Family and mafia satire Prizzi's Honour for which 
she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.

Iconic
photographer David Bailey fell under her spell for a time and flirted 
with the idea of proposing, she slept with Parisian aristocrat Baron 
Arnaud de Rosnay and briefly dated Ryan O'Neal before he met his 
longtime love Farrah Fawcett.

'A Story Lately Told' tells how Huston's first encounter with a celebrity admirer happened when she was just 16.

The
man in question was invited by her father, the director John Huston, to
the family estate, St Clerans in County Galway, Ireland, where she 
spent much of her youth.

At the time Huston was just 16 and 
only beginning to realise the 'power' she had over men. The admirer was 
one Marlon Brando – and he was 53.

Huston
writes: 'I went up to the Big House one morning and found a tanned, 
even-featured man in a maroon velour sweatshirt standing on the upstairs
landing, talking to Dad, who introduced me to him.

'Marlon smiled and his lips curled. He spoke through his nose.

'That
afternoon in the study, Marlon gave me a tortoise shell ring from 
Tahiti, inlaid with silver and asked me if I'd like to visit him there 
someday'.

It
would be one more year and a move to London before she met Fox, the 
star of the druggy cult drama 'Performance' alongside Jagger, and by 
then Huston had lost her virginity in a one-night-stand.

At the time Fox was 28 and was seeing
an American called Andee Cohen who Huston describes as 'like a 
Gernreich model, with a Vidal Sassoon haircut - pretty and stick thin'.

Nevertheless,
after coming to dinner with Huston's mother, the ballerina Enrica Soma,
he asked her out and sucked her into his world.

Fox
took her to his apartment in the wealthy Mayfair neighbourhood and had a
lamb stew dinner with the director Donald Cammell and his girlfriend.

Huston, who was studying for her A-Levels at the time, though they were the coolest people she'd ever met.

For
their first proper date, the book says: ‘He [Fox] had a new purple 
Lotus Elan, the colour of the red cabbage leaf he’d given as a sample 
for the custom paint job.

'As we drove out into the country, he put a tape in the machine and for the first time in my life I heard Otis Redding.’

They had lunch and then he took her back to his apartment in London where they made love. Huston writes: ‘Thus began a short series of after-school visits, none lasting longer than a few hours.'

Fox, who she called 'Willy', insisted she was his girlfriend but Huston knew better.

After seeing Fox and Cohen together looking 'very much in love', Huston 'never confronted him' about it, even when she saw them once slip off to a bedroom together.

Their affair ended but she writes that ‘Willy Fox had broken my heart’.

Huston would eventually marry sculptor Robert Graham and stayed with him until his death in 2008.
