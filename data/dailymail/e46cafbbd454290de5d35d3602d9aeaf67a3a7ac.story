A kindhearted waiter who found a wallet with $4,000 inside has been commended for chasing down its owner to hand it back.

Wilber Palicios was working at Hom Restaurant in Bayshore, Wisconsin on Friday night when he was clearing away a table and found the bulging wallet hidden beneath napkins.

By then, its owner had already left the restaurant - but Palicios didn't hesitate.

He ran out from the restaurant and saw the man climbing into his car across the parking lot.

'I saw him way over there, so I ran over there, and he was getting into his car,' the man, who is originally from Mexico, told WISN. 'I just waved at him, just show him the wallet.'

The relieved customer, who has asked not to be identified, gave the waiter an undisclosed amount as a 'thank you'. 

'I just thought it was the right thing to do,' Palicios said. 

For his honesty, his employers have also given him $250.

'And we've bought him dinner just about every night since he did it, too,' Omar Shaikh, president of Surg Restaurant Group, which owns Hom, told WISN.

When the channel asked Palicios what the extra cash meant to him, he became emotional and struggled to speak. 

'Well, I really appreciate it, so I can send it to my mom for Christmas,' he said, explaining that she and his sisters live back in Mexico. 'She really needs it.'

Customers also passed on their praise to Palicios for his noble decision.

'Wilber's mother should be very proud of him and HOM Restaurant is very lucky to have such an honest employee,' one wrote on Facebook. 'Bless him!'
