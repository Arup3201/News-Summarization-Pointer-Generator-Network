The Champions League is back with a bang this week as three Premier League sides vie for a place in the last eight of Europe’s premier club competition.

It’s extremely difficult to predict who will contest the final in Berlin on June 6 but football analysts BSports have predicted which sides will progress from the last-16 ties, which begin on Tuesday evening.

For the English sides, Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea are favourites to dump Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal can get past Monaco but BSports, the latest addition to STATS, have La Liga giants Barcelona down to beat Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City.

Here are the percentages to progress to the Champions League Last 16 from BSports

Chelsea met PSG in an enthralling quarter-final contest last season with the Londoners prevailing on the away-goals rule after a 3-3 aggregate draw, despite the French champions winning 3-1 at home in the first leg.

Having eased through their group and sitting top of the Premier League, BSports give Chelsea a 64 per cent chance of beating the Parisians to a last-eight spot.

That’s understandable as PSG are third in Ligue 1 and wasted the opportunity to leapfrog Lyon and Marseille to go top, throwing away a two-goal lead at home to Caen on Saturday.

Manchester City and Barcelona met at this point last season, with the Catalan giants prevailing 4-1 on aggregate. Pellegrini’s side have been a disappointment in Europe despite winning the 2012 and 2014 Premier League titles, hence Barcelona being awarded 66.6 per cent in favour of defeating City again.

As usual Arsenal have reached the last 16 of the Champions League and BSports sees them easing past Monaco with a 67.3 per cent chance as the French side are well off the pace in Ligue 1 in fifth place.

Reigning champions Real Madrid are given a promising 81.3 per cent chance of seeing off Roberto Di Matteo’s Schalke side but it shouldn’t be forgotten that the Italian led Chelsea to the Champions League crown in 2012.

The 2013 Champions League winners Bayern Munich are the overwhelming favourites at 92.7 per cent to bypass Shakhtar Donetsk, especially after their astonishing 8-0 rout of Hamburg on Saturday preserved their eight-point advantage at the top of the Bundesliga.

Borussia Dortmund, 2013 runners-up, are given just a 32.5 per cent chance against Juventus, who look a decent bet to land a fourth successive Serie A title.

Having spent much of the Bundesliga season rooted in the relegation zone, it’s hardly surprising Dortmund are not rated.

La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, who lost in the final last May, are set to breeze past Bayer Leverkusen, according to BSports. It's 62.7 per cent for a Spanish success.

Diego Simeone’s side take on the Germans languishing sixth in Bundesliga although they did reach the final back in 2002.

In perhaps one of the less glamorous ties, Basle take on Porto which BSports sees falling in favour of the 2004 champions from Portugal at a 78 per cent. Basle finished well behind Real Madrid in Group B but they did manage to throw Liverpool into the Europa League in the final fixture.
