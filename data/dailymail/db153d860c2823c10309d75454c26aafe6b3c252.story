Thumbs up: David Cameron said he hoped a raft of new mortgage approvals would make the dream of home ownership a reality

Tens of thousands of people who ‘haven’t got rich parents’ will have the chance to get on the property ladder from today, David Cameron declared.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to make the ‘dream of home ownership a reality’ as lenders braced themselves for a flood of interest in the £12 billion Help to Buy scheme.

But as the doors opened for homebuyers to get 95 per cent mortgages, there were fresh warnings that it risked causing an uncontrollable housing bubble.

State-backed banks Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest have announced plans to open 740 of its branches for extended hours for two weeks to cope with expected demand.

In a major boost to the government, HSBC today became the latest lender to sign up to the scheme.

Halifax and Bank of Scotland, owned by the state-backed Lloyds Banking Group, will start offering loans under the scheme on Friday.

Virgin Money and the start-up Aldermore Bank will take part from January, with some estimates suggesting 180,000 loans could eventually be taken out.

Under the scheme the house buyer must find five per cent of the property value as a deposit, the bank will provide a mortgage worth 80 per cent and the government will guarantee the remaining 15 per cent. 

New or old properties worth up to £600,000 are eligible, with both first-time buyers and people looking to move up the property ladder able to apply.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Too many hardworking people are finding it impossible to buy their own home - people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments but haven’t got rich parents and can’t pay the deposit up front.

‘There is a need for Government to act. Buying your first home is about far more than four walls to sleep at night.

‘It’s somewhere to put down roots and raise a family. It’s an investment for the future. Above all, it’s a sign that everything you’ve put in has been worth it.

‘Help to Buy is going to make the dream of home ownership a reality for many who would otherwise have been shut out. This goes right to the heart of my vision for Britain - a country where everyone who works hard can get on in life.’

First time buyers have struggled to find a deposit of at least 20 per cent

More than 25,000 people bought their first home in July this year, the highest level since November 2007

Ministers hope the scheme will trigger a new wave of housebuilding.

An
earlier phase of the scheme, offering 20 per cent loans on new-build 
properties, has already helped more than 15,000 people buy a new home 
since it was launched six months ago.

HSBC said is planning to offer Help to Buy mortgages between 90 per cent and 95 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) later this year through its branch network.

Antonio Simoes, head of HSBC UK, said it promises to beat or match rates from high street competitors at 90 per cent LTV.

'By participating in Help to Buy, we will go further and offer mortgages up to 95 per cent LTV,' he said.

Latest figures show on average first time buyers are offered only 80 per cent mortgages, requiring a deposit of more than £30,000.

But as the new scheme went live, the Treasury select committee issued a fresh warning about the impact on the housing market.

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie warned ministers had failed to ‘allay our concerns’ about the scheme.

The Tory MP added: ‘Given the chequered 
history of Government interventions in residential property, great care 
will need to be taken in both the construction and running of this 
scheme.

‘Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability.’

The committee's report concludes:

‘The primary effect of the guarantee scheme, at least in the short to medium-term, could be to raise house prices rather than stimulate new supply.

‘Furthermore, we continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted he did not think the scheme would worsen the problem of the 'overheated' property market in the capital.

But he suggested the scheme could be 'turned off' if problems emerged.

Speaking at an event in east London, he said: 'I don't believe that this second part of the Help to Buy scheme is suddenly going to make that escalation in London prices qualitatively worse, that's already happening.

'But - a big but - of course we need to be vigilant, of course we need to moderate it, even turn it off if we think that it is not appropriate and is providing inappropriate stimulation to the housing market'

The guarantees will be available for both new and existing homes worth up to £600,000, and the Treasury said there would be tough checks to ensure people could afford repayments.

Customers can get information from NatWest and RBS from today and start applying at those banks from tomorrow.

They are offering two- and five-year fixed rate deals at 4.99 per cent and 5.49 per cent interest rates with no fee.

The brands together expect to sign up 25,500 first and next time buyers over three years.

Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘If ministers are serious about helping first-time buyers, they should bring forward investment to build more affordable homes.

‘Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this Government house-building is at its lowest level since the 1920s.’
