A mother used her teenage son’s passport to fly from two UK airports.

Elaine Willis, 49, was booked on a return Flybe flight from Manchester International Airport to Edinburgh.

Mrs Willis of Stockport, Cheshire, was going through security when she realised she’d picked up her 16-year-old 
son Jamie's passport by mistake.

Remarkably, she managed to board both her flights without any issue.

A handful of airlines fly domestically, including EasyJet, Ryanair, bmibaby, British Airways and Virgin, who recently began a route between London and Edinburgh.

Many ask for photographic ID at check-in gates for commercial reasons rather than security reasons.

According to the Flybe website, a passenger must show one of the following forms of ID to fly domestically:

All passengers on Flybe international flights must be in possession of a valid passport and a valid visa if required.

According to their website, Flybe insist passengers must present one of several forms of identification to board an aircraft for domestic travel. A pension book is the only acceptable form of non-photographic ID, it adds.

Speaking today, a spokesperson from Flybe said the company require photo ID for commercial reasons and not for security.

They added there had not been a breach of security by letting Mrs Ellis on the flight.

The mother said: ‘I got to the airport early to meet up with the girls for a weekend away to Edinburgh and it was only as we went through the security that I realised I had the wrong passport.

‘I was stood in the security queue when I just thought ‘did I pick up the right passport?’

‘My face went white when I realised I only had Jamie’s passport and it went round the rest of the group like wildfire.

‘I rang my next door neighbours on each side and got one to scan over my passport as a text, but I realised he’d have no time to get it to the airport before the flight.

‘I decided not to risk telling them about the mix up and there was lots of angst on my part.

‘But I couldn’t believe it when they let me through - none of us thought for a minute that I would get through on a young boy’s passport. The checks were clearly very poor.

‘Once I got on the flight my neighbour passed my passport on to a teacher friend Alma Bell, who was flying up later in the day.

‘I thought then that I wouldn’t have a problem getting back, but on the return the girls suggested I see if it could happen twice.'

A few days later, Mrs Willis attempted to return to Manchester using her son's passport.

She said: ‘Amazingly on the Sunday out of Edinburgh exactly the same happened - nobody noticed that it wasn’t my passport.

‘It was even more unbelievable that I could do the same thing on the way back. It was absolutely astonishing.

‘In
 the light of what has happened to the Malaysian Airlines it is clear 
that security checks at airports have become much more lax and people 
making the checks must be much more careful for the sake of everyone’s 
safety.

Mrs Willis with the passport. Flybe insist on photographic ID for domestic travel - with a pension book being the only acceptable form of non-photographic ID

‘Mine was an entirely innocent mistake with no bad intent at all, but we all know that there are people out there who want to bring terror to the skies above Britain, Europe and the USA and they need to be caught before any more people die.’

A spokesman for Flybe said: 'Flybe can confirm that there is no requirement for passengers to be in possession of a passport or any other form of photographic ID to fly domestically within the UK.

'Despite this however, Flybe does have a policy to determine for its own purposes, a passenger’s identity.

'Other methods can be, and are, used to satisfy this requirement and enable them to travel and we will be taking up the matter of Mrs Willis’ travel with our airports and our third-party check-in agents.'

A spokesman for Manchester International Airport said: ‘It isn’t airport staff who check passports. It is down to the airline and depends on Flybe policy.

‘She was flying within the UK, but people returning from overseas it is the Border Agency that checks passports.’

A spokesman from Edinburgh Airport said: 'There are no legal obligations for a passenger to carry their passport when flying within the UK. 

'When flying domestically, each airline specifies its own identification requirements.'
