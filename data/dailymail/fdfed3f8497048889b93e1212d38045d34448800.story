A Perth man has been left baffled after being handed a contract detailing extensive rules for living in the share house he rents with two other people, leaving friends comparing the strict agreement to the Big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper.

The 28-year-old was searching for a new home in Perth when he stumbled across an ad for a share house on a Gumtree, and agreed to move into the residence without meeting the people he would be sharing with.

After living in the house for four months, he was presented with a two-page contract to sign by his female housemate, full of rules and regulations which included using headphones 'when watching tv for a long period of time', and no noise after 10pm.

'While I was aware that she had been planning to draft a house agreement, I had no idea that it would be this full on. When I got it I was so taken a back at how intense it was,' he said.

A Perth man has been left baffled after being handed a contract detailing strict and extensive rules for living in the share house he rents with two other people

The contract states that the extensive list has been constructed in order that 'housemates can get on with enjoying peaceful lives', and that rules allows 'clear expectations' so that 'misunderstandings are minimised'.

'I've been living there for four months, and knew that she was very clean. I could tell from her emails even before I moved in, so I guess I knew what I was getting myself into, but at the same time I couldn't believe that she felt she needed to do this,' he said. 

'It's not even her house, it's a share property. She's on the lease, which is why she probably feels like she can say 'this is how it's going to be if you want to live here,' he said. 

Doors are always to be 'closed gently', especially before 6am after 10pm, as 'the living area is a large open space where all sound is transmitted easily'.

One Facebook user asked 'Are you living with Sheldon Cooper?', in reference to the Big Bang Theory's 'roommate agreement'

One Facebook user asked 'Are you living with Sheldon Cooper? Did he sign the roommate agreement?

'Obviously over time little things can annoy people, but I thought we had a pretty good working relationship. The other girl we live with moved in about two months ago, and for some reason she decided to let us both know how it was going to be,' he said.

'It wasn't even just being given the contract, but she felt she had to explain it to me. We must have spent 45 minutes going through it line by line, she elaborated on everything in detail,' he said. 

After receiving the contract, he showed the the document to his brother, who took to social media to poke fun at the extensively detailed list.

Photos of the contract to Facebook with the caption 'You think your housemates are bad?', sparking outrage and satirical comments from his friends.

One Facebook user asked 'Are you living with Sheldon Cooper? Did he sign the roommate agreement?', in reference to the Big Bang Theory episode where two of the sitcoms flatmates sign a document when they first move in together.

The Roommate Agreement has multiple sections with bizarre clauses that uptight character Sheldon Cooper uses to his advantage throughout the series. 

The rules include wiping the bench after every use, emptying the sink strainer every time food is collected, and the use of headphones for watching television for extended stretches of time, unless 'negotiated' otherwise. 

'I knew she was clean, so I really did my best to mirror that. Obviously things will build up over time but this has been taken to the next level,' he said. 

Several commentators labelled the rules 'outrageous', 'intense', 'extreme', and 'hilarious'.

According the house rules, no friends were allowed to sleep on the property's couches, and parties must end at midnight.

If parties did take place, all the cleaning up must be completed by the next day, and dishes were to be put in the dishwasher 'immediately' after being used.

There are no drugs allowed ever, 'anyone, anytime', the list states. 

The rules also stated that while recycling would not be 'enforced', if potential housemates were confused as to what items were recyclable, there was a list on the bin to aid them in their pursuit.

One social media user poked fun at the vacuum having a name, with the rules stating 'run Thomas' when the floor needs to be cleaned.

'I thought Thomas must have been their slave', joked one Facebook user.

The Perth man said that Thomas was quite a presence in the house, and had even been mentioned in the Gumtree ad for the property.

The rules also go beyond housekeeping, and include a section of 'mechanism for keeping peace'.

One of the rules state, 'before bringing something up, consider whether it was an isolated incident or an ongoing issue; and consider the level of impact of the situation on all housemates/neighbours'.

Notes alerting other housemates to an issue are strictly banned, with all communication to be done face to face, or during a house meeting.

A 'proactive, problem-solving approach' with 'mutually agreeable outcomes' are desired.

At the end of the rules the writer states that if differences of opinion can't be settled, it may 'signal that people might be better off and happier living with like-minded others'.

The 28-year-old said that this might end up being the case, and that he now feels like he's 'done his run'. 

'Now that she's given us the rules, things have definitely changed. I got a text last night from her because I was watching TV past 10pm, which said 'it's bedtime',' he said. 

'It's just such a strange situation, really crazy. I've tried my hardest to accommodate her, but I think I'm done.'
