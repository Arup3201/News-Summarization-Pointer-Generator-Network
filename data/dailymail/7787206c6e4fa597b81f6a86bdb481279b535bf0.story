Wayne Rooney has the perfect retreat should he ever doubt his own achievements. It is a place in his home: a personal mini-museum, spread over two floors.

By any standard his career has been fruitful and today he will receive a new centrepiece for his exhibition: a Golden Cap set in a glass case to mark his 100 appearances for England.

At 29, he is the youngest footballer to reach the landmark.

Apart from the embroidered England crest, Rooney's golden cap is entirely hand-made by Toye, Kenning & Spencer.

Based in Warwickshire, the company is the world's oldest fraternal regalia maker and has been in operation for more than three centuries.

The company is also responsible for the ribbons that adorn the FA Cup.

'I'll put it in there, with the other things I've collected over the years,' said Rooney. 'The first things you see when you go in are my Premier League medals.

'It's something I'm very proud of. They're on a mannequin in a Manchester United shirt. There's a glass cabinet underneath with all my England caps in.'

Here is a rare glimpse into Wayne's World.

'It's probably about the size of this room, split between upstairs and downstairs,' he adds, glancing around a large conference room inside St George's Park, where he is being mined for memories before becoming England's ninth centurion.

And there is still time for him to surpass the 125 caps of Peter Shilton and the 49 goals of Sir Bobby Charlton, who will make Saturday's presentation.

He stands just six goals behind Charlton and there is no sign of him stopping. Rooney wants to play at a fourth World Cup, in Russia in 2018, and yet he might have quit football at the age of 14, had it not been for Everton coach Colin Harvey.

THE HIGH - Euro 2004

'It was such a great experience for me to go there at such a young age and start all the games and score four goals.'

THE LOW - Red card v Portugal (World Cup QF 2006)

'I believe to this day if I'd stayed on we would've won the game. Unfortunately we didn't go through and that made it worse for me. You start thinking, is it my fault?'

TOP THREE GOALS 

'My first goal against Macedonia (September 6, 2003), although the keeper should have saved it. I don't know what he was doing! The goal against Croatia (June 21, 2004) when I played a one-two with Michael Owen. I really enjoyed that goal. And the header against Switzerland (June 17, 2004) in the Euro 2004 finals. My first tournament goal. It means a lot more to score for your country in competitive games.'

BIGGEST REGRET - Algeria 0-0 in Cape Town and X-rated verdict on England fans via a TV camera

'No matter what people might say, we as a group of players care about playing for England. When things aren't going right on the pitch, it's frustrating because we know we can do better. Sometimes it boils over, and that's what happened. It's certainly something I regret.'

FUNNIEST MOMENT 

'One of the masseurs put a lot of work into a game of 'Deal or No Deal' for us in South Africa, and drew David James to play. At the first offer he took the deal and completely ruined the game.'

BEST ENGLAND BOSS 

'Certainly my best time has been under Roy Hodgson. My goalscoring is the best it's been for England. Sven was great. He really trusted his players and gave us freedom. It was difficult under Steve McClaren as the team weren't doing well. Under Capello it was quite tough in a different way. He tried to bring something different to what we normally had.'

MARK OUT OF 10 

'I can't say it is three or eight. You have to really look at how successful you have been and we haven't been successful. That's how teams and players get rated. I'd say it hasn't always been great but it's always been magical to play for my country.'

'I stopped enjoying it,' said Rooney. 'It was really down to Colin Harvey that I carried on.

'He sat me down and made me fall back in love with it.

'He just said he hadn't seen any player with the talent I had and that I'd be making a mistake.

'I thought, "he used to be Everton manager, so he knows the game". Thankfully I listened. That's when I stopped going to boxing and focused solely on football. It was the right decision.'

Three years later came an England debut, starting the second half in a side captained by Danny Mills after Sven Goran Eriksson made 11 half-time substitutions in a friendly against Australia.

Rooney was up front with Everton pal Francis Jeffers, cheered on by friends and family of the Croxteth pair who put on a special coach to Upton Park.

Jeffers scored and never played for England again. Rooney knows his life could have turned out very differently. He might have ended up in landscaping or building like his mates.

As it is, he will lead out England at Wembley with sons Kai and Klay, before today's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia.

'I hope this isn't my last tournament,' Rooney said. 'It's difficult when you're coming up to 30 to start planning the next four years.

'You have to be realistic. There's a chance I might not go to the next World Cup but it's something I'd love to do. I never want to cut my career short by deciding not to play for England.'

Tournaments have not been kind to Rooney. His fondest England memories are from Euro 2004, even though it ended prematurely with a broken metatarsal. His favourite goals are a decade in the past. It is indicative of the era.

Steven Gerrard reached back to the 5-1 win in Germany, his sixth cap. Frank Lampard, like Rooney, cherished Euro 2004. For those representing England over the past 10 years, it has been about regrets and missed opportunities.

Amid untimely injuries, red cards and red mists, one moment stands out: his dismissal against Portugal in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final. 'That's the low,' said Rooney. 'I believe to this day if I'd stayed on we would've won the game.

'I beat myself up about it straight away. I was in the dressing room watching the rest of the game. It was difficult, knowing no matter what happened my tournament was over.

'We didn't go through and that made it worse. You start thinking, 'Is it my fault?' We've been stuck, we can't get past the quarter-finals and that was a great opportunity, like Euro 2004 was.

'Not going through, and knowing my red card might have affected that, was difficult to take. I didn't show it too much. I tend to keep things like that inside.'

The Manchester United narrative took over. Rooney's red card was for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho, but a wink from Cristiano Ronaldo came to signify a Portuguese plot to wind up England's best player until he blew.

'I spoke to him (Ronaldo) straight after the game,' said Rooney, 'because I knew which way the press would go in terms of us falling out. We had to make sure that didn't happen for Manchester United's sake.

'There was never an issue. I understood why he'd done it. He was trying to win for Portugal and to be honest I'd probably do the same for England. I remember saying to the referee that he was diving, trying to get him a yellow card.

'It happens in football.'

Roy Hodgson insists the best is still to come for his captain of the next generation — and Rooney agrees things are moving in the right direction, but 99 England caps breed caution. There are no guarantees.

Given the choice, he would have preferred a World Cup medal to a 'Golden Cap'. Wouldn't they all? On Saturday, he can savour his experiences and his goals and be thankful he didn't pack it all in 15 years ago.

'I'm blessed with the career I've been able to have,' said Rooney. 'There have been tough times on and off the field, but I've never thought this isn't what I want to be doing. I've always believed this is the perfect thing for me.'
