A second man has been arrested in connection with gun and grenade attacks which killed a grieving father weeks after his son was shot dead.

David Short, 46, suffered a barrage of bullet and blast injuries in the attack in Clayton, Manchester, on Friday morning. It took place after his son Mark, 23, was shot dead as a gunman opened fire in a pub in the city in May.

Greater Manchester Police said a 37-year-old man was arrested last night on suspicion of murder in connection with Friday's attack in Clayton and a second gun and grenade attack which took place minutes later in Droylsden.

The force is continuing to search for one-eyed suspect Dale Cregan, 29, for questioning over the two incidents.

Cregan is also wanted in connection with the murder of Mark Short. Today a third man was charged with the murder of the amateur.

The father-of-one from Manchester, was shot in the neck at the Cotton Tree Pub in the Droylsden area of the city on May 25 after a gunman walked in and opened fire.

Three other men were also shot during the attack and suffered leg and back injuries.

Tonight, Mathew James, 32, from Clayton, Manchester, was charged with one count of murder and three counts of attempt murder, Greater Manchester Police said.

He will appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning.

Two other men, Luke Livesey, 27, from Hattersley, and Damien Gorman, 38, from Glossop, were charged with Mr Short's murder and three counts of attempted murder last week.

Mr Short's father, David, 46, who had branded his son's murderers "cowards", was killed on Friday during a gun and grenade attack on a house in Clayton.

Armed police have staged high visibility patrols in the Clayton and Droylsden areas since the attacks took place.

GMP Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, said: 'We have dedicated a significant amount of officers to not only identify those involved in the violent attacks which have left one man dead, but also to carry out intensive patrols in the area to reassure people living there.

'We have made significant advances in the police investigation over the past couple of days, and a man was arrested last night in the Salford area.

'Our inquiries are still very much ongoing and our main priority continues to be finding Dale Cregan, so we can arrest him and speak to him about these incidents. We are appealing to the public to help us to do this.

'We have released two images of Cregan and are urging anyone who has seen him or who knows of his whereabouts, to please call us immediately. Do not approach him.

'We have specialist officers who continue to support the family of David Short at this difficult time and extra police officers, including specialist firearms officers, remain on patrol in the Clayton and Droylsden areas.'

Emergency services, including an Army bomb disposal unit were deployed to two addresses near Manchester after shootings were reported this morning

Police have cordoned off houses at the scenes of both shootings, and some homes have been evacuated due to a gas leak

A Home Office post mortem examination concluded that Mr Short died from multiple gun shot wounds and explosion injury.

GMP said an explosion which also took place at the house was caused by a grenade.

Nine minutes later the force received 
reports that shots had been fired at a second property where detectives say there was also a grenade blast.

Nobody 
was injured in the second incident.

Father-of-one Mark Short, an amateur 
boxer, was shot in the neck at the Cotton Tree Pub in Droylsden on May 
25 after a gunman walked in and opened fire.

Three other men were also shot in the pub and received leg and back injuries.

A 31-year-old man was taken into custody yesterday after being arrested at a hospital last week in connection with his murder.

The man, who was arrested at 
Wythenshawe Hospital on Wednesday, remains in police custody on 
suspicion of one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder.

Luke Livesey, 27, from Hattersley, and
Damien Gorman, 38, from Glossop, were charged with Mark Short's murder 
and three counts of attempted murder on Wednesday.

'I want to reiterate that while these 
attacks are highly unusual and we do not believe there is any threat to 
the wider public, we understand that recent events may have left people 
feeling worried.

'Neither the police nor the community 
will stand for such acts of violence and I am asking for people to work 
with police to share any information they may know. This can be done in 
complete confidence if necessary.'

After his son was murdered, David Short and his family released a statement saying he had been 'taken away from us by cowards'.

His body was found when police 
responded to reports of gunfire at an address in Folkestone Road East, 
Clayton, at around 10.30am on Friday.

David - known as 'Pops' - and Mark's mother Michelle had publicly condemned their son’s killers as 'cowards' and and told how memories of him 'would live in their hearts forever'.

In a statement at the time of his death Mark’s grieving family said: 'Mark was taken away from us by cowards.

Nearby houses have also been evacuated due to a gas leak apparently caused by the shots

'People who knew Mark, knew him as a 
young man with a big heart. He would not think twice about helping his 
family and friends when they were in need.
'He was no angel and it is not a secret he had been in trouble with the 
police, but that was all in the past. He was a loving son, brother, 
father and boyfriend to Naomi.

'Mark was only 23-years-old and 
looking forward to a future with his son, Mark Junior. This has now all 
been taken away from him. He will be deeply missed by all of his family 
and friends the only ones that knew him the most.

'His memory will be love in our hearts forever.'

Neighbours of Mr Short said a large 
silver car had been spotted parked near the family house on Thursday 
morning with four men inside amid fears they were 'scouting' out the 
property.

One neighbour said: 'I was in bed and
woke up to the sound of gun shots. I could just tell from the sound of 
them that they were gun shots.

'It’s normally okay round here so it a
real shock. We’re being told that there’s now a gas leak and everyone 
has been evacuated from their homes. I think when they opened fire they 
must had hit a gas pipe or something.'

Another neighbour added: 'I was going
for a paper when I heard five or six loud bangs. Someone said to me, 
"They’re not fireworks"'.

The gunmen were seen running from the house after neighbours heard shots.

One said: ‘There were between five 
and eight shots fired – the last couple were really loud. I looked out 
of my window and saw two men running off  - all masked up.'

A white transit van, which is believed to have been involved in both attacks was seized at the scene of the second blast.

A silver Ford Fiesta was later seized 
nearby in Failsworth. Both vehicles were checked by Army bomb disposal 
experts to ensure they were safe for police to recover them.
