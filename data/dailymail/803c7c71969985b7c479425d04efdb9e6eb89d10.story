Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has revealed his time in charge at Old Trafford will be his last in football.

Van Gaal and his players head to Liverpool on Sunday in an attempt to solidify their current position in the top four of the Barclays Premier League.

And the Dutchman has revealed his attempt to bring glory back to United will be his final challenge in the game.

Louis van Gaal has announced Manchester United will be his last job before he retires from the game

Van Gaal told The Telegraph: 'I am old. This is my last job. For sure.

'I have to pay attention to my kids, my grandchildren but also to my wife. They deserve it. Now I cannot pay that attention. I was not at the birthday of my grandson for example. I don't like it.

'We have to qualify for the Champions League and we have many tests next year. That also develops the level of your team, and of course how many players can come in to improve our selection.' 

Van Gaal has not had everything his own way in his first season in English football but already believes he has identified two future managers in his squad. 

The former Ajax boss won the European Cup with the Dutch giants against AC Milan back in 1995

'Wayne Rooney is very open to learn,' he said.

'It's amazing. I don't know if he speaks with his wife Coleen about football, I don't think so.

'But we have the process of talking here. Most of my players of my selection are open and that's very nice.

'Michael Carrick is more or less a trainer-coach. He is also willing to talk about shapes and systems.

'That's nice. Rooney also. Not every player is very open and then you have to convince him, and then you get a struggle. It works or it doesn't work. Give them time. Also give me time to do it.

'I am the most flexible manager you can imagine. When the players are coming with good arguments, I change my opinion.' 

United head to Anfield on Sunday having finally abandoned the three-man defensive system that attracted so much debate earlier in the season.

Despite using it all through pre-season and in to the competitive campaign, Van Gaal now claims he has settled on a more effective shape.

'I ask also the players which system they want to play,' Van Gaal revealed.

'And then I ask individual players: 'What's your favourite position?' 'First they don't want to answer but now they are more open, and they answer.

'The fans are shouting it (4-4-2). I have played it but that was to do with accidental circumstances. The system we play now is the system that I prefer, that I have played everywhere. The system against Tottenham last weekend is my preferred system.

'When it is needed, then I play with five at the back. Tottenham was 4-3-3 when we had the ball. When we defend it was more 4-1-4-1 yesterday. The next game is different.'
