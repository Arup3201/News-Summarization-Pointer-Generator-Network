Iain Duncan Smith demanded new rights for Britain to restrict handouts to EU migrants in Berlin today

Iain Duncan Smith opened up a new front in the Tory battle with Brussels last night, demanding new rights for Britain to restrict welfare handouts for EU migrants.

The Work and Pensions Secretary made a provocative speech in Berlin in which he hit out at the European Commission for telling us ‘we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from Europe, regardless of their circumstances’, and that doing otherwise is ‘akin to xenophobia’.

He said the Government had already banned new migrants from claiming housing benefit and stopped them from getting unemployment or family support until they have been living in the UK for at least three months.

Migrants without work are also now required to prove they can speak English and that they will be able to get a job in order to claim.

But Mr Duncan Smith said Britain wanted to go further, and demanded ‘the right to say to migrants that we require a much longer record of commitment before you get benefits and shortening the duration of any benefit claim that is allowed’.

He condemned EU interference in the UK welfare system as ‘unwarranted and unwanted’ and said it should abandon its efforts to hold up a series of further welfare reforms he would like to make with a ‘constant stream’ of legal challenges.

Meanwhile Brussels officials came under attack from senior Tories – even europhile Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg – for ‘lecturing’ Britain on its economic policy, despite growth here far outpacing that of struggling eurozone countries.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said the European Commission could ‘take a running jump’ over one proposal for the UK to impose higher property taxes on owners of expensive homes.

Mr Clegg said Brussels should concentrate on cutting red tape and regulation for businesses, rather than delivering ‘lectures’ to the UK.

Mr Duncan Smith insisted Britain ‘strongly believes that the European Union must change’.

He said the Government wanted to end the 
‘absurdity of paying family benefits to workers who have moved country, 
yet whose children remain back at home, at a rate that bears little 
relation to the level of benefits in the country where the children 
actually live’.

And he complained that the  EU ‘wrongly cites the freedom of movement as a justification for interfering with our national welfare system,  telling us we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from Europe, regardless of their circumstances… and that to do otherwise is ... akin to “xenophobia”.

He added: ‘If we fail to change ...  then we run the risk of damaging the reputation of free movement altogether.’

German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly asked the French government if it would put forward Christine Lagarde – who is currently head of the IMF – to be the next president of the European Commission.

The appointment would be seen as a great victory for No 10 in its efforts to prevent so-called ‘Mr Euro’ Jean-Claude Juncker from getting the job.

Britons pay higher property taxes than people living in any other developed country, according to new figures.

Property taxes in the UK represent 4.2 per cent of the country’s total economic output, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed.

The average in the OECD is 1.8 per cent.

The revelation makes a mockery of European Commission calls for new property and land levies to hit more expensive homes in Britain.

The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The housing market is already over-taxed. The answer is planning reform, not headline-grabbing wealth taxes.’
