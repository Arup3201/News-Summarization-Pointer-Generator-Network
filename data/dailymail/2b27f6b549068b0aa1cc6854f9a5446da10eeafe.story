Charged: Brian Weyhenmeyer, 32, is charged with killing his wife by driving over her repeatedly, police said

Detectives arrested Mr Weyhenmeyer at the couple's home the next day after claiming to find blood on the wheels and bumper of his Ford Edge car.

He was taken to a hospital for a medical evaluation after telling officers he had 'medical conditions', but Charles County police spokesman Diane Richardson refused to say why, NBC reported.

Last night, he was released from the hospital  and taken to the Charles County detention center, where he was charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, first-degree assault and second-degree assault.

Investigators have urged anyone with information about the incident to contact the sheriff's office.

The investigation is ongoing.
