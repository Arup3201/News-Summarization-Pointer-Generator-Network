Many adults now avoid many foods, believing themselves to be intolerant or allergic  

Eating with a group of friends can nowadays be fraught with the difficulties, as more and more people claim to be prey to  food allergies, intolerances and diet specifications.

This isn't surprising, given that more than one in five adults is avoiding certain foods because of an allergy or intolerance - even if many of them only think they have it, according to new research.

But genuine or not, it means up to a third of households have had to adapt mealtimes to cope with a member of the family who cannot or does not eat certain foods.

And that has led to a 'phenomenal' growth for the industry providing foods free from gluten, lactose, nuts or a host of other ingredients affecting millions of Britons.

A survey for trade body, the Food and Drink Innovation Nework, found 22 per cent of adults said they had either an allergy or intolerance to certain foods or drink.

The poll of 1,600 adults did not ask for proof, so it is entirely possible that many may have wrongly linked health or digestion problems to particular types of food that they now avoid.

Dairy and gluten are the most popular types of food to be given up by those who believe they have an allergy or intolerance, said the industry body.

The survey was commissioned ahead of a summit on the 'Free From' industry next week in London.

It found twice as many women as men say they have an allergy or intolerance.

A spokesman said: 'The incidence of food allergy and intolerance is higher in the south of England than around the rest of the UK.

'But the spread across the classes is fairly even.'

New EU regulations mean any restaurant, pub or other catering service must, from December, list all potential allergens in the ingredients for all meals and products.

The research added these will have a 'dramatic effect on the catering and food service industry.'
