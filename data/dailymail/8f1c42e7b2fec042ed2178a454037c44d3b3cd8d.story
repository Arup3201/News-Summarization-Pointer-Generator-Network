Banksy has unveiled one of his most politically charged installations to date, which features a 1-800 number to a recording of a U.S. airstrike in 2007 that killed two children and a Reuters journalist. 

The work in New York is Banksy's comment on the Iraq war and shows a spray-painted car set in front of charging horses wearing night-vision goggles.

The car, on the lower East Side, is surrounded with oil barrels and Banksy has stenciled a number on the side of one.

The Banksy installation in New York's Lower East Side has been hailed as some of his most political work to date

A 1800 number stencilled on an oil barrel next to a spray-painted car takes the caller to a 39-minute recording of a 2007 air strike in Baghdad 

The political installation has been cordoned off behind a chain link fence that is part of a month-long New York street art residency

The phone number takes callers to a disturbing 39-minute recording of an airstrike in Baghdad that was released by Wikileaks in 2010.

Eighteen people, including a Reuters photographer and two children, were killed in the strike.

The clip ends after an Apache helicopter crew is told that children have been hurt in the gun strike and are being rushed to hospital.

A soldier is then heard saying: 'Well, it's their fault for bringing kids into battle.'

Another soldier is also heard saying 'Think I just ran over a guy', followed by a burst of laughter.

Hundreds of peole have already visited the site of the work since it was unveiled in Ludlow Street.

It is part of Banksy's project, Better Out Than In: An Artists Residency On The Streets Of New York.

Hundreds of people have flocked to see Banksy's latest installation, called Crazy Horses Riding Through the Lower East Side to a WikiLeaks Soundtrack

The installation features two spray painted vehicles, including depictions of men staring up at the horses with gun cross hairs pointing at them

The month long project began with photographs of Banksy’s work on the website BanksyNY.com.

‘The plan is to live here, react to things, see the sights - and paint on them,’ Banksy told the Village Voice in an email. ‘Some of it will be pretty elaborate, and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall.’

Starting on October 1, Banksy has used his stenciling technique to turn New York City buildings into his canvas.

Naughty paperboys, a dog peeing on a fire hydrant, and a Band-Aid covered balloon have now appeared in Manhattan and Brooklyn - or did until they were quickly painted over.

Banksy said in an email interview that some of his work during the residency will be 'pretty elaborate' while others 'will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall

The installation called Crazy Horses Riding Through the Lower East Side to a WikiLeaks Soundtrack is the largest of the residency so far.

Fan Phillip Schoultz told New York Daily News: 'I thought someone was playing Call of Duty at first and then I realized.

'It's definitely one of his more serious pieces.'

The eye-catching work comes after the reclusive Bristol-born tagger was apparently caught on camera for the first time.

A man in a flat cap and paint-spattered overalls was photographed trying to fix a 'moving painting' in a van which had broken down, as part of the artist's month-long 'exhibition' in the U.S.

The artist's real name is thought to be either Robin Banks or Robin Gunningham, but all that is known for sure is that he is from Bristol.

Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007.
