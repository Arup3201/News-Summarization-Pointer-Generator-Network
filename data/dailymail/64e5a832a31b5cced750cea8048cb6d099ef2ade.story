David Cameron warned restive Tory MPs he will not change policy on an EU  referendum yesterday – but promised there would be no more divisive issues such as gay marriage.

Seeking to draw a line under a turbulent fortnight, the Prime Minister said his party could now rally behind his pledge to give voters an in/out choice on British membership of the EU by 2017, following an attempt to claw back key powers.

He warned Eurosceptics who may seek further concessions: ‘It’s a very clear, very decisive policy.‘[It] doesn’t matter the pressure I come under from outside the Conservative Party or in Europe or inside the Conservative Party – this policy is not going to change.

Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron has told Tory rebels he will not bring the proposed referendum on Europe forward

‘The question is not going  to change. The number of referenda isn’t going to change. The date by which we hold this referendum isn’t going to change. It’s the right policy for the country.’

Mr Cameron insisted there was ‘unity’ on the Tory benches over the need to hold an in/out referendum and there had simply been ‘a disagreement over the last couple of weeks about an issue we actually agree about’.

He said the referendum pledge was the ‘boldest, clearest, most straightforward policy on Europe that any party leader has had for 30 or 40 years’.

Divisive issue: The vote over gay marriage has split the Tory party

‘It’s that sort of leadership, that sort of clarity, that is required.’

But following splits in his party over same-sex marriage, approved by MPs earlier this week, the Prime Minister attempted to reassure backbenchers that it would not be the ‘first of many other issues like that’.

He insisted the Government would focus on the economy, welfare reforms and education in the run-up to the 2015 general election.

Mr Cameron admitted that the gay marriage issue ‘divides’ his party but added: ‘There will be young boys in schools today who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest Parliament in the land has said that their love is worth the same as anyone else’s love and that we believe in equality.

‘And I think they’ll stand that bit taller today and I’m proud of the fact that has happened.

‘But if you’re saying to me, “Is the first now of many other issues like that?” No, it isn’t. The Government now is going to be absolutely focused on the big picture, which is fixing our economy, reforming welfare, making sure there are good schools for our children to go to.’

As rows over Europe and gay marriage raged, the Prime Minister cancelled two political Cabinet meetings in a row and failed to meet any member of the backbench 1922 Committee executive.

One Number 10 source admitted that their operation had been ‘arrogant and incompetent’, while a Cabinet minister said that Mr Cameron’s handling of the past few weeks ‘has more than a hint of the John Majors’.

Some of Mr Cameron’s allies are angry with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who has fanned the flames of revolts over Europe and gay marriage, with some suspecting he is trying to position himself as a successor to the Prime Minister.

Sir Christopher Meyer, who served as Sir John Major’s spokesman between 1994 and 1996, said Mr Cameron was being harried by  ‘latter-day bastards’ in the Tory party. That was a reference to Sir John’s unguarded remark about the ‘bastards’ causing trouble over Europe in his own Cabinet.

‘He should be in a better position vis-a-vis his own party. Cameron polls ahead of his party and there is no other obvious contender for the leadership,’ Sir Christopher told the Huffpost.

‘You do have a situation again where a large chunk of the Conservative Party is having a nervous breakdown over Europe and getting out of Downing Street’s control.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused senior Tories of briefing against him by predicting that he would be ousted by Business Secretary Vince Cable, accusing them of distracting attention from their

‘internal woes’. He said: ‘Anyone who is spending time war-gaming about what may or may not happen to me is wasting their time. I’m going to be leader of this party up to and through the next general election.’
