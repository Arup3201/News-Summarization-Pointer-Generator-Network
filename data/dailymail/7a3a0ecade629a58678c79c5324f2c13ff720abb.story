The main attractions at most zoos are lions, tigers and other endangered animals.

Not so in North Korea.

State media revealed today the Central Zoo in Pyongyang has unveiled its latest draw - a pack of Yorkshire Terriers.

Korea Central News Agency said the miniature dogs have been introduced and are learning 'several feats' to perform for visitors.

In a statement on agency's website, it said: 'Recently, Yorkshire terriers were sent to the Central Zoo in the DPRK.

'Each one has long hair tan on its head and legs and blue grey on its body. It is 22-24cm tall and weighs 2.5-3.5kg.

'It lives about 14 years on an average. Now they are learning several feats in the zoo.'

Most North Koreans will be unfamiliar with 'Yorkies'.

The dogs were originally bred in Yorkshire to catch rats and mice by scuttling around clothing mills. A picture released by KCNA appeared to show three Yorkshire Terriers in seemingly good condition.

North Korea's Pyongyang Central Zoo is located in suburban 
Pyongyang and has a large collection of more than 5,000 animals. It was 
built in 1959 under the orders of dictator Kim Il-Sung.

However, like the rest of country ruled by Kim Jong-Un it is believed to be a grim place to live.

In a 2006 report by the Asia Times described a movie shot in the country called 'Fighting Animals', which purported to be a wildlife documentary but actually showed caged animals - even some endangered species - fighting to the death.

Since many of the animals in the video can only be found in the Pyongyang Zoo, it seems likely zookeepers were involved in the film's production.

Central Zoo has also been condemned by travel publication Lonely Planet, whose website claims most of the animals kept there 'look pretty forlorn'.

It said: 'Worst off are the big cats, nearly all gifts of long-dead communist big wigs around the world - the wonderful lions, tigers and leopards are kept in woefully inadequate compounds, and many have lost the plot as a result.'

'The zoo's two elephants and its hippo all look exceptionally lacklustre as well.'

In December 2012 footage was uploaded to YouTube by documentary maker Alun Hill appeared to show bears and elephants trudging around largely concrete enclosures, and tigers staring at visitors from behind bars.

According to the video, the zoo houses 650 different species in 60 animal shed and aquariums.
