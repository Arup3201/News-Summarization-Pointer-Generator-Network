Actually, he didn’t rant or rave. Jose Mourinho made his points lucidly and, for the most part, logically. A little whiny, perhaps.

For that alone, there should be no question of further action from the Football Association over his impromptu guest spot on Sunday.

Calling a referee a cheat is actionable, but Mourinho took care to be respectful. His belief that Chelsea alone are suffering from official incompetence also does his cause few favours, and his memory is as selective as any manager (he forgot Gary Cahill’s dive against Hull City, for instance).

Yet the crux of the debate — why violent, career-threatening tackles seem to be less of an issue in English football than a dozen or so matters of little consequence, is a debate that needs to take place, and urgently.

Our referees are well equipped to spot when a player has celebrated inappropriately, minus shirt. When one has come in late, over the top and with malicious intent, they too often seem baffled, or at least underwhelmed.

Nobody is under any illusion about Mourinho’s motives. He did not commandeer television airtime to protest on behalf of Manchester City. We know precisely who will benefit if referees can be pressured into avoiding controversy around Chelsea players.

Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final

If Atkinson can not tell that Barnes' tackle was violent, maybe he should take some time away from the game

A refereeing performance in a Southern Mediterranean or South American country like Martin Atkinson's at Stamford Bridge on Saturday would have started accusations of corruption.

Here in England thankfully we accept honest incompetence.

There are those who think Mourinho harms the sport with these off-field power plays, and they have a point. But so does he. Ashley Barnes of Burnley should have followed Nemanja Matic down the tunnel on Saturday. Matic’s retaliation merited a red card, but so did Barnes’s tackle.

At the very least his behaviour was worthy of two yellows, having already hit Branislav Ivanovic in mid-air in the first half. Referee Martin Atkinson punished neither challenge. His performance was extraordinarily poor.

Mourinho is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign, but entitled to ask questions. His players, fine players, are frequently under siege. Not since Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United has a ball-carrying forward been treated as brutally as Eden Hazard this season.

Atkinson's refereeing performance was extraordinarily poor for Chelsea's game against Burnley on Saturday

Eden Hazard has been treated brutally by opposition players this season, and Mourinho is right to protect him

Ronaldo, however, was becoming a world star and referees were intimidated by him. He would fall and seize hold of the ball, stopping the game and pre-empting the decision to award a foul in his favour. Hazard plays on.

He didn’t even make a fuss when Phil Bardsley of Stoke City committed one of the most spectacularly vicious tackles seen in this campaign. Somehow the defender stayed on.

So Mourinho is justified in raising the issue, even if his chosen method is unconventional. Could he have aired the same grievances in private, opened dialogue with Mike Riley, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Board?

Yes — but one presumes he has those conversations all the time. By using a public forum, and an expansive 27 minutes of it, Mourinho broadens discussion.

Mourinho's visit to the Sky Studios could have been made more interesting if he was joined by Mike Riley

It would have been more interesting to invite Riley into the studio, too, but there is no way that happens in the present climate. The days of Clough versus Revie have passed. The default position of the authorities is to scan the news for any sign of controversy and then act.

They will study Mourinho’s appearance, have no doubt of it. They prefer silencing dissent rather than questioning its motives; just as Atkinson had the wit to deal with Matic’s obvious transgression, but no clue that Barnes came close to snapping his leg in two.

There is no chance Matic will get his red card rescinded, no matter the sense of injustice. He threw a player to the ground and that is a sending-off offence.

The Chelsea manager did not look happy as he watched on from the sidelines, and later aired his thoughts

His absence from the Capital One Cup final, as well as league games against West Ham United and Southampton is a big loss for Chelsea.

Yet if Atkinson does not know what a violent foul is maybe he needs to take a little time away from the game, too. Any idiot can spot that Matic had to go but a leading official should be able to see cause and effect.

Too many violent tackles are waved away these days. Hazard has seriously discussed getting larger shin pads to combat the kicking he receives; that should concern the authorities more than any manager’s well-honed grievance.

After Chelsea's game against Burnley, Jose Mourinho listed four minutes; four key incidents that he believed the referee had got wrong. Here, Sportsmail looks at them: 

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

33 - Ivanovic goes for goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It should have been a Chelsea penalty.

43 - Diego Costa goes to ground after  Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. It could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been  soft.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.
