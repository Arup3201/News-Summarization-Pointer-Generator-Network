It may have once made the longest commercial flight in history, but Qantas' first boeing 747-400 made its shortest journey to Illawarra Regional Airport on Sunday where it will now be the first plane of its type in the world to go on public display. 

After 25 years of service the City of Canberra plane was retired to an aviation museum based at Illawarra Regional Airport.

After less than 15 minutes in flight, the specially numbered Qantas Flight ‘747’ was delivered to its new home with the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society ((HARS) where it will become the only B747-400 in the world to be put on display.

Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said donating the aircraft to the HARRS museum will provide not only a great tourist attraction for the Illawarra region, but also an opportunity to preserve an important piece of Qantas’ and aviation history.

‘It's graced the pages of the record books, revolutionised air travel for Australians, marked a huge technical feat for Qantas and carried millions of passengers on their global adventures and home again,' said Mr Joyce.

'Our B747-400 'City of Canberra' is very deserving of a graceful retirement as the star attraction at one of Australia’s most prestigious aviation museums.’

ABC News reported that thousands of people gathered in and around the small airport to watch the landing, and they cheered and applauded loudly as the plane landed on the short and narrow runway - a distance less than half the length of Sydney Airport's runways.

The plane was so big that its two outside engines hung over the runway's edge as it landed on Illawarra Airport's runway. The runway is just 30 metres wide but the aircraft has a wingspan of 64 metres.

The Canberra left Sydney Airport and flew at just 4,000 feet and at a much slower speed than usual for its 15-minute hop down to Wollongong.

Now the oldest aircraft in the Qantas fleet, the Canberra holds the record for the longest ever non-stop commercial flight for its trip from London to Sydney in 1989.

Over the past few years, Qantas has been gradually retiring its older B747s. Nine of its newest jumbos, the last of which was delivered in 2003, have been refurbished and will continue flying into the future.

Since 2008, the Qantas Group has taken delivery of almost 150 new aircraft, lowering its fleet age to an average of just over seven years.

The aircraft will join an impressive line-up of famed aircraft located at HARS including a Lockheed Super Constellation, Catalina, Douglas DC3 and DC4 and a Desert Storm USS Army Cobra.
