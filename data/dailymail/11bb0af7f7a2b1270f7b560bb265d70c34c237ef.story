A quick-thinking teacher saved her sister from bleeding to death by using a passing pedestrian’s belt as a tourniquet after the pair were hit by an out-of-control car.

Teaching assistant Laura Reddy, 23, suffered a shattered right leg when she was hit by a car while walking home from work in South Molton, Devon, with her sister Nadine Marchant.

Ms Reddy was left bleeding heavily on the pavement after the incident - but Ms Marchant, 36, 
grabbed a passer-by’s belt and wrapped it tightly around her sister's upper 
leg to the stem the flow.

Doctors later told the pair that Ms Reddy would have bled to death if Ms Marchant had not acted so swiftly.

Ms Reddy said: 'Thank God Nadine did what she did, I’m so grateful to her. She literally saved my life.

'This crash has turned my whole life upside down but it has definitely brought Nadine and I closer.

'The doctors said if she hadn’t done what she did I would have bled out and died before the ambulance arrived.'

Injury: Ms Reddy nearly lost her leg after a car driven by a 90-year-old driver crashed into her in South Molton, Devon, last November

Ms Reddy said she could feel herself 'fading' following the accident and told Nadine she did not think I was going to make it.

'But Nadine kept telling me off and told me not to speak like that,' she said.

The sisters both work at South Molton Community College in Devon and were walking home to Ms Marchant's house to prepare for a charity party when the crash happened.

Motorist William Peto, 90, got his shoe jammed onto the accelerator pedal while attempting a three-point turn in his Smart car and careered into them at 20-25mph.

Recovery: Ms Reddy, from Bishops Nympton, Devon, suffered extensive blood loss following the crash and spent five months recovering from her injuries

Ms Reddy, who has just graduated with a degree in Human Psychology from Aston University, Birmingham, said: 'We were chatting away when we heard a car’s engine revving heavily.

'At first we thought it was a boy racer. The sound was loud enough to make us both look up. As we did, right in front of us a car mounted the pavement, it all happened so quickly.'

Ms Marchant was thrown onto the road by the car and was left with a chipped kneecap and badly bruised hands.
But Ms Reddy took the full force of the impact and was hurled several 
metres along the pavement - leaving bone protruding from her right leg.

'The car only stopped when it hit a telegraph pole and it was still accelerating when it came to a halt,' said Ms Reddy.

'My first reaction was to try and stand up due to the adrenaline and shock, but I soon realised the bone was sticking out of my leg and I couldn’t lift it at all. I don’t think anything can get close to the pain I felt, it was absolute agony.'

Ms Reddy said she was screaming loudly and was convinced her leg had gone and there was nothing that could be done to save it.

Despite
her own injuries, Ms Marchant went to her sister’s aid and asked a man who
was walking past the scene if she could use his belt.
Paramedics then rushed her to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, 
Somerset, for emergency vascular surgery before being transferred to 
Frenchay Hospital, Bristol.

Ms Reddy, of Bishops Nympton, Devon, was facing the prospect of amputation but doctors re-built her leg with skin from her back and left leg.

She said: 'The possibility of losing my whole leg hung over me for several weeks.

'One of the Mobile International Surgical Team (MIST) doctors said it was one of the worst lower limb injuries they’d ever seen. It was touch and go for a while but they managed to save my leg.'

She spent about three weeks in hospital before coming home where she was bed bound for about five months.

'My right leg is now slightly shorter due to bone loss and I have had to learn to walk again,' she said. Before the accident I only ever wore skirts and leggings but now I have to wear trousers all the time.'

Nadine, who still works at South Molton Community College, said she often replayed the moment in her head. She said: 'Every day I walk past the scene and try to make sense of what happened.

'I wish I could have responded by pushing her out of the way but everything happened so quickly.I just did the only thing I could think of to help her.'

Pensioner William Peto, 90, of Lapford, Devon, was banned from driving indefinitely on November 23 after pleading guilty to careless driving at Exeter Crown Court.

He was also fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £100 costs following the crash in November 11 last year.
