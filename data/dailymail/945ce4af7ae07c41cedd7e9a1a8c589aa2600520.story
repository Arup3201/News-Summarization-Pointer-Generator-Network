She makes no secret of the fact that she cheats her way to model cheekbones with make-up but it seems that Kim Kardashian's face isn't the only part of her body to benefit from contouring.

The 34-year-old reality star has been using make-up to enhance her cleavage and has reportedly hired a contouring expert to make sure she gets it spot on. 

According to The Sun, the mother-of-one has enlisted the help of Jessica Mirdita, who uses bronzer and highlighter to give Kim 'an instant boob job'.

A source told the paper that Kim's husband, Kanye West, who has been revamping her style in recent months, is on board.

'He thinks she has a phenomenal body and every part should be celebrated,' they said.

While little is known about Ms Mirdita, she is believed to be a colleague of Kim's long-standing make-up artist, Mario Dedivanovic.

Her Instagram page is littered with photos of Mr Dedivanovic, many accompanied by gushing captions thanking him for being 'awesome'.

'Thank you for everything,' reads one especially complimentary missive. 'You're just as awesome of a person as you are a makeup artist! [sic] And thank you especially for taking me across the world.'

Kim's Celine coat

Kim switched it up in a Celine wool coat with an ultra luxe fur collar. Both cozy and cool, Kim flys from Paris to LA in the shape of a style icon.

Celine is currently under the creative direction of Phoebe Philo, a designer well known for her feminine, sensual and luxurious attention to detail. We can only imagine how fabulous that fur feels when protecting one from those bitterly cold gusts of winter wind.

Kim is totally on point with how she paired her coat to make for a sleek, chic monochromatic look. Whether in Paris, London or New York, all black always works. This coat would also look great with jeans and sneakers for a more effortless feel.

Sadly, this number is no longer available but we have some fabulous options just for you, ranging from a Marc New York investment piece to a vegan friendly bargain below at only $39.17.

The account also includes a behind the scenes snap on set with Kim, which she, in typically florid style, captioned: 'She's just as perfect in real life as in pictures. 

'Thank you again @makeupbymario for allowing me to assist you and watch you first hand working your magic.'

MailOnline has contacted Kim Kardashian and Jessica Mirdita for comment.  

If true, her bust is just one of the many parts of Kim Kardashian's body to get the contouring treatment.

Last year, she began using Charlotte Tilbury's £45 Supermodel Body, which promises to let you 'cheat your way to your dream body', to define and enhance her legs.

Speaking about the product, which Tilbury describes as being 'like shapewear for your skin', Kim said: 'It's legendary! I used it on my legs.'

Make-up maestro Tilbury, who shared her beauty tips with Kim during her time in London, said of the product: 'I have poured all my make-up artist know-how into creating this incredible slimmer shimmer.'

The product is enriched with FermiProtect, a wild shitake mushroom extract that protects the collagen fibres in the skin.

According to Tilbury, it also has a firming effect and makes skin look toned and supple, even if it is really nothing of the sort.

The product also contains precious-metal highlighter mix to re-create what Tilbury calls her secret 'celebrity limb trick' -  a technique which sees her use highlighter on the centre of legs and arms to create the illusion of leaner, longer limbs.

Another key ingredient, caffeine, will be familiar to anyone who has used cellulite creams in the past, and promises to detox the skin and banish puffiness.

'It's easy body makeup-in-a-minute,' adds Tilbury, who applies it by twisting the applicator and rolling the cooling-metal massager down the centre of  limbs before blending out with her hands.

'Any stylist will tell you that wearing black slims, streamlines and contours but white widens,' she continues.

'They’re basic laws of art, photography and make-up artistry. I always use the same principles when body contouring.

'You can elongate and slim by highlighting down the centre, and shading at the edges. I’ve using this trick on the glorious angels of the runway and stars on the red carpet for years.'

Speaking about working with the reality TV star, Tilbury said: 'I had the pleasure of working with the charming and absolutely beautiful Kim Kardashian - she has the most outrageously natural long lashes I've ever seen!'.
