One in ten Americans think 'space aliens' were involved in the disappearance if the Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, it was revealed today.

A survey found that nine per cent of the people believe 'space aliens or beings from another dimension were involved'.

The poll by CNN and ORC International found that while most people in the U.S. believe the search for MH370 should continue, half believe authorities are searching in the wrong place.

Findings also showed that the vast majority (79 per cent) believe there are no survivors.

Just over half (52 per cent) think we will eventually find out what happened to the flight. However, a further 46 per cent say we will never know.

The survey comes as 11 terrorists with links to Al Qaeda were arrested in Kuala Lumpur and Kedah and questioned about being involved in the plane's disappearance.

Aged between 22 and 55, the suspects were believed to have comprised students, business professionals and odd-job workers.

Terrorism was seen as a possible cause of the disappearance by Americans, with 57 per cent of those surveyed saying terrorists were likely involved, despite no group or organisation yet coming forward to take responsibility.

Furthermore, 42 per cent of the U.S. public believes hijackers were involved, while 52 per cent said a mechanical failure was probably involved.

Just a quarter said it was very likely that the crew or plane's pilots had something to do with the disappearance.

Yesterday, it was revealed the Malaysian tourism minister has said the government will not inject any more money into the state-owned Malaysian Airlines after the MH370 disaster.

The ailing national carrier has suffered a slump in bookings and Â£750 million losses following the disappearance of the flight two months ago and is undergoing 'restructuring'.

Mohammad Nazri Abdul Aziz, Minister of Tourism and Culture, said the government will not put 'any more money' into the troubled airline.

Malaysia Airlines - which is owned by the government through a holding company - had already suffered $1.3billion losses over the past three years as it faced stiff competition and unprofitable routes, Gulf News reports.

Mr Aziz said that the government is now unsure what it can do - but he added: 'To inject new capital is certainly not an option.'

It now looks unlikely that the government will sell the national carrier to private investor after the share price dropped both under the restructuring plans and the flight MH370 disaster.
