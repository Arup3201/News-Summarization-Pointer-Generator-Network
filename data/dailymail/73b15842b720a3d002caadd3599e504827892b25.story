This is the moment the final passengers were winched to safety off of a burning Greek ferry after being trapped for nearly 36 hours adrift in the  Adriatic Sea.

Around 400 passengers were trapped on the deck of the Norman Atlantic after a fire started on a car deck before tearing through the rest of the ship.

At least 11 died as emergency workers struggled through wind and rain-lashed seas to mount a daring rescue operation, which largely took place in the dark.

The dramatic images were revealed today as it was alleged the Italian crew were among the first to flee in the ship's lifeboats, leaving women and children behind.

To the rescue: This is the moment the last survivors of the Greek ferry fire were airlifted from the deck of the vessel after spending 36 hours in the wind and rain when a fire ripped through the car deck below

Desperate: At least 11 people are thought to have died after acrid smoke filled the cabins on the overnight ferry, causing panic, amid allegations that the staff were among the first to leave

Trapped: Around 400 people had to be airlifted from the ship during the night of December 28 after ropes on board the ship were not strong enough to attach it to a tug-boat

Nick Channing-Williams was on board the  vessel with Greek fiancee Regina Theoffili when the fire broke out below deck.

The 37-year-old, who has now returned home in Berkshire, said he and a group of other passengers attempted to connect tow ropes from a tug boat to the ferry when the crew were nowhere to be found.

He told The Times: 'There were no crew members down there - it was just us. I couldn't work that out. From what I understood, some of the crew members bailed out at the beginning.'

Mr Channing-Williams added that some crew members had 'got off with the first lifeboats'.

He said: 'There were so many women and children left on the boat. Why were they not the first in line to get on the lifeboat? 

Struggle: Survivors of the ferry fire huddle together on the deck while the ship continues to burn around them, 36 hours after the blaze started

Up in smoke: Images taken from the front of the ship, on top of the bridge, shows the lower decks consumed by smoke and fire which left at least 11 people dead

Panic: This image, taken below deck on the Norman Atlantic, shows smoke filling the corridors as passengers struggle to escape the burning ship

Abandoned: Witnesses say they were woken in their cabins by the smoke, and received almost no advice from cabin crew while trying to make their escape 

'It was just chaos. And I think there should be a few people with their heads a bit low.

'From what I understood, the ropes on board the ship were not good enough to tow it. They (the crew on the bridge) were screaming at us 'quicker, quicker'. 

'Regina was getting very frustrated with them. She was like "why don't you go down there?"'

A spokesman for Anek Lines told the paper: 'It is too early now to deal with responsibilities about the accident. I don't have any evidence that the crew left before the passengers.'

The blaze broke out on the car deck on Sunday while the ferry was travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona in Italy.

Safe at last: A woman is helped on to a stretcher at the port of Taranto in Italy. Witnesses describe survivors huddling together on the top deck to avoid the heat coming through the floor from the fire

Saved: A medic wraps a blanket around one of the ferry survivors who stood for hours in freezing wind and driving rain in little clothing after they fled their cabins

On dry land: A cargo boat which helped to take some of the shaken passengers to shore unloads them as medics wait to treat them on the quayside

The fire caused thick, acrid smoke to fill cabins, waking passengers on the overnight ferry. In the chaos that followed, passengers reported receiving virtually no instructions from the crew.

The principle of women and children first appeared to go out of the window, and passengers started pushing and shoving and came to blows over seats in the lifeboats and helicopter baskets.

There is still confusion over the numbers of people on board, prompting fears from Italian prosecutors that more bodies may be found once the ship is recovered from the Adriatic Sea.

The names of some survivors were not on the manifest and some passengers listed might not have boarded, officials said. A total of 427 people were rescued, while Anek Lines said there were 475 on board.

In an inspection just days before the disaster, the ship was found to have failings with fire safety and its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency.

Lucky ones: Tearful relatives embrace after being reunited following the fire which killed at least 11 people

Mystery: Authorities still don't know exactly how many people were on board the ship, raising the prospect of more bodies being trapped inside the wreckage of the ship
