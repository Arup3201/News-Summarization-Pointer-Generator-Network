Bombarded: Broadcaster Andrew Marr has thanked viewers for their 'truly wonderful' messages of goodwill following his stroke two weeks ago

Broadcaster Andrew Marr has thanked viewers and friends who have 'bombarded' him with 'truly wonderful' messages of goodwill as he continues to recover in hospital following a serious stoke.

The BBC's political editor, who was admitted to hospital after falling ill at his south west London home two weeks ago, is said to be 'on the mend'.

But a BBC spokesperson told MailOnline today that his return to work is 'not expected to be imminent' and that a new line-up of guest hosts for his Sunday morning show is being organised.

Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine yesterday filled in for the 53-year-old on BBC One's weekly Andrew Marr Show, and told viewers his colleague had spoken to the programme's producers.

Mr Vine said: 'He's on the mend and he does send a huge thank you to friends and viewers who've bombarded him with goodwill messages.

'He says that's been truly wonderful, he's really looking forward to retuning to work in due course and resuming duties on a Sunday morning.

He added: 'Andrew, I gather you are watching right now so good luck from all of us here with your recuperation.'

The previous week's show, which regularly features interviews with leading politicians, was presented by BBC News deputy political editor James Landale.

On Sunday, BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth will stand in for the father-of-three, who has been married to journalist Jackie Ashley for 25 years.

Mr Marr is considered young to have 
suffered a stroke, with the majority of the 150,000 people who suffer 
the attack every year in England over the age of 65.

A fitness fanatic, Mr Marr is a keen runner and is known to exercise regularly wherever he is filming.

He is shown on the opening titles of his weekly show riding a moped through the capital and parking outside the studio.

The
acclaimed journalist, broadcaster and author wrote and fronted the 
award-winning History of Modern Britain and The Making of Modern Britain
for BBC2.

His documentary Diamond Queen was also extremely popular, as is his most recent offering, History of the World.

Last week a BBC spokesman said he was making 'good progress' and was working on physiotherapy with 'his customary determination'.

The statement at that Mr Marr and his family would like to thank everyone for the 'fantastic support they have received 'in terms of cards, e-mails, texts, tweets and flowers.'

The veteran journalist has reportedly 
been requesting old editions of his favourite programme, including 
episodes of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs from the last 20 years, to 
enjoy from his hospital bed.

Mr Marr, who lives in East Sheen and always abstains from alcohol in January, also presents Start The Week on Radio 4, which is being hosted by guest presenters.

He interviewed Prime Minister David Cameron on his show the week before falling ill and receivedÂ  messages of support on Twitter from the likes of Labour leader, Ed Miliband, and author Salman Rushdie.

His career in journalism began at The Scotsman newspaper in 1981, and he later moved to London to become its political correspondent.

He was part of the team which launched The Independent in 1986 and returned as its editor, after a stint at The Economist magazine.

Mr Marr also worked as a columnist for The Express and The Observer before moving into television, joining the BBC as political editor, in May 2000.
