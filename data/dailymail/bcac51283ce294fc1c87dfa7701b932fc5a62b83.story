As images of the terrifying hostage crisis in a cafe in central Sydney were broadcast around the nation, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the government does not know the gunman's motivations and urged Australians to go about their lives as usual.  

At least thirteen people - possibly more - are being held hostage in the Lindt  cafe in Martin Place, in central Sydney, with shocked and sobbing victims seen holding an Islamic flag against the windows of the popular chocolate store.

As heavily armed police swarmed the streets, buildings went into lock-down across the CBD and even the city's iconic Opera House was evacuated, Mr Abbott urged Australians to go about their lives as usual.  

'The whole point is to scare people out of being themselves': Prime Minister Tony Abbott has called on Australians to continue to go about their usual lives

City in lockdown: A woman, pictured, was assisted as thousands of people were evacuated from their offices in Martin Place, in the city's centre, and the surrounding area

Fearful workers: Lindt chocolate staff were pictured pinned against the window of their store, holding up an Islamic flag

Crisis: There have been varying reports about the number of hostages being held by the armed gunman

'We don't yet know the motivation of the perpetrator,' he said. 'We don't know if the motivation is politically motivated although obviously there are some signs it could be.' 

'The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,' he said. 

Mr Abbott continued: 'Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society. 

'Nothing should ever change that and that's why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual. 

The Prime Minister said the National Security Committee - which includes the Foreign Minister, Treasurer and Attorney-General - has today met in Canberra.

He revealed he has been constantly briefed by with Australian Federal Police commissioner Andrew Colvin, New South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione and the state premier, Mike Baird.

Guns: The hostage crisis began when a woman made a report to police around 9:40am this morning

Thousands evacuated: As many as a dozen workers and customers at the Lindt cafe are being held prisoner

But while the crisis will make many Australians fearful, Mr Abbott said everyone should keep their thoughts and prayers of the victims of the crisis.  

'This is a very disturbing incident and I can understand the concerns and anxiety of the Australian people at a time like this.

'Our thoughts and prayers must go out to the individuals in this,' he said. 'I can think of almost nothing more distressing and terrifying than to be caught up in this situation.' 

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today said he had offered Mr Abbott his full support.

He said: 'Australians can be assured that we are one when it comes to keeping Australians safe.'

The government will this afternoon go ahead with the release of its MYEFO (Mid Year Economic Forecast and Outlook) report.
