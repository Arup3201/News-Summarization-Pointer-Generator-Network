National Hunt jockeys Sam Twiston-Davies and Jamie Moore are both calling upon their fathers for help as they attempt to win over the mile and a half Epsom Derby course on Thursday.

Twiston-Davies will partner Golden Jubilee, trained by his father Nigel, while Moore, younger brother of three-time champion Flat jockey Ryan, will be on Whinging Willie who has been prepared in the Sussex stable of his father Gary.

The HCC International Jump Jockeys Derby is the feature race on Thursday afternoon’s card with 10 riders who are more used to racing over fences and hurdles ready to tackle the most iconic Flat track in the world.

Fatherly love: Twiston-Davies will hope to win at Epsom on Golden Jubilee, who is trained by his father Nigel

The other jockeys involved include Brendan Powell, Nick Scholfield and Harry Skelton.

Moore won the Jump Jockeys Derby last year on Rossetti, who was also trained by his father.

He said: ‘This race gives us jump jockeys an exciting opportunity to ride the Investec Derby course and it was great to win it last year.

‘Whinging Willie ran well last time out to win by a nose at Brighton. He’s come out of the race well and hopefully he can repeat that form at Epsom.’
