Anderson Cooper's next set of tough questions could be reserved for his long-term boyfriend Ben Maisani after pictures of him surfaced kissing another man.

Maisani, 39, was spotted in a close embrace with a dark-haired, muscle-bound man in a New York park.

The images may come as a surprise to the CNN news anchor after it was reported last month that he wanted to marry his partner as soon as Labor Day.

The wedding rumor came several weeks after Cooper, 45, spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time, saying: ''The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be more happy.'

There was no hint of upset from Cooper last night  who looked typically sharp in a navy suit as he joined other A-listers in New York to watch Beyonce perform at the UN headquarters for World Humanitarian Day.

It is believed that Cooper has been dating Maisani, who owns gay bar Eastern Bloc in Manhattan's East Village for around three years.

The couple live together at Cooper's converted fire station townhouse and enjoy a low-key lifestyle, working out and going to dinner with friends including Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.

They were encouraged to marry last year by Anderson's mother, designer Gloria Vanderbilt. She reportedly helped the pair patch up their relationship after they struggled with conflicting work schedules.

Cooper agreed to cut back on trips abroad, while Maisani said he would do fewer night shifts at his bar. Vanderbilt,
 88, was also reportedly encouraging the men to adopt a child.

Cooper's sexuality has long been an open secret in TV circles, but for him to state it publicly was a brave and bold move.

He
 said he was moved by recent events such as Barack Obama's endorsement 
of gay marriage - and hopes his example will put an end to bullying.

The journalist is also one of the most high profile people to come out in recent 
years, given that he hosts CNN's 'Anderson Cooper 360' and his own 
daytime TV talk show.
