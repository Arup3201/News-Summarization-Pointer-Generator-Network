A desperate jobseeker has promised an iPad to anyone who can find him work, resorting to attention grabbing stunts to land a job.

Dan Conway, 27, was made redundant just days before the birth of his second child in June last year and after sending hundreds of CVs applications with little success, decided to go the extra mile to grab employers’ attention.

Calling himself the Extreme Job Hunter, Mr Conway set up a website promising new outlandish stunts each week until he finds paid work.

During the arts graduate’s year-long job hunt so far, he has posted a video of his two-year-old daughter Lucy asking to ‘please get my daddy a job,’ delivered CVs hidden in party piñatas, posted himself for sale on ebay and sent donuts with offers to work for free.

Now he is appealing to the public to help him land a job by launching a competition to win an iPad Mini. He has promised to buy a brand new tablet with his first month of wages for anyone who can find him work.

The attention-grabbing attempts have 
attracted plenty of attention, including a radio interview, several 
interviews and work placements, as well as boosted his failing 
confidence after his tough job hunt living on benefits.

Search stunts: After sending out hundreds of job applications with little response, Mr Conway set up a website promising new stunts each week until he finds paid work 

He said: ‘My wife was just days away from giving birth to our second child Jack so it was a massive blow.

‘We were devastated but I was confident that I would find a job again quickly.

‘Anyone who’s been unemployed will tell you how awful it is. I have a beautiful family that I just want to provide for. 

‘I know publicity stunts won’t get me a job, but may get the attention of the right person so I can prove I have the skills.’

Helping daddy: Daughter Lucy featured in a YouTube video appeal, Mr Conway's first attempt to catch employers' attention

Mr
 Conway graduated with a degree from Leeds College of Art and Design 
studying creative advertising but began working as a youth support 
worker four years ago. He was a senior project manager at a school for 
children with additional needs when he was made redundant in June last 
year.

After responding to hundreds of job adverts and sending out CVs, Mr Conway found he barely received one response.

Mr
 Conway said: ‘It was soul destroying. I was desperate to find work but 
couldn’t even get a foot in the door. I knew I had to try and tackle it 
head on or lose my confidence all together.’

Sell yourself: Mr Conway even posted an advert on ebay selling himself for £25,000 in a bid to get a job until the site took down the ad, which breached their guidelines

Sweet bribery: Mr Conway landed a work placement after mailing a box of donuts with an offer to work for free. He hopes this will lead to his dream job

When he set up the website, his first appeal was a video made with his daughter in which the toddler helps her father chalk messages onto the floor explaining why he would make a good employee.

He said: ‘I know not everyone likes this approach, in fact I think you love it or hate it. But the field in which I’ve studied and trained is creative so I figured I had nothing to lose by trying to demonstrate how creative I can be.’

After several other stunts he decided to start the competition.

The jobseeker said: ‘People hear about jobs but I needed an incentive for them to take the time to tell me about them or tell their employers about me. Everyone wants an iPad mini so I started the competition to win one and had a brilliant response.’

‘I would love to take someone into the Apple store and buy him or her a tablet for helping me get a job,’ he says.

'Money talks': He even sent out Monopoly money with covering letters and hid CVs in party pinatas in his hunt for a job

His distinctive idea of hiding his CV in piñatas, inspired by his daughter’s birthday party, led to an appeal on radio but no job offer.

He said: ‘Everyone loved the piñata and I was looking for a way to make my CV stand out. I was writing and sending so many covering letters that I was bored of reading them myself so I imaged how bored the employers must be.’

Dan has been offered a work placement after mailing a box of donuts with an offer to work for free. He hopes it will help him land his dream job.

Other stunts include sending Monopoly money with his covering letters and a covering letter jokingly warning employers they need to employ more red heads by law and offering his services.

He said: ‘This is one of my favourites because it jokingly suggests they will get fined if they don’t have the right number of ginger employees and urging them to take me on quickly to avoid prosecution.’

He’s currently dreaming up more stunts and plans to continue posting stunts until he gains employment.

He said: ‘I have to stay confident that I will eventually get noticed by the right person. In the meantime the support from all my followers helps keep me positive and give me fresh ideas.’

Employ more red heads: Mr Conway also sent this cover letter, warning potential employers that they must by law employ more workers with red hair, offering his services
