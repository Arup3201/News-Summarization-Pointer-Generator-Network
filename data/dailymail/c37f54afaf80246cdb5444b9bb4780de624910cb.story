Break the cycle: Northants PCC Adam Simmonds claims the plan will help reoffenders stop crime

Feckless families should be put through ‘two years of hell’ in boot camps to turn their lives around, a crime tsar has urged.

Layabout parents – like the characters in hit TV show Shameless – would undergo an ‘intensive’ programme to keep them out of crime and unemployment, says Adam Simmonds, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Northamptonshire.

He said derelict Army bases could be used to house them while they were taught basic household skills, ordered to stop drinking and smoking, and given basic job training.

Their children, meanwhile, would be educated properly. ‘You’ve got to break the cycle, tackle that poverty of ambition,’ Mr Simmonds told The Mail on Sunday.

The PCC – whose pioneering plan to merge police and fire services won praise from Home Secretary Theresa May – insists his idea would be cheaper than repeatedly sending career criminals to jail and taking their offspring into care.

An adult prison place costs £40,000 a year while it costs an estimated £140,000 a year to keep a young person in a children’s home.

The Tory PCC said that in Kettering, Northants, police believe that just ten families are responsible for the majority of burglaries. 

He added: ‘The kids don’t go to school, none of them are in work. They cause the bulk of the problem – they go to prison, come out, generation after generation.

‘I’d like to take them out of Kettering, put them somewhere else to retrain the family.

‘We’ve got to be more radical than sending social workers to get mum and dad out of bed. Sending them to prison hasn’t worked so what else do you do?’

Under his plan, the most troubled 
households would be told they could escape the cycle of reoffending and 
unemployment by agreeing to go into a new residential programme.

Disused Army bases would be redeveloped to house the families.

He added: ‘The people who run this are going to put them through hell for two years.

‘There’s something in the idea of discipline, doing it in a different location and doing it as a family. Tell the man, you’re going to get up, have breakfast, go for a run, quit smoking and drinking.’

But criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher said: ‘It would be extremely difficult to administer and manage, and it may run counter to the European Convention on Human Rights.’

The Tory Government of the 1990s introduced boot camps for young offenders but research suggested they did not cut reoffending and were too costly.
