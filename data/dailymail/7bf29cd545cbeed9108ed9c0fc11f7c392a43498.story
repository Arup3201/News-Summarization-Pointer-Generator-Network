Killed: Mido Macia, pictured with his sister Melida, was arrested on Tuesday evening in the Daveyton township and dragged to his death. The police officers have been charged with murder

Eight police officers accused of handcuffing taxi driver Mido Macia to their patrol car and dragging him along the street until he died have been arrested on murder charges.

Video footage captured on a mobile phone shows officers attaching the 27-year-old Mozambican to the back of their van and brazenly speeding off before a crowd of horrified onlookers.

Mr Macia was found dead in a police cell two hours later in Daveyton, South Africa.

The country's police chief today said she shared 'the extreme shock and outrage' over the video footage, as she announced the officers involved had been suspended and the local police commander removed from his post.

General Riah Phiyega said she fully supports the investigation by the police watchdog
 agency and added the rights of Mr Macia were 'violated in the most extreme form'.

Investigators
 are said to have been told that the taxi driver assaulted one of the 
police officers and took his gun.

But South Africa's Daily Sun today 
revealed new video footage which appears to contradict officers' version
 of events.

It appears to show the cab driver arguing with police officers with his hands by his side, before he is manhandled to the ground by up to five men in uniform.

The scandal is only the latest to undermine confidence in South Africa's police, heaping yet more shame on a
 force that opened fire on striking workers at the Marikana platinum 
mine in August last year, killing 34 people.

A crowd gathered as at least four officers were seen to be manhandling Mr Macia

It also comes as the Oscar Pistorius murder trial puts the country’s criminal justice system in the spotlight.

Mr Macia was arrested in the Daveyton 
township outside Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. An anonymous witness 
told a local newspaper: ‘[Police] argued with Macia and then they beat 
him up.

‘They handcuffed him to the back of the van and slammed the door in his face.

‘With blood running down his face they
 drove off. He was in pain. He cried and asked the cops to stop but they
 continued anyway.’

Outraged: Angry protesters gather outside the Daveyton Police station in Daveyton, South Africa

Crowds demonstrated outside the police station after Mido Macia was handcuffed to the back of a police van and dragged for about 500m

South Africa’s Independent Police 
Investigative Directorate, which has launched an investigation, said the
 probable cause of death was head injuries with internal bleeding.

Spokesman Moses Dlamini said 
investigators had been told Mr Macia was asked to move his minibus taxi 
by two policemen because it was blocking the road.

Mr Macia then allegedly assaulted one 
of the officers and took his gun, before officers managed to put the 
‘resisting suspect’ into the van to go to the cells.

A prisoner who was in the police station said: ‘They killed him. They beat him up so badly in here.’ 

One onlooker told the South African Daily Sun that Mr Macia was heard begging police to stop the assault

Mr Macia was held with his hands handcuffed above his head before the driver of the police van pulled away

Despite his plea for police to stop attacking him, officers carried on beating Mr Macia

The incident has prompted a  furious 
backlash in South Africa. Frans Cronje from the South African Institute 
of Race Relations think-tank said: ‘It is a level of  barbarity on a par
 with police behaviour at Marikana.

‘We strongly support the police use of force to meet the criminal onslaught.

‘But this is an ill-disciplined and 
brutal rabble that have lost all respect for themselves, their jobs, the
 societies they work in.’
