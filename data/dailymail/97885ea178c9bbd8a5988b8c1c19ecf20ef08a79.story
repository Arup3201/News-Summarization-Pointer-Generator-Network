A woman was rescued after she backed into a 17-feet deep sinkhole that opened up in her tanning salon's parking lot in Ross Township, Pennsylvania yesterday.

Allegheny High School teacher Natalie Huddleston had just finished a session at Hollywood Tans around 4:30pm when she heard a 'thunk' and felt her car start to teeter.

'I was kind of sticking up in the air, kind of disoriented. Hit the gas, nothing happened. No contact with anything in the back wheels. They were spinning. I felt a rocking motion and I felt myself sinking,' Huddlseton told WTAE.

Trapped: A sinkhole opened up in Ross Township, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, swallowing up a car in a tanning salon's parking lot

Need for repair: Authorities say the sinkhole opened up due to a collapsed storm drain underneath the store

So she called the tanning salon to ask for help and owner Lisa Masley came running.

'When I went out to help her, I kept thinking, "Don't stand too close." I was a little nervous when I was out there. And as soon as we got her out, we just ran into the salon.'

Just seconds after pulling her out of the window of the car, Huddleston's car was swallowed whole into the sinkhole.

According to the town manager, the sinkhole emerged after a storm pipe collapses in recent heavy rains.

'When we get a heavy rain like that, it caused an additional issue and the fact the pipes were outdated and needed to be replaced,' Ross Township POlice Detective Brian Kohlhepp said.

Town manager Douglas Sample says maintenance of the pipes is the local businesses' responsibility, but that the city took video of the deteriorating pipes two years ago and warned the store owners to repair them.

Some business owners took the advice, while others didn't.

Wednesday morning, crews were busy clearing the sinkhole and repairs are expected to take about a week. Â
