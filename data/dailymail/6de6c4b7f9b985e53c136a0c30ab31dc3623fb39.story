She said a replacement bus was immediately dispatched to ensure commuters were not left stranded.

She added: 'Our bus was mechanically sound. We suspect it skidded on the wet road.'

The front end of the vehicle was partially crushed from the impact and was surrounded by broken glass and chunks of cement. 

A large section of the busy road surrounding the wreckage was cordoned off and several roads in the area were also shut while emergency services attempted to remove the bus.

The accident caused major traffic issues throughout the city.
