Two partners in crime face being jailed for contempt after they snogged in a court dock on Valentine's Day.

Besotted lovers Samson Paine, 25, and Karla Shaw, 24, could not be kept apart by dock officers as they went to embrace when they were remanded in custody at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent.

Shaw stood on a seat, threw her arms around stockily-built Paine's neck and planted a lingering kiss on his lips.

Judge Charles Byers, 63, had admonished Paine for slouching and talking and asked for him to be taken to the cells.

A woman dock officer stepped between the couple, but Shaw was determined to kiss her boyfriend goodbye.

Unimpressed Judge Byers, whose father Baron Byers was a life peer, declared: 'At the end of this case they will be sentenced for contempt. I am not having it.

'They misbehaved last time, they misbehaved this time. Unless I make a firm stand, that will go on.'

He told the couple: 'I hope it was worth it.'

Shaw cheekily replied: 'You don't know how worth it that was. Happy Valentine's. Sorry.'

She told Paine: 'I love you Sam.'

After they were taken to the cells, Judge Byers told their lawyers: 'You can tell them, with my felicitations, they can look forward to a consecutive sentence.

'They plainly have absolutely no respect.'

Speaking afterwards, a male barrister said: 'It was a smacker of a kiss. I was married for 15 years and didn't have kiss like that.'

The passionate encounter came after Shaw, from Chatham, Kent, admitted robbery and assault causing actual bodily harm.

Shaw robbed a woman of cigarettes and cash and assaulted her on May 20 last year, the court was told.

Paine, of no fixed address, admitted attempted robbery and possessing an offensive weapon - a knife.

Also in the dock was Christopher Standford, 49, ofÂ  Rochester, who also admitted attempting to rob Huseyin Turkucu of cash on December 9 last year.

All three were remanded in custody and sentence was adjourned until February 22.
