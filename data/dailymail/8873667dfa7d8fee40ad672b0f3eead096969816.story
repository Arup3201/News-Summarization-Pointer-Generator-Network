A former Texas high school teacher and tennis coach allegedly had sex with a student in the back seat of his car, according to arrest records.

Taylor Lee McClain, 43, of Kingwood, was arrested and also also charged with two counts of possession of child pornography, authorities said.

The sexual assault occurred October 20, as McClain and two girls, ages 15 and 16, were driving from a fundraiser to a nearby ‘haunted house,’ according to court documents.

The two girls are students at Atascocita High School in Texas, where McCain used to work, the Houston Chronicle reports.

The younger girl told investigators that during the drive, McClain and the other girl were drinking Smirnoff Ice vodka.

According to the arrest warrant, the witness, who was in the back seat of the car, said she saw the other girl perform oral sex on McClain.

As the three were leaving the haunted house, the younger of the two girls said she got a text message from the other girl asking if she wanted to join a sexual threesome with her and McClain.

The younger girl replied no, according to records.

On the way back from the haunted house, McClain stopped the car at the entrance at West Lake Houston Parkway and Aerobic Drive, records state.

He and the 16-year-old girl got into the back seat and asked the younger girl to drive.

While the witness drove around the neighborhood, she said she could hear McClain and the girl having sex in the back seat, according to records.

The younger girl reportedly asked McClain to adjust the steering wheel to make it easier for her to drive.

He replied that it would be awkward because his pants were off, records state.

The younger girl told police that she had seen the other girl sending nude photos of herself to McClain between September and November.

She said it happened so many times that she was not clear on the dates, according to records.

McClain, who is free on $30,000 bail, is scheduled to appear in the 337th State District Court on February 7.
