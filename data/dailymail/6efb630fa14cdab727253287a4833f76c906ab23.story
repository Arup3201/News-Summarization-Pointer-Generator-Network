A letter  allegedly  written by President Obama to a candidate running for the Orange County Commission was discovered to be a fake because it was riddled with spelling mistakes.

Derrick Wallace, a candidate for the Orange County Commission, in Florida posted the letter that was allegedly from the president on his campaign's Facebook page.

And at first glance, the note appeared to be official, because it had a  White House emblem at the top and Obama's signature on the bottom.

Commission candidate: Derrick Wallace, a candidate for the Orange County Commission, in Florida posted the letter allegedly from the president on his campaign's Facebook page

President's approval: The note appeared to be official and had  Obama's signature on it

Letter: The letter soon began to raise red flags because it contained spelling mistakes and words such as 'Democrat' in lower case

The letter thanked Wallace for his support during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns and closed with a near-endorsement of him. 

It read: ‘As you know, as the number one democrat of the Democratic Party, I do not get in the middle of campaigns between two democrats. However, let this letter be my wink and node [sic].’

But it quickly raised red flags because it contained spelling mistakes such as the word accommodate and  the word 'Democrats was' spelled in lower case. 

And on closer inspection, the White House emblem on it was clearly photoshopped and the signature by Obama had been forged.

Wallace spoke with WFTV-Channel 9 and claimed that he had no idea that the letter on his Facebook page was a fake and had taken it down as soon as he realized it was not genuine.

He said: 'This came to us and we thought it was authentic. I thought it was sent from the president.'

And when questioned about how he could think it was authentic despite the letter being littered with spelling mistakes he shrugged it off.

He added: 'I was so happy to get that from the president that I posted it.'

Fake signature: The letter  had a fake signature that was supposed to have been written by President Obama

Candidates: Wallace is battling against candidate Victoria Siplin, right, for the District 6 seat on the commission

Wallace is battling against fellow candidate Victoria Siplin for the District 6 seat on the commission.

The winner will succeed outgoing Commissioner Tiffany Moore Russell, who is running for clerk of court.

The commission race is nonpartisan, but Wallace, who used to be a Republican recently said he had rejoined the Democratic Party.

Siplin's supporters had criticized him for changing his party affiliation for his own personal gain.

But Wallace described it as ‘a business decision.’  

Wallace said he believed that supporters of his political opponent Siplin could have also sent him  the letter to derail his campaign.

However, Siplin denied this and said her campaign had nothing to do with it.

‘I'm just focusing on my campaign,’ she said.
