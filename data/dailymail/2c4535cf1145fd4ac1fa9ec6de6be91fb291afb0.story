A mother was jailed for 45 years today for suffocating her six-year-old son in a motel room and dumping his body along a dirt road.

Julianne McCrery, 42, of Texas admitted killing Camden Hughes by kneeling on his back and covering his mouth with her hand.

The discovery of his body last May in Maine set off a nationwide effort to identify him. Meanwhile, his mother called his kindergarten daily to report him absent with appendicitis.

McCrery later told prosecutors she had
 planned to kill herself and that she killed Camden because no one else 
was fit to raise him.

But 
prosecutors say they have evidence McCrery felt the boy was an 
inconvenience and that she planned to go about her own life after 
killing him.

McCrery spent 
the drive from Texas to New England contemplating how she would kill her
 son, Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell said.

She said McCrery extinguished a bright star 'before he even had the chance to graduate from kindergarten'.

Morrell
 acknowledged that McCrery did not have an easy life but said 
investigators could not determine what led her to consider suicide 
and questioned McCrery's assertion that she planned to kill herself.

Morrell pointed out that McCrery had attempted suicide several years earlier by similar means and had failed.

'This case raises more questions than there are answers for,' Morrell said.

Tragic: The young boy, pictured here, was described as a 'bright star' and as an extraordinary' boy in court

McCrery spoke tearfully at her sentencing hearing, calling her son "extraordinary."

"I am very sorry to have caused the intense pain and suffering to my precious son Camden," she said.

"He did nothing whatsoever to deserve that by my hand, and he was not an inconvenience to me. My sorrow is intense and unbearable."

Defense attorney Julia Nye said an insanity defense was considered, but McCrery rejected that option.

'She chose to accept responsibility for her actions,' Nye said.

McCrery
 pleaded guilty in November to kneeling atop her son as he laid 
face-down on the floor of their New Hampshire motel room floor in 
Hampton, New Hampshire.

She told investigators she covered his mouth with her hand as he struggled to survive.

Morrell said the pressure McCrery applied to Camden was so great it bruised one lung and the base of his skull.

McCrery's son and brother both told her during remarks to the court that they love and forgive her.

Her
 brother, Chris Hughes, asked Superior Court Judge Tina Nadeau to 
shorten the sentence a bit so her other son 23-year-old Ian McCrery, "might 
possibly have some time with her."

Judge Nadeau ignored the pleas and stuck with the 45-year sentence, adding, "There's nothing I can say here today to lessen the devastation."

Julianne
 McCrery thanked a family from South Berwick, Maine, for discovering 
Camden's body and later starting a children's charity in his memory.

She called them "angels on earth" for trying to bring some comfort to her son.

Lisa
 Gove was en route to her in-laws' house on a remote road on May 14 when
 she noticed a pickup truck with its doors open, bearing a Navy 
insignia.

She and her in-laws later discovered his body, which was under a green blanket 30 feet from the road.

Gove's
 detailed description of the truck and the Navy insignia led a driver at
 a Chelmsford truck stop to spot McCrery's truck on May 18 with 
her inside.

When she was 
questioned, McCrery identified herself and told police she had killed 
her son at a Hampton motel and left his body under a green blanket by 
the side of the road.

"Life as I knew it ended May 18, 2011," her mother, Lu Rae McCrery, told the judge on Friday.

"Camden's life, I believe, was taken in a misguided moment. We will never be whole again."

Lu
 Rae McCrery said after court that she had at least one phone 
conversation with her daughter but had no idea she had left Texas with 
Camden and had driven to New England.

Without Gove's chance observation, Morrell said, "it was highly unlikely he would have been found."

Julianne McCrery said it has taken a while for her grief to fully unfold, but now it is "excruciating."

Texas
 public records show that she was arrested at least twice on 
prostitution charges and once for possession with intent to distribute 
drugs.

In 2009, she was sentenced to one year in prison for a misdemeanor conviction of prostitution.

In 2004, she was sentenced to three years of probation for a felony conviction of possession of a controlled substance.

The wooded location where the body was found wrapped in a
 blanket is now a memorial, with flowers, teddy bears and other items 
left as a remembrance to the boy.
