After Apple announced the super-thin iPad Air, it was only a matter of time before the firm was able to produce a streamlined phone to match.

During last night’s event, Apple was keen to promote this fact, by showing off how much thinner its latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets are compared to previous models.

So keen, in fact, they appear to have used a bit of photo trickery to make the devices even narrower than they actually are.

Slimline tonic: The iPhone 6 (centre) is 6.9mm thick, and the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured right) is 7.1mm. By comparison, the iPhone 5S (left) is 7.6mm. During the presentation, when the devices were shown on the big screen they appeared thinner than they really are. The outer line shows the actual thickness, the inner line shows how they appear

The illusion was first spotted by digital news website Quartz.

The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm. By comparison, the iPhone 5S is 7.6mm, and the 5C is 8.97mm.

Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.1mm.

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches 5.75mm.

By comparison, Apple's iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm. 

The current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 8.1mm thick, and the HTC One M8 is 9.4mm.

This means the iPhone 6 is 9.2 per cent thinner than the iPhone 5S, and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7 per cent more slender.

However, during last night's presentation, the devices were shown on a screen that made them appear even smaller than this.

This was achieved by lighting the side of the phones straight on, and creating shadows on the curved edges.

These shadows then blended into the background of the slide, making the phones both look approximately 5mm in width.

If this was the accurate width, it would make the devices 34.2 per cent and 29.5 per cent thinner than the 5S.
