Schalke have signed Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic on loan until the end of the season.

The centre-back has moved initially on loan but the German club announced a fee has been agreed for a permanent deal, should they wish to take up the option.

Nastasic has been frozen out of the City fold. He has featured in only one game for Pellegrini’s side, this campaign, in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal back in August.

Nastasic moves to Schalke initially on loan with a view to a permanent deal in the summer

He was signed by then City manager Roberto Mancini from Fiorentina in August 2012.

The 21-year-old had been attracting Premier League interest from Tottenham and Arsenal but has now opted to move to the Bundesliga.

Roberto Di Matteo's side, who are currently fifth in the Bundesliga table will be hoping his Premier League experience will bolster their ranks.
