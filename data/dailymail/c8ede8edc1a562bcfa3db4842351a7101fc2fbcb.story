An Iraq war vet with post traumatic stress disorder has gone on a deadly gun rampage in an apartment complex - killing one elderly neighbour and critically wounding the dead man's wife.

The shooter - identified as Ricardo Javier Tapia, 32 - started spraying bullets around the residential complex while banging on doors and ranting about Barack Obama and Adolf Hitler, residents claim.

Several of the rounds hit an elderly couple, fatally wounding a man in his 70s and his wife, according to Los Angeles Police.

The pensioner was declared dead at the scene while his wife was rushed to hospital where she remains in a critical condition.

Police were called to the apartment at 6.40pm, on Friday, in the 7200 block of Canby Avenue in Reseda, Los Angeles.

Tapia, who apparently lives in the apartment complex, was spotted shirtless and covered in blood when police arrived. He then charged at officers with his hands up, an eyewitness claims.

Police eventually had to Tazer Tapia after failing to subdue him.

'I heard [the suspect] saying Hitler, Obama, and...terrorists and cops just got all over him. He was just fighting the whole way,' witness Erik Correa told ABC 7.

'I heard a gun shooting, and then I saw him - he was upstairs and he was just screaming and then he was all red and bloody,' said neighbor Amy Cobangbang.

A neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, told ABC 7 news the suspect was in his apartment and allegedly heard a thump.

She said: 'I guess that thump triggered everything else and he figured the house was under attack.'

Detectives are still investigating what may have sparked the gun rampage and are examining claims the suspect was behaving erratically and shouting random comments before the incident.

It is understood Tapia's wife is the manager of the apartment complex. She is pregnant with their second child. Tapia is being held on $1 million bail.
