Manchester City are offering free coach travel to fans travelling to Crystal Palace for their Bank Holiday Monday clash.

The match kicks off at 8pm in the capital, meaning supporters would have no chance of getting back to Manchester on the train following the game.

As a result, the Premier League champions have stepped in and are putting on transport themselves, free of charge.

City have been given 2,500 tickets for the televised clash at Selhurst Park on Easter Monday.

However, sections of the club's support had threatened to boycott the match in protest at what they believe to be inconsiderate scheduling.

A statement on the club's website reads: 'To thank fans for their unwavering support throughout the season, we are pleased to announce we will be offering free round-trip coach travel for our Easter Monday fixture against Crystal Palace on 6 April, which kicks-off at 8pm.

City fans would be unable to watch the entire match and then catch a train home to Manchester

'With the end of the season rapidly approaching, this game is sure to be a memorable one and you’re not going to want to miss it.'

In September, City officials slashed ticket prices by 50 per cent for their trip to Arsenal.

Travelling fans were set to be charged £64.00 for an adult ticket, while over-65 seats were priced at £27.25 and the under-16 bracket was set at £24.00.

City, however, subsidised the prices for season-ticket holders by 50 per cent meaning they were charged £32 for an adult ticket, £13.62 for an over 65 ticket and £12 for a junior ticket.
