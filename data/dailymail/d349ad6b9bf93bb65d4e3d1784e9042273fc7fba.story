Worcestershire's academy director Damian D'Oliveira has died at the age of 53, the county have confirmed.

D'Oliveira, the son of Worcestershire and England legend Basil D'Oliveira, had been battling cancer for the last two and a half years.

A statement on the county's official 
website read: 'The players were informed of the news of his death 
shortly before the start of today's [June 29] LV= County Championship 
match with Glamorgan at New Road.

'He leaves his wife Tracey and two other children in Marcus and Dominic.'

D'Oliveira played for Worcestershire between 1982 and 1995 and scored more than 9,000 first-class runs.

In
 his capacity as academy director he had overseen the introduction of a 
number of talented players into the first team at New Road, including 
his son Brett.

D'Oliveira's father Basil passed away at the age of 80 in November 2011 after a long battle against Parkinson's disease.

Born in 
South Africa, Basil D'Oliveira - or 'Dolly' as he was affectionately 
known - made headlines in 1968 when he was included in the England squad
 for the tour of his home country which had to be called off as the 
South African apartheid regime refused to accept his presence.

The incident marked the start of South Africa's sporting isolation. Basil D'Oliveira played for Worcestershire between 1964 and 1980.

Former Worcestershire chairman Duncan 
Fearnley says the memory of the academy director, who has died at the 
age of 53, will live on through the many players he brought through the 
club's youth ranks.

Speaking as former team-mates gathered for the county's old players' day, Fearnley explained how Damian had given his life to cricket and to Worcestershire.

'He had a good career here, he loved this club like his dad did,' Fearnley said.

'His name will live on through the players out there now in the first team as many of them came through the academy he was in charge of.

'They have all come through the ranks together.'
