British drinking pails away in comparison with the average drinker in the UK sinking just 2.3 shots in a week.

South Korea’s unparalleled liquor consumption is almost entirely down to the country’s love for the fermented rice spirit Soju. The South Korean liquor accounts for 97 per cent of the country’s spirits market, according to Quartz.

Hard drinking has become a growing issue in South Korea forcing the government to launch a marketing campaign to reign in its citizens' boozing.

'Almost every night in almost every police station lockup in Seoul, 
drunken men - and sometimes women - can be found abusing officers 
verbally and even physically, as a widely tolerated way of banishing 
anger,' reported the New York Times in 2012.

'They usually are allowed to sleep it off and go home, their 
punishment no more than a small fine.'

'A problem with the way South Koreans drink is that they drink fast to get drunk fast,' an official at the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation told the paper.

Many South Koreans, who work some of the 
longest hours in the world, believe that one of the quickest ways of 
building friendship and office camaraderie is to get drunk together, the
 Times' report added.

There, 'he who drinks more works better' 
is a common saying, and the working person’s drink of choice is often 
“the bomb,” a shot glass of soju added to a glass of beer.

The concoction is then downed in unison by all around the table to shouts of “One shot!” or “Bottoms up!”

Down and out: Of 44 countries studied by Euromonitor, The Russians were the second hardest drinkers at 6.3 shots per week. Vodka is the country's favourite tipple which no doubt contributed to this Russian Santa's early bedtime on a Moscow subway train

Shot happy: Despite Britain's international reputation for heavy drinking, the UK was only the 20th heaviest drinking nation when it came to shots

However, while the South Koreans are the heaviest drinkers when it comes to hard liquor, they are 13th heaviest drinkers overall, according to the World Health Organisation.

A 
Korean Alcohol Research Foundation survey in 2010 found that about 44 
percent of college students said they had experienced blackouts from 
excessive drinking.
