Here’s one home Santa will have no trouble spotting from his airborne sleigh. In fact, with more than 200,000 lights aglow, you can barely see the house at all.

The decorations take Alex Goodhind, 30, five weeks to put up and add around £1,000 to the electricity bill at his home in Melksham, Wiltshire.

But with the goodwill of his neighbours and visitors, he has used the impressive collection to raise around £15,000 over the years for a local hospice, Dorothy House, which treated his mother.

Wonder: The amazing Christmas lights display in Melksham, Wiltshire, attracts hundreds of visitors every year

Mr Goodhind uses 1,900ft of electric cable for the display of lights, which have been collected for over a decade, as well as 70 waterproof connection boxes, 2,000 cable ties and 650ft of steel restraining wire. However, this year’s show could be the last. His father Colin said: ‘There’s so much work that goes into it that Alex feels it could be his last year. He takes time off work to do it all, working all day on it for five weeks. It’s such a big job. All the neighbours are very supportive.’

The lights usually go on every day at 5.30pm and off at 10pm ‘out of respect to his neighbours’.

His father Colin said 'Alex does it to help the hospice that looked after his mum. There's a sizeable electricity bill afterwards  but it's all worth it'

Magical: Mr Goodhind has spent more than £30,000 on his annual lights display over the last 17 years 

 Mr Goodhind, 30, is one of a number of residents on Longford Road in Melksham, Wiltshire, who decorate their houses for Christmas – often for charity.

Speaking two years ago his neighbour Margaret Escott, 69, said: 'We do ours for the air ambulance as it is nice to give something back to the community.

'I think you could see Alex's display from space, there is not a part of that house which isn't covered in lights.'

After raising £4,000 for the Dorothy House Hospice in 2009, Mr Goodhind took a two year break before reigniting the tradition in 2012.

Every year the electrician spends weeks meticulously creating what is now Britain's biggest Christmas lights display

With more than 200,000 lights hanging from his home and positioned around his garden, Mr Goodhind faces a whopping £1,000 electricity bill by the time the festive season rolls to an end

Despite the coachloads of visitors who flock to the suburban street to catch a glimpse of his display, he claims most neighbours are supportive of his decision to switch on the lights once again. 

In 2012 he said: 'Some of the neighbours might have been glad when we stopped, but I wanted to do it again, for Dorothy House. 

'My mum was in there before she died, so I've always been keen to stick with them. 

Mr Goodhind has previously had to pay Southern Electricity a considerable sum to lay an industrial strength cable to his home to cope with the drain caused by the display. 

The lights go on every day from 5.30pm and Mr Goodhind has them switched off at 10pm ‘out of respect to his neighbours’.
