David Cameron's kitchen counter admission that he will not run for a third term as Prime Minister has raised more questions than answers.

But before we get to the nitty gritty of who will take over in 2020 - should Mr Cameron be re-elected in May - there is a far more pressing question to answer: Is his kitchen better than those of his political competitors?

Ed Miliband was the first to welcome  cameras into his kitchen, and since then Nicola Sturgeon and the PM have both invited TV crews to snoop around the pantries of power.

David Cameron's kitchen at his Oxfordshire home is bright and airy, with plenty of room to prepare meals

Ed Miliband's 'functional kitchenette' seems dingy and less homely in comparison to the Prime Minister's

Equipped with a hob, two ovens and a sink, the Miliband's second kitchen is said to be where they make 'tea and quick snacks'

Miliband, posing for a cup of tea with his wife Justine, lived to regret his photoshoot after it emerged that it was taken in the smaller of his two kitchens.

The Labour leader insisted he preferred his 'functional kitchenette' - complete with a hob, two ovens and a sink - while a family friend revealed it was mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'.

The bland room, painted white with a grey floor, seems cold and rather dingy compared to the kitchens at the Prime Minister's two homes.

While many were listening intently to Mr Cameron's revelation that he will not run for Britain's highest office come 2020, others were busy taking note of his family-sized kitchen at his Oxfordshire home.

His practical kitchen includes a large worktop, which the Prime Minister used to chop up vegetables with BBC deputy political editor James Landale, as well as mod cons such as a blender and an ice-dispensing fridge-freezer.

Showing the Tory leader's sense of humour, some viewers of his bombshell interview may have spotted a red 'Calm Down Dear' chopping board on the windowsill - a reference to when he landed himself in hot water by using the remark on Labour's Angela Eagle in the Commons.

David Cameron was pictured cutting up tomatoes in his kitchen, while another red chopping board with the phrase 'Calm Down Dear' can just about be seen in the windowsill

The Prime Minister was also seen in his smart kitchen chopping tomatoes while chatting to BBC deputy political editor James Landale

The Camerons' Downing Street kitchen is fully-stocked with food - as well as at least two bottles of wine

The Camerons' kitchen in Downing Street was also fully-stocked when cameras were allowed in earlier this month, with wine bottles visible in the fridge and on the kitchen counter, next to a loaf of bread. 

Even Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the SNP, has had TV crews inside her house.

Susanna Reid remarked that the First Minister's spotless house looked like a 'show home' as she sipped on a brew fresh from Ms Sturgeon's coffee machine.

Reid told her: 'We are in your lovely home now... It's immaculate.'

Ms Sturgeon replied: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning it. It's not always this tidy.'

In one recent interview David Cameron was seen preparing dinner, but the best Ms Sturgeon could do was make a coffee.

'I've never been very good in the kitchen,' she admitted.

'I like Indian takeaway,' she said, before joking: 'The fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a Friday night shouldn't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle.'
