The discovery of a headless torso on the Malaysian island of Penang has sparked fears that there may be a serial killer on the loose in the former British colony.

The murder victim, believed to be a woman, is the forty-sixth to be found on the island, a popular tourist destination, this year.

The decapitated body was stuffed in a suitcase that was dumped near the island's Botanic Gardens on Thursday.

It comes just two days after another headless body - that of an Indonesian woman - was found floating in the sea off the coast of the island.

And on Friday two human legs were found in an area being used for landfills, according to local newspaper the Sunday Star.

Among the 46 victims discovered this year, 30 have been foreign nationals - 17 of whom were from Burma. It has prompted fears that the murderer is targetting foreigners.

Senior police called for calm on the Malaysian island as a special police task force was being set up to investigate the gruesome crimes.

Penang's police chief, Senior Deputy Commander Wira Abdul Rahim Hanafi, told the Sunday Star  that 'the situation is under control'. He also dismissed the idea that the killings could all have been carried out by one person. 

Many of the victims, who remain unidentified, have been found with their throats cut and wrapped in white cloth.

A number have been found dumped by the roadside in industrial areas of the island. 

Forensic scientists were examining the mutilated legs found in the landfill area.

DNA results are expected early this week and police hope to then discover if they are linked to the headless torso found in the suitcase near the Botanic Gardens.
