The BBC licence fee is outdated and could be abolished in as little as two years, BBC managers have been told.

John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which is looking at new ways to fund the broadcaster, has told executives it will ‘not survive’.

It could be axed at the next renewal of the BBC Charter in 2016, or if no alternative is agreed on, it may be kept for part of the next Charter period – which ends in 2026 – but no longer, he said.

The Tory MP has long been critical of the licence fee, but at a private meeting in parliament he made clear it imminently faces the chop. The licence fee has been set at £145.50 since 2010.

Mr Whittingdale told BBC bosses including James Harding, the director of news and current affairs, and Peter Horrocks, the head of the World Service: ‘I don’t think the licence fee will survive.

‘There are lots of people already debating the terms of funding models. That’s exactly what my committee is doing’.

After the meeting, Mr Whittingdale told the Mail that the licence fee was no longer a feasible model as so many people watch programmes online via iPlayer and do not have to pay.

The decision on when to replace it will be made by the Government after his cross-party committee present their recommendations in a report due out this Autumn. Suggestions include introducing a banded ‘TV tax’, or a subscription system.

However, Mr Whittingdale said the case for public funding ‘remains very strong’.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Support for the licence fee has risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and it remains the most popular way of funding the BBC.’

Yet a poll last year found that 49 per cent of the public want the licence fee abolished.
