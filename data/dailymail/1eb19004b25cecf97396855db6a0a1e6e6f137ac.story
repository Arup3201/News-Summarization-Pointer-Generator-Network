Phoenix Jones tried his best to replicate the actions of Superman and Spider-Man on the streets of Seattle until he ended up in handcuffs for allegedly assaulting several people with pepper spray.

But now the 'superhero', whose real name is Ben Fodor, has rivalled the best escape acts Marvel and DC Comics have to offer by avoiding being charged by officials over last month's incident.

Fodor, 23, who wears a black mask with yellow stripes and a bulging muscle bodysuit, will not have charges pressed against him because officials can’t find two of the people who were pepper sprayed.

Revealed: Phoenix Jones - real name Ben Fodor - who wears a black mask with yellow stripes and a bulging muscle bodysuit, will not have charges pressed against him in Seattle, Washington

This means it would be difficult to 
convince any jury that he intentionally sprayed everyone at
the scene, City Attorney Pete Holmes said.

The case was further complicated by 
Fodor's explanation because state law lets people use force when he or 
she reasonably believes someone is about to be injured, Mr Holmes added.

The wannabe hero, who patrols the 
streets of Seattle fighting crime, dramatically removed his mask to 
speak to reporters at a court hearing last month.

He was accused of pepper spraying a 
group of people as they left a nightclub, but said he was trying to 
break up a fight when he was attacked.

Fodor appeared in a court last month 
wearing a grey mask and a superhero costume beneath a striped shirt. He 
briefly removed the mask during proceedings, when asked to by a court 
official.

'In addition to being Phoenix Jones, I
am also Ben Fodor, father and brother. I am just like everybody else. 
The only difference is that I try to stop crime in my neighborhood and 
everywhere else'

But he then dramatically removed it 
again outside court to reveal his true identity. Fodor vowed he would be
back out fighting evil on the streets straight after he was released.

'I will continue to patrol with my team, probably tonight,' he said last month, reported the Seattle Times.

'In addition to being Phoenix Jones, I
am also Ben Fodor, father and brother. I am just like everybody else. 
The only difference is that I try to stop crime in my neighborhood and 
everywhere else.'

'I think I have to look toward the future and see what I can do to help the city.’

Seattle police spokesman Detective 
Mark Jamieson said in October: ‘Our message has been the same from the 
beginning, if you see something that warrants calling 911, call 911.

'Just because he's dressed up in 
costume, it doesn't mean he's in special consideration or above the law.
You can't go around pepper spraying people because you think they are 
fighting.'

But Fodor, who wears a black mask with
yellow stripes and a bulging muscle bodysuit, said he was only trying 
to stop a street brawl.

Fodor wrote on his Facebook page that 
he wouldn't 'ever assault or hurt another person if they were not 
causing harm to another human being'. He also released a video shot 
during the alleged assault.

The often shaky video shows Fodor and 
his sidekick, known as Ghost, running toward a group of people. Fodor 
said there was a fight in the group. Police said there's no indication 
there was a fight.

The footage goes on to show Fodor 
breaking up the group. Then a woman screams at him, hitting him with her
high-heel shoes. Fodor appears to be holding his pepper spray canister.

Moments later a BMW car appears and 
speeds away on the street, almost hitting an unidentified man. Fodor 
chases after the car to get the license number.

A person with Fodor is heard calling 
911 to report a hit-and-run. Fodor and his followers then approach the 
rest of the group down the block.

A woman screams at them to 'stay 
away.' Another woman runs up to Fodor and hits him, screaming at him, 
'You sprayed (expletive) pepper spray in my eye!'

Two men in the group approach Fodor, who then appears to pepper spray them.

Fodor has been the most public face of
a group of vigilante crime stoppers to show up in Seattle in the last 
couple of years. His exploits have garnered much media attention in 
recent months.
