A company offering  Harry Potter live role-play experiences is set to buy a castle in Poland.

In April, the College of Wizardry will rent out a stunning castle in Czocha, Poland, so that Harry Potter fans can dress up as their favourite characters and enjoy a four-day adventure.

After the first experience sold out in just 90 seconds, the company behind the fan event has now announced it wants to buy a castle to be able to host more experiences throughout the year.

The project coordinator for the College of Wizardry hopes to raise enough money to buy a Polish castle and continue the Harry Potter role-playing days

This year's role-playing festival in Poland sold out in just 90 seconds as people from all over the world come together to celebrate Harry Potter

Up to 200 fans will join together in April to recreate their favourite scenes from the popular book and film series after paying around £220 for the trip.

The Live Action Role Playing festival (LARP) is run via a collaboration between Danish company Rollespilsfabrikken and Polish organisation Liveform, both not-for-profit organisations. 

Project coordinator of the College of Wizardry Claus Raasted announced the ambitious plans to raise enough money to buy a castle on a crowdfunding website.

'If we raise more money, we can do more events, Raasted told MailOnline Travel. 

'And if we manage to raise one million dollars, then we'll buy our own castle in Poland. That's the dream.'

Raasted and his team of volunteers from Liveform and Rollespilsfabrikken are creating an original story world for College of Wizardry to take place in, and are launching an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign with the aim of creating more larp events. 

While the two April events are set in the Harry Potter world by agreement with Warner Bros, the future will see Raasted and co develop their own story world and host 'wizard school events.'

Students will get to test out some potions, under the watchful eye of their professors

The modest goal is to raise at least $50,000. The campaign goes live on February 23. 

Enrollment at the College of Wizardry opened on December 1, 2014, with sessions in April selling out in just 90 seconds.

Mixing potions, discovering the woodland and even broomstick practice (though that won't involve going airborne) are all part of the mystical stayover.

Harry Potter fans can act out their fantasies by attending Poland's version of Hogwarts

Broomstick training, plus a bit of game playing, will take place in the playground

Attendees will be given a school robe and a book. The rules are fairly simple - the majority of LARP players are students, and so are expected to behave appropriately as you would at any school.

There are also a number of staff roles up for grabs - including the professors, the groundskeeper and the janitors.

The professors will be expected to lecture, the groundskeeper is responsible for the woods around the castle and the janitors run the school, they are the law and their word is final. 

A number of roles are filled at the role-playing festival, including the important role of the professors

It's hard work reaching the levels expected as a student at Hogwarts

There are  players from all over Europe, with Scandinavian fans historically making up a large number.

But obviously the main attraction is the playground - hidden passageways, a room of mirrors, a tower, dungeons and cellars, great halls and dark hallways ensure, just like the young wizard does at Hogwarts.

Just be careful you don't bump into He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
