A Kentucky mother who was reported missing when she failed to pick up her child from school on Friday was found three days later, locked alive in the trunk of her daughter's car. 

Aundrea Stone, 44, of Louisville was last seen at the Jay's Food Mart  in Okolona, but when she got back into her car she found another man inside who reportedly forced her to drive around Kentucky and Indiana for a few days.  

A Good Samaritan named Tiasha Chaplin rescued her Monday afternoon after hearing a thumping sound and a woman's voice coming from Stone's green Mazda, parked in a downtown Louisville lot. 

Found: Aundrea Stone was reported missing when she didn't show up to pick her daughter up from school on Friday. Three days later, she was found alive in the trunk of her daughter's car 

Imprisoned: Stone allegedly doesn't remember much from her three days missing, but was able to tell police that a white man in his 30s forced her to drive around Kentucky and Indiana 

'We (were) walking passed a car and heard a 'thump, thump.' We thought it was a prank,' Chaplin told WLKY.

Chaplin initially called 911 but when she passed by the car again and heard the noises getting louder, she decided to act. 

The woman broke a window of the car to pop the trunk and found a barely conscious Stone inside. 

Stone was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her for dehydration, at least one broken arm and head trauma. However, they don't believe she was in the trunk for more than a few hours.

Horrifying: Inside, Chaplin found Stone barely conscious. The woman was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her for dehydration and at least one broken arm 

So far, Stone hasn't been able to tell police much about her captor, describing him simply as an armed white man in his 30s who was wearing a hoodie and looked 'scraggly'. Local police say she remembers little from her three days missing. 

When Stone was taken to the hospital, she allegedly kept saying 'He hurt me, he hurt me' repeatedly, her pastor Carl Fletcher said. 

'She's dealing with some slight trauma but she's alive and she's gonna recover from everything that's happened to her,' Fletcher added.

Stone has been able to see her family while recovering, and may be released from University Hospital as early as Wednesday. 

Louisville police spokesman Dwight Mitchell also explained why police didn't open the trunk themselves when initially called to the scene. 

'When the first officer came there, was there about 15 minutes. He checked the car thoroughly, ran the plates did not hear anything at that point and subsequently had cleared the scene,' Mitchell said in a press conference.
