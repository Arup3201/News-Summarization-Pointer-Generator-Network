Connecticut highway cleanup crews had nothing to celebrate Wednesday when a tractor trailer crashed, spilling a mountain of pricey champagne.

Around 2:15pm, the truck tipped over after smashing into a Department of Transportation vehicle and dumping hundreds of cases of Veuve Clicquot across I-395.

The bright yellow cases, valued at $500 each, held up travelers in Griswold well into the evening as crews scrambled to clean up the bubbly mess.

Pricey: Hundreds of cases of Veuve-Clicquot spilled across highway I-395 in Connecticut on Wednesday

According to the Norwich Bulletin, the driver William Wronski, 56, failed to merge ahead of a construction zone. When his lane ended, he smashed in to the back end of a parked DOT truck.

Wronski was relatively unscathed, but his truck toppled onto a hillside as the French champagne, which goes for about $40 per bottle, smashed and sprayed its way across the highway.

Crews were removing trees in the area and were saved, despite the trucker’s inattention, because the DOT truck was outfitted with cushioning in order to protect them.

At least one man tried to make the best of traffic holdup when he scaled a hill for a closer look, or perhaps taste.

Pricy mistake: The truck carrying the $500 cases smashed into a Department of Transportation vehicle after the driver failed to heed construction signs

Big job: The cleanup required a small bulldozer and took hours. The driver of the truck, 56-year-old William Wronski was treated for minor injuries, as was the driver of the DOT vehicle

The man failed, though, when he slipped down a slope and tumbled to the closed-down highway with a thud.

Emergency workers were already there and bandaged the man’s hand and elbow.

It even took a bulldozer to scoop up the broken glass and wine-soaked cardboard.

Traffic in one lane opened around 5pm, reported WFSB, but two hours after the crash cleanup continued into the evening with a tow truck finally arriving after 7pm to haul away the totalled 18-wheeler.

Pile up: Traffic was held up for hours and crews were still cleaning up the 2:15pm crash after 7pm, when a tow truck arrived to haul away the 18-wheeler

Popular: A Dumpster was on scene to hold the smashed glass and soaked cardboard. Veuve-Clicquot, which retails for around $40 per bottle, is easily recognizable for its bright yellow label

Both Wronski and James Tuttle, who was behind the wheel of the parked vehicle, were treated for minor injuries at the scene and taken to an area hospital as a precaution.

One of the most famous brands of champagne worldwide, Veueve Clicquot is instantly recognizable by millions for its bright yellow label, though other bottles—many of them far more expensive—do exist.

According to c TheDay.com,hampagne was collected by the Department of Consumer Protection.
