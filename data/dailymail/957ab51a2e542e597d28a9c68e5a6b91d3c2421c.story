Jackiey Budden, 56, mother of Big Brother star Jade Goody, has caused a sex abuse trail to be restarted after complaining about a fellow juror who was chewing gum and taking her shoes off during evidence

Jade Goody's mother has been removed from jury duty after complaining about a fellow juror.

Jackiey Budden, 56, wrote a letter to the judge at Blackfriars Crown Court after becoming annoyed by a young woman chewing gum, flicking her hair, and taking her shoes off during the trial.

However after the note was passed on the judge dismissed the jury, causing the sex assault trail they were sitting on to be restarted.

The other jurors were all reselected to sit on other cases, with the exception of Ms Budden.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she said: 'Before we went into court we were told if we felt uncomfortable about anything we had to write a letter to the judge.

'Being on a jury was something I treated seriously. I was listening to everything and making notes. But I was sitting next to this woman who wasn't showing any interest.

'She kept kicking off her shoes, huffing and puffing, tossing her head and chewing gum.'

Before the second day of the trial Ms Budden passed the note of complaint to the judge.

After dismissing the jury, Ms Budden said she was given the option of sitting on another jury or going home.

She arrived court the following day on January 28 expecting to be selected, but again wasn't called.

Ms Budden caused controversy in 2010 when she was discovered selling teddy bears that had been left on her daughter's grave for 50p each

Ms Budden, from Bermondsey, added that she didn't think she would be eligible for jury duty because she has previous convictions, and the serving on a jury had made her feel proud.

She says she has no idea what she did wrong, or why she wasn't reselected.

The Ministry of Justice confirmed that Jackiey had been removed from duty.

The judge at Blackfriars Crown Court dismissed the jury after he was passed a note by Ms Budden

It is not the first time the mother of Big Brother contestant Jade, who died in 2009 from cervical cancer, has courted controversy.

In 2010 Jackiey was discovered selling teddy bears placed on her daughter's grave for 50p, and was alleged to have sold soft toys belonging to Jade's children as well as Jade's possessions.
