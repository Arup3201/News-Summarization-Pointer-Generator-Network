Mauro Icardi and Wanda Nara's controversial relationship reached a new level on Tuesday as the couple married in Buenos Aires.

Nara (or Icardi as she will now be called) is the ex-wife of Maxi Lopez, but publicly split from the Argentine to hook up with compatriot and Inter Milan striker Icardi in November 2013.

Icardi and Lopez famously clashed during a Serie A game between Sampdoria and the Nerazzurri in April, with the latter refusing to shake the 21-year-old's hand.

Where is the love? Wanda Nara revealed in an interview that he marriage with Maxi Lopez was failing apart

The wedding took place by civil union and was in front of only 12 invited guests, with the groom in jeans. Unsurprisingly, Lopez wasn't one of them.

The former Barcelona forward looked after Icardi when he first came to Italy and the pair spent lots of time together and with Lopez's then wife Nara, as well as the couple's three children.

The love triangle between the two players and Argentinian WAG Nara was exposed in November 2013 when it was revealed Icardi had made moves on his former friend's wife as their marriage fell apart.

The Inter Milan forward took to Twitter to declare: 'I love you [Wanda Nara], it will never be easy to say what I feel, 
because I discovered that those two words ('I love you' = 'te amo' in Spanish) 
carry with them one feeling without limits!'

The tweet coincided with an interview given by Nara released by Revista People, in which the model revealed: 'It’s been three months since my husband had sex. Maxi has neglected me. 
Although I’ve been living in luxury, I am also living with hidden pain.

'I think 
the time has passed for me to save my family. I will not fight for the money, 
because he knows me.'

The pair have since become renowned 
for posting almost daily declarations of their love over social media as
 well as numerous 'selfie' pictures.

But, it is pictures of a different kind that have angered her husband after Lopez hit out this week at the couple for putting up Twitter images featuring the two children he fathered with Nara.

'I can understand that, being a public figure, he publishes photos. But I'm not comfortable with my kids being in those photos,' Lopez said to Sky Sport.

He added: 'The kids are my strength... and they know I will do everything to protect them because they mean everything to me.'
