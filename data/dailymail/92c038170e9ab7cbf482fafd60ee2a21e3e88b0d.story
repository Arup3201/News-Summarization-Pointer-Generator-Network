Kendall Jenner has made her official debut as the new face of Estee Lauder, starring in a striking video campaign for the brand's newest product release, the Little Black Primer. 

The 19-year-old reality star turned fashion icon, who first revealed that she had been signed up by the beauty brand in November last year, posted a clip of the black and white ad on her Instagram account earlier today, amassing more than 220,000 likes in just two hours.

In the video, Kendall showcases her best model strut, striding across the floor towards the camera with complete confidence, and proving exactly why so many fashion houses are falling over themselves in order to cast her in their catwalk shows.

Estée Lauder's new video ad also offers a fair few close ups of Kendall's face, focusing on her lengthy eyelashes - which are no doubt the result of the brand's new product release, a primer for your lashes which claims to 'amplify volume and length'.

The primer, which can be worn with or without mascara, offers users the chance to add a bit of a boost to their lashes, without making it too obvious that they are wearing make-up. 

As a long-time fan of the more fresh-faced beauty look, Kendall was no doubt an obvious choice for Estée Lauder when it came to choosing who would front the new release. 

'I've always been really into my eyelashes, so this is a fun product for me,' Kendall said in a statement released alongside the video campaign.

'While I usually love a lot of mascara, sometimes I don't want to wear too much makeup, but I still want a little definition. 

'It's cool that you can use [the primer] just for tinting and it doesn't look like you have too much makeup on.' 

The video has thus far received an overwhelmingly positive response on social media, with many beauty lovers taking to Twitter and Instagram in order to show their support for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star. 

Momager Kris Jenner was one of the first to compliment her daughter on the campaign, posting the video on her Instagram and commenting: 'So proud of my girl @KendallJenner!!! 

'Love this for @esteelauder #LittleBlackPrimer #EsteeLauder #proudmama #gorgeous'

As one of the most effortlessly stylish members of the Kardashian clan, Kendall is making quite a name for herself in her Jenner-ation as a style icon to be in awe of.

The 19-year-old catwalk strutter appears to put in the minimal amount of elbow grease when it comes to assembling outfits, and is a creature of habit in terms of her go-to staples such as khaki bomber jackets, skinny jeans and ankle boots.

A particular fan of the skinny jean style (can you blame her with those legs?), Kendall likes to mix it up a little but often goes for black; seen here in a pair of Hudson ribbed knee jeans which flatter her slimline figure to the max.

And you can kopy Kendall's style with these slick skinnies, now available at Revolve Clothing with a click to the right,  or simply take a gander at our ribbed knee jeans below if you can't find your size.

We'll be styling ours with chunky roll necks and our favorite suede ankle boots for ultimate autumn/winter vibes.

One fan praised the young model for embracing her natural beauty, saying: 'I love how natural Kendall Jenner is.'

Another added: 'I like that you are all natural! You're the only one in your family that didn't have any surgeries! 

'You are successful because you are being yourself.' 

Upon announcing Kendall as its newest spokesperson, Estée Lauder released a behind-the-scenes video of her first photoshoot for the beauty brand, in which Kendall revealed her lifelong love of make-up.

'The first time I wore make-up, I was a little girl and my mom was filming me, and I'm like, "Mom, I did my make-up, do you like it?"' she explains of the clip.

She continues, clearly still in shock and awe: 'To think back to me being a young kid going through my mom's make-up drawer, playing with Estée Lauder, and flip to now and I'm a part of this family...'
