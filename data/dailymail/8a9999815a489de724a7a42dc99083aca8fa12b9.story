Mario Pasalic has joined Spanish club Elche on a season-long loan from Chelsea.

The 19-year-old midfielder, who was named in Croatia's provisional 30-man World Cup squad but did not make it to Brazil, joined Chelsea from Hajduk Split earlier this month but has been immediately sent out on loan.

Elche confirmed on their website that Pasalic has already passed his medical with the Primera Division club and begun training with his new team-mates.

Pasalic said at his official presentation on Tuesday: 'I wanted to play in La Liga and my coach (Jose) Mourinho thought the best thing for me was to come to Spain to play against big teams.

'I'm grateful for this opportunity with Elche. I've come here because I believe I can be an important player and help the club have a good season.'
