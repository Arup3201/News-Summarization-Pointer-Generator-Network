'We should get it wright': Lord Patten admitted the BBC review is a result of complaints of bias

A BBC review of ‘the breadth of opinion’ reflected in its coverage of immigration, religion and the EU was triggered by complaints of liberal bias, Lord Patten has admitted.

The BBC Trust chairman said the investigation had been ‘prompted’ by accusations that elements of the broadcaster’s news, current affairs and factual programming had been unbalanced.

The move could signal a greater range of voices and experts being included.

In a speech to the Broadcasting Press Guild, Lord Patten said: ‘It’s an acceptance that these are areas where people  are particularly concerned that we should get it right.

‘We’ve been criticised in those areas and we think it’s very important to listen to  that criticism, not necessarily because it’s right but because it reflects real and interesting concerns.’

The BBC has repeatedly been accused of taking a ‘pro-Europe’ approach to its coverage of issues facing the EU.

Similarly its reporting of immigration has been questioned, with some critics claiming it has tried to underplay the arguments against mass migration.

Even former director general Mark Thompson conceded that the BBC had been ‘reticent talking about immigration’.

The new review will be published in 2013 and will take in audience research and views from the industry, as well as analysing content of programmes.

BBC Trustee David Liddiment said: ‘The BBC’s reputation for and commitment to impartiality is part of its DNA.

'This review will help to ensure it continues to meet audience expectations in this area, looking at how the BBC builds an understanding of breadth of opinion into its approach to its journalism.

‘Part of the review will look at coverage of immigration, religion and the EU – not because we are anticipating a problem there, but because they are subjects on which there are obviously a range of opinions and which will make a valuable contribution to the review.’

The BBC Trust, the broadcaster’s governing body, conceded that if the review uncovered issues then it would lead to ‘behavioural change’ in programming.

Led by former ITV and Sky executive Stuart Prebble, the review will investigate whether the broadcaster is doing ‘all it can’ to ensure impartiality.

Mr Prebble will investigate whether decisions to ‘include or omit perspectives in news and current affairs coverage have been reasonable and carefully reached’.

He will also look at whether ‘due weight’ was given to a range of perspectives.

The new investigation will also ‘check up’ on the progress the BBC has made on the recommendations in a 2007 report which examined the impact of social and technological change on impartiality.

In a statement, the BBC Trust said: ‘The review will focus on the BBC’s news, current affairs and factual output.

‘The content analysis will include an analysis of the BBC’s coverage of immigration, religion and the EU, by comparing some coverage from 2007 with coverage from 2012/13.’

It insisted that views held by the minority should not necessarily be given the same weight as the ‘prevailing consensus’.

The review will assess phone-in interviews and user-generated content to see whether they are given ‘appropriate significance’ and whether the use of such material is balanced.

Recent reviews have examined issues including the corporation’s coverage of science and the Arab Spring.
