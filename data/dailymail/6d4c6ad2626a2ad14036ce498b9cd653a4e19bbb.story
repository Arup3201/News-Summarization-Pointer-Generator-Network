A cancer surgeon was found slumped at the wheel of his car with a half empty bottle of vodka on what would have been his 10th wedding anniversary - two years after losing his wife to the very disease he specialises in.

A passer-by found bowel cancer specialist Nicholas Harrison, of Coven, Staffordshire, slumped in his car parked on double-yellow lines with the engine running last month.

The 43-year-old lost his wife and mother-of-three Gemma Harrison to a neuroendocrine tumour of the bowel, a rare form of cancer which spread to her liver and lung. The 34-year-old died in August 2012, four months after she was diagnosed.

Cancer surgeon Nicholas Harrison was found slumped in his car on what would have been his 10th wedding anniversary. His wife Gemma Harrison, a mother-of-three, died two years ago from a form of the disease he specialises in

Police officers administered a breath test and found Harrison was more than three times the drink drive limit.

Magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard he was heartbroken after the death of his wife.

Harrison's lawyer Paul Kay told magistrates: 'This is an exceptional case with a tragic background. He had drunk to numb the pain of a tragic day.'

Now the 43-year-old surgeon at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire has been hit with a 12-month driving ban.

At an 
earlier hearing, Kay told the court: 'It would be a devastating blow to 
anybody, but he was a specialist in the very cancer she was suffering 
from.'

Mrs
 Harrison, a nurse who met her husband through work, had started organising a fund-raising event for the 
Royal Free Hospital in London where she was treated before she died.

Her
 friends and family set up a charity called Remember Gemma Always, which
 has raised £20,000 for the hospital, which specialises in 
neuroendocrine tumours.

Mrs Harrison's friend Sally Miles heads the charity. She said: 'We met through our children and clicked instantly, so watching her so poorly was hard.'

The charity's website states: 'Gemma’s relatives and friends want to remember her for her positive influence on so many lives and fulfil her desire to fund research into this rare cancer and provide support to both patients and their families suffering with this wicked illness.'

Mourner Louise Neale posted on a death notice in the Express and Star: 'Such a wonderful lady and a very special friend. You will always be in our hearts.'

Lee Wedge added: 'A beautiful woman who will be sadly missed by family and friends. Deeply saddened.'

The court also heard Harrison, a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was well-liked at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where he works. Hospital officials declined to comment on the case.

Neuroendocrine tumours are cancers that grow in hormone producing tissues, usually in the digestive system. They are rare.

The endocrine system is a network of glands and organs in the body that produce hormones.

The tumours usually develop slowly over a number of years. Many people don’t have symptoms at first.

It is not unusual for people to find that a neuroendocine cancer has already spread to another part of the body when they are diagnosed.

There is some debate among doctors about how neuroendocrine tumours should be grouped and what they should be called.

Although they develop from the same types of cell, they develop in different organs in the body. They also behave in different ways, for example some are slow growing while others are faster growing.Source: Cancer Research UK
