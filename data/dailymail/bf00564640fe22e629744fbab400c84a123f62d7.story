Margaret Thatcher's flagship Right to Buy scheme has been given a boost with the number of people buying their council houses doubling in a year.

Ten thousand tenants have purchased their properties since last year, the highest level since before the recession, after the government increased the discounts available.

Buyers are now able to get a discount of £75,000 - treble what they were getting in most parts of the country - and £100,000 off the price in London from this year, four times the previous rate.

David Cameron praised the opening up of home ownership to those previously locked out of the property market, and said the money raised would be ploughed into building more affordable homes.

New proposals expected to be made law by next year would further relax the rules, allowing tenants to buy their homes after living in them for just three years, rather than the current five.

Kris Hopkins, the new housing minister, said: 'For years the right to buy was allowed to wither on the vine, with ever-decreasing discounts leaving the prospect of home ownership out of reach for far too many social tenants.

'But our reinvigorated scheme has changed that, with increased discounts helping more than 10,000 new homeowners on to the property ladder.

'And because we've committed to using the additional money raised towards funding new affordable homes for rent, we're also getting Britain building and will soon have the fastest rate of affordable house-building for two decades.'

Since the discounts were increased in April last year 8,398 people took up the offer in the following 12 months.

Another 2,149 did so in April to June this year. The sales will generate £173million for local councils to use to build new houses.

Right to Buy, launched by Mrs Thatcher in 1980, changed the housing market forever, with round 2million social housing tenants buying their own homes since it began

Right to Buy, launched by Mrs Thatcher in 1980, changed the housing market forever, with round 2million social housing tenants buying their own homes since it began.

Michael Heseltine, then the housing minister, declared that 'no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people.'

It began offering vast discounts on the market value, but they have fallen in recent years from an average of 50 per cent in 1998-99 to just 24 per cent in 2008-9.

In London, where house prices rose 
most dramatically in the years before the economic crash, average 
discount fell from 53 per cent to just 10 per cent over the same decade.

David
Cameron said: 'The success of right-to-buy shows how the new 
reinvigorated scheme is opening up the prospect of home ownership to 
even more people across the country.

'With
over 10,000 people taking up the opportunity to buy their council home 
this year, the demand to make that step on to the housing ladder is 
clear.

'What is more, we're ploughing the additional money from right-to-buy sales straight back into building more affordable homes.'

This
week saw the launch of Help to Buy - in which working people who can 
afford mortgage payments but do not have a large deposit can put down 
just 5 per cent of its value, and have another 15 per cent guaranteed by
the government.

Both 
schemes have put a spotlight on the housing shortage - with 1.8million 
people on council lists waiting for a home, and building having slumped 
to a record low in recent years.
