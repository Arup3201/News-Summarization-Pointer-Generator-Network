West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace feels Albion's overhaul this summer has left them a much 'happier' and 'calmer' club.

Since finishing the 2013/14 Barclays Premier League season one place above the relegation zone, the Baggies have appointed Terry Burton as technical director, replaced head coach Pepe Mel with Alan Irvine and brought in 11 new players.

Two draws and a loss so far have amounted to a somewhat underwhelming start to their 2014/15 campaign, but Peace is pleased with the revamp that has occurred and is looking ahead in optimistic mood.

'It does seem a happier place, very much so,' said Peace, quoted on www.wba.co.uk.

'They all seem to be in quite a good place. The feedback to me has been very positive. Around the place people seem to be calmer.

'They are still hungry, they still want success. I don't think there will be a shortage of effort. They will give it their best shot.

Record: Nigerian international Brown Ideye joined West Brom in the summer for a club record £10million

'I think we've done well to do what we've done.

'At the start of the summer, we set our target to start the season with 22 players - 19 outfield and three goalkeepers.

'We ended up with 25 because we wanted to give our head coach as many options as possible. Two of the 'extras' are loan agreements so we are comfortable about that.

'We ended last season with 26 players, we lost 10 who were released, Billy Jones left, George Thorne has gone and we've recruited 11.

'January is a time when we re-assess depending on injuries and, this season, the potential for one or two players to be called away for the African Championships.

'But given the sheer volume I'm happy.'
