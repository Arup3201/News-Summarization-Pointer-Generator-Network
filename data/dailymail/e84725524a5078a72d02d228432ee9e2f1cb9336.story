The Independent Press Standards Organisation, whose chairman is Sir Alan Moses (pictured), will oversee editorial standards for the majority of national and regional newspapers and magazines

IPSO, the new Press regulator, begins work today with a commitment to be 'rigorous, independent, fair and transparent'.

The Independent Press Standards Organisation, whose chairman is the retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Alan Moses, will oversee editorial standards for the majority of national and regional newspapers and magazines, including the Daily Mail.

It has far tougher rules than the previous regulator, the Press Complaints Commission.

The watchdog will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing and can require editors to publish up-front corrections.

IPSO will also include a standards and compliance arm, with investigative powers to call editors to account.

It will require all newspapers to have their own effective complaints-handling procedures.

Yesterday, Sir Alan said: 'IPSO aims to help rebuild public trust in the Press through independent, fair and transparent regulation. Its role as an independent regulator is to provide support and redress for victims of Press abuse. To raise standards is to protect the public from abuse.

'The board and I believe that the freedom of the Press can best be maintained by supporting and enhancing standards through an independent regulator.

'To achieve that aim we are committed to establishing and demonstrating our independence. Where standards have been breached we will apply sanctions and seek redress. Where we see patterns of poor behaviour we will pursue change.

'Democracy depends on a free but fair Press. Through independent regulation IPSO will make an important contribution to that vital objective.'

IPSO said subscribing publications will be expected to deal fairly and swiftly with complaints from readers. It will also monitor the complaints handling procedures of its subscribing publications with expectations of clarity, efficiency, fairness and transparency.

 A majority of the 12 members of IPSO's complaints committee, expected to be confirmed today, will be from outside the industry. They are expected to include the former broadcaster and campaigner against miscarriages of justice David Jessel, Jill May of the Competition Commission, and Lara Fielden, vice-chairman of the London Probation Trust.

Among the industry members are expected to be Elisabeth Ribbans, former managing editor of the Guardian, and Peter Wright, Editor Emeritus of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.
