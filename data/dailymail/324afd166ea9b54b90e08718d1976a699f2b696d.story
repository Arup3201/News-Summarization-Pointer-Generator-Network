Stuck in a deckchair: Des Badcock, 82, was enjoying an ice cream in his garden in Taunton when the canvas seat on his chair suddenly gave way

A grandfather has revealed how he was forced to call 999 after becoming stuck in his deckchair.

Des Badcock, 82, who lives alone in Taunton, Somerset, was enjoying an ice cream in his garden when the canvas seat on his chair suddenly gave way.

He fell onto the grass as the chair collapsed around him and left him stuck with his feet dangling in the air. Mr Badcock found himself trapped by his bottom in the metal frame.

After more than half an hour in the glaring sunshine and with no-one around to help he pulled his mobile phone out of his pocket and called the fire brigade.

Some 20 minutes later two firemen arrived at his garden and hauled him back to his feet.

Grandfather-of-seven Mr Badcock, who was physically unhurt, said: ‘I was just sitting out in the garden in my deckchair after having an ice cream. It was a Cornetto from Lidl.

‘All of a sudden I went down and the chair was broken. I fell right through the chair and couldn't get out. My feet were suspended in the air. I live alone and the neighbours weren't in.

‘No matter what I did I couldn't get any purchase. I was there for half an hour. I thought “what am I going to do? I'm going to have to phone the fire brigade”.

‘I couldn't stay there much longer because I was starting to get sunburn. If I'd stuck around I would've been frazzled.’

Mr
 Badcock, who has lived alone since his wife Margaret died five years 
ago, added: ‘They took an arm each and heaved me out. It wasn't that 
hard really and they were gone again in a flash.

‘They
 said to me “are you injured?” I said “no, I'm just embarrassed”. 
Luckily the neighbours didn't see because they were at work.’

Another Cornetto: Mr Badcock was back out in his garden again yesterday - in a different deckchair

Mr Badcock, who works part time at Lidl, was fine apart from a sore shoulder and a little sunburn.

He was back out in his garden again yesterday - in a different deckchair. He said: ‘The fall hasn't put me off. I like getting out in the garden when I can.’

Watch commander Bill Williams, from Taunton fire station, said: ‘I would recommend ensuring your deckchair is in full working order before sitting down.

‘I can't think of a time I've ever been called out to something like this, but we do have cutting equipment that works on wooden deckchairs, as well as hydraulic tools for metal ones.’
