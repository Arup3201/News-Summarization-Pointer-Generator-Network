Five men, including four fraternity brothers, died in a fiery, head-on collision on a southwest Florida highway early this morning.

A Ford Expedition heading south in the northbound lanes of Interstate 275 in Tampa collided head-on with a Hyundai Sonata about 2am.

As the Ford burst into flames, killing the unidentified driver, the Hyundai's four young passengers succumbed to their injuries.

Due to extensive fire damage, officials are working to identify the male driver of the Ford who was in his early 20s.

Police have identified the victims in the other car as Jobin Joy Kuriakose, 21, Ankeet Harshad Patel, 22, Imtiyaz 'Jim' Ilias, 20 and Dammie Yesudhas, 21 - all members of University of South Florida's Sigma Beta Rho fraternity.

News of the horrific crash has rocked the close-knit fraternity, with condolences rolling in after Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity, Inc posted this touching message on the Facebook page:

'RIP to four of our brothers from Mu Chapter at USF in Tampa who we lost early this morning from a car crash. 

- Dammie Yesudhas, Brother Netflix - Imtiyaz Ilias, Brother Rodnac - Jobin Kuriakose, Brother Ambition- Ankeet Patel, Brother Facetious

'May you rest in peace and remain in remembrance. Please pray for the families.'

NBC 2 reported the death of young Ilias, a Cypress Lake High School graduate, has devastated the Cypress Lake community.

His former wrestling coach Paul Rothenberg said Ilias was one of the most determined kids on the team.

'Jim
 was an amazing guy. In everything, school, wrestling, he worked hard, 
had fun, was a pleasure to be around always entertaining Always wanted 
to joke,' he said.

The newspaper reported Ilias was only the second wrestler in school history to place in the state tournament twice - coming 6th in 2011 and 4th in 2012.

Yesudhas was an engineering intern at QTM Incorporated and was completing a Bachelor of Science and Mechanical Engineering at USF.

He
 had completed a Bachelor of Arts last year and was formerly the 
president of the university's chess club. He also loved playing a 
variety of sports, including basketball, tennis and volleyball.

Witness Crystal Fountain said she dodged the Ford SUV just moments before the crash.

'It was a car going directly at me in the same lane,' Fountain told Bay News 9.

'It was going straight, it was going fast, all I could think of was the car was on a death mission.'

Fountain said as soon as she swerved out of the way and the Ford SUV sped by, she looked in the side mirror and knew something terrible was about to happen.

'It’s just so painful and hurt that innocent people lost their lives and we still don’t know why or what the reason is,' she said.

Another witness captured the burning vehicle on camera, and she can be heard screaming as she drives past the crash site.

Authorities said they are investigating whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash.

The tragic news comes after six people, including a family of four, were killed in a head-on collision in California today.
