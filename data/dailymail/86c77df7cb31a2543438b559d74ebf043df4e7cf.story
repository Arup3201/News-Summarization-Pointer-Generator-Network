Edging his way into the frame, there was something very familiar - yet remarkably out of place - about this would-be athlete pictured with the Team GB men's indoor volleyball team.

Posing at the back - wearing a shirt, tie and blazer - David Cameron got into the Olympic spirit by squeezing into a photobooth with athletes Joel Miller, Jason Haldan and Nathan French.

The Prime Minister had been touring the Team GB preparation camp, which include a visit to the 'kitting out' centre at Loughborough University.

Mr Cameron had been meeting staff and athletes on last week's tour when he decided to get into the picture booth with the volleyball squad as they were trying on their new Stella McCartney-designed Team GB kit.

One of the athletes described described the moment he had his picture taken with the Prime Minister.

Nathan French said: 'We even got him in the photo booth. He didn't put 
any of the kit on, I think that might have been too much to ask.

'I was frantically trying to put on some Lycra what-not when he came in but it was all good fun.'

Joel Miller, 23, from Manchester, added: 'He said we were very tall, 
I've not heard that before, and he asked us about volleyball.'

Anthony Ogogo and members of the shooting team were also kitting out at
Loughborough on the same day the Prime Minister was there.

Mr Cameron also met members of the Team GB basketball team, including Chicago Bulls star Luol Deng as well as Londoners Dan Clark,
Eric Boateng and Pops Mensa-Bosu.

Best foot forward: David Cameron inspects a size 17 trainer during a visit to the Team GB preparation base

At one point Mr Cameron was seen inspecting a size 17 trainer - quite possibly destined for the foot of 
one Team GB's basketball players.

Deng said: 'It was great of the Prime Minister to visit and show his 
support for us. We really appreciate it and it means a lot to know that
we have the support of the Prime Minster and the nation.

'We talked about the fact that he went to a basketball game earlier 
this year with President Obama.Â  He told me President Obama is a fan, 
which is great.'
