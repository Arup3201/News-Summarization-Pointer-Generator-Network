London has a reputation for being a foggy city, but here’s a stunning reminder that Vancouver also gets a bit misty from time to time.

British ex-pat Alexis Birkill has taken mesmerising photographs showing the Canadian city carpeted in thick fog, with the city’s skyscrapers poking out above the clouds.

The stunning photographs were taken when fog lingered on the city for a week.

Stunning: Downtown Vancouver carpeted in fog during sunset by British ex-pat Alexis Birkill

Alexis says he made six trips to the spectacular viewpoint in order to capture the images taken last week

Precarious: Visibility was down to just 200 meters at the most in downtown Vancouver when the photographs were taken

They were captured by the 31-year-old, originally from Sheffield, Yorkshire, after he had scaled the nearby Cypress Provincial Park.

Mr Birkill said: ‘I ended up spending in the region of 12 to 14 hours, mostly standing around trying to keep warm.

‘When the conditions were finally right, it was almost magical to see the top of the city appear out of the fog, floating like an island.

‘As well as enjoying the sight, it's important to get the photos while you can, as the conditions can change in just a few minutes.’

The rare phenomenon was said to be caused by a temperature inversion.

Mr Birkill says he made six trips to the spectacular viewpoint in order to capture the images, taken last week. Alexis added: ‘Most of that time, visibility in downtown Vancouver was down to a couple of hundred metres at most.

‘Capturing these images was a very time-consuming and frustrating process as most of the time, the conditions were not correct.

‘Living in downtown Vancouver, it was almost impossible to get an idea of what the conditions would be like without going out to the viewpoint to check.

‘Unless you have access to a high floor of a high building, it's impossible to determine how far above the city the fog reaches.

‘But the reception the images have received meant it was all worthwhile.’
