When model of the moment Kendall Jenner made her video debut for beauty brand Estee Lauder, one thing that stood out most - other than the 19-year-old's confident catwalk strut - were her impressively lengthy lashes, which she took every opportunity to flutter at the camera. 

And rightly so, for Kendall is the face - or rather the eyes - of the beauty brand's newest 'must-have' eyelash launch, the Little Black Primer, a product which claims to give the wearer the same natural-looking length and volume as modeled by Kendall. 

But do the results live up to the brand's promise of 'silky black lashes' both day and night?

Length and volume: Estee Lauder's new Little Black Primer, as modeled by Kendall Jenner, promises to boost the wearer's eyelashes

The end result: While my lashes were not as natural-looking as Kendall's, the combination of primer and mascara did result in longer, thicker eyelashes than I would normally achieve with just mascara

According to Estee Lauder's description, the Little Black Primer can be worn  by itself, to give lashes a natural boost of 'color and lift', underneath mascara, to provide a 'base for volume, lift and length', or on top of mascara, as 'a long-wearing, water-resistant topcoat'.

My lashes are naturally very thin, straight and generally lacking when it comes to volume and length. In other words, I need all the help I can get when it comes to mascara. 

Even if that means taking the time to apply an additional coat of product in the mornings.If it can help me to achieve Kendall's impressive results, I'm on board.

So, I put Estee Lauder's claims to the test - trying out the primer in all of the three ways that the brand suggests it should be used. 

After first applying the Little Black Primer by itself, I didn't notice any major differences to my lashes.

While Estee Lauder describes the product as being 'tinted black' - the majority of other alternative eyelash primers are white - it looks like more of a dark grey to me. It certainly doesn't offer the same bold, black results that I'm used to from my mascara. 

Natural talent: The Little Black Primer promises natural-looking results and Estee Lauder claims it can be worn on its own, without the need for any mascara

Where's the flutter? After just applying a coat of the primer, it was difficult to see a real difference to my lash length, volume or color

Upon the closest of inspections, I do see an increase in definition, and a hint of added volume - but certainly nothing as impressive and fluttery as seen on Kendall. 

If you are lucky enough to be blessed with lengthier lashes than mine however - and you're in the market for an effortlessly natural eyelash look - this could well be just the product for you. 

Personally however, I'm looking for something a lot more obvious, results that make me think 'wow' when I look in the mirror, and create a really noticeable difference to my lashes.

So I'm relieved to see that after applying a coat of mascara on top of the primer, the results are, thankfully, much more impressive.

While I would normally need a good two or three coats of mascara before really achieving the kind of volume and length that I desire in my lashes, after using the primer, it takes just one thin layer. 

After re-applying the primer on top of my mascara, the same results remain - however after applying an overly-generous second layer of primer, I did notice my mascara started to flake slightly.

Fashion star: Kendall announced her partnership with the beauty brand  in November last year

Luckily it wasn't anything a quick dab of a tissue couldn't clear up, but definitely something to bear in mind if you are eager to keep your look as natural as possible. 

But on the whole, I am impressed with the results. 

My lashes look noticeably longer, thicker and have a really strong black tint to them. So much so that a colleague even commented on them, asking what product I had used to make them look so lengthy. 

Sadly however, they don't have quite the same natural look to them as Kendall's do in the Little Black Primer ad. 

It is hard to tell whether she is wearing the primer by itself or with mascara layered on top but it appears that the seemingly effortless flutter she flaunts at the camera can only be achieved by possessing the same Jenner/Kardashian gene - or a very talented make-up artist.
