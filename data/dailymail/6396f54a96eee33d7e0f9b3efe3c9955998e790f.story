There are fears the number of homes lost in bushfires burning across the Adelaide Hills could top 30 as firefighters battle to contain the blazes before hot weather grips the state again on Wednesday.

A watch and act alert is active for the Sampson Flat bushfire, in the Mount Lofty ranges, which has been burning since Friday, and has claimed almost 13,000 hectares of scrub and farmland.

The fire front is continuing to pose a risk to properties.

An initial tally indicates at least a dozen homes have been lost and South Australia's premier says another 20 are likely to have been lost in the inferno.

'We did fear that a further 20 may have been lost and we'll know by the middle of the day the actual numbers,' Premier Jay Weatherill told Channel 9 on Monday.

'But of course we do know that kennels housing people's pets have been lost and that is obviously a massive tragedy for people.

'Stock losses are likely to be considerable and sadly there will be homes that will have been lost.

'We want to know exactly where they are so that we can communicate with people before they have to go and see that for themselves.'

Widespread road closures remain in place around the Sampson Flat area.

Fire crews are also working to contain the blaze to within its general perimeter ahead of a return of hot weather.

The mercury is forecast to hit 34 degrees Celsius in Adelaide on Monday before surging to 38 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.

'This is by no means over,' Mr Weatherill also told the ABC on Monday.

'We're really racing against time to try to make sure that we get as much of this contained before the hotter weather and the stronger winds are expected later in the week.'

South Australia is enduring the state's worst fire conditions since the Ash Wednesday blaze in 1983, in which 28 people died in SA.  

On Sunday, two elderly people -a man from Kersbrook and a woman from Cudlee Creek - were reported as possibly missing but were later located safe and well after seeking refuge from the fire.

Meanwhile, a man was arrested at Tea Tree Gully on Sunday morning after he repeatedly tried to enter the fire control area.

The 45-year-old, from Fairview Park, was arrested at North East Road and charged with failing to comply with a direction of an officer. He was bailed to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on February 3.

No roads have yet been reopened as police say they will act immediately on advice from Country Fire Service when it is deemed safe to bring in the current traffic cordons and allow access to safer areas.

The state Country Fire Service downgraded its emergency warning to a watch-and-act message on Sunday, but said the blaze continued to burn freely in all directions.

Among the communities still considered at risk were those at One Tree Hill, Humbug Scrub, Mount Crawford, Kersbrook, Birdwood, Gumeracha, Kenton Valley, Cudlee Creek and Inglewood.

The raging fires have significantly affected farms and other private land in the area, causing wide ranging damage to crops and livestock.

The conditions were the worst experienced since the Ash Wednesday fires in the state, which happened in 1983

The chief veterinary Officer at PIRSA, Dr Roger Paskin, is urging residents in the area who have affected livestock should carefully assess those livestock for burns and injuries after the fire front has passed and is safe to do so.

He added that the first action for landowners with injured livestock is to contact their local vet and get them to inspect any livestock that have been injured by fire or smoke.

'Owners are in the first instance responsible for the welfare of livestock and for their treatment and first aid.

'If a veterinarian is not available landowners can contact the Stock Assessment Hotline at PIRSA whose staff can assist with advice on welfare issues and how to treat injured animals', Dr Paskin said.

'In addition to arranging veterinary help, owners should provide surviving livestock with access to good quality clean water, suitable fodder and shade if possible.

'Further, animals recovering from burns should be placed in a separate paddock or yard where they can be easily accessed, inspected regularly and nursed well.'

The Country Fire Service says 22 firefighters have been injured in the blaze, but none seriously, and one fire truck destroyed

With hot and windy conditions easing on Sunday, the CFS will focus on containing the perimeter of the fire and clearing roads to allow people to return to their homes

At one stage on Saturday evening, the smoke on the Adelaide Hills - 26 kilometres east of the city's CBD - was so dense visibility was virtually nil. 

Premier Jay Weatherill offered his support to those affected.

The government is offering emergency relief grants of $700 to people who have been affected by the fire and need short-term assistance. 

'This is obviously enormously distressing to the people concerned,' the premier said.

'We'll make every effort to contact those people.

'We will be reopening areas once it's safe to do so, however there remains serious risks associated with falling trees and falling power lines.' 

The Country Fire Service says 22 firefighters have been injured in the blaze, but none seriously, and one fire truck destroyed. 

On Sunday, more than 400 firefighters, 80 fire trucks and 14 aircraft continued to work on the blaze. 

In Victoria, storms brought a brief respite to firefighters battling blazes across the state, but not before a blaze at Moyston, in the state's west, ­destroyed three homes, killed thousands of animals and burnt 4,700 hectares of land.

Mr Weatherill said it was vital for authorities to contain the fire's active edges in the cooler weather, with another hot day forecast for Wednesday

An emergency warning had been put out for Hastings, Bittern and Crib Point on the Mornington Peninsula, but the CFA said these fires are now under control.  

Bittern evacuee Barbara Tipper said the roads were jammed as residents fled the fire.

'It was getting pretty scary,' she told ABC 24.

'There's lots of smoke and we have no hope if a fire gets in here.' 

About 40 dogs and cats have perished after a bushfire destroyed large parts of a boarding kennel and cattery in the Adelaide foothills.

Fire ripped through the Tea Tree Gully Boarding Kennels and Cattery on Saturday morning, burning down the cattery and a large section of the kennels.

All of the cats and about a third of the dogs at the kennels were killed.

Owner Paul Hicks says he and his wife were unable to take any of the animals with them when the fire forced them to evacuate.

The devastated couple's home was also destroyed in the blaze.

'It's really, really sad at the moment,' Mr Hicks told ABC radio.

'We're trying to come to terms with what's happened with us and think about what we do going forward.

'It's my wife's passion. She loved the animals and she loved the customers.'

In Victoria, Moyston resident Cyd Kelly packed her loved ones - two dogs - into the car and got out of the Victorian town, as a large and uncontrolled bushfire approached.

'If the house goes, it's all just possessions,' she said on Saturday while sitting outside the bushfire relief centre in Ararat.

The dogs - Frank and Ken - sat nearby, with a bucket of water, in Ararat's quiet main street.

About 20 people and their pets had arrived at the relief centre by Saturday afternoon.
