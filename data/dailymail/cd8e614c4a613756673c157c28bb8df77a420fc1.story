Radio 4's Today programme is being investigated over claims it celebrated drug use in a news report about Bob Marley-branded cannabis.

Ofcom will examine whether the BBC 'condoned, encouraged or glamorised' the illegal drug in what reporter Simon Jack jokingly described as a 'puff piece'. 

Jack interviewed Brendan Kennedy, an American investor who has joined forces with the Marley estate to launch the 'world's first global cannabis brand'. 

The 'Marley Natural' strain will initially be sold in American states that have legalised the drug

The five-minute report was filled with reggae music and clips of Marley's children advocating cannabis use.

The 'Marley Natural' strain will initially be sold in American states that have legalised the drug. Marley, who died of cancer in 1981, embraced cannabis as part of his Rastafarianism, and supported its legalisation. 

However, David Raynes, of the National Drugs Prevention Alliance, said the BBC's handing of the topic was irresponsible.

'As a public service broadcaster it has a duty to be fair and balanced,' he said. 

'This is not a straightforward issue and they should have presented both sides of the story. People will be harmed because of the Marley cannabis brand.

'Some young people may be permanently damaged – and some may be encouraged to take the drug because of this irresponsible reporting.' Ofcom received one complaint.
