A Royal Navy submarine commander was sent on a  two-week luxury cruise of the Mediterranean with his wife in order to adjust to life above the waves – even though he is going to a desk job.

Admiralty bosses authorised the cruise as part of an official ‘Surface Ship Familiarisation’ mission for Commander Paul Dunn, 43, who has transferred to a role monitoring merchant ships after spending several years on nuclear submarines.

While aboard Saga’s Quest for Adventure, Commander Dunn toured the ship and spoke with its crew, according to the cruise ship’s captain.

Commander Paul Dunn, who is paid between £70,000 and £78,000 a year, was in charge of a nuclear submarine but recently transferred to a desk job monitoring merchant ships

The cruise – worth about £4,000 for two people – departed from Malta and stopped off in Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, Majorca and Monte Carlo before ending up in Barcelona, Spain.

Designed for holidaymakers over 50, passengers on the cruise enjoyed fine dining, cocktail parties and a host of facilities including a spa while cruising between ports.

Entertainments while the officer and his wife were aboard included a magic show and a ballet performance.

Last night, Shadow Defence Minister Kevan Jones said the move demonstrated contempt for the 5,000  sailors who have been removed from service in the past three years because of defence cuts.

He said: ‘Why are Royal Navy top brass living in luxury when sailors are picking up their P45s in time for Christmas?’

Details of Commander Dunn’s cruise, from October 24 to November 8 this year, emerged after the Ministry of Defence answered a Freedom of Information request, referring to his voyage as a ‘Surface Ship Familiarisation’ mission.

The trip was sanctioned under the Merchant Navy Liaison Voyage Scheme, designed to foster relations between the Navy and commercial vessels. In the past 12 months, 53 Royal Navy and Royal Marines officers have taken advantage of the scheme.

Commander Dunn was the commanding officer of HMS Vigilant, a Vanguard-class submarine that is part of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. He was awarded an OBE in 2009.

The cruise appears to have been authorised between his posting at the Maritime Warfare Centre at HMS Collingwood, in Hampshire, and a new job at the UK Maritime Trade Operations office in Dubai – from where Royal Navy officers monitor the passage of merchant ships through the Arabian Sea to counter the threat posed by pirates.

Although it is also registered by the Merchant Navy, the Quest for Adventure is a tourist ship.

On Friday, the MoD said that Commander Dunn was on duty during the cruise, but last night they said he undertook the voyage during his annual leave.

David Warden-Owen, the captain of the Quest for Adventure, since renamed the Saga Pearl II, said Commander Dunn had worn his Navy uniform on the voyage and had commented on the differences between life beneath and above the waves.

Captain Warden-Owen, 68, said: ‘He commented on how ships and submarines operate at a different medium and height.

‘He talked to the crew and toured the engine room to get a better understanding of the limitations and exposure of a ship. He spent two weeks with us.’

Saga spokesman Paul Green said the company had met the costs of the cruise as part of the deal with the Navy.

‘The Royal Navy officers who travel with us from time to time are shadowing and observing our crews. This is a job of work, so we pay the cost. We paid for Commander Dunn and his wife but we do not pay his wages.’

Commander Dunn is paid between £70,000 and £78,000 a year. The MoD insisted that the trip did not involve additional costs to the taxpayer. The MoD also stressed that he paid for his and his wife’s flights to Malta to meet the ship and their return journeys to UK.

But last night veterans criticised the scheme as a ‘jolly’.

Secretary of the Plymouth branch of the Royal Naval Association, Arthur Gutteridge, said: ‘When I served in the 1960s, we sailed on our own ships. I don’t think there was ever time for those sort of jollies.

‘I would defend senior officers, though. Perhaps they deserve a period of relaxation.’

Last night, a MoD spokeswoman said: ‘The aim of the Merchant Navy Liaison Voyage Scheme is to foster good relations between the Navy and Merchant Navy, providing officers with experience of Merchant Navy operations and encouraging Merchant Navy liaison in Defence matters.’

An earlier version of this article said Commander Dunn’s wife, Kathryn, had gone with him on the trip. In fact the Commander is divorced from Kathryn and he was accompanied by his new wife.
