A boy of 14 has become the youngest person in Britain to be convicted of ‘revenge porn’ after he used Facebook to sell explicit photographs of his ex-girlfriend for £10.

The teenager was able to use the social networking site to arrange to send images privately of the 15-year-old girl to a friend after they had agreed the fee.

A court heard how the boy had 170 images of the victim, which he was preparing to distribute before police raided his home.

The victim had emailed the defendant the intimate photographs of herself during their short relationship.

She told police that after they broke up she saw Facebook messages which revealed the photos of her had been sold.

Police then seized her ex-boyfriend’s laptop, desktop computer and mobile phone.

A second defendant, aged 15 at the time, claimed his friend had accidentally sent him an image of the girl, but he had then asked for more.

He admitted paying £10 for two more explicit photos, which he put in a locked file on his computer.

Last night Facebook declined to comment on this particular case but said alerts about inappropriate material were taken seriously.

A spokesman also stressed that there is no mechanism with which to make purchases on Facebook.

None of those involved in the case can be named for legal reasons.

The teenager, who is now 16, appeared at Plymouth's youth court alongside the second defendant to answer charges. They were both given 12 month referral orders and must pay £100 in costs

Andrea Parsons, prosecuting, told a youth court in Plymouth that the girl did not realise she was doing anything wrong when she agreed to send the pictures to her boyfriend.

She added: ‘When the relationship ended she asked that [he] destroy the photographs. It turned out the photos were then passed on to [the defendant’s friend] for a small sum of money.’

The boy who sent the pictures, now aged 16, was charged with two counts of distributing photographs of a child, as well as one count of possession of 24 images of a child with a view to them being distributed or shown to another.

He was also charged with three counts of making indecent photographs of a child and possession of indecent photographs of children.

The boy who received the pictures, now 17, faced two charges of possessing indecent photos of a child.

Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws.

It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament.

It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. 

Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught.

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages.  

Both defendants were given 12-month referral orders and must pay £100 in costs and a victim surcharge.

Those who post ‘revenge porn’ pictures and videos could face two years in jail under new proposals. The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, currently before Parliament, has an amendment dealing specifically with the practice.

After the case in Plymouth on Friday, an internet safety expert said there needed to be more education for young people to understand that something described as ‘banter’ might actually be a serious crime.

Andy Phippen, professor of social responsibility in IT at Plymouth University, said it was ‘encouraging’ that the case had gone to court because it showed the victim felt she could come forward.

He said: ‘The fact there was money exchanged, the volume of images and that she was an ex-girlfriend indicates some malice in this case. It’s encouraging it has gone to court. In most incidents like this the victim wouldn’t have thought to complain.’

Will Gardner, of the charity Childnet International, said yesterday: ‘It is essential that schools and parents educate young people about the potentially serious consequences of taking and sharing sexual images.

‘Sex education in the digital age needs to teach young people the laws surrounding sex and the internet, and how consent, respect and trust are essential both online and offline. We can all do more to ensure that young people are given the tools and knowledge they need to stay safe online.’

Last month Macclesfield Magistrates’ Court heard that a teenager posted a revenge porn film on Facebook of her best friend having sex.

Danika France filmed Leah Trevena without her consent. When Miss Trevena protested, 18-year-old France promised she would delete the video. But a month later the pair fell out and France posted the 15-second film on her own Facebook page.

Miss Trevena, 19, a college student, reported her to police, saying she felt ‘humiliated and suicidal’.
