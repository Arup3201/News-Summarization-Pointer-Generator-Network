With the transfer window not closing until September 1, there is still plenty of time for some frenzied activity from clubs searching for talent to either strive for silverware or stave away relegation.

And, with the curtain being raised on the Championship season on Saturday, there's an opportunity for Premier League clubs to run the rule over several players that are surely destined for the bigger stage.

Sportsmail takes a look at 10 stars who could soon be playing their trade in the top flight... 

Bakary Sako (Wolves, 26, winger) 

Powerful left winger who has scored scored 21 league goals in two seasons for Wolves since arriving from Saint-Etienne for £4m.

Wing man: Bakary Sako has been a revelation since arriving at Molineux from St Etienne

Will Hughes (Derby, 19, midfielder) 

Hughes only turned 19 in May but has already made 89 first-team appearances for the Rams. Oozes confidence on the ball.

Blond ambition: Derby starlet Will Hughes has already attracted attention from Premier League clubs

Ross McCormack (Leeds, 27, forward) 

Scored 28 goals in the Championship last season and also topped the assists chart, convincing Fulham to fork out £11m - unlikely to move again so soon but will be hoping to win promotion with the Cottagers.

Hot Scot: Ross McCormack was last season's leading Championship scorer  before a  move to Fulham

Mats Moller Daehli (Cardiff, 19, midfielder) 

A rare shining light for Cardiff in a season of debacle after his January arrival from Norwegian side Molde. Full of energy.

Top boyo! Despite being relgated with Cardiff, Mats Moller Daehliproved his worth in the Premier League

Jordan Rhodes (Blackburn, 24, striker) 

Scotland international striker has scored an incredible 89 league goals in the last three seasons. Cost £8m from Huddersfield in 2012.

Prolific: Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes has scored 89 goals in three seasons at Ewood Park

Patrick Roberts (Fulham, 17, forward) 

A star in youth football with England and Fulham, the tricky and diminutive forward looks set to burst on to the scene this season.

Jordan Obita (Reading, 20, winger) 

England Under 21 international showed his versatility by playing much of last season at left back. Looks a Premier League player.

Jack of all trades: Reading's Jordan Orbita looks equally adept playing full-back and as a winger

Joe Gomez (Charlton, 17, defender) 

Charlton are very excited about their latest academy product, with new manager Bob Peeters set to start the season with the England youth at centre back.

Kid and play: Academy graduate Joe Gomez is set to start in the heart of defence for Charlton

Moses Odubajo (Brentford, 21, winger) 

Outstanding for Leyton Orient last season. Scored a screamer in the League One play-off final but moved across London following the defeat.

It's a London thing! Moses Obubajo moved from Leyton Orient to Brentford in the summer

Britt Assombalonga (Nottingham Forest, 21, striker) 

Showed he is capable of any type of finish on the way to a 33-goal tally in all competitions for Peterborough last season, earning him a £5m move to Forest.
