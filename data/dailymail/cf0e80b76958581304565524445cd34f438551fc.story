A new treatment could help millions suffering from rosacea - a skin disorder causing embarrassing facial redness.

The skin gel is the first prescription drug available on the NHS to dramatically cut facial flushing within half an hour.

The effect lasts for up to 12 hours, according to clinical trials.

The active ingredient, brimonidine, restricts excessive blood flow to the upper layers of the skin.

Previous treatments, including laser therapy, oral and topical antibiotics, have had limited success.

Dr Anton Alexandroff, Consultant Dermatologist at University Hospitals Leicester, said: 'Rosacea is often misunderstood and until now we have been extremely limited in the options we can offer people suffering from facial redness.

'Typically the symptoms associated with rosacea get worse if left untreated so it's key that we recognise and treat this condition.'

Many sufferers give up going to the GP as existing treatments tend to deal with inflammation and pus-filled spots rather than the redness, he said.

'It's very embarrassing for patients and there is no current treatment for the redness,' said Dr Alexandroff.

Pop star Ricky Wilson, lead singer with the Kaiser Chiefs and judge on BBC's The Voice, is among an estimated six million Britons suffering from the problem.

The condition is often mistaken for adult acne, but in its severe stages can make the nose appear deformed, red and bulbous.

Around six million Britons suffer from the chronic skin disorder rosacea, with famous sufferers including former U.S. president Bill Clinton and Kaiser Chiefs singer Ricky Wilson, who is a judge on BBC's The Voice.

It causes characteristic facial redness and spots affecting the forehead, cheeks, around the mouth and particularly the nose, which can look red and swollen.

It typically begins after the age of 30, with middle-aged women often affected because of hot flushes during the menopause.

The problem, which may get worse if left untreated, can cause some people to be so embarrassed by their appearance they become social recluses.

Surveys show seven in 10 sufferers feel rosacea has sapped their self-confidence, while two in five have avoided being seen in public and cancelled social plans.

One in three admits to calling in sick at work because of rosacea.

Treatments such as oral and topical antibiotics, as well as laser therapy, have limited success.

London dermatologist David Fenton said the biggest danger was the damage to people's confidence and the danger of 'over-focusing' on their appearance.

He said: 'The emotional and psychological turmoil caused by skin conditions should never be under-estimated.

'When the face is affected, the individual can become very self-conscious and may get it out of perspective.

'Medical advice can prevent patients from aggravating it, by avoiding spicy foods, alcohol and hot rooms.'

Psychotherapy can help sufferers who find it hard to cope with social situations, he added.

Rosacea's exact cause is unknown but 
chronic inflammation is believed to play a critical role in causing 
redness affecting the nose, forehead, cheeks and around the mouth.

It can be aggravated by certain triggers including heat, cold, intense physical exercise, alcohol and caffeine.

Doctors
 advise dietary and lifestyle adjustments like avoiding key triggers 
while some patients benefit from anti-inflammatory antibiotics.

GP Dr Ellie Cannon said: 'Many people underestimate the impact of the flushing and redness associated with rosacea: if it is not appropriately managed it can severely impact a person's life, causing anxiety, embarrassment, low self-esteem and isolation.

'It is often discounted simply as blushing but the sad truth is that people are judged negatively as a result of this very visible condition.'

There have been reports of sufferers committing suicide because of the problems caused by rosacea.

Made by Galderma, a tube of Mirvaso costs the NHS around £34 and lasts two months.

It is a clear gel applied all over the face in pea-sized amounts once every 24 hours.

The anti-redness effect works for up to 12 hours, according to clinical trials involving 553 patients where it was compared with a dummy gel over four weeks.

There was a 'significant difference' within 30 minutes on the first day of use and up to one third of patients responded to the drug.

The most common side effects were redness, itching and a burning sensation of the skin.

Brimodine tartrate, the active substance in Mirvaso, works by causing blood vessels of the skin to narrow, which reduces blood flow to the face thus decreasing the redness.

Dr Alexandroff said the ingredient had been used for some time in eye drops and had a good safety record.

London consultant dermatologist David Fenton said the drug gives an extra option to patients who don't want to embark on drug therapy or even laser treatment.

He said: 'Until now the treatment options have been fairly few and limited. They don't tend to target the redness and flushing which is often the most embarrassing part.

'It is one of those situations where superficially observers think that it is just a cosmetic issue but for the sufferer it can cause huge embarrassment and limit them socially, and cause psychological problems.'
