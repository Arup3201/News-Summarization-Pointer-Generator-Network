The 26-year-old 'mommy blogger' who documented her young son's persistent illnesseswas charged Tuesday with killing him by poisoning him sodium through a feeding tube in his stomach.

Lacey Spears of Scottsville, Kentucky, was indicted on charges of depraved murder and manslaughter in the shocking death of 5-year-old Garnett Spears.

Depraved murder is a count often used in cases that suggest extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, however -- 25 years to life.

Spears pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Tuesday and was being held without bail. A call to her lawyer, David Sachs, was not immediately returned.

At Tuesday's hearing, Spears largely kept her head down as prosecutors laid out their case, reports lohud.com.

And it all boiled down to one unthinkable accusation.

'This mother was intentionally feeding her son salt in toxic levels,' Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd said.

The now childless woman spoke only the words 'Yes, sir' when asked if she was indeed Lacey Spears by New York state Supreme Court Justice Barry Warhit.

After her 
son's death, Spears has fled New York, where the Alabama native lived in
 a 'fellowship community' of back-to-the-land types, for Kentucky.

Her attorney David Sachs denied his client had anything to do with her son's death.

'Lacey is completely devastated by the loss of her son and absolutely denies harming her son in any way,' Sachs told FoxNews.com

Spears,
 who at the time was living in Chestnut Ridge, brought her son to Nyack 
Hospital in Rockland County on January 17, reporting he was having 
seizures.

On
 January 19, with no medical explanation, Garnett-Paul's sodium levels 
rose to an extremely dangerous level. Spears was sharing her son's 
hospital room and prosecutors believe the mother administered sodium 
through the boy's stomach tube.

The
 boy was transferred to the Westchester Medical Center. The Westchester 
district attorney says doctors there suspected Spears was harming her 
son and called New York state children's services, which launched an 
investigation.

Even
 before he tragically passed, hospital officials told police that his 
sodium levels were suspiciously high - which caused the investigation to
 be opened into the Chestnut Ridge mother.

Following this, police sought and obtained a search warrant for her home in mid-January.

Too far: Spears allegedly sickened her son over and over in order to gain attention, but eventually went too far and lost her only child

They took food from her home, her cell phone and computer. They have also questioned Lacey Spears' friends and family and obtained Garnett's past medical records after discovering that he had been hospitalized 23-times during his short life.

As the investigation continued, a neighbor who asked not to be named told USA Today that as Spears' son lay dying she asked her to go to her home and dispose of one of the boy's feeding bags - which allegedly contained a large amount of sodium.

Police have not released why Garnet had a feeding tube - believed to be in his abdomen - but have pointed to his history of illness and repeated hospital visits.

The neighbor who asked not to be named said that they did initially remove the bag - but then phoned the police and turned it over when they heard about the circumstances surrounding the boys death.

Tragic: Garnett died of toxic levels of sodium. Doctors immediately became suspicious of his mother after discovering the extreme salt levels

Those circumstances, it became clear all too late, were nothing new.

The same questionable parenting and suggestions of the child-harming mental illness Munchhausen by proxy surrounded Garnett and his mom starting from just after the boy was born and across the states of Alabama, Florida and New York.

The Florida Department of Children and Families revealed in April that they've had a file on Spears since 2011, when an anonymous call voicing concerns about her parenting was made to their abuse hotline.

And prior to that, in 2009 while the family lived in Alabama, Garnett suffered severe seizures and had to be flown by helicopter to a Decatur hospital and resuscitated.

The Journal News reported in April that the Florida agency is sharing all information they have on the mother with New York authorities.

Munchausen by proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child — to get attention.

'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome.

'But medical child abuse can and does occur.'

Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse.

1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally.'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said. 'A feeding tube is a real red flag.'

2) It is almost physically impossible to ingest or force feed a lethal does of salt. However, introducing it over time through a feeding tube is possible.

3) Feldman points out that those with Munchausen often exhibit pseudologia fantastica — compulsive lying - Spears told lies about her partner and about being a mother

4) Exaggerated stories of their child being ill is another symptom - and in this case Spears obsessively detailed her child's illnesses online

People with the condition also have borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by problems with impulsive and reckless behavior, leading to unstable relationships.
