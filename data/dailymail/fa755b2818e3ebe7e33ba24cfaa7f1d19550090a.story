On the eve of the First World War it was just another ordinary British street - a nondescript cul-de-sac of 60 terrace houses, home to dozens of hard-working blue-collar families.

But by November 1918, some 161 residents of Chapel Street in Altrincham had stepped up to serve their country in the trenches of the Great War. Of those 29 were killed in action while a further 20 would succumb to their injuries on their return.

Such was its sacrifice that King George V called Chapel Street the 'bravest little street in England' for having provided so many volunteers.

Sacrifice: Chapel Street in Altrincham, Cheshire. From this one cul-de-sac 160 volunteered to fight in the trenches during World War One

Chapel Street today: The terraces houses were torn down in 1939 as part of a slum-clearance project, a Blue Plaque on the wall of an Italian restaurant commemorates those who volunteered and those who lost their lives

Today the rows of terraces are gone, torn down in 1939 as part of slum-clearance project, to give way to modern flats.

A blue plaque attached to the side of an Italian restaurant is the only reminder of men who volunteered to do their duty and those who paid the ultimate price.

Many of the men of Chapel Street were Irish immigrants who worked as labourers. The lack of work in the winter months was one reason why so many were quick to volunteer.

They were ideal recruits, fit and strong from doing 
building work, some had experience of fighting in the Boer War, others 
wanted a chance to become a hero and earn respect.

Of the 161 who served, 88 joined up immediately. The youngest was just 16, the oldest 44, meaning  both would have lied about their age to sign up.

They included Hugh Hennerly, who joined Cheshire Regiment and took part in the Battle of Mons in 1914 – during the retreat told to hold the line to the last man.

At the end of the battle out of 1,000 men of the 1st Bn Cheshire Regiment, only 200 were left so had to bring men back from posts in India to replenish the ranks.

And there were the three Wyatt brothers - Frank who joined up in 1914 aged 23, Joseph the eldest who joined up in 1915 aged 25 and the youngest Thomas, who joined up a week later aged 22.

Joseph rose to the rank of Corporal with the Cheshire regiment and lost two fingers on his left hand in 1916 while fighting on the Somme.

Thomas was a driver in the Royal Field Artillery, while Frank's service record has been lost.

All three returned but Thomas died in 1921 aged 27, possibly as a result of being gassed. Frank struggled to find work on his return and died in 1937 aged 47 and was buried in a pauper's grave.

The Wyatt brothers are among those remembered at a special exhibition at the Imperial War Museum in Salford Quays, to mark the centenary of the war.

Of course the loss of so many of its young men took its toll on Chapel Street. Without their breadwinners many of the families fell into poverty.

On April 5, 1919, a memorial was unveiled outside All Saints Church by the Earl of Stamford to commemorate those who served and those who did not return.

Some 70 survivors of the original 161 volunteers marched on 
parade, accompanied by a brass band, those who were unable to walk due 
to their war injuries rode in a specially-provided carriage.

To mark the occasion the King sent a five page telegram 
to acknowledge the men of Chapel St.

In 1960 the Chapel wall on which the Roll of Honour was displayed was also pulled down.

No memorial plaque in the area until Remembrance Day 2001 following a campaign by the Royal British Legion in Altrincham.
