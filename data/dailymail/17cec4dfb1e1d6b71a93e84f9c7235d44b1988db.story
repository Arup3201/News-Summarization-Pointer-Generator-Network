With a hefty £1bn price tag, the BBC’s new hi-tech headquarters certainly haven’t compromised on comfort or style.

But just 18 months after opening, Corporation bosses have now demanded a costly EastEnders-themed makeover of their central London offices because they claim they are ‘not inspiring enough’.

Just weeks after announcing the closure of youth station BBC3, bosses are now spending tens of thousands of pounds re-vamping the sixth and seventh floors of New Broadcasting House with a design based around the popular BBC soap.

Re-vamp: Tens of thousands of pounds will be spent on transforming floors 6 and 7 into EastEnders-themed

The new plans, the brainchild of the BBC’s director of television, Danny Cohen, will include an ‘Albert Square’ hot-desking area, with iron railings around it and a Queen Vic-themed meeting room.

The 6th floor is being given a ‘Welcome to TV’ theme and is believed to be centred on the most famous characters from BBC shows.

Carpets are being torn up while ‘street scape art’ featuring well-known landmarks from the BBC soap is also being installed.

A committee put together by Cohen decided that the new themed areas are essential to giving the offices ‘a unique sense of identity’.

BBC worker Emma Saunders, who works in arts and entertainment, has written to Ariel, the BBC’s in-house magazine, to complain about the huge cost of the makeover.

She wrote: ‘Can I ask why some of the carpets have been replaced in NBH only 18 months after we moved into the new building?

‘I think many of us would rather have a modest pay rise than be dazzled by a new garish carpet as we step out of the lift.’

However, bosses at the BBC defended the 
move, saying the re-vamp was ‘necessary’ after BBC creatives complained 
that the 6th and 7th floors was ‘not inspiring’.

The news comes the same week W1A premiered, a satire parodying the Corporation's bosses as ditsy

Claire Dresser, the chief adviser for BBC Television, replied: ‘Following Television’s move to NBH last year, there was strong feedback from staff that the sixth and seventh floors did not feel like creative spaces and lacked character.

‘In response, Danny Cohen asked for volunteers from Television staff to join a committee to come up with plans - at a reasonable cost - to make the spaces more creative and vibrant.

'The changes you are now seeing with TV branding, images and props are the ideas this volunteer group from all levels of Television have devised and agreed to.

‘Once the work is completed in the next month, the sixth floor will have a ‘Welcome to Television’ theme and the seventh floor will have the feel of an outside street scape.

‘The committee also made the decision to change the flooring to give these areas a unique sense of identity and the previous carpet is being re-used elsewhere in the building.

‘The railings around the hot-desking area on the seventh floor will be part of ‘Albert Square’ with the outside of the meeting room branded as the ‘Queen Vic’.

‘We want to make our space feel inspiring and creative - a home for BBC Television that reflects our ambitions as the very best broadcaster and producer in the world.’

New Broadcasting House was officially opened by the Queen in June last year, four years behind schedule and £55 million over budget.

It was earlier this month that BBC bosses announced it was closing youth channel BBC Three from 2015 in a cost-cutting measure.

They said that more than half of the £50million savings will be ploughed back into enhancing BBC1.
