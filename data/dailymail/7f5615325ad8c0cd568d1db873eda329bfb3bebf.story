The devastated family of MH17 victims Mary and Gerry Menke have described the Victorian couple as polar opposites who were not only loved by each other but loved by everyone who knew them.

Breaking their silence through a statement released by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Menkes' family say 'their loss is felt as extensively as it is deeply'.

'Though Mary and Gerry Menke’s lives may have been tragically cut short in the MH17 disaster, they will be remembered by everyone who knew them for the vivacity and spirit with which they lived,' the Menke family said.

'Mary and Gerry were many things to many people: award winning business owners, adventurous world travellers, and active members of the Mallacoota community.

'They were inseparable partners in everything they did, loyal friends, deeply loving siblings and children, devoted parents to four children and doting grandparents to five grandsons.'

The couple ran a successful wild abalone pearl cultivating business, which was unique in Australia.

The fledgling family business, MAPA Pearls, had recently received a local business award and was going to be the focus of an upcoming episode of ‘Coast’.

After a 'whirlwind romance', the couple were married in Mary's home country of New Zealand and 'rarely spent a day apart'.

Following their wedding, they embarked on adventures all around the world - taking them to the African wilderness, diving with whale sharks off Ningaloo and hiking the jungles of Borneo.

But despite their travels, home was where their heart really lay in Mallacoota in Victoria's west.

Both were united in serving their local community - including sporting clubs, schools and the SES - but in personalities they were polar opposites.

'Mary was a woman as colourful in spirit as she was in appearance,' the Menke family said.

'Her easy smile and laugh were as bright as the shock of blonde curls piled on her head.

'Always the centre of attention and the life of the party, you could hear her coming long before you could see her.

'Her "Ger" on the other hand could often be seen sitting quietly to the side with a contented grin on his face and laughter in his eyes.

'Though he spoke significantly less than his adored wife, everyone would stop what they were doing to listen.'

The couple died when MH17 was shot down on July 17. They leave behind four children and five grandchildren

Other than each other, nothing was more important to the couple than their family.

'Mary and Gerry were central figures in the large and closely-knit extended family,' the Menke family said.

'They were especially loving and involved grandparents, doing activities with their five grandsons on a nearly daily basis.

'In the weeks preceding their tragic accident, Mary and Gerry had been surrounded by friends and a large number of family to celebrate Gerry’s 70th birthday in France.'

Gerry was from the Netherlands, born in Hilversum in 1944, and was one of six siblings who immigrated to Australian in 1953.

The 70-year-old's fascination in the ocean from a young age led to a successful and lifelong career in the abalone industry in which he was a diver for 35 years before focusing his efforts on the pearl business.

Mary came from Bignell in rural Christchurch and was working in an Australian pub when she met Gerry during her working holiday around the country.

The pair were returning to their home in Mallacoota on the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight.

Mary and Gerry are survived by their four children - Sara, Brett, Anna and Paul - along with their extended families.

The Menke family also sent their deepest condolences to those affected by the tragedy.
