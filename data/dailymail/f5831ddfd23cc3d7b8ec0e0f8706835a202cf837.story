It takes hours of practice and years of experience to become a piano virtuoso or a concert violinist.

But a new app that works alongside a small USB device lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer.

Users can move their hands and fingers in mid-air, which the clever little device beneath translates into motion and then a variety of sounds that can be layered up to make tunes.

Hands on: A new app that works alongside a small USB device called the Leap Motion Controller (pictured) lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer

The innovation is described by the app’s creators as ‘a new expressive musical instrument’.

U.S. based computer sensor manufacturer, Leap Motion, has turned its attention to electronic music by enabling its hands-free controller to work alongside the Mac desktop app called Muse.

The app is the result of a collaboration between a musician called BT who composes tunes for films and video games and Dr Richard Boulanger of the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.

People can use the Leap Motion Controller, which costs €89 (£74; $79) to make their own ambient music.

The technology, which is slightly larger than a cigarette lighter, tracks the points of fingers using three infrared LEDs and two image sensors to follow movement around 200 times more precisely than Microsoft’s original Kinect sensor.

Infinite possibilities: The Muse app, which costs $9.99 (£6) enables people to create layers of chords, drums and 'atmospheric sounds' using a strange interface of shapes (pictured) to come up with electronic compositions. It uses the Leap Motion Controller so people can compose by waving their hands in mid air

It can read broad and subtle hand gestures and allows people to control ‘normal’ software using pinch gestures to zoom and swiping motions to navigate websites, for example.

The hardware works alongside a conventional mouse and keyboard, which allows would-be-musicians to interact more normally with the computer programme.

The Muse app, which costs $9.99 (£6) enables people to create layers of chords, drums and ‘atmospheric sounds’ using a strange interface of cubes, The Next Web explained.

By hovering a finger over the cubes they are selected and a simple hand gesture of opening the fingers plays them.

The app’s creators said this gives people an ‘infinite sound palette’ from which to combine sounds.

No more boring instruments: The app is a result of a collaboration between musician BT and Dr Richard Boulanger of the Berklee College of Music to free people from traditional instruments. Here a screen shows a more conventional view for musicians who want to compose tunes using traditional notes

Swiping side to side accesses extra chord sets and drums, while an ‘AutoMuse’ function means people can listen to – or play long with – music being automatically composed by the software.

Echo and reverberation of the sound can be controlled by moving hands in a certain way towards the computer screen, making the virtual instrument much more intuitive to learn than a traditional instrument.

BT and Dr Boulanger came up with the idea for the app after seeing the Leap Motion Controller.

‘The idea was to get people away from their instruments so we made a way for people to interface with tones where you’re unbound from your instruments,’ Dr Boulanger said.

The app is available from Apple’s Airspace store for Mac OS X 10.7 or later versions.
