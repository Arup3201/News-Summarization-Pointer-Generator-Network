Fresh charges: Ghoncheh Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, London, has spent almost five months in jail in Iran but now faces new espionage charges

The British-Iranian woman jailed in Tehran for taking part in a peaceful protest outside a volleyball match is now said to be facing charges of spying that carry a potential six-year sentence.

Ghoncheh Ghavami, from Shepherds Bush, London, has already spent almost five months in jail, but now Revolutionary Guards are reportedly intent on charging her with endangering national security.

There is confusion as to what charges Miss Ghavami faces. Her lawyer said earlier this month she had been sentenced at the start of November to a year in prison for spreading propaganda against the state, but the judiciary on Monday denied any verdict has been reached.

Then on Tuesday a spokesman for the Iran's judiciary told AFP that Miss Ghavami was being held for security reasons and over 'links with foreigners'. 

Claims she now faces charges of endangering national security have been repeated in The Times today, which reports that her case has become a struggle between political factions in Tehran.

Hadi Sadeghi, deputy chief of the judiciary's cultural affairs department, told AFP on Tuesday Miss Ghavami was arrested for having 'acted against the security of the country and for links with foreigners'.

He denied the lawyer's account that Miss Ghavami was detained over her presence near the volleyball stadium in Tehran. To explain the almost five months she has spent in detention, Mr Sadeghi said judges can order a provisional detention order to be extended for additional investigation of charges.

The Times reports that Miss Ghavami's case has become a struggle between Iranian moderates who want to limit the damage from an incident that's caused international outrage and hardliners who want her to be charged with spying.

Miss Ghavami was first arrested on June 20 at Azadi ('Freedom' in Farsi) Stadium where Iran's national volleyball team was to play Italy.

She was part of a brief demonstration which began after female fans and even women journalists were told they would not be allowed to attend the game.

She was released within hours but rearrested days later at a police station she had visited to reclaim items confiscated from her near the stadium.

Her family have called on the British government to intervene, but there is little diplomats can do now Miss Ghavami has apparently become a pawn in an Iranian power struggle.

Her brother Iman, who lives in London, told The Times: 'The Revolutionary Guard never knows how to back down. They were very unhappy when all she got was a year in jail. They're determined to make an example of her.'

Miss Ghavami was initially held in the maximum security wing of Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where she had staged a hunger strike in protest at her treatment.

She has since been moved to an open women's prison in Varamin, south of the capital, last week and abandoned her hunger strike. Relatives said she had lost 19lbs in weight

A spokesman for the Foreign Office told The Times: 'We are concerned that the outcome of Ghoncheh Ghavami's case is still unclear, and by reports she may be facing new charges. We urge the Iranian judiciary to follow due process.'

Iran's volleyball federation has said the sport's governing body FIVB informed has reversed plans for Iran to host the under-19 world championships in 2015.

The FIVB announced Tuesday that it has awarded the tournament instead to Argentina.

The president of Iran's volleyball federation, Mohammad Reza Davarzani, said Ghavami's case was not related to volleyball and 'to make a connection between a non-sporting activity and our sport is unfair'.
