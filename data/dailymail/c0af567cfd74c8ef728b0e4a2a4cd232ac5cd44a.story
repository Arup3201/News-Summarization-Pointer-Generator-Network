Jailed: Lawrence Popp, 58, said he was blind and collected fraudulent disability checks

A man who claimed he was blind in order to fraudulently collect $175,000 in disability checks was caught after he was seen driving a speed boat and a snowmobile - and even drove a car to collect the payments.

Lawrence Popp, 58, from Greendale, Wisconsin, was sentenced to a year in federal prison on Tuesday for collecting the Social Security benefits and lying on his taxes.

The successful businessman claimed in interviews at the disability office that he couldn't work, drive or read without help.

Yet videos recorded by agents working for the Social Security Administration and the IRS show him driving to the office, parking a block away and walking inside, before returning and driving off again.

Other footage reveals him driving a boat while a water skiier follows behind, the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reported.

Popp was declared legally blind in 2004 following an illness, and he started receiving benefits. But alongside the payments, he continued to work at his kitchen equipment business.

Popp fraudulently collected $175,000 in 
disability payment and $115,000 in Medicare benefits between 2004 and 
2009. He also evaded taxes totaling about $178,000, authorities said.

He used the benefits to supplement his lavish lifestyle of trips and expensive jewellery for the then-wife Kimberly, who told authorities he bought her a $25,000 diamond and emerald necklace.

A video from 2008 shows him at a benefits review at a Social Security Administration office in Milwaukee. It shows him repeatedly saying he could not drive or read small text.

'I loved to work,' he said. 'I thought there was 
never anything that would stop me from working. My lifestyle has just changed radically... This [interview] is kind of like reliving it.'

But as he left the office, agents filmed him reading his mobile phone and getting inside his car. He drove to a hardware store before driving home via the freeway.

'The lies are just one after another,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Giampietro said in court. 'This is a cynical abuse of a program truly geared to those who need assistance.'

Popp pleaded guilty to the federal 
charges last March. He wore tinted glasses to his sentencing earlier this week and apologized for the fraud.

His attorney, Raymond Dall'Osto, told the court his client was guilty but added that the money and taxes would be paid back quickly. He had recommended probation, citing his client's health issues. 

When agents raided Popp's house, they seized gold, silver and jewellery, which will cover the roughly $225,000 in restitution, the Journal Sentinel reported.
