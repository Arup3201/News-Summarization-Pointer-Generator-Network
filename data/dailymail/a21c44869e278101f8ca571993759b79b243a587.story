Wayne Rooney was said to be furious at being fined £250,000 and dropped from Manchester United's New Year's Eve match after being 'lethargic' at training.

The 26-year-old striker apparently incurred Sir Alex Ferguson's wrath by going out for a Boxing Day dinner with wife Coleen and then arriving for training looking worse for wear.

He was described as 'bemused and upset' at his treatment by the 70-year-old manager over the past week.

Rooney and Coleen were joined by team-mates Darron Gibson and Jonny Evans and their partners in a celebration of United’s 5-0 win over Wigan on Boxing Day.

The United and England star and Gibson - Evans is missing through injury - were said to have been in a bad state at training the day after.

Ferguson was infuriated at their behaviour, sources said, because he had warned them to rest and 'not be seen out and about'.

Although it was suggested that the players had only been for dinner, insiders said Ferguson would not discipline players just for going out five days before their next game.

It was apparently the unacceptably poor physical condition of the players at training that so angered their manager.

Rooney was said to think he had 
been treated unfairly.

The father-of-one was apparently horrified at Ferguson's 'complete over-reaction.'

Rooney was reportedly summoned to his boss's office for a telling-off, and the players were given one of Ferguson's famous 'hair-dryer' rants after apparently discussing what a good night they had had.

He was forced to watch his team's New Year's Eve humiliation against Blackburn - a 3-2 defeat - from a corporate box at Old Trafford.

The players were initially ordered to do extra training on Wednesday, which had been supposed to be a day off.

Then, on Friday night, Rooney was informed he and Gibson would be dropped for the game against Blackburn Rovers, and that he had been hit with the huge financial penalty.

The confrontation between Sir Alex Ferguson and Wayne Rooney has its roots in an earlier upheaval.

In October 2010, Rooney publicly alleged that Manchester United were not serious about winning trophies and suggested that they did not share his own ambitions.

The striker hinted that he wanted to leave the club, with many believing he was about to be lured by the offer of a bumper contract from big-spending Manchester City.

But Ferguson took to the airwaves to voice his disappointment - not anger - at Rooney's apparent desire to leave.

Speaking to a group of journalists, he affected shock: 'I couldn't understand it at all. He said he was at the biggest club in the world and he wanted to stay for life.'

He added: 'This is a club which bases all its history and its tradition on the loyalty and trust between managers and players and the club. That goes back to the days of Sir Matt. That's what it's founded on.

'He wanted to go. I said to him, "Just remember one thing: respect this club. I don't want any nonsense from you, respect your club".'

The upshot was Rooney stayed - with an improved contract - and Ferguson reserved his ire for agent Paul Stretford, who he blamed for turning Rooney's head. But it seems the rift may not have healed completely.

Yesterday afternoon, Rooney told his 
followers on Twitter: 'My resolution - to start the year as a champion, 
and finish it as a champion...'

Sources
insisted Ferguson's strict punishment of Rooney will not have a 
long-term impact on the working relationship between the manager and a 
player United cannot afford to do without.

Rooney is expected to take his place in the team at Newcastle this Wednesday night.

But the episode is a serious lapse at a time when the striker is needed to lead a team struggling under the weight of injury, illness and poor form.

Rooney and the United manager have been involved in previous major bust-ups.

Now, speculation is growing that the latest row could put the player's future at the club in jeopardy.

Rooney and Ferguson’s relationship looked beyond repair 14 months ago after the Untied star told his boss he no longer wanted to play for United.

Rooney released a statement, saying his decision was based on ambition and it seemed certain he would leave Old Trafford.

But within days, Rooney had made a dramatic U-turn and agreed to a contract extension that tied him to the club until 2015.

The club has not yet responded to questions about this week's argument.
