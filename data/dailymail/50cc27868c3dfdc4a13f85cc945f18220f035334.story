While Manchester United and Arsenal meet at Old Trafford on Monday, the match-winning hero of the 1979 FA Cup final between the clubs will be watching in solitude two thousand miles away in Malta.

Former Gunners striker Alan Sunderland emigrated there 20 years ago after his life in England turned sour but he still follows Arsenal’s fortunes and returns two or three times a year as a guest of the club.

‘When Arsenal play a big game, I have to watch on my own, I’m nervous if I am around fans of the other teams,’ he said. Yet he showed no sign of nerves in 1979 when he slid in to win the Cup for Arsenal.

Sunderland, 61, said: ‘The night before the final, an Arsenal fan at our hotel gave all the players a silver dollar as a lucky token — I’ve still got mine!’

But his luck ran out after he retired through injury at the age of 36 having played for Wolves, Arsenal and Ipswich. He went through a divorce, was given a driving ban that hindered coaching opportunities and drifted from jobs in insurance, pubs and letting.

Then, despite having three children in England, he decided on a radical change.

He had an apartment in Malta as a holiday home and 20 years ago decided to stay. He said: ‘It’s an easy life, the island is small and you’ve got the sea.’

He admits to being a solitary person but he is still recognised by fans after that late winner. ‘People talk about my hair in all the pictures from the final,’ he added. ‘Everyone had perms then but mine was naturally frizzy.

‘It’s getting a bit rough and wiry again as it happens. I must get it cut!’
