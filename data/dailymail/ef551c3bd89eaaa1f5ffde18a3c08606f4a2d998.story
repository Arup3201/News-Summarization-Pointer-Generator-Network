NASCAR champion Tony Stewart has announced he is to miss another race after he struck and killed another driver during a sprint car event in New York last weekend. 

Stewart's announcement that he is pulling out of Sunday's Michigan International Speedway came the same day as hundreds mourners attended Kevin Ward Jr's funeral.

Ward
 was killed on Saturday after he got in to a crash at the Canadaigua 
Motorsports Park on lap 14 of a 25-lap Empire Super Sprint race.

NASCAR champion Tony Stewart has announced he is to miss another race after he struck and killed Kevin Ward r during a sprint car event in New York last weekend

A
 video of the incident apparently shows Stewart's car apparently making 
contact with Ward's car before the younger driver's vehicle spins out 
and comes to a stop near a wall.

Ward
 can then be seen getting out of his crashed car and walking towards 
other cars on the track before pointing a finger, apparently at Stewart.

A car 
swerves to avoid him, but when Stewart's car passes close to Ward, his 
right rear tire apparently hits him, and Ward was pulled beneath the car
 and thrown in the air. He later died.

Stewart has not commented since he made a statement on Sunday.

'There
 aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that 
took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,' Stewart said in the statement.

Ontario
 County sheriff's deputies, who have met twice with the Ward family, are
 still investigating the crash and are looking at another video of the 
incident.

Sheriff Philip Povero has said that his 
initial findings have turned up nothing that would indicate criminal 
intent in the crash - but legal experts agree that does not mean Stewart
 is in the clear.

He
 could be charged with second-degree manslaughter under New York law if 
prosecutors believe he 'recklessly caused the death of another person,' 
with negligent homicide another possibility, criminal law professor 
Corey Rayburn Yung of the Kansas University School of Law told the 
Associated Press

After the investigation is completed, the evidence will be turned over to the district attorney.

Even if he is cleared by prosecutors, though, Stewart could face a civil
 suit.

The three-time NASCAR champion is winless and 21st in the Cup standings this season.

He would have needed a victory in one of the final four races to have a
 chance to become eligible for the Chase for the Sprint Cup 
championship.

His sponsors have stayed with him as the investigation unfolds.

Confrontation: Ward Jr was hit after he was nudged off the course and walked on the track, pointing his finger angrily at Stewart. Stewart's car then fatally hit him when it came around the track  

'The investigation continues, and we are monitoring the situation,' ExxonMobil spokesman Christian Flathman said Thursday.

Yesterday extra chairs had to be placed inside the 700-seater auditorium for his funeral at South
 Lewis Senior High School in Turin, New York - where Ward Jr., 20, graduated just two years ago.

The service came one day after Kevin Ward Jr's family revealed found out that they learned about his death on Facebook.

Kevin Ward 
Sr. said his daughter learned of the heartbreaking news online and broke
 it to him over the phone as they waited for updates in the hospital, Syracuse.com reported.

Mr Ward also expressed his anger at Stewart, saying only he knows the truth of what happened on the track at the Canadaigua Motorsports Park on Saturday night.

'The one person that knows what happened 
that night is possibly facing 10 years in prison. Is he going to say 
what he done?' Mr Ward said.

He said that all the other drivers on the track saw the young man walking - but Stewart still hit him.

'Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,' he said.
