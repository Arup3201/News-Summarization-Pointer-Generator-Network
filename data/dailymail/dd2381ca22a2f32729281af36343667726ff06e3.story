A sheriff from Douglas County, Georgia is vehemently apologetic after two teenagers were left locked up in holding cells without food or water for almost three days because 'police forgot they were there.'

Sheriff Phil Miller said that the teenagers aged 16 and 17 met with a judge on Friday afternoon and were taken to holding cells to await going back to the youth detention center where they were assigned.

Miller said that his deputies didn't notice the teenagers were there so they left for the weekend leaving the teens without food, water, or even toilet paper.

Sheriff Phil Miller says he's embarrassed about his department's failure to properly care for the teenagers left in holding cells without food or water and will do what it takes to make sure it never happens again

The teenagers were left in holding cells with a sink and toilet but they didn't have any food or toilet paper

As a law enforcement agency that taps 
itself as a professional agency, I'm as embarrassed today as I can 
possibly be,' said Sheriff Phil Miller.

 Orlando reports that even though the cells had a sink and a toilet that
 the teens didnâ€™t have access to food, water, or toilet paper for three 
days.

Miller says the fault is that of the department and he is committed to making sure something like this never happens again.

'Nobody that works in security is supposed to leave that building at night without checking the cells, and it's not a hard job to do,' said Miller.

Miller told reporters that there is a policy set in place aimed at preventing these mistakes from happening but that deputies failed to follow guidelines.

Miller says that there is a color-coded system that alerts deputies as to whether or not a cell is locked.

A red light indicates that a cell is locked and that someone is inside.

'We, not following our policy, allowed this to happen and we're wrong,' said Miller.

'We're going to do everything in my power to correct it.'

The sheriff said that the teens were found on Monday morning.

Other than complaining of hunger they appeared to be in good health.

'Thank God nothing more serious than what happened went wrong,' said Miller.

'If I were the parents or the family of these children, I'd be looking at the sheriff to make sure this never happened again, and I'm going to make sure that it doesn't.'

Investigators are questioning deputies and if necessary the responsible parties may be fired.
