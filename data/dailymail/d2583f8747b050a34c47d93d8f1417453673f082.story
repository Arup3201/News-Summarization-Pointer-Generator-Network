We’re pretty sure they aren't essentials in Mary Berry's kitchen, but for those who want to give a gift with a sexy twist this Christmas these Karma Sutra cookie cutters are a tasty idea.

The £17.99 set includes four raunchy positions to recreate in dough, including the naughtily-named ‘Baking From Behind’ and ‘Very Well Risen’ designs.

The Karma Sutra Cookie cutter set contains four shapes, each depicting a couple in a different sexual position

Part of the fun with the cookies is to add your own decoration to animate them

Each cookie cutter depicts two 
gingerbread men/women positioned in a different sex act found in the ancient 
erotic manual the Karma Sutra.

The comical set is described by sellers Firebox as ‘a filthy assortment.'

The instructions read: 'Simply prepare your favourite type of cookie dough, cut out your shapes and then turn your oven into a sordid little dungeon of carnal pleasure.

‘Whilst you furiously beat the dough, squirt the icing and grab yourself a nice big rack to cool your cookies on, you can think up all sorts of hilarious baking double entendres.’ 

In addition to 'Baking From Behind' and 'Very Well Risen' there is also 'Tuffin The Muffin' and 'Over Baking It'

The set of four cutters costs £17.99 from online shop Firebox
