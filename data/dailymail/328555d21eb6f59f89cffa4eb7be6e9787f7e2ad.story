Investigation: West Yorkshire Police confirmed that further inquiries are being made to gain a 'better understanding' of the relationship between officers and Jimmy Savile, pictured

Detectives are looking into claims that on-duty police officers went to weekly 'breakfast clubs' at the penthouse flat of paedophile Jimmy Savile.

West Yorkshire Police are quizzing officers over the so-called 'Friday Morning Club' where Savile served up coffee and cake.

The police force had said in October that it had no information regarding officers visiting Savile's flat in Leeds, West Yorkshire, but added that they were 'free to do what they wished when off-duty'.

But a spokesman has confirmed that further inquiries are being made to gain a 'better understanding' of the relationship between officers and the shamed former DJ.

Police are said to have attended while being encouraged to play a more active role in the community.

But the spokesman said that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by force employees past or present.

He said: 'Local officers working in the community were invited by Savile to his home for a coffee.

'At that time the force was encouraging community officers to interact more with residents in their area. The officers usually visited on a Friday.

'It was usual for other friends of Savile to be present drinking coffee and chatting.

He added: 'If any issues come to light which warrant further scrutiny, we will investigate fully.'

Savile invited guests to his house for coffee and cake on a Friday morning for around two decades.

Serving and retired officers are said to have regularly attended including retired Inspector Mick Starkey and Sergeant Matthew Appleyard, who currently works in neighbourhood policing in Weatherby, North Yorkshire.

Host: Savile, pictured after receiving his knighthood in 1990, hosted the Friday Morning Club for 20 years

In an authorised biography of Savile, his friend Howard Silverman, who was another regular guest, was quoted as saying: 'I can't really reveal what we spoke about at the FMC... but we certainly put the world to rights and had a blooming good laugh.'

There is no suggestion that members of Savile's 'club' knew of the presenter's catalogue of sexual abuse.

Enquiries by West Yorkshire Police are unrelated to the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree investigation into hundreds of allegations made against Savile, said to be one of Britain's most prolific sexual offenders.

The probe is also separate from a investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into allegations that an unnamed police officer acted on behalf of Savile in a 2009 Surrey Police inquiry.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
