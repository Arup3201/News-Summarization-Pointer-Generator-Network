Andrew Fryberg, 15, and Mr Hatch, 14, were the shooter's cousins and Ms Soriano and Ms Chuckulnaskit, also 14, were close friends of the group.

Shaylee's family said in a statement: 'Our hearts are broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter. Shay means everything to us. 

'In Shay’s short life she has been a radiant light bringing us incredible joy and happiness. She has been a loving daughter, a caring sister, a devoted friend and a wonderful part of our community. We can’t imagine life without her.

One of the two remaining survivors - Andrew Fryberg - are still in critical condition being treated for severe head wounds.

The third, Nate Hatch, is recovering but cannot talk and still has a bullet in his chest. 

Last night, Nate gave hope to friends and relatives reeling in shock by posting a Facebook update from his bed at Harborview Medical Center saying: 'Greatful [sic] to be alive'.

He was shot in the jaw by his cousin and best friend, Jaylen.

His grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate had started communicating with his family by writing notes.

Donald Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends.

He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'.

Spoken out: Nate Hatch posted this Facebook message from Harborview Medical Center where he is being treated for a gunshot to the jaw fired  by his cousin Jaylen Fryberg in Friday's school shooting

Improving: Nate has improved from a critical condition to stable, but he still unable to talk

'His eyes could barely open,' Mr Hatch added. 

The other survivor, Andrew Fryberg, is fighting for life at the same hospital as Nate Hatch, Harborview.

It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew.

Ms Galasso was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire.

She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack.

Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead.

In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' 

The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students. 

Lukas Thorington, 14, a freshman at Marysville's other public high school who grew up with Ms Galasso and Ms Chuckulnaksit said they were outgoing, popular kids.

He told the Seattle Times: 'Zoe was very outgoing. She was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.' 

Corey Williams, 37, is friends with Zoe's mother and wanted to help, so he set up a fundraising page to raise money for the Galasso family. Donations have already exceeded $14,000.

Friends: Jaylen was a vibrant member of the friendship group, pictured left with Shaylee and right with Nate

He told the paper: 'I'm pretty surprised. I put $10,000 as the goal as a pie-in-the-sky thing. I'm shocked.'

A picture uploaded to Facebook shows Shaylee posing alongside the Jaylen Fryberg.

The popular schoolboy who was a member of the football and wrestling team shot five people with his father's gun, before turning the gun on himself. 

A friend on Twitter said Jaylen was 'heartbroken' over a girl and didn't know what to do. She added that he 'wasn't a bad kid'. 

He had also written messages on his own Twitter page suggesting he may have been facing some troubles, such as: 'It breaks me... It actually does.'
