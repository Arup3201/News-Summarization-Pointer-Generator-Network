Perhaps Royal Ascot’s fashion police were snoozing on the beat.

Showing her black lace bra in a backless, thigh-skimming dress, Zoe Neilson made it into the exclusive royal enclosure – which is supposed to have the strictest dress requirements of all.

The tattooed 23-year-old dismissed the tough new sartorial regulations as ‘pretentious’ as she evaded the dress code assistants patrolling the turnstiles yesterday.

Dismissive: Zoe Neilson, 23, said the new regulations at Royal Ascot were 'pretentious'

She was in breach of two rules – giving a glimpse of her underwear and wearing a dress not of ‘modest length’, both strictly prohibited in the prestigious enclosure.

But it was the former private schoolgirl’s nose ring and heavily tattooed arm which were more likely to provoke controversy.

Getting away with it: Zoe Neilson showed her black lace bra in a backless, thigh-skimming dress

While not against the regulations, they could cause a stir among the well-heeled guests at the genteel race meet.

And one can only wonder what the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who were in attendance for the second day, made of the less than distinguished attire chosen by some racegoers.

Organisers have introduced a tough new dress code this year after increasing numbers of visitors were accused of falling on the wrong side of propriety.

The revised regulations demand hats in the royal enclosure and fascinators in the grandstand.

Bottom-skimming skirts, strapless tops, halternecks and spaghetti straps are banned.

Fashion officers patrol the gates to hand out free pashminas, ties and fascinators to anyone who breaks the rules – while those who require a hat must pay a £50 cash deposit to encourage them to return it.

Yesterday, arts graduate Miss Neilson, who attended St Mary’s boarding school in Wantage, Oxfordshire, now part of £29,000-a-year Heathfield School in Ascot, said: ‘I knew my dress was too short so I tugged it down just before I went through the gates.

‘I saw the stewards as I went into the enclosure, but I just thought “Whatever, I’m having a good time, you have a good time”.

‘I feel a bit bad about showing my bra at the back – but not really actually because you can’t please everyone.

‘I like that everyone gets dressed up for Ascot but I think it’s a little bit pretentious.

‘Then again, you don’t want everyone running around in here in mini-skirts and crop tops.’

When
 asked about her tattoos, which feature heavily down her left arm and 
include roses, ivy  and a pocket watch, Miss Neilson, of Wandsworth, 
south London, said: ‘I didn’t even think twice about my tattoos. I don’t
 think it’s an issue these days at all and I think they are nice.’

The
 portrait artist shares her passion for inking with fellow racegoer 
Joanna Southgate, 34, who attracted attention at Ascot on Tuesday after 
removing her leather jacket to reveal heavily tattooed arms beneath a 
classy red dress and cherry-shaped headpiece.

Yesterday, the office worker,  of Brixton, south London, insisted her tattoos – which include  two naked ladies and an octopus – were ‘tasteful’.

She said: ‘It is interesting that it has caused a stir. I had a really good day at Ascot and no one made any untoward comments to me about my tattoos. Everyone was really accepting.

‘My tattoos were done by an amazing artist and I think mine are very tasteful, very artistic. They are a work of art.

‘If I had badly done tattoos or offensive tattoos then I would certainly cover them up for the races.’

She described her tattoos as  ‘art nouveau’, saying they included a ‘naked woman lying on her side’ and the top half of a ‘naked Japanese lady’.

Both of the women were, she said, ‘covering up their extremities’.

While
 the body art on show may have raised some eyebrows, plenty of racegoers
 passed the dress code test with flying colours  yesterday – no doubt 
helped by the fact that many appeared to have followed in the 
immaculately shod footsteps of the Duchess of Cambridge.

The
 grandstand was packed with women in knee-length shift dresses, skirt 
suits and nude court shoes that were similar to Kate’s favourite LK 
Bennett Sledge heels.

It
 came days after the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of  Cornwall and 
the Countess of Wessex all wore nude court shoes to the Order of the 
Garter service at Windsor Castle.

Nurse
 Fiona Webb, 29, of Wokingham, Berkshire, wore a pair of nude sling-back
 patent shoes with a blue and orange dress and nude-coloured hat for her
 visit to the races.

She said: ‘This is the first time I have worn nude heels but it went with my dress and there were so many in the shops.

‘I
 didn’t consciously choose them because Kate Middleton wears them but I 
suppose she has had  an influence on women’s fashion. She is certainly 
always very  well dressed.’

And
 as always, the Queen showed racegoers how it should be done, wearing a 
powder pink hat and matching coat and dress to the event yesterday.

Her
 choice was welcomed by radiotherapist Lauren Evans, 23, who remains on 
track to win £25,000 on a £5 bet with Ladbrokes if she guesses the 
colour of the Queen’s hat every day of Ascot. She correctly predicted 
that the Queen would wear blue on Tuesday.

Miss
 Evans, of Kensington, said: ‘I’m in shock to be honest. It’s crazy that
 she’s actually wearing pink. I don’t want to get carried away because 
there’s still three days to go.’
