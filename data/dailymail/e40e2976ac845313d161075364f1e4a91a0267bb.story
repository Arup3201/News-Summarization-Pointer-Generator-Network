Chris Ramsey is now the leading candidate to take the Queens Park Rangers manager's job until the end of the season.

Senior figures within the Rangers dressing room believe the caretaker boss will be handed the role.

The move to install Ramsey is yet to be finalised but the club are moving in that direction.

Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that Ramsey had significant backing from senior QPR players.

Chairman Tony Fernandes is due to jet in to London next week and he will be greeted by glowing references from players, who would now like to see Ramsey - alongside coach Kevin Bond - put in permanent control until at least the end of the season.

Players have been thoroughly impressed by Ramsey's coaching sessions since he assumed control of first team matters last Tuesday.

The quality of his coaching has been compared to that of Steve McClaren - who is widely recognised as one of England's best coaches.

McClaren spent a spell at Loftus Road under Redknapp last season.

Whether a team of Ramsey and Bond - with Les Ferdinand as director of football - is the 'dream' appointment Fernandes alluded to on Twitter remains to be seen.

But Ramsey now looks to have manoeuvred himself into position to become the next QPR manager.
