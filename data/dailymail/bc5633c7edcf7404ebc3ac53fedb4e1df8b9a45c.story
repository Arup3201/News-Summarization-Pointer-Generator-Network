Arsenal record signing Mesut Ozil is clearly relishing his return for the Gunners ahead of Arsene Wenger's side hosting Stoke at the Emirates on Sunday.

The German playmaker, a £42.5million signing from Real Madrid in 2013, picked up an injury against Chelsea in October and returns to the Arsenal squad along with Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Olivier Giroud.

Ozil and the rest of the Arsenal squad appeared in high spirits in training on Saturday but midfielder Santi Cazorla warned his team mates to focus on their own game against a 'dangerous' Stoke side, who beat the Gunners 3-2 at the Britannia Stadium last month.

Cazorla is adamant Arsenal can combat Stoke's direct play by playing to their own strengths, with Wenger's side looking to extend a run of only one defeat in their last 27 Premier League contests at home. 

'They are a very physical team with good players,' Cazorla told Arsenal.com. 'Set-pieces and the second ball will always be dangerous for us. We need to focus on our game.

'[The 3-2 defeat] was strange because we were losing 1-0 in the first 30 seconds and we can't do that. We need to concentrate because they are very dangerous from long balls and [dealing with that is] key for us in this game,' added Cazorla.

'They are trying to play with the ball a little bit more but they are still strongest from long balls and set-pieces. It's very important to get the points at home. When we play at home, we enjoy ourselves and we are stronger.'

In his pre-match press conference Wenger admitted Arsenal have missed Ozil's creative input on the side.

'He is an exceptional football player,' said the Arsenal manager. 'He always gives you continuity in your game. He's a very creative player and ideally you want all your best players available.

'The advantage of these players - for example Giroud, Koscielny, Debuchy, Ozil - at the moment where most of the players in the league have played 26 or 27 games in their legs, they have four or five. If we can get them ready and fresh and competitive, it can give us a new [impetus].'
