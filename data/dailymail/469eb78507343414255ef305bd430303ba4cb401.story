German police have launched an investigation for attempted manslaughter after Galatasaray fans threw firecrackers and smoke bombs onto the pitch and into the Borussia Dortmund spectators during the Turks' 4-1 loss on Tuesday.

Galatasaray is a well supported by Germany's large Turkish community, and according to Ruhr Nachrichten, there were peaceful celebrations in the town centre for most of the evening.

That peace was shattered, though, when the hardcore support started their march towards the stadium, guided by police.

Flares were thrown at police officers and cars during the 60 minute march, with reports suggesting that two police officers were injured.

By the time they reached the stadium at 19.20, there had already been ten arrests. Fans of the Turkish side then set about tearing out seats to throw at other fans, and the unrest continued well into the game.

When Dortmund scored their final goal to secure the 4-1 victory, a flare was even thrown into the Dortmund fan block.

'We saw what happened,' said Dortmund player Sebastian Kehl, 'you just think, what idiots are doing that. Is anyone injured? There could be kids in that block.'

After the match, there were more arrests. Police are now investigating for attempted murder, breaches of the peace, and disregard of the Law on Explosives.

Police also had to deal with Dortmund fans after the game. After the final whistle, a number of Dortmund supporters charged through stewards and security 'in order to attack the Galatasary block', according to police spokesman Oliver Peiler.

This is not the first time fans of the Turkish club have caused problems at a Champions League game. Their away fixture against Arsenal was also halted due to fans throwing flares onto the pitch, and ripping up seats. The club was eventually fined £40,000 by UEFA. This time around, the punishment threatens to be more severe.

Like the game against Arsenal, it was left to Galatasaray's own players to persuade the fans to calm down. At the Emirates, Wesley Sneijder and goalkeeper Fernando Muslera acted as the peacekeepers. In Dortmund, Muslera was once again in the mix, alongside Felipe Melo and Hamit Altintop.

Altintop, who is German by birth, said after the game that 'Individuals need to take responsibility. It doesn't even need saying that fans should express their discontent in a different way. We as a club definitely need to ask questions about this, and strive to present ourselves better.'

Jurgen Klopp described the Galatasaray fans as being 'purely provocative', and regretted that, once again, fan behaviour had distracted from the football.

'Unfortunately, I can't say that this has never happened to us. We've also been responsible for scenes a bit like this in the past. But it has thrown a shadow over a fantastic game for us. It was pure provocation', said the Dortmund coach.
