West Ham Ladies footballer: Katie Sheppard, 20, sent angry text messages ‘shouting’ at her partner

A rising star of women’s football was found hanging days after a row over her girlfriend’s refusal to tell her parents about their relationship, an inquest heard today.

Katie Sheppard, 20, who played for West Ham Ladies, sent angry text messages ‘shouting’ at her partner Nancy Richardson.

The midfielder died earlier this year just hours before she was due to begin pre-season training at the club. Her body was found hanging on July 2 by Nathaniel Hall, her mother’s partner, at her home in of Sidcup, south-east London.

Today an inquest at Croydon Coroner’s Court in south London heard how officers called to her family home were concerned that the couple may have planned a suicide pact.

PC Alex Giacomazzi said he rushed to Miss Richardson’s home after speaking to Miss Sheppard’s brother Christopher, soon after her body was discovered.

He told the inquest: ‘I learned that Katie was openly homosexual and her family and friends had accepted that. 

'I found out she had a girlfriend called Nancy Richardson. I was worried that there may have been some sort of pact and they did it together.’

But when he turned up at Miss Richardson’s home he had to break the news to her in front of her parents. Miss Richardson revealed communication between the two had been difficult in the days before, the inquest heard.

Coroner Dr Adela Williams asked PC Giacomazzi if his investigation had revealed anything of concern before Katie’s death. 

He told the court he had gone through Miss Richardson’s phone and the tone of the messages from Miss Sheppard had changed.

He said: ‘It had suddenly changed very dramatically and Katie started "shouting" over text message, using capitals, because Nancy wasn’t telling her parents about the relationship.’

At 10.29am on the day of her death Miss Sheppard sent a chilling message sent to her girlfriend saying: ‘Don’t look at your phone or you might turn up here and I can’t physically answer.’

A diary found in her bedroom contained a handwritten note with the message: ‘God forgive me, I sacrifice myself to you and to your kingdom.’

Beside the message was a picture of a coffin with the letter ‘K’ on it, the inquest heard.

Doctors records showed Miss Sheppard had been prescribed antidepressants the year before her death, although none were found at her home.

A police investigation and post mortem ruled out foul play and gave the cause of death as asphyxia by hanging.

Recording an open verdict, coroner Dr Adela Williams said: ‘We are left with a situation where there’s really no explanation for why Katie died.

‘We are left with a young girl who had a really major shift in her life, going to university is a major event in a young girl’s life. I don’t think we know if she intended to do it as a call for help.

‘I don’t find the note itself as evidence that she intended to do it, although I appreciate that’s not satisfactory for the family to hear.’

She added: ‘I’m desperately sorry and I would like to give my sincerest condolences to Katie’s family.’

The former Charlton Athletic junior player had recently returned home for the summer from Kent University.

Miss Sheppard, a sports therapy student, had played for West Ham ladies for two years, making four first team appearances in 2012/13. She hoped to go on to play for a U.S. team. 

In a questionnaire on the Charlton Athletic website, she said she aspired to be like footballer Scott Parker, but that her father was her biggest inspiration.

She said of her father: ‘He is the one who takes me to and from games and will always be honest in telling me about how I played and how to progress.’

Miss Sheppard’s family declined to comment as they left today’s hearing.
