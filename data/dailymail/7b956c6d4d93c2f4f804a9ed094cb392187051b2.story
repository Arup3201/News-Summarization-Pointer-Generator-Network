Ohio State University President Gordon Gee announced his retirement and is downplaying the impact that his controversial comments about Roman Catholics at rival school Notre Dame had on his decision.

The 69-year-old Gee cited his age, major upcoming planning changes at the university, his desire not to lose the university provost to another job along with the remarks as he explained why he is leaving.

The comments that likely had a very large impact on his decision to leave were recorded at a meeting last year, where he was heard saying that Notre Dame was never invited to join the Big Ten conference because the university's priests were not good partners, joking that 'those damn Catholics' can't be trusted.

In trouble: Ohio State University president Gordon Gee was heard in a recording joking that the priests at Notre Dame University 'can't be trusted' and that's why they were never accepted into the Big 10 conference

Gee acknowledges he is facing what he calls headwinds.

Gee calls himself a 'quirky' person 
who decided it was best to leave quickly- making his exit next month in 
the middle of summer.

Ohio State trustee chairman Robert 
Schottenstein says Gee's decision is not about a letter trustees sent 
him in March ordering him to watch his public remarks or about any 
dwindling support on the board.

At the fateful conference which was 
held last December, Gee also took shots at schools in the Southeastern 
Conference and the University of Louisville, according to the recording 
of the December meeting of the school's Athletic Council that The 
Associated Press obtained under a public records request.

The university called the statements inappropriate and said Gee is undergoing a 'remediation plan' because of the remarks.

Gee apologized in a statement released to the AP.

'The comments I made were just plain wrong, and in no way do they reflect what the university stands for,' he said.

'They were a poor attempt at humor and entirely inappropriate. There is no excuse for this and I am deeply sorry.'

Gee,
who has taken heat previously for uncouth remarks, told members of the 
council that he negotiated with Notre Dame officials during his first 
term at Ohio State, which began more than two decades ago.

'The
fathers are holy on Sunday, and they're holy hell on the rest of the 
week,' Gee said to laughter at the December 5 meeting attended by 
Athletic Director Gene Smith and several other athletic department 
members, along with professors and students.

'You just can't trust those damn Catholics on a Thursday or a Friday, and so, literally, I can say that,' said Gee, a Mormon.

The
Big Ten had for years courted Notre Dame, but the school resisted as it
sought to retain its independent status in college football. In 
September, the school announced that it would join the Atlantic Coast 
Conference in all sports except football. It also agreed to play five 
football games each year against ACC teams.

In the recording, Gee referred 
specifically to dealing with the Reverend Ned Joyce, Notre Dame's 
longtime executive vice president, who died in 2004.

'Father Joyce was one of those people who ran the university for many, many years,' Gee said.

Gee said the Atlantic Coast Conference added Notre Dame at a time when it was feeling vulnerable.

'Notre Dame wanted to have its cake and eat it, too,' Gee said, according to the recording and a copy of the meeting's minutes.

Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Brown called the remarks regrettable, especially the reference to Joyce, 'who served Notre Dame and collegiate athletics so well and for so long.'

Gee contacted Notre Dame's president, the Reverend John Jenkins, to offer an apology that was accepted, Brown said Thursday in an email.

Ohio State trustees learned of 
'certain offensive statements' by Gee in January, met with the president
at length and created the remediation plan for Gee to 'address his 
behavior,' board president Robert Schottenstein said in a statement.

Comments
by a university leader about 'particular groups, classes of people or 
individuals are wholly unacceptable,' Schottenstein said. 'These 
statements were inappropriate, were not presidential in nature and do 
not comport with the core values of the university.'

Gee
has gotten in trouble before for offhand remarks, most recently during a
memorabilia-for-cash and tattoos scandal that cost football coach Jim 
Tressel his job. Tressel had known about allegations that players were 
trading game paraphernalia for money and tattoos but didn't tell the 
university.

Gee was asked in
March 2011 whether he had considered firing Tressel. He responded: 'No,
are you kidding? Let me just be very clear: I'm just hopeful the coach 
doesn't dismiss me.' Tressel stepped down three months later.

In
November 2010, Gee boasted that Ohio State's football schedule didn't 
include teams on par with the 'Little Sisters of the Poor.' An 
apologetic Gee later sent a personal check to the real Little Sisters of
the Poor in northwest Ohio and followed up with a visit to the nuns 
months later.

Last year, Gee apologized for 
comparing the problem of coordinating the school's many divisions to the
Polish army, an off-the-cuff remark that a Polish-American group called
a 'slanderous' display of bigotry and ignorance.

In 1992, in a moment of frustration 
over higher education funding, Gee told a student newspaper reporter, 
'the governor's a damn dummy.' Then-Gov. George Voinovich laughed it off
and the two became allies in the push for more education dollars.

Gee has one of the highest-profile resumes of any college president in recent history.

He
has held the top job at West Virginia University, the University of 
Colorado, Brown University and Vanderbilt University. He was Ohio State 
president from 1990 to 1997, and returned in 2007. He earns about $1.9 
million annually in base pay, deferred and performance compensation and 
retirement benefits.
