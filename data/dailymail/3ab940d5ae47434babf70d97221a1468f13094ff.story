Two stars of popular new reality series Southern Charm whose pregnancy false alarm became a major story arc really did have a baby.

Thomas Ravenel, 51, and much younger girlfriend Kathryn Dennis, 22, became parents despite an  episode in which Dennis' pregnancy test came back negative that aired on Bravo, TMZ is reporting.

The two reportedly kept their reality TV tryst going after cameras stopped rolling and began shacking up in Palm Beach, Florida.

On March 24, the South Carolina celebutante gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Kensington.

May-December: 50-year-old Ravenel's relationship with the 22-year-old local celebutante immediately raised eyebrows at garden parties across Charleston, South Carolina. Now they'll be raising a child

A recent multi-episode arc of their 
southern-gentry-on-the-rocks docuseries showcased Dennis' pregnancy 
scare, though it remained unclear if it was Ravenel who was the 
potential father or fellow star and self-proclaimed rascally raconteur 
Shep Rose.

Lucky for everyone, except perhaps the show's rabid fans, Dennis did not end up being pregnant.

At least not at the time.

The high-drama duo stole away to Florida, where they continue to live as a couple, where the baby was presumably conceived.

While Ravenel seemed extremely relieved when his gal pal's test came back negative, he told BravoTV's The Dish that he felt the opposite when he met his bouncing baby girl.

'It's really a blessing,' he said. 'It's one of the greatest creations one could ever hope to be apart of!'

In fact, it was the scare itself that showed Ravenel just how much having a baby with Dennis would mean to him.

Happy family: The happy couple say their families are happy with the new addition, despite both being from conservative southern families. Her family, who live in this large but well-worn South Carolina home, were especially happy and visited the baby the day it was born

Rags to riches? The millionaire former politician met Dennis' family, who live two miles out a dirt road, not long after her original pregnancy scare

Faithful: A recent episode of Southern Charm introduced viewers to Dennis's faithful family, including her grandmother (center) and mother and father

Welcome to the family! The grandmother's advice when she learned of Dennis' relationship with a rich older man: Start taking pre-natal vitamins

'I'm getting on in my age and I wanted a child,' he said. 'And after we had wrapped up shooting in Charleston, we had both decided we wanted to have a baby for real. We both love each other and care about each other.'

The new mom is doing well, too, Ravenel said.

'She has tremendous motherly instincts,' he said. 'She's been constantly reading books about babies and doing her homework. She is all over her new responsibilities.

'She has the energy and the mindset to make sure the baby is well taken care of. I've really grown to respect and admire her.'

So will the happy couple be getting married any time soon?

'We've been talking about it,' he said. 'Eventually I'd like to get married. All I can say is stay tuned.'

For now, they're just focused on learning to be parents.

'Kensington is starting to make her needs known—I need ear plugs,' he said. 'But everyone's healthy and happy and we're just blessed.'

It's worth noting that the season finale of Southern Charm is slated to document the Charleston, South Carolina gang's July 4 exploits, which would have been right around the time the new parents would have finally gotten their positive pregnancy results.

It airs April 21 at 10/9c.

Fertile for ground for drama: Dennis and Ravenel have a knack for having fun both separately and together. Here, the recent episode that showed the couple in a doctor's office as they anxiously awaited Dennis' pregnancy test results

Meanwhile,
 and despite not actually being a main cast member, Dennis' presence on 
the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama, 
intrigue and southern seduction.

When the local celebutante, political 
scion and model was hauled into Berkeley County jail for underage 
drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012, authorities snapped the sexy 
mugshot of the century.

For fans wondering how Dennis gets to 
join the soapy series' main cast members in their drunken antics: the 
5-foot-11 redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the 
show's already impossibly high drama.

New parents: Ravenel once served months in prison on felony cocaine charges and recently pleaded guilty to a DUI. Dennis has had some issues with the law, herself. This 2012 mugshot was snapped after she was hauled in for underage alcohol possession and disorderly conduct

Dennis
 may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate 
developer turned felon Ravenel, even with the 30-year age gap.

Like Dennis, Ravenel also has a history of booze-fueled lawbreaking.

He pleaded guilty just last March to driving drunk while summering in East Hampton, New York last July.

The
 former Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign chairman had his license 
suspended for six months and was fined $1,400, according to the Post and
 Courier.

While clearly a lot of fun while apart, Ravenel and Dennis know how to have a good time while together, as well.

Not the father: Another Southern Hospitality cast member, self-proclaimed rascally raconteur Shep Rose was also worried he was the father of Dennis' baby, but she wasn't actually pregnant at the time

Like gentlemen: In an encounter unrelated to the pregnancy, Ravenel invited fellow cast member Whitney Sudler-Smith to 'take it outside,' where he accused the show's resident southern dandy of sleeping with Dennis

Dramatic turn: Dennis and Ravenel's romance has also created a stir outside the various love triangles

Talking trash: The pair drew snickers and sideways glances upon their arrival at a friend's party

THOMAS RAVENEL: THE ONCE AND FUTURE SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICAL POWER PLAYER?

Thomas Ravenel

Ravenel, who's 48 according to his BravoTV bio but 51 if you prefer to believe news outlets such as the Associated Press, was once a major up-and-coming force in Palmetto State politics.

The millionaire former real estate developer held the state-wide elected office of South Carolina Treasurer and had served as chairman for Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign in the state before he was brought down hard in a cocaine scandal.

Ravenel was indicted on federal drug charges in 2007 for buying less than 500 grams of cocaine to share with other people in late 2005.

He was sentenced in 2008 to 10 months after his felony conviction.

And what about now? Besides the Bravo gig, or perhaps because of it, Ravenel is reportedly eying a dive back into politics.

The Republican ex-con told Andy Cohen early this month that he likely intends to run for U.S. Senate.

'And should the current U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham be the nominee, I’m going to throw my hat into the ring as a candidate because I think the voters need the opportunity to have a choice,' he said on Watch What Happens Live.

Kathryn Dennis

KATHRYN CALHOUN DENNIS: POLITICAL SCION, MODEL, CELEBUTANTE, SEDUCTRESS

Kathryn Dennis raised the eyebrows of Charleston, South Carolina's garden-partying elite when she dropped onto the scene as Ravenel's girlfriend, but it's not her first lap around the disgraced politician dating pool.

The 22-year-old was once involved with Thad Viers, a former state representative who resigned his office in disgrace in 2012 after he was arrested for harassing an ex-girlfriend.

Her politico predilections may stem from her background as the daughter of two prominent political families.

Dennis' grandfather was celebrated state politician Rembert C. Dennis and she claims to be a descendant of America's seventh vice president John C. Calhoun (hence the middle name).
