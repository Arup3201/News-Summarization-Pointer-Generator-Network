While Vautour’s 15-length demolition job in the JLT Novices’ Chase was breathtaking, almost as significant was the reaction of trainer Willie Mullins and jockey Ruby Walsh. They clearly feel he is the cream of their crop and are talking 2016 Gold Cup. But he shows so much speed, at this stage I would favour his RSA Chase-winning stablemate Don Poli for that race ahead of him.

Darna gave jockey David Bass a first Festival win in the Brown Advisory and Merriebell Stable Plate and underlined the resurgence of trainer Kim Bailey. It is 20 years since Bailey landed the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup double with Alderbrook and Master Oats.

Martin still on the ball 

A second win at the meeting for trainer David Pipe, courtesy of The Package in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup, had his father and my old boss, Martin, buzzing. ‘It was a certainty,’ he gleefully told me after he won under Irish amateur jockey Jamie Codd. It goes to show that Martin might be retired but his competitive instinct burns as strong as ever.
