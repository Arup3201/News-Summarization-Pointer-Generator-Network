‘Fred is coming off for Jo.’ It sounds more like two characters from Last of the Summer Wine than a Brazilian substitution in a heated World Cup quarter-final against Chile, when their future in the tournament is at stake.

But the swap has been a move Luis Felipe Scolari has played twice. In the 68th minute against Mexico, Jo came on for Fred. In the 64th minute against Chile, Jo came on for Fred.

They are hardly the most inspiring strikers to pull on the yellow shirt of Brazil, after decades – a century, even – of producing supernatural, superhuman, superstar goal-scorers.

Misfiring: Fred (left) has recorded a shot on target every 78 minutes despite starting all of Brazil's games

Down and out? Jo is goalless at the World Cup so far and has only completed eight out of 20 passes

What do you get from Fred? Well, one goal at this World Cup. Which was offside, and a header from two yards out. Also a shot on target every 78 minutes.

That happens to be the total minutes Jo has played in the tournament in his two substitute appearances. He still hasn’t had a shot on target yet. Of his 20 passes – yes, a whole 20 – only eight have found their target.

Neither play in Europe, Fred has had nine serious injuries since 2009 and Jo managed just six league goals in two years in English football at Manchester City and Everton.

One-man team? Neymar has been the World Cup hosts' talisman having scored four goals in four games

They will surely go down as two of the poorest Brazilian strikers to have played for the country.This tournament, Neymar has been taking the brunt; not only has he had to carry the hopes of a nation on those slight shoulders, but that pair have been hitching a ride too.

In total 27 forwards have been tried and tested by Dunga, Mano Menezes and Scolari since 2006 when a replacement for Ronaldo was required.

Before then, there was a stream of great strikers.

Ronaldo won two World Cups, in 2002 and 2006, and became the all-time World Cup tournament top scorer with 15 goals.

Romario, who scored more than 1,000 goals in his career and 55 in 70 for Brazil, and Bebeto, 39 in 75 caps, won the 1994 USA World Cup together.

Careca amassed 30 goals in 64 caps, winning the silver boot award at the 1986 Mexico tournament.And, of course, Pele, with his three World Cup wins, 77 goals in 92 internationals and 1281 goals in 1363 career appearances.

Predator: Romario (left) scored 55 goals in 70 appearances for Brazil and was a 1994 World Cup winner

The King: Pele (centre) won three World Cups with Brazil, scoring 77 goals in 92 international appearances

The names go on: Leonidas da Silva was top-scorer of the 1938 World Cup with seven goals.

Ademir was top scorer in 1950 with seven – four in one game. Vava was top scorer in 1962, even though he was more of a target man, like Fred, alongside Pele who was playing in the role that Neymar has adopted now.

It seems unlikely that Fred and Jo will ever be added to that Brazilian pantheon.
