A former army recruitment officer says her life has been ruined because she was left 'partially blinded' by medication which was meant to cure her acne.

Rachel Yeo, 26, says she experienced shattering migraines when antibiotics prescribed by her doctor caused fluid to build up around her brain.

The mother-of-one has been left with blurred peripheral vision, which prevents her from driving, and requires regular lumbar punctures to ease the increased pressure inside her skull caused by the rare reaction to the routinely-prescribed drug.

Rachel Yeo, 26, developed migraines and vision problems after taking Minocycline tablets to treat her acne

She said: ‘I'm waiting for a scan to determine whether my sight problems can be fixed, but the consultants are not optimistic. I'm absolutely gutted.’

Ms Yeo, of Penarth, in Wales, asked her GP for advice in December 2011 after suffering for several years with acne caused by polycystic ovary syndrome.

She said: ‘Having spots affected my confidence massively. People looked at me as though I was a teenager.

‘I was always asked to prove my age when I bought alcohol and I felt extremely self-conscious when I attended job interviews.

‘I tried over-the-counter creams but nothing ever worked.’

Her doctor prescribed a three-month course of Minocycline tablets, a form of tetracycline antibiotic.

Ms Yeo said: 'Having spots affected my confidence massively. People looked at me as though I was a teenager'

After a month of trying the tablets Ms Yeo's acne remained unchanged and she began experiencing a range of troubling symptoms, including severe migraines and flashing and spotted vision.

The symptoms became so distracting that Ms Yeo was often forced to ask her mother, Lynette, to babysit her daughter Isabelle, now three, while she recovered.

She said: ‘At first, I put the symptoms down to stress. It was frightening. I'd never suffered with anything like it before.

‘The only place I could be comfortable was a dark room. Thank goodness mum was there to help.

‘When my vision became very blurry in October I decided it was time to see an optician. As soon as it affected my normal day-to-day life, I took action.

‘The optician checked me and said there was bleeding in the back of my eyes caused by pressure on my brain.’

Ms Yeo, a former British Army and TA recruitment officer, was rushed to University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, where baffled doctors ordered a lumbar puncture to drain fluid from the base of her spine.

She said: ‘Doctors were practically queuing up to have a look at the effect of the pressure on the backs of my eyes. They'd never seen anything like it before - that's how rare it was.’

In a discharge summary for the case, drawn up in April 2013, Specialist Registrar in Neurology Dr Joe Anderson diagnosed that Ms Yeo had idiopathic intracranial hypertension precipitated by use of Minocycline. 

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is high pressure inside the skull which can happen suddenly or build up over time.

It can be caused by many things including a brain tumour, an infection and a blood clot.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is that which occurs without an obvious cause.

It is most common in overweight women in their 20s and it causes severe headaches and changes in vision.

Ms Yeo said: ‘I was immensely stressed. I wondered whether I was somehow to blame, whether I hadn't led a healthy enough lifestyle. All I could think about was my daughter - what if I had to stay in hospital? Who would look after her?

‘I hadn't thought for one moment that the problems were caused by the acne medication. I had no idea that antibiotics would have such drastic effects. When the doctor told me, I was utterly shocked. He said it wasn't unknown to happen.’

Ms Yeo (pictured with a migraine) is no longer able to drive and says she struggles to watch TV because of her sight problems. She says she feels lucky that she is still able to care for her daughter

The NHS Choices website lists intracranial hypertension as a rare side-effect of Minocycline use.

It advises patients to seek medical advice if they develop blurred or double vision.

Dr Channarayapatna Krishna, a clinical pharmacologist and clinical toxicologist at the University of Wales Hospital, said there were currently no plans to review the use of Minocycline.

Intracranial hypertension is high pressure inside the skull.

It can occur as a result of a head injury, a stroke, a brain tumour or a brain infection among other things.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is that which occurs for no obvious reason.

It is most common in overweight women in their 20s and is linked to hormone problems, certain medications and anaemia.

The most common symptoms are severe headaches and changes in vision.

The condition can also cause drowsiness, confusion, nausea and vomiting.

Treatment options include weight loss, medications, lumbar punctures and surgery.

Lumbar punctures remove excess fluid to reduce intracranial pressure.

Surgery can be used to insert a shunt which diverts excess fluid to another part of the body.

Many patients find their symptoms improve with treatment but they will require monitoring for the rest of their lives.

He said: ‘Minocycline is an antibiotic which is used to treat acne. When categorising reactions to medication, we group them into “common”, “uncommon”, “rare” and “very rare”.

‘A reaction to Minocycline causing intracranial hypertension is considered to be rare. This reaction is reported in one in 1,000 to 10,000 patients.

‘All drugs have side effects and, in this, there are inherent risks. When prescribing drugs, the risks are explained.

‘Usually patients are given a patient information leaflet which comes with the medication itself. The leaflet lists a full range of possible reactions, including those which are unproved but suspected.

‘The healthcare professional, with the consent of the patient, will consider the risks and benefits when prescribing medication.

‘If a medication is thought to have a “rare” or “very rare” side effect, we keep an eye out for those side effects, but the risk is not considered great enough to prevent use.

‘As soon as such a reaction is suspected in a patient, I would advise the patient to stop using the medication immediately.

‘Intracranial hypertension means there is extra fluid or pressure in the brain. The brain is constrained within the “box” of the skull, so it can't expand very easily to accommodate this extra fluid or pressure.

‘Depending on how severe the reaction is, sometimes treatment is needed to bring the pressure or swelling down.

‘The treatment needs to be followed up once the medication is stopped to make sure that it is the drug causing the swelling, not anything else.’

Ms Yeo, who is not pursuing any claims 
for compensation, has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her 
life may never be the same again in the wake of the devastating 
reaction. 

She said: ‘I'm with it for life. There is no cure, but the pressure on the brain can be regulated with lumbar punctures.

Ms Yeo (pictured with a letter from her doctor) says she now hopes her symptoms will improve over time

‘While I wait between procedures, I just have to suffer. With every lumbar puncture, there's a risk I'll lose some feeling in my legs, but it's a risk I have to take.

‘I'm on all sorts of different tablets to reduce the cerebral fluids but the sight loss might be irreversible. I can't drive and watching television is a struggle. I can't get glasses because my prescription could change from week to week.

‘Even though I've lost a lot, I could have lost so much more. I could have been completely blinded or I could have had a stroke or fallen into a coma.

‘At least I can still be a mum for Isabelle. Even though it's a struggle sometimes, I'm lucky that the reaction wasn't even more serious.’
