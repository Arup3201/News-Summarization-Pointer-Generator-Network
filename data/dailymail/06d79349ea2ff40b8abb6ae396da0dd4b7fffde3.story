Parents are furious after seven girls were sent home from their secondary school in disgrace - due to their knee-length skirts being worn 'too short'.

The youngsters were confronted by teachers who claimed the skirts would 'ride up' while they were walking, sitting or climbing stairs.

One girl said a staff member asked to check the waistband on her skirt to see if it was rolled up.

Two others went back to the 1,424 pupil Waterhead Academy in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with what they believed was the correct length of skirt - but were sent home again because it was deemed to be the 'wrong' material. The pair missed up to three days of lessons due to the row.

Today the mothers of Mia Bentley and Olivia Johnson, both 12, voiced their disgust at the school.

Pub landlady Alyson Bentley, 40, said: 'I'm absolutely disgusted that Mia has had to be off school for three days over this. It's just so petty and a   really bad way of dealing with the issue.

'As far as I'm concerned the skirt is the required length but they say it rides up when she was walks or goes up the stairs - but all clothes can do   that in those circumstances.

'Whatever you're wearing your trousers or jeans or skirts will ride up when you sit down or move - you can't help that. That's no reason to make a girl   miss three days of school.

'Mia has tried other skirts but they are too long and too big. Sending them home is not right. Surely a detention or a warning would be more appropriate.'

The row erupted earlier this month after the girls arrived at school for Monday classes. Teachers believed their knee length skirts were too high and   did not conform to its rules of 'a smart, distinctive and mature appearance'.

Olivia and Mia went back the next day but were sent home again after staff questioned the skirt's material.

By Wednesday their parents went to the   school themselves to resolve the row.  Olivia was allowed back to class after she promised to keep pulling her skirt down to the right length, but Mrs Bentley failed to reach an agreement on   Mia's uniform and the youngster missed another day of school.

When she was finally allowed to return after missing three days on Thursday June 12 she was put on school report - meaning teachers had to record a   comment on her skirt every lesson.

The year 8 pupils, both of Oldham, are now so upset over the affair that their parents are considering transferring them to different schools.

Olivia's mother Deborah Jobson, 41, a bookkeeper, said: 'It's ludicrous. The girls have basically been sent home for simply following the rules. The   skirts are quite clearly knee-length - I don't know who says which part of the knee it has to be.

Waterhead Academy in Oldham, Greater Manchester, has defended its uniform policy

'The school policy states knee-length black skirt and that's what this is. The policy has always been there and there's never been a problem until now.

'The punishment doesn't fit the crime. It's not proportionate. The girls have missed out on vital learning.

'People are saying we should follow the rules for our daughters but we are... It's atrocious the school will go to such lengths over a skirt not to   mention the time it took me to actually speak to someone about it.

'Mia and Olivia are both good kids. Olivia had an outstanding school report yet the staff seem happy to put them through all this and allow them to   miss days.

'There's also no consistency either as Olivia said some of the teachers told her, her skirt was fine and there are other kids with skirts even   shorter.'

'If they're going to be pedantic, they need clear and concise rules on uniform. Saying its the wrong material makes them look undignified.'

Mia said: 'I haven't done anything wrong. The staircases are open so teachers are saying people can look up your skirts.But I didn't do any of this on   purpose.'

According to the school's website girls must wear a white blouse, black trousers or knee-length skirt, 'sturdy' black school shoes, tights and black or   grey socks.

It adds: 'Our uniform tries to combine a smart, distinctive and mature appearance with value for money. It is important to us that our students have a   reputation for looking good and behaving well, both on and off our premises and we believe that our uniform helps us in that aim.'

Findings from the school's most recent OFSTED inspection in March last year ruled that Waterhead Academy still required improvement after an inspection   in January which found GCSE scores were 'generally below average'.

It has academy status.  Parents have taken to social media to criticise the school's decision on their skirt-length policy.

One said: 'It's a shame the schools don't pay the   same attention and passion to bullying and truancy, etc instead of focusing and punishing silly little things like this, sort out the big issues.'

Leigh Sharples added: 'They did exactly the same with our daughter. I went into school and they had me waiting two and half hrs before anybody would   see me.

'I'm appalled at what they are doing they need to deal with the issues that are serious in that school not the petty skirt situation. They have more   important things to sort out.'

Waterhead Academy's community director Alison Taylor said school policy was for either parents to bring alternative uniform into school or pupils would   be sent home.

She added: 'All parents and students are aware of the Academy's uniform policy.

'It is the responsibility of parents to send their children to school appropriately dressed. Students and parents are given an opportunity to resolve   issues with uniform should they arise.'

Last week the headteacher of a secondary school where more than 250 girls were taken out of lessons because their skirts were too short defended the ‘uniform crackdown’.

Dr Rory Fox, headteacher at Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight, said the school’s uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness in a letter sent to parents.

He said: ‘We are preparing students for the world of work so it is important that we teach students about the importance of managing their appearance and working to a dress code.

'We have a number of female students who have recently said that they are coming under peer pressure to wear their skirts shorter than they feel comfortable.

‘It is not fair that girls should be made to feel uncomfortable when they are just following the uniform policy.'

Many parents, however, were angry about the clampdown.

Helen Smith, from Ryde, Isle of Wight, said her 14-year-old daughter Jade had been sent home twice on the same day, for having a skirt that was too short and then trousers that were too tight.

The 39-year-old mother-of-two said: ‘It was an absolute joke. It has been a nightmare.

‘I just can’t understand why the school have decided to do it five weeks before the end of the year.'
