Admitted child porn: Christopher Exley is a serving police officer who works for the Met's Special Operations, which protects the Royal Family

A serving policeman who works in the Met’s Special Operations division, which protects the Royal Family, has admitted downloading child porn.

Christopher Exley, 33, faces jail after an illegal stash of pictures was found on his computer when his home in Clapton, east London was raided in February this year.

Exley admitted having 53 indecent images, including 11 at level four which involves penetrative sexual activity containing a child or children, or both children and adults, after looking at websites at Southwark Crown Court.

He denied arranging or facilitating a meeting to engage in sexual activity with a child, and this allegation was dropped by the prosecution. 

Exley has been suspended from his duties since his arrest and now faces the sack after his guilty pleas. 

He was due to stand trial today but the prosecution accepted his guilty pleas to four charges of making indecent images of children.

No evidence was offered against him in respect of a charge of arranging sex with a boy, which he denied.

He was freed on bail on the condition he stays away from children until a sentencing hearing at the same court on January 14. 

The Special Operations Division, in which Exley served, is an elite section of the Metropolitan Police service, which includes the Royal Protection squad and counter terrorism units.

The case comes as the former business partner of Louise Mensch has been arrested on suspicion of viewing or possessing indecent images of children.

Luke Bozier, Labour's former e-campaigns manager, was questioned by police last Friday. 

It follows allegations made online last week that he posted explicit photographs on Craigslist under a pseudonym.

New sentencing rules for courts that mean paedophiles who trade in child pornography will be spared jail were revealed last week.

The Sentencing Council suggested community punishments for those convicted of trading or possessing child pornography in its guidelines on dealing with all types of sex crimes.

People caught selling or distributing internet child pornography may receive ‘high level community orders’, and the council also proposed community orders for people possessing images of non-penetrative sex between adults and children. 

The current benchmark jail sentence for those with a small number of images is three months. Only those with pictures of children posing alone or small quantities of images of children engaged in sex acts, but not with adults, are not jailed.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
