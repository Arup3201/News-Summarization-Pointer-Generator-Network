It's an opportunity for word buffs and maths whizzes to show the world their unrivaled skills. 

But when Hairy Biker Dave Myers was invited to join the Countdown team, the TV personality left the panel of experts lost for words, after submitting a rather rude one from the dictionary corner. 

When presented with a collection of vowels and consonants, the chef suggested 'todgers' to the amusement of hosts Nick Hewer and Rachel Riley.

Host Rachel Riley was left giggling when the word was suggested on the Channel 4 afternoon programme 

Left to dictionary expert Susie Dent to explain, the colloquial word is often used as slang for penis. 

As it is listed in the Oxford Dictionary, it would have counted had it been presented by a competitor and won seven points. 

It is not the first time rude words have been suggested in the Channel 4 afternoon programme which began in 1982. 

In February an English teacher shocked viewers when submitting the word 'm*nges', an expletive sometimes used to describe female genitalia. 

In 1991, two contestants offered 'w***ers', and in 2010 another suggested 's**tface'. 

On another occasion contestants resisted the temptation to spell out swear words when presented with the letters U,D,F,C,K and E. 

TV chef Dave Myers offered the word up for seven points from his chair in the dictionary corner with expert Susie Dent 

Not the first word to have left Rachel Riley blushing, the former Strictly Come Dancing star found herself stifling laughter after drawing the words 'p*ss' and 'a*se' shortly after replacing Carol Vorderman in 2009. 

During her 26-year stint, Ms Vorderman was left red-faced more than a few times. 

Words such as fart, porn and poo are among the collection of letters which had the Loose Women star and her co-hosts falling about laughing. 

Among the crude words which presented themselves during Carol Vorderman's 26-year- stint is 'poo' 

Another cringe-worthy moment as Carol Vorderman withdraws an unfortunate sequence of letters on the show
