An eight-year-old girl suffered horrific injuries after being mauled by dogs while playing in her own back yard.

Rescuers alerted by her screams had to pull terrified Broagan McCuaig from the powerful jaws of two American bulldogs.

The girl’s parents then endured an agonising wait in hospital as she underwent a seven-hour operation for  ‘serious’ injuries.

Witnesses said the dogs grabbed Broagan and shook her like a rag doll as she screamed in pain

Following the incident in Garthamlock, Glasgow, on  Friday afternoon, police seized two American bulldogs and two people were charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Last night, Broagan’s parents Tracy Cox and Neil McCuaigh said doctors at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, could not say if she would walk again.

Mr McCuaigh said: One of the dogs snapped her ankle. She has had several metal pins inserted to hold the bone straight and a brace to keep her leg straight.

‘She will need to go into theatre several more times this week to keep an eye on it.

‘They don’t know whether she will be able to walk. It’ll be around Christmas time before they can tell us.’

It took two passers-by to rescue her, with one man kicking one dog until it released her, while another carried her inside

Miss Cox said: ‘She’s in intensive 
care but she’s stable. She just keeps asking if the dogs have been taken
away. She hasn’t seen herself.

'She asked tonight about her face – she 
thinks she looks stupid now but it’s because it’s swollen on the left 
side and she can’t open her eye.’

It is understood the incident happened in a gated patio area behind the girl’s flat as she played a game of ‘tig’ with friends.

Witnesses said the dogs, which are not an outlawed breed, grabbed Broagan and shook her like a rag doll as she screamed ‘Help me, help me, please can you help me?’.

It took two passers-by to rescue her, with one man kicking one dog until it released her, while another carried her inside.

Neighbour and family friend James Moffat, 44, said his wife Linda, who carried Broagan, covered in blood, upstairs to the girl’s flat on the second floor, was distraught.

He said his wife was struggling to sleep and would not be able to forget the scene.

Mr Moffat, who is known to Broagan as Uncle James, said: ‘She’s a wee skinny girl, there’s nothing to her, it’s remarkable she’s making a recovery. She’s full of beans, a lively girl.

‘She’s got the will in her, she will fight back. We’re a close-knit community and we’re all behind each other.’

Broagan’s 17-year-brother Kiefer witnessed the attack. She also has a sister, Denise McIllhatton, 20, who was on holiday in Amsterdam at the time, and a brother, Niall, two.

The Scottish Government introduced legislation allowing control orders to be applied to any dog in February 2011.

Under the Dangerous Dogs Act, specific breeds are outlawed but it is often difficult to establish whether or not a dog is on the list.

Last Monday, the 34-year-old owner of a Staffordshire bull terrier was left in a serious but stable condition after being savaged by the dog in Larkhall, Lanarkshire.

Earlier this year, 14-year-old Jade Anderson was mauled to death by four dogs in Wigan, Lancashire. Her family said they were ‘disgusted’ when the dog owner walked free from court with a suspended sentence last Friday.

Glasgow Provan Labour MSP Paul Martin called for a more ‘robust regime’ to deal with owners who used dogs to ‘put themselves in charge of the local community’.

He said: ‘Kids should be able to live in their local community without fear.

Pledging to raise the issue at Holyrood, he added: ‘We have to decide if these types of dogs should exist. Questions must be asked about their nature and tendency to attack.’

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘An eight-year-old girl suffered serious facial injuries after being bitten by two dogs believed to be American bulldog types in Garthamlock, Glasgow, at 5pm on Friday.

‘The girl was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children where she is being treated for her injuries. Both dogs involved have been seized. A male aged 34 and a female aged 33 have been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act.’
