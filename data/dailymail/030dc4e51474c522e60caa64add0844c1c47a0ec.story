Good's statement, which said those people re-posting the images should be 'ashamed' of themselves, received more than 20,000 likes.

Meagan Good confirmed the leaked photos purporting to be of her were real, adding she was in 'shock'

The actress is just one of a number of celebrities to have photos of them posted online in a new wave of leaks

The latest leak comes just weeks after naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Aubrey Plaza, were published online.

Good, 33, wrote: 'I'm definitely in shock. Saddened for everyone who is experiencing this. But I "choose" not to give the persons responsible my power.'

She added: 'At the end of the day - we all know these pictures were for my husband. And at the end of the day evidently we all know how I feel about my t*****s.

'That's all I've got folks. Oh yeah, and for everyone who's re-posting the leaked nudes? You should be ashamed of yourself. You have a blessed day now.'

The new, previously unpublished, images are alleged to feature reality TV star Kim Kardashian, American goalkeeper Hope Solo and actresses Kaley Cuoco and Vanessa Hudgens.

They also reportedly include Nashville star Hayden Panettiere, singer Avril Lavigne and actress-turned-fashion designer Mary-Kate Olson.

The nude photos have emerged online after a hacker reportedly gained access to the celebrities' iCloud accounts and stole their pictures.

Apple believes the hacks are the result of 'targeted attacks' on celebrities' user names, passwords and security questions', rather than a widescale breach of their security systems. 

The FBI is investigating the hacks, although they are yet to make any arrests.

Actress Gabrielle Union - another victim of the latest leaks - said she will be contacting the FBI after she confirmed images of her online were genuine.

Union said in a statement to TMZ alongside her husband Dwyane Wade: 'It has come to our attention it has come to our attention that our private moments, that were shared and deleted solely between my husband and myself, have been leaked by some vultures.

'I can’t help but to be reminded that since the dawn of time women and children, specifically women of color, have been victimized, and the power over their own bodies taken from them,' the statement also said. 'These atrocities against women and children continue worldwide.'
