Hatton is a former WBA, IBF, IBO and The Ring Light Welterweight Champion, and WBA Welterweight Champion.

After losing his last fight to Manny Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on a long hiatus, with rumours of a comeback circulating the media since.

But two years ago, on July 7, 2011, Hatton announced his retirement from boxing.

He made a brief comeback but lost his first match in more than three years on November 24, 2012, and announced his final retirement from the sport.
