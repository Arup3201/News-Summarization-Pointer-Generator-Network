Cara Delevingne might be racking up the showbusiness column inches but in the fashion industry there's only one contender for the title of the world's top model and her name is Joan Smalls.

The Puerto Rican is ranked number one in the models.com industry hot list of best models thanks to the constant demand for her from leading photographers and fashion editors, global brands, magazines and fashion show producers.

And her latest job, which sees her smouldering in a shoot for this week's edition of net-a-porter's digital magazine, The Edit, proves why she still holds the prestigious top spot.

Smouldering: Joan Smalls, who is ranked number one on models.com's hot list, poses for net-a-porter this week

Under the creative direction of Editor-in-Chief Lucy Yeomans and shot by industry heavyweight Mario Testino, Joan models the famed photographer's exclusive MATE clothing and accessories collection.

Speaking about working with friend and fellow Latin American, Mario Testino, Joan said: 'It is always such an honor to work with Mario, so I love that he mentioned me in connection to this collection.

'He always creates such a beautiful story that embraces you and takes you on a ride.

'He loves what he does so much. Whenever we shoot with him, we have to travel the day before just to do fittings.

'Mario will sit down with the stylist and he will go through every single look. He has an opinion and feels very strongly about what he shoots, and he says the fitting is the best part of the process.

'He is as much a stylist as a photographer, and is involved in every stage,' she said.

But Joan doesn't just show her strength in editorial shoots.

The 25-year-old has walked for the likes of Givenchy, John Paul Gaultier and Stella 
McCartney, and  she also appeared on the runway during H&M's inaugural 
show.

In Milan this season she appeared
 at Balmain, walked for Gucci, Fendi and Versace and she was the star of
 Tom Ford's London show - that's 13 shows in total in under three weeks.

And now the famed model has revealed her secrets to having fun on the runway.

She said: 'I like to mess with the other girls.

'We stare each other out as we walk past and try to make the other girl smile. I play with Karlie [Kloss], but she has her game face on and never cracks, but on Karmen [Pedaru] and Abbey Lee [Kershaw] it works.

Messing around: Joan says she tries to make pal Karlie Kloss laugh on the catwalk

'The trick is to do it when you’re going back and they are coming towards the camera, so nobody knows it’s me!'

She may have numerous campaigns under her belt (she is currently the face of H&M denim, and is also starring in campaigns for Prabal Gurung and Estée Lauder) but Joan is still thinking big for the future.

'I think of myself as an empire. I am super- ambitious, but also believe in superstition, so I never show all my cards.

'It is about being associated with luxury brands, being in fragrance and cosmetic campaigns, or creating your own line of whatever it may be, so people associate your name with something, rather than what you are just the face of.'

The It crowd: Models Lily Donaldson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Joan Smalls hang out together a lot

The Mario Testino for MATE collection 
features abstract and enlarged sections of Testino’s exhibition, Alta 
Moda which opens on April 18th, 2013 at Avenido Pedro de Osma in Lima, 
Peru.

Alta Moda is a series of photographic portraits of Peruvians 
wearing traditional and festive attire from the mountainous region of 
Cusco.

To create Alta Moda, Testino made several trips to Cusco city 
over a five-year period after discovering an archive of costumes from 
the region.

The exclusive capsule collection 
includes silk and cotton blend kaftans, silk scarves, tote bags and 
clutches. Jewellery is designed by Vicki Beamon with a modern take on 
Peruvian craft.

Mario Testino’s book, Alta Moda will also be available 
to purchase from net-a-porter.

Holli Rogers, Fashion Director, net-a-porter, said: 'We are huge fans of Mario’s photography and are 
delighted to be able to offer our customers the opportunity to wear his 
works of art.

'The color and detail in the Peruvian costumes are 
unbelievable and this has paved the way for a fun range of clothing, 
bags and jewellery.'

 20 percent of net sales profits will be donated to 
MATE
