Former paratrooper Paddy Doyle, 49, from Solihull, West Midlands, has 
been entered into the Guinness World Records 63 times for a series of 
endurance challenges

Mr Doyle, from Solihull, West Midlands, has even broken 31 records this year alone, mostly for cross-country runs while carrying weights on his back. 

As well as his 55 Guinness World Records, Mr Doyle also holds another 149 records which have been 
recognised by other record-breaking bodies.

The fitness fanatic began training for the endurance challenges after a stint in the army, which he left in April 1986, where he said he learned about discipline and keeping fit.

His first endurance challenge was in May 1987, when he completed 4,100 press ups with a 50lb steel weight on his back in four-and-a-half hours.

To keep in shape for the challenges, Mr Doyle trains six times per week week for two hours at a time. He usually works out in his gym which he has built in his back garden.

His exact regime depends on what challenge he is working towards, but can include hill training and long cross country walks, carrying heavy backpacks full of weights.

The fitness fanatic completed his first endurance challenge in 1987 and now holds 212 records, as recognised by six different record-holding bodies

He said: 'I can’t be built like a fridge, I have to keep my weight down because I compete in endurance challenges.

'I eat white meat, Quorn meals and definitely no red meat. If I feel like I fancy a treat I have one because I know I’ll work hard to burn it off.

'You have to have discipline and I don’t train in the mornings because it’s dangerous, your body is still warming up.

'Look at poor Rik Mayall, he died after a morning run. I train in the afternoons, sometimes for half-an-hour or sometimes for two hours.'

Mr Doyle, who began his challenges after a stint in the army, has broken 31 records this year alone, mainly for cross-country runs carrying weights on his back

For his fuel, Mr Doyle eats large meals of high-fibre and high-protein food, including a four-course meal for breakfast, which consists of porridge, Quorn sausages, toast and six bananas.

For lunch, part of his meal includes peanut butter spread on cornflakes and doused in milk. He also supplements his diet with Cod Liver Oil tablets.

When he is not training, Mr Doyle works as a security trainer and teaches survival skills and outdoor education at colleges across the UK.

Breakfast: Porridge, Quorn sausages, a few slices of wholemeal toast and six bananas. He also takes Cod Liver Oil.

Lunch: Salad, peanut butter on cornflakes with milk, two cups of tea and pitta bread.

Dinner: Chicken and fish with boiled rice, or spaghetti bolognese made with Quorn mince.

Daily training: Two-hour afternoon session of gym work or a cross-country run carrying a bag full of weights.

During his time serving with the Parachute Regiment, Mr Doyle represented the battalion in army cross country competitions.

He
 also was a regular visitor to the army prison cells for disorderly 
conduct fighting with Military Police and other soldiers from other 
units.

As well as his endurance sport career, he has also gained a Black Belt Level Three Dan in free style martial arts.

The
 world record regulatory bodies which have endorsed Mr Doyle's attempts are
 Record Holders Republic, Guinness World Records, Record Setters and 
Record Holders.
