Police in Mississippi said Friday that Mississippi attorney Mark Mayfield killed himself on Friday, following his arrest in a case that highlighted the smash-mouth political environment in the Deep South.

Mayfield was accused of conspiring with other tea party officials to take secret photographs of Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's bedridden wife in a nursing home.

The pictures were used in an online political video targeting the six-term senator.

Rose Cochran has lived in the nursing home since 2001 and reportedly suffers from severe dementia.

'MARK
 MAYFIELD HAS COMMITTED SUICIDE TEN MINUTES AGO,' Bruce wrote. 'SHOT 
HIMSELF IN THE HEAD IN HIS GARAGE. FAMILY JUST CALLED ME. OH LORD,,,,OH 
LORD.'

'Deborah and [I] are saddened to hear of the loss of Mark Mayfield,' Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement.

'He was a long-time friend, and he will be missed. Our prayers go out to his family in this tragic moment.'

U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran appeared to win his Republcian primary run-off on Tuesday against tea party-backed Chris McDaniel in a campaign that has seen dirty tricks on both sides

Cochran appeared to win a primary run-off on Tuesday against tea party darling Chris McDaniel, a state legislator. But McDaniel hasn't conceded the race and may challenge it before the result is certified on July 3.

His campaign claims that pro-Cochran forces organized thousands of Democrats to cross party lines and support Cochran in the Republican primary, voting illegally after they had already cast ballots in the June 10 Democratic primary.

About 61,000 more people voted in the runoff than in the Republican Primary, a development that hasn't been seen in Mississippi since 1984.

Political shenanigans tied to Cochran's side of the race include racially charged 'robocalls' and radio ads, paid for by a PAC friendly to Cochran and founded by former Gov. Haley Barbour, which encouraged Democrats in primarily black precincts to cast ballots for Cochran.

One radio ad claimed that supporters of McDaniel had connections to the Ku Klux Klan, and that McDaniel had a 'racist agenda.'
