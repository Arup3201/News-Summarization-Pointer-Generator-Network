Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from Barack Obama over the situation in Syria - saying she pushed to arm moderate Syrians, but was overruled by the President.

Mrs Clinton - a potential presidential candidate for 2016 - made her differences with Mr Obama clear.

But, though the suggestion was made, she did not go so far as to say whether different foreign policy could have prevented the rise of jihadist militants now causing chaos in Syria and Iraq.

In a TV interview she said: 'We pushed very hard. But as I say in my book, I believe that Harry Truman was right, the buck stops with the president'.

Not our fault; Clinton said the decision to yank American troops out of Iraq, taken while she was secretary of state, belonged to Iraq itself, not to the U.S.

Clinton, who is on the fence about running for president in 2016, fielded questions moderated by CNN's Christiane Amanpour while wearing a Ralph Lauren suit

Mrs Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she joined forces with Pentagon and CIA chiefs to persuade Obama to arm rebels opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but that the White House resisted.

Speaking on CNN, she said: 'It's very difficult, in retrospect, to say that would have prevented this.'

The former secretary of state, senator and first lady has been offering views that differ from Obama's on foreign policy in recent months, including on issues such as Iran's nuclear program and dealings with Russian president Vladimir Putin.

However, she stood by the President in another segment of the interviewing, suggesting that Mr Obama bears no responsibility for his decision to pull American troops out of
Iraq at the end of 2011.

That decision, which created a power vacuum in the country, has also contributed to the rise of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) militants.

'In retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government,'
she said.

Mrs Clinton was referring to the two governments' failure to
sign a mutual Status of Forces Agreement, a document that would have kept
American servicemen and women in Iraq as a stabilizing force after 2011.

Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly balked on a
U.S. proposal because it would have included legal immunity for American troops
who broke local laws.

ISIS has seized American-made tanks and weapons along its push toward Baghdad -- materiel transferred to the Iraqi army before Obama ordered a troop pullout in 2011

Iraq has descended into chaos in recent weeks, with ISIS seizing cities and presiding over mass executions of Iraqi soldiers.

The group aims to institute an Islamic 'caliphate' – a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries – held together by strict Shariah law.

The United States has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf in the last week while Mr Obama decides whether to engage ISIS with airstrikes.

The White House said Monday that Mr Obama had sent 275 troops into Baghdad to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting.

On Tuesday ISIS reached within 60 miles of Iraq's capital city.

Much of their advance has come with the help of American arms, tanks, rockets and other war materiel, seized as Iraqi army regulars and reserves fled.

Mrs Clinton entered the stage for the event, moderated by CNN's
Christiane Amanpour, to wild applause and an extended
ovation.

Commenting on Monday's capture of Abu Khattalah, an accused
ringleader of the 2012 attack on America's diplomatic station in
Benghazi, Libya, she said she was 'very pleased.'

'This is another indication ... that the United States has
an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for
attacks on Americans,' Mrs Clinton said.

And commenting on the nearly two years that have passed, in
which Khattalah openly operated in Libya and gave media interviews while
wipping strawberry frappes in cafes, she insisted that no one in the federal
government slow-walked the Benghazi investigation.

'It took more than ten years to being Osama Bin Laden to
Justice,' Mrs Clinton said.

Mrs Clinton gave prominent mention to a State Department
Accountability Review Board report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing
related to the Benghazi facilities' lack of security on the eleventh
anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks.

That investigation, however, has come under fire for failing
to interview Mrs Clinton.

She said she feels the pain of the mothers and family
members of the four Americans who died in the Benghazi conflagration, caused by
the Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah.

'I can see why she and others are inconsolable,' Mrs Clinton
said. 

But 'we need to be in dangerous places ... We're doing the
best we can to find out what happened. There's a lot we don’t know'. 

'Now that we have Khattalah in custody, hopefully we will
learn more from his perspective.'

The U.S. government, she assured viewers, wants to know
'what the motivations of the leaders, of the attackers, happened to be.'

Mrs Clinton has been widely criticized for claiming in the early
days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-Islam video
attacked the Benghazi compound, and not a premeditated terrorist group.

No one asked her about that awkward chapter.
