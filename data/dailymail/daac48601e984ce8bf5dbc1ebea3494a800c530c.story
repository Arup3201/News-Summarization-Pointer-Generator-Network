Much of the East Coast was chilled down this weekend by an early Nor'easter that brought unseasonably cold weather to the region. But Maine was the hardest hit, with much of the central and eastern parts of the state receiving more about a foot of snow.

The snow started falling around 8am Sunday morning, and didn't stop until early Monday. While most of the snowfall had stopped my noon on Monday, 80,000 residents were still without power thanks to 40mph gusts and heavy snow which knocked down trees and power lines. 

All of this happened seven weeks ahead of winter, which officially starts December 21, and pictures posted online Monday morning show a strange mix of fall foliage above a thick blanket of snow on the ground.

Getting their shovels out early: Much of Maine was covered in a foot of snow on Sunday, during an early Nor'easter storm. Above, residents in Palermo, Maine dig out snow on their property on Sunday  

Road block: The heavy and wet snow combined with gusts over 40mph caused trees to fall on the road and downed power lines throughout the region, leaving some 80,000 without power Monday morning 

Time for snow tires: The snow-packed roads caused about a dozen car accidents on Sunday, but most appeared to be minor. Above, police officers help drivers after a two vehicle accident in Winslow, Maine on Sunday

Crash: This truck slid off snow covered U.S. Route 202 in Troy, struck a tree stump and came to rest on top of it on Sunday. A nearby motorist said the driver was not injured and had given him a ride to his nearby home

Cary, Maine, near the northeastern border with Canada, received the most snow with a whopping 21 inches on the first weekend of November. Eighteen other towns in Maine recorded 12 inches or more of snow in the storm. 

The towns of Bangor and Caribou both set records for earliest double-digit snowfall days, with 12 inches and 10.1 inches respectively, the National Weather Service office in Caribou announced.

The counties of Penobscot, Hancock, Knox, and Lincoln were the hardest hit. 

On Sunday, Governor  Paul LePage announced a state of emergency, when some 130,000 were out of power.

Stranded in the snow: Paul Chesser waits for a wrecker to pull his car onto Route 3 in China, Maine on Sunday.  Chesser, a nurse, was returning from work treating veterans at Togus VA when he slid into the ditch

White out: Maine State Trooper Donald Webb signals for drivers to stop in white out conditions at an accident on Route 3 in China. Maine residents were encouraged to stay off the roads during the worst of the storm 

Tree down: A tree in Brewer, Maine appears to have brought down a power line in the storm. The damage pictured above on Monday morning 

'Our first concern is to get power back on for Mainers. Please stay safe and keep off the roads to allow utility crews to do their work,' the governor said. 

'The storm will leave the state overnight, but getting power restored is expected to take several days,' he added in a news release. 

The snow that fell Sunday was a heavy, wet, snow that caused trees and power lines to fall on the roads, leading to widespread power outages and about a dozen car accidents.

Two seasons at once: On Monday morning, many Mainers took to Instagram sharing pictures of the fall foliage mixed with the early snow. The above Instagram user wrote: 'Conflicting seasons? Is it winter or is it fall?'

Snowy Halloweekend: A ski resort in Bethel, Maine opened on Monday due to the storm, and offered free skiing to anyone who showed up wearing a Halloween costume. Above, a leftover jack-o-lantern from Halloween is seen covered in snow on Sunday in Waterville, Maine

One car accident involved a police cruiser, which was hit by a falling tree on Black Point Road. The officer was not injured, but the car's windshield was cracked, the Press-Herald reported. 

The winds were even worse off the coast of Maine where gusts reached 60 mph near Matinicus Island. Margaret Curtis of the National Weather Service reported that waves in the Gulf of Maine were more than 22 feet high. 

'Those are obviously monster waves,' Curtis told the Press-Herald. 'I just hope that everyone heeded warnings and came into port.'

Those conditions caused the U.S. Coast Guard to suspend the search Sunday afternoon for two fisherman believed to be lost at sea off Matinicus Island. One of the fishermen on board the fishing vessel No Limits was rescued from the waters, but the two others were believed to be on board.

'First storm... We do it right here in Maine! Trees down, power out, fires roaring,' an Instagram user wrote on Sunday, as the storm battered the coastal town of Rockland

The early snow ended up being a positive for winter sports lovers. The Sunday River ski resort in Bethel opened early on Monday and announced that anyone who showed up in a Halloween costume would get to ski for free.

The temperature in Maine is expected to rise by mid-week, just before another storm is forecast to roll in on Thursday

Snow was also seen much further south in the Carolinas, and the cold front made for a particularly frigid New York City Marathon on Sunday.
