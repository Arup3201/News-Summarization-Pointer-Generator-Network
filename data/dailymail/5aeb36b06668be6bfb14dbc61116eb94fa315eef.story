Wildlife officials are hunting the shooters of a 200-pound black bear who reportedly removed the animal's claws before dumping him on a bench at a college campus overnight.

A groundskeeper at North Carolina State University's Raleigh campus found the dead creature propped up on a bench in the common area about 8am this morning.

State wildlife commission spokesman Jeff Cantrell said the adult male bear was in good health when it was shot off-campus, and he wasn't sure how long he had been left on the seat

Tragic: A 200-pound black bear that had been shot dead was found dumped on a bench in the common area of  North Carolina State University's Raleigh campus about 8am this morning

Scene: Wildlife officials said they don't know how long the bear, who was found by the university's groundskeeper this morning, had been left on the bench

A witness told WRAL News that the bear's claws had been removed - a report wildlife officials have not confirmed.

'That's something that will be determined through the investigation,' enforcement officer Brent Ward said.

Student Jesse Ditillo said she was walking across campus when she saw the massive animal.

'From
 far away, we weren't really sure what it was,' she told WRAL News. 'But we 
wandered by and it was there. It's a college campus and weird things 
happen.'

North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission officials took the bear to the school's veterinary school, where a necropsy will be performed.

Ward said the court-imposed fine for killing bears out of season ranges from $500 to $10,000.

The courts could also order the culprits to pay the cost of replacing a black bear, which is a minimum of $2,230.
