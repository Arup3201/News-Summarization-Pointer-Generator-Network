A women's England football team star who is also a member of a campaign group fighting to stop racism in sport has been forced to apologise after blacking up as Whoopi Goldberg in the film Sister act.

England Forward Toni Duggan posed for the photograph in Cyprus at a squad party wearing a nun's habit and her face heavily-made up.

It later appeared on the photograph sharing network Instagram but has since been removed.

The 22-year-old Manchester City women's player is also a leading ambassador for the Kick It Out campaign which aims to stop racism in sport. 

The player often speaks at schools and colleges about the campaign.

Manchester City players Steph Houghton, 25, and Jill Scott, 27, also appear in the photograph dressed as characters from Disney's 101 Dalmatians. 

However, within hours of the photograph being posted online people took to Twitter to criticise the footballer's decision to black her face up.

One person tweeted: 'There aren't enough white people to dress up as?'

The shamed footballer later told The Mirror: 'I am very sorry for my actions and for any offence I may have caused.

'I would like to apologise wholeheartedly to England, my club and anyone else that I may have offended.

'I am proud to be a Next 20 ambassador for Kick It Out and take this role very seriously for an organisation that does such good work.'

A spokesperson for England's women's side said it was aware of the photographs and that the matter was being dealt with internally. 

A key player for the England youth teams in recent years, Duggan made her senior team debut in the European Championship qualifier against Croatia in September 2012.

She is expected to play today in Cyprus against Italy.
