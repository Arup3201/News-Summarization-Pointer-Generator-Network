Britain could be hit by power cuts if Labour moves to freeze bills, the head of energy giant Npower has warned.

Chief executive Paul Massara claimed the industry needed a ‘stable environment’ to commit to investment in the energy network.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to freeze bills for 20 months if he wins the 2015 general election.

Warning: Npower chief executive Paul Massara said future investment depended on stability, which Labour's price freeze would threaten

Npower has announced average price rises of 10.4 this winter, the highest of the Big Six made public so far.

It has triggered a major political row over government intervention in the market to curb crippling increases.

Sam Laidlaw, the boss of Centrica which owns British Gas, has promised not to take a bonus this year while families are ‘under pressure’.

But Mr Massara dismissed the idea as a ‘gimmick’ and insisted he would take his money.

And he claimed the lights could go out in the future unless there was a ‘stable environment’ for investment.

Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

He warned: ‘The amount of spare capacity to meet the peak requirement... has dropped from somewhere around 15 per cent to five.

‘That is extremely low by historical levels... and unless the UK can create a politically stable environment to attract new capital, that new capital will not come in.’

He told BBC's Hardtalk he earns about £600,000 a year, of which £150,000 is a bonus.

When asked if he would follow Centrica boss Mr Laidlaw, who on Monday said he would turn down his own bonus, Mr Massara said: ‘I think the issue is, are we doing absolutely everything we can to keep costs down and to make sure it's affordable?

‘Gimmicks of saying, 'I'm going to reduce my bonus' - if Sam was earning five million a year and he's willing to give a million, good for him.

‘My bonus is linked to my performance, is linked to getting it right for customers, is linked to employee satisfaction. All of my team are linked to that. If we don't deliver on that, we don't get a bonus.’

Pledge: Centrica's Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw told the CBI he will not accept a bonus this year, but will still take home millions

On Monday Mr Laidlaw said he had decided not to take his bonus, because there was a need for leadership at a time of public anger.

'Bonuses are independently set by our remuneration committee but in this environment there is a case for leadership.

‘Just
to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and 
assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration 
committees think about it,’ he said.
