Tokyo is hoping to cash in on its connection with Godzilla by creating a hotel dedicated to the sci-fi film of the same name.

The new look Godzilla themed Hotel Gracery in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward is dedicated to the mutant dinosaur that first destroyed the city in the 1954 film, and then went on to further destroy the city in numerous remakes over the years.

In fact, the giant reptilian creature has crushed just about every famous building in Japan including Tokyo Tower and the Parliament building.

Japan, the only nation in the world to suffer atomic bombings, has a soft spot for the fire-breathing creature as representing the suffering unleashed by nuclear weapons.

And according to market research, Godzilla could be a major tourist attraction for fans who would be keen to stay in the Godzilla Hotel.

Inside even the toilets are Godzilla themed, and there are rooms filled with Godzilla memorabilia inside the 30 story hotel.

And with a copy of the monster's head on top of the hotel, they promise to have the best views in the city.

The hotel is on the top of the Shinjuku's Toho Cinema, where fans can watch the various Godzilla films in all their glory, and a viewing platform for fans to get up close and personal with the monster or at least its head for a selfie with a little bit extra.

Price for the rooms in the hotel which opens on 24th of April are around £200 on weekdays and £300 on public holidays and weekends.

Hotel Gracery spokesman Eigo Ueda said: 'This Godzilla head is part of our strategy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when many foreign tourists will visit and we want to provide the best experience to them. What better way than to appeal to tourists with a giant Godzilla figure.'

They also hoping to cash in with a further Godzilla movie set to appear in Japan next year. The announcement this week from Japanese film studio Toho comes after the success earlier this year of the Hollywood Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards, which grossed more than £320 million ($500million) worldwide.

Toho said in 2004 it had made its last Godzilla film, the 28th in the series centred on the irradiated monster, which first stomped into the world in 1954. Over the years, Godzilla movies fell out of favour even among Japanese fans.

But the latest Hollywood Godzilla, complete with spikes down its back and a terrifying roar, received relatively favourable reviews in Japan, unlike the 1998 Hollywood Godzilla, directed by Roland Emmerich, which purist fans hated.

Toho said recent innovations in computer-graphics technology were behind its decision to revive Godzilla.

The Toho Godzilla is set for release in 2016, before Edwards releases his sequel for Legendary Pictures and Warner Brothers in 2018.

The Tokyo-based company, which owns the rights for Godzilla, declined to say whether it would bring back the man-in-a-rubber suit behind the original Godzilla or rely on computer graphics - or have both.

The widely praised original black-and-white 'Godzilla' was directed by Ishiro Honda.

Other directors took over for the subsequent Japanese works, which at times became absurdly comical, featuring battles with manga-like, or cartoonish, monsters.
