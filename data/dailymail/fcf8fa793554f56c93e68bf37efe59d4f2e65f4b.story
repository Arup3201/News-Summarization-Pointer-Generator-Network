A British mother who was jailed in the Dominican Republic for killing her husband is back home in Britain today after she was let out of prison and jumped bail.

Nicole Reyes from Rumney in Cardiff, was given a 12-year prison sentence in February for the voluntary manslaughter of her husband Jorge on the island in July 2012, after he died in a car crash.

Her family in Britain raised the £62,000 needed for her to be released on bail and it was posted to authorities on the Caribbean island.

But as they freed her without confiscating her passport, her friends in the Dominican Republic kept her in a safe house while they arranged for her to fly home.

She is still officially on bail pending an appeal against her conviction, but now she is back in Britain, her family believe her ordeal is over.

The 38-year-old, who has two children, has now been reunited with her family in Wales and was checked over by doctors after spending two years in a cramped cell with 15 other women. 

Her mother 
Jeannette Clements, 62, who has campaigned tirelessly for her daughter's
 release said it was the end of a 'hellish nightmare' for the family. 

She explained: 'We scraped bail money together from wherever we could - we borrowed from family and sold our furniture.

'Nothing mattered as much as getting Nicole home.

'When we had the £62,000 we handed it over and waited. It was all in the hands of our lawyer and that was so hard.

'We waited for news and then finally heard that Nicole was free.

'She was taken to a safe house in the Dominican Republic while we organised her a flight out of there.

'She didn't have to hand over her passport or sign a form to say where she'd be.

'All the prison authorities wanted from us was the money.'

Mrs Reyes was accused of deliberately running over her husband in her SUV as he rode beside her on a motorbike after a night out.

But she claimed she accidentally hit his motorcycle as he swerved out of the way of an oncoming car in July 2012.

Police arrived on the scene and are said to have told Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital, but took her to a prison instead.

She was facing 30 years in jail for murder but at her two-and-a-half hour trial in February, the charge was reduced to voluntary homicide and she was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

But her family was told Mrs Reyes, who has a serious kidney illness, could still be freed on bail for a sum of £62,000 pending her appeal.

Mrs Clements and Mrs Reyes' stepfather Mike, who live in Cardiff raised the money and she was let out of prison last week.

She was reunited with her children Leah, 19, and Luke, 18, who had visited her while she was held in a 15 foot square cell on the holiday island.

The former holiday rep has also become a grandmother since her imprisonment but had only ever seen pictures of her baby grandson.

Her mother added: 'We got her through the door after midnight on Saturday and drank champagne together and cried tears of relief.

'I didn't want her out of my sight. I could hardly take it in.

'Seeing Nicole with her baby grandson for the first time was the most beautiful blessing.

'After a long and hard battle to get her home my mind is struggling to keep up.

'She's stood in front of me but I can hardly believe my eyes.

Mrs Reyes first went to the Dominican Republic on holiday and later took a holiday rep job. She lived in this house with her husband Jorge

'Two weeks ago she was curled up in a ball crying to me that she thought she was going to die.

'Now she is home we can get her the medical attention she has been so desperate for.

'I can't tell you what it means to me that she is back where she belongs.

'We are all walking around dazed, it feels like a miracle after the journey we've had."

Mrs Reyes first went to the Dominican Republic on holiday and later took a holiday rep job with Thomas Cook where she met Jorge, a 37-year-old coconut water salesman.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that a British National has been released from prison in the Dominican Republic pending a further appeal.

'We continue to provide consular assistance.'
