There is no hiding from the impact that Luis Suarez made at Liverpool. Richard Scudamore, banging the Premier League drum last week, suggested his departure would not hurt the organisation of which he is chief executive. But at Liverpool, even three bites down the line, they view things rather differently.

‘He was a wonderful talent and a wonderful player,’ said Brendan Rodgers. ‘I’m sure most of the Premier League will miss him.’

For Rodgers, last season was the fairytale without the happy ending. No one in the modern era of the Premier League has risen from seventh to second without a huge cash injection from a benefactor.

The fact that Liverpool came within a whisker of winning the title, something most people assumed would have been beyond them for years, made the achievement all the more laudable.

Now though, as they take on Southampton at Anfield on Sunday, they must do it all again and this time without one of the world’s great players. Rodgers must strike a balance: being appreciative of what Suarez did for the club while not letting the new group of players obsess on his departure.

‘We gave him everything in support,’ said Rodgers. The Liverpool manager was watching England v Costa Rica when news came through of the latest biting incident of his star player, though by then the wheels were already in motion from Suarez’s side for the move to Barcelona.

‘Luis was a great servant for us in the period he was here. We propelled him from a player some people had never heard of when he came into a world-class player. In the last two seasons in particular his game has been phenomenal. As a club, a city and as supporters we couldn’t have done any more. It was time for both to part and we will continue to grow and get stronger.

‘He would get a great reception [if he came back]. Every time he stepped on to the pitch he gave his life to the team. I can never forget his training. You talk about top players helping develop the younger players and I see the attitude of some of our younger players because they’ve worked with the likes of Luis and Steven Gerrard, who give 150 per cent every single day. That was Luis Suarez.’

It puts you in mind of Eric Cantona, another iconic player who left English football prematurely but whose influence continued at Manchester United in David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary and Phil Neville, all of whom cite the Frenchman’s attitude to training as a key influence in their careers. Perhaps Suarez can do the same for Liverpool.

‘Yes, I think he will do,’ said Rodgers. ‘Look at players who were close to him, like young [Philippe] Coutinho, and I know he’s learned from him. He wants to be out training every day. Never misses a day, tries to be better every day, looks after himself. I know Luis was a big influence on him.’

There are others who can pick up the mantle. Liverpool, who completed the signing of Sevilla’s £12million defender Alberto Moreno yesterday, have spent about £100m on eight players this summer — three of them from Southampton, making today something of an old boys’ reunion.

Rodgers though dismisses the obvious comparison with Tottenham last season, who sold Gareth Bale and signed a similar number of replacements, unsuccessfully.

‘It’s totally different,’ he said. ‘We’ve gone into the Champions League for the first time since 2009. We had a terrific season but the depth of our squad was frighteningly shallow. So we needed to improve the quality but the net spend is very small. It was part of the vision and strategy of the club in terms of what we were trying to do.

‘It’s not as if we’re bringing them straight into the team. We’ve still got our core. It’s not a new team, it’s an evolving team. It’s a totally different scenario. We are clear in our identity of how we play and how we work.

‘We’ve done some great work over the past year in terms of planning for this moment. We knew that this was a big summer for us and if you look at the age group of the players, this will probably be the biggest window that we may have for a few seasons. But we knew that we needed it — it was too late to do it in January.’

After the World Cup, there is a theory that players from less-exalted football countries have to keep working harder for longer to make the grade and Rodgers agrees. ‘We don’t have that here. You’re part of the most brilliant league in the world, the most competitive league in the world.’

He added: ‘We want to be winners, we know that we’re on the way to challenging, which is the most important thing for us.’
