Five children were injured along with an adult after a chairlift failed at a ski resort.

Dozens of other people had to be rescued when they were left dangling mid-air at Lecht Ski Centre in Corgarff, Aberdeenshire, yesterday.

The five children, who were as young as nine, and the man were injured when they fell 20ft onto the mountainside, crashing to the ground.

Some of the injured were airlifted to hospital amid fears of spinal injuries following the accident at 3.25pm.

After the casualties had been dealt 
with, rescuers could finally turn their attention to the day trippers – 
including children – trapped 20ft up on the broken lift in sub-zero wind
chill conditions.

Among them was a small boy on his own in a chair, whose father tried to comfort him from the ground.

Last night, it was unclear exactly what had happened – but Health and Safety investigators will visit the scene this morning.

In a statement published on its Facebook page, the company involved Lecht 2090 said it did not know what caused the malfunction.

An investigation is due to take place by the Health and Safety Executive and the chairlift, which is the only lift of its kind at the ski resort, is expected to remain closed for some time.

The statement read: 'Some of you might know there was an incident with the chairlift this afternoon (Tuesday) where six people were injured.

'We are extremely upset that these people have been injured but as yet we don't [know] the cause of the problem with the chair.

'The first response was to look after the injured. The rest of the skiers were then taken off the chairlift by the two Lecht teams within around one hour and 20 minutes.

'A major incident was called by the company to alert all the other emergency agents who reacted quickly. The chair will be out of action for a while but the rest of the lifts will be working as normal.'

Jennifer Johnston and her family, from
nearby Hatton of Fintray, were  skiing in the area – and her 
15-year-old son Calum was on a lift parallel to the chairlift that broke
down.

He described one chair becoming detached from the main line and causing a pile-up.

Police, ambulances, firefighters and mountain rescue teams dealt with those trapped at the scene

Calum said: 'I looked over at the chairlift and saw one caught in the pylon cable.

'Then another one came up behind it and also got caught, then there was a third chair. They were all bundled up together.

'I heard a crunch and soon after the 
cable released. There was  groaning as it was on the ground, although 
there was no screaming when it fell – it happened too quickly.'

Mrs Johnston added: 'We skied away and could see where one of the cables had come off the pylon.

'One chair was detached from the cable and had stopped progression up the hill, and other chairs had got tangled in the cable.

'One of the most upsetting things was a
little boy all on his own on a chair much higher up. His dad was on the
ground trying to comfort him and throw him gloves.'

The Lecht Ski Centre, with 20 runs, is on the eastern side of the Cairngorms in Strathdon and began operating in the mid-1970s.

Derailment: The incident was the result of a 'suspected derailment' at the Lecht Ski Centre near Tomintoul in Aberdeenshire

Yesterday, it was particularly busy with families because of the February half-term school holidays.

More than 30 adults and children were left trapped when the mechanism ground to a halt.

Police said a calm descended as several doctors who were skiing in the area rushed to help, pre- empting emergency services.

Four ambulances, two fire engines, 
several police cars, three Mountain Rescue Teams, an air ambulance and a
Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet were scrambled to help with the 
rescue.

The six casualties, suffering broken 
bones and spinal injuries, were taken by helicopter and ambulance to 
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

Busy: CCTV pictures from shortly before the incident show a thick coating of snow on the hills, with numerous of people using the resort's facilities

Rescue: According to reports, six people were injured in the incident and 36 people had to rescued by emergency services

None of the injuries is thought to be life-threatening.

After the stranded skiers were rescued, they were checked over  by medics at the ski centre and allowed home.

Last night, a spokesman for the ski 
centre said: 'All the casualties are in a stable condition; three were 
taken to hospital by helicopter and three by ambulance.

'Staff evacuated 36 people who were stuck on the other chairlifts and everyone was off the slope within an hour and 40 minutes.

'The Health and Safety Executive and the Lecht will be investigating the cause of the accident.'

Grampian Police Chief Inspector Willie Findlay said: 'A number of doctors who were skiing were quickly on scene.'
