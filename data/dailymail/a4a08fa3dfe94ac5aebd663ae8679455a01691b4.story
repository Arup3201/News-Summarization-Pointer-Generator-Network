It was once described as a 'building of world significance' and was seen as such a striking example of modern architecture that it was given the highest possible protection for buildings in Scotland.

In its 1960s heyday the entire hierarchy of the Scottish Catholic Church attended a ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone at St Peter's Seminary near Cardross in Argyll before it was to become a key centre for the training of Roman Catholic priests.

But 50 years on the seminary is a ghost of its former grandeur, abandoned and desolate with the once decadent walls covered with graffiti and its distinctive corridors and halls littered with rubbish and overgrown weeds.

St Peters Seminary in Argyll was once voted Scotland's best building and regarded as of world architectural significance after it was built in the 1960s, but 50 years on the site has been abandoned and left littered with graffiti on most of the walls and rubbish throughout its corridors

St Peter's Seminary was so highly regarded that it was listed category A, the highest level of protection for a building of architectural interest

Trainee priests are no longer seen on the staircases and in rooms of St Peters. 

Today the abandoned seminary is mostly occupied by the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts. 

Winding staircases have been partially destroyed, doorways and walls left to rot and crumble, and discarded stone and litter is all over the floors of the vast site. Most of the woodwork and glass has now disappeared but evidence of the distinctive architecture remains. 

Now its only visitors are urban explorers, desperate to reinvigorate a building that was once seen as so important in brutalist architecture. 

The building was officially opened in 1964 after it was built to replace the Roman Catholic seminary previously housed in Bearsden in Glasgow, which was destroyed by a fire in 1946.

In 1964 Archbishop Scanlan laid the foundation stone at St Peters, before the entire hierarchy of the Scottish Catholic church.

Urban explorers have captured the destruction of the building, with corridors littered with discarded stone and walls left to rot and crumble 

The building in Argyll in Scotland has been praised for its modernist design and was afforded the highest protection as a Category A building  

Graffiti now covers many walls at St Peters but there are attempts being made to restore it to its former glory and appreciate the architecture

It had a capacity of 100 students but was never full as the number of students joining the priesthood started to decline in the 1960s.  

The building has been praised for its modernist design by Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein of architecture firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia in the early 1960s. And it was later described as a modern 'building of world significance' becoming one of only 42 post-war buildings in Scotland to be listed at Category A, the highest level of protection for a building of 'special architectural or historic interest'.

After it was opened the seminary became part of St Peter's College and was used as a training ground for young priests. 

It closed in 1980 and was briefly used as a drug rehabilitation centre until it was shut down in 1987. 

Since then it has been unused, despite attempts to reinvigorate it and try to turn it into something resembling its former glory. 

The site of St Peter's Seminary in Argyll is surrounded by trees and close to Kilmahew House, which was targeted by arsonists in 1995

It has been occupied by the homeless and luckily escaped an arson attack at nearby Kilmahew House in 1995.

But despite being abandoned and on the cusp of ruin, the building has still retained its lure for lovers of architecture.  

Urban explorers have constantly visited the site during the almost 30 years it has sat abandoned. In 2005 it was voted Scotland's best modern building by the readers of Prospect Magazine. 

One explorer, who didn't wish to be named, said: 'It's such an incredible structure and it seems mad that it's just been lying empty for all this time.

'Just by walking around, you can tell that it was once this grand building. It's fascinating to see what has happened to the place over the years.

Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein, who have both since died, designed St Peter's seminary in Argyll which is due to be redeveloped 

Mould and weeds cover the walls of St Peter's in Scotland, making it a shadow of its former glory as a thriving part of St Peter's College

The site has been abandoned for almost 30 years after a brief spell when it was used as a drug rehabilitation centre until 1989 when it closed 

St Peter's Seminary in Argyll still attracts urban explorers wowed by its architecture and was voted Scotland's best modern building in 2005 

'I really hope that someone can salvage this after it being dormant for so long.'

There have been several attempts to reinvigorate life into the building with the most recent effort being by Glasgow based public arts project NVA.

They appear to be the most likely group to restore the the seminary to something resembling its former glory, having raised £5 million so far for a project promising to turn it into a 'vibrant arts landscape'. 

However this will never be seen by the designers of the building who have died since it was constructed.
