These are the dramatic scenes which confronted almost 100 firefighters when they were called to tackle a blaze at a historic thatched cottage.

Huge clouds of thick smoke and fierce flames engulfed the chocolate-box property situated in the heart of the New Forest.

Firefighters rushed to put of the flames, after the blaze broke out at the home in Brockenhurst, Hampshire, and quickly spread to the thatched roof.

Mission: More than 90 firefighters rushed to this historic thatched cottage when it was engulfed by flames

The first fire crews to arrive at the scene immediately asked for reinforcements and a total of 14 fire engines rushed to the blaze.

Extra appliances were also needed to ferry water to the cottage because of low pressure.

A spokesman for the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said that the alarm was raised at 7.10pm on Monday night, and crews were unable to scale down their operation until after 1am this morning.

'The response swiftly escalated to 
seven pumps, the multi-role vehicle and water carriers for additional 
water supplies,' he said.

'Then a further five appliances due to the serious nature of this incident.'

Fortunately there was no one at home at the time of the fire.

The cause of the fire was being investigated today by fire officers, but was not thought to be suspicious.

A smouldering mattress and charred bed frame had been removed from the burning cottage at the height of the blaze.

Aftermath: Although the walls of the building survived the devastating fire, the roof was completely destroyed

The two burning bedroom items were 
placed on the lawn in front of the quintessentially English cottage as 
firefighters tried to save the rest of the building.

Although fire crews were able to save the walls of the property, by the time all the flames had been put out the roof was completely destroyed.

A
neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'We looked out of the 
window and saw lots of smoke but not any flames. It's unexpected.'

Allan Hendry watched the dramatic scenes unfold in North Weir, Brockenhurst.

'It's tragic and no one deserves to have that happen to them. We saw smoke everywhere but didn't see the flames.

'It's not expected but you do worry with thatched roofs.

'There were a huge number of firefighters down here.'

Another neighbour said: 'It's absolutely horrendous. It makes you think if it'll take months or years to repair the house, if it can be repaired.'
