The headmaster of a leading public school has been sacked days after the start of a new term, after saying that the boys there 'just don't work hard enough'.

Chris Davis, 53, had come from Eton College to lead the prestigious Sherborne School, and hoped to raise academic standards by cramming more academic work into his students' days.

But on Friday the governors of the £32,850-per-year school announced that Mr Davis had left.

Sherborne, which was founded in 1550 by Edward VI in the Dorset village of the same name, has educated prominent churchmen and army generals, as well as famous figures such as codebreaker Alan Turing and Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville and Coldplay singer Chris Martin.

It was also meant to become the alma mater of novelist Evelyn Waugh, but he was stopped from attending after his brother published a novel in 1917 alluding to homosexual activity at the school.

The only reason given for his departure by the governors was that the school needed a change of 'strategic direction of the leadership.'

However, it had previously been suggested that many parents and boys resented Mr Davis' frequent comparisons with Eton, and the notion that Sherborne may be 'second best'.

 Sources close to the school say that attempts to change the way the institution worked stoked resentment among pupils and long-serving staff.

 A statement posted to the school's website insisted: 'There is absolutely no element whatsoever of untoward activity on the part of the outgoing Headmaster, or any other member of the staff, that has led to or contributed to this decision.'

Speaking to The Times, Mr Davis's wife Innes, 52, declined to comment on the reasoning behind the departure. 

Mr Davis previously taught at Eton, where he himself was educated. He joined after a career in the City, and was the head of Warre House, of which David Cameron was a member in the 1980s.

During his tenure, which began in 2010, the school had enjoyed strong academic results. More than 90 per cent of A-level papers this year marks at the A*, A or B grade.

Chair of the school's board of governors Gordon Parry released a statement saying the process for appointing a new headteacher had begun. 

He added: 'Our intent is to have made this appointment by the end of this Michaelmas term.

'We are delighted to announce that, in the meantime, Ralph Barlow, currently deputy head will serve as headmaster.'

Sherborne School has educated prominent figures for hundreds of years, and recent success stories to issue from its 15th-century halls include actors, authors and musicians.

Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham in Downton Abbey, attended the school, as did thespian Jeremy Irons and Dad's Army actor John Le Mesurier.

Alan Turing, the mathematician who helped defeat the Nazi's enigma code and turn the tide of the Second World War, also attended Sherborne.

The school has a strong pedigree in the arts, having educated spy novelist John le Carré and poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, father to Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis. Coldplay singer Chris Martin was also a student there. 

The institution's website includes military luminaries Major General Patrick Cordingley, Major General Julian Thompson and Lieutenant General David Leakey, the prestigious usher of the Black Rod in Parliament.

The school has enjoyed strong academic performance recently. On A-Level results day it was announced that 40 per cent of all grades were A*s or As, with six boys meeting offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge.

At GCSE this year half of boys achieved A*s in science subjects, with 11 high-achievers scoring straight A*/A grades.
