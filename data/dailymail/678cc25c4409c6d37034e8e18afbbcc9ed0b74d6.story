Doctors should order obese patients to undertake keep-fit classes in public parks, a new report says today.

The influential think tank Policy Exchange urges ministers to adopt the New Zealand system of ‘green prescriptions’ where doctors are encouraged to try non-medical alternatives to curing problems like obesity.

The potentially humiliating idea of forcing the overweight to exercise in public is likely to prove controversial with some.

But the centre-right think tank, which enjoys close links to the Tory leadership, says it will produce a number of benefits.

These include helping people lose weight without resorting to costly surgery and providing a new use for parks which could help fund their upkeep.

So-called ‘green prescribing’ usually involves doctors ordering patients to undergo some form of physical activity, typically outdoors.

‘Activities could range from intense physical exercise to horticultural work, depending on the needs and abilities of the patient,’ the report says.

Under these proposals, the patient would pay the standard prescription charge, with the NHS topping up the cost of the exercise class and making a donation to the upkeep of the park.

Green prescriptions have also been used to help patients with mental health and dementia problems.

For example, a scheme in Sydenham, in south east London, provides gardening and craft sessions in a local park for people with early-onset dementia.

Today’s report calls on the Department of Health to now pursue the idea by running a series of pilot schemes across the country.

‘Green prescribing offers a considerable opportunity for public health funding to be used to support activities in public green spaces,’ the report says.

‘As additional benefits, such an approach may contribute to the maintenance and improvement of particular spaces, and attract people who have previously used parks either rarely or not at all.’

The call comes in a major report on the future of Britain’s urban parks, which urges ministers to investigate new ways to keep them maintained and safe.

It suggests that local residents could be given council tax discounts in return for volunteering to clean up local parks, allotments and cemeteries.

And it urges ministers to consider allowing residents to hold referendums on whether to impose small local levies to pay for the upkeep of parks in the area.

The report says that funding for parks has been cut by more than 10 per cent in the last three years as council budgets have been squeezed by other priorities.

Other ideas include making it easier for people to donate money for the upkeep of a specific local park, and requiring developers to provide endowments to pay for long-term maintenance of parks in areas of new housing.

Katherine Drayson, author of the report, said: ‘Britain’s parks are the lungs of our great cities. They are an oasis of calm and tranquillity in an increasingly fast moving world. However, as local authority budgets have been squeezed, public funding on parks, cemeteries and allotments has declined sharply.

‘The time has come for radical new thinking to safeguard our parks and make them more accessible to everyone in society. With people’s disposable income still under pressure a ‘green guardian’ scheme that rewards local volunteers to help maintain their local parks with council tax rebates is just one way of protecting and enhancing our public green spaces.’
