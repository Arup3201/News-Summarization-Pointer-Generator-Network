A spurned lover has been handed a two year restraining order after she was convicted of assaulting her partner - by biting his penis during a furious row.

Vicious Sinead Walker, 40, grabbed hold of Vincent Rennoldson’s manhood and tried to 'pull it off' when he angrily ordered her out of his flat.

The drunken mum-of-one who had downed an entire bottle of wine before going round to apologise for a previous bust-up - then sunk her teeth into his private parts.

When Vincent Rennoldson's ex-partner attacked him, he called the police - who heard his screams as his jilted lover tried to bite his penis off

Mr Rennoldson was assaulted by his ex-girlfriend, Sinead Walker, 40 (right). The mother 
of one had drunk an entire bottle of wine before visiting him at his 
flat to apologise for a previous row but she then turned violent

Mr Rennoldson's chilling screams were overheard by an emergency operator after he dialled 999 during the attack.

Recalling the attack, he said:' She was on her knees, got it in her hands and just started biting. I just screamed - the pain was excruciating.'There was a lot of blood and it was painful for weeks afterwards. I now have a three-inch scar on the bottom of my willy.

'It has affected me - I was watching Jaws the other night but had to turn over. If you hit or kick someone that’s one thing - but biting them down there is another thing.

'It could have been worse - she could have bitten it off. At least it still works.'

Rennoldson's former partner has been handed a restraining order

Walker was given a community sentence and handed a restraining order today at Bath Magistrates Court.

Chairman of the bench, Peter Taylor, said: 'Miss Walker this offence is serious enough for a community order.

'This community order will be 12 months and within the order there are two requirements.

'The first will be a 12 month supervision order and the second will be a
curfew for 12 weeks from 7pm until 7am seven days a week.

'We believe compensation should be put to victim referring to bruises and the bitten penis and the on going effects he has.

'You will pay £250 to Mr Rennoldson. You will also pay £100 in court costs.

'The last thing we are going to impose is a two-year restraining order for the purposes of protecting Mr Rennoldson.

'It means you cannot contact him in any way.”

Bath
Magistrates' Court was told that trouble between the pair, who had been
dating for ten months, first flared on December 14 last year.

Jill
MacNamara, prosecuting, said Walker had downed several pints of cider 
before flying into a rage and snarling: 'What’s your f***ing problem?'.

Walker then punched and kicked her partner after he refused to let her leave his flat until police arrived.

Mr Rennoldson could be heard saying 'she’s giving me a kicking' on a frantic 999 call played to the court.

Two
weeks later, on December 28, Walker - on bail accused of the first 
assault - returned to his flat with friends to apologise over drinks.

But the jobless mother, who was drunk, again began directing abuse at her former partner, at around 5pm.

She then lashed out with her fists when he asked her and a friend to get out.

Mr
Rennoldson, choking back the tears, described how she then pulled down 
his boxer shorts and bit his penis while he was on the phone to the 
police.

He told the court: 'She pushed me against the wall in the hallway and pulled my boxer shorts down.

'She grabbed my penis and tried to pull it off. She was on the floor - then she bit it.

'I have now got a scar on it - I will show anybody. She tried to bite my penis off.'

Walker left the flat shortly afterwards, but was later arrested.

Pictures of bruises and scratches to his upper arms, neck and elbow from the attack - as well as the genital injury - were shown to magistrates.

The former shop fitter’s screams - as Walker bit down on him - were also played to the court from his 999 call.

Ms MacNamara said: 'You can hear him 
under attack. That is the best version of events he can give to what 
happened - what he was saying at the time.'

Walker, from Bath, denied two counts of common assault over the December 14 and December 28 attacks.

She claimed she caused some of the injuries to Mr Rennoldson in self-defence, while trying to fight her way out of the flat.

But she insisted she had not bitten his penis.

Erinna Foley-Fisher, defending, said: 'The defendant has done her best to account for his injuries - saying they could have happened during sexual intercourse.'

Gail Bragg, chair of the bench, said: 'We find Mr Rennoldson’s injuries are consistent with the 999 calls and the photographs.

'We do not accept Ms Walker’s claims that it was self-defence.'
