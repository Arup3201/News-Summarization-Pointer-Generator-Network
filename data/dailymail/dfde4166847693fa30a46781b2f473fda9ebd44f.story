Mario Balotelli celebrated scoring the winner against England with a tribute to his favourite player.

Renowned for his peculiar behaviour, the AC Milan and Italy star filled up a sticker album - full of identical pictures of himself.

Balotelli posted the image on his official Facebook page, accompanied with the familiar caption 'WHY ALWAYS ME?'

The former Manchester City frontman normally splashes out on fancy cars with his wage packet, but this time Balotelli has been buying boxes of Panini stickers.

And instead of filling them up with his Italian team-mates, the 23-year-old has replaced them with snaps of himself - 14 of them.

Nobody can say he's not a team player!
