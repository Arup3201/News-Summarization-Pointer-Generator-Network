Businesses lost thousands of pounds over Valentine's weekend after a technical problem meant card transactions could not be processed 

Dozens of businesses lost thousands of pounds over Valentine's Day weekend after a technical problem left them unable to accept card payments.

Problems with chip and pin card transactions started on Friday night and continued throughout Saturday because of issues with the network, run by Global Payments Inc.

Shops, restaurants, cafes and pubs complained about losing business because they could not process card payments throughout Friday evening most of Saturday - one of the busiest weekends of the year. 

The problem was resolved by Saturday evening, with Global Payments posting advice about temporary fixes throughout the day. 

It has now apologised for the issues and said the problem was 'related to a terminal network service provider, and was fully resolved yesterday.'

But dozens of businesses complained about the loss of takings throughout Valentine's Day because card machines were unable to connect to broadband so sales could not be processed. 

Many customers had to be told they would need to pay for meals and gifts in cash.  

Businesses branded the service a 'shambles' and a number have demanded compensation from the organisation. 

Colin Humberstone, a watch seller based in Lincolnshire, posted on Twitter: 'utterly shoddy service, no info, losing thousands! Will be changing provider next week! What a joke!' 

Pettigrew Tearooms, which operates in Cardiff, said they had lost a number of customers because they were unable to accept card payments. They had to take customers' details over the weekend to process the payments later. 

A manager said: 'It was all the walkaways that break your heart.'  

Matthew Fleming owns a bar and claimed the problem meant he had lost tens of thousands of pounds in takings from people enjoying Valentine's Day night's out.

'Stressful. Global Payments UK network now been out of action for 30 hours meaning tens of thousands of merchants can't accept card payments on one of the busiest weekends of the year,' he posted on Facebook, the Mirror reported. 

'We have lost circa £40k so far.'

Cave de Bruno, an independent wine merchant based in East Dulwich in London reported problems throughout the day on Valentine's Day. 

A manager at the store, who did not want to be named, said the problems started on Friday afternoon and were not fixed until Sunday morning. They were forced to take customers' details and spent Sunday inputting them manually. 

He said: 'We are quite lucky here as our business is quite local and we have loyal and trusting customers who were happy to give us their details. We have spent today putting them all through manually.  

Global Payments Inc, one of the country's largest card processing firms, posted advice via its Twitter feed throughout most of Saturday, answering increasingly angry questions from businesses. They advised businesses to try and connect card terminals to land lines, but in some instances this did not work.
