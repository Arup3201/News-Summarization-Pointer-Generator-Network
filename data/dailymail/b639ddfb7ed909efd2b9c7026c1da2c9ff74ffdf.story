Tis the season to be trimmed - in China anyway.

Yesterday the nation celebrated the second lunar month, when it is good luck to get a haircut.

Also known as 'the day the dragon raises its head', it is widely believed you should have your own one refashioned in tribute.

Fresh start: This little boy seems not to care that his haircut is a good luck token to mark the second lunar month

Tradition: Your maternal uncle will die if you cut your hair in February, they say, so the trim is celebratory

The day is referred to as Longitao, which means 'the dragon raises its head' so a haircut honours that move

But the tradition does not seem to have gone down well with this group of children.

Whereas adults and barbers took to the streets with scissors and smiles, their sons and daughters can be seen screaming and crying as they go under the razor.

Some entire families get a number one, much to the infants' distaste.

Others, however, use the day as a chance for a restyled trim, demonstrated by one little tear-soaked boy getting a fresh bowl cut.

Despite the traditions and folklore, these children in Hefei's Leijie Square cannot help but tear up

They join thousands of Chinese people who take to the streets for a trim before parades and markets

It is a large-scale operation, but the tradition is based on a misunderstanding of a fairytale, experts claim

According to folklore academics, the legend was about a man 'thinking of his uncle' who he used to give a haircut to in February. But in Chinese, that sounds very similar to the phrase 'dead uncle'

The distraught toddlers seem unconcerned with the notion that this is a luxury - for if you shave in February, your maternal uncle will die.

According to folklore experts, the superstition stems from a misunderstanding.

In a well-known Chinese legend, a poor barber could not afford a decent new year's gift for his uncle, so he gave him a haircut.

Many children have an entire shave to celebrate, whereas some have some more outlandish styles

Unusually, this little boy grinned amongst his screaming peers as he was given a whole new look

As he seems well aware, the haircut will be followed by dancing, singing and Chinese pancakes

As the fresh rainy season comes for farmers' crops, this is seen as a fresh start for people

This little boy looks frightened and unsure as he leans away from the razor-armed hairdresser

His uncle said it was the best gift he had ever had and wanted to make it a yearly tradition.

After his uncle died, the barber cried every new year thinking of him.

But 'thinking of his uncle' was mistaken for 'death of his uncle' because in Chinese their pronunciations are almost the same.

Reaching the end, this little boy shows off his new fringe as the barber combs the back to finish

Parents are well aware what a hassle this day can be, so are on-hand to make it easier for the hairdresser

Only one of the group in Hefei's Leijie Square, in Anhui province, seemed content as he grinned and stuck his tongue out.

But their tears will have doubtless been dried later with a trip to one of the thousands of parades.

Families also celebrate the day with pancakes and dumplings.
