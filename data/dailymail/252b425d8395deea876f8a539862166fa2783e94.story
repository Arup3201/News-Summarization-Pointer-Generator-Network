The filmmaker and studio behind documentary Bully, have declared victory after winning their battle to have the movie's rating lowered, allowing viewers as young as 13 years old to see it.

Bully - which follows five teenagers and families who have been impacted by bullying - was originally given an R rating for language,  meaning 
anyone under the age of 17 would not be able to see it. 

It became a heated issue between the Motion Picture Association of America and studio The Weinstein Company because the aim of the film is to show young people a closer look at the effects of bullying.

Fly on the wall: The film, follows five teenagers and their families who have been impacted by bullying such as 12-year Alex from Sioux City, Iowa who is relentlessly tormented on a daily basis

Difficulty viewing: In some harrowing scenes, Alex, who says he has difficulties making friends, is attacked on the school bus as well as being pushed and punched in other clips

Should 13 year old's be able to see Harvey Weinstein's harrowing movie Bully?

Director Lee Hirsch said he was able to keep a key scene in the film for which he lobbied hard, but he edited out three uses of one certain word to appease the group that rates movies based on language, sex, violence and other content.

'I'm just glad that we held strong. I think this is a great resolution,' Hirsch told Reuters about his and distributor The Weinstein Co.'s battle with the Motion Picture Association (MPAA) of America's ratings board.

'We are getting so much interest to see the film, and this makes it much easier for schools to get behind it.'

Compromise: Director Lee Hirsch said he was able to keep a key scene in the film for which he lobbied hard, but he edited out three uses of one certain word to appease the group that rates movies based on language, sex, violence and other content

The documentary, opened in New York and Los Angeles last weekend to a strong $23,000 per screen average at box offices, and the new 'PG-13' rating from the MPAA should widen its audience appeal when it expands across the United States on April 13.

Weinstein Co. marketing chief Stephen Bruno said many church groups, school groups and youth organizations had been inquiring about the movie's content, and he hoped that more of them now come to see the film.

The MPAA ranks movies to give audiences an idea of the content within any given film.

Their decision was based on the use of one certain curse word that is used six times in the movie - if it features more than once it automatically results in an 'R'.

But Hirsch had argued that the language was a reflection of real life: 'It's what the children who are victims of bullying face on most days.'

Hirsch and Weinstein initially lobbied the MPAA'S ratings board to change its mind, arguing that it will exclude the very people on whom it would have the most impact - young people.

But Hirsch refused to change his movie, and the MPAA refused to budge, too.

Last weekend, it went out unrated, but even that distinction limits a movie's play in some theaters and to some groups.

A compromise was reached when Hirsch 
agreed to edit out three uses of the particular word, and the MPAA 
agreed to allow one key scene in which one of the film's subjects is 
beaten on a school bus and the word is used three times.

'We
retained the central scene and all three (words) are intact. The whole 
scene is intact and that ... was a great victory for me,' Hirsch said.

The character-driven documentary is 1 hr 34 minutes in duration, and was filmed over the course of the 2009/2010 school year.

Speaking out: The film captures a growing movement among parents and youths to change how bullying is handled

Movement: The film aims to change how bullying is handled in schools, in communities and in society as a whole

It follows a group of teenagers who are being bullied, with some harrowing scenes, such as when 12-year-old Alex from Sioux City, Iowa is taunted and physically assaulted on the school bus.

It also follows the story of a mother who is awaiting the fate of her 14-year-old daughter Ja' Meya, was picked on every day on the school bus, but is now in a juvenile detention centre after she snapped and brandished a loaded handgun.

Two sets of parents are also featured in the film who both lost their children when they committed suicide after being bullied.

The film, which has already opened to critical acclaim, also documents the responses of teachers as well as capturing a growing movement among parents and youths who want to change how bullying is handled.
