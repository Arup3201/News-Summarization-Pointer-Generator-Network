Celtic boss Ronny Deila has declared himself to be ‘calm’ about the contractual situations of his squad ahead of the January transfer window.

Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that new Bolton Wanderers boss Neil Lennon plans to raid his former club for Kris Commons in the New Year.

The midfielder’s deal expires at the end of this season and the 31-year-old has not always been a first-pick under Deila.

But although talks between the player and the club have not yet led to him signing an extension, Deila remains certain that Celtic will hold onto their best player and emerge from the next window stronger than they enter it.

‘We have good control in everything we do. I am calm about that,’ Deila stated. ‘As I said, it is football, you never know what might happen, or what kind of bid will come in for your players.

‘It is too early to say what will happen in January. We are thinking more about what we are going to do and how we are going to make our team stronger. Every window is going to be important if we want consistency and to be always improving.

‘I do not think I need to think too much about that. It is still quite a long time until the window is open so there is going to be rumours every week about who is going here and there. 

'But we want to keep our best players and that is what we will be going for.

‘We want to keep the best players and those who are performing and who we know are going to be important parts of the team and then add them to other players so we can progress. I know the club have the same idea how we are thinking. ‘

Deila takes his side to Dingwall for Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off anxious to close the six-point gap on a Hamilton Accies side who are leading the Premiership after winning at Celtic Park two weeks ago.

And, after injury lay-offs, Deila hopes to welcome back Mikael Lustig, Adam Matthews and Charlie Mulgrew for the game, with James Forrest also an outside bet to return.

‘It’s positive that people are coming back again – Lustig, Adam, Charlie and Forrest who’s near to coming back again so things are looking positive,’ added the Norwegian.

‘They could be in contention for Saturday – three of them and maybe Forrest as well. We’ll see.’
