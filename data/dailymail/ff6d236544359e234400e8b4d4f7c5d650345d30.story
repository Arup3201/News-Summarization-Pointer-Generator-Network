An Australian Muslim woman has spoken out about the trauma she is experiencing as the victim of an international hate campaign led by US white supremacists.

However, the victim Mariam Veiszadeh says strangers showing their support worldwide with a viral hashtag campaign, #IStandWithMairam, continually drive her and help her to stay strong.

The lawyer became the target of cyber bullies in October when she tweeted her disapproval when Woolworths were exposed for selling a singlet with a racist slogan.

A photo of the shirt bearing the Australian flag and the catchphrase 'if you don't love it, leave' was taken at a supermarket in Cairns in far north Queensland. 

'I am outraged that #WOOLWORTHS are allegedly selling these bigoted singlets at their Cairns stores,' she wrote.

When Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured) became the victim of an international hate campaign, people rallied around her by sending messages of support with the hashtag #IStandWithMariam

Ms Veiszadeh was simply one of thousands of people to send a message disapproving on the singlet, pictured on sale at a Cairns supermarket, which read 'If you don't love it, leave' with the Australian flag

Terrifying images, such as the picture above, were photoshopped to make threatening messages to Veiszadeh

It resulted in online backlash against Woolworths and made national headlines.

Ms Veiszadeh joined in with many other Australians to speak out against the supermarket giant for their decision to sell such an offensive item.

'The sentiments that I expressed that day on Twitter were expressed by thousands of other people, but it seemed that people took offence to what I said,' Ms Veiszadeh told Lateline.

The dedicated advocate for the Muslim community received a barrage of disgusting, abusive messages in response. 

'You muslim wh**e. Nobody invited you to Australia. Leave now before we behead your mother and bury you with the pigs,' wrote one vile troll.

'Go back to Afghanistan, you vile sandn***er w***e. 

'Your filthy subhuman kind is not welcome in Australia.' 

Ms Veiszadeh was sent a barrage of abuse, even though many people including Karl Stefanovic spoke out on the topic and thousands made the same comments as the young Australian

Ms Veiszadeh has sworn that when people try to intimidate her it will only steel her resolve and determination

Alarmingly although five months have passed since her original tweet the hateful messages she is receiving is intensifying.

It comes as Ms Veiszadeh has become the target of a hate campaign by US white supremacists.

A US Neo-Nazi website wrote a hate piece about her on February 20, calling for people to 'flood this towel head subhuman vermin with as much racial and religious abuse as we possibly can.'

'Stormer troll army, you know what needs to be done,' they wrote online.

'Be as vulgar, hateful, hurtful, extreme and offensive as possible.'

Images have been photoshopped to show Ms Veiszadeh in disturbing and humiliating situations. 

'They published an incredibly vile article devoting a great deal of attention to me, urging their 5,000 followers to send me as many hateful, religiously motivated offensive tweets as possible,' Ms Veiszadeh told Lateline.

'Their stated objective is to silence me and get me off Twitter.

After launching the Islamophobia Incident Register to help report anti-Muslim behaviour in Australia, the 30-year-old had unfortunately already become accustomed to constantly receiving vile abuse online.

However, nothing could prepare her for what was to come. She is now receiving sickening death threats daily, which she admits is having a detrimental impact on her wellbeing.

'The months of ongoing cyber bullying has definitely taken a personal toll and I'd be lying if I suggested that it hadn't,' she said.

'It has affected my physical and mental health, but in saying that it's also made me more determined than ever to continue to fight against it because their stated objective is to silence me and my stated objective is to do the opposite.'

On March 7, National Women's Day, she used Twitter to write a brave, honest message, sharing her recent struggle and imploring people to seek help to help and change their lives for the better. 

'About a month ago I suffered from prolonged anxiety which manifested itself in several physical illnesses and lasted about six weeks.

'It had a disabling effect on my life... Thanks to the support of family and friends, I managed to overcome it but it has left its scars.

When people became aware of the abuse Ms Veiszadeh was being subjected to, they began to send messages of support using the hashtag #IStandWithMariam, to signify that they are in solidarity with the young woman and her fight against injustice.

Ms Vieszadeh moved to Australia when she was seven years old from Afghanistan. She was born during the Soviet War and granted asylum under the Special Humanitarian Program

'The support has been absolutely overwhelming. The outpouring of support and love that has come my way as a result has been extremely heartwarming.' 

The hashtag was started by her friend Ruth Hazleton but Ms Veiszadeh is receiving messages from all over the world.  

'Keep fighting with class and dignity! #IStandWithMariam. Sending you positive energy from the Phillipines!' wrote Darwin Chiong.

'All the way from U S of A. You go girl #IStandWithMariam,' tweeted Hana Khan.

'London, England is with you Mariam,' wrote Yusuf Akram.

Others praised her for being such an inspiration with her courage and determination to make positive change.

‘You are so brave and an inspiration to all of us who have faced bullying,’ said Ella Simson.

';In awe and inspired that @MariamVeiszadeh will not be silenced by abhorrent racism & misogyny experienced online #IStandWithMariam,' said Serina McDuff.

Ms Veiszadeh promises to continue to work hard to fight for the rights and improve the quality of life of Muslims in Australia, regardless of the abuse she receives. 

She was the driving force between the beautiful yet powerful campaign #WISH, which saw Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and atheists alike taking selfies in hijabs in a bid to shun Islamophobia and show their support for Muslim women.

Channel 10's Jessica Rowe and Nova host Meshel Laurie are amongst thousands of supporters of the Women in Solidarity with Hijabs (WISH) campaign.

She will also work with police to crack down on the cowardly trolls who send hundreds of vile messages online anonymously, assuming there will be no consequences. 

An Ipswich woman has already been charged for allegedly sending strings of abusive online messages in a vicious, ongoing attack against Ms Veiszadeh.

Police are alleging the 22-year-old woman from Collingwood Park used social media to attack the human rights activist who fled Afghanistan when she was a child. 

The attacks allegedly began after the tweet regarding the offending Woolworths shirt. The Ipswich woman is accused of calling Ms Veiszadeh a rag-head, and telling her to return to her 'sand dune country'.

From there the threatening, insulting messages allegedly escalated in frequency and severity. Police have confirmed the woman has been charged with one count of using a carriage service to menace, harrass or cause offence.

As for the offending shirt which started the ordeal, it has been removed from stores.

The Australian retailer responsible claimed that it was  an extremely unfortunate accident and the shirt had never been intended to be sold in their stores.

'It has come to our attention that two Woolworths stores were inadvertantly stocking a singlet that we consider totally unacceptable,' a company spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

'The singlet was not one we ordered. It was delivered to us in error and should never been allowed on our shelves. We will review our processes to ensure this sort of error cannot happen again.'

'As soon as we were made aware we immediately withdrew the product from our shelves.' 

The Woolworths spokesman said the singlet's sentiments did not reflect the company's views.
