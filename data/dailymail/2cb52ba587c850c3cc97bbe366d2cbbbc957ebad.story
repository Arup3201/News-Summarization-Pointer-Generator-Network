Tamoxifen, which costs just 6p a day, reduces the risk of the illness by more than a third and researchers say doctors should give women the pills as freely as statins

Doctors should give women pills to prevent breast cancer as freely as statins, researchers say.

Tamoxifen, which costs just 6p a day, reduces the risk of the illness by more than a third, a major study has found.

Furthermore, the preventative effect lasted for 20 years after a woman stopped taking the pill and was expected still to be working 30 years later or more.

British researchers said if GPs routinely prescribed Tamoxifen to the half a million women at high risk of breast cancer, as many as 3,000 cases a year would be prevented.

The pills are available on the NHS but fewer than 1,000 women are taking them to prevent breast cancer, partly because family doctors are unaware of the benefits.

Around one in eight women will develop breast cancer in Britain and there are 50,000 cases a year. Women are deemed to be high risk if their likelihood of getting the illness is greater than 17 per cent – most often due to a family history of the disease.

A study of 7,154 high-risk women found those given Tamoxifen daily for a five-year period in the 1990s were 38 per cent less likely to have developed breast cancer.

Researchers checking up on the women found that even though some stopped taking the drugs 20 years ago, they were still protected.

And the team expect the effect will still be working in 30 years.

Lead researcher Jack Cuzick, a professor at Queen Mary, the University of London, said that the drugs should be as widely prescribed as statins are to protect against heart disease.

‘There’s a major cultural shift which the profession needs to embrace,’ he said.

‘There’s a fatalism about cancer, there’s a feeling there’s nothing you can do about it very much. We have very clear evidence we can do something.

‘What’s new and exciting about this is that even though Tamoxifen was stopped after five years, benefits continued unabated after 20 years.’

He said many women were unaware they were at high risk.

To address this, he said, they should take risk assessments – a short questionnaire – at the time of their first mammogram, aged 47 to 50.

Professor Cuzick presented his study at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium conference in Texas, and it is also published in the Lancet Oncology medical journal.

Surprisingly, while it showed that Tamoxifen prevented the cancer occurring, the pill did not appear to reduce the total risk of dying from the illness.

Professor Cuzick believes that it is still too early for this to be apparent. The study is still running, and he suspects that in a few years it will be clear that Tamoxifen also prevents deaths from cancer.

Last year the NHS rationing body NICE recommended that GPs prescribe Tamoxifen to women at high risk. But bizarrely it has not been licensed as safe by another watchdog – the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency – so many doctors are unwilling.

The drug works by blocking the hormone oestrogen from reaching potentially cancerous cells, which can cause them to divide. But it has unpleasant side effects, including many menopause-like symptoms such as hot flushes, sweats, nausea, muscle ache and weight gain.

There is also a small risk of endometrial cancer, a rare form of cancer in the womb lining.

Professor Anthony Howell, a cancer specialist at the University of Manchester, said: ‘Identifying all high-risk women and offering them Tamoxifen could potentially prevent up to 3,000 cases of breast cancer a year.

‘A large proportion do not know they are at increased risk.If these women were to take Tamoxifen, it could prevent thousands getting breast cancer in the first place.’
