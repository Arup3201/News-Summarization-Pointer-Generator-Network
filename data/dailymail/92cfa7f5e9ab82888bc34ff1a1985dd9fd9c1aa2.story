Victoria Beckham may have turned forty this year but with her glowing, wrinkle-free skin, but looks younger than ever, despite managing a hectic work schedule and raising four children.

Gracing the cover of Vogue's August edition, the mother-of-four showcased an enviable complexion - but what's her secret?

The prolific tweeter, who seemingly hasn't aged a day since she burst onto the scene with the Spice Girls in the noughties, has shared two of her secret weapons via the social medium.

What's your secret, Victoria? Mrs Beckham, who has an enviably smooth complexion, has reveled a few of her favourite products

Victoria, 40, is a huge fan of Lancer Lift Serum Intense, which is described as 'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up cellular regeneration'.

The luxury serum claims to boost the creation of collagen and new skin cells, as well as protect new cells from environmental aggravators.

It is also packed with electromagnetically-neutral gold and moisture-holding molecules to support the skin's natural cycle for younger, firmer and smoother skin.

But what on earth is electromagnetically-neutral gold? Well, healthy skin has a well-balanced electrical charge that optimises cell function, allowing for efficient renewal and rejuvenation.

Skincare secrets: Victoria, 40, is a huge fan of the £230 Lancer Lift Serum Intense, which is described as 'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up cellular regeneration', left, but also loves the more purse-friendly £30 This Works In Transit Camera Close-Up primer, right

When this 
electrical charge is disrupted by environmental aggressors like UV 
radiation or free radical activity, cells no longer function at their 
full potential, which can result in a dull, uneven complexion and a loss
 of elasticity and radiance.

The 
electromagnetically-neutral gold ingredient in this product promises to 
help stabilise and maintain the skin’s natural electromagnetic field to 
promote healthy, radiant skin and also absorbs free radicals before they
 can induce inflammation.

However, 
Victoria's favourite serum doesn't come cheap. The 25ml serum will set 
you back £230 - only the best for Mrs Beckham, right?

Despite her love of all things luxury, the fashion designer is also a huge fan of a much cheaper product, which she uses to prime her skin.

Victoria tweeted her love of the £30 This Works In Transit Camera Close Up, a mask, moisturiser and primer in one that claims to be be
the perfect multi-tasking product 'to have on you at all times to make 
sure you are ready for the camera in an instant'.

The product claims to 'balance, plump 
and brighten skin tone, getting you ready for the camera in an 
instant' - perfect for the showbiz stalwart then.

If
 her recent tweets are anything to go by, the former Spice Girl has 
upped her health regime since hitting her landmark birthday.

Superfood fan: Since turning 40, Victoria has 
been tweeting about her love of superfoods including acai, left, and bee
 panacea, right, which is known as one of the most nutritious superfoods
 ever

Victoria has tweeted her love for a host of superfoods, the most recent being acai berry - renowned for aiding weight loss.

She also tweeted about bee panacea, which combines all the components of bee products, including raw 
honey, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly. It is also packed with algae, 
herbs, botanicals and probiotics, making it one of the most nutritious 
and effective superfoods available.

It comes as no surprise that Victoria has been focussing on boosting her health regime - the busy fashion designer has just unveiled a sneak peek of her AW14 Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection - and it's full of embellished minis, crisp polka-dot shirts and soft cashmere jumpers.
