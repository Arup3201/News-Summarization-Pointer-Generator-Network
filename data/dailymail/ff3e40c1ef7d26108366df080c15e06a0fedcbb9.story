Papiss Cisse has accepted a Football Association charge of violent conduct following his elbow on Everton’s Seamus Coleman.

The Newcastle striker will now await confirmation of a three-game ban from the FA.

Cisse lashed out at Coleman during Newcastle's 3-2 victory over Everton on Sunday.

The Newcastle striker had been charged by the FA on Monday following Sunday's incident at St James' Park

Cisse could now miss up to seven Newcastle games through suspension and international duty

Cisse is the sharpest striker in the Premier League this season, with his nine goals coming from just 633 minutes of playing time. That’s a goal every 70.3 minutes.

He later scored his ninth of the season to make it 1-1 and Everton boss Roberto Martinez fumed that Cisse should not have been on the pitch.

A Newcastle statement read: 'Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has accepted a charge of violent conduct from the Football Association.

'Cisse was involved in an incident involving Everton's Seamus Coleman during the Barclays Premier League fixture at St James' Park on Sunday December 28.

'Cisse has accepted the charge and will now serve a three-match suspension, which starts with immediate effect.'

The striker is now likely to miss Newcastle’s next seven fixtures – three because of suspension and four because of his involvement with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Those games include the New Year’s Day visit of Burnley, the FA Cup tie at Leicester, a trip to Chelsea, home match with Southampton, away at Hull, at home to Stoke and possibly a visit to Crystal Palace.

Cisse was charged with violent conduct by the FA on Monday after Sky Sports cameras picked up the striker swinging his elbow in to Coleman's face on three occasions, connecting at least once. 

He is due to fly out to Equatorial Guinea with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations next month.

Burnley (H), Jan 1 - Premier League

Leicester (A), Jan 3 - FA Cup

Chelsea (A), Jan 10 - Premier League

Southampton (H), Jan 17 - Premier League

Hull (A), Jan 31 - Premier League

Stoke (H), Feb 8 - Premier League

Crystal Palace (A), Feb 11 - Premier League

AFCON runs from January 17 until February 8, meaning Cisse will miss Newcastle's home fixture against Southampton on January 17 and their trip to Hull on January 31.

Should much-fancied Senegal progress to the latter stages then Cisse will also miss the St James' Park clash against Stoke on February 8 and probably the trip to Crystal Palace on February 11.

With the club set to lose manager Alan Pardew to Palace, Cisse's unavailability is a blow they cannot afford.

The forward scored his ninth of the season in the 3-2 win over Everton on Sunday but his elbow on Coleman looks like it will have more significance than that strike come the end of the season.
