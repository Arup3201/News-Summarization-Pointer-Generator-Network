Speaking out: Leading fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston

Ed Miliband's plans for a mansion tax are like something out of ‘Soviet Russia’, one of the party’s own peers declared last night.

Leading fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston said the policy was unfair because it would not affect people in similar-sized properties in other cities in the UK.

The IVF pioneer warned the plan, which levies an annual tax worth thousands of pounds on homes worth more than £2million, could result in homeowners being forced to move out – a prospect he compared to the Marxism inflicted on Russia after the revolution.

Asked about the tax in a radio interview, the 74-year-old said he joined the Labour Party ‘because I believed Labour was after fairness’.

Lord Winston, who also found fame for presenting BBC documentaries such as Child of Our Time and the Human Body series and lives in a terraced property in Hampstead Garden Suburb, one of the most affluent parts of London, added: ‘My terraced house in London is probably just close to that band. 

If I had the same identical house on the outskirts of Birmingham, it would be half that amount and I would never pay this kind of tax. That doesn’t seem right to me.’

Asked if he could just move somewhere smaller to avoid the tax, he replied: ‘If you’ve lived in a house for 30 or 40 years I’m not sure government should be forcing you to move out. That then becomes something that last really happened in the Soviet Union after the revolution.’

The Labour policy has already been criticised by several of the party’s own leading candidates to be Mayor of London, including Diane Abbott, Dame Tessa Jowell and Margaret Hodge, while last week Lord Mandelson said it was ‘crude’.

The party has said homes worth between £2million and £3million will pay £3,000 a year, but shadow chancellor Ed Balls refused to give details on the levy which would be paid on properties over £3million.

A Labour spokesman said the tax ‘would apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the UK’s homes’, adding: ‘When working people have seen their wages fall by £1,600 a year since 2010 it is right to ask those who have the most to make a bigger contribution.’
