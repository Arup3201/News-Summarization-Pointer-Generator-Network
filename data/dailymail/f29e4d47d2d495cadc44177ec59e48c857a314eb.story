Simon Cowell once ordered Cheryl Cole to get rid of her ‘crazy hair’ – but it seems that the majority of women disagree.

The singer’s wavy brunette hair is the most copied celebrity hairstyle in the UK, according to a study.The second most requested style is This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby’s sleek honey-coloured locks, according to hairdressers Toni & Guy.

Model Kelly Brook’s loosely curled hairdo came third in the poll of 2,000 women, while fourth place went to the Duchess of Cambridge’s glossy blow-dried curls. 

Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, whose famous ‘Rachel cut’ inspired millions of women, was fifth with her current layered cut.

Luscious locks: Cheryl Cole's long, brunette style is the most copied in the UK while women also wanted her look when she dyed her hair red, right

Sacha Mascolo-Tarbuck, of Toni & 
Guy, said: ‘Cheryl’s long brunette hair has been popular for some time 
now. You can wear it in curls one day, straight the next and in a smart 
up-do for a night out. Perhaps that’s why they are so popular with 
women.’

Cole, who models for L’Oreal hair 
products, features twice in the list, with her short-lived dyed-red 
hairstyle coming in sixth place.

But the pop star’s hair has attracted more than its fair share of controversy in the past.

She was accused of misleading fans by
taking part in a national advertising campaign for L’Oreal Elvive Full 
Restore 5 shampoo and conditioner, showing off impossibly shiny hair – 
which turned out to be the result of £1,000 hair extensions.

In 2009 the Advertising Standards 
Authority said it received 13 complaints that the adverts were 
misleading, but rejected them because the disclaimer about Miss Cole’s 
hair extensions was ‘clear and legible’ on the commercial.

Equally controversial was the 
dramatic, back-combed hairstyle that Cole sported for the launch of her 
ill-fated career as a judge on American X Factor in 2011.

According to Miss Cole, Cowell, who 
fired her just two weeks into the show amid ‘concerns over her image’, 
told her after the first day of filming: ‘The crazy hair goes tomorrow.’
The survey also found that a third of women have asked their hairdresser
to recreate the same cut or colour as their favourite celebrity.

Mascolo-Tarbuck added: 'The hair styles featured at the top of the list are very versatile and can be made to look different fairly easily.

'We see millions of women each year requesting hair similar to celebrities, from Cheryl, Holly and Kelly’s classic looks right through to Rihanna’s or Rita Ora’s more daring styles.

'It will be interesting to see who the next big celebrity inspiration will be.'

Hair idols: The Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Jennifer Aniston were also in the top ten

Fourth in the poll of 2,000 women was mother-to-be Kate Middleton whose brunette, slightly wavy hair has been coveted ever since her 2011 wedding to Prince William thrust her into the spotlight.

Meanwhile former Friends actress Jennifer Aniston’s long layered hair still remains an inspiration for millions of women years after her famous 'Rachel cut', as she was voted fifth place.

Cheryl Cole’s brief change from her signature hairstyle - mahogany-coloured waves - is at number six, followed by Cameron Diaz’s short, choppy look.

TV’s New Girl star Zooey Deschanel came eighth in the poll thanks to her heavy fringe and while Kim Kardashian’s dark, glossy hair is at nine.

Anne Hathaway’s short pixie crop, which she cut as part of her role in Oscar winning film Les Miserables, completed the top ten.

Other celebrities to feature in the list include The Saturday’s singer Frankie Sandford with her asymmetrical pixie crop and Jessie J’s sharp bob.

Supermodel Cara Delavigne’s long blonde locks, Gwen Stefani’s platinum hue and Harry Potter’s Emma Watson and her pixie cut are also among the most common hairstyles requested by women.

Researchers also revealed that a third of women have walked into a hairdressers and asked to be given the exact same cut or colour as their favourite celebrity.

And almost four in ten regularly use pictures of a star’s hairstyle for inspiration when they are looking for a new look.

Fifteen per cent even admitted they would change their hair colour or style if their favourite celebrity did.

But another 15 per cent said they had changed their hair cut or colour to look less like a celebrity while 17 per cent have regretted copying the style of someone famous.
