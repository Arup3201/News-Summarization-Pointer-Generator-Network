A sudden gust of wind blew Pope Francis’s white skull cap – or zucchetto – from his head yesterday as he left St Peter’s Square in Rome after a ceremony in which he confirmed 44 children from around the world.

A crowd of 70,000 watched the event, part of the Year of Faith celebrations,during which Francis asked for prayers for victims of the Bangladesh factory collapse.

It is not the first time a gust of wind 
has blown the white skull cap off a pope's head as Pope Benedict XVI 
suffered the same fate seven years ago.

Pope Benedict lost his cap as he crossed Bells Arch in the Vatican City for the general Audience at St. Peter's Square in May 2006.

On that occasion the zucchetto was caught by one of the Pope's aides.

Among those being confirmed by Pope Francis today included Emily Mulcahy and Edmond Roche, of Cork, in Ireland.

The day was described as ‘unbelievable’ by Emily’s father Paul, who saw his daughter blessed by the new Pontiff.

He said: ‘It was unbelievable. It’s very difficult to put something like this into words. I was very emotional at times.

'It was just very overwhelming. There were thousands of people at it. It was like when they announced the Pope was elected. It was absolutely incredible. When Pope Francis began to speak, you could hear a pin drop.’

Mr Mulcahy said he believes the Confirmation hasn’t sunk in with his daughter. He remarked: ‘It’s been such a roller coaster ride. We’re just walking on a high. She went up and was confirmed.

He blessed her and she walked back down. He met her with the other children before it and he shook her hand and said hello.’

Emily chose the Confirmation name Bridget, while Edmond, appropriately enough, went for Francis.

The students – who are both altar servers – were chosen during draws in their parishes.

The diocese of Cloyne was invited by the Vatican to choose a boy and a girl to take part in the unique ceremony, just six weeks into the new Pope’s pontificate.
