From a kick-about in the local park to teaming up in a vital international years later is fanciful material usually reserved solely for the dreams of Scottish youngsters. Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld are on the brink of pulling off the feat within six months.

It was only back in April that Robertson and Gauld posed for a team picture with their then Tannadice buddies John Souttar and Joe McGovern at Magdalene Green in Dundee after a jumpers-for-goalposts session.

The former Tayside flatmates will be reunited on Monday, with the Scotland squad’s plush Mar Hall training base their home for the week.

Then, on Saturday, Robertson and Gauld could link up for the first time since going their separate, lucrative ways in the summer. Ibrox will be the stage when Gordon Strachan’s side goes out to secure a European Championship qualifying victory against Georgia.

Around £6million changed hands for the pair during the close season. Robertson, 20, has starred for Hull City in the Barclays Premier League, while Gauld is being brought along steadily with Sporting Lisbon’s B squad since leaving Dundee United.

The 18-year-old’s tentative start to life in Portugal didn’t stop Strachan rewarding him with a first senior call-up last Tuesday. The news came as a welcome surprise to Robertson, who can’t wait to make a dream come true.

‘It would be brilliant to be out there playing in the same Scotland team as Ryan,’ said Robertson. ‘We shared a flat together and were close at Dundee United. We’ve been away from each other and I would love to see him make his debut and earn a cap.

‘Everyone loves playing for their country and we’ve done it at the age levels. Hopefully there’s much more to come from both of us playing in the senior team.

‘It came as a surprise to see him named. I don’t know if he knew or not and was just keeping it from me. But I’m delighted for him.

‘It’s brilliant he’s taken a big step in moving to another country, learning a new language — I’m sure he’s looking forward to speaking to us Scots again!

‘He thoroughly deserves the call-up. I am sure he’ll make a great impression and put his stamp on the training ground work that we do with the manager.’

Gauld’s promotion arrives only a month after he scored his first Under-21 goals, against Luxembourg, the type of fast-track route with which Robertson is familiar. He took all of two months at Dundee United to earn a call-up from Billy Stark last October and, by early March, he made his debut for the senior team in a friendly victory in Poland.

That doesn’t indicate the Scotland manager is acting in haste, however. Robertson was, on occasion, borrowed for use in training games last season by Strachan and, as he explains, the national boss is fond of using time off the coaching field to create a personal connection while a new young recruit is assessed among the establishment.

‘The most important thing is on the training ground,’ said Strachan, whose other uncapped call-up is Sheffield Wednesday’s Stevie May. ‘Can they play with good players or do good players intimidate them? Do they buy into what we are doing? Is their style of play all right for it? 

'And then, it’s really about them. Have they got a brother, a sister? Where are your mum and dad from? Just basic chat to get to know them better, before they come in cold.

‘I don’t know too much about Ryan. I have seen him play but I don’t know him as a kid. I’ve never sat down with him, never had him in a training session. If you look at my squads, I like to have younger ones now and then. Come on then, let’s have a look at you, get together so, in the future, it’s no big shock.’

That was an approach which sat well with Robertson when he found himself propelled into the international arena a week before his 20th birthday and eight months after leaving amateur football behind at Queen’s Park.

‘If the manager decides it’s time for Ryan, one of the best prospects in Scotland — if not the best — to come into the group and get started, then the timing must be right,’ said Robertson. ‘I think he’ll deal with it and show what he can do on the pitch and in training.

‘When I got called in for the Poland game, it was quite daunting. I didn’t know anyone at that time. Ever since I set foot in the hotel, the manager spoke to me quite a lot to see how I was doing. I talked to him and (Scotland assistant manager) Mark McGhee in one-on-ones. 

'He obviously gains quite a lot from having those conversations and getting to know you a bit better on a personal level, what you are like off the pitch.

‘I guess he will do the same with Ryan. Also, in team meetings, he gets it across so very well. Everyone in the squad knows what he expects both as an individual and from the team.

‘I was lucky enough to make my debut in Poland and, hopefully, I repaid that trust on the pitch.’

A start against Nigeria in May followed that substitute appearance in Warsaw and, as a quickly established member of Steve Bruce’s top-flight line-up, was all set to continue his rise through the ranks with a competitive Scotland debut against Germany last month.

Gauld joined Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon from Dundee United in 2014 for a reported £3million

Agonisingly, a calf tear 10 minutes from the end of his club’s game at Aston Villa put paid to his participation against the World Cup winners. Robertson dutifully turned up for Scotland service in the vain hope of finding a way to make the plane but a scan confirmed all the fears that he would require a 10-day rest.

That injury strain was then put to the test by solo celebrations at his new Hull home when Ikechi Anya’s brilliant finish past Manuel Neuer gave Scotland hope of pinching an opening-night point from the section’s most difficult fixture.

‘It almost made it harder being around the squad because I could feel the buzz and everyone was looking forward to the game,’ said Robertson. ‘I was desperate to get out there and get involved ahead of such a big game. It was unfortunate I couldn’t.

‘The only positive was that I wasn’t out too long and was able to get back for the next Hull league game. I caught the tear early and didn’t make it worse.

‘I was in Hull and watched it by myself in the house, cheering on the boys. I wished I was back in Scotland to see it in a local pub or something and see all the reactions. I was OK, I was out the squad and there was nothing I could do about it. But it was harder watching and knowing I could have been involved. I thought the boys did brilliantly.

Robertson hopes to make the Germany match but a scan confirmed that he would require a 10-day rest

‘I thought “Kech” scored an amazing goal because you saw him running through and, having all that time to think about being one-on-one with perhaps the best goalkeeper in the world, then he kept his composure. It was unfortunate we couldn’t hold on to a point. Maybe it just shows in the end when it’s world-class players like Thomas Muller you’re up against and he scores two goals.’

Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Edin Dzeko were among the World Cup stars Robertson was confronted by last weekend against Manchester City when, after an encouraging start to the season, Hull met with their second defeat of the campaign.

The Scot has certainly not looked out of his depth, though, as he adjusts to the step up in class — his trademark raids up the left flank and unerring deliveries into the penalty box have transferred themselves to his new environment and even provided the opener in Saturday’s 2-0 defeat of Crystal Palace. He will bring solid English top-flight form to the left-back position for Scotland’s matches against Georgia then Poland.

‘I have not put in a complete performance yet,’ he continued. ‘Hopefully I can do that soon but so far I’m pleased. It’s a great league to play in and I’ve enjoyed every game. But I know I can show a lot more.

‘The manager has been brilliant with me, helped me through a lot already and tweaked things in my game. I know I’m still young, so that’s what has to happen.

‘I’d say the tempo would be the biggest difference and it’s much more physical. So I need to work on my fitness, be a lot quicker. I’m learning a lot with better players around me.

‘I’m trying in the gym to build up and get stronger but I don’t want to do too much too soon. It’s a gradual improvement we’re looking for and I’ll just keep on doing my program and, hopefully, see the results.’
