The military mothers who posed for photographs while breastfeeding in their uniform were out of line, the Washington Air National Guard said on Saturday.

Terran Echegoyen-McCabe and Christina Luna are pictured nursing their babies on an Air Force base in an image that they said was intended to raise awareness of the right to breastfeed in public.

But the controversial photoshoot was a violation of regulations against using the uniform to promote a civilian cause, according to Guard spokesman Capt. Keith Kosik.

He told the New York Daily News the pair were not expected to
face disciplinary action but that the incident warranted a formal 
response for educational purposes.

The striking image has seen a flurry 
of comments, from supporters who say breastfeeding is a 'fundamental 
right' to another who compared it to 'defecating in uniform'.

The photos were taken for the Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support Group, set up by a military wife and mother-of-three to raise awareness of all women's rights to breastfeed in public.

Mrs Echegoyen-McCabe is pictured 
breastfeeding her 10-month-old twin girls on her lunch break during a drill weekend as a member of the Air National Guard. By her side is friend Mrs Luna who feeds her toddler.

Crystal Scott, founder of Mom2Mom, asked the women to pose for the support group she founded in January to help those who live and work at the Fairchild  Air Force Base outside Spokane, Washington.

Mrs Scott has lived on the base for four years with her husband Kevin, an instructor, and their three children Gavin, ten, Aiden, four and one-year-old Roman.

It was her idea to asked photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir to photograph the mothers in their fatigues ahead of National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August.

Following the photoshoot two weeks ago, the image of the military mothers breastfeeding was posted online and became a red-hot issue.

Mrs Scott told MailOnline: 'We were not expecting it. We went to bed and the next morning, we were getting calls, comments and emails.

Although there has been a rally of 
support, one Facebook comment compared the image of the mothers in 
uniform to 'urinating and defecating'.

Mrs Scott said: 'No one can agree on everything and everyone is 100 per cent entitled to their opinion.

'But to compare breastfeeding to other bodily functions like defecating and urinating? It's disheartening and saddening.'

She added: 'We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud.

'We can only hope that it brings positive changes not only for military but for women across the board to show them they don't have to hide in the closet.'

'We love our military. We don't want to go against them at all.'

There are currently no clear regulations as to whether or not a military member in uniform is allowed to breastfeed.

We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud.

There has been much confusion over this issue with some servicewomen being asked to move to private rooms while at the same time nothing has been said to women feeding their babies from bottles.

The Mom2Mom Facebook page has been flooded with comments.

Tracy Mueller Schoesler wrote: 'What strong beautiful women who are not just fighting for the freedoms of this country but for themselves and their children! Breastfeeding is a fundamental right in or out of an uniform!'

One supporter Anna Krause commented: 'This is great. You are still A mom no matter what.'

Another Jessica Emerick said: 'I 
can't believe someone would have the audacity to judge or criticize this
photo, or any nursing mother. It's pitiful.'

However there have been detractors. One fellow
soldier Rita Trujillo commented: 'I as one of many women who fought 
long and hard to be accepted and respected as fellow soldiers and the 
right to wear these uniforms feel shocked, angry at these published 
photos.'

Bringing about change: Trysta Chavez also posed for a photograph with her baby after seeing a lack of support for women breastfeeding in public

Statement: Mrs Chavez was among the women who allowed themselves to be photographed for a campaign for National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August

Robyn Roche-Paull, a lactation consultant and a U.S. Navy Veteran wrote a book and has a blog called Breastfeeding in Combat Boots which aims to make women's position clearer while breastfeeding and serving their country. 

As she writes: 'There are NO polices or regulations in any of the military branches that either approve OR disapprove of breastfeeding in uniform.'

She said that arguments against were based on the fact that it shows a woman to be nurturing and therefore 'unprofessional'.

U.S. law states that a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a Federal building or on Federal property.
