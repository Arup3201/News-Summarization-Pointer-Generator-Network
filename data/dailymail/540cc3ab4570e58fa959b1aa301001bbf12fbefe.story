The scene, the date and, most significantly, the words remain crystal clear. It is July 2012 and at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground a film crew is working on a fly-on-the-wall documentary.

Joe Allen, who is on the brink of completing a £15million move to Anfield, is warmly greeted by Brendan Rodgers, given they had worked together at Swansea.Liverpool’s new manager turns to the camera and delivers a standout line. ‘This is the Welsh Xavi,’ Rodgers proclaims.

As far as build-ups go, this one could not have been any bigger. A comparison with one of the greatest Spanish footballers in history guaranteed that rather than being able to slip quietly into his new surroundings, as he may have wanted, the spotlight was instantly shining on Allen.

There have been times in the subsequent two years when that comment, coupled with the price tag, looked to weigh heavily on his slender shoulders. Though he began brightly, Allen’s form tailed off in his first campaign and, during last season’s charge for the title, he only made 15 starts.

Given that Rodgers has spent much of this summer recruiting a plethora of new midfield options, it would seem Allen is facing a fight to live up to that exalted billing but, to stand next to him, you can see he has prepared himself extensively for the battle that lies ahead.

When he first walked through the doors, he was elfin in stature but now, thanks to a extensive hours in the gym and the advice of Liverpool’s conditioning team, Allen is sporting a considerably more muscular frame and his shoulders are significantly bulkier to carry that expectation.

‘It has been a process over the last season, really,’ says Allen. ‘I have been much more focused in that department. When you have a few injuries, you get more into a routine in the gym but it was something that I needed to do.

‘I can definitely feel the benefits of it and I think there is a bit more to do. It is about getting those marginal gains . . . you have to realise how much of a difference it can make.’ Clearly he is ready for the fight. Allen is never happier than when he is at his rural home with his young family, but, equally, the responsibility of thriving for Liverpool is not something he will ever shirk.   

‘For some people the Xavi comparison could probably be an albatross,’ he adds. ‘But, then again, he is some player to be compared to. If I’m honest, I don’t take things like that too serious even if some people have maybe used that in a negative way.’

Top boyo! Brendan Rodgers brought Joe Allen for £15m after working with him at Swansea

Rodgers remains a huge admirer of his talents but the Wales international knows it is crucial over the coming 12 months to establish himself.

The talent is certainly there. His passing accuracy percentage for last season was 89.68 and, with Liverpool having the Champions League added to their workload, he will have a role to play as Rodgers looks to consistently find a winning blend while preserving freshness.

How, though, will he become one of the main men? Adam Lallana’s untimely injury might offer him a chance to profit and, in the early hours of Monday morning, when Liverpool face Olympiakos here in the Guinness International Champions Cup, Allen will be ready. ‘It is a big year personally, of course, but every year is at a club like this,’ he explains.

‘We have lost a world class player, in Luis Suarez . . . but the club are reinvesting and we have brought in some really quality players. This season we go again. We can dream of going one step further.’
