The great ones leave the deepest memories; we recall John McEnroe unfolding a cross-court backhand or Brian Lara persuading a languid late cut between slip and gully, each stroke a small miracle of timing and imagination.

At their best, they seemed to be playing a different game from the rest.

Then, quite suddenly, the magic dissolved and they became human once again. As he approaches his 39th birthday, Tiger Woods may be undergoing that same, sombre transformation.

Tiger Woods has struggled desperately for form over the past couple of years as he combats injuries

Woods was sick and is in last place heading into the final round of his comeback tournament 

His summer form was woeful, having returned too soon from back surgery.

He missed the cut five times in eight tournaments, and retreated to rehabilitation in August. But the start of his comeback in Isleworth, Florida, on Thursday was an extended nightmare.

It started with a tee shot hooked into a neighbouring swimming pool, featured a smattering of stubbed chips, and ended 77 shots later.

He was furious, of course, and seethingly frustrated to have finished the opening day in last place, four shots behind the field.

But that is his form, and his only answer is to work harder, concentrate more fiercely and pray that the game which once came so naturally will cease to resemble an impenetrable mystery. 

As for the rest of us, it does no harm to remember just how stunning his golf used to be, and the cavalier fashion in which his victories were achieved. For a time - indeed, for a long time - he appeared almost invincible.

The statistics tell their own tale: four Masters, four US PGAs, three US Opens and three Open Championships for a total of 14 majors. At his dazzling peak, he was quite untouchable. But the game, just like every game, has a way of taking its revenge, and now he struggles like a mortal where once he strutted like a god.

Yet here’s the strangest thing: in his travails, Tiger Woods seems more sympathetic, more human, somehow more admirable than ever he did when the living was easy, and glory followed him down every fairway.
