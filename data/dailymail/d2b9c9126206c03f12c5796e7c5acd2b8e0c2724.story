If you think golf balls don't strike twice, you'd be wrong... as a Tiger Woods fan found out in rather painful fashion yesterday.

The German tourist was enjoying the final round of the World Golf Championships in Doral, Florida, when the golfing legend's opening tee shot landed squarely on his head, spurting blood over his white polo shirt.

An apologetic Woods came over to the man, who had travelled thousands of mile to see his hero play, and autographed a glove hoping it would seal the end of his bad luck.

Ouch! The German tourist was enjoying the final round of the World Golf Championships at the Trump National in Doral, Florida, when the golfing legend's opening tee shot landed squarely on his head

Bloody: The man, who did not want to give his name, was forced to stem the bleeding with a hanky

Funny side: But he managed to see the funny side after Woods came over to apologise

'And I get this souvenir,' he said, almost smiling as he held up the ball.

'Sorry about that,' woods replied before handing him the signed glove.

But minutes later the exact same thing happened again, forcing Woods to hand over a second signed glove with an accompanying apology.

With glove: Woods then autographed a glove hoping it would seal the end of his bad luck

Not his day: Minutes later the exact same thing happened again, forcing Woods to hand over a second signed glove and its accompanying apology

Back in the buggy: Later, Woods and his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn were pictured as they returned to his famous luxury yacht, Privacy, where they were staying

Lap of luxury: They stayed on the boat which was docked in Miami Beach for about a week as he usually has for the past few years when he comes to play in the annual Cadillac Championship tournament in Miami

The next question, then, wasn't could he catch eventual winner Patrick Reed, but did he have enough golf gloves in his bag?

He ended the day with a six-over par 78, beating only two of the field's 68 players.
