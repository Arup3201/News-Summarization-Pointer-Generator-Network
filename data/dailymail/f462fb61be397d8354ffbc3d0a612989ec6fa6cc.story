David Cameron issued a coded warning yesterday that Britain is prepared to sue Spain over its treatment of Gibraltar.

As a day of telephone diplomacy descended into name calling, the Prime Minister called Spanish leader Mariano Rajoy to warn him that Spain must back down or the UK ‘will be forced to do more’ to defend the people of the Rock.

Officials admitted this could go as far as legal action in the European Court of Justice.

Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron made clear his unhappiness to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy, warning controls at the border with Gibraltar were 'disproportionate and unacceptable'

After the call, Mr Cameron vowed: ‘Britain will always stand up for the people of Gibraltar.’

But hopes he had won concessions from Mr Rajoy were dashed as officials continued to impose draconian border controls.

Last night Foreign Secretary William 
Hague was harangued in a phone call with his Spanish counterpart, Jose 
Garcia-Margallo, who has threatened to impose tolls at the border and 
ban Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spain’s airspace.

Spain imposed border controls at the 
weekend after the government of Gibraltar sank concrete blocks in the 
waters off the Rock to deter Spanish fishermen.

But the skipper of one of the Spanish
 fishing boats involved said yesterday that he was being ‘used’ by his 
government for political purposes.

Mr Cameron warned that UK-Spanish relations could be damaged ‘unless the situation at the border improved’.

This week Gibraltar's chief minister asked Britain to send Royal Navy warships to the area in a bid to stop Spanish boat police making unauthorised incursions into the Rock's territorial waters.

Fabian Picardo accused Madrid of 'sabre-rattling' and behaving like North Korea after Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo's suggested introducing a levy on people crossing the border between Gibraltar and Spain.

Mr Cameron decided to intervene in the row after returning to London on Monday after a holiday in Portugal.

He called Mr Rajoy to ‘raise serious concerns about actions by the Spanish at the border with Gibraltar’.

At the start of the conversation Mr Cameron made clear that his deep unhappiness at suggestions by Mt Garcia-Margallo that they may introduce further measures.

Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘Constructive call with Spain's PM Rajoy. I made clear my concerns re Gibraltar and that our position on sovereignty won't change.’

A Downing Street spokesman added: ‘The
 PM made clear that our position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar and its
 surrounding waters will not change.

‘He
 also reiterated, as the PM and Mr Rajoy had previously agreed, that the
 issue should not damage our bilateral relations. However, there was a 
real risk of this happening unless the situation at the border improved.

‘Mr
 Rajoy agreed that he did not want the issue to become an obstacle in 
the bilateral relations and that we needed to find a way to de-escalate 
the issue. As a next step, the Foreign Secretary should speak to Mr 
Garcia-Margallo to discuss a way forward.

‘In
 the meantime, Prime Minister Rajoy committed to reducing measures at 
the border. Both leaders agreed that there should be a solution to the 
fishing dispute.’

Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo urged the UK government to 
'demonstrate the waters are British by filling them with British assets'

The latest row began after Mr Picardo ordered the dumping of 70 concrete blocks into a small bay around the Gibraltar airport runway in order to prevent Spanish overfishing of the area.

Spain hit back by introducing time-consuming security checks at the border post leading to huge queues and long delays for people travelling from Gibraltar into Spain.

Britain's ambassador to Spain made a formal protest over ‘disproportionate’ checks at the border.

In his meeting with Spanish foreign secretary Gonzalo de Benito, ambassador Giles Paxman also sought an official explanation for Spanish threats to levy a charge on vehicles crossing the border and to close airspace.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Giles Paxman visited the Spanish secretary of state (for foreign affairs), Gonzalo de Benito, to formally protest at the disproportionate border checks at the weekend and to seek an explanation of foreign minister (Jose) Garcia-Margallo's comments that he intends to target Gibraltar with future punitive measures.

‘The ambassador reiterated that the UK would stand shoulder to shoulder with Gibraltar in face of threats from Spain.’

The fisherman caught in the diplomatic row over Gibraltar has said that he feels he has been 'used' by his government.

The Spanish skipper of the Divina Providencia, Francisco Gomez Elias, has said that he just wants to be 'left alone to fish' after the agreement allowing Spanish vessels to fish off the Rock was revoked.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I am a pawn in the hands of politicians using me to make a point that that has little to do with my right to earn a living as a fisherman.'

Gibraltar authorities sunk 70 concrete blocks to form an artificial bay off the Rock, preventing all but line fishing.

In retaliation, Spanish guards carried out searches which led to queues of up to seven hours at the border.

But Mr Gomez refused to give up his fishing ground and has earned himself his own Spanish police marine guard.

The 50-year-old has been accused of breaching Gibraltar's nature laws with his method of dragging shellfish off the floor.

He will face court later this year.

He said that the irony is that he is fishing to supply restaurants in Gibraltar but is no longer allowed to fish in its waters.

'I am just trying to make a living and now I am having to fish further away where I can't find the same catch and spend more on fuel so it just isn't economically viable,"

'I don't want to get involved in the politics of it all, I just want to be left to fish in peace.'
