A man masquerading as a Good Samaritan molested a blind woman at one of Britain's busiest stations. 

Detectives have released CCTV footage of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident, at Waterloo station, London. 

Police say the victim was sexually assaulted by a man who offered to help her as she got off a tube train  with her guide dog just before 10am on Wednesday December 3.

BTP Detective Constable Suleman Yazdani said: 'The woman was travelling on a southbound Northern line train with her guide dog and a suitcase.

'As she moved to get off the service at Waterloo, she became aware of a man next to her.

'He offered to help her off the train, and took hold of her. 

'However, instead of helping his victim, the man sexually assaulted the woman before fleeing the scene.'

Another passenger came to the woman's aid, helping her to the ticket hall where she reported the incident to staff.

BTP detectives say they are following several lines of inquiry into the incident, and, after analysing CCTV, they have issued an image of a man who they believe will have information about what took place.

DC Yazdani said: 'The man who committed this offence masqueraded as a Good Samaritan, purely so he could take the opportunity to sexually assault his victim.

'We work extremely hard to make sure the Tube is a place where women can travel without the fear of unwanted sexual behaviour and are determined to find the person responsible for this assault.

'Who is the man in the picture? I think he could have information which can help us.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40, or text 61016, quoting reference TSUB/B6 of 26/01/2015. Information can also be passed anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
