Joe Hart has revealed that he has been working with a psychologist in order to improve his life both on and off the pitch. 

The 27-year-old goalkeeper was the standout performer alongside Lionel Messi on Wednesday night as Manchester City were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona.

City somehow managed to concede just one goal at the Nou Camp despite a dazzling display from Messi, who was thwarted by Hart on several occasions.

Hart spoke to Sport magazine about his meetings

Hart told Sport Magazine: 'I've got a relationship with someone who I've worked with for a while. It's a lot of fun. I like what I get out of it. Just generally – it's not necessarily just football and trying to 'unlock doors'. 

'It's just general – kind of free-flowing, feeling comfortable and safe to talk. Everyone could benefit from it, really, for life in general.'

The goalkeeper feels that having a strong mentality is key to being successful - especially being a goalkeeper.

'You can feel when someone is in a good place and when someone feels good about what they do, the same as I can feel it with strikers. So, to be in a naturally good place is a lot better. 

'You've got to believe in what you do and feel comfortable and confident when you go out. Being in the right frame of mind always helps – we all have vulnerable parts, times in our game when you're thinking the worst can happen. But you need to limit them as best you can.'

'I've always kind of accepted in my role as a goalkeeper that making mistakes is going to happen. But turning it into a positive is something that I've improved on, definitely.'

The England No 1 has been in fine form for his club this season, despite his defence struggling for form, but Hart admitted that making a save isn't quite the feeling as scoring a goal. 

'It's a very good feeling,' he says. 'It's a good surge. But the thing with making a save is that you can't run off and slide on your knees. Unless you've caught it, you've either pushed it out into play or pushed it for a corner. It's gone. 

'As good as making a good save can be, you've got to be aware that five seconds later you can let one through your hands.'

England's No 1 gets down low to deny Lionel Messi during his side's defeat to Barcelona at the Nou Camp

Despite going out of the Champions League on Wednesday, the 27-year-old made a crucial penalty save against Lionel Messi to keep his side well and truly in it after the first leg. 

'Penalties are an easy one to zone in on because it's a one-on-one duel. There's nothing that can be done – it's not like someone can do a sneaky one when you're not looking. 

'You try and make the moment as big for them as it is for you. Some people are immune to that, and you're wasting your time. But there's a few people who it might help with.

'Saving one is a good feeling. In my head it's all because of me. But, realistically, they might have just taken a bad penalty or made the wrong decision. Anyone is more than capable of scoring past me from 12 yards, whatever team it is.'
