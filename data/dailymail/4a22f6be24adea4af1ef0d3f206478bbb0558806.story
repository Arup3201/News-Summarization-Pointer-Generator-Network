Raheem Sterling is expected to be fit for Liverpool's crunch Champions League qualifying clash against Arsenal next Saturday after having an injection in his toe on Friday night.

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed the forward, who impressed against Lithuania, would miss the friendly against Italy to have the procedure in order to cure a long-standing toe complaint.

And Sportsmail can confirm Sterling had the injection at Wembley following the comprehensive 4-0 win in order to have maximum recovery time ahead of the visit to the Emirates Stadium.

Sterling has returned to Liverpool where the club's medical team will monitor his progress following the jab.

The 20-year-old has been playing through the pain barrier in recent weeks but the Anfield club are confident Sterling will be available, and fully fit, to face Arsene Wenger's side next Saturday.

Manager Brendan Rodgers will be desperate for his prized-asset to prove his fitness for the encounter, particularly with Daniel Sturridge out for a month due to injury.

Sterling could be used as a central striker at the Emirates Stadium next week, a role he has excelled in for Liverpool this season, given Sturridge's absence.
