When animal welfare workers found two Pit Bull pups roaming the streets of Philadelphia two months ago, they quickly realized there was no splitting them up.

Jermaine acts as a guide dog for his blind brother Jeffrey, gently nudging him in the right direction.

Now the eight-month-old orphans have a new home with a Springfield, Pennsylvania couple who say they're overwhelmed by the brothers' love.

Love is blind: Jermaine and Jeffrey are now living with their new owner Victoria McKee

Love is blind: This adorable picture of Jeffrey and Jermaine entwined on a bolster dog bed at the animal shelter went viral

The dogs became social media darlings last month when an adorable photo of them entwined while sleeping at a rescue shelter was shared around the world.

'When they walk, even on separate leashes, they are always bumping into each other to check that the other one is there,' new owner Victoria McKee told Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

'If Jermaine is off leash, he will run around and come back to check in with Jeffrey to make sure he's OK. If they're both off leash, they stay very close and Jermaine kind of herds Jeffrey around.

'It's remarkable how deep their bond really is.'

McKee and her husband Jonathan Hochman were selected to adopt the brothers from a pool of hopeful applicants, taking them home on November 25.

Although the gorgeous canines have recovered from the malnourishment, scrapes and upper respiratory ailments they gained while living on the streets, McKee said caring for a handicapped pup can be tough.

Jeffrey is blind in his left eye and sees only shadows with his right. But McKee said the pups are easy to get along with and love spending time with the family cat, Blabbus.

'We didn't just have to puppy proof, we had to blind puppy proof,' McKee said.

'As we continue to introduce them to new spaces, Jermaine always falls back to the role of caregiver and seeing-eye dog.'

The pups were put up for adoption by Operation Ava, a no-kill 
animal shelter that seeks to find forever homes for abandoned animals.

Operation Ava CEO Claudia Gutierrez said the shelter received thousands of applications after the cute picture of the dogs embracing went viral. But she said McKee and Hochman seemed like the perfect fit.

'They were looking for a pair of dogs to adopt together. They don’t have any children and decided that their pets are their children. They’re a really close couple,' she told Mainline Media News.

A Facebook page set up to keep people updated on Jermaine and Jeffrey's adventures has more than 37,000 likes.

McKee said Jeffrey and Jermaine have taught her and her husband the beauty of living simply. She said the dogs still cuddle when they sleep.

'We've learned the power of simplicity, from paring things back to ensure their safety,' she said.

'You really don't need much to be comfortable. A roof overhead, some food, a warm blanket, and family is really all you need.'
