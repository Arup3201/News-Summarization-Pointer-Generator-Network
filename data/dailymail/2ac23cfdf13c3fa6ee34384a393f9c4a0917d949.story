Guilty plea: Kathleen Cawthorne pleaded no contest to the charges after having sex with a student

A 33-year-old teacher who had sudden sex urges and slept with one of her students will only serve four months of her 11 year sentence.

Despite the prosecution demanding the minimum of a year behind bars, Kathleen Cawthorne, of Virginia, was shown leniency by the judge after she apologized for her actions.

The teacher's husband Duncan also said he was standing by his wife after she apologized for having sex with the 17 year old.

A court in Virginia was told that Cawthorne had been diagnosed with bipolar and she also had facets of hypersexuality - a sudden increase in sexual urges.

Cawthorne had sex with one of her students from the William Campbell Combined school,Rustburg, Virginia, in March 2012.

She picked up the teen and drove to a field where they had sex.

The pair also exchanged intimate photos of each other before the affair was discovered by school chiefs and Cawthorne arrested.

Cawthorne pleaded no contest to one charge of indecent liberties with a child and three counts of electronic solicitation of a minor in January.

At the sentencing hearing, Rick McGee, an associate pastor at Hyland Heights Baptist Church, testified that Cawthorne, a member of the church, had expressed 'extreme remorse' for what she had done.

He said Cawthorne had accepted responsibility for what she did.

McGee also said the church community would continue to be supportive of her as she worked on her recovery.

Prosecutor Brooke Willse-Gaddy said at the time the crimes were committed, Cawthorne had been 32 years old, nearly twice the age of her victim.

She said, as a teacher, Cawthorne was trained in reporting sexual abuse.

'We trust our teachers,' said Willse-Gaddy.

She said Cawthorne had violated that trust and asked the judge to exceed the guidelines and give Cawthorne at least a year in jail

Defense attorney Gordon Peters asked that his client receive no time to serve.

He said Cawthorne had no prior record and she could no longer teach.

Peters said having to register as a sex offender, meant she was 'essentially lepers in this day and age.'

Before judge John T Cook ordered her to serve four months Cawthorne apologized to her victim and to his family.

She also said she had apologized to the principal at William Campbell Combined School.
