Bacary Sagna hopes to have brought the FA Cup-winning formula with him to Manchester City.

The French defender was a key member of the Arsenal side that won the trophy with victory over Hull in last year's final.

That proved his final game for the Gunners before a summer switch to City and he has his sights set on more cup success.

The right-back said: 'I think it is a very good trophy, a very good competition because every single team is involved. It is a very difficult competition to win.

'I had the chance to win it last year with Arsenal and we had some tough moments. We played against some difficult teams.

'To win that cup meant something to me and I want to do it again.'

Sagna, 31, spent seven years with Arsenal before moving to the Etihad Stadium on a free transfer.

For him the Wembley victory was the ideal way to bow out, even though his move to the Barclays Premier League champions has not brought regular action.

He said: 'It was my first trophy with Arsenal in my last game, so it will always be special.

'It was very emotional, because I spent great years with Arsenal, because we went to Wembley previously and lost in the Carling Cup final, and because it was my last game.'

Sagna's opportunities at City have been limited because of the form of established right-back Pablo Zabaleta.

He could feature however as 2011 winners City begin their latest FA Cup quest at home to Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the third round on Sunday.

City thrashed the Owls 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September but Sagna says nothing should be taken for granted, remembering how Hull were inspired in last year's final.

The Tigers scored twice in the opening eight minutes at Wembley and Arsenal needed to fight back and force extra time before winning 3-2.

Sagna said: 'I remember conceding two goals quickly - after 10 minutes we were 2-0 down. In my head I was very focused and determined to come back.

'If I can remember that kind of game it means it can happen again. To stop it happening we have to dictate the game and stay focused, and keep looking forward. It might be a difficult game to play.' 

Sagna will hope that he can help Manuel Pellegrini to success in the FA Cup with Manchester City
