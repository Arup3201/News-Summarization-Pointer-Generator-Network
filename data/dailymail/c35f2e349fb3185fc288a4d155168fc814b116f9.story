Thanks to his ALS ice bucket challenge and topless strolls along Malibu beach, we've seen David Beckham's abs more than we've seen our own reflections this week - not that we're complaining.

The sports star has been putting his sculpted stomach on show as his has  latest underwear collection lands in H&M stores this week.

The 39-year-old gave us a sneak peek of his AW14 Bodywear designs a few months ago, and now we are finally able to stock up on the slouchy sleepwear and logo'd shorts for the men in our lives.

You're welcome: David Beckham has showcased his abs yet again as he celebrates the launch of his new Bodywear range for H&M, which lands in stores on Thursday

David's new range comprises of underwear and loungewear, all modelled to perfection by the former footballer.

The father-of-four designed the range himself and is clearly keen to show off the fruits of his labour, finishing the look with a messy hairstyle and his trademark stubble in the stylish black and white shoot,

Speaking about his latest collaboration with the high street giant, David said: 'These new pieces for my Bodywear range at H&M have a real energy about them.

'I genuinely enjoy the creative process and we have had fun this time playing with colour and texture.

'I hope people like them as much as I do.'

From footballer to designer: David says he genuinely enjoys the creative process  and says he's had fun playing with colour and texture - Victoria would be proud! 

Aside from launching his range, which lands on Thursday, David has been enjoying the sun-drenched beaches of Malibu with good friend Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana. 

David was the perfect doting dad during the outing, proudly taking photos of youngest son Cruz as he hit the waves on a surfboard.

He also made sure to spend plenty of time with his precious daughter Harper, diligently carrying a bright red bucket as he helped her build castles in the sand.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, David delighted fans when he accepted Ryan Seacrest's nomination to take part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that's sweeping the celebrity world right now.

The ripped star stripped down to just a pair of grey jeans for the soaking, posting the video to his Facebook page as he then nominated Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Leonardo DiCaprio to take part.

He abs-olutely loves showing off! David is clearly proud of his honed physique and loves taking his top off at every opportunity
