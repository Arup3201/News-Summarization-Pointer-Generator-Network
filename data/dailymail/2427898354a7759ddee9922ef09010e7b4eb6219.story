Sebastian Coe is today being urged to step down from some of his current work commitments if he wants the role of BBC Trust chairman.

The former track star and London 2012 chief is the frontrunner to replace Lord Patten, who stood down three weeks ago after heart surgery.

However, MPs are today urging Lord Coe to step down from some of his 20 other jobs to dedicate his time to the demanding role.

Whitehall sources claim that Lord Coe, pictured, is the leading contender to replace Chris Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust

Lord Coe is believed to earn around £1.5million a year. He is thought to earn about £500,000 as executive chairman at CSM Sport and Entertainment.

The Olympic hero, who charges around £25,000 to £50,000 for after dinner speeches, is also believed to earn £450,000 annually as a consultant to Chelsea FC and PruHealth.

He also has several unpaid jobs - including chairman of the British Olympic Association and trustee of the Sebastian Coe Foundation.

Concerns have been raised that Lord Coe will not be able to dedicate enough time to the role.

Labour's Gerry Sutcliffe told The Sun: 'It's be very difficult to give his full attention and do all the other things as well.'

Lord Coe's representatives have been approached for comment by MailOnline.

Downing Street is yet to comment on the rumors - which were first made by ITV News earlier this week.

However, Whitehall sources have confirmed
 Lord Coe is the leading candidate.

London Mayor Boris Johnson appeared to inadvertently confirm the story  when he said that Lord Coe was a ‘first-rate choice’.

Tory peer Lord Patten stood down as BBC Trust chairman after three turbulent years in charge. He said he could no longer do the job because of ill health

Mr Johnson said: ‘I think it’s fantastic news for the BBC and British broadcasting. Seb Coe is a great leader, I’ve worked with him a lot over the last few years and I think he’ll demand very high standards of the BBC.

‘I think he’ll be exactly in the right  tradition of British broadcasting.’

Yesterday Lord Coe, 57, did not deny he was linked to the role, saying only that he was ‘very flattered’ to be considered  a contender.

He said: ‘I think you will find that whenever any job at the moment comes up I seem to be slated in for it.

‘Either the Mayor of London, Fifa, International Olympic Committee. I’m very flattered, thank you,  but I’ve actually just got off a plane. I have absolutely nothing more  to say.’

After Lord Patten stood down, it was suggested that David Cameron wanted a woman to fill the role, with Dame Marjorie Scardino, the former chief executive of FTSE100 company Pearson, heavily tipped.

Lord Coe’s appointment would be popular among Tory MPs who remain concerned about left-wing bias within the corporation.

Seb Coe, who is rooted in the real world and renowned for his common sense would be an 'inspirational choice'

Unlike Lord Patten, he is seen as a ‘true Tory’ in his beliefs.

Coe was a Conservative MP for five years before losing his seat in the 1997 general election, returning to politics for a short time as  William Hague’s chief of staff after receiving a life peerage in 2000.

A double Olympic gold medallist in the Eighties, he has also already had a working relationship with BBC director-general Tony Hall.

In 2009, Hall, then chief executive of the Royal Opera House, was asked to chair a board to direct the Cultural Olympiad.

This gave Hall a seat on the board of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, which Coe chaired. Lord Coe would move into the job following a string of highly damaging scandals at the corporation.

The BBC was lambasted for its handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal that broke after the presenter’s death in 2011.

In November 2012 George Entwistle quit as director-general after a disastrous Newsnight programme wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine in a child sex abuse scandal.

The BBC has also been criticised after details emerged of shocking payoffs worth tens of millions of pounds to senior BBC managers.

Technological changes have also led to question marks about the future of the licence fee.

The BBC’s royal charter, which secures its funding from the  compulsory licence fee, which  currently costs £145.50, is up for renewal at the end of 2016.

As Sebastian Coe, he became a household name in 1980 when  he won the 1500 metres Olympic gold medal – a feat he repeated at the Los Angeles Games in 1984.

His victory over his great rival Steve Ovett in Moscow in 1980 is still seen as one of the great  Olympic stories.

He
 claimed the gold, crossing the line, arms aloft, only days after  
losing to Ovett over 800 metres, which was seen as Coe’s specialism.

After
 retiring from athletics, he was elected in 1992 as a Tory MP for the 
Cornwall constituency of Falmouth and Camborne until his defeat in the 
1997 election.

He was 
chairman of Britain’s triumphant bid to host the 2012 Olympics, and took
 the same role in the committee organising the Games, which were widely 
seen as one of the most successful in recent years.

The
 formal selection process for the chair of the BBC – for which Lord 
Patten was paid £110,000 a year for a three-day week – will be overseen 
by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid.

The appointment would be  formally approved by the Prime Minister and rubber-stamped by the Queen.
