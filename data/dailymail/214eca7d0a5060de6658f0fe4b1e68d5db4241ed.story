CBS has forced 60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan and her producer to take a leave of absence due to their discredited story about the attack on the American embassy in Benghazi.

The move comes after a critical internal review of the controversial October segment which relied heavily on the testimony of a supposed witness whose account has now been proved as false.

The review by CBS News executive Al Ortiz said the 60 Minutes team- and specifically Logan and her producer Max McClellan- should have done a better job vetting the former security contractor later identified as Dylan Davies.

Sorry is not enough: Lara Logan publicly apologized for the Benghazi report twice but on Tuesday CBS announced that they were putting her on a leave of absence one month after the original segment aired

Immediately after the segment aired on October 27, questions were quickly raised about whether the man was lying — something 60 Minutes should have better checked out before airing the story, the report said.

Producer: Max McClellan was also put on a leave of absence starting on Tuesday for his involvement in the story

'Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night,' the report stated.

The report also said Logan should not have done the story in the first place after making a speech in Chicago a year ago claiming that it was a lie that America's military had tamed al Qaeda.

'From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story,' Ortiz concluded, as seen in the full memo published on The Huffington Post.

CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager, who is also the 60 Minutes executive producer, said he had asked Logan and McClellan to take a leave of absence of an undetermined length.

Fager said he prides himself on catching almost everything, 'but this deception got through and it shouldn't have.'

There was no word about whether Fager will face any repercussions for his role.

'The
 60 Minutes journalistic review is concluded, and we are implementing 
ongoing changes based on its results,' said CBS News spokeswoman Sonya 
McNair, not making clear what those changes were. 

Under scrutiny: An internal review concluded that Logan and her producer should have vetted the source more thoroughly and used other channels at CBS to get more information from government sources

The original segment relied heavily on the testimony of Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used 
while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said 
that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived
 at the consulate on the evening of the attack.

He also said that he later saw the body of Ambassador Chris Stevens when he went to a local hospital that evening.

The newsmagazine believed his account that he was at the scene even after informing CBS that he told his employers that he wasn't there — something that Ortiz said should have raised a 'red flag' about his story.

'This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process,' the report stated.

In hiding: Dylan Davies told a story that has now been proved to be false during a 60 Minutes interview and has since received death threats against his family

Logan has not made any statement regarding her suspension, which was announced on Tuesday as many people started heading out of town for the Thanksgiving holiday, but she was then one to make two public apologies less than a week after the original segment aired.

Logan said during her on-air mea culpa on November 8 that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of events that he was telling CBS and the Blue Mountain Group report. Before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the company’s report to go along with his boss’ story which said that Davies tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he couldn’t make it.

'His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said.

She made it clear that what they did not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it.

Logan said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him.

‘We were misled and we were wrong and 
that's the important thing and that's what we have to say here: we have 
to set the record straight and take responsibility,’ she said.

'The
 most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and 
today the truth is we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any 
journalist, that's very disappointing for me.

‘Nobody
 likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to 
stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong
 and in this case we were wrong.’

Davies
 motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he 
is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the U.S. 
government about security flaws before the attack.

The publisher of the book, The Embassy House, has now said that they have retracted the book.

Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book

It had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling the book.

The book itself was another problem for '60 Minutes' because while they did disclose that Davies had a book that was being published, they failed to mention that Threshold Editions is an imprint of Simon & Schuster which is owned by CBS.

CNN said that they got a statement from Davies who said that his book is 'consistent' with what he told U.S. authorities and the FBI, but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports.

When asked about what steps they took to vet that Davies was telling the truth before they put him on air, Logan said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided.

'We verified that he was who he said he was, that he was working for the State Department at the time, that he was in Benghazi at the Special Mission compound the night of the attack,' she said on CBS' morning news show.

'He gave us access to communications that he had with government officials. we used US government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details  of his story and everything checked out. He also showed us photographs that he had taken at the Special Mission compound the following morning.'
