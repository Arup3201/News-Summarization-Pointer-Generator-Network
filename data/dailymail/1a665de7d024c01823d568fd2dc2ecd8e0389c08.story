A shocked traveller who was quoted a price of £23.7billion for a flight to Portugal has been offered a €40 (£31.30) voucher and an apology as a goodwill gesture from comparison website eDreams.

Marion Sessions had searched for flights from Birmingham to Faro in the Algarve region when eDreams returned the cheapest prices she could find for flights with Ryanair and Monarch. 

But having gone through to process of booking her flights 'without a hitch', Sessions got a rude shock when the final price of £23,659,382,125.95 was offered.

That'll be £23,659,382,125.95 thanks! The price quoted by eDreams to Marion Sessions for a flight to Faro

'It all went swimmingly until I entered this extra piece of luggage for the return journey and I all but clicked "Purchase",' Sessions posted on a blog. 

'What would have happened if I had? Neither of us has £23.7 billion to spare … What would have happened to my credit rating?!! We might have had to up our rates for our holiday cottages by several million.' 

When Sessions called eDreams she couldn't leave a message but her email query did get an automated response.

'Quickly an email appeared, urging me "Don’t miss out on your dream flight deal to Faro (FAO)! We’ve saved the flight to Faro you were searching for on eDreams. A second one reassured us, "We hope you find everything you’re looking for on eDreams".'

eDreams has since made contact with Sessions and attempted to make amends with the baffled customer, who runs two romantic holiday cottages in the Peak District village of Parwich, taking it all in good spirit.

'We have now received an apology of sorts from eDreams, who assure us in what looks horribly like an automated email that the "price issue detected has been solved". One would hope so, too!' she said in a subsequent blog post.

'They have offered us an "eDreams Voucher for the value of €40 as a commercial gesture" against our next flight, but I don’t think we’ll bother trying again! €40 does seem quite modest compared with £23.7bn but we appreciate the gesture.

'The whole episode – after the initial shock – has provided everyone with a lot of harmless fun!'

A statement from eDreams said: 'eDreams would like to apologise to Mrs Sessions for any inconvenience caused. We are continuing to investigate, however it appears to be an isolated incident that we have been unable to replicate. If it is a bug, we will find it and make every effort to fix it immediately.

'eDreams would like to re-iterate that at no point was there any attempt to make this purchase. We would also like to provide the added re-assurance that any attempt at a transaction of this size would automatically be rejected by our systems and unable to proceed.'
