A soldier and a 34-year-old woman were arrested in Tennessee after they were spotted having sex on a stranger's lawn in the early hours of Sunday.

When police questioned Justin Moore, 25, and Jennifer Cogdill, they smelled strongly of alcohol, had slurred speech and admitted to being drunk.

Their intimate encounter had been reported to police after a passerby spotted the couple from the road in Clarksville, near Tennessee.

When they saw an officer getting out of his police car, the pair 'separated', according to a warrant.

When asked by police how much they had had to drink, the pair admitted to being very drunk, the Tennessean reported.

Neither of them lived at the address where they had been spotted. Moore listed his home as being on the Fort Cambell base in Kentucky, about half an hour from Clarksville.

Cogdill gave her address as Memorial Drive, in Clarksville, less than a 10 minute drive from where she was arrested.

Moore and Cogdill were both charged with indecent exposure and public intoxication. They were booked into county jail and bond was set at $1,500 each.

Moore is a soldier based at Fort Cambell, which is about 25 minutes from where he was spotted with Cogdill
