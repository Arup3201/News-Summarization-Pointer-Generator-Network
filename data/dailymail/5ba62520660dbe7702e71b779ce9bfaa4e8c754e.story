A British teenager who lost his leg after contracting meningitis as a boy became a Paralympic hero tonight as he won gold at London 2012.

Jonnie Peacock, 19, won his eagerly-awaited sprint final against fellow blade runner Oscar Pistorius to become the 100m champion in a Paralympic record time of 10.90secs.

The success for Peacock, from Shepreth, Cambridgeshire, which was eagerly watched by a record 6.3 million viewers, was all the sweeter given his remarkable recovery from a condition which almost killed him 14 years ago.

Peacock was only five when he contracted meningitis in October 1998.

He was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, where he lay in a coma for four days with doctors warning his parents that he may not survive.

Blood poisoning meant that surgeons had to amputate his right leg just below the knee to rid his body of the deadly infection.

But he was determined not to be beaten by his disability and fought to enjoy his childhood as much as possible, even cycling with his sisters.

His improvement was so dramatic that his family had their benefits cut only 18 months after he was taken ill.

When
medics assessed Peacock in 2000, they were so impressed by his 
athleticism that they decided he could move like any other 
seven-year-old.

It meant the weekly payment to his mother of £92.25 in disability benefit was halted for six months from February 2000.

The family appealed against the decision and the Benefits Agency agreed to make payments of £51.30 a week in mobility allowance.

The agency also agreed to backdate 
the missed payments and guaranteed that the family would receive 
financial support until Peacock was 16.

Peacock was inspired to remain 
athletic after he met England football stars Michael Owen and David 
Beckham on a visit to watch the national team in 2000.

That
year he was also able to take up ballet and, fitted with an artificial 
limb, he attended weekly dance classes at his local village hall from 
the age of eight.

His proud mother Linda Roberts, now 46, said Peacock had been a fighter ever since he lost his leg.

Ms
Roberts, of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, added: 'A doctor told me my 
little boy had 48 hours to live and that now was the time to say 
goodbyes. But I couldn’t.

'People
say he’s wonderful because he’s achieving all these great things but 
for me he doesn’t have to win a race for me to be proud of him.

'When
you remember the little boy who stared down at his leg and wondered 
what had happened to his world, you remember how far he’s come.

'He’s beaten greater battles than Oscar Pistorius.

'Just competing is such a fantastic achievement for him.'

The 19-year-old poster boy, who had 
promised to ‘shock the world’ at London 2012, lived up to his boast by 
claiming the title of the world’s ‘fastest amputee’.

Roared
on by 80,000 packed inside the Olympic Stadium, Peacock blazed up the 
track to win the most eagerly anticipated clash of the Paralympics. 
Pistorius finished fourth.

It
came on a magnificent night for Paralympic GB that saw wheelchair 
racers David Weir and Hannah Cockcroft power to victories as Britain 
smashed its medal target in London 2012 with three days of competition 
still to go.

For Weir, 33, his win in the T54 800m completed a brilliant hat-trick of golds before his home crowd, while 20-year-old Cockcroft’s win in the T34 women’s 200m was her second gold of the Paralympic Games in the stadium.

Their successes helped to propel Team GB past their Beijing medal haul of 102 and London 2012 target total of 103 with realistic prospects of at least another 20 medals.

The distinction of winning GB’s 103rd medal fell to swimmer Heather Frederiksen, claiming silver in the S8 100m freestyle.

More
than one million people have paid so far to watch Paralympic athletes 
give their inspirational performances in London’s Olympic Stadium – 
meaning it has been the most commercially successful of any Paralympics 
so far.

The clash between 
Peacock and Pistorius was considered the Blue Riband event and had been 
among the most talked about of London 2012.

The win could now be worth a fortune to Peacock, with companies and backers lining up for him to endorse their products.

The
defeat means that Pistorius, the world’s most famous Paralympian, has 
now been beaten in his first two individual events at London 2012 
although he did take South Africa to a relay gold medal on Wednesday.

For
Britain, a new star emerged last night when 15-year-old swimmer Josef 
Craig won his first Paralympic gold medal in spectacular style.

The
teenager won the S7 400m freestyle in a world record time of four 
minutes 42.81 seconds. It trumped the world record he had set hours 
earlier in the heats by three seconds – to the amazement of his rivals.

Craig, who has cerebral palsy, punched the air and blew kisses to the crowd after his win.

The schoolboy, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, said: ‘It means more than anything in the world. It’s the happiest day of my life.’

A record audience of more than six million tuned in to watch Jonnie Peacock’s lightning 100m gold - the biggest of the Paralympics so far.

The nation has continued to take the Games to its heart, as athletes perform in sell-out crowds and millions watch at home.

'Thriller Thursday' was capped in stunning fashion in the Olympic Stadium last night as David Weir, Hurricane Hannah Cockroft and Peacock all won gold.

Ratings for the coverage show the 100m showdown - which also featured Oscar Pistorius - pulled in a huge 6.3 million viewers.

Including the Paralympic Extra live streams, the peak was 6.7 million.

The figure smashed the previous highest for a live event, which was 4.4million for Sunday’s 200m race in which Pistorius lost to Brazilian Alan Oliveira.

David 'The Weirwolf' Weir drew 5.5 million for his stunning 800m victory and 4.1 million watched Halifax flier Cockroft storm to 200m gold last night.

The combined audience made the broadcaster the most watched television channel in the UK.

Viewing figures have been steadily growing for the Paralympics, which started with 11.4 million people watching the opening ceremony last Wednesday night.

An audience of 2.9 million watched swimmer Ellie Simmonds take gold in Saturday’s S6 400m freestyle event.

The channel later said the viewing figures were its highest for any show in the past 10 years, and the ceremony is one of its most watched broadcasts of all time.

The popularity of the Paralympics led Channel 4 to alter its schedules early in the Games, with all non-related content being taken off the air.

Previously, coverage had reverted to More4 in the late afternoon with a selection of shows including Deal Or No Deal and The Simpsons being screened - but these have now been dropped in favour of non-stop coverage of the Games, broken only by Channel 4 News at 7pm.

Channel 4’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt said: 'The coverage of the Paralympics has completely captured the public’s imagination.'
