A 63-year-old lung cancer survivor defended herself from a home intruder by hitting him over the head with a wooden backscratcher until he ran out the door in fear.

Patty Kearny, 63, of Marion, Indiana has chronic respiratory problems and needs and oxygen tank to breathe but she didn't let her illness get in the way of forcefully bashing a burglar over the head on Monday night.

Kearny and her husband Don had been enjoying a quiet night in when they heard a sound like glass breaking in another room in the house, reports People.

Don went to check on the noise and was greeted by an intruder wearing a hockey mask and holding a wrench.

The intruder demanded that the couple hand over any guns they had in the home.

ABC reports that the intruder ordered Patty to use duct tape to tie up her husband but that when Patty discovered the burglar didn't have a gun she was determined to fight back.

Her husband stood with his hands in the air but Patty wasn't going to surrender.

'I don't think he expected an overweight woman on oxygen to attack him, I really don't.' said Kearney of her brave attack.

Patty pummeled the male suspect over the head until he dropped his wrench and she says wasn't impressed nor was she intimidated by his choice of wardrobe.

'[The] guy had a "Jason" mask, a hockey mask on,' she said.

'I almost started laughing,' she joked.

After the burglar dropped his wrench, patty picked it up and decided to use that as a weapon.

'I said not in my house, not in my house,' Patty told FOX.

'I just hit him in the head, hit him in the head ... and I hit him once more and he ran out the door.'

The Marion Police Department have not yet identified a suspect.

Patty has since installed a security system in her home and she's keeping the burglar's wrench close by just in case he decides to visit them again.

The Mail Online contacted the police department but no one was available for comment.
