The £1,500 no-risk stake in RBS and Lloyds would be the biggest privatisation ever seen in Britain

Up to 48 million taxpayers could be offered a £1,500 no-risk stake in RBS and Lloyds in the biggest ever privatisation ever seen in Britain.

A blueprint published today suggests that up to £34billion of the government’s £48billion of shares in RBS and Lloyds would end up in the hands of individual voters.

Every British resident over the age of 18 who has a National Insurance number and is registered on the electoral roll could apply for a share.

The scheme has been devised by centre-Right think tank Policy Exchange and is understood to be being studied closely in the Treasury.

An announcement of plans for a share giveaway could come in Chancellor George Osborne’s speech to London’s Mansion House in ten days’ time.

Today’s report suggests that every taxpayer should be eligible to apply to be handed a ‘free’ stake in the two banks, which were part-nationalised by Gordon Brown in the banking crash of 2008 and 2009. They would keep the profits when the shares were sold.

An alternative plan is for people to be able to buy shares at a discount.

Senior Tories believe the move will be a moment of huge political significance as it will be billed ‘payback time’ from the banking sector, as well as creating a new generation of shareowners. One described it privately as ‘electoral catnip’.

Mr Osborne is said to believe a privatisation with discounted or given-away shares could rekindle the excitement of the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign, in which five million people bought shares in British Gas -- a move which is credited with helping the Tories win the 1987 general election.

A senior Treasury source confirmed the Policy Exchange proposal was ‘one interesting idea among many’, though he insisted no decisions had been taken.

Today’s report, written by James Barty, former head of global equity strategy at Deutsche Bank, examines all the options available to the government and concludes that a distribution of shares in both RBS and LLoyds to taxpayers be repaid on sale, combined with a separate sale to institutional investors, is the best solution.

It would mean 50 to 55 per cent of shares in RBS and 30 per cent of shares in Lloyds being distributed to taxpayers who are able to apply for them at no initial cost. They would only be paid for at the time of sale.

For taxpayers, this could mean between £1,100 and £1,650 worth of shares being allocated depending on the number of applicants.

The report estimates that between 20 and 30 million would apply, meaning a likely stake of around £1,500.

A
floor price would be established at the original level the shares are 
sold.If the share price falls under the floor, no-one would be expected 
to want to sell since they would not profit at all.

Instead, taxpayers would take the profits from any rise in the share price above the floor price but would not lose any money if the share price dropped below the floor price.

If the share price never exceeds the floor price, the shares would be returned to government ownership after ten years.

This gives taxpayers confidence in taking on shares as there is no downside or upfront cost. The shares would be held in a nominee account.

Individuals can then transfer their shareholding into a personal account should they wish, providing they have paid the government the floor price.

At the same time of the mass distribution, 25 per cent of shares in RBS and the remainding shares in Lloyds would be sold to institutional and retail investors.

The Treasury could raise approximately £17-18 billion through institutional and retail sales alone.

The Treasury is considering the plan. George Osborne is said to believe a privatisation of this kind would excite the electorate

The report says that by offering a large portion of its shareholding to taxpayers in this way, the government would be able to move much if not all of the banks into private ownership in one go, at a better price than through a traditional sale, while at the same time giving the taxpayer the bulk of the upside.

It identified flaws in other options to privatise the banks before the general election in 2015, saying there was not enough time for a stage sale to institutional investors and the shares would have to be sold at a discount.

A simple shares giveaway would increase the national debt by £50 billion and wad therefore a ‘non-starter’.

‘Any privatisation has to be done in a way that will strengthen the banks and allows them to compete on a fully commercial basis when back in private hands,’ Mr Barry said.

‘In our view that means finding a solution that moves the banks quickly from the public to the private sector, while at the same time generating a stable share price and an opportunity for the banks to raise capital. It is also key that the taxpayer still benefits from any further rise in the share price.

‘A distribution to taxpayers with the government to be repaid on sale, combined with an institutional and retail placing, is the only option that allows almost all the government’s stake in the banks to be sold ahead of a 2015 election.

It also offers the most stable share price as distributed shares would not be sold below the price to be repaid to the government.

This proposal will create a whole new generation of shareholders. We urge the Chancellor to take on the doubters and move ahead with this scheme.’

Labour had indicated it would fight a full-scale shares giveaway.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls declared last month that he would oppose the coalition’s moves to divest itself of the shares currently held by the government if it would adversely affect Britain’s deficit.

‘A giveaway or a loss-making firesale at the current share price would add billions to the national debt at a time when poor economic growth already means borrowing isn’t coming down,’ he said.

The Treasury source added: ‘We genuinely don’t have some secret plan for bank share sales and are not in any mad rush.’

The two banks have both said they expect to be ready to return to the private sector in 2014.
