Eleven children are among 48 people who drowned in Bangladesh today when a ferry carrying at least 100 passengers capsized and sank.

The ferry collided with a cargo vessel and foundered within minutes on the Padma River. It was the second deadly boat accident in a fortnight in Bangladesh, which has a history of ferry tragedies.

About 50 passengers were able to swim ashore or tread water long enough to be rescued. Divers were tonight working under floodlights to pick bodies from the water.

Officials admitted they did not know the exact number of people missing.

'Divers have recovered 41 bodies. The dead included 11 children and seven women,' local police chief Rakibuz Zaman told AFP. The death toll has risen throughout the day.

Survivors said the MV Mostofa was overcrowded with about 70-150 passengers crammed into the upper and lower decks. They were left scrambling to find loved ones when the tragedy struck.

'I was holding my mother’s hand when the cargo boat hit our ferry from behind,' an 18-year-old who gave his name as Al Amin told AFP at the terminal.

'Within two minutes the ferry was sunk. Before I realised I was washed away to the middle of the river.

'I swam and a ferry rescued me. But I don’t know what happened to my mum.'

Police chief Zaman said some 50 people 'swam ashore or were rescued by other vessels'.

Local newspaper Prothom Alo quoted one survivor, Hafizur Rahman, as saying tragedy struck 15 minutes after departure. Many passengers were trapped beneath decks and unable to escape.

'I was on the deck of the ferry and fell into the river. Those who were on the deck were able to come out but none of the passengers inside could get out,' Mr Rahman told the paper.

Bangladeshi ferries do not normally keep passenger lists, making it difficult to establish how many are missing after an accident.

An official said a salvage vessel was on its way to raise the sunken ferry, adding that the master of the cargo ship and two other crew had been arrested.

The ferry was submerged 20ft beneath the surface of the river, said Inspector Zihad Mia, who is overseeing the rescue operation.

'We don’t have a clear picture about how many were exactly in the ferry when it sank,' Insp. Mia told Reuters. 'But I think many have survived.'

Rescuers were unloading bodies from small boats at the ferry terminal in Paturia, some 50 miles from the capital Dhaka. People have gathered there to identify the dead.

'We found one body but five are still missing,' Hindu holy man Kumud Ranjan Goswami said. 'We were returning home after the opening of a temple'

Authorities ordered an investigation into the accident and a five-member committee has been asked to submit a report within 15 days, the Ministry of Shipping said in a statement.

The Padma river is one of the largest in Bangladesh, a nation formed around the delta of the great River Ganges and criss-crossed by more than 230 rivers.

Boats are the main form of travel in many of the remote rural areas, especially in the south and north-east of the country, which is one of Asia's poorest. Capsizes are common.

Experts blame poorly maintained vessels, flaws in design and overcrowding for most of the tragedies.

This month, at least five people including a child were killed when an overloaded ferry carrying some 200 passengers capsized in an estuary in the south of the country.

About 50 people were also killed in August last year when a crowded ferry sank in rough weather in the Munshiganj district.

Naval officials have said more than 95 per cent of Bangladesh’s hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized boats do not meet minimum safety regulations.
