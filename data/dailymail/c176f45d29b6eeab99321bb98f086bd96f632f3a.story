Suri's adventures with her daddy hit new heights today as Tom whisked her off on a helicopter ride.

The six-year-old - who reunited with her action hero father yesterday for the first time since his split from Katie Holmes - looked a little sleepy as the pair ventured out this morning in New York.

They were pictured leaving the Greenwich Hotel before making their way to Chelsea Piers to board the aircraft.

Up, up and away: Suri Cruise was taken on a helicopter ride by her father Tom Cruise today in New York

Doting daddy: The actor is making the most of his time with Suri after 
being away from her for the past few weeks while filming his movie 
Oblivion

Suri was wearing her favourite orange dress, which she has been sporting for the past three days.

She was also carrying a cuddly toy and
a doll, while Tom - who was once again carrying his daughter, wrapped 
her up in a pink blanket.

Their outing came as Tom's lawyer Bert Field sent out an angry email to Life&Style magazine over it's cover story today saying Suri had been 'Abandoned by her dad'.

Fields told TMZ: 'That, as anyone knows who saw their photos together yesterday and today, is a disgusting, vicious lie.'

'Until this week, Tom was shooting a film on location, but he spoke to Suri every day.'

'He's with Suri right now; and he was with her the day before Life & Style trumpeted their cruelly false accusation.  Tom dearly loves Suri and the last thing he would ever do is abandoned her.'

Yesterday marked the first time the 
father and daughter had spent time together in recent weeks as he had 
filming commitments with his new movie, Oblivion.

Tom, 50, took Suri to her gymnastics class yesterday, before heading back to his hotel with her.

The
dark-haired youngster was obviously feeling ready for bed and flung her
arms around the actor and buried her face into his neck.

Tom headed straight to the Big Apple 
after shooting on the his latest movie Oblivion wrapped in California on
Monday and he flew in overnight.

His sister Cass Mapother was also seen arriving at the establishment with toys in tow.

Tom had no contact with Katie when he made a five 
minute visit to her apartment to collect their child yesterday morning, according to TMZ.

Tom and Suri were last spotted in public
together on June 16, when they dined at Sushi Samba in Reykjavik, 
Iceland, along with Katie. 

It
was no doubt an emotional reunion for father and daughter, who have 
been keeping in touch via phone and video chat in recent weeks.

It
would have been even more poignant given last night's scare which saw 
Katie and Suri involved in a car accident, capping off a tumultuous time
for the little girl.

The former Dawson's Creek actress and daughter  were riding in the back of a black Mercedes 
sedan when it was struck by a dump truck in New York on Monday evening.

No one was reported hurt in the incident, which onlookers say was minor.

One source said: 'It was nothing major other than the fact that it was Katie Holmes.'

Police
arrived on the scene and noted the actress' chauffeur-driven vehicle 
had sustained a large dent and several scratches to the rear driver side
panel after the Volvo truck - from Classic Sanitation Recycling New 
York Corp - had apparently backed into the luxury vehicle.

Katie - who filed for divorce from 
her daughter's father, actor Tom Cruise, last month - and Suri were not 
seen at the scene of the crash.

Last week the Mission Impossible star's 
lawyer, Bert Fields said the actor was eager to be with his daughter 
again, adding: 'Tom loves Suri very, very much, as he does his other two
children. Tom is a family man, and dedicated to his children. They are 
the centre of his world.'

Tom's older children Isabella, 19, and 
17-year-old Connor from his marriage to Nicole Kidman have both been 
spending time with him in recent weeks, including sombre birthday 
celebration on July 3.

Following
her split from Tom on June 29, Katie has secured primary custody of 
their little girl in an undisclosed divorce agreement.

It was recently revealed she has 
enrolled Suri into New York's Convent of the Sacred Heart School.

The conservative school - where
former pupils include Lady Gaga and Paris Hilton - was chosen because the actress 
wants her daughter to have a Catholic education, rather than being 
taught at a Scientology school as the Mission: Impossible star desired.
