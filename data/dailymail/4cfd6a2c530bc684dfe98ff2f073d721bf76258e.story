A heartwarming video shows the moment a pro-wrestler asks a autistic teenager if he can take her to her junior prom after finding out that the girl is his biggest fan. 

Amanda Styles contacted independent pro-wrestler Ace Perry on Facebook to tell him she goes to see his matches every week and loves watching him compete.

But she never dreamed that at his next match in Clarksville, Indiana, Perry, would ask if he could escort her to prom.

'Yes!' Amanda replies excitedly. She then hugs Perry, adding: 'Thank you so much.' 

'My decision to ask her was the promoter's idea and he had told me she's a great person who tries to help out special needs kids herself,' Perry told 14News.

'As you know she's a huge fan of mine and knowing I can help make her happy by doing this is great. I still feel like I haven't taken it all in. It's just crazy.'

Perry turns to Amanda and asks: 'Don't you have, like, your junior prom coming up or something like that?'

Perry's touching gesture earned him a number of fans on Twitter, with one posting: 'That is such an awesome thing for you to do! #heartofgold.'

Another wrote: 'Dude you're amazing. I hope you guys have fun.'

In response to the outpouring of praise, Perry tweeted: 'I'm overwhelmed. Crazy all the attention that's been brought. Thanks to EVERYONE for their kind words. I hope Ms. Amanda is happy.'

As the crowd starts chanting 'Yes', Perry continues: 'Amanda, will you do me the honor and privilege of letting me take you to your junior prom?'

'Yes!' Amanda replies excitedly, after being asked to prom. She then hugs Perry, adding: 'Thank you so much'
