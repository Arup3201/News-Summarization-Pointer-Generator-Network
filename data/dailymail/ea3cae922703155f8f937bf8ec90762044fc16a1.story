Eat sensibly, never count calories and don't keep bathroom scales at home.

Those are breakfast TV queen Lorraine Kelly's top tips for keeping in shape after three decades in front of the cameras.

In an interview in The Times the ITV presenter says she 'won't countenance' bathroom scales in her home and if she can't fit into a certain pair of trousers she knows it's time to do something about it.

The 55-year-old also says she would prefer to grow old gracefully, and would never consider Botox.

She says: 'I would never, ever, ever mess around with my face. Ever.'

Size 12 Lorraine, who once famously said 'life's too short to glower at a lettuce leaf', reckons she has lost and gained the equivalent of three rugby players over the course of her 30-year career.

Lorraine tells the Times that her confidence peak came at 50, when she realised she looked 'fine'.

In 2008 Lorraine, who first appeared on TV screens in 1984 as TV-am’s Scotland Correspondent, was the face of The Sun's Fit Squad Diet in which she managed to drop a dress size in six weeks.

Three years later, in 2011, she lost more than a stone and dropped two dress sizes after taking part in a 100km desert trek for Comic Relief.

Lorraine now writes a column for The Scottish Sun in which she often tackles obesity.

She says: 'Junk food is cheap and, actually, it's not bad to have junk food now and again.'

'It's just that you see kids being weaned on it. I think schools should teach many things, but [here are] three: they should teach sex education; they should teach how to manage your finances; and they should teach you how to bloody well cook. It would set kids up for life.'

Meanwhile, Lorraine - who's an ambassador for Avon cosmetics - recently unveiled her new ad campaign for JD Williams' new spring collection.

She showed off the range of floral dresses, bright separates, jumpsuits and pieces from her own collection for the mature fashion retailer.

The advert - a multi-million pound campaign by JD Williams - was filmed on location in Cape Town, South Africa and features Lorraine at a lively summer garden party dancing with friends to the Gipsy King’s salsa track, Bamboleo. 

The TV queen's dance moves were inspired by her Zumba fitness classes, which she enjoys three times a week, along with walking regularly to keep fit and healthy.

Speaking about her latest campaign, Lorraine said: 'The shoot for the spring TV advert was so much fun and we all had such a giggle! 

'The women looked so summery and stylish. I hope the collection will be big hit for women looking for great fashionable styles and fit.'
