An Australian couple have made a desperate plea for help after they became stranded in Thailand with their newborn twins, born via a Thai surrogate mother.

Kate and Adam Osborne, from Kempsey, on the mid north coast of New South Wales, are one of the many Australian couples who have become locked in legal battles after changes to Thailand's commercial surrogacy laws.

They reportedly turned to Thai surrogacy as a last resort after numerous failed IVF attempts in Australia.

'They are in a tiny motel room with two newborns and money is running out fast,' their friend Jen Farrell wrote on a fundraising page set up to help the family.

Kate and Adam Osborne's twin daughters, Mali and Sierra-Leone, were born in Thailand on July 22 on the same day that Thai laws regarding commercial surrogacy changed

At the end of July, the laws in Thailand radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave the country with their children without a court order granting consent from the birth mother.

Anyone who disobeys this law could potentially be charged with child trafficking.

Mr and Mrs Osborne's twin daughters, Mali and Sierra-Leone, were born in Thailand on July 22, just weeks before the horrific story of baby Gammy emerged and shocked the world. 

Gammy, also a twin, was born to a Thai surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, but was allegedly abandoned by his West Australian parents because he had Down syndrome.

Gammy's biological father David Farnell later revealed in a 60 Minutes interview he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child's Down syndrome sooner, saying: 'No parent wants a son with a disability'.

Mr Osborne explained that they can not simply bring their children home to Australia now, despite having all the required Australian documentation.

The couple from NSW turned to a Thai surrogate after failed IVF attempts in Australia. They are currently stranded in a Thai motel with their newborn girls

'Our twin girls have all their relevant paperwork (Australian citizenship, Australian passports),' he said while decribing his 'Thailand horror story'.

'Before the Thai army cracked down on commercial surrogacy on the twins birthday (22/7/2014)  you could just leave the country without anyone batting an eyelid with your new family.

'Now its a different story, now its considered "Human trafficking" because they see it as though we are stealing someones children, and if they ask to see babies' birth certificate that is proof because our surrogate's name is on certificate as their mother.

'We had D.N.A tests done and our babies are our babies and in no way, shape or form are related to birth mother (our surrogate). So we have to go through the courts now and get a court order to leave the country,' he explained.

The young couple had already tried many unsuccessful rounds of IVF treatment in Australia before they went overseas to use a surrogate mother.

Kate's sister Sonia told the Macleay Argus 'this was their last chance' at having children.

'Believe me, they have tried everything and this was not an easy option to take.

'We just want them home with their girls to be with their family.

'Their families have only seen a picture of the little girls and all we want to do is hold them in our arms. It's heartbreaking.'

The couple reportedly missed their planned flight home this week as the Thai authorities blocked them from leaving with their girls.

Meanwhile, a same-sex couple who are also caught up in the crackdown on surrogacy in Thailand have told the Sydney Morning Herald they know at least 20 Australian couples who are now stuck in Bangkok hotels.

'This is very emotionally draining. We had a meeting and I told them not to be stressed, to enjoy the fact they have their babies,' Steve said.

The 46-year-old from Melbourne said he and his partner James are waiting to see if they can bring their baby boy Rhyley home.

He explained that the Australian couples he had spoken to thought they would be in Thailand for five or six weeks and 'now there are rumours they will have to stay three months or six months, or who knows how long'.

He said many are experiencing financial difficulties.

A recent statement from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, regarding Australian parents being prevented from bringing their children home from Thailand, said: 'We have been advised that Thai authorities may enforce enhanced documentation requirements when exiting the country, when they suspect a child has been born by surrogacy in Thailand.

Mr Osborne explained that they can not simply bring their children home to Australia now, despite having all the required Australian documentation

'The Australian Government's Smartraveller website was updated on 14 August to reflect these requirements.

'We strongly urge Australians entering Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both Thailand and Australia before doing so. In particular, they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements.

'While regulation of surrogacy in Thailand is a matter for Thailand, we continue to encourage Thai authorities to adopt appropriate transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce, so concerned Australians are not unduly affected.'

Mr and Mrs Osborne are hoping to raise money to pay for new flights home and for the cost of their unexpectedly long stay in Thailand.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the couple for comment.
