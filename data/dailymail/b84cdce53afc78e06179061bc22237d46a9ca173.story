It's one of those first world problems that can annoy people on a daily basis.

Having to wait for a drink to cool down, or sipping it after it has already gone cold, can ruin a perfectly good cup of tea.

After suffering one too many scalding beverages, one inventor has launched a mug that keeps drinks at a perfect temperature.

Burning your mouth on hot drinks could be a thing of the past after an inventor launched a mug that keeps coffee and tea at a perfect temperature

The gadget has been created with a special layer of insulating material inside that draws away any excess heat from boiling hot drinks.

The container then uses this heat to keep the temperature at a comfortable level for up to three hours.

It is maintained at a temperature of 55°C, which enables someone to sip their drink without scalding themselves.

The technology inside the insulation of the device, called the Temperfect Mug, is made of a waxy substance which melts to preserve the right heat level.

The technology inside the insulation of 
the device, called the Temperfect Mug, is made of a waxy substance which
 melts to preserve the right heat level.

It is maintained at a temperature of 55°C, which enables someone to sip their drink without scalding themselves.

It was designed by Dean Verhoeven, who  created a prototype and launched the idea on crowdfunding website Kickstarter, where he has raised almost than £112,000 towards the manufacturing process.

The flasks are expected to go on sale for around £20 in July next year.

Mr Verhoeven, 53, an industrial designer from North Carolina, said: 'This project was born of my frustration with my coffee being too hot to drink after I made it.

'Then, it would get cold too quickly. I wanted it to be just right for a long time.

'I knew about the physics of phase change
 and realised it could be used to moderate my coffee's temperature 
simply and automatically.

The mug was designed by Dean Verhoeven (pictured), who became frustrated when every drink he made was too hot to drink for a while and then became cold quickly

'It's like a normal insulated mug, but it has an extra layer of insulation which extracts the excess heat from your coffee, stores it, and then uses it later to keep a drink just right.

'The Temperfect insulation is a phase change material which melts at the temperature you want your coffee to be at.

'It's a pure, wax-like substance which is perfectly safe and sealed in a stainless steel envelope.

'It needs no external power from batteries or cords, it just uses the heat of the coffee.

'The Temperfect Mug is best used with any drink that is too hot right after preparation, coffee, tea, soup, and cocoa for example.

'This mug has a hold temperature of about 55°C, and the coffee stays at a comfortable drinking temperature for about three hours.'
