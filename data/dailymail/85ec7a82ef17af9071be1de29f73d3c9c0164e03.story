Trout pout: Actress Leslie Ash had a botched lip filler injection by a doctor who used liquid silicone

A shocking report has already linked anti-wrinkle dermal  fillers to permanent blindness in three patients.

Now a leading cosmetic surgeon has claimed that there have been at least 30 cases of vision loss – and that the injections have also caused strokes in some patients.

‘These are not one-in-a-million instances,’ claims Dr Julian De Silva, a London-based plastic surgeon who specialises in  facial procedures.

Fillers are gel-like substances that are injected under the skin to add volume and give a plump, youthful appearance.

Alongside Botox, they represent a third of all non-surgical cosmetic procedures carried out in Britain.

The value of the UK cosmetic procedures market was £2.3 billion in 2010, and it is estimated that figure will grow  to £3.6 billion by 2015. Non-surgical procedures account for 75 per cent of the total.

Yet because fillers are legally classified as implants rather than drugs, they are not subject to the same regulations, and as such they can legally be injected by anyone – trained or otherwise.

The jabs are behind the much derided ‘trout pout’ phenomenon, where the gel is injected into the lips in order to enlarge the pout. However, the outcome can often look cartoonish and unsightly. Depending on the type of gel used, the result – no matter how garish – can be permanent.

In 2000, actress Leslie Ash famously suffered the ‘trout pout’ effect after having her lips injected with liquid silicone by a Venezuelan doctor.

Yet a poor cosmetic result is just a minor complication compared with the potential risks involved. ‘The problem comes when filler is accidentally injected into an artery,’ explains Dr De Silva.

‘This can lead to necrosis, or death of the skin tissue, and if they’re the arteries that supply oxygen to the back of the eye, this can lead to loss of vision. In a worst-case scenario, filler can even block oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in a stroke.’

Aside from the recent three cases of blindness, there were similar claims in 2012 – one report highlighted 32 cases,  while the second study revealed 12 incidents of spontaneous, permanent vision loss after  filler injections.

There have also been at least four reported instances of stroke, in which the blockage in the blood supply leads to tissue death and brain damage. These were the result of filler injections of the patients’ own fat taken from another part of their body, claims Dr De Silva.

Due to lack of regulation, under-reporting of complications is common, and manufacturers have no obligation to publish details of problems.

‘Because these side effects are under-reported, many practitioners don’t even know that there’s a risk of them happening, let alone have a plan of action for when they do,’ warns Dr De Silva.

In the UK, more than 120 fillers are licensed for use, yet in the United States only 21 can be used. In the UK in 2010, one filler, Novabel, manufactured by Merz Pharmaceuticals, was withdrawn just seven months after being licensed as patients experienced swelling and hard lumps forming beneath the skin.

Two years ago, Q-Med, the company behind the popular Restylane fillers, advised that another of its products, Macrolane, originally designed to be used in breast augmentation, should not be used in this way because it could hamper breast cancer diagnosis.

Both incidents fuelled fears that UK consumers were being used as guinea pigs.

Other doctors have raised concerns about delayed reactions to new-to-the-market fillers that can cause sudden pain and disfiguring swelling months after being injected.

Dr Darren McKeown, a cosmetic doctor who has clinics in London’s Harley Street and Glasgow, says: ‘As a trained medical professional, dealing with delayed inflammatory reactions is a challenging medical problem and I have serious concerns that less qualified practitioners might not have the requisite skills to cope, or that many may simply refuse to take responsibility for such a delayed side effect.’

Dr De Silva advises: ‘You should know before your procedure exactly what is going to be injected into your face and what the side effects could be.

‘I suggest using only hyaluronic acid-based fillers as these can be broken down if the patient has a reaction to them, and only having fillers that have been approved in the US because they have a good safety record.

‘And make sure you’re in the hands of a qualified medical professional with knowledge of the anatomy of the face.’
