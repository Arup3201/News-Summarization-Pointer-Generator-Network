Unlike on Earth, rolling down a window to air out a foul odor is not an option in the vacuum of space. So, for the last nearly 40 years, NASA has employed a master smeller to sniff out foul odors before they make life unbearable for our intrepid astronauts.

Meet George Aldrich of the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, who puts his highly-trained nose to everything from lab items to personal keepsakes that could bake in the atmosphere-free heat of space to become shockingly stinky.

'I actually use my sense of smell to help protect the astronauts from obnoxious odors in space,' Aldrich told odditycentral.com. 'I feel like I’m a bodyguard for the astronauts.'

Tougher than it looks: George Aldrich has been smelling things that NASA intends to take into space for nearly 40 years

There was even an instance in earlier days of space exploration when a Russian mission was actually aborted early because of an unbearable stench.

One reason objects are so stinky in space is the 90-minute night/day cycle, notes Wired.

Every hour and a half, the cabin is in very hot daylight that causes objects to off-gas potentially offensive fumes.

For some of his 'missions,' Aldrich and his team of sniffers basically bake samples of what's being taken into space in an oven for days to mimic space's harsh conditions.

Space stench: In space, even something as simple as a watch can turn from innocent object to malodorous menace in the 90-minute day to night cycle of outer space where temperatures cause serious off-gassing

Overwhelming: A Russian mission was once aborted a month before it was scheduled to end because a smell became so overwhelming to cosmonauts

Then they smell them. A sample of the air around the sample is sucked into a syringe and then plunged into a face mask.

'I’ll-take-the-bullet type thing, before you are actually subjected to it,' he said.

Even after all these years, Aldrich can still be surprised by how profoundly the conditions of space can turn a simple thing like newspaper ink into a malodorous menace.

'In my mind, I'm not really expecting them to be that bad,' he once told Wired. 'I guess what you worry about more than anything else is the stinky or pungent one, where it bites or burns up your nose. That's not pleasant.'

No one can hear you gag: Thanks to Aldrich's intrepid nose, missions on the space station can expect a fresh scent, or at least fresher than it could be. Space is notoriously stinky for astronauts, thanks to the enclosed atmosphere of the cabin, and even space itself is said to smell like scorched metal
