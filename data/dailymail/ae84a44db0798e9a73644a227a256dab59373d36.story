Natalie Bennett, the party leader, said the proposals would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at the General Election

The Green Party is calling for the Human Rights Act to be extended to include animals so that killers and kidnappers of whales, dolphins and apes will face the same jail sentences as human murderers. 

Its bizarre blueprint, which also included a tax on nappies and a better standard of living for rodents, was laid out at the party's annual conference in Liverpool this weekend. 

Likening the killing of sea creatures and monkeys to that of humans, its leader Natalie Bennett urged the law be changed to ensure anyone found guilty of such crimes against animals face a prison sentence. 

Addressing the conference she said the move would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at May's General Election. 

Her proposal would see the 1948 Human Rights Act extended to protect 'all sentient life forms'. 

Taxes on nappies, bans on horse racing and the creation of a fleet of hospital ships for the third world were also set to become official policy for the during a series of debates today.

The Greens also plan to form an alliance with the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru to force a minority Labour government to cut the defence budget.

Funding would be taken from  nuclear deterrence to be spent on foreign aid, increasing the budget to £16 billion a year, or one per cent of GDP.

On Sunday members were due to debate using the budget to build a fleet of hospital ships to provide worldwide humanitarian aid and support. 

The party also proposes new levies on manufacturers of disposable nappies.

Plans to extend the Human Rights act, which states that 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'  would mean anyone killing, torturing or 'kidnapping' dolphins, whales, apes and elephants would occur for equivalent crimes committed against humans.

Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will be joined by model Lily Cole on Sunday, said the proposals would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at the General Election.

Other plans include Forest Schools to giving youngsters a 'hands-on' appreciation of trees, bans on goods made in factories that do not comply with British health and safety standards, and splitting the jackpot on the National Lottery to create more frequent, smaller wins.

The conference is the Greens' decision making body, whereby policies approved by members become official party doctrine. An elected committee then decides which policies appear in the manifesto booklet.
