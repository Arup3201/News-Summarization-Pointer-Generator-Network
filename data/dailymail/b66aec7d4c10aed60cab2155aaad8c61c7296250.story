More than 100 Vietnamese mail-order brides have vanished after marrying Chinese bachelors from the same poor rural area.

Police are investigating the mass disappearance from Quzhou county, Handan, in the central province of Hebei, with reports saying that an 'organised ring' could be involved.

Poor bachelors from the area, which is mainly a farming community, had paid tens of thousands to a Vietnamese matchmaker who vanished along with the brides.

Runaway brides: Chinese police are seeking more than 100 Vietnamese mail-order brides who vanished after marrying bachelors from a poor rural area. It is thought a people smuggling ring may be involved

After decades of family planning policies and a traditional preference for boys, the male population now far outnumbers women in China, making it difficult to find a wife.

The area's bachelors were introduced to the women by Wu Meiyu, a Vietnamese bride who had lived in the area for 20 years, China Daily reported.

She received payments of more than 100,000 yuan ($16,000, £10,300) if the introductions were successful. She also disappeared with the women, it added.

The state-run newspaper cited an unnamed local official saying an organised ring may have been involved in the mass disappearance.

'With the advanced communication techniques of today, it's easy for all the brides to leave at the same time,' he told the newspaper.

The BBC, citing local media, reports that Ms Wu had earlier this year travelled around rural parts of Hebei drumming up customers for Vietnamese mail-order brides.

Then on November 20, after she'd made more than 100 matches, the wives are said to have told their new husbands they were having a meal with other Vietnamese brides. They then disappeared.

At least one bride has since returned, according to the BBC report citing Jinghua Daily. She said she had 'lost consciousness' after eating and woke up in a small house far from Quzhou.

Someone in the house was said to have told her she would be going somewhere else to 'find another husband'. Instead she left and returned to Quzhou where she filed a police report.

Buying wives from abroad has become increasingly common in some of China's poor rural areas, where a gender imbalance has developed due to a traditional preference for sons and the country's family planning policies.

Across China, 118 males are born for every 100 females, according to government statistics.

In some rural areas men can be expected to own a house, car and have considerable wealth before they can attract a Chinese bride, a cost the China Daily said could reach 400,000 yuan.

But with many unable to do so the trade in overseas brides, which is often linked to human trafficking, has grown in China.
