Karl Bestford will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison

A former slaughterman has been sentenced to life imprisonment after murdering his landlord and mutilating the body because he was asked about rent arrears.

Karl Bestford, 35, stabbed to death Simon Meech at his rented flat in Bensham, Gateshead.

He denied the charge but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court took two hours to deliver a guilty verdict yesterday.

The court heard how Bestford had argued with his wife on July 28 about his seven months of rent arrears and debts of £11,000 after two county court judgements.

Bestford had been due a visit from Mr Meech the next day to collect rent but the arrangement was changed 
to 9.30pm that night.

Bestford stabbed Mr Meech ten times in his living room with a kitchen knife and mutilated his body before fleeing the scene in his landlord’s car.

He travelled towards Carlisle, where his wife was staying, but pulled over, rang 999 and told police: 'I’ve slaughtered him, I don’t know what to do.'

He later rang police again and claimed Mr Meech had pulled a knife on him during
 a row. He said he had grabbed it off him and stabbed him.

He told police: 'I just saw red and I stabbed and stabbed and stabbed him.'

When police got to the scene, Mr 
Meech’s head was partially detached and his feet and calves had been 
wrapped in a bin liner while his legs were tied together with parcel 
tape.

PC Sarah Curry was 
among the officers who arrived at the flat. She said there was blood all over the flat, although it appeared attempts had been made to clean it up.

She told the court: 'I saw a
 man lying on his back on the kitchen floor.

'His lower legs from the knees down, including his feet, were covered in black bin bags which were wrapped round.'

Pathologist Dr Mark Egan told Newcastle Crown Court: 'Most of the wounds to the neck occurred after the heart had stopped beating.

'There
 was a clot in the blood vessels of the neck which raised the 
possibility at least one of the wounds was inflicted in life.

'It would have been apparent to the person whether he was alive or dead.'

He added Mr Meech had suffered stab wounds to his torso and face and other knife injuries to his arm, leg and palm.

The court heard Mr Meech, from Whickham, Gateshead, was a district manager for Blockbuster who had built up a portfolio of eight properties which he rented out.

He had a young son to his long-term partner and was described in 
court as a 'model landlord' by tenants in the other properties he rented
 out.

Bestford, who was working for a 
distribution company at the time, was renting one of those properties on
 Rayleigh Grove for £395 a month.

Mr Meech had allowed debt-ridden Bestford to get away without paying his rent for seven months and was owed £2,765.

Following the guilty verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Paul Young, who led the murder inquiry, said: 'This was a savage attack on a respectable member of the community who was simply going about his business.

'A dedicated team of detectives carried out a detailed investigation and this conviction means a dangerous and violent man will be off the streets for a considerable time.

'Our thoughts remain with Mr Meech’s family and friends who have shown great dignity throughout the investigation and I would like to thank them for their assistance.'

Mr Meech’s family issued a statement after the trial, paying tribute to him, which said: 'Simon was an incredible man, so deeply loved by all his family and friends.

'Our loss of him in July 2012 completely devastated our lives and left us utterly heartbroken.

'We would like to thank everyone who has, and continues to support us through this horrendous time, as well as Northumbria Police who have shown incredible professionalism and compassion towards the case and our family.

'We have been left with such a painful emptiness in our lives that anyone who knew Simon would know the extent of.

'Simon’s children have been robbed of the most wonderful father - to us this is far and above the most painful and tragic part of our loss.'

Sentencing Bestford to 22 years' imprisonment Mr Justice Coulson said: 'I reject completely that there was any threat of any kind from Mr Meech.

'You attempted to cut off one of his limbs. Worst of all you attempted to cut off his head. As someone who had worked in an abattoir, you must have known precisely what you were doing.

'His head was only attached to his body by the skin and the muscle at the back of his neck. Killing Mr Meech was senseless.'

The judge listed a number of aggravating factors.

Addressing the defendant he added: 'These included an element of planning, the use of a weapon, the fact a weapon was a large kitchen knife from your own kitchen, the suffering of Mr Meech when you stabbed him numerous times and the attempts to cover up what you had done.

'Stabbing him twice to the face and once to the back was in my view only explicable by an intention to kill your victim.'

'You will serve 22 years in prison before you are even considered for release.'
