Adnan Januzaj says Ryan Giggs is his 'godfather' at Manchester United and has revealed his pride in wearing the Welshman's legendary No 11 shirt.

Giggs - now Louis van Gaal's assistant at Old Trafford - called time on his playing career in May after 23 glittering years.

And teenage star Januzaj, who played in United's last-gasp draw against league leaders Chelsea, has been tapping up Giggs for advice on his burgeoning career.

'Ryan has helped me a lot and is like a godfather,' he said. 'He has told me to work hard on the training pitch and the rest is more personal. We talk about football a lot.'

The Belgian winger revealed he is mentored by Giggs - even to the point where Januzaj believes he could carry on playing as long as the evergreen United legend. 

'I learned a lot from him and the experience was great. He was such a good player to watch and is my favourite player of all time at United.' 

'Could I imagine playing at 40? Of course, if I am still fit. You never lose your quality, that’s something I learned from him.'

And when Giggs retired, Januzaj wasn’t slow in snapping up his mentor’s old shirt.

'I was really happy to get the number of such a legend and it was a really big deal for me,' Januzaj told the club's official website.

'I went to the office and they asked me if I wanted the shirt. I wasn’t going to say no! Straight away I said "of course" and I didn’t have to think about it. It was a "yes" straight away.'
