Kevin Spiolek, 52, a former professional darts player, has been cleared of groping a 14-year-old superfan 

A former professional darts player has spoken of his two-year 'nightmare' after being cleared of groping a 14-year-old superfan who came forward with allegations 13 years later.

Kevin Spiolek, 52, a former world number eight, was arrested in October 2012 for allegedly groping his 'number one fan' during the World Matchplay darts competition at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool, Lancashire, in 1999.

Mr Spiolek - one of only eight players to have beaten Phil 'The Power' Taylor at the World Darts Championships - was charged with four counts of indecent assault following the accusations. 

Now the father-of-two from Cambridge has spoken of his relief after being cleared of the charges.

Speaking from his home, Mr Spiolek said he and his family had been subject to a hate campaign since the allegations surfaced.

He also accused the woman of living in a 'fantasy world' driven by her love of celebrity - and even suggested that he wished he had never started playing the sport.

He said: 'The past two years have been absolutely awful - It's been a nightmare. I felt as though I was being treated as guilty until proven innocent.

'The person who made the accusations has had anonymity whereas my address and name have been all over the place. It shouldn't just be one way traffic. There should be protection for the accused until there is proof there.

'My daughter has been walking down the street and people have shouted abuse at her out of cars and my son and I have had our cars vandalised.

'My wife Claire and I have been married for 29 years and she has carried me through with her support. I would not have been able to cope without my wife.'

He added: 'I have often said to my wife that I wish I had never played darts. I had great times in my career and some very good memories but it all pales into insignificance because of everything we have been through in the past two years. At least now I can hold my head up high and move on.' 

After making the allegations, the woman said she did not go to police at the time as she was 'troubled and confused' about the encounter. She said she recorded an entry in her diary instead.

But she decided to come forward when she was 27, after being contacted on Facebook by a fellow darts fan who she used to see at competitions. She said the memories of the incident 'came back to her'.

After being charged in October 2012, Mr Spiolek faced two trials before a jury cleared him earlier this month.

Witnesses gave evidence during the trial to verify his movements on the day of the alleged incidents.

Speaking today, he added: 'Until I read this person's diary I had no idea she was an obsessed fan. Lots of other people had been mentioned there. It wasn't just me.

'I was in sheer shock when I heard the diary entries. It was complete and utter rubbish. She seemed to be in a fantasy world. I couldn't believe the courts were taking it seriously, there were so many other things that were made up in her diary entries.

'Her whole lifestyle seemed to revolve around being in the limelight and mixing with celebrities. My personal opinion is that she was saying whatever she thought would win her the case.' 

Preston Crown Court was told that, at the time of the alleged incident, Mr Spiolek was well-known and well-respected on the darts circuit.

He was one of the 16 players who created the Professional Darts Corporation and played in the first seven PDC World Championships.

The court heard how the teenage fan was from a family interested in professional darts. They would go to Blackpool to watch the Matchplay tournament every year, the court heard.

Mr Jeremy Lasker, prosecuting, said players would mingle with members of the public, pose for photos and give autographs. The same fans would return year after year and got to know the players, he said.

'The girl became a fan of this particular player. In fact, she may have regarded herself as his number one fan and we suggest the defendant himself may have been very well aware of that fact,' he said. 

The complainant had alleged she took a friend with her to the tournament where they sat on the balcony, overlooking the players and public in the auditorium.

She said that, when Mr Spiolek lost a match, he went up on the balcony, where the teenager join in with his commiserations.

She alleged Mr Spiolek then led her to a quiet room where he began to kiss her on the lips, undid her bra, fondled her breasts and asked if she was a virgin. He then asked whether she would like to have sex with him, she claimed.

It was further alleged there was a second sexual encounter between the pair at the evening session. She claimed Mr Spiolek asked again whether she wanted to have sex with him.

Mr Spiolek always denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the allegations as 'a load of garbage'.

He told police he remembered seeing her at the Winter Gardens and recalled received Good Luck cards. He added that she loved it when he said hello to her. 

Mr Spiolek added: 'Over the past two or three years there has been a lot of media attention on these types of cases.

'I have seen people on TV and how gaunt they look and the relief when it's all over and now I know how they feel.

'One person said the relief is not a celebration and that there are no winners - I really empathise with that feeling. When the jury found me innocent I just felt a sense of justice and relief.' 

Mr Spiolek, who is now a area sales representative for a stainless steel stockholder, added: 'When the police first put the charges to me I was shocked.

'I did know of the girl because she made herself known to me many years ago. I co-operated with the police, gave them all the information they needed and told the truth. When I found out I was going to court I was devastated.

'I knew all along I was innocent but there were times when I thought I might be convicted. I had never been in this position before, I didn't know much about how the criminal justice system and how it all worked.

'As a family we definitely curbed our visits out of our family home because every time we went out we were wondering what people were thinking. Sadly some we thought were friends hid away rather than support us.'
