Gamble: Punters can lose up to £300 a minute on betting terminals, according to the study published yesterday by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling

Betting terminals nicknamed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ are each making bookmakers more than £47,000 a year, according to a report.

Punters bet £8.6billion on the machines last year and lost £1.6billion – giving the bookies a profit margin of 19 per cent, it says.

When winning and losing bets are added up, a total of £46billion was wagered on the fixed odds betting terminals where customers can lose up to £300 a minute, according to the study published yesterday by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling.

The campaign group, which is demanding that the maximum stake be slashed to £2, also claims that bookmakers have targeted the machines at poorer areas, a claim hotly disputed by the gambling industry.

There are more than 34,000 FOBTs in the country and with total profits at £1.6billion each machine made £47,320. The report says that in the 55 most deprived boroughs of the country – representing the poorest quarter of the population – punters staked £13billion in 2,691 betting shops last year. They lost £470million of this money.

By contrast in the wealthiest quarter of councils customers staked £6.5billion over the same period in 1,258 bookmakers, losing only £231million of it. While punters using FOBTs lost an average of £1,096 last year in the poorest districts, those in the wealthiest boroughs lost an average of £519, it says.

The report also finds that while the number of betting shops has risen across the country by 288 to 9,343 over the last year, the number actually fell in the West Midlands, where bookmakers appear to make less money from the machines.

The average fixed odds gambler lost £776 last year in the West Midlands, but in the North East where punters lost £1,371, the number of betting shops soared by 8 per cent last year.

Adrian Parkinson, from the campaign group, said: ‘Bookmakers are not making as much money from some regions and in those they’ve cut the number of shops.’

With political pressure building for action against FOBTs, bookmakers last week issued a new code of conduct to curb the incidence of problem gambling from the high stakes machines.

Money making: There are more than 34,000 FOBTs in the country and with total profits at £1.6billion each machine made £47,320

The code, in force from this week, means FOBT punters in England and Wales can set their own limits and ensures they will receive on screen alerts after 30 minutes or if £250 is spent.

The Association of British Bookmakers brought in the code as it awaits a report into the dangers of FOBTs, which is widely expected to lead to a Government crackdown.

Last night the association hit back at the Campaign for Fairer Gambling report. Dirk Vennix, the association’s chief executive, said: ‘The CFFG allegation is total fantasy, and we can prove it. The gambling industry does not target deprived areas. It never has. It never will.

‘Like any retailer, we base our decisions on factors such as population density, footfall and rental costs. We don’t want problem gamblers in our shops.’

The association claimed the number of betting shops is actually declining. It said the CFFG’s figures were inflated because they also include some £2 stake gambling machines.
