A portable toilet delivery driver who posed as a dashing airline pilot to worm his way into the lives of unsuspecting women he later defrauded has been jailed.

Timothy Giles, 46, targeted victims on dating websites, telling them he was either a police officer, firefighter or commercial flyer with Australian airline Qantas.

Giles, from Blunsdon, Swindon, Wiltshire, embellished his lies with a photo of a pilot in uniform that looked like him and pictures of exotic holiday locations that he downloaded from the internet.

Exeter Magistrates’ Court heard women were taken in by his fake 'grandiose' lifestyle and entered into relationships with him, unaware he was a portable toilet delivery driver who was stealing money from his various dates.

One even allowed Giles to move into her home in a Devon village, and become a 'father figure' to her two young children, the court was told.

She was persuaded into lending him £320 after Giles claimed he had 'fallen into difficulties' despite working for Qantas - believing his position meant he could pay it back.

Police arrested Giles at her home on on December 30 last year after it emerged he had used his delivery firm employer’s fuel fob to fill his Land Rover Discovery with £978.65 of fuel.

He also failed to pay Children’s Hospice South West £65 in sponsorship for completing a cycle ride for the charity.

District Judge Stephen Nicholls told Giles his actions had devastated his victims and required an immediate prison sentence of 84 days.

Giles, who admitted six counts of fraud by false representation, one of theft and one of breaching bail conditions, was ordered to repay his victims £785.

'I accept you were somebody who was facing a difficult set of circumstances, having some time ago found yourself at the end of a long marriage and in a situation where you were out of work,' the judge said.

'You effectively created havoc amongst everybody else that you came into contact with. You purported to be someone that you were not.

'You pretended that you were a police officer. You told one woman that you were an airline pilot.

'You knew in putting forward these false set of circumstances the effect this was having on the people who you were committing the offences against.'

Giles first pretended to be a firefighter to attract one woman, who helped him raise money for Children’s Hospice South West through a cycle ride in April 2013.

Her friends, family and work colleagues sponsored Giles for the ride, which he completed, but he failed to hand the money to the charity.

In July last year, Giles attracted another woman through a dating profile picture of a police officer with an automatic weapon strapped across him.

He described himself as an armed response officer for Devon and Cornwall police and, after gaining the woman’s trust, used her bank card details to pay his £225.45 phone bill.

Giles was arrested in September 2013 and handed a conditional discharge for the offence at Taunton Deane Magistrates’ Court after repaying the money.

But in October 2013, he met another woman through the same dating website, this time purporting to be a Qantas pilot.

Christopher Bittlestone, prosecuting, said: 'She was in a vulnerable position, she was a lady with two small children.

'He made certain representation to her that he was an airline pilot working for Qantas who had fallen into difficulty, with all sorts of excuses given to her about why he was short of cash.'

The woman, who Giles moved in with, agreed to loan him £120 on October 29 and a further £200 on December 23.

'Her world came crashing down on December 30 when the police eventually caught up with Mr Giles,' Mr Bittlestone said.

'She came to realise very shortly that everything she had been told about him was simply a lie.'

Between August and September of last year, Giles used his employer’s fuel fob to fill his Land Rover with £978.65 of fuel, the court heard.

Giles had been given the fob as part of his job picking up portable toilets from building sites but it was not for personal use. 

Nicholas Bradley, representing Giles, said his client was in a new relationship and had found employment.

Ruling: Giles, who admitted six counts of fraud by false representation, one of theft and one of breaching bail conditions, was ordered to repay his victims £785 by a district judge at Exeter Magistrates' Court

'He is in a place in terms of his life to go forward to the future back on the same side of the path that he was on previously,' Mr Bradley said.

'He is a man who is capable of working and supporting others, capable of contributing to society rather than damaging it.'

He said his client, save for the conditional discharge last year, had only one previous offence from 1990.

Giles looked shaken as he was led to the cells.

Speaking after Giles’ conviction, his most recent victim said: 'His story was that he was an airline pilot working for Qantas and had been doing so for 10 years.

'He said his parents lived in Australia where he used to work but he had moved to the company’s English base.

'He then moved to Devon and would stay at mine a lot and leave at silly o’clock to say he was driving back to Heathrow. I now know he was going to see another woman.

'He had details about his job, parents, house and past life. He had a complete life mapped out but it was all just a fabricated mess.

'He would send me photos of where he was in the world. He would text me his ‘current view’ of a hotel or beach in the Indian ocean.

'But it was all just downloaded off the internet - just like the photo he initially sent me in a pilot’s uniform.

'I never suspected anything - he seemed so genuine. He had an answer for anything and everything.'
