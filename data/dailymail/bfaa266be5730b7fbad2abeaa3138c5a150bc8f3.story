Roma vs Manchester City (Stadio Olimpico)

Team news 

Roma forwards Gervinho and Miralem Pjanic are expected to play despite minor injuries.

Rudi Garcia has no concerns about the state of mind of midfielder Daniele de Rossi.

De Rossi was sent off in Saturday's draw against Sassuolo, days after reports emerged claiming his ex-wife Tamara Pisnoli - to whom he was married from 2006-09 - had been arrested as part of an investigation into an alleged kidnapping scandal.

Garcia said: 'Daniele is fine. We won't have him for the Genoa game, but he's a very important player, a great champion and a crucial figure in the dressing room.

'He's played over 100 times for Italy, he's a champion both on the field and in life.'

Manchester City

Team news 

City captain Vincent Kompany, playmaker David Silva and striker Stevan Jovetic could all be back in contention for Wednesday's Champions League Group E decider at Roma.

The trio all trained in Manchester prior to the squad's departure for Italy on Tuesday. Defender Kompany has missed two games with a hamstring injury while Silva has not featured since October because of a knee problem. Jovetic (hamstring) was rested last weekend as a precaution.

Their return would be welcomed after top striker Sergio Aguero suffered a knee injury last weekend while midfielder Yaya Toure is suspended.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Mangala, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Silva, Nasri, Navas, Milner, Fernando, Fernandinho, Lampard, Jovetic, Dzeko, Pozo, Glendon.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Roma would qualify for the Champions League last 16 for the first time in four seasons with a win. Even a draw would be enough if CSKA also draw with Bayern Munich. A goalless draw would be enough if CSKA don't win against Bayern.

In the only group with all its members able to qualify for the last 16, City’s fate depends on the CSKA result.

If Manuel Pellegrini’s side lose against Roma, both City and CSKA will be out of the Champions League this season.

Gervinho has the joint-highest shooting accuracy among players with more than five attempts at target (87.5 per cent, alongside Benzema).

Sergio Agüero has scored five goals in the Champions League this season, just one goal behind his personal record in a single season set last term.

Roma have won five of their last seven European home games against English opposition (D1 L1).

Manchester City have never won a European game away from home against an Italian side (D2 L2).

Roma have not been able to score more than one goal in the Champions League this season since MD1 against CSKA Moscow (5-1).

That game was Roma’s only CL win in their last eight games (D3 L4).

With their victory over Bayern Munich in the last game (3-2), the Citizens ended a run of six CL games without a win (D2 L4), their worst such run in the competition.
