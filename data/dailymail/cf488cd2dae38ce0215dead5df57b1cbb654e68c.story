Online dating is the best way for hopeful singletons to find love than in the modern world.

But one controversial dating site has taken the selection process to a whole new level by allowing its users to filter out members looking for romance according to their body type ... for a price.

Popular U.S. dating site, OkCupid.com lets online daters pay $4.95 (£3) to hide anyone who classes themselves 'curvy', 'skinny', 'thin', 'jacked' or 'used up' among other body types.

'While it will probably be common knowledge to many internet dating aficionados, OkCupid’s premium search options are eyebrow-raising in an era of tolerance and political correctness,' writes Kermalmag.com journalist James Cook, who spotted the function.

OkCupid also allows its 'A-list members' - who pay a monthly subscription fee of between $4.49 and $9.95 - to filter people by both looks and figure.

Would YOU filter out people of certain body types and levels of attractiveness to find your perfect match online? One dating site lets you do just that

Select your type: A drop down menu allows users to filter matches by their body type, essentially allowing them to hide overweight people

You can select people in a drop-down menu who have body types such as 'thin', 'skinny', 'overweight and 'curvy'.

You can also filter people based on their attractiveness rating, as ranked by other users.

An anonymous OkCupid user added: 'I've been using OkCupid for just over a year now, and it's pretty disconcerting to think men have the ability to filter me out by my body type.

'However, the function is still placing a lot of trust in people's accurate description of themselves. I myself have been lucky that every guy I've met from the site has looked their pictures, but others I know have had some horrible surprises when they meet in person.

A-listers: Premium users, who pay to upgrade their account, are allowed to filter out people based on their appearance rating, too

'Equally the search for "only five star" rated people will not always yield supermodel results, as people, or at least myself, occasionally rate people on the quality of their profile and how they answer the site's questions, rather than purely their aesthetics.

'Beauty, after all, is supposed to be in the eye of the beholder.

'Ultimately, what freaks me out the most is the kind of person that would pay to exercise that degree of control over their results. To me, that suggests that the weird and wonderful world of online dating might not be for you.'

Rowan Pelling added: 'OkCupid is clearly the Abercrombie & Fitch of dating sites, allowing curvy types to be screened out of supposed A-List members searches.

'All I can say is that you're pretty dumb and Z-list if you allow screening so prejudiced that some brainless body-fascist can screen out all plus-size suitors: goodbye Marilyn Monroe, Sophie Dahl, Lena Dunham, Gerard Depardieu, James Corden, Seth Rogen.

'And, you know what? I have a strong feeling that all of those people would be a hundred times better (and funnier) in bed than your average waif. I guess this is a perfect example of be careful what you wish for: do you really want to spend the rest of your life with an exercise bore who exists on seaweed smoothies?'
