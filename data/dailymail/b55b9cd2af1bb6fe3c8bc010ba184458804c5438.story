At first glance, these incredible bags look like they might have jumped straight out of the pages of a Japanese comic book.

But looking again, you’ll realise that these creations by Taipei-based designers Chay Su and Rika Lin are in fact real-life bags, made to resemble hand-drawn illustrations.

The anime-inspired ‘JumpFromPaper’ creations sell online from £37 to £56 - plus a UK postage charge of £17 - and have colourful names such as 'tropical fish', 'afternoon tea' and 'travel fever'.

The Taipei duo came up with the product after sketching their dream designer bag and trying to bring it to life.

They eventually decided on the colourful designs with cartoon outlines.

‘Cartoon-like outlines and bright and cheerful colours add a brisk yet funky flavour,’ a spokesman for the firm said.

‘And despite the slim appearance, each JumpFromPaper bag has a roomy interior to accommodate personal belongings and even iPad tablets.

Practical: The bags, said to be washable with warm water and diluted detergent, first went on sale last week

Well received: Reviews have said the anime-inspired bags have a 'rigid construction and rugged stitching'

Innovative: The firm said the creations take 'handbag design on a new journey, ready to twist people’s view'

One of the bags, the 'Play Hooky', was said in a review to be less than an inch deep when collapsed, but its size could be tripled with a zip that ran along the outside.

Reviews have said the bags have a ‘rigid construction and rugged stitching’. Some also come with an adjustable shoulder strap.

The bags, which are said to be washable with warm water and diluted detergent, went on sale last week.
