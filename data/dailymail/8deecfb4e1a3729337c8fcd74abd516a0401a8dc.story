Roy Hodgson is backing Wayne Rooney to go on to break Peter Shilton’s England caps record as he prepares to make his 100th appearance against Slovenia a week on Saturday.

The Manchester United striker will earn his golden cap in the Euro 2016 qualifier, taking him to just 25 appearances short of the mark set by the goalkeeper.

At 29, time could be against Rooney but Hodgson is convinced Shilton’s record is set to fall.

England captain Wayne Rooney will win his 100th cap against Slovenia next week

Rooney could go on to become England's most capped player ever according to manager Roy Hodgson

The Manchester United striker made his debut in 2003 at the age of 17, in a friendly against Australia

The England manager said: ‘I think he could (do it). We play on average 10 games a year and in two years’ time he will be 30 or 31. That is no age for a player today.

‘I would say Peter Shilton’s record is in danger. Generally the record for caps It is always held by a goalkeeper so it will be some achievement if a forward can take the record. It would be a great achievement and I would back him to do it.’

Rooney has scored 43 times for his country in the past 11 years since his debut

The forward, England captain since last summer's World Cup, has played in the tournament three times

Hodgson has handed Theo Walcott his first England call for a year and did not rule out giving the Arsenal winger some playing time as he returns from a serious knee injury.

Saido Berahino has also been rewarded for his excellent form at West Brom, with Daniel Sturridge absent with a calf injury.

Hodgson’s relationship with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has drawn much scrutiny over the Raheem Sterling ‘fatigue’ affair.

Hodgson said: ‘Daniel Strurridge was never a realistic possibility as he is still recovering from his calf injury he picked up, which is unfortunate. We were hoping of course to get him back but it hasn’t worked out. 

Peter Shilton is currently England's record cap holder, having played 125 times for his country

Shilton's international career lasted 20 years, but Hodgson believes Rooney can pass his cap record

'Our medical staff have had contact and I left a message for Brendan. The message was pretty obvious that he is not fit. Brendan has not rung back to counter that he actually is fit.’

Asked when he left the message, Hodgson said: ‘Only last night I left a message, basically to tell him that when I name the squad that Daniel Sturridge is unfit. 

'There was no need to call me back, just to let him know that I understood Daniel wasn’t fit for this game so if I got any questions today the answers I give would be ones he understands and be happy with.’

Daniel Sturridge is close to a Liverpool return, but is still not fit enough to play for England yet

Hodgson defended his decision to reveal that Raheem Sterling missed an England game because he was tired

On the back of the issues surrounding Sterling’s absence from the qualifier in Estonia, Hodgson insisted his relationship with the forward is good.

Hodgson said: ‘I speak to Raheem all the time. As far as I am concerned that chapter, which was an unfortunate one, is over. I have nothing to say or add.

‘We will both probably learn from it though I don’t understand how it is mistake to tell the truth when asked why you have not chosen a player.’

Walcott has joined the England squad with Arsene Wenger’s blessing. Hodgson did not rule out using him against Slovenia or Scotland, though his role is likely to be limited to fitness work. 

Theo Walcott has returned to the England squad, despite only making one substitute appearance this season

Walcott has been out since January, when he injured his knee in an FA Cup tie against Tottenham

Hodgson said: ‘Theo over the past two and a half years has been important. He is continuing with a fitness plan that we will follow while he is with us.

‘We have given the club that guarantee and Arsene is happy for us to take him. I spoke to Theo on Wednesday and said how pleased I was. I can’t guarantee him minutes but that is no guarantee that he won’t get minutes. If he is feeling fit and we can use him we will.’ 

Hodgson also explained that Berahino's inclusion, for the first time at senior level, was based on his form in the Premier League and for Gareth Southgate's Under 21 side, and suggested the West Brom striker will get game time. 

'The reasons are quite obvious, not only because he’s done so well for his club but for the Under 21s team too.

Saido Berahino has earned his first senior call-up, on the back of excellent form for the U21 side

Berahino has also been in good goalscoring form for his club, scoring seven Premier League goals

'He’s been in good form and he has been in our mind since the last get-together. The Under 21s only have a friendly so I saw no reason not to bring him in now.

'There is no point bringing these players in if they don’t have a chance to play. He will hope to but he faces competition from the other strikers too.'
