Manuel Pellegrini will decide who he will axe from Manchester City's Champions League squad to make way for new man Wilfried Bony on Tuesday.

Up until recently it was assumed that stand in right back Bacary Sagna would be the automatic choice to drop out as the club submit their 21-man squad to Uefa.

But a sterling performance in the 1-1 draw at Chelsea has improved the Frenchman's chances of dodging a bullet.

Manuel Pellegrini must decide who will drop out of his Manchester City squad to accommodate Wilfried Bony 

Man City right back Bacary Sagna is among the possible candidates who could lose his European spot

Manchester City have had their 2014-15 Champions League squad cut from 25 players to 21 after breaching financial Fair Play rules 

Attention has now shifted to fringe strike pair Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko.

In recent times Montengro international Jovetic has had more game time than the big Bosnian, who was linked with a £12million deadline day switch to Fenerbahce which failed to materialise.

None of City's four 'homegrown' players, Joe Hart, James Milner, Frank Lampard or Gael Clichy will be considered along with 'club-trained' Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata as the Etihad side have to meet their quota.

Dzeko has struggled this season and is unlikely to be amused with a lack of playing time.

Other options for Pellegrini include dropping stand-in goalkeeper Willy Caballero although that is unlikely.

If Sagna was to miss out, Milner could fill in as a back-up to Pablo Zabaleta.

Outsiders for the chop include Jesus Navas and Aleksandar Kolarov but both are considered unlikely options along with the prospect of leaving Bony out himself as he finds his feet following his move from Swansea City.

Stevan Jovetic or Edin Dzeko are now the front-runners to lose their spot to new City team-mate Bony
