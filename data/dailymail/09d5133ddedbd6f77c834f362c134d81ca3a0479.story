Money flowed, jazz music rang out, and fashionable young women in 1920s London, Paris and New York set aside behaviour previously deemed 'appropriate' in favour of high spirits, short skirts, hedonism and social liberation.

These giddy, creative, enthusiastic women of the Roaring Twenties' were named 'flappers' because of their effervescent personalities. They were writers, actresses, painters, society heiresses, and they were a new breed of women typified by newly bobbed hair, thick make-up and predilections for smoking, drinking, dancing the Charleston... and then some.

As Baz Luhrmann's new cinematic remake of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby prepares for release, global interest in the era is piquing.

And a new book now lifts the lid on the most infamous of these flapper women - from Fitzgerald's American wife Zelda and US actress Tallulah Bankhead, to Britain's high society heiresses Diana Cooper and Nancy Cunard - revealing them as bawdy souls with penchants for cocaine, lesbian affairs and all-night sex sessions.

'My father warned me about men and booze, but he never mentioned a word about women and cocaine': Tallulah Bankhead in 'Her Cardboard Lover', (1903-68)

Flappers: Six Women Of A Dangerous Generation by Judith Mackrell follows the lives of a handful of these international women who, between them, exemplified the daring nature and extreme depths of their generation's spirit.

Zelda, the colourful American wife of Gatsby author Scott Fitzgerald; American dancer Josephine Baker; Paris-based Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka; American actress Tallulah Bankhead and English aristocrats Diana Cooper and Nancy Cunard each feature in chapters dedicated to their lives.

The book divulges intimate details of Tallulah's various lesbian experiments and affairs with young female admirers and more mature women alike, and describes how difficult it was to feel bad about using cocaine to lift the spirit when the substance was so easy to acquire.

The jazz-age actress, who starved determinedly to achieve her waifish look, frequently quipped a phrase by which she and so many of her peers lived by: 'My father warned me about men and booze, but he never mentioned a word about women and cocaine.'

Author Judith Mackrell, an acclaimed dance critic, reveals Tamara de Lempicka to be a lesbian, free to discover the possibilities of her motivations in the liberal age of the Twenties, and especially in Paris.

The glamorous artist of Polish origin would snort cocaine from a silver teaspoon allowing her to stay up all night having sex or painting.

In a heady mix of epicureanism and dismay, Mackrell writes of how Nancy Cunard's penchant for French affairs acted as remedy for despair at life's tragedies, and of Zelda Fitzgerald's heavy alcohol consumption and taste for morphine.

In an era of soaring stock markets, 
consumer expansion, urbanization and fast travel, women were reimagining
 both the small detail and the large ambitions of their lives.

For them, the pursuit of experience was not just about dancing and wearing fashionable clothes.

They
 made themselves prominent among the artists, icons and heroines of 
their age, pursuing experience in ways that their others could never 
have imagined, seeing to define what it was to be young and a woman in 
an age where the smashing of old certainties had thrown the world wide 
open.

Talented, reckless 
and wilful, with personalities that transcended their class and 
background, they re-wrote their destinies in remarkable, fascinating and
 tragic ways.
