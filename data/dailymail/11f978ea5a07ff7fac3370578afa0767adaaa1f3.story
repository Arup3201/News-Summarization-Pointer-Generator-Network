It takes dedication to follow in the footsteps of your hero - particularly if that hero happens to be global explorer and adventurer Sir Francis Drake.

But after 30 years travelling thousands of miles and at an estimated cost of Â£100,000, Michael Turner says he has re-traced almost every journey taken by the famous Elizabethan.

The 57-year-old teacher has visited 42 countries over three decades since becoming obsessed with Drake as a schoolboy.

Adventure: Michael Turner has spent his adult life re-tracing the journey's of Sir Francis Drake all over the globe

He claims to have ticked off 98 per 
cent of the destinations reached by Drake in the 16th century and has 
just two trips left to complete his mission - the Western Sahara and 
Cape Horn off South America.

Since the start of his adventures, Mr 
Turner has been jailed in Guatemala, almost lost his ear to a knife 
attack in Colombia, hacked through jungles and dived 170 feet off the 
coast of Panama in a bid to see Drake's final resting place - his 
lead-lined coffin.

The supply teacher said: 'I have certainly had some experiences.'

In February Mr Turner visited Panama 
for the tenth time where he cut his way along a 16th-century trail to 
reach the ruined settlement deep in the heart of the rainforest which 
Drake raided in 1571.

He said: 'We had to deal with mud, 
sweat, cuts, exhaustion, thirst, blisters, bruised toes, mosquitoes, 
poisonous vipers and scorpions.

'The crowning glory was to traverse a 
steeply undulating ridge with no water supplies to reach the Cerro 
Brewster Mountain from where Drake saw the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

'This was a pivotal moment in English 
history when Drake was inspired to sail a ship into the Pacific Ocean 
which led to him circumnavigating the world.'

He continued: 'This became the most 
famous voyage in English history and stimulated England to beat the 
Spanish Armada of 1588 and to become the world's most powerful navy.

'This was the first expedition to identify this Drake landmark and to visit it since February 1572.'

Despite Drake being a famous sailor, 
Mr Turner tackles most of his adventures on foot, flying into ports and 
islands Drake visited before trekking through jungles or along 
coastlines to stand on the very spot his hero visited 440 years ago.

He has just two trips left to tackle, but is hoping for government help and extra funds to finally tick them off his list.

Sir Francis Drake was the first Briton
 to circumnavigate the world and second-in-command of the English fleet 
against the Spanish Armada in 1588.

It is said that prior to the battle he
 was playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe, and when warned of the 
enemy's approach declared there was plenty of time to finish the game 
and still beat the Spaniards.

Mr Turner, who lives in Burnham-on-Sea
 in Somerset, and teaches Humanities and P.E. tried to visit Cape Bouj 
Dour and Cape Barbas off the coast of the Western Sahara in 2008, but 
nobody was willing to take him out on a boat without an official letter 
from the Moroccan government. He is currently appealing to his MP for 
help.

His final trip will be to Cape Horn - the southernmost headland of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of southern Chile.

Mr Turner, who is not married, became 
obsessed with the 16th century sea captain at the age of eight when he 
first heard about his explorations at school.

He explained: 'I learned of a 
different Drake story every year and became mesmerised by one man's life
 - his innovative adventures with fairy-tale endings.

'Then I read his biographies as a teenager and when I was 24 I saw Drake's portrait in Vera Cruz.

'I was thrilled to be on the same piece of turf as him all those miles from home.

'It was then I decided to focus on 
Drake and become an expert and it was a decision that would take me to 
42 different countries.'
