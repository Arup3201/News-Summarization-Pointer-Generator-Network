Tragic: David James has died in hospital. His family had been battling against a hospital trust's attempt to withdraw treatment, saying he still 'enjoyed life'

A grandfather has died just ten days after his family lost a legal battle that allowed his hospital to withhold treatment if his condition deteriorated.

David James, 68, walked into his local hospital last May with suspected constipation but never left after developing hospital acquired pneumonia and blood poisoning.

Within weeks he was in intensive care and was left unable to speak or breathe unaided.

Last summer the hospital trust - which cannot be named for legal reasons - launched a rare legal action seeking permission to withdraw potentially life-saving treatment from Mr James.

His appalled family insisted Mr James, a professional musician, still enjoyed life and was not ready to die leading to a judge rejected the hospital trust's application

But the trust won an appeal against the decision days before Christmas meaning treatment could be withheld from Mr James if his condition deteriorated.

His daughter Julie, 48, described the ruling as 'legalised murder'.

Little more than a week later Mr James' condition deteriorated and he died in the early hours of New Year's Eve with his family saying they begged staff to do more to help.

Julie said: 'When the nurse told us he was going I just got hold of him and held him tight. I told him we would keep on fighting for him.

'We are all in total shock. It's very hard to take in and my mum is distraught.

'Dad has bounced back so many times that it's hard to accept that it's not going to happen now.

'Even now I feel I should be getting ready to go to hospital to see him. It is hard to believe that this happened to a man who came into hospital for constipation a few months ago.'

Mr James's condition deteriorated over the weekend and by Sunday his blood pressure was very low and his kidneys had started to fail.

He was given medicine to tackle the low blood pressure but Julie says their calls for him to be given kidney dialysis were rejected.

Julie says the hospital told her dialysis would be 'futile' and would have subjected her father to 'unnecessary distress'.

Eventually Mr James went into cardiac 
arrest on the morning of New Year's Eve and in accordance with the legal
judgement hospital staff did not give CPR.

When Mr James's heart failed last August staff did give CPR and he made a good recovery.

Mr James died with his wife of 50 years May, 76, Julie and son Paul, 37, at his bedside.

Julie added: 'This is a direct 
consequence of the court judgement ten days ago. I think they have 
effectively been slowly withdrawing treatment ever since.

'As far as the family are concerned my
dad has been a victim of neglect from day one - and ever since the 
court reversed his decision he was effectively sentenced to death.

'We are just all devastated that it happened so quickly.'

The case of Mr James further illustrates the furore surrounding the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP).

Some relatives argue the controversial palliative care system is a way for medical staff to kill off the terminally ill and old.

The courts accepted a claim by the 
hospital that they were not invoking LCP in Mr James's case but his 
family are adamant in their belief he was secretly placed in the 
Pathway.

Julie added: 'After the latest court hearing doctors told us they would negotiate with us when it came to on-going treatment.

'We didn't like that word - this is a human life we are talking about, not buying a new car.

'We knew it was futile too, because ultimately no-one can tell a doctor what to do and what not to do.'

Mr James had played guitar on the 1974
hit who Do you Think you are by Candlewick Green and had also played 
alongside the likes of Shirley Bassey and the Beatles.

He was diagnosed with bowel cancer 11 
years ago and given just six months to live but made a full recovery 
after chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.

He enjoyed good health until last May when he was admitted to his local hospital with suspected constipation.

The hospital wanted to give him a CT scan which, as it was a Bank Holiday, could not take place for a few days.

When his wife returned the following day she was told he had got hospital acquired pneumonia.

His condition worsened as he also 
developed a water infection and septicaemia before being admitted to 
intensive care three weeks later.

He then spent the rest of his life on a
ventilator and suffered a stroke and cardiac arrest while his court 
case was still underway.

But his family have refuted the hospital's claims that he suffered 'multiple organ failure' several times.

Son Paul said: 'He fought and fought until the very end. And we will keep fighting to get justice for him.'

It is understood all treatment given 
to Mr James was in line with the court ruling, which concluded that CPR 
was not in Mr James' best interests if his condition deteriorated.

A hospital spokesman said: 'We've had 
close communication with Mr James' family throughout this process and if
there are any issues they would like to discuss further we'd welcome 
that.

'Our thoughts and condolences are with
the family at this difficult time.' 'Our thoughts and condolences are 
with the family at this difficult time.'
