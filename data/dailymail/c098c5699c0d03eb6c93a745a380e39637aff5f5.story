Apple's eagerly anticipated new smartphone, the iPhone 5S, could be 31 percent faster than the current iPhone 5 model, according to rumours.

Speculation about the phone's new features includes a fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone, a slow motion camera - and now a faster chip.

According to a TV anchor, the iPhone 5S will include a fast A7 processor to make the phone noticeably faster than the latest model currently available.

Clayton Morris of Fox News tweeted: 'Sources are telling me the new iPhone's A7 chip is running at about 31% faster than A6. I’m hearing it’s very fast.'

According to 9to5Mac Apple is testing 64-bit A7 processors in its prototypes, which would give the phone much better performance per watt and let it handle animated graphics more smoothly.

If the company can deliver a faster smartphone, it will once again put them on a level pegging with Samsung's popular high-end smartphones.

Experts have speculated that the same processor will probably be included in the next iPad.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, recently told the news site that the transition to the new, faster processor will probably happen soon.

If the company can deliver a faster smartphone, it will once again put them on a level pegging with Samsung's popular high-end smartphones. The phone is also rumoured to boast a fingerprint sensor to identify the owner, a slow-motion camera with dual flash and could even be gold-coloured (like this treated iPhone 5)

However, Mashable reported many people believe that 
while the chips are rumoured to be in testing, there is no solid 
evidence to suggest that they will be launched this year.

If not, many Apple fans hope a 64-bit A8 processor will be launched early in 2014.

Insiders believe the new phone - along with a low-cost handset dubbed the iPhone C - will be unveiled next month with the event rumoured to be taking place on September 10.

Mr Morris said: 'I’ve also heard there’s a separate chip devoted to motion tracking. Should be an interesting camera upgrade.'

Rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera with code discovered in iOS 7 suggesting that phones 
running the software will be able to record video at a rate of 120 
frames-per-second (FPS) rather than around 30 frames per second.

The high-end handset is also predicted to have a sensor that can identify the owner by his or her fingerprints.

Code uncovered describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb.

A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'.
