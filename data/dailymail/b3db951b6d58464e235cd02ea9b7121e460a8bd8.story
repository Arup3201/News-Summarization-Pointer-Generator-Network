The Liverpool squad may be about to face arguably their most important test of the season against Manchester United, but that didn't stop Brendan Rodgers' side from enjoying some star gazing on Friday morning.

The likes of Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho donned pairs of special sunglasses in a bid to catch a glimpse of Friday's solar eclipse outside Liverpool's Melwood training ground.

The near-total eclipse over Britain was seen by millions across the country, but it looked as the Fabio Borini and Lucas Leiva couldn't quite make out the phenomenon.

The Reds players seemed to be in high spirits ahead of Sunday's clash at Anfield and Rodgers looks set to be able to call upon a full compliment of players. 

Leiva's fitness will be assessed as the Brazil international continues to recover from a groin problem sustained six weeks ago but may not be ready to go straight into the squad.

Striker Mario Balotelli has recovered from the bout of illness which saw him miss Monday's win at Swansea.
