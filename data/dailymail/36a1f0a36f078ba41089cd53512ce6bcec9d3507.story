Thousands of revellers at the Isle of Wight Festival were today being warned to firmly ‘peg down their tents’ by the Met Office as potential torrential rain threatens to turn the entire site into a mudbath.

Despite the expected poor weather, music fans were still determined to enjoy the festival which will see Bon Jovi, The Killers and The Stone Roses headlining over the weekend.

Many made the most of a brief spell of sunshine today, wearing sunglasses and summer clothes, as temperatures peaked at 16C.

Festival-goers have been promised by 
the organisers that there will not be a repeat of last year's scenes of 
chaos when heavy rainfall turned the car parks into mudbaths.

The traffic queues even led to 
ferries becoming stranded in the Solent because they were unable to 
unload any more vehicles on to the island.

John Giddings, promoter of the 
festival, which is now in its 12th year, has invested in larger car 
parking fields with asphalted entrances to help prevent a recurrence.

Among those heading across from 
Portsmouth to the island were Tazz McCarthy, 22, and Bronia Burlinska, 
21, both from north London, who are returning to the festival for the 
second year.Miss McCarthy 
said: 'I'm so looking forward to it. The atmosphere at the Isle of Wight
Festival is amazing. It's the second time we've been to it and I'm 
still wearing my wristband from last year.'

Adding that the poor weather last 
year and the heavy winds hitting the island today had not put her off, 
she said: 'Last year, I saw our tent lopsided with a couple of bags on 
it and said "I feel sorry for whoever's tent that is" and then realised 
it was ours.'

Clare Thornhill, 26, from Preston, 
Lancashire, who was heading across with friends Charlotte Gillett, 22, 
and Lucy Judge, 23, said: 'We're used to the bad weather. We're from up 
north, this is nothing to what we get at home.'

Martin Payne, 36, from Helston, Cornwall, was arriving with 13 friends to celebrate his stag do.Pushing
a trolley with a dozen crates of beer and cider, he said: 'We're going 
to have four days of drinking and cavorting, well, not too much 
cavorting. The wedding's not until September so I've plenty of time to recover.'

As
well as the practical improvements, Mr Giddings has created new 
attractions away from the main stages, with additions including a 
bohemian wood, cabaret club, extended dance tent and a bigger beach.

And
festival-goers will also be able to experience art in action with a 
piece of stone the size of a Stonehenge slab being transformed into a 
sculpture during the weekend.

The
luxury side of the festival has also expanded, with hot tubs and barrel
saunas being available in a new spa area, and in the campsite, 
Tangerine Fields is providing hundreds of campers with pre-pitched tents
with extra luxuries such as a pamper parlour and phone-charging.

A
spokesman for the company, which has been operating for 10 years, said: 'All of Tangerine Fields' tents are re-used until they can't stay up 
late any more, then their good bits are taken and passed on to younger 
models, getting the maximum use out of everything before it is retired.

'All
of the left-over sleeping bags are donated to various local and 
national charities including Oxfam and Crisis and His Church and so far 
over 40,000 homeless people, Scout groups and hostels have directly 
benefited from Tangerine Fields and the kindness of their guests.'

Some
Bon Jovi fans have been disappointed that guitarist Richie Sambora will
not be performing after he recently quit the group's North American 
tour.

Other acts performing at
the festival, which runs until Sunday at Seaclose Park, Newport, 
include Paul Weller, Emeli Sande, Jake Bugg, Everything Everything, 
Blondie, Imagine Dragons, Ellie Goulding, Rizzle Kicks and Republica.

Police will be patrolling the festival site and have helped develop traffic plans to prevent a repeat of last year's problems.

Chief
Superintendent Dave Hardcastle, of Hampshire Police, said: 'Our focus 
is on helping to ensure such a large influx and exit of people is 
handled safely and with the minimum of impact.'

A wet weekend will be followed by unsettled weather at the beginning of next week, forecaster have warned today.

Parts of the country were battered with rain today, but warmer weather may return for the second day of Royal Ascot which begins on Tuesday.

Met Office spokeswoman, Lindsay Mears, said: 'We have had some pretty unsettled weather over the last week, and we had some high winds on Thursday.

'But it looks like it is going to get warmer, with temperatures reaching into the early 20s by Wednesday, particularly in the south as the jet stream moves north.

'As for this weekend it looks like it's going to be rather wet in the south, but temperatures will be quite high.'

There will be a divide in the weather between north western and south eastern areas over the weekend, according to the Met Office.

Ms Mears said the jet stream, which until recently has remained in the same position right over the UK, is on the move again but will continue to bring squally weather.

She said: 'The position of the jet stream makes the weather largely unsettled but there will be a north-south divide in the amount of rain people will get.

'As it moves north conditions in the south should come closer to the average for this time of year.

'The north will have cloud with no rain, whereas the south will have cloud and showery rain with sunny intervals on Saturday, but as it moves north the band of rain and wind will move with it.

'It will be cloudy and rainy in the south this weekend but that does not necessarily mean it won't be warm, there will be normal temperatures for the south but it will be cooler in the north.

'It will be similar on Sunday until Tuesday, with cloud and sunny intervals across the country until Wednesday morning.'

As for any rumours of a heatwave, she said: 'We haven't seen any evidence of one yet but whatever we say we try to say reasonably optimistically - so if that's what the forecasters tell us we will go with it.'
