A four year old boy believed to be responsible for an attack on a two-year-old girl has been suspended from the club.

But the parents say the centre should be closed down until a full investigation is completed into the attack.

The toddler's mother, Kristel Ness, posted pictures of her bruised two-year-old daughter Eva on Facebook on Saturday, after she was allegedly attacked in the crèche at a Virgin Active Health Club in Frenchs Forest, on Sydney's Northern Beaches.

‘What is quite beyond belief is that not only could his occur while at a care facility, but that all staff claim they did not see the incident. How is that possible at any care facility which is meeting its duty of care?' said Eva's father, Rob Ness.

‘My personal opinion is the day care facilities at this particular club should be closed until a full investigation is done and the club procedures, staffing ratios and skill levels are properly assessed.’

The club has confirmed that the four-year-old boy has been suspended from the creche and the section of the 'Club V' creche where the incident took place, known as 'Big A', has been temporarily closed.

Kristel Ness told Daily Mail Australia that her daughter, Eva, suffered extensive injuries when she was attacked by a four-year-old boy while in childcare at the health club on Sydney’s Northern Beaches on Saturday morning.

The club confirmed they are investigating the incident and say they have contacted the family to ‘apologise unreservedly’.

Local police have also visited the parents, the club and confirm that investigations are ongoing.

Virgin Active say no staff members witnessed the incident, which Ms Ness says left her daughter with ‘a black eye, bites, hematomas, and scratches on her head and face’.

Ms Ness also claims that when she arrived to pick up Eva, her daughter was not wearing pants.

‘It would have taken a while for Eva to receive the extensive injuries. I cannot believe that no one saw,’ Ms Ness told Daily Mail Australia.

Kristel Ness posted on the 'Northern Beaches Mums' Facebook group, but the post, which included photos of her daugher's injuries, was removed by someone else.

The Virgin Active Health Club in Frenchs Forest where it is believed the two-year-old was attacked by another child.

‘When I arrived at the crèche she was so upset but wouldn’t come to me. When we got home she was still screaming, so I gave her some Panadol and let her sleep instead of taking her straight to the doctor, so she could calm down.

‘I then took her to the doctor and he couldn’t examine her properly, she was hiding in the corner. Normally she loves the doctor. She wears her own stethoscope and loves it.’

‘Eva has bounced back a little but gets teary when I ask her about it and says, “no, no, no”. ‘

The club told Mail Australia: ‘We had an unfortunate incident occur between two young children at our Frenchs Forest club.

'On Saturday 23 August, a 2-year old girl was playing in our kids club, Club V, at our club in Frenchs Forest, when she suffered bruising to the face and bite marks on her face and back, following an altercation with another child in the facility.

'Our staff were nearby, but did not witness the incident, and were not able to prevent it.

‘We are currently undertaking a full investigation to understand, exactly what took place, how it could have been prevented, and what can be done to prevent a similar incident happening in the future.

‘We are extremely sorry that this incident has taken place, and have apologised unreservedly to the little girl and her family.'

Kristel Ness says her daughter was crying and unsettled when they came home from the health club. Ms Ness gave her daughter Panadol so she could sleep, at which point she took this photo to document the injuries, before taking her daughter to the doctors.

Ms Ness took her children to the crèche at 10.30am and left at 10.45am. She says was called about the incident an hour later.

Her husband Rob then emailed the club to claim: ‘My wife was contacted by a staff member & told Eva had been bitten by a baby, but was okay & there was no need for her to come straight away. Regardless she did go to check on Eva immediately & slowly we began to realise the terror our daughter must have been put through.’

Eva and her one-year-old sister Mia have attended the day care four to five times a week for two months.

‘She’s unsettled, it seems like she’s having nightmares and she’s waking through the night. I’ve been sleeping by her side,’ Ms Ness said.

‘The police came over and then went to the crèche but I don’t know the outcome, I won’t know until I see the police report.’

The incident report filled out by the head of the crèche states that: ‘Eva was playing with another child who retaliated and hurt her.’

The health club, Virgin Active, says they are extremely sorry about the incident and apologise unreservedly to the parents.

‘We are still getting weird conflicting stories. We are so disappointed with how Virgin has responded,’ Ms Ness told Daily Mail Australia.

‘When the club’s operations director came to our home last night, I was so unhappy (with what was being said) I soon asked him to leave.

Ms Ness says she received an anonymous letter from the mother of the child who is believed to have attacked Eva.

The mother wrote that the child involved has had 'his superhero costumes have been taken away and he has been made to do more chores' to reprimand him.

‘The club put a message out on Facebook saying that they were concerned for our family before contacting us. They posted a long message but from what I’ve seen I believe none of it is true. They are just trying to hush it all up.

‘One of the things that makes me most angry was that Eva didn’t have pants on when I arrived. I saw them carrying the pants out of the area, called the Big A (where Eva was found after the attack),’ she said, adding that the pants weren’t returned to her until last night.’

A NSW Police spokesman said an investigation was continuing.

Eva's parents do not feel that the incident is being taken seriously by the club and are dissatisfied by their conversations with the club, who say they are launching a full investigation.
