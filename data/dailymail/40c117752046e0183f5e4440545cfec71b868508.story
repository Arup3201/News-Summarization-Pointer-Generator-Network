A death metal band is living up to the type of music it creates by risking suffocation and playing in an airtight, soundproof steel box. 

The band, called Unfathomable Ruination, has been performing on the streets of London as part of a project called Box Sized DIE and they play until the oxygen runs out.

The idea was the creation of Portuguese artist Joao Onofre which formed part of an exhibition called Sculpture in the City.

Art? The band called Unfathomable Ruination perform with the doors of the steel box open

This performance art involves one sound-proof steel cube and a metal band that plays inside until oxygen runs out

The band will be performing three times a week until August 1 in London's financial district and much like the offices around it, passers-by cannot hear or see what is going on inside. 

According to the musicians, conditions inside the cube are extremely hot, but they feel it is worth it all in the name of art.

Daniel Herrera, Unfathomable Ruination’s guitarist, said: ‘These are extreme conditions and we play extreme music so this our connection.’

The band play first with the doors open and then with the doors closed.

The idea was the creation of artist Joao Onofre (pictured) standing in front of the band

According to the artist behind the piece, the box is a symbol of the 'boxy' offices in the area where people work. 

Onofre said: 'In this corporate architecture you do not see what is going on inside. The same thing is happening here.'

So how long can a death metal band play in an airtight, soundproof box - the band lasted 14 minutes the first time they played and have so far reached the 19 minute mark.
