A border terrier with a damaged front leg has been given a new lease of life after her owner bought her a state of the art wheelchair.

Hope, whose leg was shattered after her mother stood on her when she was just a few weeks old, spent the first seven years of her life hopping around on just three legs.

But her owner, Liz Hennel, 58, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, found out about a pet wheelchair specialist based in Massachusetts, and ordered a custom-built set of wheels for the lame dog.

After some time getting used to them, Hope realised what the wheels were for, and is now bounding around like a puppy.

There's no stopping her now: Hope the border terrier has a new lease of life with her custom-made wheels

Devoted owner: Liz Hennel chose Hope because she was disabled and vowed to bring her up like any other dog

Hope is believed to be one of only two dogs in the country to have a wheelchair for the front legs

Mrs Hennel, who works in a rehab home for injured racehorses, said: 'Hope had a damaged leg when we got her - the accident with her leg happened when she was very small and her bones were soft, so there was nothing the breeder could do.

'We picked Hope because of her disability and I made a deal with the breeder that I would raise her as a normal dog.

'She was a beautiful little dog, very confident, and by no means the runt of the litter.'

But as the years went by, Mrs Hennel and her husband, Mike, 71, noticed that their pet was having more trouble getting around.

Mrs Hennel said: 'She had always been a very active dog, and used to do everything regardless of her disability.

'But if her good leg gave up, she wouldn't be able to get around.  So it was potentially life-limiting for her.'

The couple discovered US firm Eddie's Wheels online, and sent them Hope's measurements before paying £360 for a two-wheeled strap-on cart that fitted their beloved pet.

It's quite uncommon to have wheels on the front legs - I think she is one of only two dogs in the country to have them,' Mrs Hennel said.

But they have worked.

'Hope has had her cart now for five years, and it has enormously improved her life,' she said.

'It has been a learning curve for her and she is still learning new tricks - but once she realised what the wheels were for she was fantastic on them.'

Now the couple want to spread the word so that other disabled pets can benefit, too.

'The more people who know about what can be done for disabled animals, the better,' Mrs Hennel said.
