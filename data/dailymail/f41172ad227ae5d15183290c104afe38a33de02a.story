Manchester United have made a £56million bid for Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani, according to reports in Italy.

Daily newspaper Tuttosport report that Cavani, who spent six years in Italy with Palermo and Napoli, is top of new United manager Louis van Gaal's wishlist.

The Uruguay striker, 27, only joined PSG last summer for around £55m, but is said to be unhappy in Paris at having to play second fiddle to Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Cavani spent much of last season playing out wide to accommodate for PSG's No 1 superstar Ibrahimovic.

Van Gaal is planning an overhaul of United's squad ahead of his first season at Old Trafford but is yet to make a signing and insists he is concentrating solely on his role at the World Cup as Holland manager.

Sportsmail revealed United were interested in Cavani as early as February but the striker is thought to be unwilling to give up playing Champions League football.

Cavani scored 25 goals in 43 games for PSG in all competitions last season and will spearhead Uruguay's attack against England in the World Cup group stage later this month.
