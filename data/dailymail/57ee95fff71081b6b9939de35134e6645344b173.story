Roy Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson did book publicity in London over the weekend. Keane was hardly mentioned by Ferguson, while Keane, normally quick to mention his favourite F word chose to talk about another of his famous feuds at the London Sports Writing Festival.

Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. 

Meanwhile, Fergie was predictably given the easiest of times by United fan interviewer James Nesbitt who preferred to have him talking about his ‘greatest experience outside football’ — helping Paul McGinley motivate his Ryder Cup winners.

Roy Keane was shown a red card for pushing Alan Shearer, who had wound up the Manchester United skipper with his time-wasting tactics in 2001

Keane said later he wished he had punched Newcastle striker Shearer after being sent off

The ludicrous FIFA watches farce continues with ethics committee investigatory head Michael Garcia writing to FA chairman Greg Dyke warning him of possible disciplinary action if he doesn’t return his £16,400 Parmigiani watch, given as a delegate gift at the FIFA Congress. Dyke had already notified Garcia that he intends to auction it for the benefit of a cancer charity.

Christian Purslow used to work for Liverpool and is joining Chelsea

Ex-Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow’s rent-a-quote role for Sky Sports News on all football business matters seems to have been rewarded with his appointment as Chelsea’s head of global commercial activities — effectively replacing Ron Gourlay who left Stamford Bridge last week. 

It also may have helped Purslow, who Gary Neville called a ‘clueless fool’ for saying Manchester United may never return to the Champions League if they don’t qualify this season, that he has City links with Chelsea director Eugene Tenenbaum.

Racing Post had chief executive Alan Byrne at Doncaster but got sub-editor Andrew Pennington to present their trophy for the feature race to winning owner Sheik Fahad, as part of their protest about the cost of racing data with Arena Racing Company who own the racetrack. The trade paper also cancelled all their usual corporate hospitality.

John McEnroe has delayed launch of his second autobiography But Seriously

Tennis legend John McEnroe’s second autobiography But Seriously, published by Orion, was due out this month but has been delayed by a year for a number of reasons including the drug-related problems of his son Kevin. 

The 28-year-old was arrested in New York’s East Village last July after police witnessed him buying six packets of a white substance thought to be cocaine. Kevin had been duped by his drug dealer who sold him baking soda.
