Dedicated: Prince Philip, pictured at Sunday mass in Sandringham this week, has attended more Royal engagements this year than last despite his ill health

He made his dedication to his role clear when he stood in the wind and rain for hours during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant.

And despite repeatedly battling ill health, the Duke of Edinburgh carried out more official engagements over the past 12 months than he did the previous year.

Prince Philip, 91, conducted more than  340 official jobs in 2012, up from around  330 in 2011.

His recent bouts of ill health have led to concerns that he is doing too much.

He began the year with strict instructions from doctors to rest after undergoing emergency heart surgery for a blocked artery.

In June, he suffered a serious bladder infection, believed to have been aggravated by the bad conditions at the river pageant.

In August, the infection returned and he spent another five days in hospital.

It is known that the Queen wants her husband to take life a little easier but Philip is not one to heed such advice.

The Queen, who is herself 86, is equally busy – conducting more than 370 engagements over the past year, a slight rise on 2011.

Although she is gradually cutting back on her public commitments, it is clear she is also determined to uphold her strong work ethic.

Prince Charles and Princess Anne continue to be the hardest-working members of the Royal Family, conducting just under 600 engagements each over the past year.

Although Charles’s total is slightly down on the previous year, aides say this was largely due to three foreign tours which involved several days of travel.

The Duchess of Cornwall expanded her diary, carrying out more than 270 official engagements – a rise of nearly 12 per cent on 2011.

Prince Andrew, who was forced to quit
his role as a trade ambassador in 2011 after a string of scandals, 
carried out around 400 UK-based engagements over the past year.

He
also managed to squeeze in several meetings with old friends, including
representatives from Thailand, China and, most controversially, 
Azerbaijan, a country which has been accused of human rights abuses and 
widespread corruption.

Although
they are arguably the most high-profile royals besides the Queen, the 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry carried out relatively 
few engagements, as both William and his brother – who conducted 95 and 
71 engagements respectively – have full-time jobs in the Armed Forces.

The
Duchess of Cambridge has no full-time job and carried out only 122 
public engagements, but aides stressed that she is a military wife, not a
full-time working royal.
