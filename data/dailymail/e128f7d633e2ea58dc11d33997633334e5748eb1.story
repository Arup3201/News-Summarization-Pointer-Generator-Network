The NBA and Adidas have unveiled the uniforms for the 64th All-Star Game to take place in New York City in February.

The uniforms for the game between the stars of the Eastern Conference and Western Conference recognise the city's basketball history.

The Eastern Conference side will wear white while the Western Conference will line up in black at Madison Square Garden on February 15.

The jerseys feature a panel of five stars, each of which represents New York City's five boroughs - Queens, Staten Island, Manhattan, The Bronx and Brooklyn - with a unique pattern.

Adidas global basketball general manager Chris Grancio said: 'The NBA All-Star Game is a celebration of the host city and basketball culture, and this year we created our most detailed and sophisticated uniforms to date that pay homage to New York and All-Star weekend.

'We took inspiration from all five boroughs, in addition to the rich basketball and cultural heritage of the city, to provide a memorable collection for players and fans.'

The All-Star jerseys will be available to buy on NBAStore.eu in January.

The Eastern Conference came out on top 163-155 when the teams met last season in New Orleans, Louisiana.
