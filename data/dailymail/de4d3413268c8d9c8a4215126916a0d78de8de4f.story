They say good things come to those who wait.

But these orangutans could not be bothered with that.

Teased with a box of food that was padlocked shut, the furry animals decided to fashion tools out of twigs in a bid to break into the banquet.

Curious: As the ape tries to work out the secret to getting his snack, an equally intrigued otter watches intently

The event was part of an 'enrichment exercise' set by the zoo.

Keepers found the apes benefit from challenges which force them to come up with creative ways of attaining their goal.

But this time, what started as a whimsical activity became the must-see event of the day for a gaggle of otters.

Novel attempts: The HagenBeck Zoo orangutans first tried to get in with their hands but moved on to a stick

Second time lucky? One of the apes then moves round to try the other side with a thinner twig - to no avail

Flocking over to the Orangutan House 
from their own private lake in HagenBeck Zoo, Hamburg, they are pictured
 staring intently at their neighbours' relentless attempts to get 
dinner.

While the apes are confined to their two-storey, dome-covered home, the otters are free to venture out to mingle with their fellow caged animals.

Unfortunately for the orangutans, the visitors were not much of a helping hand.

The hungry animals start their challenge by trying to open the back of the three-tiered case of nibbles with their hands.

Audience participation: Determined to complete the task, the orangutan doesn't spot an otter putting his paw in

When that fails, they take to the door of the box with a stick.

Hitting a wall once more, they move round, peering in and repositioning their tool countless times.

The otters are enthralled by the mission.

After watching from afar, some approach the stone pedestal to join in, peeking round at the apes while seemingly trying their own luck at opening the box on the other side.
