'Diabolical catastrophe': Ten Tory MPs are calling for NHS chief Sir David Nicholson to quit for presiding over the scandal at Stafford Hospital

Ten Tory MPs are calling for NHS chief Sir David Nicholson to quit for presiding over the ‘diabolical catastrophe’ at Stafford Hospital.

Charlotte Leslie, MP for Bristol North West, has drawn up a Commons Early Day Motion calling for him to ‘face consequences’ for the scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly.

Two other MPs compared the scandal to the cover-up over the 1989 Hillsborough football tragedy, suggesting that officials and former ministers may have known more about the appalling abuse and still have questions to answer.

The growing clamour in Parliament for Sir David to fall on his sword increases the pressure on David Cameron, who repeated yesterday that he had his full backing and is ‘doing a very good job’.

However, Miss Leslie attacked the ‘thunderous silence around the NHS...which goes well beyond Stafford’. She called for Sir David, former health secretaries and other officials to reveal what they knew about high mortality rates and whistleblowers, and said that NHS failures could be widespread.

Fourteen more trusts are being investigated over 7,000 deaths from 2006 to 2010, according to figures released by the Conservatives. Miss Leslie said that up to 2,800 of those people ‘should have been saved’ because they died after 2008 after the horrors at Mid Staffordshire had been exposed.

The MPs are calling for Sir David to resign as chief executive of the NHS because of his previous role as head of the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which managed Mid Staffordshire hospitals but failed to spot the abuse.

A Tory source said Sir David was a ‘dead man walking’, but believed that he was being kept on to oversee crucial NHS reforms as 200 commissioning boards take control of budgets on April 1.

Miss Leslie said: ‘There has been a thunderous silence around the NHS and the Mid Staffs scandal and relatives of those who died needlessly have been screaming into a vacuum for those in positions of authority who were responsible to be held to account. Talking about accountability is meaningless if no action is taken. We are calling for a proper investigation into who else knew what and when, from managers to former officials and former ministers, and for them to be held accountable.

‘David Nicholson was then overall in charge of Mid Staffs. In no other walk of life would a man who had overseen such a diabolical catastrophe keep his job.’ 

Two recent polls have shown that nine out of 10 NHS staff believe he should quit his £270,000-a-year post. 

Last night, the ten MPs who backed calls for Sir David’s resignation included Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, who told the Mail earlier this week that Sir David should resign for overseeing a ‘culture of secrecy and cover up that cost many people their lives’. 

One of Mr Bridgen’s constituents, John Moore-Robinson, 20, was taken to Stafford Hospital with a ruptured spleen after a motorbike accident, but was diagnosed with fractured ribs and sent home with painkillers. He bled to death hours later at his home in Coalville, Leicestershire in April 2006. Dr Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes and a former GP, said: ‘I find it extraordinary that more than a thousand people died at an NHS hospital and no one takes the rap.

‘If a thousand people died in a prison or at the hands of the police it would be unthinkable for someone not to stand down.’

Chris Skidmore, who will question Sir
David at the health select committee next month, said: ‘If I was in his
position, I would go. 

‘I 
find it very difficult to believe someone whose hand was at the tiller 
was ignorant of what was happening at Mid Staffs. It is comparable to 
Hillsborough – this is 1,200 patients dying in their own urine and 
faeces and having to drink water from flowerpots, it is horrendous on an
epic scale.

‘It is 
culpability or ignorance and if he didn’t know he should have done, so 
it creates serious doubts about his fitness to continue and drive 
forward the changes needed in the NHS.’ 

Labour’s
health spokesman Andy Burnham, who was health secretary at the time of 
the scandal, yesterday claimed that despite the Stafford Hospital 
failings, the NHS had got ‘much better’ under Sir David’s watch. Steve 
Barclay, MP for North East Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Andy Burnham 
commendably led Parliament in calling for the full truth about 
Hillsborough, because we had official reports which did not give 
families the justice they demanded, and it took Parliament many years to
get to the truth.

‘Families shouldn’t have to wait years for the full truth about Stafford to come out. It absolutely beggars belief that some hospitals were given foundation trust status with high mortality rates and ministers were never told.’ 

Last night, MPs Charlotte Leslie, Andrew Bridgen, Nick de Bois, Mark Field, Kate Hoey and Nicholas Soames said they had signed the motion, while another four spoke to the Mail expressing their support for it.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘David Cameron understands the strength of feeling from the families and relatives of those who suffered at Mid Staffs. Sir David did the right thing in apologising for the period he was in charge of the Strategic Health Authority. He is doing a very good job.’
