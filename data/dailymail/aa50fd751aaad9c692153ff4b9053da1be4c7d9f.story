These incredible pictures of paintings in the desert have actually been created with a simple optical illusion - by clamping a mirror in an easel to reflect the stunning landscape.

Photographer Daniel Kukla placed a square mirror clamped in an easel in key locations around the 429,690 acre Joshua Tree National Park in southern California.

He then angled the mirror so it would capture the beautiful horizon of the desert in sharp contrast to the landscape directly behind the easel.

Mr Kukla, who also has a background in biology and anthropology, was awarded an artist's residency by the United States National Park Service at the Joshua Tree National Park.

And he used his unique position to capture an incredible array of photos, entitled The Edge Effect, that show the variety of scenery to be found in the  desert.

He said: 'While staying in the Park, I spent much of my time visiting the borderlands of the park and the areas where the low Sonoran desert meets the high Mojave desert.

'While hiking and driving, I caught glimpses of the border space created by the meeting of distinct ecosystems in juxtaposition, referred to as the Edge Effect in the ecological sciences.

Under the Joshua Tree: The sun setting behind the rocky hills of the desert which was declared a national park in 1994

Camouflaged: Straddling the San Bernardino County border, the park includes parts of two deserts, the Mojave Desert and Colorado Desert

Rocking it: The mirror reflection of a clear blue sky surrounded by rocky mounds

'To document this unique confluence of 
terrains, I hiked out a large mirror and painter’s easel into the 
wilderness and captured opposing elements within the environment.

'Using a single visual plane, this series of images unifies the play of temporal phenomena, contrasts of color and texture, and natural interactions of the environment itself.'

The resulting images create the bizarre illusion of looking at a paintings in the middle of the desert.

Mr Kukla has worked on numerous photography projects on various subjects that can be viewed on his website - including pieces on zoos, global warming and fairgrounds.
