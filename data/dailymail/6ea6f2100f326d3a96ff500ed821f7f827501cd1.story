Prince Harry today met soldiers and veterans hoping to be selected for the first Invictus Games for injured troops, which will take place from September 10 - 14 this year.

The Prince talked to veterans and watched them in action as they trained for the Paralympic-style games during his visit to the Help For Heroes gym at Tedworth House in Tidworth, Wiltshire.

The 29–year-old, himself a member of the armed forces, is a passionate supporter of Help for Heroes and recently completed a gruelling trek to the South Pole with the charity.

The Prince seemed blown away - and perhaps a little intimidated - at the speed of the games

The Prince, who is known as Captain Harry Wales in his military role, chatted enthusiastically with the sporting hopefuls, obviously impressed as he watched them show off their skills.

Prince Harry launched the Invictus Games for injured troops at the Olympic Park in March, having been determined to bring a competition for injured servicemen and woman to Britain after seeing the positive effect of the American equivalent.

The games are modelled on the US Warrior Games and allows injured servicemen and women to compete in a variety of sports including athletics, archery, wheelchair basketball, road cycling, indoor rowing and wheelchair rugby.

Tedworth house is one of four recovery centres run by Help for Heroes, which form part of the Defence Recovery Capability, providing support to serving and veteran members of the Armed Forces who have been wounded, injured or become sick.

During his visit, Harry looked totally at ease, dressed down in a low-slung pair of blue 
jeans, brown suede shoes, and an official Help for Heroes Invictus Games zip-up jumper.

The young Prince and his older brother have both been closely involved with Help for Heroes for years, but while William has put aside his active military duties for now to focus on royal – and family - life, Harry remains very active.

Harry launched Invictus Games for injured troops himself at the Olympic Park in March and it remains a cause very close to his heart

The Prince, who started a desk job in London in January arranging ceremonial events, remains qualified as an Apache pilot, having flown sorties against the Taliban in 2012-2013

Harry could be asked to return to frontline duty in Afghanistan due to a shortage of crew to fly Apache helicopters, according to defence sources.

The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC) – which Harry joined from the Household Cavalry to fly Apaches – is embarking on a final tour of Afghanistan as the AAC  faces a 40 per cent shortage of senior air crew.
