A teacher went to see The Imitation Game at the cinema - only to discover her father had helped Alan Turing break the Enigma Code.

Primary school teacher Jane Smith, 54, of St Andrews, Fife, went to see the film, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, knowing her father John Harrison had been involved in code breaking during the war.

But she was unaware that the mathematician, who rarely spoke of his wartime service, was part of the exclusive team whose heroic exploits inspired the film.

Proud legacy: Jane Smith, who watched the movie The Imitation Game, and realised that her father John Harrison (pictured), was one of the characters and worked at Bletchley Park alongside Alan Turing

Mr Harrison, who died in 2012, was head-hunted to join the code-breaking team while he was an economics student at Cambridge University.

At the time, in the early 1940s, Britain was losing the Battle of the Atlantic and was on the verge of being invaded  by Germany.

Geniuses were needed to crack the highly cryptic code Germans used to communicate with their U-boat submarines.

He was among a team recruited to work with the genius Alan Turing at Bletchley Park HQ in Buckinghamshire.

Turing's top-secret work with cryptologists and math wizards at Britain's decryption centre saved countless lives by breaking Germany's Enigma machine code.

Pioneer: Alan Turing, whose work was instrumental in cracking the Enigma Code

But the computer pioneer received no credit, died a broken man, and was only pardoned for charges of homosexuality, a crime in 1952, 60 years after his death in 1954. 

The codebreakers were bound by the official secrets act and forbidden to utter a word of their mission.

True to his word, her father kept most of his work secret until his death, aged 90.

He only mentioned brief details to Jane, her two brothers and her sister.

'He said he had been recruited after one of his university lecturers asked him to quickly complete a tough newspaper crossword,' Mrs Smith said.

'But we didn't know for years how valuable his wartime work was.

'More details only emerged in 2008 when I asked him to speak to some of my primary seven pupils about his experiences.

'I was teaching the children how to gather impartial evidence from people who had lived or witnessed historical events.

'However, dad told me he wouldn't have had much to say about the war except he went to work at Bletchley Park in a suit and carried a briefcase every day and he'd been drafted into it after solving a crossword. The talk to pupils never happened.'

Mrs Smith did not recognise the significance of his words until she went to see hit film The Imitation Game.

'It was only when I watched the film with my husband, Blair, last week that the final pieces of the jigsaw fell into place and we truly realised dad's contribution to the war,' she adds.

'No one would ever have known or guessed his part in the Alan Turing story because dad was never one to boast or push himself forward.

'This was so typical of him and his loyalty to his country.

'Now the story is unfolding, we are prouder than ever of his contribution.'

Mrs Smith said she is not sure if her father features as a particular character. 

She added: 'One of the characters in the film, who appears quiet and in the background could be him. He didn't push himself forward which would have been in-keeping with my father's personality. We are not sure though as they changed the names of the other characters in the background. 

'I imagine not much would have been known about him but someone who worked with him could have given the information. He took the responsibility of the Official Secrets Act very seriously. The film fleshed out what little we knew about his role in what happened.' 

Mrs Smith and her family were thrilled when her father was awarded a medal for his code-breaking in 2010.

'It was wonderful for dad to be recognised for his contribution,' Jane said.

One of the mother's  favourite possessions is a photograph she has of her dad completing a crossword while holding her daughter Beth, 21, when she was only four months old.

'His love of puzzles lasted till a few months before his death and dad was as sharp as a tack to the end.'

John spent most of his life working in London as an accountant for the Scottish firm, Thomson McLintock, which evolved into KPMG.

On retiring he returned to his home town of St Andrews with his wife, Morag, an artist.

He also loved golf, at one time playing off a handicap of scratch, and was a member of the Royal and Ancient golf club.

The club flag flew at half-mast the day he died and also on the day of his funeral.

Like many of his generation Mr Harrison was a man who never basked in the glory of his wartime effort but moved on quietly with his life when the job was done.

'To work with Alan Turing must have been hugely stressful, but the project must have been ultimately rewarding,' Jane added.
