The live-in lover of French President Francois Hollande today infuriated the mother of his four children by backing her electoral rival for a place in Parliament.

Valerie Trierweiler, 47, has never made any secret of her dislike for Segolene Royal, the 58-year-old who shared Mr Hollande's life for more than 30 years.

Ms Royal was, in turn, devastated when Mr Hollande left her for Ms Trierweiler, a Paris Match magazine journalist, in 2007.

Now Ms Royal, herself a former Socialist government minister who stood for the presidency in 2007, is standing for a place in the National Assembly.

Ms Royal gained 32 per cent of the vote in the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday in the western constituency of La Rochelle, and hopes to win outright in the second round on Sunday.

But Olivier Falorni, a
 popular local Socialist politician in La Rochelle, is standing against 
her and achieved 29 per cent of the vote last Sunday.

Everybody
 expected Mr Hollande to back Ms Royal, but today Ms Trierweiler sparked
 outrage by using her Twitter account to post a message of support for 
Mr Falorni.

It reads: 'Good luck to Olivier Falorni who was not unworthy, who fights alongside the people of La Rochelle for so many years with selfless commitment.'

Such a message, from the serving first lady of France, could easily swing the election against Ms Royal and effectively end her political career.

'It's a devastating blow for Segolene, and she's infuriated by what has happened,' said a Socialist Party insider.

'The party has been plagued by in-fighting for many years, but Segelone never expected the President's new lover to make such a provocative gesture.' 

Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place'

Asked by AFP, France's national news agency, if she was indeed supporting Mr Falorni, Ms Trierweiler simply sent them a text reading: 'Yes'.

A senior Elysee Palace presidential aide meanwhile told Le Monde newspaper: 'I am completely blown away. I expected a government crisis, not a domestic one. It's amazing.'

Ms Trierweiler has been nicknamed the 'Rottweiler' by conservative politicians, and refuses to give up her job writing for one of France's most sensationalist glossies.

Ms Royal had no initial comment, but critics said it was another example of Ms Trierweiler abusing her new position at the heart of the French Republic to make mischief. 

One of many angry messages which Ms Trierweiler received back on Twitter was from Royal supporter Serge Pastor and reads: 'I did not think that female jealousy went that far.'

Ms Royal, who started going out with Mr Hollande when they were still students, stood against him for the Socialist presidential candidacy last year.

Her career has been going rapidly downhill since then, but she was hopeful that a parliamentary seat would help revive it.
