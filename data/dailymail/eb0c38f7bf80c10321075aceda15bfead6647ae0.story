The intense hatred between the two main women in the life of Francois Hollande has boiled over in yet another bitter exchange, with one calling the other 'nasty and aggressive'.

Segolene Royal, the mother of the French president's four children and a leading Socialist politican in her own right, has always been a fierce critic of his new girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler.

Ms Trierweiler, a 48-year-old divorced glossy magazine journalist, caused outrage last year when she tweeted support for a rival of Ms Royal in a parliamentary election - one which Ms Royal went on to lose.

Ms Royal, 59, has also never forgiven her love rival for conducting an affair with Mr Hollande behind her back.

In a TV interview to publish a new book, Ms Hollande was asked if she had forgiven Ms Trierweiler.

Ms Royal replied: 'In life, when you are betrayed, when someone hurts you - what is more, gratuitously - when it's ferocious, when it's violent, if you want to survive you have to forgive.

'At the end of the day, they hurt themselves, you know, nasty and aggressive people.'

While the apparent attempt to 'forgive' may be welcomed by Ms Trierweiler, the subsequent insult will hurt both her and Mr Hollande.

The infamously hen-pecked head of state has constantly tried to act as a peacemaker between the two women, pleading with them to keep his private life out of the headlines.

Ms Trierweiler is currently in Mali on her first solo trip as France's First Lady, as she tries to win some support among the French public.

She is widely disliked and mistrusted, not just because of her very colourful private life, but because of her obsession with taking fellow journalists to court.

Despite working for Paris Match, a magazine which thrives on writing about the private lives of public figures, and carrying intimate photos of them, she regularly sues anybody who does the same to her and Mr Hollande.

Neither the Elysee Palace, nor spokes people for Ms Royal and Ms Trierweiler would comment on their latest spat.
