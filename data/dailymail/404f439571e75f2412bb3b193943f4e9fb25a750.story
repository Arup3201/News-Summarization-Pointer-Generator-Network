An cult member has been charged with murder, rape, sodomy and incest after a 15-month-old girl he fathered with his daughter starved to death.

Calvin Mcintosh, 44, was arrested after he brought Alcenti Mcintosh's neglected and abused body into a hospital in Gwinnett County, Georgia. 

Police then searched his room at the Extended Stay Hotel in Peachtree Corners and found three other children, two aged three and one aged five, and her 23-year-old daughter Najlaa Mcintosh - who the suspect also fathered two children with.

Iasia Sweeting, 21, a mother of two of McIntosh's children including Alcenti, was also discovered on the floor of the hotel covered in blankets and in 'desperate need of medical attention', according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Sweeting was emaciated and weighed a shocking 59 pounds. 

Horror: Calvin Mcintosh, 44, (right) and his daughter Najilaa, 23, (right) have been charged with multiple offences including murder after a 15-month-old child was found starved to death in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The pair have two children together 

 McIntosh is said to have ordered Najilaa to deprive the children and Iasia of food if they were disobedient. She has also been charged with multiple offences including murder.

During their search, investigators found notes about the Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, an Islam-based cult which mixes ideas of black supremacy with worship of Egyptians and the pyramids. 

Members also suggest that white people are the devil.  

Following the horrific discovery, Cpl. Edwin Ritter from Gwinnett County police said in a statement: 'The infant … was determined to be dead on arrival.'

'Due to the physical appearance of Alcenti, it was quickly determined by medical personnel that this was most likely a case of neglect and abuse.'

Starved: Police then searched his room at the Extended Stay Hotel and found three other children, two aged three and one aged five, and her 23-year-old daughter Najlaa Mcintosh - who the suspect also fathered two children with

Mcintosh was arrested on multiple charges, including one count of felony murder, one count of malice murder, four counts of cruelty to children in the first degree, one count of cruelty to children in the second degree, one count of cruelty to a physically disabled adult, one count of rape, one count of incest and one count of aggravated sodomy.

Najlaa Mcintosh was charged with one count of felony murder, one count of malice murder, four counts of cruelty to children in the first degree, one count of cruelty to children in the second degree and one count of cruelty to a physically disabled adult.

Calvin and Najlaa Mcintosh are in the Gwinnett County jail. The three children found in the hotel are in the custody of the Division of Family and Children Services.

Sweeting remains in serious condition at Gwinnett Medical Center. 

The cult's leader and founder Dwight York is currently serving a 135-year prison sentence for a string of child molestation charges and racketeering

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center the Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, or Nuwaubianism, is  movement that follows a bizarre theology.

It mixes black supremacist ideas with worship of the Egyptians and their pyramids and adheres to strange beliefs involving UFOs, the Illuminati and Bilderbergers. 

Their leader and founder Dwight York is currently serving a 135-year prison sentence for a string of child molestation charges and racketeering.

He trafficked children as young as four across the country primarily so they could be sexually exploited. 

York was arrested after he had his followers build two pyramids build two pyramids out of wood and stucco and other Egyptian-style buildings on the compound, which they called 'Tama-Re.' 

Most of the Nuwaubians at Tama-Re lived in cheap trailers, while York lived in a mansion on the property. As many as 400 other Nuwaubians lived in the surrounding area.

He once said in a speech: 'White people are the devil. They say the Nuwaubians are not racist – bullcrap! I am…White people are devils — always was, always will be.' 

He is currently serving his sentence in the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX) in Florence, Colorado. 

According to a fact website about the movement, a passage reads: 'We are the Indigenous people of these shores, before the settlers from Europe came to these shores spreading their way of life, their filth and religion.'

Following publication of this article, we have been asked to point out that while Nuwaubianism has historically had links with Islam, the cult doctrine has officially been changed on several occasions. We are happy to clarify this.
