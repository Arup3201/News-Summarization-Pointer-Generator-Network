Rumours of a toymaker's direction to remove the Confederate flag from future Dukes of Hazzard's General Lee cars launched a firestorm this week amid claims by Warner Bros the plans were never true.

Posted to an online message board last week, an insider with manufacturer Tomy Toys allegedly revealed the Southern flag's future ban on all 2013 General Lee cars due to sensitivity issues with its cultural symbolism.

'Starting January 1, 2013 all Dukes of Hazzard General Lee vehicles will not be allowed to be produced with the Confederate flag on the top of the vehicle. This directive has been passed onto us from the licensor Warner Brothers,' the post on HobbyTalk.com read.

Upset: Rumours by Tomy Toys that they would no longer be producing toy cars from the Dukes of Hazzard that feature a Confederate flag on its roof sparked outrage this week

Word of its imminent removal rushed fans of the late 1970s - early 1980s show who made claims on the message board of having already seen versions of the toy vehicle for sale without the flag.

A spokesperson for Warner Bros reported the post’s claims as being false.

'We were not, and are not, planning to change the design of the General Lee on merchandise. All reports to the contrary have been inaccurate,' a spokesperson told NBC.

A blatantly Southern car featured in nearly every episode in the hit TV show, with its painted flag, the orange Dodge Charger driven recklessly throughout Hazzard County by fictional cousins Bo and Luke Duke was aptly named after the Confederate General Robert E Lee - while also playing the first line of Dixie as its horn.

Standing up to the alleged leak this week by both the toy company and Warner Bros who owns the theatrical, DVD and licensing rights to The Dukes of Hazzard, was former Dukes of Hazzard actor Ben Jones.

Rallying through his museum's website of Cooters Place, named after his character of Cooter Davenport on the show, Mr Jones collected signatures fighting the so-called plans.

Mr Jones also penned a letter directed to Warner Bros calling their move 'a new level of "P.C." idiocy.'

'Some unnamed genius at the company feels that the flag is "offensive to some" 
and therefore it has no business on a classic t.v. comedy about a bunch of good 
ol' boys and girls in the Southern mountains. This is a new level of "P.C." 
idiocy. I don't know about you, but I am tired of being insulted by morons,' he wrote in a release.

After collecting signatures, votes and encouraging fans' emails to the entertainment powerhouse, on Thursday Mr Jones released a new statement on his Facebook page capping their efforts.

'There were reliable and verifiable reports from WB car licensees with whom we do business that as of January 1, 2013, the Confederate Banner on top of the General Lee would be removed because some people “found it offensive,” Mr Jones wrote.

Reacting to the news of Warner Bros arguing having never planned to remove the flag from the cars, Mr Jones called the alleged change of heart a 'victory.'

'This is not only a victory for those who love the show, but a victory for the voice of the people, and in my opinion, a victory for mutual respect among people of different ethnicities and backgrounds,’ he wrote.

His elated news reverberated from fans on his Facebook page who gave ample yeehaws, and one woman, an ‘Awwwwwwright!’
