Russell Brand has claimed that Philip Seymour Hoffman is a 'victim' and his death is a consequence of 'extremely stupid drug laws'.

The controversial star, who is a recovering heroin and alcohol addict, argued that the law turns addicts into criminals.

Oscar-winner Mr Seymour Hoffman, 46, was found dead in his rented apartment in Greenwich Village, New York, last Sunday.

He died from an overdose and police found 70 bags of heroin in the property surrounding his body.

In an 800-word essay published in The Guardian, Mr Brand said that most addicts end up dying alone - and he added that the circumstances of the actor's death were 'inescapably bleak'.

In the piece headlined 'Philip Seymour Hoffman is another victim of extremely stupid drug laws', he said that anti-drug laws add to the stigma surrounding addiction.

The 38-year-old has repeatedly called for anti-drug laws to be relaxed - and his reaction to the tragedy in New York does not come as a surprise.

He has previously said he has been sober and not taken drugs for ten years - but thinks about heroin every day.

In the article, he wrote: 'Addiction is a mental illness around which there is a great deal of confusion, which is hugely exacerbated by the laws that criminalise drug addicts.

'If drugs are illegal people who use drugs are criminals. We have set our moral compass on this erroneous premise, and we have strayed so far off course that the landscape we now inhabit provides us with no solutions and greatly increases the problem.'

He added that it was unavoidable that people would use drugs - and banning them makes no difference.

He argued that prohibition creates an unregulated system that leaves people exposed to a drugs empire controlled by criminals.

Mr Brand questioned whether Philip Seymour Hoffman would have died if it were not for the stigma attached to taking illegal substances.

He wrote: 'Would Hoffman have died if this disease were not so enmeshed in stigma? If we weren't invited to believe that people who suffer from addiction deserve to suffer?'

When Mr Seymour Hoffman was found dead he was living in a rented apartment after becoming estranged from Mimi O'Donnell, his partner of 14 years.

Last night Miss O'Donnell was visibly distraught as she attended a wake for the star on the Upper East Side of Manhattan accompanied by the couple's three children and their A-list friends.

Miss O'Donnell arrived holding her sleeping daughter, Willa, 5, just before 5pm.

The actor's mother, Marilyn O'Connor, entered the funeral home soon after and Hoffman's former co-stars Amy Adams, Cate Blanchett, Michelle Williams and Joaquin Phoenix were also in attendance.

Mr Seymour Hoffman, who starred in more than 50 movies, is best known for his roles in Boogie Nights and the Big Lebowski.

He won an Oscar in 2005 for his performance playing Truman Capote in the film Capote.

It was revealed last year that the actor had sought treatment for drug addiction.
