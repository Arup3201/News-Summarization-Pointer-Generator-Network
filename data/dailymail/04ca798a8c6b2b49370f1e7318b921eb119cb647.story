If punctuality is your thing, this is not the flight for you.

A budget airline’s mid-afternoon flight from Luton to Budapest hasn’t left on time once in the last nine months.

The last time Wizz Air flight W62206 departed on time was June 1, 2013.

That equates to 293 consecutive late departures, according to flight data specialists EUclaim.

The report says of the 3hr 25min flight which is scheduled to leave at 2.20pm or 2.25pm depending on the day: ‘Wizz Air flight W62206 from Luton to Budapest has never left on time since 1st June 2013 with 293 consecutive late departures.’

The EUclaim report notes: ‘Making the 927 mile journey every day except Christmas Day, the late-running A320 plane has seen passengers delayed anywhere between two minutes and 12 hours and 18 minutes.

‘On one occasion it was even cancelled altogether. The daily delays add up to over 176 hours of waiting for unlucky passengers.’

However Wizz Air insists that its punctuality is much better than claimed when measured against the industry standard applied by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority which define all flights departing within 15 minutes of the scheduled departure time as being ‘on time’.

It claims commercial ‘bounty hunters such as EU Claims mislead consumers by hiding this fact’. It added that in the few cases where a flight takes off 15 minutes later than scheduled, consumers are mainly interested in arriving on time.

A Wizz Air spokesman said: ‘Some 73.22 per cent of all 295 W62206 flights from London Luton to Budapest from 1 June 2013 to date departed on time, with 78.64 per cent arriving on time in Budapest.’

But flight delay compensation specialist Bott & Co said passengers on nine of the late-running Wizz Air flights would be able to claim compensation under EU Regulation 261/2004.

Some 15 individuals from the qualifying flights (in June, July, October and November 2013) have already approached the law firm to represent them against the airline and are in line to receive £215 (€250) each.

EU regulation 261 entitles travellers to compensation of between €250 (£215) and €600 (£520) if their flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled, or they are denied boarding.

The law applies to flights from EU airports or arriving in the EU on an EU airline, provided the delay or cancellation is not due to extraordinary circumstances.

Paul Hinchliffe, managing partner at Bott & Co said: ‘Consumers in other EU countries tend to be familiar with their rights under Regulation 261, but that’ s not the case here in the UK.

‘We want to change this and help the British public to know their rights and receive the compensation rightly due to them for flight delays and cancellations.’
