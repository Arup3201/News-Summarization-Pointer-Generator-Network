They are two of the nation's most famous scientists, famed for their ground-breaking work in the world of physics. 

But now, Professors Stephen Hawking and Brian Cox also share the honour of becoming fully fledged brands by turning their names into trademarks. 

Hawking, 73, whose life was played out in the successful biopic The Theory of Everything released this year, has applied to the Intellectual Property Office to have his name formally registered. 

Cox, 47, the Human Universe presenter, has already made the move. 

Professor Hawking has turned his name into a brand to prevent inappropriate retailers exploiting it  

Online retailers, such as the site Redbubble, sell T shirts featuring a zombie Stephen Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead' 

There is a wide range of Stephen Hawking memorabilia online, many of which include corny catchphrases 

This will enable the pair to sell their brands for anything from greetings cards to disability aids to set up an educational charity. 

The principle reason behind Professor Hawking's move to trademark his name is for charitable purposes. 

It will give him the option of setting up a foundation, such as one promoting physics or for research into motor neurone disease, which has left him paralysed since he was diagnosed aged 21, in 1963.

The move will also prevent others from exploiting his name with inappropriate products and sees him join the ranks of celebrities who have turned their names into brands, such as JK Rowling and David Beckham. 

There is a wide range of Professor Hawking memorabilia available on the internet, including a thong with his quote 'while there may be primitive life in our region of the galaxy, there don't seem to be any advanced intelligent beings', inked on the front. 

There is also a pair of boxer shorts, available for £8, with a cartoon sketch of the scientist on and T shirts featuring a zombie Professor Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead'.

A spokesman for Cambridge University, where he is a director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, told the Sunday Times: 'It's a personal matter, it is not a university issue, but he has taken measures to protect his name and the success it has brought.' 

TV science presenter Brian Cox has also turned his name into a trademark to prevent retailers cashing in on it

Mr Cox, who was also a keyboard player in the band D:Ream that produced the hit record Things Can Only Get Better (later used as a New Labour election anthem), may have also branded his name to protect his reputation.

Amazon is selling a Brian Cox doll, at £12.99, which is described as being as 'cuddly as the brilliant Professor Brian Cox himself'. 

Retailers also offer coffee mugs bearing his face and T shirts with slogans such as 'I will do science to you', 'I am the master of the universe', and simply 'I love Cox'.
