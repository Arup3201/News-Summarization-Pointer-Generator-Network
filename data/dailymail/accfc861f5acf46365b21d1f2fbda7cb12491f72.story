Heartbroken Mindy McCready faces a new custody battle over her eldest son following the suicide death of her boyfriend, MailOnline can reveal today.

McCready, her mother Melody Gayle Inge and the boy's father Billy McKnight will all stake their claim to look after five-year-old Zander.

The singer's grandmother Gayle told MailOnline today that her daughter was planning to travel to Arkansas to be with her grandson. 

Mourning: David Wilson, seen here with his country singer girlfriend Mindy McCready, was found with a gunshot wound on Sunday night and pronounced dead hours later

The tragedy is almost certain to reignite a tug-of-love battle that captivated America a little over a year ago after McCready was found hiding in a closet in December 2011 with the boy after kidnapping him from her own mother.

'She doesn't want to talk right now, but she will go to Arkansas,' Gayle said at the home she shares with her daughter in Fort Myers, Florida. 'She will want to be there for him.We will have to see what happens,' she added.

Melody was the official legal guardian 
of the boy after Mindy's drink and drug problems became so bad that it 
meant she could not longer look after the child.

Custody: Mindy had been fighting for custody rights over her elder son Zander (pictured) for years and allegedly was just awarded the landmark decision

Zander's father McKnight also had visitation rights to his son and would see him regularly.

Friends said he is also expected to travel to Arkansas in the hope of seeing his son.

The looming custody battle follows the apparent suicide death of McCready's live-in boyfriend David Wilson.

He was found dead at his home in Heber Spring, Arkansas, on Sunday from a self inflicted gunshot wound.

McCready,37, issued as statement saying she had lost her 'soul mate'.

His death is likely to have a huge bearing on her suitability to look after Zander and his nine-month-old brother Zayne, a child she had with Wilson.

Their exact whereabouts is unknown but they are still thought to be in Arkansas.

Friends of McCready's estranged mother is also planning to make the trip with family members saying her primary concern is her grandson. Toys belonging to Zander litter the front entrance to the Melody's home.

'Life partners': McCready, 37, and Wilson, 34, lived together in a home owned by a Wilson relative

A mini motorized jeep and two scooters block most of the entrance way to the modest single storey home.

There are also several children's bikes propped against the garage.

Mrs Inge, 57, was appointed legal guardian by a court in Lee County after Mindy lost custody of Zander in 2007 following drug abuse and battery charges.

The singer launched a battle to retain custody of her son but hit the headlines in 2011 when she failed to return the boy to his father's home in Apollo Beach, Florida, following a visit.

McKnight filed a missing persons report and a judge ordered McCready to return the child by a specified deadline.

She defied the court ruling and it was left to U.S. Marshals to track her and Zander down to Arkansas, at the home of Wilson where they were found hiding in a closet.

A court placed the boy in foster care while McCready did not face any charges.

In the business: Wilson ran Dave Wilson Productions and was also a songwriter

McCready sensationallly claimed that her son was abused by his grandmother in a bid to stop her from retaining legal guardianship.

Since living with 34-year-old Wilson in Arkansas she was able to prove to the court that she was clear of drink and drugs and in February 2012 was granted custody, according to some reports.

But neighbors of Mrs Inge said she had not seen her grandson since.

'Melody loved that little boy and I know she will do all she can to get him back,' said one neighbor.

'She has kept all his toys in his room and will want to make the best life for him.

'From what I gather things are still difficult with her daughter. They have not mended their relationship, and I doubt they ever will.'

Picturesque: Wilson was found shot in the home he and Mindy shared on Fox Chase Road in Eden Isle neighborhood just off Greers Ferry Lake in Arkansas

Too young: Wilson was only 34-years-old when he was found dead on Sunday, and he was the father of Mindy's 9-month-old son Zayne

Mindy McCready was so in love with David Wilson that she felt she 'finally found the one person that she was supposed to be with', her former lawyer also revealed today to MailOnline.

James Moon said: 'I met David a couple of times and he was very protective of Mindy and looked after her very well.

'She was always smiling when she was around him and when she found out she was pregnant she was ecstatic.

'She made a comment to the extent that she felt that she had finally found the one person she was supposed to be with.

'I know David drove her from Arkansas to Florida for one of the child custody meetings which is where I saw him, and on two other occasions.

'I never heard any arguments or any strong words between them'.

Mr Moon, who is based in Fort Myers, Florida, represented McCready until she took her son Zander to Arkansas early last year.

Now that Mr Wilson is dead, Mr Moon said that he hope the judge in Florida that is responsible for her case does not force her to return to the state.

He said: 'She has accomplished so much and I hope the court allows her to continue proving she's a good mum'.

Troubled: Mindy McCready, 37, has waged a public battle with drug addiction since her career peaked in 1996

Meanwhile, an official at Cleburne County Sheriff's department confirmed to MailOnline that police and emergency services responded to a call at approximately 6.15pm on Sunday though it is unclear who made the call.

The house is the same one where McCready was discovered hiding in the closet after the nationwide manhunt.

Wilson is the father of McCready's younger son, Zayne, who was born in April.

'Today, we mourn the loss of my life partner and my children's father, David Wilson,' McCready said in a statement she released on Monday.

'David was my soulmate; he was a caregiver and guiding hand to our sons, Zander and Zayne.

'He was a precious gift from God to all of us and, yesterday, he returned home and is now with his mother and father. David loved and he was loved.

'Those who knew and loved him will miss him; those who did not know David missed the opportunity to know a truly loving and gifted man.'

The police report says that emergency services arrived at Wilson's house on Fox Chase Road at 6.15pm and transported him to nearby Baptist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8pm.

No criminal charges have been filed but the investigation is ongoing. 

Speaking to MailOnline, Mindy's brother Joshua said that she was too upset to talk to anybody.

He said: 'She's going through a lot right now. What happened was tragic, there's no doubt about it.'

Wilson is said to be a record producer and songwriter, though it is unclear who he worked with specifically.

McCready rose to fame in 1996 with her hit country song 'Ten Thousand Angels.' Her album of the same name went double platinum - though that marked the peak of her career. 

She struggled with arrests and drug addition after her career began to faded in the late 1990s.

She was dropped by BNA Records in after her 1999 album had disappointing sales and then dropped by Capitol Records in after her 2002 record suffered the same fate.

She was arrested in Tennessee in 2004 and pleaded guilty to using a fake prescription to buy the painkiller OxyContin.

'I'm Still Here' was praised by critics for McCready's vocal prowess.

She also appeared on Celebrity Rehab with Dr Drew as she attempted to work out her drug issues.

On the show's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships.

Her biography on the show's page says: 'Although she was arrested and jailed for trying to buy OxyContin with a false prescription and attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol, Mindy believes her only true addiction is to violent relationships.'
