Exhausted and losing weight, Nicky Rigby put her symptoms down to the stress of giving birth just five months earlier.

Tragically, she had no idea they were a sign of undiagnosed diabetes which cost the 26-year-old her life.

Miss Rigby died after being found unconscious at home by her fiance. An inquest later heard the mother-of-one had suffered from Type 1 diabetes, which had led to her oesophagus gradually deteriorating.

Nicky Rigby, 26, died just five months after giving birth to daughter Lily from diabetes she never knew she had

Her family later discovered she had many symptoms of undiagnosed type 1 diabetes - including tiredness and weight loss -  but had blamed them on the exhaustion of being a new mum and losing weight after childbirth

Her family discovered she had shown 
all the symptoms of the condition, including tiredness and weight loss, 
but had never been tested for it.

Instead, she assumed they were the result of giving birth to daughter Lily.

Her fiance said that when he took her to a doctor, she was simply prescribed iron tablets.

The
 coroner concluded that she died of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can 
occur when people with diabetes do not get the insulin they need.

Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

This
 happens when a severe lack of insulin means the body cannot use glucose
 for energy, and the body starts to break down other body tissue as an 
alternative energy source.

Ketones
 are the by-product of this process. Ketones are poisonous chemicals 
which build up and, if left unchecked, and will cause the body to become
 acidic – hence the name 'acidosis'.

Left
 untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal 
complications, such as severe dehydration, coma and swelling of the 
brain.

It is not clear how long she had suffered from the condition, or if it was triggered by  the pregnancy.

Her
 devastated fiance, Mark Wilson, is now sharing her story in an attempt 
to raise awareness of diabetes among new mothers and convince them to 
ask for tests if they have any symptoms.

The 29-year-old, from the Wirral, said: ‘Nicky was a natural with Lily, cuddling and feeding her.

‘She loved being a mum, despite the sleepless nights leaving her feeling exhausted.’

Mr
 Wilson said the tablets prescribed by the doctor did not help. ‘She 
didn’t want anyone fussing over her,’ he added. ‘She just said that all 
mums get tired like she was.’

But in July 2012, on Mr Wilson’s birthday, Miss Rigby began complaining of a stomach bug.

The
 following evening, she decided to have an early night while he went out
 with friends. Mr Wilson said: ‘Nicky wasn’t feeling great and insisted I
 go and enjoy myself. I kissed her goodbye then took Lily round to my 
mum’s house so Nicky could have a rest.’

Hours later, he returned home and put his head around the bedroom door to see how his fiancee was doing.

Her devastated fiancé Mark Wilson is now sharing her story in a bid to make other new mothers aware of the condition

'Nicky was a natural with Lily, cuddling and feeding her,' said Mr Wilson (pictured left on holiday in 2009). 'She loved being a mum, despite the sleepless nights leaving her feeling exhausted'

Concerned that Miss Rigby was looking pale and drawn in the months after Lily's birth, Mr Wilson took her to a doctor who prescribed iron tablets, which failed to help

He
 was horrified by what  he saw. ‘I decided to switch on the light to see
 if Nicky was OK, and then saw she was surrounded by black vomit,’ Mr 
Wilson said.

After dialling 999 he began CPR, but she failed to respond.

He added: ‘Soon after, the paramedics arrived and I heard one of them say Nicky had passed away.’

Around
 300,000 people in the UK suffer from type 1 diabetes, which is distinct
 from the much more common type 2 version of the disease.

The main symptoms of diabetes that are common to type 1 and type 2 are:

Feeling
 very thirsty, urinating frequently - particularly at night, feeling 
very tired, weight loss and loss of muscle bulk (in type 1 diabetes)

Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can develop quickly, over weeks or even days.

Other symptoms include:

Itchiness around the vagina or penis, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection),

Blurred vision that is caused by the lens of your eye changing shape

Cramp, skin infections

Vomiting
 or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a 
dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for 
treatment.

The
 inquest in Cheshire heard Miss Rigby’s death could have been prevented 
with simple insulin injections to control her blood sugar.

Mr
 Wilson said: ‘All I could think was Nicky had wanted to be a mum so 
much and now she wasn’t going to get to see our little girl grow up.’

Determined
 that Lily will know her mother, he has put photos of her all over the 
house and made a memory box that they can look through together.

Inside is a gold heart necklace he gave Miss Rigby, as well as her diamond engagement ring.

‘I want Lily to look at the pictures of her mum and know she was a brilliant, fun person,’ he said.

And he warned other women: ‘Please don’t battle on through exhaustion like my brave Nicky tried to do.’

Diabetic ketoacidosis is caused by consistently high blood glucose levels.

It
 occurs when a severe lack of insulin means the body  cannot use glucose
 for energy, and starts to break down other tissue as an alternative 
energy source. This process produces poisonous chemicals  called 
ketones.

Left untreated, 
diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal complications, such as
 severe dehydration and swelling of the brain.

Around 300,000 people in the UK have type 1 diabetes. The
 main symptoms include feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently – 
particularly at night – feeling very tired, weight loss and loss of muscle bulk.

After his wife-to-be's death, Mr Wilson said: 'All I could think was Nicky had wanted to be a mum so much and now she wasn't going to get to see our little girl grow up'

An inquest later heard Miss Rigby's death in July 2012 could have been prevented with simple insulin injections to control her blood sugar. Lily (right) is now two and her father wants to raise awareness of diabetes

They can develop quickly, over weeks or even days.

Sufferers may also experience blurred vision, cramp and skin infections.

Vomiting or heavy, deep breathing can occur at a later stage and are a sign that immediate medical treatment is needed.
