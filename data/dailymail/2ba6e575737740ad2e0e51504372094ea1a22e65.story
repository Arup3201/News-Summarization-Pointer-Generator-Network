A 16-year-old girl found naked and pepper-sprayed on the sidewalk was kidnapped, robbed and possibly sexually assaulted, police have said.

The unnamed teen was found naked on a street in Berkeley, California just after 5am on Wednesday when neighbors heard her screaming, 'Help me!', police told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Police officials said they were 
investigating reports that the girl was kidnapped in Oakland, robbed and

The girl was taken to Highland Hospital in Oakland and is in stable condition.

Thomas Stern told KCBS that he was awoken by the girl's screams.

'She
 yelled that someone had sprayed her in the eyes with something,' he 
said. 'Then shortly after that, I think she yelled that someone had 
raped her.

'Then she collapsed to the ground, she was totally in shock, 
yelling and crying.'

Her continued: 'Seeing
 a naked person that hysterical 
that early in the morning, you would think itâ€™s just some crazy person. 
But who knows what really could have happened. It makes me
 worry.'

Berkeley police said they responded to reports of the girl calling for help at 5.06am and police officers arrived shortly after and found her.

The Oakland Police Department was called in at 6.21 a.m. and is investigating the incident as 'unusual and suspicious'.

KTVU reported that authorities would not be releasing any further information in fear of jeopardizing the investigation.

There is not yet any suspect information, including what car he could have used.
