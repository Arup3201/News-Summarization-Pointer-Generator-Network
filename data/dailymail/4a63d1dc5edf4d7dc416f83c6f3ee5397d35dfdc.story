Manchester City will ramp up their interest in Kevin de Bruyne when director of football Txiki Begiristain watches Wolfsburg's Europa League match with Inter Milan on Thursday night.

The Barclays Premier League champions have long been interested in the 23-year-old Belgian playmaker, who joined the Bundesliga side from Chelsea in January 2014, and Wolfsburg are braced for an offer.

De Bruyne is enjoying an excellent season, scoring 14 goals and contributing 23 assists across all competitions and Wolfsburg understandably want him to commit until 2020.

But City are impressed and could be willing to pay up to £35m to bring him back to the Premier League. French champions Paris Saint-Germain would also like to sign him.

Meanwhile, the former Nottingham Forest, PSV Eindhoven and Holland goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen believes De Bruyne has matured into the 'most complete midfielder in the world.'

Van Breukelen, who serves on the PSV board, believes De Bruyne is better than their own star Memphis Depay.

He said: 'Everyone in the Netherlands adores Memphis Depay but then I calm them by saying that Kevin De Bruyne is doubly good. He is not the perfect No 10, nor the ideal winger, but I think De Bruyne currently is the most complete midfielder in the world.

'Even among the three best clubs in the world at the moment - Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - he would be a starter. Why not? Tackling, scoring, passing, running, fighting, he can do it all and he does it all with much flair.

'It is said that you do not win the Champions League with 11 Messis. But with 11 Kevin de Bruynes you will be very close to this.'

De Bruyne scored twice and set up Wolfsburg's other goal in their 3-1 first-leg win over Inter.
