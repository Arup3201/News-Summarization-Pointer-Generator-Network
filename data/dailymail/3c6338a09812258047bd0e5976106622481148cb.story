A Spanish artist has reinvented the traditional pointe shoe in order to capture a ballerina's movements and turn them into unique works of art. 

Using new technology, developed in collaboration with Lilypad Arduino, Lesia Trubat was able to turn a pair of ballet shoes into a digital paintbrush by fitting them with a device that allows her to track the dancer's every plié, point and arabesque.

The device, which is fitted directly to the shoes, then translates the ballerina's movements into a beautiful series of abstract digital images, using a specially-designed smartphone app.

'Dancers can interpret their own movements and correct them or compare them with the movements of other dancers,' Lesia said of her 'E-Traces' project.

'Graphs created with motion may be the same or different depending on the type of movements executed and the correction of the steps and body position.

'The concept of Electronic Traces is based on capturing dance movements and transforming them into visual sensations through the use of new technologies. 

'To do this we focused on the ballet shoes themselves, which through the contact with the ground, and thanks to Lilypad Arduino technology, record the pressure and movement of the dancer's feet and send a signal to an electronic device.' 

Although the artist has thus far only experimented with the movements of a ballerina, she is confident that the technology can be used with any any form of expressive motion. 

'This is a project that can be extrapolated to other dance disciplines and the applications are multiple, from self- learning or dance classes to the graphical representation of live performance,' she explains on her website.

'Dance is an art that disappears': The project allows dancers to keep a long-lasting memory of their movement

It is not the first time that Lesia, who confesses that she has always been 'captivated' by dance, has used ballet as a means of creating art.

Last year, the artist worked on a similar project, entitled 'Traces, memories of dance', which mapped the movements of a group of ballet dancers using a number of different mediums including ink and salt. 

'Dance is an art that disappears at the same time that is created, is an ephemeral art which only retain the memory,' she said at the time. 'TRACES captures these moments and turn them into haptics, visual and tactile sensations to those who buy the product.' 

The resulting artworks were used as part of Lesia's final degree project at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. 

Movement is art: Before testing out the new technology, Lesia also used a variety of physical mediums, including salt and ink, in order to capture a ballerina's motion
