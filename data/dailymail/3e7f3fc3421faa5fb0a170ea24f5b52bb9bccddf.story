Ministers were accused of effectively trying to bribe voters last night after showering cash on marginal seats.

The accusation came as they fanned out across the country to promote details of a new £36million investment in coastal areas.

Of the 28 identifiable constituencies receiving money, almost two-thirds are in marginal constituencies. Some 23 of the 28 seats are held by Coalition parties.

With 100 days to go, the election is not so much a phoney war as an endless series of photo opportunities for the parties. Yesterday, David Cameron and George Osborne helped out at a cider farm in Somerset (above)

In one case, Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb was dispatched to his own constituency in North Norfolk to announce a £500,000 grant to improve his local railway station.

Ministers also visited marginal seats in Lancashire, Kent and Devon.

Downing Street was also facing questions about why the taxpayer is picking up travel bills for David Cameron and George Osborne when they make campaign visits to marginal seats.

Labour Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Ashworth said ministers appeared to be pursuing ‘pork barrel politics’ – a reference to the US practice of effectively bribing voters by pouring money into marginal seats.

He said: ‘The Tories are pumping public cash into their electoral battlegrounds. We know that ministers are visiting key seats on official visits and ramping up advertising budgets in time for the election. 

‘Ministers need to come clean and justify this expenditure. 

'They must prove this is in the public interest, not just the electoral interest of the Tory Party.’

Downing Street yesterday denied the seaside grants and visits amounted to ‘electioneering’.

Meanwhile, Ed Miliband, who is keen to underline his emphasis on the NHS, visited a hospital in Warwickshire

The general election is just 100 days away and the coming days will see Mr Cameron (pictured left), Lib Dem Nick Clegg (centre) and Labour's Ed Miliband (right) battle it out on the campaign trail with their fellow parties

The NHS faces its most ‘perilous moment in a generation’ at May’s general election, Ed Miliband will warn today.

The Labour leader will say his is the only party which has pledged to increase health spending – from the proceeds of its controversial mansion tax – while the Tories want to make further public sector cuts.

Speaking at the first NHS hospital in Trafford, near Manchester, Mr Miliband will claim the Tories have caused a ‘crisis’ in the health service and that a second term for Prime Minister David Cameron could ‘leave it unrecognisable’.

A spokesman said: ‘The Coastal Communities fund is benefiting regions across the UK. 

'It’s important that the government is out there across the country today highlighting that.’

The Prime Minister and Chancellor are also facing mounting questions over their policy of mixing party and government events to ensure their travel bills are met by the taxpayer. 

Yesterday, for example, Mr Cameron made an ‘official’ visit to a rubber factory in Hampshire, before making a party political speech in nearby Southampton.

He then travelled to Somerset where he and George Osborne visited two top Tory target seats. 

Their ‘official’ business included a photo opportunity as they tipped apples into a cider-making machine.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘As a protected individual, travel costs for the Prime Minister are met by the government, other than exclusively political events or personal holidays.

'Where there are events organised by the party they are paid for by the party.’
