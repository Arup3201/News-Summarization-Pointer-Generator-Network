Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater steered his team to a rousing 41-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons but left the game in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury.

But X-rays came back negative with the Thursday night NFC North clash against the Green Bay Packers, who beat the Chicago Bears 38-17, looming large. 

Bridgewater appeared to be hurt while scrambling toward the end zone a play before Minnesota scored a touchdown to go 35-28 up. He remained in the game and threw a two-point conversion pass to Rhett Ellison before limping off.

Teddy Bridgewater was superb as the Vikings moved to 2-2  after a turbulent start to the season

Bridgewater rode a cart back to the locker room to get the ankle examined. In his first career start, the rookie completed 19 of 30 passes for 317 yards.

The injury thrust Christian Ponder back into action. Ponder is the only other healthy quarterback on the active roster after veteran Matt Cassel's season ended with a foot injury last week.
