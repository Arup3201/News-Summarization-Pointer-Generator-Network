It was once the scene of a brutal double murder of two brothers who were stabbed to death in their home.

Now this Sydney property is worth $2,265,000, after selling more than $200,000 above its reserve on Saturday with many potential buyers who were unfazed by its grim history.

The four-bedroom modern home went under the hammer for the first time since the cold-blooded attack five years ago.

The Sydney house, where two Frisolli brothers were murdered in 2009, sold for $2,265,000 on Saturday

The newly-renovated freestanding property has separate living areas, cathedral ceilings, timber floors, alfresco dining and a self-contained studio at the back.

The house in Sydney's inner west was one of almost 900 auctions yesterday, which marked the second biggest auction day of the year so far, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

The former home of brothers Albert and Mario Frisoli, slain in 2009, was purchased by a Byron Bay buyer.

Property developer Albert Frisoli and his brother Mario Frisoli were killed by Giuseppe Di Cianni.

Mr Di Cianni and Albert Frisoli had been in business together for several years before the murderer believed he was being defrauded.

During his trial, the Supreme Court heard that Mr Di Cianni disguised in women's clothing and entered the Frisoli brothers' home. He first stabbed Mario 21 times then waited two hours for Albert and killed him too.

Mr Di Cianni was sentenced to 30 years in jail last September.

His former lover Josephine Pintabona was also sentenced to at least three years for being an accessory after the fact of the killings.

It was a slow start to an opening bid of $1.9 million but three registered bidders took the the result well past the $2.05 million reserve at the on-site auction

There were 10 groups who showed active interested in the property at 17 Goodsir Street, Rozelle.

However three walked away from the sale once they heard about its tragic history while the other seven were undeterred by its past and six contracts were issued, according to BresicWhitney agent Adrian Oddi.

Although it was a slow start to an opening bid of $1.9 million, three registered bidders took the the result well past the $2.05 million reserve at the on-site auction.

It would have been marketed at $2.2 million-plus if the house had not been a crime scene.

The Byron Bay buyer was on the phone and represented at the auction by a BresicWhitney agent.

The property was sold by Mario's daughters, Albert's children and his de-facto partner Natasha Kourea.

'In spite of theâ€¦ tragedy that occurred at Goodsir Street, we still hold some very happy and memorable moments there,'  Mario's daughters Shannon and Erica said earlier this week.

'The home was full of fun and laughter, and pranks and games, and meals and discussions, and just normal family stuff, and we hope that whoever is lucky enough to secure the home - that it will give them lots of happy memories.'

As part of the material fact law, all prospective buyers of the Rozelle house were told about its history  once they showed interest. In this instance, details were also included on the contract of sale.
