British Bobsleigh has confirmed that two female team members have been involved in a crash during training in Germany.

Sorita Shone has undergone surgery after reportedly fracturing her spine and is described as stable after the accident on the Winterberg track, which is hosting the British Bobsleigh Championships.

The driver of the bobsleigh, Fiona Harrison, suffered a head injury and is in hospital for observation.

Performance director Gary Anderson told the BBC: 'I can confirm they were injured during a training run for the British Championships.

'Sorita has had spinal surgery and is still under sedation. My focus is now on the two athletes and their families.'

Ms Shone, 22, from Dorset, has recently joined the squad after switching from athletics, in which she competed in the heptathlon.

Ms Harrison, another former heptathlete from Barnsley, has been in the squad for two years.

The 29-year-old competed at the Europa Cup and World Cup and was in the women's squad at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Canada.

The British Bobsleigh Championships are being held at Winterberg, 100 miles east of Dusseldorf. It is one of 14 sanctioned by the governing body, FIBT, the BBC reported.

At the Winter Olympics in Canada last year, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili was killed after he lost control of his sled and crashed into a trackside pole at Whistler at 90mph.

Officials altered one of the bends at the track after the 21-year-old's death.
