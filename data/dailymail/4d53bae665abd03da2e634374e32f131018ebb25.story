Response: The former head of the CQC Cynthia Bower has denied being part of a cover-up by senior managers

The former head of the CQC has denied allegations that her management team ordered a cover up at a health trust where 16 babies and two mothers are suspected of dying through neglect saying, 'I feel I've been hung out to dry'.

Cynthia Bower, the former head of the NHS regulator, denies having backed an order by her then deputy Jill Finney, to delete a report which said they failed to investigate a health trust properly, back in 2011.

Police are considering whether to launch a formal investigation into the alleged cover-up by executives at the Care Quality Commission.

In an interview with The Independent, Ms Bower said she would welcome a police probe.

The 57-year-old, who resigned in February last year with a pension pot of £1.35m, said it would be a 'fairer and more reasonable process' than the report published by consultants Grant Thornton.

Up to 16 babies and two mothers are 
feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the 
maternity unit at Barrow-in-Furness general hospital, part of the 
University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay foundation trust.

Another nine infants were born with permanent brain damage.

The review found that despite multiple warnings about Morecambe Bay hospitals, a CQC inspection gave the trust the all-clear in 2010.

Even
when a CQC official produced a dossier showing the inspection was 
flawed, bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission’s 
reputation.

In the accounts
of a discussion between Ms Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson about what to do with the findings, Ms Jefferson is alleged to have said: 'Are you kidding me? This can never be in the 
public domain nor subject to a freedom of information request – read my 
lips.'

Jill Finney yesterday strenuously denied she had ordered the internal report to be deleted. She told the BBC they had not wanted it published because it was ‘not thorough enough’.

Ms Bower, who earned £200,000-a-year in her former role, told newspaper that she 'categorically denies' that an order to delete the report was made or that such words were used.

Quality of care: Up to 14 babies and two mothers may have died due to poor care since 2001, but the CQC gave the Barrow-in-Furness hospital a clean bill of health in 2010

The report was not deleted, but the 
Morecambe Bay trust was registered as 'compliant' in April 2011 and was 
given foundation status, despite concerns about the deaths of mothers 
and babies.

Asked 
what action that CQC had taken in response to the original internal 
review, Ms Bower said: 'Many changes were already in place. We had to 
learn on the job. At that point we were looking at changes in our 
methods.'

Ms Bower's name 
was initially kept out of the damning assessment made by Grant Thornton.
But the Government overturned legal advice not to name individuals 
because of data protection laws.

New CQC chief executive David Behan said
there was still a 'risk' that the organisation could be sued under data
protection laws but he believed publishing the information was in the 
public interest.

Denial: Media manager Anna Jefferson denies she ordered the critical report to be deleted

Ms Bower said she has been 'on the run' ever since her name was released into the public domain and confirmed she is 'taking legal advice'.

Ms Jefferson 
issued a statement last week insisting: 'I would never have conspired to 
cover up anything which could have led to a better understanding of what
went wrong in the regulation of this hospital and I am devastated that I
have been implicated in this way.

'This quote is
completely untrue. I cannot imagine why my manager would have put these words
in my mouth - and in fact she has since said she did not attribute this quote
to me.

'On the basis that the quote is false,
uncorroborated and has since been retracted, I am appalled that it appears in
the report.

'The thought of what the families who have lost
babies at this hospital have gone through is heartbreaking.'

The toxic order telling a CQC official to suppress his critical internal review was issued at a meeting on March 12 last year at the regulator’s London office.

Present with the official – named only as Mr J – in the Finsbury Tower building were chief executive Cynthia Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and a third senior official, whose identity is not known.

In the redacted report, commissioned by the CQC from consultants Grant Thornton, the three officials are identified as Mr E, Mr F and Mr G.

Grant Thornton does not say which letter relates to which individual, although it has confirmed that genders have been changed.

Mr J said Mr G ‘gave him an instruction to delete his report and that Mr E supported him in this, as did Mr F’.

The report continues: ‘According to Mr J, the reason for Mr G giving this instruction was that the report was damaging for the CQC and posed an “FOI” [freedom of information] risk.

‘Mr J claimed that Mr G said to him “Read my lips” when he gave him the instruction.’

Mr J produced a handwritten contemporaneous note of the meeting to support his allegations.

When Grant Thornton spoke to Mr G he was ‘somewhat equivocal’ about what had occurred.

At an initial interview he said ‘he was not sure’ whether there had been an instruction to destroy the report.

Questioned a second time, he claimed he could not remember as far back as March 2012.

When asked if he had instructed Mr J to delete the report , Mr G replied that he did not as ‘he would not have been authorised to do so’, which, says Grant Thornton, ‘was somewhat ambiguous, although preceded by a denial’.

Grant Thornton concluded that when given the chance to explain himself at two interviews Mr G ‘did not unequivocally deny’ giving the instruction.

Mr F was also ‘somewhat equivocal’. When asked if he recalled anyone giving an instruction to delete Mr J’s report his first answer was that he did not.

When asked a second time, he replied that he could not say whether the instruction was given but if it had been he could not think why he had not acted upon it, ‘which is not a denial that the instruction was given’.

Mr E’s answer was much more clear-cut. ‘He “had no recollection of the meeting but said that an instruction of that sort” would have stuck in his mind.’

None of the three produced notes of the meeting.

The report concluded: ‘Of the four accounts we were given during the course of the of our enquiries, we find Mr J’s version the most reliable.’
