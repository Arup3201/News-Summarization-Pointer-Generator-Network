Mrs May gets out of a BMW, one of the cars targeted by high-tech thieves 

One in three cars are stolen by high-tech hackers who do not even need the owner’s keys, the Home Secretary will warn today.

The sophisticated thieves are an example of the changing threats faced by police in 21st Century Britain, Theresa May will say.

She will highlight how gangs can break into a car and programme a new electronic key or use devices to ‘grab’ security coding when the owner uses their fob.

Experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite, issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up.

The latest figures from the Met, Britain’s largest police force, indicate that more than a third of vehicles stolen in the capital are not driven away using a key.

Many thefts do not involve any force with thieves instead driving away vehicles in as little as 10 seconds without causing any damage.

Mrs May will tell the independent Reform think tank that changing the way police tackle crime will not end at next year’s general election.

She will say that the three emergency services are likely to work ever more closely and that further cost cutting is inevitable.

Addressing the rise of high-tech car theft gangs, she will say that car manufacturers must work with police to understand the problem.

‘Car thieves might break into a car and programme a new electronic key. They might use sophisticated devices to ‘grab’ the security coding when the owner uses the key so they can use it themselves.

‘And there have been reports that they would even use malware to commandeer vehicle systems via satellites and issue remote demands to unlock doors, disable alarms and start car engines.

‘Because we have this understanding, we can now work with industry to improve electronic resilience … and work out the extent to which the same threat applies to other physical assets such as building security systems.’

Police suspect tens of thousands of cars are being stolen or broken into every year by thieves using electronic hacking equipment.

The trend threatens to destroy years of falling car crime figures as manufacturers create more secure vehicles.

Criminals are believed to have used high-tech gadgets originally designed for locksmiths to gain access to vehicles.

The most common ruse involves thieves intercepting the signals from key fobs to get into cars or plugging into a car's on-board computer.

Modern cars contain about 50 low-powered computers which criminals have learnt to take advantage of to steal vehicles in as little as 10 seconds.

Many devices can be bought cheaply online, often from websites based in Bulgaria. They are accompanied by video tutorials posted online.

The problem was first exposed several years ago in certain models, but police now suspect that all modern makes are potentially vulnerable.

The Met advises car owners to leave their cars in well-lit areas, to consider using steering, gear shift and pedal locks, as well as tracking devices.
