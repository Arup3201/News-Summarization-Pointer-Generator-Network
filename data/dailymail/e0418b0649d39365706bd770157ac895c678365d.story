An injured veteran of the war in Afghanistan was kicked out of a shopping mall for speeding on his Segway.

Master Sergeant Michael Trost was using the motorized, standing scooter to help him get around due to injuries he sustained while at war.

While serving in Afghanistan, Master Sgt. Trost was shot four times.

Devalued: Master Sgt. Michael Trost became a hero when he took four bullets for his country in Afghanistan, but was kicked out of a mall for riding a Segway that helped with his injuries

The Purple Heart recipient subsequently spent several months in the hospital recovering from his injuries and continues to experience chronic nerve pain in his legs that hinders his mobility.

‘If I walk long distances’ Trost told WATE, ‘my leg will start hurting. My sciatic nerve was severed, and I can't go long distances. I need to take a break.’

One way he can rest his legs is by using his Segway in favor of walking, but that was one breaking a mall security guard wasn’t willing to give.

As Trost made his way through the Foothills Mall in Maryville, Tennessee, a guard stopped him.

Ongoing: Trost's still experiences severe pain and is about to have another surgery to help him get around more easily

Pulled over: Despite his pleas and legal use of the Segway, the mall maintained Trost was 'speeding' and causing a hazard to other customers

‘[He] said I was going to have to take out the Segway,’ Trost said.

Trost says he explained to the guard that the device was for mobility. Most businesses are required by law to allow such mobility devices for the disabled.

In fact, the Foothills Mall policy explicitly allows Segways ‘inside the shopping center by people with disabilities’ but ‘they must be operated in a safe manner.’

It was the ‘safe manner’ part that Trost was then accused of disobeying.

There was no arguing the Segway, which carried a sticker officially designating it as a mobility device, was allowing in the mall, but the security guard claimed Trost was ‘speeding.’

Important: Trost denies he was speeding and says this issue affects all disabled people who require similar mobility devices

And according to the mall, the decision came down to "the safety and well-being of our shoppers."

Master Sgt. Frost continues to struggle with his health and says, at nearly 50, he has no desire to be disruptive.

‘In fact,’ he said, ‘in a few days, I'm going back up to Bethesda for surgery so the last thing I want to be is disruptive.’

Plenty of Americans would be appalled to hear of the war hero disrespectful experience, but was quick to point out that all disabled Americans and not just veterans are affected by these sorts of incidents.

‘This is not about me,’ he said. ‘This is about other people who also have ADA equipment.’
