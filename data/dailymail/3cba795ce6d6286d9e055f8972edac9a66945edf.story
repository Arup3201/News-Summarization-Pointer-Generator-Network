It's been a crazy few months since I last checked in on my Road to Rio. 

The Commonwealth Games were incredible. I wasn't selected for 3 metre individual despite making all the pre-requisites and retaining a spot in the top two for England. 

I really fancied my chances at a medal here, especially after a strong performance at the Olympics back in 2012, but for some reason they decided to put in for another event. 

I was selected for the 1 metre, which isn't what I usually do, but blessed with the opportunity to compete I gave it my best shot.

The event I was most looking forward to was the 3 metre synchronised with my new partner Jack Laugher. We now live and train together in Leeds and we had the determination and the belief that we'd be on that medal podium - and it paid off. 

My family, my girlfriend, management the team were there, and it felt great having England behind me. After narrowly missing out on a medal at the Delhi Commonwealths, it was insane to walk away with a gold medal this time round.

The end of August is always downtime. A bit like our summer holidays. It's five weeks where we can do what we want, eat what we want and we usually keep as far away from water as possible. 

I took this time to really push my music. I had a couple of gigs across the UK, including one in London which some of the team came along to watch, and then I headed out to Ibiza with a few of my best mates. 

I'd always wanted to experience the music scene out there. I had the opportunity to watch Avicii and a few other huge influences and generally just chill out.

I teamed up with the guys at Corona Sunsets too. They hosted an incredible evening of live music, cocktails on the beach and it was so nice to meet some of my music heroes.

After that, I headed out to Mexico. Diving is a massive sport out there and a large number of my followers on social media are out there, so with a few DJ sets booked across the country we headed out on a tour. 

First stop was Cancun. Insane white beaches and beautiful weather - it reminded me a bit of Miami. 

We then headed down the coast to Playa Del Carmen. Here we visited a theme park called Xcaret. The park is essentially a beginners guide to Mexico all in one park. Beautiful wildlife roams the park. Shows and spectacles, underwater natural rivers you can swim in, shark encounters, beaches and museums. It had the lot. If you're ever in the south of Mexico it's a must!

The rest of the trip was an amalgamation of gigs, press and media, orchestrated by the record label I'm working with - Universal Music. We spent a lot of time in Mexico City, where I collaborated with the British Embassy on a project to promote the relationship between the UK and Mexico in culture, sports and music. I also had the first radio play of my debut single, hung out with some fans, ate an awful lot of Mexican food and drunk a little bit of Tequila too. My favourite place was a beautiful city called Zacatecas.

We then flew on to Los Angeles. I'd heard loads about it, but knew within about five minutes of being out of the airport that I would live there some day.

There's such an incredible buzz about it, beautiful weather, an amazing sports and music scene and I met some great new friends.

Since then it's been a bit of a reality check. Back to hard work. As you can imagine the first few days back at training hurt so much but I've got a new weights plan, Jack and I are learning some new dives and I have some new focus for my individual work. 

We're really starting to look ahead to Rio now that the Commonwealths have been and gone. Preparation for next year's season is well underway too. 

There's plenty of travelling involved, which is made possible by National Lottery funding. It's tiring but an insane experience to share with the team. 

Away from the pool, awesome things are happening with my music and I can't wait for you to hear some of my stuff in the coming months.
