As Kate and William’s royal tour to Australia draws near, interest in the minute details of their schedule, childcare plans, and of course Kate’s wardrobe is reaching fever pitch.

A worldwide fashion icon, the Duchess’s wardrobe will be under even more scrutiny than usual as she embarks on her second official royal tour, seen by millions as an ambassador for British fashion.

As well as no doubt remaining loyal to some of her long standing favourite designers such as, Temperley, the 32-year-old has apparently also commissioned Ralph & Russo to design some of her pieces for the trip.

Kate, pictured performing her royal duties recently, has reportedly turned to Ralph & Russo for help with her hot anticipated wardrobe for the upcoming tour

The trip to Australia, which starts next week, marks the second official tour the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have undertaken on behalf of the Queen, and interest is high worldwide, especially as they will be joined by Prince George

Looking through the Ralph & Russo SS14 collection it is not hard to image Kate in many of the elegant designs

Grazia reports that a source confirms Kate has approached the designers, saying: ‘Kate visited Ralph & Russo’s boutique last month and said she was looking for inspiration for the tour.

‘She liked that they had Australian connections and has apparently given them specific instructions for a gown.’

The brand, which hit the news earlier this year when they became the first British designer ever to be welcomed into the official Couture Fashion Week in over 100 years, is sure to be a crowd pleasing choice for her upcoming tour down under, Ralph and Russo, despite being a British brand, was founded in 2007 by Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo.

And Kate will be in good company as the pair boast some serious A list clientele including Angelina Jolie and Beyonce, and their outfits have price-tags to match with a cocktail dress

Looking through the latest collection it is not hard to imagine Kate looking elegant in a number of their pieces, which included tailored skirt suits with Kate’s favoured cinched-in waist and breath-taking red carpet worthy gowns. 

However the commissioning of the designers marks a distinct change in direction for the Duchess, who is known for her love of high-street designers.

The designers have yet to make a ready-to-wear range and a bespoke gown can cost as much as £50,000

The Duchess, pictured here in 2012 at the third stop of the couple's nine-day tour of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, kept her look casual, wearing lots of high street brands as well as designer clothes

The Queen is apparently is keen to see Kate looking more regal on the upcoming tour, with longer hemlines and more jewels.

William and Kate’s 2012 tour of Asia saw Kate pairing British designers such as Alexander McQueen with plenty of high street favourites such as Russell & Bromley and Hobbs.

In contrast to her usual humble fashion tastes, Ralph & Russo represent the very top end of design, having never in fact produced a ready-to-wear range, focusing instead on custom made pieces and couture collections.

Speaking to Vogue earlier this year Ralph said of their ethos: ‘We create an experience around the dress; we have a very personal relationship with each of our clients.

‘I have always loved the fantasy or fashion and it was important for me to focus on something I loved.’

The move up the fashion ladder may be prompted by the Queen, who apparently is keen to see Kate looking more regal on the upcoming tour, with longer hemlines and more jewels.
