They may look like ancient aliens, but these strange fossilised creatures are a distant relative of humans.

More than 100 years after they were discovered, experts have identified the fossils as vetulicolians – blind marine creatures that swam 500 million years ago.

They believe that the ancient animals are among humans’ distant cousins because they had a rod through their tail similar to a backbone.

This 500-million-year-old fossil has been used by Australian researchers to make their discovery about vetulicolians. These marine creatures had a rod through their tail similar to a backbone, which places them as distant cousins of vertebrate animals, they claim

Researchers at the University of Adelaide in Australia, explained that the marine creatures were 'filter-feeders' shaped like a figure-of-8.

Their strange anatomy has meant that no-one has been able to place them accurately on the tree of life, until now.

In a new paper published in BMC Evolutionary Biology, they argue that the alien-like animals should be placed within the same group that includes vertebrate animals, because of a ‘rod’ structure in their anatomy.

‘Although not directly related to humans in the evolutionary line, we can confirm that these ancient water creatures are among our distant cousins,’ said lead author of the paper, Dr Diego Garcia-Bellido, of the university's Environment Institute.

It may seem strange that a blind marine creature shaped like the number eight could be an ancient relative of humans.

But scientists say vetulicolians, which lived 500 million years ago, are a distant cousin of humans because they had a rod through their tails.

This rod resembles a notochord, which is the precursor of the backbone and is unique to vertebrates and their relatives.

This has lead experts to argue that the creatures should be placed within the same group that includes vertebrate animals, such as humans.

‘They are close relatives of vertebrates - animals with backbones, such as ourselves.

‘Vetulicolians have a long tail supported by a stiff rod. This rod resembles a notochord, which is the precursor of the backbone and is unique to vertebrates and their relatives,’ he said.

Although the first specimens were studied in 1911, it took until 1997 for the fossils to be described as a group on their own: the vetulicolians.

These fossils have now been discovered in countries all across the globe, such as Canada, Greenland, China and Australia.

The latest insights into vetulicolians have come from new fossils discovered on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia.

‘Vetulicolians are further evidence that life was very rich in diversity during the Cambrian period, in some aspects more than it is today, with many extra branches on the evolutionary tree,’ Dr Garcia-Bellido said.

‘They were simple yet successful creatures, large in number and in distribution across the globe, and one of the first representatives of our cousins, which include sea squirts and salps.’

In the evolutionary tree, Australian researchers have now grouped the mysterious, extinct creatures known as vetulicolians on a branch alongside vertebrate animals. Although not in the same direct evolutionary line, this places the 500-million-year-old marine creatures as distant cousins of humans
