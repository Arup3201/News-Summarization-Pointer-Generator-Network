England are unlikely to retreat to a monastery again if they fail to beat Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday night, even though you might think Roy Hodgson and his players would need a little divine intervention to qualify from Group D.

Worry not. They were in a tighter corner than this and reached the quarter-finals at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico when, ultimately, the Hand of God was not quite so kind to them.

That was the last time England lost their opening group fixture, going down 1-0 to Portugal in Monterrey.

It went from bad to worse in the second game when captain Bryan Robson dislocated his shoulder and Ray Wilkins was sent off for throwing the ball at the referee in the first half of a goalless draw against eventual group winners Morocco.

‘It was clear the balance wasn’t right in the team,’ said Peter Reid, one of four players called into the starting line-up for the make-or-break encounter with Poland.

‘Where we were in Monterrey, it was like a desert and Bobby Robson decided to take us up into the hills to a monastery for a team meeting.

‘We had a frank and open chat where everyone gave a view on what was wrong or right. Peter Shilton spoke up and said his piece and I suggested a few things to Bobby, too.

‘He took it all on board and then came up with a system to put Trevor Steven on the right, Steve Hodge on the left and Peter Beardsley in the hole playing off Gary Lineker. I came in alongside Glenn Hoddle and it all seemed to fit in training.

‘We didn’t have the extra social media to contend with, like today’s players. But we knew from being able to get the BBC and through messages relayed from home that the pressure was on and people had been disappointed by what they’d seen.

‘We expected as much  anyway but it helped us grow very focused. The win was everything.

‘The players who weren’t playing like Mark Hateley and John Barnes were really getting behind the lads who were picked and we developed not just a good team spirit but squad spirit, a real unity. That was vital.’

What followed was one of England’s greatest World Cup performances. The partnership of Lineker and Beardsley blossomed immediately, Lineker bagging a first-half hat-trick as Robson’s new-look team blew away the Poles and pipped their opponents to second place on goal difference.

The situation in Brazil is not as serious — yet — after the opening defeat by Italy in Manaus last Saturday but Hodgson is already facing calls to drop Wayne Rooney or switch him from the left to a more central role against Uruguay.

‘I suppose there are a few similarities in how the current team shapes up,’ added Reid.

‘Firstly, I think our two top  players — Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney — need to turn up for the party and step up their game.

‘As good as  Andrea Pirlo is, I  still think Steven should have dominated him better and will want to impose himself on  Uruguay with more potency.

‘You couldn’t wish to set up a better goal than the one Rooney put on for Daniel  Sturridge, but he would benefit from playing in that Beardsley role rather than left wing.

‘England didn’t do an awful lot wrong against Italy and there’s no doubt they have enough to beat Uruguay.

‘They can’t afford to lose and focusing the mind on needing to win may give them the extra push they need.’
