The family of a young mother who was stabbed to death after the 999 emergency system failed her are seeking a landmark ruling over the right to claim damages for police negligence.

Joanna Michael, 25, made two desperate calls to the emergency service before being murdered by her ex-boyfriend Cyron Williams, 19, in August 2009.

But 'individual and systemic failures' by the police meant the emergency services arrived too late to save her life, the Supreme Court was told.

Joanna Michael's family is suing police for negligence after they failed to respond to her calls for help quickly; she was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in August 2009 while she waiting for police to arrive

Ms Michael, from St Mellons, Cardiff, was heard screaming during her second call to police before the line went dead.

The Independent Police Complaints 
Commission has already ruled Ms Michael was failed by both the Gwet and 
South Wales police as well as the 999 system.

The commission said officers should have 
been able to respond to her call within five minutes. By the time they 
arrived at her home 22 minutes later she was dead, having been stabbed 
72 times.

Cyron Williams, 19, was jailed for life for murdering Ms Michael by stabbing her 72 times in a 'jealous rage'

The highest court in the land is hearing a challenge by Ms Michael's family against a Court of Appeal ruling in 2012 that the police have an 'immunity' from being sued for negligence under the common law for the actions of officers during 'the investigation or suppression of crime'.

At the same time, the chief constables of South Wales and Gwent Police are cross-appealing against the appeal judges' linked ruling that the family should be allowed to go ahead with a claim that their Article 2 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights were breached by a police failure to protect Ms Michael's life.

Nicholas Bowen QC, appearing for Ms Michael's family, said the case was 'desperately important', particularly with regard to cases of domestic violence.

He told seven Supreme Court justices: 'There is a need for a heightened accountability of the police in the light of recent scandals and investigations which have had a very serious detrimental affect on public and political confidence in police services.'

Mr Bowen said the family's claim was 'not just about money' but also a 'determination to find out really and truly what happened'.

Williams attacked Ms Michael, whose children were home at the time, after breaking into her house 'in a mad fit of jealous rage' after discovering she was in a new relationship just weeks after they had broken up.

The court heard that Ms Michael made her first 999 call on a mobile phone at 2.29am and told the Gwent Police operator that Williams had come to the house and found her with someone else.

He had bitten her ear hard and taken the other man away in his car - saying he would return to kill her.

Ms Michael, 25, called police twice and was heard screaming before the phone went dead. She made it clear her life was in danger but police didn't appreciate the urgency of the situation. She was dead when they arrived

Mr Bowen said the 'urgency was absolutely plain' and an immediate response could have meant police reaching her in five minutes. But the call had gone through Gwent - 'the wrong police force' - and not South Wales, as it should have done.

The Gwent operator told the mother-of-two to 'stay put' in the house and keep the phone free as South Wales Police would want to call her back, said Mr Bowen.

According to the appeal court judgment, the Gwent operator spoke to her South Wales Police counterpart and said Williams had threatened to return to 'hit' Joanna but did not refer to 'the threat to kill'.

The call should have continued to be graded as requiring an immediate response, but was instead downgraded.

A further 999 call was received by Gwent Police from Ms Michael at 2.43am and she could be heard screaming before the line went dead. Police officers arrived at 2.51am to find her dead.

Williams was sentenced to life in jail in 2010 after admitting murder at the Cardiff Crown Court.

Mr Bowen told the court that the 'factual picture' revealed there were 'crucial legal duties owed to Ms Michael's estate by the police'.

He argued officers had failed to arrive in time and possibly save her life because of unacceptable delays. These were caused by individual and systemic errors of the police which justified them having to face damages claims for negligence, he said.

Ms Michael's family are being supported by Welsh Women's Aid and the charity Liberty.

Director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti said: 'Joanna could be alive if the authorities had fulfilled their duties under the Human Rights Act.

'They canâ€™t be allowed to hide such failings under the cloak of police immunity.'
