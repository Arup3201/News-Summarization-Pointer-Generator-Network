A woman accused of trying to kill her mother by spiking her Diet Coke admitted thinking about killing her after she was beaten and slapped during a violent row.

Kuntal Patel, 37, is accused of putting the deadly poison abrin in her mother Meena’s drink in a murder plot inspired by TV series Breaking Bad.

She told jurors yesterday she had felt like an ‘overweight buffalo’ and never had a boyfriend before she fell in love with a man from an Asian dating website.

But after she was forced to call off the wedding, the graphic designer said she had hit ‘rock bottom’ and considered killing herself and her 60-year-old magistrate mother.

Patel said: ‘I was having thoughts about killing myself, and I have to tell you that I also had thoughts – and I can’t believe I’m going to say this – about killing my mother,’ she told Southwark Crown Court.

‘I know it’s a terrible thing and I feel ashamed for having those thoughts. I was in a really bad mental state of mind. I couldn’t cope. I was researching these websites constantly to the point where I became obsessed with doing research on it. It was all I thought about.’

Patel, who worked for Barclays in Canary Wharf, lived with her mother and sister in Plaistow, East London, and was from a strict Gujarati background.

Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard Patel (pictured in a court sketch) describe how her mother started 'slapping her on and off' after growing bitter about the relationship

Role: Mrs Patel, a magistrate who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London, drank the poison last December, but survived

Her mother kept tabs on her movements ‘24/7’ and was ‘controlling’ towards her daughters. Patel said she was unhappy about her looks and had confided to a friend that she felt like an ‘overweight buffalo’ and had never had a boyfriend. She turned to Asian dating website Shaadi.com to find a man she could marry and have children with.

She met IT worker Niraj Kakad, from Arizona, US, and the pair made plans to marry. But her mother, who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court, did not accept him and allegedly called him a ‘fat, black b******’ and her daughter a ‘f*****-up-brain girl who can’t be my blood’ for falling for him.

At this point, her mother started beating her and slapping her, the court heard.

Peter Rowlands, defending, asked Patel how she would have felt if she had killed her mother.

She replied: ‘I would be lost and I would be devastated and, to be honest, I probably would have ended up killing myself too. It was just thoughts I was having in my head.’

Last December, she allegedly bought abrin off the ‘dark web’ and slipped it into her mother’s drink. But her mother survived.

Patel told the court she became ‘addicted’ to the hit US series Breaking Bad in which one of the characters is killed off with the poison ricin.

She said: ‘I was watching one a day. I became addicted to it.’

Abrin is more poisonous than ricin, the court heard.

Patel, denies trying to murder her mother and acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She has pleaded guilty to attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin last December. The trial continues.
