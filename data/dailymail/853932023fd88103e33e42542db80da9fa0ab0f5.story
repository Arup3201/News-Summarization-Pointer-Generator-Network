A 51-year-old Australian woman could face the death penalty in Malaysia after being arrested for drug smuggling.

She was allegedly found with 1.5kg of methamphetamine – also known as ice – at Kuala Lumpur airport during a stopover.

The woman, believed to be a mother-of-four, was travelling from Shanghai to Melbourne,Seven News reported.

The arrest follows the release of 22-year-old Australian Kalynda Davis who was arrested in China on drug smuggling charges earlier this month.

Miss Davis faced execution by firing squad along with New Zealander Peter Gardner for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Australia from China.

While Miss Davis returned home to Sydney earlier this week, Mr Gardner remains in Chinese custody.

The 51-year-old woman is due to appear in court on Sunday.
