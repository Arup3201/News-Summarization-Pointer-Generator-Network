Congressman Michael Grimm has been charged with 20 criminal counts addressing different fraud allegations after turning himself in to FBI headquarters in Manhattan on Monday morning.

The Republican representative from Staten Island has entered a not guilty plea to a U.S. Magistrate in connection to all 20 counts which include several fraud charges relating to a health food store that he ran before running for Congress.

He is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and tax fraud, all of which are connected to his involvement in an Upper East Side restaurant where he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010.

The lengthy indictment charges Grimm with two different types of fraud- mail and wire- as well as obstruction of justice, perjury, employing illegal immigrants, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

Facing charges: Congressman Michael Grimm turned himself in to the FBI this morning (pictured) after it became clear that they will be filing charges against him in connection to a restaurant he was involved in before being elected to Congress

The bulk of the crimes themselves took
 place before he was a Congressman, and he is accused of concealing more
 than $1million in receipts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars
 that were kept away from employees.

While helping run the Manhattan restaurant, Healthalicious, Grimm is accused of keeping two sets of payroll records.

The one he turned over to the restaurant's accountants, who used them as the basis for their tax returns, showed lower payouts to employees than he was actually paying them- as he opted for cash payouts of either half or all of their earnings so that there was no trail.

The perjury charge, however, comes from a deposition in January 2013 where he allegedly lied under oath.  

Past practices: Grimm, 44, has been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee since the fall pertaining to his campaign fundraising practices but today's charges are expected to be unrelated (pictured in January)

Laying out their case: U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch is one of the prosecutors who came up with the 20 counts that Grimm now faces, focusing the investigation on his time before running for office

Dirty dealings: The prosecutors looked into his involvement with a health food restaurant on the Upper East Side called Healthalicious after former employees complained of getting less than minimal wage

The deposition came when former employees accused Grimm of paying them less than minimum wage.

During that meeting, he reportedly said that he did not pay them in cash nor did he have access to an email account that investigators have linked him to.

'Rep. Grimm billed himself as a patriot and an American hero... but Rep. Grimm was anything but an upstanding citizen. He cheated, evaded and then lied,' said the head of the FBI's New York office George Venizelos.

Grimm, 44, is familiar with the FBI headquarters as he worked for the agency for more than a decade before leaving in 2006.

'As
 a former F.B.I. agent, Representative Grimm should understand the 
motto: fidelity, bravery and integrity,'  F.B.I. assistant director 
George Venizelos said in a statement.

'Yet
 he broke our credo at nearly every turn. In this 20-count indictment, 
Representative Grimm lived by a new motto: fraud, perjury and 
obstruction.'

Grimm was expected to turn himself in 
at some point this morning, and the news of the Congressman's appearance
 at the lower Manhattan headquarters was reported shortly after 8am.

His case: The Republican congressman has been released on bond after entering a not guilty plea

To many, 
his involvement with the restaurant was not the most expected source of 
his legal troubles, as Grimm has been under investigation for months for
 questionable fundraising practices relating to his congressional 
campaigns.

Grimm and his lawyers have maintained his innocence throughout.

The restaurant was reportedly fined $88,000 for failing to adequately pay workers according to state wage laws.

Last
 week, Grimm's lawyer William McGinley made it clear that the 
Congressman and his staff were well aware that federal prosecutors 
intended to file criminal charges against him.

'We
 are disappointed by the government's decision, but hardly surprised. 
From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven 
vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the
 truth,' Mr McGinley said.

Connections: Grimm was an investor in this Upper East Side health food restaurant and someone related to the restaurant is believed to be the connection between the Congressman and his alleged campaign finance issues

'After
 more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, 
violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. 
Attorney's Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges 
against Congressman.

'Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing. When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.'

The
 House Ethics Committee publicly announced their investigation into 
Grimm in the fall, stemming from the donations he received from 
followers of an Israeli rabbi named Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto.

Rabbi Pinto is believed to be one of the ten wealthiest rabbis in Israel though his base of global operations is New York.

Grimm's
 team admitted that their campaign received between $250,000 and 
$300,000 from the rabbi's supporters- some of whom admitted to making 
tens of thousands of illegal contributions.

Investigation: Diana Drumond (right) who was previously in a romantic relationship with Grimm (left) was charged on Friday with lying to the FBI and making up false donors to illegally funnel his campaign money

Ofer Biton, who was the liason between Grimm and the rabbi's followers, pled guilty to an immigration fraud case in August and then three days later, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint against one of Grimm's former lovers for using straw donors to make illegal contributions.

That woman, Diana Durand, was charged on Friday in relation to those accusations as well as an additional charge of making false statements to the FBI.

The issue has been a sensitive one for the Republican, who was elected into office at the height of the Tea Party and relied heavily on the group's support during the 2010 race.

He came under fire following the State of the Union this year when a reporter asked him about the campaign contribution investigation on camera. Grimm stormed off before returning and threatening to 'break (the reporter) in half' if he ever asked about the situation again.
