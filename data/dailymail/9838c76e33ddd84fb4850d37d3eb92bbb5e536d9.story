The introduction of the new unleaded petrol, called E10, could have alarming consequences for motorists

Britain’s transport minister has asked oil giants to delay introducing a new ‘green’ petrol that could put up the cost of driving and even damage older cars.

The Daily Mail revealed yesterday how plans to introduce the new unleaded petrol, which is called E10, could have alarming consequences.

Estimates suggest it could add around £80 to the annual driving costs of a family and might even cause some components on the engines of older cars to melt.

Transport minister, Norman Baker, is particularly worried about the impact on poorer families who tend to drive older cars.

UK petrol companies are planning to introduce the new fuel, which contains 10per cent ethanol created from corn, later this year.

The firms are required to start selling the ‘green’ petrol under EU directives requiring them to increase the amount of biofuel they sell or face large fines.

The idea is that this will reduce the use of fossil fuels and the resulting creation of greenhouse gasses linked to global warming.

Britain’s Department for Transport (DfT) has calculated that the new fuel is not compatible with as many as 8.6million older vehicles on the roads in this country.

The high ethanol content means the fuel could effectively melt seals and components in the engines of older cars, motor cycles and even lawnmowers.

Significantly, a study published by the respected think-tank Chatham House, points out that E10 petrol is less efficient that standard petrol, which means drivers do fewer miles to the gallon.

The net effect is that a family driving 10,000 miles a year will end up buying more fuel and paying around £80 a year extra if they use E10.

In theory, oil companies could introduce E10 at any time that suits them, however Mr Baker has asked them to delay.

E10 will be sold from pumps alongside E5, which is 5per cent ethanol and compatible with all petrol engines, standard unleaded petrol and diesel.

Mr Baker is particularly concerned about the impact of the new fuel on poorer families who tend to drive older cars. They may find the engines fail if they inadvertently use the E10.

Ministers wants the oil firms involved to give the government at least three months’ notice of any move to sell the fuel.

In the meantime, DfT officials are drawing up a public education campaign about the new fuel and compiling a database of vehicles that are not compatible, which would be made available to drivers.

Significantly, the UK government has no legal powers to stop petrol suppliers from launching E10 here.

Mr Baker said: ‘I have made it clear to fuel suppliers that we would like them to delay supplying E10 until the number of incompatible vehicles has reduced and the market is ready.

‘I am particularly conscious that it is often poorer people with older cars who may be particularly affected.

‘Although it is ultimately a commercial decision, we believe this is the right approach to minimise the impact on hard-pressed families.’

Quentin Wilson, of FairFuelUK, said the government has the power to mitigate the increase costs of using E10.

‘The government should protect the motorists from any increase in the cost of motoring caused by the introduction of E10 by cutting the rate of duty. Currently, the combination of duty and VAT, means the tax on fuel is about 80p a litre,’ he said.

Suppliers, such as BP, Shell and Total, are working on the introduction of E10 petrol through a body called the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP).

BP said it would not disclose the details of discussions with politicians about the timing of the introduction of E10.

A spokesman said: ‘EU member states are committed to increasing the amount of biofuels in the fuel mix by 2020 as a means to using more renewable energy.

‘BP is working with industry on a wide range of measures to ensure that our customers will be properly informed well in advance of any future changes to our products.’

Shell referred calls to LowCVP, which said it had no date for the introduction of E10. The organisation will co-ordinate a public information campaign when the fuel is launched in the UK.

E10 was launched in Germany two years ago, however most motorists have refused to use it amid fears it might damage their cars.

A spokesman for LowCVP said: ‘We are trying to make sure that as and when it is introduced, that happens without the problems seen elsewhere. There will be a database showing which cars can and can’t use it.’

It is difficult to find reliable figures on the number of vehicles that are not compatible with E10. A Department for Transport study published in 2010 put the figure at 8.6million and predicted this would fall to around 4.3m by 2013.

Motor industry estimates suggest some two million vehicles are known to be incompatible, and a further one million might be. There is also an unknown number of motorcycles, power tools and ride-on lawnmowers that will also be incompatible with E10.
