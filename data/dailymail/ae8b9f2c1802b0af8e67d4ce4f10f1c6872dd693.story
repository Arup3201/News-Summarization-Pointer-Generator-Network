Rough state: Ice Road Truckers star Tim Zickuhr was arrested in December and pictured here after being taken to the Las Vegas police department

A star of a reality trucking show has been charged with kidnapping a Las Vegas prostitute and threatening to kill her.

Tim Zickuhr now faces three felony charges after threatening and attacking a prostitute who went by the name 'Snow White'.

His mugshot, which was taken in December immediately following the arrest but only released on Tuesday, shows that the 40-year-old has bruises or dirt all over the sides of his face.

TMZ reports that he attacked the unidentified prostitute after accusing the woman of taking too much money out of his debit account after he gave her his ATM card to pay for an evening with her.

Zickuhr joined the History Channel 
show in its second season, which filmed in 2011, and was sent to drive 
cargo across some of the scariest roads in Bolivia.

The
 show went off the air after that season and he has since returned to 
the United States- and was in Las Vegas on the night of December 18 when
 he had a tryst with the prostitute.

TMZ
 reports that the pair met that night and she claims that he gave her 
his ATM card so that she could withdraw an undisclosed amount for her 
payment.

Charged: Tim Zickuhr was arrested for kidnapping, extortion and coercion following a December 19 incident when he attacked a prostitute in Las Vegas

He later accused her of taking too much from the account but she agreed to come back and meet him the following day to settle the dispute.

As soon as she walked into his apartment on December 19, he punched her and said that he would kill her if she didn't get him the money.Â 

During the attack, he allegedly used backpack straps to tie her up and then poured cold water over her head from a bucket.

She continued to deny that she took 
any extra money from him, but he gave her a phone and forced her to call
 someone who would be able to get him the $1,000 he accused her of 
stealing.

She cleverly 
thought to dial a police officer friend of hers and Zickuhr is said to 
have ripped the phone out of her hand and threatened him into meeting.

Aggressive: Zickuhr allegedly tied the prostitute up, punched her and doused her with cold water before threatening her life

Zickuhr pushed the woman out a second-floor window as they headed to the meeting, and as soon as they arrive, the officer friend arrested Zickuhr.

TMZ claims that Zickuhr 'sang like a canary' and admitted to the threats and violence.

He now faces first degree kidnapping, extortion and coercion charges and will be back in court in May.
