Newcastle stand-in skipper Moussa Sissoko is facing disciplinary action after he was sent off following a reckless challenge on Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva during Monday's 2-0 defeat at Anfield.

The France international was given a second yellow card for the offence, but head coach John Carver feels it should have been a straight red.

'The club will deal with that situation,' he said when asked if Sissoko - who is now banned for two matches - would be punished.

'He knows he was wrong. He was fortunate not to get a straight red and he agreed with me.

'He apologised afterwards to Lucas, which was important.

'But you think captains would lead by example. We have to improve our discipline. I will be looking at that.'

Meanwhile, Carver says Newcastle cannot rely on the shortcomings of others to preserve their Premier League status.

The Magpies are the division's most out-of-form side having lost five on the spin, scoring just one goal along the way.

They are nine points clear of danger with six matches to play, but Carver says it's about time they started helping themselves, starting with Sunday's visit of Spurs.

'These two home games (Spurs followed by Swansea) are massive for us. I'm not bothered about performances, we need results,' he said.

'I'm not worrying about that (relegation) at the moment, and the good thing is we have four games at home.

'But we need to start winning now. We can't rely on others teams. We can't afford to ease off, I have always said that.

'We have gone through a rough spell. It's down to me now to get players in right frame of mind.'
