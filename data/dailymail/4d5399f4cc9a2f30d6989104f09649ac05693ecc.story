Pubs in London have begun to serve horse meat burgers - and found them to be a huge hit with customers.

One pub said demand is so high that it is selling more than 100 in a week. The scandal of horse being labelled as beef has actually helped increase demand for the meat.

The Lord Nelson in Southwark introduced the dish a fortnight ago, while The Three Compasses in Hackney began grilling 100 per cent horse meat burgers earlier this week.

The Three Compasses serves the patties with black pepper mayonnaise, onion, lettuce, pickles, Emmental cheese, ketchup and a fried egg.

Chef Michael Brown - who described the taste as ‘very much like beef in texture and ever so slightly gamey’ - said 50 burgers sold out in hours on Tuesday night.

Owner Lauren Johns said: ‘All across Europe, horse is considered a high-quality meat.

We thought it’d be nice for people to try it and realise it’s really nice if prepared and sourced properly.”

There are four sizes of burger named on an equine theme, from the 2oz taster-size Shetland at £4 to the £11 Triple Trojan. The meat comes from France.

The Lord Nelson serves 8oz burgers with mushrooms and onions for £11. Extra toppings include goats’ cheese, brie and jalapeno peppers. It reported selling more than 100 in a week.

Co-owner Benito Priolo said: ‘It’s leaner and denser than beef and points in the direction of liver.’

For £16, the pub serves the 50/50 Burger - which involves one burger each made from horse and beef.

*Traces of pork have been found in halal chicken sausages served in at least one primary school.

Pork DNA was found in a sample of sausages taken from St Mary’s Bryanston Square in West London.

The sausages were a menu choice in 15 primary schools. Westminster City council has now withdrawn the products.
