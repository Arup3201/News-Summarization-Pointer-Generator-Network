Flight simulators have come a long way since they were first dreamt up at the turn of the 20th century.

The first rudimentary designs quickly evolved from bizarre ‘rocking’ cockpits to the terrifyingly realistic simulators used today.  

Back in the 1950s, simulators were used to train pilots on some the most technically-challenging aircraft around.

The KC-97 flight simulator, built in 1953 was one of eleven ever made. Weighing in at nine tonnes and costing £520,000 ($853,000), the simulator took three technicians to maintain

Among other things, the KC-97 Stratotanker Simulator was used to perform a mid-air fuel transfer between aircraft.

Pilots would spend hours at the controls of this £520,000 ($853,000) simulator before they ever set foot in the real thing, according to a report in The Aviationist.

Its four analog computers had to be programmed before each training session via stacks of 'resistance cards' that dictated the behaviour of the simulator's 117 motor-driven resistors

The KC-97 Stratotanker was an aerial refueling tanker variant of the C-97 Stratofreighter

The USAF began operating the KC-97 in 1950 when it  purchased a total of 816  from Boeing.

The KC-97 used piston engines, fuelled by aviation gasoline, but it carried jet fuel for its refuelling mission.

The KC-97 saw service well into the Vietnam Conflict era. There were 888 C-97s built between 1951 and 1956, 814 of these were modified to KC-97 tankers.

Built in 1953, the KC-97 Stratotanker Simulator weighed a nine tonnes, required three technicians to operate and was one of only eleven ever made.

The simulator was crammed with a maze of dials, instruments, switches and other gears that would surround the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer.

According to a 1968 National Guard press release, it was used to familiarise flight crews with proper pre-flight checks including take-off procedures, emergency flight operating procedures and fuel management.

Its four analog computers had to be programmed before each training session via stacks of ‘resistance cards’ that dictated the behaviour of the simulator's 117 motor-driven resistors.

The 1968 release states that the ‘power equipment around the device generates enough heat each hour to warm two small homes.’

This simulator appears to have remained in operation as part of the 128th Air Refuelling Wing of the Air National Guard until the early 1970s.

The 128th Air Refuelling Wing still has a dedicated training simulator located on base, though now it is an digital, full motion KC-135R simulator made by Boeing.
