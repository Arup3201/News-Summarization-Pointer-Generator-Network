Colorado senator Ted Harvey has renewed calls for teachers to be armed in the wake of the shooting at Arapahoe High School where his son was on the debating team with the gunman

A Colorado senator whose son was on the school debating team with the Arapahoe High gunman says the shooting 'validated' the need for teachers to be armed.

Karl Pierson, 18, shot Claire Davis at point-blank range with a shotgun on December 13 in a rampage that officials said lasted just 80 seconds.

Two members of staff - one of whom was armed - have been hailed as heroes for preventing further fatalities after the shooter took his own life as they closed in on him.

But Republican state senator Ted Harvey, whose wife teaches in the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch, believes weapons-trained staff may have been able to respond even faster.

He told FoxNews.com:
 'It (the shooting) validated why I think an armed person in the school 
is a good thing.

'I don't want my wife and kids to be sitting ducks.'

Before
 the shooting, he failed in his attempt to pass a bill that would have 
enabled public school district boards to allow staff to carry concealed 
arms.

But he said this latest tragedy emphasised the need for the bill to go through.

Pierson entered the school with many 
rounds of ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails as well as a
 shotgun he had purchased legally at a retail store under Colorado law 
on December 6, authorities said.

Officials said Pierson had been kicked 
off the school's debate team, of which Harvey's son was a member, and 
apparently bore a grudge toward the team's coach.

The latest tragedy took place just a 
few miles from the sites of last year's Aurora cinema shooting that left
 12 people dead and scores wounded during a Batman movie screening and 
the 1999 Columbine bloodbath in which 13 were killed as well as the two 
student gunmen.

It also 
occurred just a day before the first anniversary of the Newtown, 
Connecticut shooting in which Adam Lanza gunned down 20 young children 
and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The
 Newtown attack briefly reignited the US gun control debate, triggered 
every time there is a major shooting, but attempts to pass tougher laws 
have made little headway in Congress.

Colorado
 has implemented a number of preventative measures from hotlines to 
drop-in centers meant to help intercept attacks sometime committed by 
the mentally ill, though the Arapahoe High shooter is not believed to 
have had any mental health problems.

Students will return to Arapahoe High School today for the first time since the shooting.
