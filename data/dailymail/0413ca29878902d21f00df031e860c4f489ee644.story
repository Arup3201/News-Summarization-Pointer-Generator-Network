Manchester City's Champions League hero Joe Hart has revealed he is on the verge of committing his long-term future to the club by signing a new contract.

The goalkeeper, 27, had a fine game in City’s 2-0 win in Rome on Wednesday that saw them through to the next round of the Champions League. And afterwards he revealed that a new contract with the club he joined from Shrewsbury in 2006 is now ready to be signed.

‘As far as I am aware it is pretty much sorted,’ said England’s No 1. ‘I leave it to the legal side to sort but I am very happy at this club and hopefully in the near future I will be signing that contract. How could I not be happy to stay? I love this place and I love everything about Manchester City.

‘I have been here for a long time. I feel like it is my club now and I want to be here as long as I can.’

With fellow Englishman James Milner, 28, also close to signing a new contract, news that two of Manuel Pellegrini’s most in-form players are on the verge of committing the best years of their careers to City will come as a huge boost ahead of Monday’s Champions League second-round draw. 

Hart certainly believes the big win in Rome could be a turning point for the club’s fortunes in Europe.

‘It was about time we did something like this,’ said Hart, who produced a string of superb saves to keep the scores level in the group-deciding win at the Stadio Olimpico. 

‘We can’t get away from the fact we started the campaign poorly but we have come good at the right time when we needed to and we have won the game.

‘We need to build on this. We got ourselves through last time and struggled against Barcelona so we have to look to go positive and see what we can do.’
