At least 15 children, were among 25 dead, after their school bus was caught in an Al Qaeda car bomb attack. 

The bus, carrying all female primary school pupils, was traveling near a Shiite run check point when the first of two car bombs exploded.

The second car exploded near the home of a Shiite militia - known as Houthis - who  was said to have been the target of the attack, AFP reported.

Medical sources confirmed that at least 15 children and 10 adults were killed in the blast in the town of Rada, south of the Yemini capital.

The Houthis are blaming the suicide bombs on Al-Qaeda militants calling it 'the ugliest crime against childhood.'

The defence ministry today condemned the 'cowardly terrorist attack on the home of a citizen and a school bus', and also said the Al-Qaeda responsible.

The Houthis and the Al-Qaeda have been fighting in Rada since October when the area was overtaken by the rebels. 

The bomb attack was the second to target Houthis in Rada just over a month.

On November 12, a suicide bomber killed dozens of people gathered at the residence of a tribal chief in Rada.
