Mario Balotelli is fighting for his Anfield future as Brendan Rodgers insisted he would not allow the striker to compromise Liverpool’s progress.

Once again Balotelli found himself commanding headlines for all the wrong reasons following Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid, given he had swapped shirts with opposition defender Pepe as he left the field at half-time.

It was a naive thing to do and Rodgers stressed that, having spoken to Balotelli in his office at Liverpool’s Melwood training base, the ‘matter was closed’ and had been dealt with internally.

There has been criticism from day one. It was a brave move by Brendan Rodgers. He obviously felt his managerial skills could stop the problem. It’s not worked for him or the club. This is his last chance at a big club in one of the big leagues and now he’s looking at Russia or somewhere like that.

He still has a future at Liverpool. The fans are some of the most patient but he has to realise he’s not playing at just any other club. He’s got to show his commitment by proving it on the pitch. You just don’t do what he did and I’m sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors.

On the Balotelli shirt-swapping furore: I doubt they’re having the same debate in Spain re Pepe. All is fine when you win. Can’t see the negative in half-time shirt swap. Does it affect the result? No.

JOEY BARTON

Balotelli getting a lot of criticism which is never going to help. What he needs is to get his head down and prove people wrong.

DIETMAR HAMANN

I think he would have angered Brendan Rodgers when he came into the dressing room wearing a Real Madrid shirt. I think Brendan had every reason to take him off, especially at 3-0 down. I think he did it on purpose. I think it was kind of premeditated. He doesn’t care.

MICHAEL OWEN

I’d still start Balotelli at the weekend. I’m not a big fan of his but he has more class than most. Harsh to put all the blame on him. Most worrying thing is his team-mates’ body language towards him. Once you lose their respect it’s a struggle.

If Liverpool were winning 3-0 at half-time, with Mario scoring two goals, there would be nothing said. Losing 3-0, playing poorly then slam Mario. I don’t agree with what he did but I also think he’s an easy target. Scapegoat springs to mind. 

But as the dust settled on the incident, the focus shifted to the more important matter of how he played against Madrid and the way he has performed since joining Liverpool in August and what he has done to justify a £16million transfer fee.

With only one goal in 10 appearances, patience is wearing thin as Balotelli has not provided Liverpool with a focal point and his form has been so underwhelming that Rodgers would not offer any guarantees about how long the 24-year-old may stay on Merseyside.

Balotelli signed a three-year deal when he arrived from AC Milan and while Rodgers insists he takes ‘full responsibility’ for the decision to bring him back to the Barclays Premier League, Liverpool’s manager will not be so stubborn that he persists with him if the experiment cannot work.

Rodgers said: ‘The manager always will be — and I certainly am — responsible for every player that comes in. So you don’t need to look too far. You can’t label it on me, so there is no problem there. I think it’s one which is very clear with the owners and the conversations we had.

‘We knew what we were getting. I said before this was a calculated risk to bring someone in and nothing has changed. I haven’t been overly surprised by many things. As I said, we took in a young player who has football potential.

‘Were we going to get that focus and concentration that is required to play consistently at the top the level? That is something that remains to be seen. And something that only time will tell. At this moment in time, he’s working hard to show he can deliver that.’

He added: ‘Whether Mario’s best is good enough longer term, that remains to be seen. He wants to score but, at the minute, he is not. When you are confident, you have more success. He is treated no different to any other player.’

It should be noted at this point that Balotelli — for all the noise that accompanies him — has not been a disruptive presence around the training ground and his behaviour has not been as madcap as it was when he was setting fireworks off in his bathroom during his spell with Manchester City.

When he arrived at the club, Balotelli was told what standards were expected of him but Rodgers will be hoping that his reported brush with the law is not the point at which things start to unravel for Baloteli at Anfield.

1. Stiffen Liverpool’s defence. One clean sheet in 18 matches and 19 goals conceded in 12 games is a dreadful return.

2. Sort out the goalkeeper. Between the sticks, Simon Mignolet has regressed in 2014 and looks bereft of confidence. His anxiety is spreading.

3. Where are the goals? Even after accounting for losing star striker Luis Suarez, Liverpool’s lack of cutting edge has been dismally apparent.

4. Find a balance. Manager Brendan Rodgers has regularly chopped and changed formations in games to get the right blend.

5 Get the top gun back. Striker Daniel Sturridge’s absence due to injury has dragged on and it is proving increasingly detrimental.

On the pitch he is certainly giving Rodgers — who is no closer to welcoming back striker Daniel Sturridge — problems. His play does not have the intensity that Rodgers demands of those he selects and the balance of the team therefore suffers when one part of the system is not functioning.

Many would be quick to say ‘we told you so’, as Balotelli could not flourish under managers such as Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini and Cesare Prandelli and Rodgers accepts he personally will be susceptible to criticism the Liverpool’s No 45 continues to underwhelm.

‘We brought in the player to give him a chance and give him every chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘At this moment in time, of course, he hasn’t scored the goals we would like or want. We are having to give him that opportunity. We will work with the players that we have and he is one of them.

‘It is not just about improving him. It is about improving all the players. And we will see come January what the team needs. I’m the type of manager that gives people an opportunity. I understand the criticism that will come my way because of that.

Balotelli, in action against the Spanish side on Wednesday, has failed to hit the heights since joining from Milan

The former Manchester City striker looked forlorn at Liverpool's Melwood training base on Thursday 

‘Like I said, you accept that as part of being a manager. You’ll take the praise if things go well with a player you are working with. And you have to take the responsibility as a manager too. Either way, I can deal with that.

‘He’s not uncontrollable. He’s certainly not that. He’s an individual talent who is working hard to try to fit into the team ethos here and the team identity. But only time will tell. He is working hard to try and understand what is required of a Liverpool player.’

For all that Balotelli is dominating the agenda, it is not the main issue vexing Rodgers. An inability to keep clean sheets is proving detrimental to their ambitions but, not only that, it was the comfort with which Madrid settled into the game that alarmed the manager. Liverpool looked flimsy — they only gave six fouls away — and two of the three goals they conceded were cheap.

‘I felt we could have been more competitive in certain situations,’ said Rodgers. ‘That is the mark of a champion. The mark of a champion is how you are competitive against the best opponents. It wasn’t through want of trying or work ethic. But it was an area we could have been better in.’
