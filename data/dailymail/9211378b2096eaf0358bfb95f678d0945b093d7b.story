A teenager has been left paralyzed after a freak hunting accident that saw a tow rope damage his spine.

Kevin Wayne Jr, 17, was watching a dead elk being pulled behind a truck when the rope attached to the animal suddenly snapped.

The teen, from Seattle, Washington, was hit across the neck by the rope, leaving him paralyzed and unable to speak.

Doctors fear the teen may never be able to walk again.

His parents have quit their jobs to be by their son's bedside as he struggles recover.

Friends have started a donation fund to help the family with their mounting medical bills.

The tragedy took place on October 18th while Wayne J was out hunting with a group of friends near Greenwater, Oregon.

After successfully felling one of the elk, the animal was attached to a truck with the rope suddenly snapping and lashing across the teen's neck.

'They were pulling the animal up the hill. It [the rope] snapped back and hit him in the back of the neck said the boyâ€™s mum Aurea Gonzales.

Wayne Jr. was airlifted to Harborview Medical Center for treatment.

He has undergone surgery on his neck and has shown the first sign of improvement - being able to move his arm.

Family member Teresa Gonzales said his parents didn't have jobs that provided health care benefits.

Teresa has started a donation page on the GoFundMe website.

In her appeal for donations she wrote: 'On Friday, October 18, my grand nephew, Kevin Wayne, Jr. was injured in a freak accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down and breathing with the help of a ventilator.

'October 24th was his 17th birthday. His parents are by his side 24/7 and both have had to leave their jobs.

'My niece and her partner, the mother and father, need financial assistance to get through this immediate crisis until a longer-term funding source can be established.

'Friends and family are exhausting their own resources to pay for gas, parking, food, etc. Any and all financial help is welcome.'

After several people made online donations she added: 'We are overwhelmed with your generosity.

'This is a sad and difficult time for us but your warmth and thoughtfulness is giving us the strength we need to carry on. This will be a long and difficult road.'
