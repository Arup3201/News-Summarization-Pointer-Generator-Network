The FBI increased a reward on Monday for helping to find an American ex-agent who disappeared in Iran eight years ago.

In a statement, the FBI said the U.S. government will pay up to $5 million for information that can help bring Robert Levinson home, up from $1 million. 

'We ask the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us on the investigation into Robert Levinson's disappearance so we can ensure his safe return,' Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.

The FBI increased a reward on Monday for helping to find Robert Levinson (seen left in 2010 and right before he went missing) who disappeared in Iran eight years ago

FBI Director James Comey said 'it is long past time for Bob to come home.' Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Iranian government to 'work cooperatively with us on the investigation.' 

The father of seven retired from the FBI in 1998. 

Levinson, disappeared from the Iranian resort of Kish Island on March 9, 2007, while on a business trip.

Friends of Levinson said that, around that time, he had been investigating the counterfeiting of cigarettes, though mainly in Latin America.

The FBI has been investigating Levinson's disappearance and the hunt has led them into Afghanistan and Pakistan - and back to Iran.

However, two Iranian presidents - including recently-elected moderate Hassan Rouhani - have denied having any involvement in his kidnapping or knowing where he is. 

An Associated Press investigation published in 2013 revealed that Levinson vanished while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence-gathering mission.  

Levinson had flown to the Iranian resort of Kish Island in March 2007 on CIA intelligence-gathering business when he was kidnapped

Levinson disappeared from Kish Island, an Iranian resort in the Persian Gulf. The Iranian government has repeatedly claimed that it has no idea where he is and was not responsible for his kidnapping

'Year after year, the family has endured the pain of his absence. It is time for him to come home,' Kerry wrote, also expressing concern for Levinson's health. 

In November 2010, a video surfaced in which Levinson asked for help in winning his freedom but did not say who was holding him or where he was. 

The Iranian government has repeatedly said it knows nothing about Levinson's disappearance or whereabouts.  

In 2013 Sen. John McCain said that ‘the CIA did not tell the truth to the Congress’ about Levinson.

McCain said he was confident the U.S. is doing all it can to learn what has happened to Levinson, but added he was disturbed the Obama administration has not been more forthcoming with information about him. 

Levinson was last seen in 2010 when his captors sent a video showing him holding several signs. He had lost weight and begged for help from the U.S. government

He said he didn't ‘think there's any doubt’ about whether Iran knows Levinson's fate. 

After he vanished, the CIA at first told lawmakers he had previously done contract work for the agency, but he had no current relationship with the agency and there was no connection to Iran.

However, in October 2007, Levinson's lawyer discovered emails in which Levinson told a CIA friend that he was working to develop a source with access to the Iranian government. 

The emails were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which touched off an internal CIA investigation.

Three veteran analysts were forced out of the CIA and seven others were disciplined as a result of a breach of agency rules.

The CIA paid Levinson's family $2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit, and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders. 

The last photos and video of a bearded, emaciated Levinson were released anonymously to his family in 2010 and early 2011. Investigators say his trail has grown cold since.

Top intelligence officials fear that he is dead.

Tuesday is Levinson's 67th birthday - if he remains alive, he has been held captive longer than any American, longer than AP journalist Terry Anderson, who was held more than six years in Beirut.
