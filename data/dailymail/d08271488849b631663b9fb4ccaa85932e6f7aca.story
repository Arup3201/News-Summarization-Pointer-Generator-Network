Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne has said lots of people 'feel they pay an awful lot more in than they ever get back' as suggestions emerged that Labour was planning a shift in its approach to welfare

Labour is planning a significant shift in its approach to welfare, suggestions have emerged.

Detailed work is under way on possible policy proposals that would mean the amount of benefit payments to those out of work or on low incomes would depend on their previous contributions, it has been reported.

Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has said
foreign migrants will have to live in Britain for a year before they 
can claim civil legal aid as part of reforms to save £300 million a 
year.

Labour was 
looking to revolutionise the system and address concerns it promotes a 
'something-for-nothing' culture, according to The Observer.

The paper has quoted a Labour party source saying: 'The problem at the moment is that you have a person aged 50 who has worked all his life and then becomes unemployed getting much the same as the person next door who has never worked. It is about linking what you take out to what you have put in.'

One idea under consideration is the 
creation of a payments system which provides higher benefits to those who 
have made more national insurance contributions after being in 
employment for longer.

Party 
sources have said the reforms would introduce greater fairness and 
create stronger incentives for people to work.

In an article for the newspaper shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'There are lots of people right now who feel they pay an awful lot more in than they ever get back. That should change.'

He also said councils will be allowed to prioritise housing 'to those who work and contribute to their community'.

Nobody would be able to be unemployed for more than two years - or one year for young people - under Labour's plans.

After this time they would be offered
a job funded by taxing bankers' bonuses and restructuring pension tax 
relief for the wealthiest. Those who did not take a job would lose their
benefits.

Labour's deputy leader today said it was understandable that workers felt 'resentful' about benefits claimants that do not want a job as the party attempted to reposition itself on welfare.

Labour is currently working on possible policy proposals that would mean benefit payments to those out of work or on low incomes would vary according to their past contributions, according to reports

Harriet Harman said it was 'not surprising' that people were concerned about the system but claimed the government's failure to install a proper work programme was letting some people 'off the hook'.

Ms Harman told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: 'The difficulty is for people who are in work, seeing their standard of living pressurised, understandably, they feel very resentful for people who are not working. For people who are looking for a job and can't find work it's deeply frustrating and then of course the small minority who don't want to work - well they are let off the hook by the fact there isn't a proper work programme.'

Ms Harman said the party was working up three principles on welfare ahead of the general election.She added: 'One, that work should pay, secondly, there should be obligation to take work and thirdly that there should be support through a contributory principle for people putting into the system as well as taking out.'

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has said foreign migrants will have to live in Britain for a year before they can claim civil legal aid as part of reforms to save £300 million a year

Announcing changes to the civil legal aid available for foreign migrants, Mr Grayling said some migrants were using the system to settle custody cases despite being in the country for 'extraordinarily short periods of time'.

He said the measures would be 'difficult but sensible' and insisted the move was 'not about denying people access to justice'.

In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph Mr Grayling said: 'There are a number of areas where somebody who comes to this country even on a tourist visa can access civil legal aid. We are going to change that.

'There have been examples of people who have come to the country for extraordinarily short periods of time who have had a relationship breakdown and then they end up in our courts at our expense to determine custody of the children.

'This will exclude people who enter the country illegally, who up to now have been able to access our legal aid system in a way I don't think should ever have happened.'

Mr Grayling also said he wants to curb the criminal legal aid bill, telling the newspaper nobody whose earnings came from the public sector 'should reasonably expect' to top the Prime Minister's £142,000 annual salary.

The package of measures being unveiled next week will stop prisoners using legal aid for cases that do not relate to the length of their sentences, according to the newspaper.

'I am proposing to take legal aid away from prisoners who don't like the prison they are in, or don't like the cell they are in, or don't like a part of the regime,' Mr Grayling told The Sunday Telegraph.

Meanwhile, Coalition benefit reforms are 'putting fairness back at the heart of Britain', David Cameron has insisted in a staunch defence of the controversial shake-up.

As the welfare state overhaul continues to fuel an increasingly bitter political row, the Prime Minister said the Government is on the side of 'each and every hardworking person in our country'.

Writing for The Sun, he suggested it was 'crazy' that claimants could have a bigger income on benefits than work and argued it is 'fair that we all play by the same rules'.

Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured last week visiting a swimming pool manufacturer in Witney, Oxfordshire) has said the Government is on the side of 'each and every hardworking person in our country'

Mr Cameron pledged to 'always help' the most vulnerable but insisted 'those who can, should' as he warned that the system was causing 'resentment' across the country.

In his article for The Sun he wrote: 'We are putting fairness back at the heart of Britain. We are building a country for those who work hard and want to get on. And we are saying to each and every hardworking person in our country: we are on your side.

An opinion poll has found six out of 10 voters believe benefits are too generous and 79 per cent back the Government's plan to cap a family's benefit at £26,000 a year.

The figures revealed most people believe at least half of claimants do not deserve any help and are not in genuine need.

The YouGov poll for The Sun today also suggests they believe families on low incomes are suffering at their expense.

According to the poll, 67 per cent of people think the system needs urgent reform.

'This is a Government for hardworking people: and that's the way it will stay.'

Over the last week widespread welfare and tax changes have come into force including a below inflation 1 per cent cap on working-age benefits and tax credit rises for three years.

Around 660,000 social housing tenants deemed to have a spare room will lose an average £14 a week in what critics have dubbed a 'bedroom tax' and trials are due to begin in four London boroughs of a £500-a-week cap on household benefits.

The welfare state debate became further inflamed over recent days after Chancellor George Osborne linked the case of child killer Mick Philpott to the coalition's benefit shake-up.

Mr Cameron said the system had 'lost its way' and had become a 'lifestyle choice for some'.

He wrote in The Sun: 'It was designed to bring us together, but is causing resentment. I think the British people are about the most fair and generous people on the planet - but no-one wants to work hard every day and see their hard-earned taxes being used to fund things they themselves cannot afford or keep generations dependent on welfare.

'So this month we are making some big changes. They are changes that have a simple principle at their heart: we are restoring the fairness that should lie at the very heart of our tax and welfare systems.'
