With her washboard stomach and perfect complexion, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the envy of girls worldwide.

But the seasoned model and Victoria's Secret Angel works hard to look as good as she does.

The 25-year-old gym and yoga fanatic has been following a strict health regime packed with organic foods and homemade smoothies and soups.

Supermodel: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the envy of women worldwide, and thanks to her regular Instagram updates everyone can now follow her healthy-eating habits

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Rosie revealed how she has recently avoided chocolatey treats and sugary Easter eggs, swapping them for healthy fruits, vegetables and homemade ingredients.

The model was quick to Instagram her efforts, sharing a photograph of herself slurping a smoothie with the caption: 'Rise and shine smoothie time.'

Super smoothie: The model often uploads snaps of herself slurping on smoothies and juices, which she describes as 'the perfect way to start the day'

The Devon-born beauty then asked her Instagram followers which of her two homemade smoothies they preferred.

She said: 'Juice lovers #greens #carrot&apple. Which would you prefer?'

She later uploaded a snap of her lunch - an organic homemade soup packed with split peas, carrots and celery.

Homemade: Rosie has become quite the whizz in the kitchen and cooked up a split pea organic soup and some fresh smoothies

'On the lunch Menu today - my delicious homemade Organic Vegetarian Soup #splitpeas #carrots #celery #garlic #onions #cumin #coconutoil #delicious!' she said.

Along with other super healthy ingredients such 
as cucumber, kale and parsley, Rosie often adds the Japanese wholefood Chlorella to her juices.

The superfood is an entirely natural green algae, which is linked to healthy nails, skin and 
hair.

And it isn't just a healthy diet that's helping the star stay in such good shape. She has recently been spotted hitting the gym on a regular basis, and judging by her fresh-faced glow, the health kick is paying off.

She works out: Rosie shows that looking this great requires a dedicated gym routine and healthy diet
