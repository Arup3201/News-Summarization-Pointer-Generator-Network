Michael Jackson reportedly lived in deplorable conditions inside Neverland Ranch. 

The New York Post spoke with his former housekeepers about the alleged filth.

A woman identified only as 'Maid No.1' told the newspaper, 'Michael sometimes ran around where the animals were, and he’d track... poop throughout the house and think nothing of it.

'Then, if you said something, he’d threaten to make doo-doo snowballs and throw it at you.'

On top of that, 'Maid No.1' claimed Jackson obsessively collected items, telling the newspaper that Jackson was '[a] pack rat.'

'Maid No. 2' told The Post that Jackson was in possession of 'A soiled baby's diaper, and a pair of Fruit of the Loom that was obviously worn by someone who was either a teen or an early-age adult.'

That housekeeper claimed to the newspaper Jackson disregarded sanitation and urinated in front of her the day after his 1993 Oprah interview.

'He literally peed on the floor of the entryway, right where you saw Oprah walk in,' she told The Post. ' It was surreal. He just stood there, unzipped his trousers and watered the floor.'

A third woman - 'Maid No.3' - told The Post Jackson's 'whole life changed after 1993 when he had to pay [Jordan Chandler] off [in a child molestation settlement].

'I'm telling you, he was the dirtiest, most unsanitary person in Hollywood.'

'Maid No. 3' also claimed to The Post that Jackson suffered a bed bug outbreak at his home.

'Everybody he brought in to clean, and sometimes we’d even get cleaning services to come in for the extra help. Everybody was repulsed. His bedroom smelled horrible. If everyone else was like me, they hated going in there,' she told The Post.
