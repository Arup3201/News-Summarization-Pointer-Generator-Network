Grapes in novel flavours like candyfloss have gone on sale in a leading High Street supermarket chain.

Waitrose is adding a new selection of exotic flavoured grapes including candyfloss, strawberry and mango to its fresh fruit line.

The strawberry  and candyfloss grapes are already on the shelves and the mango flavour grape will appear in shops in September.

The new range is expected to meet the increasing demand for new and interesting fruit flavours and follows Waitrose's launch of the Bubbleberry, a type of berry that tastes like bubblegum, earlier this year.

Sales of grapes in general are increasing by 17 per cent year on year but the unique varieties are showing the largest increase, says the store.

Waitrose grape buyer Greg Sehringer says that the new grape range is aimed at adults and children looking for something different in their fruit.

He said: 'We are thrilled to introduce this limited-edition range of exciting grape flavours that kids and adults will enjoy.

'Our customers are looking for something a little different so we have worked with our grape growers to create a whole host of new combinations. They look just like regular grapes but pack a surprising flavour punch.'
