Facebook has hit back at a controversial Princeton study that claimed it would 'die like a virus' and lose 80% of its users by 2015.

Researchers at the social network say the study is fatally flawed - and turned it on Princeton to prove their point.

Using the University's own method, it found Princeton would have no students by 2021.

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook CEO: the firm's researchers have hit back at a Princeton study which claimed it will lose 80% of its users by 2015.

The team from Princeton claim the social networking site spread 'like an infectious diseases.'

They predict its 'decline phase' has already begun - and will be swift, and used methods normally used to study the spread of disease.

'Extrapolating the best ﬁt model into the future suggests that Facebook will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years, losing 80% of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017,' they said.

'The site has 'already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase.'

To explain why social networks are like infectious diseases, the study pointed to similar research done with ideas.

'Ideas, like diseases, have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out, and have been successfully described with epidemiological model,' they say.

'Idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea, which can be thought of as the gain of “immunity” to the idea.'

Mike Develin, Lada Adamic, and Sean Taylor, of Facebook's data team, used the same methods as the original paper to show that Princeton was facing a decline in undergraduates of 50 per cent in the next four years and would have none at all by 2021.

'Like many of you, we were intrigued by a recent article by Princeton researchers predicting the imminent demise of Facebook,' they wrote.

'Of particular interest was the innovative use of Google search data to predict engagement trends, instead of studying the actual engagement trends.

'Using the same robust methodology featured in the paper, we attempted to find out more about this 'Princeton University' - and you won't believe what we found!

'In keeping with the scientific principle 'correlation equals causation,' our research unequivocally demonstrated that Princeton may be in danger of disappearing entirely.'

They also used the same logic to show the world will run out of air by 2060.

'We don’t really think Princeton or the world’s air supply is going anywhere soon,' they said.

'We love Princeton (and air).

'As data scientists, we wanted to give a fun reminder that not all research is created equal – and some methods of analysis lead to pretty crazy conclusions,they said in a blog post.
