BBC presenter Sally Jones says her 'close encounter' with Jimmy Savile remains one of the worst 'Eeee-eww!' moments of her life

As growing numbers of Jimmy Savile's victims come out of  the woodwork with increasingly shocking stories of the abuse and intimidation they suffered at the hands of him and other celebrities, a picture is emerging of a climate of routine sexism at the BBC during the Seventies and Eighties.

Already, well-known journalists and presenters including Liz  Kershaw, Miriam O'Reilly and  Vivien Creegor have told of their experiences of sexual harassment and discrimination, while the upper echelons of BBC news desperately attempt to close ranks and claim, (unconvincingly, given the natural curiosity hard-wired into most top journalists) to have shown absolutely no interest in the nitty-gritty of potentially explosive allegations made against one of their most  celebrated talents.

I have my own Savile story – a story with a difference, as I was not some impressionable 14-year-old at the time, but an experienced TV journalist in my early 30s who had already reported on some dangerous situations including the Brixton and Handsworth riots.

My 'close encounter' with Jimmy Savile, however, remains one of the worst 'Eeee-eww!' moments of my life – leaving me teeth-suckingly embarrassed rather than mentally scarred.

Newly arrived at BBC TV Centre in the late Eighties as a sports presenter on Breakfast Time, I found myself alone in a lift with him. We had met previously in Leeds while I was covering cricket for Channel 4 News, and when I helped out on one of his charity walks. But he was not a close friend and I had always found him a weird, self-conscious attention-seeker, even creepier than the rest of his fellow DJs.

I exchanged uneasy banter with him out of politeness, only to find him snuggling up for a smooch, complete with oddball sunglasses and wreathed in cigar smoke.

'It's our Sal,' he crowed. 'How about a kiss for Uncle Jimmy?' Bemused and a bit embarrassed, I proffered my cheek in gingerly fashion, only for him to grab my chin and thrust his tongue into my mouth.

The acrid taste of cigar smoke almost made me retch and I froze, cringing, as he ran one hand up from my waist and fumbled for my breast. Anger took over.

'Don't be so absolutely ridiculous,' I hissed. 'Take your hands off me and don't you ever touch me again!'

I peeled him off and pushed him away. He backed off grumbling that it was just a bit of fun, that I couldn't take a joke and was probably frigid.

I bolted out of the lift furiously, wiping my mouth, trying to rid myself of the taste of him. I felt dirty, as though I had somehow 'asked for it' and replayed the admittedly slightly smutty conversation in my mind.

After the incident in the lift with Savile Sally Jones confided what had  happened to her friend Jill Dando, herself a recent arrival and already  a popular newsreader

Yes, it was laden with innuendo, but on a fairly innocent level and no worse than any of the joky exchanges that were commonplace in most workplaces, particularly television in that era. 

I dashed into the Breakfast Time office and confided what had  happened to my friend Jill Dando, herself a recent arrival and already  a popular newsreader.

'Of course you didn't ask for it,' she reassured me, admitting that she had had to fend off plenty of unwelcome advances herself. 'He's just a dirty old perv – half the DJs are like that.'

I decided to keep quiet for the sake of my career – Savile was then one of the biggest names in showbiz. I regarded myself as a serious reporter and I certainly didn't want to be stereotyped as casting-couch fodder or a namby victim who could not stand up for herself.

There was quite a divide in the late Eighties between the TV presenters and reporters who were university-educated trained journalists – Kate Adie, Kirsty Wark, Sally Magnusson – and the 'old guard' of former actresses and beauty queens such as Jan Leeming, Debbie Greenwood and others who had been picked for their  winsome looks.

The latter, however capable they really were, tended to be patronised and treated like airheads by the thrusting young Turks then running the newsrooms. This was why, when I started in TV, as a sports-mad, relatively prudish single woman from a no-nonsense, God-fearing family, I had deliberately portrayed myself as straight-laced and head-girlish.

In the late Eighties and early Nineties, attitudes to women seemed to be changing rapidly, but yes, there were superstar 'dinosaurs' like Savile (whose paedophile tastes I was unaware of) and for some, John Peel in particular, it seemed a matter of pride to sleep with as many willing and naive girls and women as they could get their hands on.

An older, established presenter at the BBC was known for groping women he considered less than  his equals.

I believe that it is important not to demonise the BBC root and branch, by equating the horrors of Savile's criminal and manipulative targeting of young, vulnerable children over 40 years, with the sort of low-level, undignified harassment suffered by professional women such as Kershaw, O'Reilly and me. There is no comparison between the two.

Despite the humiliation and annoyance of our treatment, we adults were essentially capable of looking after ourselves.

When the hysteria has died down and the requisite number of broadcasting mandarins have fallen on their swords, the furore should, with luck, ensure that throughout the media, there is no longer any room for either paedophilia or sexual harassment – however famous the perpetrator.
