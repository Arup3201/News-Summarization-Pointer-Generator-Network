Celtic will discover on Tuesday if Scott Brown can play any part in their bid to qualify for the Champions League.

The Parkhead skipper has remained at the club’s Austrian training camp after being stretchered off with a hamstring injury during Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Rapid Vienna.

It’s understood Brown will now undergo a scan today to determine the exact nature of the damage, as Celtic sweat on the outcome.

Major doubt: Brown could miss all of Celtic's Champions League qualifiers after injuring his hamstring

Setback: The Celtic skipper looks irritated by the injury that could rule him out for months

Bad news: Celtic captain Scott Brown suffered a hamstring injury against Rapid Vienna

The worst-case scenario is a tear that could see the 29-year-old sidelined for up to eight weeks.

That would rule him out of all three rounds of games the Premiership champions must negotiate if they are to earn a £15million group stage jackpot from the continent’s elite competition.

It could also potentially make the national skipper a doubt for Scotland’s Euro 2016 opener against Germany on September 7.

Brown and manager Ronny Deila are still hoping the scan reveals only some form of strain. Even then, there is no realistic chance of the midfielder featuring in the opening Champions League tie against KR Reykjavik.

Celtic travel to the Icelandic capital in seven days’ time, with the return at Murrayfield a week later.

Ice cool: Finnish striker Teemu Pukki celebrates his goal for Celtic against Rapid Vienna on Sunday

Finnish striker Teemu Pukki, on target against Rapid, admitted Brown’s absence in the qualifiers would be a significant blow.

But Pukki remains convinced the club would still have enough quality to reach the group stage – with Beram Kayal the leading contender to step in.

‘Scott is a big character in the dressing room,’ said Pukki. ‘He is our captain and a great player so obviously we are concerned he is injured.

‘He is a guy we all look up to and you definitely know he is in the team. If you make a mistake or take things easy, he is the first one to let you know.

Training: Pukki said a long absence for Brown would be a huge blow for the Scottish club

‘Everything is a bit quieter when he is not around. He’s an important player for us and has experience of playing in big Champions League games.

‘I hope he can recover in time because you want your best players available for such important matches.

‘We will have to wait and see but we have a lot of good players at Celtic and I am sure whoever comes in will do a great job.’

Watching on: Fraser Forster had 11 days off between England's World Cup campaign and Celtic pre-season

Meanwhile, Fraser Forster insists he is happy to be back at work with Celtic despite his World Cup call-up denying him a proper summer break.

The 26-year-old only managed 11 days off between returning from Brazil with the England squad and heading out to join his club’s training camp in Austria.

Forster, attracting attention from Atletico Madrid and Southampton, is expected to sit out Tuesday’s friendly with LASK Linz but could play against Dukla Prague on Friday.

And he is keen to return to business with the opening Champions League qualifier now just a week away.

Joking around: Forster and Lukasz Zaluska enjoy themselves in training with goalkeeper coach Stevie Woods

‘We’ve all been apart for quite a bit of time so it’s good when you come back in and see people you’ve not really seen in six weeks and have a joke and a laugh,’ he told the Celtic website.

‘The serious business comes around so quickly, though, and we have competitive Champions League games two weeks into pre-season so you have to come back and hit the ground running.

‘Every day you’re preparing for that first game so it’s important you come back in good shape and give training 100 per cent every day until it kicks off.’

Rest: Forster has a lie down with Woods after a strenuous training session in Austria

Forster was thrilled to be part of Roy Hodgson’s squad, but didn’t manage any minutes on the pitch as his nation made a miserable first-round exit.

‘The World Cup was fantastic,’ he insisted. ‘I have been around the squad in the last couple of years so it was fantastic to go to a World Cup and a great experience.

‘I got another cap in the friendly in the lead up to it and it would have been nice if we had stayed in the tournament longer but that’s the way it happened.’
