Health-related gadgets are all the rage these days, from smart wristbands to apps that track what you consume.

But a new device from San Francisco-based Mark One, called Vessyl, claims to be able to streamline the process by putting all the technology you need in a cup.

The product can accurately identify your drink, tell you how many calories you are consuming, let you know how hydrated you are, and alert you when it’s time to drink again.

San Francisco firm Mark One has revealed a smart cup called Vessyl that knows what you drink and how often. The computing technology in the device can recognise any drink poured inside and also shows you how hydrated you are in the form of a vertical line (pictured) when it is tilted

Under the 
surface is the computing power that givers the device its ‘smart’ 
functionality - although how it works exactly is being kept a 
closely-guarded secret by makers Mark One.

The technology enables the cup to recognise what liquid is poured inside from a catalogue of thousands.

It
 knows the content and make-up of the drink, and is therefore able to 
let you know exactly what you are putting into your body.

The
 cup can then be asked to display a particular set of data to aid you 
achieve certain goals, such as losing weight or regulating caffeine

Vessyl comes in three colours - white, grey or black (or snow, steam and shadow to use the company’s terminology).

The device is available to pre-order now for £59 ($99), with a retail price of £117 ($199) from Vessyl’s website.

It will begin shipping in early 2015.

The cup is made of a glass-like material and holds 13 oz (385ml) of liquid.

When a beverage is poured in, from orange juice to beer, text on the side reveals what drink is inside.

The sliding lid of the cup is spill proof and it has a non-stick interior, making it easy to clean according to the company.

The cup can measure the caffeine levels inside a drink that has been poured into it (pictured), in addition to the sugar, protein, calories and fat inside a drink. By syncing with an app it is then able to provide further statistics about what the user has been drinking throughout the day

The display on the cup only lights up when the cup is tilted, as you would do when you take a drink.

A hydration bar on the side of the cup meanwhile, called Pryme, lets you know when your body needs a drink.

Vessyl charges wirelessly on a supplied charger, getting a week of power from a 60-minute charge.

The device also connects to an app on iOS and Android via Bluetooth, where you can get more detailed analysis of what you are drinking. 

Vessyl comes in three colours - white, black and grey (all shown) - and will be available in early 2015. The cup also sports a non-spill lid, while the interior is non-stick so it can be easily cleaned when you are switching between drinks. An hour's worth of wireless charging will give it a week's worth of battery life
