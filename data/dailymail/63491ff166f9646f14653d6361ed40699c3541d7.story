Arsene Wenger has hinted Gabriel will make his Arsenal debut in the FA Cup this weekend.

But Alexis Sanchez is likely to miss the clash against Middlesbrough with a knee problem sustained in the win over Leicester.

Brazilian Gabriel is yet to play since arriving from Villarreal last month.

But Wenger - who also confirmed Wojciech Szczesny will play against Middlesbrough - says the central defender is 'very close' to making his senior bow.

The Frenchman said: 'Gabriel is very close to making his debut. He has the ability, good pace and he's good in the air.

'Some players will play who have not played recently but we will treat this game exactly the same as a Premier League game.

'Szczesny will play. He is completely ready and determined to play.'

Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, who joined from Nice in the summer, has taken Szczesny's place

Wenger also believes there is an underlying reason for Aaron Ramsey's continuing injury travails - but Arsenal are yet to find it.

The Wales midfielder was a substitute for Tuesday night's Premier League victory over Leicester, but was replaced after only nine minutes due to a hamstring problem and now looks set to spend more time on the sidelines.

'We haven't found the underlying reason,' said Wenger, speaking ahead of the holders' FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough on Sunday.

'There is an underlying reason that is medical or bio-mechanical, because he's a guy who is serious, works hard.

'There's no obvious reason why he should have muscular injuries.'

Wenger played down the severity of the problem which is expected to keep Ramsey out for a fortnight and insisted Arsenal's training methods are sound.

'It's not a major injury. It's a grade one,' he added.

'We have individualised training. I don't think that is any special case that has been neglected.' 

Arsenal qualified for the FA Cup round after a 3-2 victory against Brighton in January
