He might be a future king but the Duke of Cambridge has revealed he likes the simple things in life such as good value food and popular music.

William said Morrisons Value pasta was 'not too bad', and confessed to listening to Coldplay - and American rock band Linkin Park - while chatting to school children today.

The Prince spent more than an hour at Goole High School, in East Yorkshire to launch a new award for primary school children as royal patron of the charity SkillForce, which draws on the values and skills of ex-forces personnel to inspire young people to achieve at school.

He spent some of his time apologising to the youngsters for the pouring rain.

'I'm so sorry I didn't bring better weather with me,' the Duke said to flag-waving pupils as he arrived.

He watched the youngsters take part in a team bridge-building exercise in the school yard which was inspired by the 70th anniversary of D-Day later this week.

As he chatted to members of the school's samba band, which was providing the musical accompaniment, he refused an offer to play one of the drums.

He told one of the drummers: 'I used to play the piano, trumpet and drums when I was your age but I couldn't read music. There's only so much you can remember from the top of your head.'

And when one of the band asked him what music he liked, the Duke was heard to reply: 'I really like Coldplay, Linkin Park.'

Inside the school, William chatted to pupils taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme who told him about their expedition planning.

Inspecting a packet of Morrisons Value instant pasta and cheese, he said: 'Have you tried this before? It's OK, it's not too bad.

'It's better than the beef stew and dumplings which is quite a heavy one.'

William chatted about the SkillForce initiative with staff, pupils and representatives of the charity.

The new SkillForce Junior Prince's Award is aimed at nine and 10-year-olds, especially under-privileged children who do not have easy access to these kind of activities.

It is particularly aimed as smoothing the transition for children between primary and secondary school.

The award involves team-building and problem-solving challenges, team sports, outdoor pursuits including camping, first aid, navigation, observing remembrance and community projects.

Goole High School has worked with a group of local primary schools to develop the new national award programme.

Speaking before the visit, Peter Cross, chief executive of SkillForce, said: 'The award is designed to engage younger learners in exciting lessons, challenges and community projects that prepare them for secondary education, a time when some students can begin to lose their way.

After his school visit the Duke attended an employment workshop session with youth homeless charity Centrepoint

'Our programme builds up the children's confidence, resilience, team work and problem solving to give them a boost before the start of new adventures and encourage them to take a more active role in their town, city or village.

'It's SkillForce's 10th birthday, and we are honoured that our royal patron has marked the occasion by lending his support to the Junior Prince's Award for roll-out across the country.'

Hundreds of children and local residents stood and waved in the rain as the duke left by helicopter from the school field.

He arrived by car earlier after his planned helicopter touch-down was cancelled due to the weather.

Afterwards, William travelled to West Yorkshire where he visited the youth homeless charity Centrepoint's base in Bradford.
