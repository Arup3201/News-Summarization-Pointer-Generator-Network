This lively prairie dog pup clearly doesn't want his worn-out dad to have a rest, as he pesters him to keep playing by jumping on his back.

The pup had been keeping his parents busy, scurrying around the desert floor under the hot sun in Arizona.

And even when his exhausted dad takes timeout for a rest, he climbs on to his back to urge him to keep up with the game.

No rest for you: The pup climbs on to the back of his dad, who is trying to enjoy a well-earned break

Never give up: The lively pup clearly doesn't want to give his dad a break, and he eventually gets his way when his father gets back to his feet

Once dad was up on his feet again, he had time for a quick snack on some fruit before chasing after his son again.

Professional photographer John Shaw, from Oregon, captured the family scenes in the desert.

Mr Shaw, 67, said: 'It was a typical Arizona day - warm, dry and cloudless - as the prairie dogs ran around in the sand.

'I laughed when the pup climbed onto his dad's back.

'He looked like a classic tired parent who had earned a moment's break or even a little snooze.

'But the pup was full of life and having none of it.'

Mr Shaw took the images at the Sonoran Desert Museum, in Tuscan.

Eat it while you can: Dad quickly munches on some food to fuel the next round of games with his son, who clearly cannot leave his parents alone for long
