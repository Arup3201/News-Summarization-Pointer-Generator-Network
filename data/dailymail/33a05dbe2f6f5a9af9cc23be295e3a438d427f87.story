An owl who was hit in the head by shrapnel near border between Israel and Gaza is recovering after it was rescued by a passing vet.

The long-eared owl from Kibbutz Nirim, just over the border from the heavily bombarded Gaza town of Khan Yunis, where hundreds have been killed, was knocked off its perch by a fragment of mortar shrapnel.

Veterinary student Ben Itay found the wounded owl and took him home, but as the kibbutz was under fire he could not get it to proper vet's facilities. When he was able, he took the owl to colleagues at the Ramat Gan Safari park for treatment.

Kocked from its perch: X-rays of the rescued owl show where the mortar shrapnel is lodged inside its head

The bird was x-rayed and found to have metal fragments in its head as well as injuries to its right eye and beak. 

It is now being treated and vets hope it will no lose sight in its injured eye.

Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israeli forces shelled a UN Relief Works Agency school sheltering Palestinians displaced by the invasion, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens more.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was 'appalled' by the attack on a building where hundreds had taken refuge after they were told to leave their homes by the Israeli army.

In three weeks since Israel launched its latest offensive against the besieged territory, a total of nearly 750 people have been killed. More than 100,000 have sought sanctuary in UN facilities in Gaza.

Israel has lost 32 soldiers since it launched its ground invasion, which followed nearly two weeks of aerial bombardment aimed at stopping militants from firing rockets at Israeli cities.

'Today’s attack underscores the imperative for the killing to stop – and to stop now,' Mr. Ban declared.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, civilians in Gaza have no safe place to go with 44 per cent of the land declared a ‘no-go zone’ by the Israeli army.

UNRWA facilities are only slightly safer. At least 18 medical facilities, include five UNRWA health clinics have been hit by airstrikes and shelling.
