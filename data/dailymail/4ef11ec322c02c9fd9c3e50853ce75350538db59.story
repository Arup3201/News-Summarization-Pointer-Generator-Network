Manchester United fans are facing a 360-mile round trip on a Friday night to see their team play at Cambridge after the FA Cup fourth-round tie was chosen for BBC screening.

In what will be seen as another blow to the competition, it was confirmed on Wednesday that one of the ties of the round has been brought forward 24 hours to Friday, January 23, to kick off four days of coverage on the BBC and BT Sport. It follows the FA’s decision to spread the third round over five days.

There are concerns the switch will cause travel chaos for United fans. The game kicks off at 7.55pm and the last train back to Manchester via London will have left before the game has even finished.

Cambridge are unlikely to complain about the decision, however, with the League Two club guaranteed £144,000 from the live coverage.

A BBC spokesman explained the move, saying: ‘We are looking to reach a wide BBC1 audience and matches played on Friday and Monday nights have proved popular with viewers so far.’

United fans reacted furiously to the switch and took to social media to vent their anger.
