Heart-breaking video footage and photographs of terrified school students aboard the doomed Sewol South Korean ferry as it begins to capsize have emerged today.

In footage recovered from a phone belonging to one of the passengers aboard the ill-fated Sewol ferry, a student can be heard saying: 'This is fun'. Clearly unaware of the severity of their situation, another says: 'This is like Titanic.'

Moments later, as the ferry begins to tilt and shake, one young boy can be heard saying: 'I want to get off. We don't want to die.'

Pictures from the phone show groups of terrified young men wearing life jackets as 
they attempt to make sense of the terrifying situation.

This picture, taken with a mobile phone by deceased South Korean high school student Park Su-hyeon, shows a group of students wearing life jackets and holding on to what they can as the South Korean ferry sinks. The boy also filmed the terrifying scene

One of the boys shouts 'This is like Titanic' as the vessel begins to tilt and shake. Moments later, the boys begin to panic - with some saying they don't want to die and they want to get off the ship

Towards the end of the footage, found on a phone belonging to Park Su-hyeon, 17, one child can be heard documenting his last words - saying: 'This looks like the end'.

Another poignantly says: 'These are pictures we need to take as our last memories,' before another boy cuts in and says: 'Mom, Dad, I love you.'

The harrowing footage comes as an off-duty captain claims he warned the ship shouldn't carry too much cargo because it wasn't stable enough. He says these concerns were ignored by operators.

The captain, whom prosecutors will only identify by his surname, Shin, was on vacation on the day of the tragedy two weeks ago.

At the time, the ship was carrying 476 people, mostly from one high school. Only 174 people survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members.

The ferry was piloted April 16 by a substitute captain, Lee Joon-seok, who is now being detained along with 14 other crew members who were involved in navigating the Sewol.

One of the students shouts 'I want to get off. I mean it'. The footage was recovered from the phone of Park Su-hyeon, who perished in the tragedy on April 16

Another boy can be heard saying 'We don't want to die, we don't want to die.' An off-duty captain claims he told ferry operators he had concerns about the stability of the ferry before it sunk

Yesterday, heartbreaking footage emerged showing passengers trapped on board the sinking South Korean ferry desperately trying to break windows before the ship disappears beneath the surface.

In the harrowing video, an arm can be seen hammering on the glass in a frantic attempt to reach rescuers who are just a few feet away on the other side.

Moments later, the ferry sinks below the waves, leaving the passengers with no hope of escaping alive or the rescue boats of saving them.

Today's footage was taken from the phone of 17-year-old student Su-hyeon  - who was one of about 250 high school students aboard the ill-fated ferry.

After the student's body was recovered, officers returned the boy's personal items to his family - who found the footage on his phone.

The boy's father released to video to local media earlier this week - saying lessons must be learnt from his son's death.

When Choi 
Seung-ho, South Korean television broadcaster, introduced the footage 
on Newstapa, he said: 'This is by far the most heartbreaking 
scene I have seen in my 27-year broadcasting career.'

Some of the boys take a moment to record their final words. It is thought around 150 of the 443 passengers aboard the ship were students

Su-hyeon’s video begins at 8:52am - three minutes before ferry officials sent the first distress signal to maritime controllers on shore.

As panic mounts in the cabin, an announcer can be heard telling the children to stay where they were and hold on to what they could.

Ferry officials later told investigators they thought this was the safest option.

Moments later, one student says: 'This is going to be a lot of fun if we get it onto our Facebook.'

At 8:57, another announcement is made and, clearly panicked, one boy asks: 'Should I call Mom? Mom, this looks like the end of me.'

In footage taken from another video of student Park Ye-seul, who also died on the ferry, a group of girls can be hear cheering as helicopters arrive.

The off duty captain of the Sewol claims he warned the ferry company renovations had altered the balance of the ship and undermined its anti-rolling ability

However, footage of rescuers show coast guards did not attempt to save those below deck - where both student would have been trapped.

The footage is being reviewed as part of ongoing investigations in to the tragedy.

Meanwhile, the off duty captain's claims he warned ship owners of the vessel's instability are also being investigated.

Yang
 Jung-jin, a senior prosecutor on the team investigating the incident, 
wouldn't say when the captain warned the company and didn't know whether
 Shin made multiple warnings about stability.

A
 stability test report on January 24 from the Korean Register of 
Shipping showed the ferry became top-heavy and less stable after a 
modification of the ship from October 2012 to February 2013 that 
involved adding more cabins in some of the ship's floors.

Senior prosecutor Ahn Sang-don, also part of the investigation team, said today that authorities detained two employees at Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd., the ferry's owner, on suspicions of accidental homicide stemming from professional negligence in connection with the sinking.

Ahn wouldn't identify the employees.

Elsewhere, family members of high school students killed in the sinking dismissed as insincere President Park Geun-hye's apology for the government's handling of the disaster.

They called for the quick retrieval of the missing. Divers have so far recovered 212 bodies from the
 wreckage.

They fought strong currents and floating debris inside the 
ship again Wednesday as they searched for 90 passengers still missing.

After several days of sluggish search 
efforts because of bad weather, divers on Tuesday retrieved more than a 
dozen bodies from the ship, which lies on the ocean floor, triggering a 
fresh outpouring of emotions by family members waiting for the return of
 their loved ones.

Park
 apologized Tuesday for the government's inept initial response to the 
sinking. Her apology came amid rising indignation over claims by the 
victims' relatives that the government did not do enough to rescue or 
protect their loved ones.

Earlier Tuesday, she visited a memorial set up in Ansan city where the high school students are from.

Some
 angry family members shouted at Park, demanded an apology and moved 
away condolence flowers sent by her and other top officials, according 
to South Korean media reports.

'What
 Park did at the memorial altar was like coming there to shoot an 
advertisement, surrounded by bodyguards,' Yu Gyeong-geun, the father of 
one of the students, said Tuesday.
