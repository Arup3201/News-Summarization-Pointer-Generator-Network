Trendy teaching methods such as lavishing praise on pupils can be harmful to learning, says a study published today.

It warns that many ‘common practices’, such as allowing youngsters to discover key ideas by themselves, are either ‘ineffective or inefficient’.

The report from the Sutton Trust education charity outlines a range of popular techniques used in classrooms that are ‘not supported by research evidence’.

Examples include using praise ‘lavishly’, which many teachers believe is an ‘affirmative and positive’ way to encourage low achievers. 

It points out that a number of studies suggest that the ‘wrong kinds of praise’ can be ‘very harmful to learning’.

Research has shown that praise which is meant to boost struggling pupils ‘actually conveys a message of the teachers’ low expectations’ of their ability’.

As a result, ‘it can actually lower rather than enhance self-confidence’, the report reveals. 

The report by Professor Rob Coe and colleagues at Durham University reviewed more than 200 pieces of research.

It says another popular technique, ‘discovery learning’, where pupils find key ideas by themselves, is also ineffective.

The study says: ‘If teachers want them to learn new ideas, knowledge or methods they need to teach them directly.’ 

Former education secretary Michael Gove warned such teaching methods were 'sidelining' members of staff from their 'central role in education' 

Another trendy teaching method is child-centred learning, where pupils are believed to learn best if teachers tailor lessons to their ‘preferred learning style’.

The report says: ‘A belief in the importance of learning styles seems persistent, despite the prominence of critiques of this kind of advice.’ 

However, the evidence is clear that ‘there are no benefits for learning from trying to present information to learners in their preferred learning style’.  

Likewise, it is untrue that pupils remember best if they are always ‘active’ in lessons, rather than sitting and listening ‘passively’.

‘If you want students to remember something you have to get them to think about it,’ the report says.

‘This might be achieved by being “active” or “passive”.’  

Other examples of ineffective teaching practices are encouraging re-reading and highlighting to memorise key ideas.

Studies have shown that ‘testing yourself, trying to generate answers, and deliberately creating intervals between study to allow forgetting’ are better.

The report also found that grouping pupils by ability makes very little difference to learning, as teachers can go ‘too fast with the high ability groups and too slow with the low’. 

It said that the two factors with the strongest evidence of improving students’ attainment are teachers’ content knowledge and the quality of instruction.

Professor Coe said: ‘Great teaching cannot be achieved by following a recipe, but there are some clear pointers in the research to approaches that are most likely to be effective, and to others, sometimes quite popular, that are not.

‘Teachers need to understand why, when and how a particular approach is likely to enhance students’ learning.’

Former education secretary Michael Gove warned that trendy teaching methods were ‘sidelining’ members of staff from their ‘central role in education’.

Last year, Michael Young, emeritus professor of education at the Institute of Education, University of London, claimed that many teachers have an ‘actual fear of knowledge’ and believe it is wrong to correct pupils’ mistakes.
