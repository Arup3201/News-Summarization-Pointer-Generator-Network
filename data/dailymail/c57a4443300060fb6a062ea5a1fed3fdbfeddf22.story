Cat owners have raised fears for their pets' lives after more than 100 went missing in one town - and some returned possible signs of abuse.

The animals have all vanished from Ipswich, Suffolk, where their worried owners have told police and animal protection groups.

Their fears were heightened this week after Rupert, a four-month-old tabby kitten, returned a night after going missing with burnt whiskers, bruises and missing chunks of fur.

Ms Catchpole said vets told her Rupert (pictured today) 'looked like he had been kicked around like a football'

Rupert's owner Louise Catchpole, 30, said he and another kitten called Nigella went missing from her home on Sunday night.

'When he came back he was limping, covered in faeces and absolutely terrified,' she said. 'His whiskers had been burned, there was a large chunk of fur that seemed to have been ripped out.

'When I took him to the vets they said it looked like he had been kicked around like a football.'

Nigella was found unharmed yesterday, but Ms Catchpole said she feared that she was also taken but managed to escape unharmed.

'I think this needs to be taken very seriously,' she added. 'I am so relieved to have the cats back but they are both very nervous now. I am not letting them out of my sight at the moment.' 

The worried owner is one of almost 400 who have joined the community group Ipswich Missing Cats on Facebook.

Recognise this animal? Cat owners in Ipswich, Suffolk, say more than 100 have gone missing this year, most of them in recent months. Pictured is Lulu, one of the missing pets who is spayed but not microchipped

The group has so far counted 108 cats missing since the start of the year, most of which have been in the last few months.

Only a handful are thought to have returned, including Rupert and Nigella, and it is thought at least three were injured.

The pet owners said one animal, whose owner asked not to be named, had to be put down after coming back injured.

Another, one-year-old Jenessa who belongs to Sarah Mindham, 44, limped back in through her owner's catflap after a week with a broken pelvis.

'I think that she could have been taken because she had no other injuries,' her owner said.

'I took her to the vet and they said she could have been run over but she could have also been kicked, it's a really scary thought.' 

Kirsty Downing, 37, lost two of her four cats at the beginning of September and is convinced somebody is stealing the animals.

The mother-of-three said her pets were ‘very homely’ and it was more than a coincidence that Marley, six, and Oreo, two, had disappeared at exactly the same time.

The teaching assistant added: ‘They both went off on the same day and didn't return. It was only when I went on the Facebook group that I realised so many had disappeared.

‘It is strange because they are very homely cats but it made sense when I heard that somebody had been taking them.'

Part-time nanny Deni Parkes, 50, who founded the group, said many pet owners she spoke to were now so frightened they did not want to let their cats outdoors.

'I believe someone is harming them and whoever is doing this needs to get some psychiatric help', she said.

'You have to think if these people can torture a cat, they can easily torture a child or another person.'

She said her group has been inundated by stories of pets vanishing, including one owner who lost all three of his pets in a single week.

The disappearances began at the beginning of the year but have markedly increased in recent months, the owners said. 

David Smith, the co-ordinator of Cats Protection’s Ipswich branch, said: 'We hear of cases of cats going missing or being mistreated from time to time but to hear of this number of cats going missing in such a short space of time is astonishing.

'It must be completely heart-breaking for the owners concerned to have lost their beloved pets and, in some cases, not know what has become of them.

'It is also horrific to hear that some of these cats have returned with such serious injuries that they have had to be put to sleep.'

Ipswich mayor Bill Quinton said: 'I share the devastation any cat owner feels when their much-loved pet goes missing or is injured or killed.

'I hope there is no pattern behind this - certainly, we have not experienced any increase in reports to the council.

'People who are worried should contact the RSPCA or Ipswich Cats Protection, who both do excellent work.'

The RSPCA urged owners who fear their cat is in danger to call them on 0300 1234 999. 

Sergeant Mark Thomas, of Suffolk Police, said: 'Police have been made aware of allegedly stolen or mistreated cats in the Ipswich area.

'The matter is being looked into and officers will establish if any criminal offences have taken place.'
