A longtime member of the Boy Scouts in Arizona who was accidentally outed as gay on Facebook lost out on a coveted summer job with the organization because of his sexuality, it has been claimed.

Garrett Bryant, 19, was looking forward to a leadership position in Phoenix when he was told last month that he was was no longer eligible.

'I viewed my sexuality as something I was going to keep private,' Bryant told NBC News.

'It was my private life. I wasn’t going to share it with the BSA.'

Upset: Garrett Bryant, seen here in an interview with MSNBC, said he was told because he had 'engaged in homosexuality' he no longer qualified for a position at a coveted summer camp

One week before he received the bad news, Bryant had updated his status on Facebook to say he was in a relationship after getting his first boyfriend.

He wrote nothing further.

He received many congratulatory responses, and at least one friend inquired, "'what's his name?'

Bryant realized the mistake nine to 12 hours later and removed the comments, but it was too late.

He says he believes Boy Scouts officials saw the post or were told about it.

When he called to ask about why he was turned down, he was told it was for having 'engaged in homosexuality'.

'They made an issue of my sexuality,' Bryant told NBC.

'I was perfectly content with staying in the closet with the Scouts.'

'But I couldn't control other people outing me, even if by accident.'

Bryant first started going to the camp as an 11-year-old Boy Scout.

This year the Boy Scouts began allowing openly gay teens into their ranks, but still don't allow gay adults.

Bryant, a Northern Arizona University freshman, is still considered a youth for many programs in the organization, but not for all of them.

In an interview with The New York Daily News, Bryant said he was filled with sadness over the incident.

'I felt just extreme sadness,' he said.

'I am not one to cry easily. It was pretty intense.'

His mom, Kat Bryant, said she is angry about what occurred.

'The whole reason we went public with it is to bring it to light that halfway is nowhere near good enough,' she said.

When Garrett turns 21, he may face more problems from the organization's rules.

'How will they [BSA] even know these people are gay unless they start digging into people’s Facebook posts?" Scoutcamp.org webmaster Ed Henderson told NBC News.

'It’s going to create a witch hunt.'
