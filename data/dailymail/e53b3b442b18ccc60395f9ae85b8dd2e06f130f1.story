These are the pictures posted on a social networking website which raised the suspicions of Queensland Police and led to bomb squads being sent to a home just kilometres from where the G20 will be held. 

They were posted on Facebook by a 32-year-old Rochedale South man whose home was searched by police and a series of controlled explosions were carried out on Saturday afternoon. 

The man has been charged with a number of offences including manufacturing explosives, following the discovery of explosive chemicals, drugs, bullet shells and a training grenade, reports ABC.

The photos were seen by police and bomb squads were sent to his home to investigate 

Photos of home-made explosives were found on the man's Facebook page which grabbed the attention of the police

Superintendent Noel Powers told media at a press conference on Sunday the man, from Logan City in Brisbane's south, was not an avid maker but that the man had been 'fully compliant' with police inquiries. 

'[He's] someone with an unhealthy curiosity towards explosives, combined with a limited knowledge of chemistry - perhaps a more than average level of knowledge in chemistry - it's a lethal combination. 

'He's been posting certain images and comments on Facebook that has come to our attention and thank God we've been able to action it from there,' Superintendent Powers told the press conference, reports ABC.

Queensland Police have warned 'even small amounts' of chemicals found at the home could be dangerous. 

A police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that several streets have been blocked off since Saturday afternoon and will remain in lock-down for the next couple of days.

Commissioner Ian Stewart said all motorcades will be watched over the next 10 days to ensure leaders are taken from the airport to accommodation, as well as their meetings with full security. 

The man's Facebook page is littered with pictures of him holding guns and knives 

Roads near the property will remain closed for the next few days 

Queensland Police say there's no suggestion they are linked to terrorism

'Until this event is safely delivered, we will continue to operate and conduct bomb searches outside the centre,' he said in a conference on Sunday.

'It is concerning as to why someone would do this in a suburban area and it's a situation where people are dealing with dangerous chemicals but our job now is to render the scene safe.

'We can ensure the community that there has been no threats to the G20 or anything related to the summit meeting.'

Treasurer Tim Nicholls said the police operation has been running exceptionally smooth to ensure everyone has a safe and secure environment ahead of next week's leaders summit.

'We encourage people to come to the city and do so with high certainty of being safe and enjoy life as normal', he said.

'In a major event like this, we are conducting a peaceful and secure summit here in Brisbane, not just for our guests and visitors but for the entire community.

'And this is a real opportunity for Queensland to show the rest of the world what we do.' 

Queensland police were called to Rochedale South in Logan City of Brisbane's southside at 4.15pm on Saturday after discovering explosive devices in a home

Officers from the Explosive Ordnance Response Team are dealing with numerous explosive devices and will continue to render the scene safe with controlled detonations continuing throughout the day.

Police are advising nearby residents to stay indoors and warn they're likely to hear explosions.

The emergent situation under the Public Safety Preservation Act is still in place after some substances were too dangerous to move.
