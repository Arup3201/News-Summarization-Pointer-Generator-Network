A wife watched in horror as her race driver husband was killed in a crash at one of Britain’s most famous circuits.

Denis Welch, 69, a businessman from Dilhorne, Staffordshire, died when he lost control of a 1960 Lotus 18 during a race for pre-1966 Grand Prix cars at Silverstone in Northamptonshire yesterday.

He was well known on the classic racing circuit both as a driver and through his car parts business empire, based at Yoxall, near Lichfield.

Mr Welch’s son, Jeremy, said his 70-year-old mother Tina had gone to watch the race. He added that he was comforted by the knowledge his father ‘died doing what he loved’.

He said: ‘My mum is devastated because her whole life was her partner and motor racing. Her world’s been turned upside down.

‘They were married for 45 years and were both so passionate about classic car racing. He’d been driving for a very long time so he was fully aware of the risks.

‘Accidents happen and it’s very unfortunate. The car turned upside down and he died almost immediately. The one consoling fact was that it was very swift and he died doing what he loved.’

Jeremy said his father, who completed a foundry apprenticeship in Wolverhampton, had driven the Lotus on a number of occasions and no blame was being placed on the car’s manufacturers.

The son added that his brother Timothy was flying back from Chamonix in France, where he lived with his partner and their newborn baby.

Both inherited a passion for racing from their father. Jeremy bought Denis Welch Motorsport, based at Yoxall, from his father eight years ago.

He said he was pleased the Silverstone Classic race meeting restarted after the tragedy. ‘That was what he would have wanted,’ he stated.

Essex-born Mr Welch began in business by buying a petrol station, but took time out to start a family.

Jeremy said: ‘When he restarted in the early 1980s he grew the race preparation business from there and it now employs 28 people.

‘He was best known for his exploits with Austin Healy cars and built a business specialising in parts for those cars, which was well known around the world.

‘He retired eight years ago, but continued to pursue his passion for driving race cars. He started racing in 1965 and although he took it seriously, never really had ambitions to race professionally.’

Police and the Motor Sports Association, the UK official motor sport governing body, is conducting a full investigation into his death.
