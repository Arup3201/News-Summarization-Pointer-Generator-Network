As a fashion brand it loves to court controversy, placing bare chested male assistants outside stores to lure in customers.

But the popular American label Abercrombie and Fitch is now facing a backlash after its chief executive declared its clothes were only for the 'thin and cool'.

Some of Hollywood's most glamorous stars are supporting a boycott of the fashion retailer after they were accused of discriminating against overweight customers.

Pop idol Miley Cyrus vowed to burn her collection of A&F clothes, while other celebrities including chat show how Ellen DeGeneres and former Cheers star Kirstie Alley said they will support a boycott.

The backlash began last month after it was revealed the company's stores worldwide do not stock clothes for plus sized women.

The largest size available at the company's 1,000 stores was a size 14 - size 16 in the UK' flagship store in Saville Row, London.

As protesters in the U.S. accused the company of discrimination an old interview by its chief executive Mark Jeffries further fuelled the controversy.

In the 2006 interview he said: 'In every school, there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids.

'We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong (in our clothes), and they can't belong.'

'Cool kids': Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries said in 2006 that a lot of people 'don't belong' in the retailer's clothes - they're only for 'cool kids'

Jeffries swiftly apologised for his remarks saying they had been taken out of context.

But as the row died down he provoked fresh outrage when he said the chain's clothes were for a 'particular segment' of 'aspirational' young people.

Abercrombie stores across the U.S. saw demonstrations from members of the public, while a Los Angeles filmmaker became an internet hit with a film showing the stores clothes being handed out to homeless people as part of a 'brand readjustment'.

The company attempted to ride out the nightmare PR by announcing the support of anti-bullying measures. But now with celebrities calling for a boycott many business analysts fear the brand will be further damaged.

Chat show host Ellen DeGeneres mocked the firm by pretending some tiny doll clothes were its 'double zero' size.

She warned her 4million viewers that the T-shirt might shrink in the wash.

Kirstie Alley, the former Cheers actress who has struggled publicly with her weight, said she was banning her two children from shopping at the chain.

In an open letter to Jeffries, she tweeted: 'You are not cute and your head is huge... you need to stop wearing A&F clothing.'

Miley Cyrus, who has millions of fans, said she was going to burn her A&F clothes as they were 'stinking up my place.'

Even before the controversy sales at the 121 year old fashion label had plunged by 17 per cent. Last year the company had sales of over £2.1billion.

In the past they have been accused been sued for discriminating against ethnic groups and choosing only 'attractive' sales assistants.

Last year it emerged that employees had to carry out physical exercises while at work to maintain the 'thin and beautiful' look.

According to a company email, male employees at the retailer's Milan flagship in Italy had to carry out 10 push-ups, while women who failed to measure up were given ten squats.

Two years ago the retailer sparked outrage by banning shop assistant Harriet Phipps, 18, from wearing a poppy at work in Southampton. She was told it was 'not part of her uniform'. The store later changed its policy.

In 2009 Abercrombie & Fitch had to pay an employee with a prosthetic arm £8,000 for unlawful harassment.

Riam Dean, 22, said she was made to work in the stockroom at a central London store because she did not fit in with the company's image.
