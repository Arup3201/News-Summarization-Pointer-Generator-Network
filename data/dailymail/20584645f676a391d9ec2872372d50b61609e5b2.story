An animal charity has launched a spoof website which, upon first inspection, appears to let users 'exchange' their dogs for puppies.

The Toronto Humane Society's thought-provoking campaign, dubbed PuppySwap, advertises a subscription service which allows pet-owners to browse through breeds, order puppies and then trade them in as soon as they get older and 'less cute.'

'PuppySwap isn’t real', the website admits. 'Unfortunately, pet abandonment is.'

Pick me! The fake site advertises a subscription service which allows pet-owners to browse through breeds before picking their temporary 'new best friend' 

The tongue-in-cheek website features fake reviews from customers on specific breeds.

For a King Charles Spaniel, one reads: 'They grow up way too fast. Great for the short term.'

Similarly, a review on a Golden Retriever reads: 'Can't go wrong with a classic. On my fifth one already.'

In an ad for the website, the chirpy voice-over states: 'The moment your puppy grows up, becomes a bother or gets less likable, simply log back into your account and swap out your old best friend for a brand new one.'

Making a point: Users can browse breeds for puppies based on their 'social likability' and 'cute factor'

According to the Toronto Humane Society, 180,000 animals enter Canadian shelters each year. Tragically, 40per cent will never leave.

'Help us spread the word,' says the website. 'Pet ownership is for life.'

The ad, which has been seen over 80,000 times since it was uploaded to YouTube last week, has fooled a fair few viewers.

'What a f*****g stupid idea!! What's next? Baby swap? Then what the f**k will happen to the dog? How about its feelings? Just wrong in so many ways,' one commenter wrote. 

Others, who managed to watch the ad until the end, at which point all becomes clear, were more complimentary of the viral marketing effort.

'Great satire piece on a horrible thing humans do,' one surmised.
