As a federal lawmaker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is legally exempt from jury duty. But the Republican legislator answered his summons on Friday anyway, setting Houston's courthouse abuzz.

The Senate is session today, but Cruz flew home last night in order to be on hand at the courthouse this morning.

'I'd actually never been called to jury duty before,' Cruz told ABC 13. 'I got the summons and I was happy to come down and do my civic duty.'

As the politician arrived, he took off his shoes and handed in his bag so they could be scanned by security

He sat taking notes in the front of the courtroom as the process began 

The city of Houston specifically states on its website that residents are exempt from jury duty if 'you are an officer or employee of the Senate, the House of Representatives, or any department, commission, board, office, or other agency, in the legislative branch of State government'

Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, could have easily filed paperwork asking to be excused from today's proceedings on those grounds.

Instead, the trained lawyer joined roughly 100 of his constituents at the Houston courthouse today, posing for photos with those that asked.

'My parents are huge supporters,' a young woman told him, according to the Houston Chronicle, as she had her picture taken with the local leader.

'I wish I could say I took a picture with a future president,' one man told the presumed 2016 presidential candidate.

As jury selection began, Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett advised Cruz on Twitter to go ballistic a la a scene in the classic movie A Few Good Men and scream, 'Did you order the Code Red?'

A judge for Houston's Criminal District Court, Ryan Patrick, later said on Twitter that Cruz was among 65 potential jurors 'randomly' selected for voire dire in a felony criminal case. 

He took the opportunity to smile for a photograph with Dr. Nazanin Hebel, another person part of the process 

Patrick did not state the outcome of the interview process, but it's unlikely that Cruz was selected as part of the 12-member jury given the circumstances

Cruz acknowledged to the Chronicle that actually being named to a jury would present problems to fulfilling his duties as a U.S. Senator, yet he indicated to reporters that he knew he'd never make it far enough in the jury selection process for that to become a serious consideration.

'It would be a bit of a complication if I ended up in a six-week trial. That would be in some tension with getting back to Washington and doing my job representing Texans,' Cruz said. 'But I think at the end of the day that'll work itself out.'

And while entire episode was mainly for show, Cruz used the opportunity to advocate for greater civic engagement.

'I would certainly encourage everyone else when you get a jury summons to come down to participate,' told ABC's Houston bureau. 'It's like voting. It's part of the responsibilities of the citizen.'

Still, the trained lawyer and likely 2016 presidential candidate joined roughly 100 of his constituents at the Houston, Texas, courthouse today, posing for photos with those that asked
