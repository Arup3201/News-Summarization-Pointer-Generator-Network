Club Tijuana star Juan Arango conjured memories Luis Suarez in his team's 4-3 defeat by Monterrey in the Mexican league - but it was not through prodigious scoring.

The Venezuelan icon Arango sank his teeth into the shoulder of Jesus Zavela as his temper flared in the defeat. 

He was not booked by the referee but could face a heavy retrospective ban.

Arango had earlier curled in a magnificent free kick for his team to bring them level after falling 2-0 down early on in the encounter.

But the 34-year-old overshadowed his goal with the bite as television cameras picked up the moment of madness.

Arango spent 10 years playing in Europe, spending five seasons each at Real Mallorca in Spain and Borussia Monchengladbach in Germany. He has made 121 appearances for Venezuela.
