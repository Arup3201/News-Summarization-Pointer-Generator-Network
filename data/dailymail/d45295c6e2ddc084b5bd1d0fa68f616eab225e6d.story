Parents of 43 missing college students have angrily rejected the Mexican attorney general's declaration that their children were murdered.

The male students disappeared last September near the southern city of Iguala after they were taken into custody by police and handed over to a drug gang, who killed them, burned the bodies and tossed their remains into a river.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said definitively for the first time yesterday that all the students were dead. 

During an emotional news conference last night, Murillo Karam cited confessions and forensic evidence that showed that the fire blazed for hours at a temperature sufficient to turn 43 bodies into ashes.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said definitively for the first time yesterday that all the students were dead

The male students disappeared last September near the southern city of Iguala after they were taken into custody by police and handed over to a drug gang, who killed them, burned the bodies and tossed their remains into a river 

The remains in bags that were found in the river had traces of the dump where the fire occurred. 

Murillo Karam said the investigation 'gives us the legal certainty that the student teachers were killed in the circumstances that have been described'.

He added they came to the conclusion through expert and witness testimony that  'beyond a doubt that the students were abducted and killed, before being incinerated and thrown into the San Juan river, in that order'.

Relatives who marched on Monday with several thousand people in Mexico City to mark the four-month mark since the disappearance, accused the government of trying to wrap up the investigation leaving many questions unanswered.

'We don't believe anything of what they say,' said Carmen Cruz, mother of 19-year-old Jorge Cruz, one of the disappeared students. 'We are not going to allow this case to be closed.'

The students, who were aspiring teachers attending a training college, vanished on September 26 and were attacked - allegedly under orders from detained, former mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife.

DNA tests were able to only positively identify the remains of one of the students, which leaves little hope of finding the remaining missing students, pictured

Lawyer Vidulfo Rosales, who is representing the families, presented a ten-point argument explaining why they believe the investigation must continue. The argument included a lack of conclusive forensic results. 

DNA tests were able to only positively identify the remains of one of the students, which leaves little hope of finding the remaining missing students. An Austrian laboratory assisting in the case has said it appears impossible to identify the others.

'We the parents repudiate the way in which today the attorney general has sought to close the investigation,' said Felipe de la Cruz, a spokesman for the relatives.

'We are not going to allow them to conclude or close the investigation,' he added, surrounded by activists and desperate parents. 

The latter are clinging to the belief that the students remain alive and are in the custody of Mexican security forces.

His people do not want the probe to be closed because so far only one set of remains corresponds to those of the missing students, according to de la Cruz.

Rosales noted that a number of key suspects remain at large. If detained, their testimony could shed new light on the official version of how the ordeal occurred. 

The families are set to bring forward a formal complaint on February 3 before the Committee on Enforced Disappearances at the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The Mexican government 'will have to respond for these events,' said Rosales.

The conclusion was based on the testimony of a suspect arrested two weeks ago who said he was called to get rid of the students, in addition to 39 confessions, 386 declarations, 487 forensic tests, 16 raids and two reconstructions.

The investigation has determined that a man named Felipe Rodriguez, arrested January 15, gave key testimony to the effect that the students were identified as members of Los Rojos, rivals of the Guerreros Unidos.

Detainees in the crime said there were at least three from Los Rojos infiltrated among the missing students. But prosecutors have no proof of this.

Prosecutors said Rodriquez was the head of the Guerreros Unidos hitmen squad and gave the order to kill the students. He and other suspects will be charged with murder. 

So far 99 people have been detained in connection with the crime including Abarca.

Families of the students questioned the testimony of detained suspects, taking into consideration Mexican authorities' track record of coercing confessions. 

The case has sparked widespread protests in the four months since the students disappeared and forced the government to turn its attention from touting economic and education reforms to dealing with crime and insecurity

Murillo Karam denied that the army participated in or allowed the killings to happen, as victims' relatives have claimed.

The case has continued to spark widespread protests in the four months since the students disappeared and forced the government to turn its attention from touting economic and education reforms to dealing with crime and insecurity.

The attorney general's response did not help to quell the controversy.

'They pretty much gave the same story as they had given two months ago. There are not many additional details,' said analyst Alejandro Hope. 'They are searching for closure but I'm not sure they're going to get it.' 

Hope said the protests will likely continue while there is no unimpeachable evidence that the remains belong to the students. 

It also remains unclear why the gang members would think the students were rivals, and why they would have killed them even after learning they were not.

'We know the who, the what, the when and the where. We don't know the why,' Hope said. 'They have yet to tell a compelling story of why this happened. It doesn't matter how many people they detain - unless they answer that question, the whole thing will remain under a halo of mystery.'
