Garry Monk has described his old pal and mentor Brendan Rodgers as the ‘perfect man’ to lead Liverpool, calling him an ‘inspiration’.

That affection will be temporarily forgotten on Monday evening when Liverpool host Swansea at Anfield.

But such is the friendship between Rodgers and the former defender he managed at Swansea, the Liverpool boss has agreed to let Monk’s side use their Melwood training ground before next Saturday’s FA Cup tie at Tranmere.

Garry Monk has praised his friend and mentor Brendan Rodgers as an inspiration ahead of Swansea's visit to Liverpool in the Premier League on Monday evening

Monk said: ‘We have Liverpool, a game against QPR and then Tranmere away in the Cup. After we play QPR we travel straight to Liverpool and I asked if we can use the facilities there. He said 'yes'.

‘He is a fantastic manager and a person I look up to. We chat regularly about football and everything. It is something I aspire to, with what he has done in his career.

‘He was at Reading and Watford and here and within a couple of years was managing Liverpool. He is an inspiration to someone like myself.’

The tables have turned somewhat, with Swansea leading Liverpool in the standings. Monk has vastly exceeded expectations in his first season as permanent manager, while Rodgers has endured a tough time.

But there has been a recent upturn, with Monk saying: ‘Brendan is one of the most mentally strong people I know. He is the perfect man for that job.

‘Every manager will go through difficult moments — I know I will — and he is coming through it and producing good results and the team are playing a lot better,’ he added.
