Facebook will from today  allow users to appoint an ‘online executor’ of their profile to decide what happens to it after they die.

The ‘Legacy Contact’ will be able to administer the page after you pass away by writing one last post and even approving new friend requests.

They will also be able to update your cover and profile photo meaning you have no say in what your final image will be, even if the image is embarrassing.

US-based Facebook has revealed a method to update your page after you die. Users can now name a 'Legacy Contact' (shown) to take over their account. The 'heir' will not have access to everything but can change key details. For example, your profile can be changed, and they can send a final status

Facebook said that the feature will work in the same way as a real-life executor of a will, only for your online profile.

The Legacy Contact will be able to close down your profile, keep it frozen as a memorial or leave it as it is.

However it risks confusing people who may think that their loved one is still alive if they respond to a friend request.

- Open your settings. Choose Security and then Legacy Contact at the bottom of the page.

- After choosing your legacy contact, you’ll have the option to send a message to that person.

- You may give your legacy contact permission to download an archive of the posts, photos and profile info you’ve shared on Facebook.

- Facebook has also redesigned memorialised profiles to pay tribute to the deceased by adding 'Remembering' above their name and making it possible for their legacy contact to pin a post to the top of their Timeline.

-Legacy Contacts will be introduced in the US first and then expand to more countries. Setting up a Legacy Contact is completely optional. 

Other issues which may arise are when family members cannot reach Legacy Contacts - or if they are ex-husbands or ex-wives with an axe to grind.

Facebook, which has 890 million users worldwide, said that it was responding to hundreds of thousands of requests for this kind of feature.

Like other social media companies it is trying to respect the wishes of the dead whilst also being sensitive to their families.

Facebook product manager Vanessa Callison-Burch said: ‘We heard from family members who wanted to post funeral information or download and preserve photos.

‘We realised there was more we could do.’

Until now when family or friends told Facebook that a user had died, the company verified the death and ‘memorialised’ the account.

This meant that it could be viewed but not edited, Miss Callison-Burch said.

But starting today,  users choose a Legacy Contact from their friends list under the security settings menu and they can take over.

When somebody dies Facebook will put the tagline ‘Remembering’ over the user's name and notify the appointed Legacy Contact.

The Legacy Contact can then download a copy of what they have shared on Facebook, though this does not include private messages.

The Legacy Contact will not be able to log into a person’s account and remove or change past posts, photos and other things shared on a person’s Timeline.

They will also not be able to delete friends, Facebook said.

The Wall St Journal reported that the changes are being rolled out to US users first with the rest of the world following suit.

The announcement was mocked on US TV and on NBC’s Today show they joked that people will update their status as ‘dead’.

Facebook has in the past been criticised for its 'Year in Review' feature which dredged up unhappy memories of the past 12 months including breakups.

On Twitter many thought that the Legacy Contact feature may be going too far.

Quinn Warnick wrote: 'Designated my wife as my "legacy contact” on Facebook in case I die. Nope, that didn’t feel weird AT ALL'.

And Hannah Hannah Cushma wrote: 'btw Facebook's canned designated legacy contact notification message ends "Please let me know if you want to talk about this."' 

From Facebook to Instagram, we spend an increasing amount of time documenting our lives on the internet.

Now there’s a service that claims to allow people to set up an ‘online tomb’ so they can create their own web-based memorial to show themselves in the best light after death too.

The satirical service, called EverTomb costs from $1 a month and lets users add new features so the digital tombs will ‘evolve to a great and probably creepy memorial of your online existence.’

The Amsterdam-based start-up’s website says that tombs can also be used during their owner's lifetime.

It reads: ‘Your tomb lets followers connect with you in the social afterlife and make some beautiful offerings.’

Essentially, it offers users the chance to make a memorial for themselves, despite being alive.

Currently there are no examples of what these tombs may look like, but 202 people have signed up so far.

The satirical site includes instructions, such as: ‘Let people know that you died online or just prepare for the afterlife like a great digital Pharaoh.’
