A Russian schoolboy watched a drunk man walk onto a frozen lake and drown when he fell through the ice - but instead of trying to rescue him, he filmed the drama and strolled away.

Moscow police are now hunting for the amateur cameraman after he posted the shocking footage on the internet.

The last part of video, apparently filmed on a mobile phone, includes what is believed to be the youngster's voice saying: 'That's it, the man is certainly dead.'

The schoolboy had been walking along the cycle path that runs alongside the city's Clean Ponds area at the weekend.

He spotted the drunk staggering across the ice and started to film.

The ice quickly gave way and the man fell through it. The water initially came up to the man's waist before the slab he was standing on slipped away and he disappeared.

Instead of rushing to help, the youngster carried on filming, hiding the camera as other people who were further away ran towards the lake.

The other onlookers are thought to have been alerted to the accident when a woman was heard screaming that a man was drowning.

But those who tried to come to his rescue arrived too late - the man had already vanished beneath the surface.

Police recovered the body but have not yet identified the man.

A post-mortem confirmed that the man had been drinking heavily before he died.

The man then sank in the ice to his death. Police are looking for the schoolboy after the video was posted online

The boy then left the scene and carried on with his walk. At the end of the video a voice says 'That's it, the man is certainly dead'
