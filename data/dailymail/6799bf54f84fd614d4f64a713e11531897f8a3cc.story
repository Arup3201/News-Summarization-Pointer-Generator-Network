Airline-style checklists are to be introduced on hospital wards – as new figures reveal three patients a day are dying due to blunders.

Modelled on pilots’ pre-flight checks, the new system will ensure everyone knows what is meant to be happening, so that fatal mistakes are not made.

Hospitals in England paid compensation over 1,078 deaths last year.

That cost taxpayers £58 million – the highest sum in at least five years – according to the NHS Litigation Authority.

Separate statistics show there have been 56 ‘never events’ – errors so serious they should never happen – across the NHS in England in the past three months alone. 

They include the case of a healthy kidney being removed from a woman after it was wrongly identified as an ectopic pregnancy.

Peter Walsh, of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, warned that ‘thousands more patients’ were probably dying every year because of hospital blunders and that the 1,078 deaths were ‘just the tip of the iceberg’.

Former pilot Martin Bromiley, whose wife Elaine died in 2005 after a series of errors during a routine nose operation, helped develop the checklist system.

He said: ‘Just as an aircraft is dependent on every crew member, ground staff and air traffic control, patients are dependent on every member of the hospital care team.’

The initiative is being piloted by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh with funding from the Heath Foundation.
