It's a secretive nation which very rarely lets outsiders in. However, this amazing time-lapse video offers a rare glimpse into the incredibly guarded lives of North Korea so few get to see.

Only 6,000 tourists visit the Communist country each year and British photographer and filmmaker Rob Whitworth was one of them, as he was granted permission to make the movie.

A collaboration between Mr Whitworth and JT Singh, a branding specialist focused on cities, has resulted in footage that offers a rare visual journey inside North Korea's capital - Pyongyang.

The 32-year-old from Norwich, who is currently based in Shanghai, China, was backed by North Korean travel company Koryo Tours to make the video which is presented as an invitation to explore the hermetic city.

Packaged in a sleek time-lapse format, the incredible footage is an attempt to view North Korea in a positive light.

To ensure everything went smoothly, the filmmakers 
were chaperoned every step of the way on their journey around the North Korean capital - and were banned from shooting 
construction sites or anyone in the army.

However Mr Whitworth said he was given full editorial control over the video footage, which was originally posted on Vimeo.

He said: ‘At no point did we have to pretend to be supporters of the government or their philosophy in order to be granted permission to shoot this film.

‘Amazingly, we were given complete editorial control in the making of this piece.’

The footage offers viewers an insight into a country, which has drawn condemnation for torturing dissenters and carrying out capital punishment.

The
 camera sweeps through an office full of workers staring at computer 
screens, although internet access is only permitted with special 
authorisation and primarily for government purposes.

The intriguing footage covers the everyday, pausing to take stock of a man getting his ticket out to use the underground, while some shots of children in a sunny skate park show the lighter side if life inside North Korea.

Token frames of the towering statues of the former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are included, as are shots of the country’s immaculately dressed policemen and women.

Mr Whitworth said: ‘The average visitor to Pyongyang is likely to be surprised by the scenes they encounter and are especially surprised about how clean and orderly the city actually is.

‘Indeed, people living in Pyongyang and other major cities enjoy a higher quality of life than those in other parts of the county.'
