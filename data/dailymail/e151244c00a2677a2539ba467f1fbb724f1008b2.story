Charged: Solomon Yemane-Berhane, 21, allegedly tried to steal two beers but lost his clothing instead 

A man from Oregon attempted to rob a convenience store of two beers and lost his most of his clothing in the process earlier this month.

Solomon Yemane-Berhane, 21, was stripped down to his boxer shorts during a fight with the owners of the Best Mart in Beaverton on November 9 after he allegedly tried snagging two beers from the cooler.

In surveillance footage of the three minute battle, the owners of the store can be seen grabbing him in attempt to stop him from walking out the door.

Berhane finally manages to escape the owners' grips and runs out the store wearing nothing but his boxer shorts.

After scampering off, the half-naked suspect was arrested by police nearby and no one was injured, reports Oregon Live.

Berhane was charged with resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, third-degree robbery, third-degree criminal mischief, third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault.

In the surveillance footage, the owner can be seen trying to stop Berhane from leaving the store with two stolen beers. She calls her husband to help detain the alleged thief.

Oregon Live reports that the owner recognized Berhane because she refused to sell him beer a week before and he smashed some bottles on the ground.

When Berhane entered the shop he was wearing a hat, jacket, t-shirt, and sneakers but rapidly begins losing items of clothing during the scuffle.

At one point the owners try to pin him to the counter but he starts flinging candy off the shelves in attempt to break free.

Finally after successfully escaping from the store, Berhane goes back inside one more time to grab his pants.
