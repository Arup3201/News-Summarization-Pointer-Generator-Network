A homeless man hospitalized in Brazil after a random attack has a best friend in his dog who waited eight days in the hospital parking lot until being able to see him.

Lauri da Costa, of Passo Fundo, staggered to a hospital after being smashed in the face with a rock only to be told he had melanoma on his face that had to be operated on immediately.

His dog Seco stayed outside in the parking lot, likely expecting him to return soon. His owner instead was inside eight days until they were reunited.

Good dog!: Seco waited outside the hospital for owner da Costa for eight days while he recovered

Seco sat patiently out front of the hospital waiting for da Silva to emerge, but he didn’t, according to a local news report translated by The Dodo.

The man was hospitalized while waiting to have the surgery – hours turned into days and days into more than a week.

Staff eventually began feeding Seco and giving him water while the loyal pooch waited for da Costa.

His owner was still recovering from surgery when the pair were reunited for a few minutes.

Pure joy: Seco and da costa couldn't have been happier to see each other

The dog jumped around wagging its tail and smelling da Silva, almost in disbelief it finally saw him again.

Seco licked da Costa’s face and jumped into his lap while furiously wagging his tail.

The bandaged, recovering man flashed several smiles at his loyal companion.

The man will not be discharged for some time, according to the report, but Seco has resumed waiting for his owner – proving he is man’s best friend.
