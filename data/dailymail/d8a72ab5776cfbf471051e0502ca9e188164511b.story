This was such a sublime obliteration that towards the end of it, Roger Federer’s many worshippers were cheering on Paolo Lorenzi — a little-known Italian without a prayer — in the hope that he could prolong their entertainment.

When Lorenzi won a game he smiled and saluted the crowd. When he won a point it was met by loud applause. He even saved five match points. The only  problem was that he won too few points and too few games and Federer was predictably victorious.

There was to be no repeat of last year’s humbling of a great champion; Federer’s watch-through-your-fingers second-round defeat by Sergiy Stakhovsky, a Ukrainian who was 116 in the world.

Easy win: Roger Federer made short work of Paolo Lorenzi on day of Wimbledon

Praise me: Federer, still a darling of Wimbledon, takes the acclaim of the crowd on Court One

No, the great Federer won with a big 
ace down the middle and duly put Wimbledon back on its axis here. It took him 24 minutes to win the first set and 1hr 33min to 
complete the job. But for Lorenzi’s fleeting, late obduracy, Federer 
could have been back home to share a late lunch with his newly-expanded 
family.

His wife Mirka was 
in Court One, clapping her man. The two sets of twins, Myla and 
Charlene, aged four, and Leo and Lenny, aged seven weeks, were waiting 
for Super Dad back at their base down the road.

‘It’s
 nice having the family with you as much as possible,’ he said. ‘They 
know I play a lot of tennis. I don’t know if they understand it is a 
job. They know I play for a trophy and all that stuff.’

The
 chances of siring two sets of identical twins have been estimated at 
one in 700,000 but what of Federer, 32, winning an eighth Wimbledon 
title? In doing that he would become the oldest champion here in the 
modern era, beating 31-year-old Arthur Ashe in 1975.

There
 were no more than clues in what we saw in this first-round match but we
 can say that the Swiss’s recent upturn in form  continues. The back 
problems and his patchy form of a year ago were nowhere to be seen.

Imperious: Federer serves on his way to victory at what has become his second home

VIDEO Wimbledon Day 2 review

If
 he has lost a little speed  with age, the delicacy of his shot- making 
endures. He said his larger racket head has given him more power on his 
serve.

He volleyed more than
 in recent years, moving to the net regularly and confidently, and 
declaring that ‘it could be that little extra piece to the puzzle’.

‘I
 didn’t serve and volley all the time,’ said Federer, who has worked on 
the tactic with his coach Stefan Edberg. ‘That’s not how I intend to 
play. But mixing it up a little bit could be the way to go.’

Something
 of the ego still sparkles, even if last year’s defeat and the rise of 
Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have stripped away part of 
his numinous aura. The white and gold blazer was nowhere to be seen; he 
was merely in immaculate white.

No answer: Lorenzi was outclassed by former champion Federer

Immaculate
 is a good word for Federer, unlike the official notes issued to
 us hacks, which described him as ‘the defending champion’. Oh dear.

Tougher challenges await, starting with the big-serving Gilles Muller tomorrow. But for now the great Rodge is content.

‘I served well, returned well and came forward a bit,’ he said. ‘I could really do everything out there.’
