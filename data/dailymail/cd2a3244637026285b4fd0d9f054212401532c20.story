Under attack: Sue Sim's hair and makeup were mocked

The police officer who was taunted for looking like Margaret Beckett and a Wallace and Gromit character has hit back at the sexist jokes made at her expense as she led the Raoul Moat manhunt.

Northumbria Police chief constable Sue Sim said she found the comments about her hair and makeup hurtful and doubted they would have been made if she was a 'short, fat man'.

Speaking yesterday at the North East Women Leaders' conference in Newcastle she said the hurtful jibes had tarnished the most important moment of her career, while she sought to track down the killer.

'It was quite hurtful to read what 
the media said about my hair and make-up, and them making comparisons 
with Margaret Beckett,' she said.

'I can't imagine that they would have done the same if I was a short fat man.'

While Ms Sim was holding public appeals 
and interviews during the gunman's rampage, she was showered with cruel 
jokes, frequently appearing on the front pages of national newspapers 
alongside snide remarks about her appearance.

She
was compared to Labour MP and former foreign secretary Margaret 
Beckett, and Lady Totting from the Wallace and Gromit film Curse of the 
Were-Rabbit.

Ms Sim told the audience of local 
female sixth-form students how, despite the barrage of sexist comment, she 
knew she just had to 'get on with it'.

At six foot tall, the chief constable towers over a number of her male colleagues and is used to standing her ground.

She
said: 'I work in a male dominated environment, so there have been 
obstacles simply because I'm a woman, but it also helps that I'm a six 
foot woman, so that makes it easier to stand my ground.

'But I had an important job to and I had to get on with it.'

The event at Newcastle Business 
School brought together successful women from industry, the arts and the
community to inspire female sixth formers from around the region.

While Ms Sim led the manhunt for Raoul Moat, the officer leading the operation was mocked about her make up

The
police chief led the manhunt which ended in violent Moat shooting 
himself after a standoff with police officers who tried to negotiate 
with him in July last year.

During the operation, which began on 
July 3 after Moat killed the boyfriend of his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, people went online to mock the chief constable's wavy hair 
and features.

But Ms Sim told the young women that she had to shake off the ridicule and focus on her job, rather than the hurtful criticism.

She said: 'It is your responsibility and your choice to make sure you do what you want to do.

'You have to be able to promote yourself, be confident in your own abilities and you have to be prepared to say "yes".'

500 sixth formers from schools across the North East were invited to attend the event.

Lauren Timmins, 16, from Burnside Business and Enterprise College in Wallsend, said: 'I feel more confident about my future after listening to the women speak here.

'It's been really interesting and very inspiring.'
