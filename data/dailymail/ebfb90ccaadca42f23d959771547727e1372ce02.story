A retired police officer stopped and held a man at gunpoint after witnessing him pull a knife on another man in Salt Lake City.

The former officer, who gave his name only known as 'Nick', believed he was breaking up a serious fight, however it turned out the man with the knife had his bike stolen, and was trying to threaten the thug that had stolen it.

Not knowing this, Nick pulled over and produced his weapon.

'I told him to lay down on the ground and he stayed there,' he told Fox 13 News.  

Scene: The retired officer, Nick (right), was driving by when he saw his man (left) threatening another with a knife, so he decided to produce his own gun

911: While holding the suspect at gunpoint, Nick was able to call police and tell them the address

Back-up: Police arrived at the scene around two minutes after Nick called, and took over the situation

While some people stopped after seeing what was happening, Nick said no one helped him.

Some started filming the scene, and one witness can be heard telling Nick to stop.

'He's not going to do nothing put the gun down, he's not going to do nothing, put the gun down,' the witness can be heard saying in the video.

The witness added: 'At this point an accident could happen, he's on the floor, there's a bunch of us out here, there's no need for you to be pointing a gun to a man's back whose face is on the floor.'

However Nick maintains he handled the situation correctly. 

'It could have turned out ugly if I didn't have experience or I didn't have the training,' Nick said.

'Nobody called 911, nobody reported it, they are all worried about getting video so they could be famous or whatever they are.'

Retired: Nick, a former police officer, said he was surprised that no one that stopped at the scene did not help him, even by calling 911

At one point the suspect pleaded for his life.

'Don't shoot me,' the suspect is heard saying in the video, Fox 13 reported.

'I'm not gonna,' Nick is heard saying in response.

'You are too, get that gun off me,' the suspect added.

Nick had the gun on the man for about two minutes before a police car arrived. 

It is unclear why the suspect was armed with a knife in the first place, however he told police that his bike had been stolen and he was trying to get it back.

The suspect declined to press charges again Nick.

Salt Lake City police recommended civilians avoid getting involved in altercations.

They said being a good witness is calling police.
