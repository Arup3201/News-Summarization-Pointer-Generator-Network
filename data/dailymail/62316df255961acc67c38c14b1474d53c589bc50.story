The grieving parents of a teenager who was mysteriously found dead inside a gym mat could face charges after they staged a protest over the lack of information about his death.

Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson and five family members are facing a host of charges - including interference with government property for allegedly blocking an entrance to a Georgia courthouse.

It is alleged that the Johnsons stood in front of the Lowndes County Courthouse in Valdosta, Georgia, and  the security checkpoint inside the building.

But the group said that they were only there to demonstrate after becoming frustrated at the lack of information from investigators about their 17-year-old son, Kendrick's death.

Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia was reported missing on January 10, 2013 and found the next day dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes High School.

Police interviewed some of the former wrestler's fellow teammates as his parents call into question the alibi of one student.

CNN reports that the student, who has not been named, confronted Johnson and told him 'it ain't over' after an incident between Johnson and the younger brother of the former student.

While he was said to have been at a wrestling match at another school at the time of Johnson's death, lawyers are now saying the bus had not left yet at the time of Johnson's death. 

Kendrick Johnson's parents, maintain that their son's death was not an accident.

They have filed a $100 million lawsuit alleging his classmates beat him to death- naming 37 people, including local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants.

According to CNN, attorney Chevene King said the Johnsons have been kept in the dark about events regarding their son's death at the South Georgia high school.

In footage posted on YouTube authorities arrested several family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. 

Meanwhile, another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. 

The family and others can be heard chanting, 'No justice, no peace,' as officers step in to arrest them.

The relatives, who call themselves the 'KJ 7,' were arrested and released on bond in the April 25, 2013, incident, King said. 

Shortly after her release, Jacquelyn Johnson told WCTV, 'I'm going to be right back out at the courthouse in the morning, ready to do it all over again, until we get justice.'

But in a twist of fate, each of the seven family members could now face up to a year in prison, and a $1,000 fine.

In May 2013, the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office announced it was closing its investigation into Johnson's death.

It claimed that  Johnson had slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe and got stuck. 

An autopsy completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation concluded Johnson died of accidental positional asphyxia.

Months later, a pathologist hired by the Johnsons conducted a second autopsy, found evidence of 'unexplained,  non-accidental blunt force trauma' to his neck which signaled a homicide.

In October 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched a federal investigation, which is ongoing.
