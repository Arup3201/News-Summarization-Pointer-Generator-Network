This day was always likely to come; it was just a question of how soon. Sam Burgess is back in an England shirt again - this time in the code he is still hurriedly attempting to crack.

When the Saxons take on the savagely-titled Ireland ‘Wolfhounds’ in Cork on Friday night, there will be all manner of Test players involved in what is, sadly, a rare ‘A’-team international match.

In a World Cup year, so many fringe candidates for national service require these occasions to press their case, but most countries have dispensed with second-string sides - leaving a giant leap between the Under 20s and the senior ranks.

Stuart Lancaster is going over especially to watch proceedings in person, and he will closely monitor the likes of Matt Mullan and Rob Webber in the front row, Matt Kvesic at openside, rising Exeter sensation Henry Slade at No 10 and two established Test wings in Chris Ashton and Marland Yarde. But so much of the interest and the intrigue building up to this fixture has focused on league convert Burgess, who has been on a crash-course in union at Bath.

The RFU are alert to the fascination, given the way the Yorkshireman has been prominent in all their news bulletins about the game, while there is curiosity in Ireland about the visitors’ rookie inside centre with the superstar profile. It was the same in Toulouse earlier this month, where Burgess dominated discussions about Bath, before he was ruled out of the Champions Cup encounter.

While there are countless cynics keen to pour scorn on his efforts to learn a whole new ball game in time to become a World Cup contender, the England management are not in that category. Burgess is firmly in their thoughts and while a strong performance on Friday night won’t thrust him into immediate Six Nations plans, he may be invited to join the senior squad to acclimatise to the surroundings.

As an 18-stone-plus power runner who can off-load and tackles like a runaway train, his rise to the top of his new sport is surely a matter of time, as was Friday night’s preliminary taster. The proud patriot is relishing his first Red Rose outing, saying: ‘It’s great to be representing the country again and I’m looking forward to it. You don’t get too many chances to sing the anthem so you have to make the most of it every time you have the chance.’

The Six Nations is not a target Burgess has in mind, as it has come too soon in his development phase. ‘I think it’s a bit premature,’ he added. Maybe it is, but on Friday night he can accelerate his second England career.

When the official RBS Six Nations twitter account made its latest reference to ‘rugby’s greatest championship’ on Tuesday, the account for the southern-hemisphere Rugby Championship bit back. The riposte was a wide-eyed face with ‘*coughs*’ alongside. That was it; a subtle attempt to put Europe’s blue-riband event in its place. It was also fair comment.

Every year, in these parts, we savour the thunderous tribal intensity of the annual neighbourly clashes, but purely in terms of playing standards, the SANZAR elite and Argentina deliver a superior product. In terms of the overall package; of atmosphere and colour, fervent cross-border tension and historical needle, not to mention the weekend festivals of revelry in the host cities, the Six Nations is top dog.

But what it needs in this World Cup year is to deliver heightened, trend-setting on-field standards, tactical innovations and new peaks of athletic prowess. It needs Scotland and Italy to compete and it needs France to start equating to the sum of their parts again. If it has all of that and a fierce title fight, it can start using the ‘greatest’ claim with greater conviction.

Bristol’s heavily-financed quest to return to the Aviva Premiership is bringing out director of rugby Andy Robinson’s ruthless streak. The former England and Scotland coach has banished wing Andy Short from the club, after the 23-year-old agreed to join promotion rivals Worcester at the end of the season.

With the two clubs destined for a two-leg showdown in the Championship Final in May, Robinson has ruled that Short’s decision to return to his home-town club means he is no longer welcome in the squad - for matches or even at training. ‘I need players who are 100 per cent committed in mind and body,’ he said.

‘I felt that a player who was going to a rival, who we are potentially playing in the play-off final, I thought was unacceptable. With the quality that we have in the side, he won’t be missed.’ Robinson has never sugar-coated his words, but even by his standards that is a blunt parting shot. On his watch, Bristol will evidently take no prisoners…

International comeback story of the week - Nick Easter described his meeting with Stuart Lancaster, which confirmed his recall to the England squad. ‘It was in the pub in Ascot,’ he said.

‘He probably thought it was my second home given my “old-school” tag! It’s a pub called The Stag. I didn’t actually know he was in there. There was a bar, a few stools and a fireplace there and I was 25 minutes early. I thought, “Well he is not here” so I went to the loo and ordered a drink, then he sort of appeared from around the corner.’

Asked what drink he had chosen, the Harlequins No 8 - without missing a beat - quipped: ‘I ordered a pint with a triple-whiskey chaser!’

Last Word

It’s been a week of eye-catching retirement announcements. Mark Cueto will stand down from all rugby at the end of the season, with no doubt about the timing of his move into a commercial role at Sale - the club he has served with distinction throughout his career.

While the 35-year-old wing may be best remembered for his ruled-out ‘try’ in the 2007 World Cup Final, he is the all-time leading try-scorer in Premiership rugby, whose current tally of 87 may stand as the benchmark for years to come, if Wasps’ Tom Varndell can’t surpass it.

Meanwhile, Adam Jones has called time on his Wales career after being left out of the Six Nations squad. The Blues prop and decorated Lion was wounded by his omission, but this column would consider a small wager on him playing for his country again.

Even his successor, Samson Lee of the Scarlets, remains in awe of the man known affectionately as ‘Bomb’, saying: ‘It’s unbelievable how much Adam has achieved and he is, I reckon, still Wales’ best tighthead.’

For now, that may not be the coaches’ view, but don’t bet against a re-think if injuries take hold.
