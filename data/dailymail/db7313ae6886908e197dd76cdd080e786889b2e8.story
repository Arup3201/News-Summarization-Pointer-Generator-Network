A schoolboy has stunned medics by fighting back from the brink of death on two separate occasions in just over a year.

Kyle Reeve, 14, fractured his skull in a bike accident in June 2011, leaving him in a coma on a life support machine.

Doctors told his family he might not pull through but, amazingly, he recovered from his injuries and was sent home.

Then in August of this year, the teenager fell victim to a potentially deadly form of meningitis that caused unconsciousness and seizures. Again doctors feared for his life, and his mother said they told her Kyle might have contracted the condition due to his earlier skull fracture.

Mother Nicky, from Alvaston, Derbyshire, recalls how the nurses who helped save Kyle’s life before could not believe he was back in hospital. 'They didn’t think he’d make it. It was like history repeating itself.'

But battling Kyle pulled through and has now gone back to school.

Intensive care: After breaking his skull in a BMX accident, Kyle was in a coma on life support for three days

Nicky kept a vigil at her son’s hospital bedside in June 2011 after he fractured his skull falling off his bike.

'I remember seeing Kyle playing on a climbing frame and I told him to get down as I didn’t want him to get hurt.

'Then later he went out with his friends on his bike and I got a call asking me to pick him up because he’d come off the bike.

'I was scared he’d died and went straight down there. When we got to Alvaston Park he was lying on the floor and looked quite a mess.

'In the ambulance, his eyes started rolling back in his head. He was fighting and kicking. It was horrible. He kept trying to get up and get the collar off his neck.'

Kyle was taken straight to the accident and emergency department at the Royal Derby Hospital and had tests and X-rays.

He had suffered a fractured skull and was taken to the intensive care unit of Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham. He stayed in a coma and was on life support for three days.

Nicky says: 'I waited there and spoke to him. I was there every day and I only came home to get changed. They tried to wake him up from the coma but his body wasn’t ready for it so they put him back to sleep.'

Kyle stayed on the ward for five days before being discharged. The recovery stunned medical staff and Nicky: 'We expected to be in the hospital for more than a month. He was there just over a week. They called him a miracle boy.'

Struck down: Kyle returned to school after the bike accident, only to contract meningitis a year later

Kyle eventually returned to his life as a student at Noel-Baker Community School, where teachers gradually introduced him back into lessons.

Nicky said: 'Noel-Baker were really good. They kept in contact with me on the phone to let me know how he was getting on. I was really nervous when he went back to school but Kyle just wanted to do what he always did and carry on as normal. He wouldn’t let anything stop him.

'We noticed after the accident that there was a heart-shaped bloodstain on the T-shirt he was wearing during the accident, just above where his heart is. We were so glad he was back at home and well again.'

'Like history repeating itself': Doctors told Kyle's mother Nicky, right, that her son was unlikely to recover from the meningitis

But in August 2012 Kyle became unwell after staying at his sister’s house for a few days.

Nicky says: 'I went round to check on him and he was struggling to walk and started feeling weaker. His eye, near to where he had fractured his skull the year before, started to get bigger and bigger. He started having seizures. We moved him but it was like lifting a dead weight. There was no movement in him whatever.'

Once again, paramedics rushed Kyle to the Royal Derby Hospital.

'In the ambulance they said ‘you have a very poorly boy here.

'We went to the emergency room. They told me they thought it was meningitis.

'I asked them if I would lose him. They didn’t think he’d make it. It was like history repeating itself.

'A team from the Queen’s Medical Centre came to the Royal Derby to examine Kyle. They said he was really poorly and had to take him to the intensive care unit at the Queen’s Medical Centre. The staff there couldn’t believe he was back again.'

Kyle was diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis, which is rare in children of his age. It causes the membranes around the brain and spine to swell.

Despite the severity of his condition, Kyle again amazed medics by being discharged from hospital just over a week later.

'The infection might have been caused by a hairline fracture still left in his skull from the BMX accident', speculates Nicky.

Kyle is now back at school and leading as normal a life as possible.

He said: 'When I first fell off my BMX my life flashed before my eyes. It went pitch black. I can’t remember anything. It was all black to me.

'I’ve promised my family I will stay out of trouble from now on.'
