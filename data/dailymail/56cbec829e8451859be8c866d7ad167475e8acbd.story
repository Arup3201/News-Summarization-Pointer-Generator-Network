Calum Best has suffered from hair loss since his early twenties and today reveals the results of his third hair transplant.

The Celebrity Big Brother star, 33, had two transplants but his hair continued to fall out, so he has now undergone his third in just two years.

Model Calum confesses that thinning locks ate away at his confidence until he could see no way out but to fork out on a third operation.

Calum Best today reveals the results of his third hair transplant

Calum, who is the son of late football legend George Best,  has had three £6,000 procedures in the last two years to keep hold of his hair - and he's not ruling out a fourth if hair continues to fall out.

The actor and reality star from Fulham, London, says that without the surgical help, he would have lost most of the hair at the front of his scalp by now.

Speaking just before going on  Channel 5's Big Brother, Calum said: 'There is no doubt this has changed my life. I have been losing my hair since my early 20s.

'Nature's plan was for me to have thin and patchy hair across the top of my scalp. But the great thing is, we don't have to follow nature's plan.

'Hair transplant technology has improved so much in the last five years and I have been able to keep hold of all my hair and wear it in my the same way as I did when I was in my teens.

'I was keen to get it done before going on Celebrity Big Brother so my hair would look great on the show.'

He had two transplants but his hair continued to fall out, so he has had a third in just two years.

Model Calum confesses that thinning locks ate away at his body confidence

Calum had 1,200 grafts - around 2,200 individual hairs - moved from the side to the front of his scalp

Calum has had all three procedures with hair transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak at Crown Clinic in Manchester.

Dr Shahmalak is the hair loss expert on the Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies and he has also carried out two hair transplants on the programme's presenter Christian Jessen.

Calum could have potentially slowed down his hair loss by taking the clinically proven hair loss drug Propecia.

But two per cent of men who take the drug experience a dip in their sex drive - and Calum didn't want to take his chances.

'It may only be two guys in a 100 but I didn't want to take the risk,' he laughed. 

And although the costs are enormous, Calum said that keeping hold of his hair had done wonders for self-esteem - and has made him look five years younger.

He said: 'No man wants to be bald when he is older. 

'Losing your hair is one of the most demoralising things that can happen to a man as he ages. You don't feel nearly as good about yourself and it eats away at your body confidence.

'For me, I was worrying about my thinning hair when I was attending auditions. I would be thinking, "Have they seen my hair? Are they going to give me the job?"

'It was becoming a big distraction.

'I've read research saying that baldness can make men look 10 years older. I would say keeping hold of my hair has made me look at least five years younger. The difference in my self-esteem is immeasurable.'

His hair was still receding in this area, particularly at the temples

And Calum admitted that he wouldn't hesitate to have a fourth procedure if his hair loss continued.

He said: 'I'm not too interested in taking Propecia. Hair loss is a continual process but I am hoping that mine will level off as I approach my mid-30s.

'I would have a fourth procedure. But let's hope that is not necessary.

'Lots of other stars have had multiple procedures. James Nesbitt has had three and he looks amazing.

'Wayne Rooney has had two and it looks like he might well need a third.'

Calum had 1,200 grafts - amounting to around 2,200 individual hairs - moved from the side to the front of his scalp where his hair is still receding, particularly at the temples.

Dr Shahmalak, who specialises in treating celebrities, said Calum had the same Follicular Unit Extraction technique as England captain Wayne Rooney.

He said: 'What we've noticed in the last five years is that the age of our patients is coming down all the time. A third of men suffer hair loss by the time they are 30.

'More of them are deciding to have transplants immediately rather than waiting until middle age. Why suffer 20 years of loss of confidence if you can sort your problem now?

'For people in the public eye, their image is their career. You don't see a lot of bald models or TV presenters.

'A simple procedure such a hair transplant can make an enormous difference to a man's life. 

'We have seen a lot of men "doing a Rooney" and coming in for one, two or even three hair transplants like Calum. Bookings have gone up 25 per cent since Wayne went public.'

In October, Calum shaved off his enormous bushy beard as he prepared to undergo his third hair transplant in just two years. 

'Losing that beard has taken a decade off me,' he said. 'There is no doubt a beard ages you. People associate them with middle-aged men.'  

The star has already had two hair transplant procedures after first  losing his hair in his early 20s. 

He believes he damaged his hair follicles by pulling it back in a tight ponytail. He also thinks he hastened his hair loss by over-bleaching.  

Before his third transplant Calum said: 'All the transplanted hair is permanent - the problem I have is that I am still losing my natural hair.'

'These procedures have completely changed my life. They have given me so much more confidence and enabled me to wear my hair just the way I like.'

Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic in Manchester, said: 'Hair transplantation is the only method that is guaranteed to overcome hair loss and regain hair. Medications can halt hair loss but they will not lead to the regrowth of lost hair.

'There are two types of hair transplant. In both cases, transplantation can be done so well that often a barber or stylist cannot even tell that grafts have been placed. The transplanted hair is permanent and in nearly all cases will stay in place for the rest of the patient's life.

'The most popular and cost-effective method is called Follicular Unit Transplantation – popularly known as 'strip harvesting' - where hair follicles are removed in a 'strip' of skin from the back or side of the head and moved to the thinning areas at the top of the scalp.

'The second technique is called Follicular Unit Extraction. It is more expensive than strip harvesting and is the procedure which was used on Wayne Rooney for both his hair transplants.

The main difference is the hair follicles are removed and transplanted individually as opposed to in one single strip.

It is more time consuming – and therefore more expensive – than strip harvesting. This method is particularly popular with men who like to keep their hair short because there is virtually no scarring.

In Follicular Unit Extraction, or FUE, individual follicles are extracted directly from the back or side of scalp, usually one at a time.

There will be some minor scarring – which looks like pin pricks – immediately after the operation but this disappears during the healing process which takes approximately 5-7 days after which any redness or slight swelling in the treatment area will have subsided.

Gordon Ramsay had these red pin pricks at the back of his scalp following his FUE procedure earlier this year.

FUE generally has a quicker patient recovery time and lower post-operative discomfort than strip harvesting.

Calum also shaved off his beard as he prepared for his third hair transplant in two years
