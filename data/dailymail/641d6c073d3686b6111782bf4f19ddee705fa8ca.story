Wayne Rooney does not rank alongside the world's 'greatest players' Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and he has failed to fully 'maximise his potential', say Glenn Hoddle and Lee Dixon.

The England captain won his 100th cap for the Three Lions during Saturday's 2016 European Championship qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley.

Yet former England coach Hoddle and ex-Three Lions full back Dixon believe his 'great' career has not been quite as fantastic as many thought it would be when he broke on to the scene more than a decade ago.

Ex-England coach Glenn Hoddle (left) and former Three Lions full back Lee Dixon were not full of praise for England captain Rooney, saying he has failed to fulfil his full potential and is not one of the world's best

Speaking on ITV before the match, Dixon explained that Rooney's best position is still unclear despite receiving a century of caps - which is not something you associate with the world's greats.

He said: '(There were) huge expectations on him (Rooney). He was a talent straight from day one and I think everyone put a lot of pressure on him, including himself.

'Has he maximised his potential compared to how good he was when he was young? I think you'd have to say he hasn't.

'He's now won 100 caps but we still don't know what his best position is which is not what you associate with the game's greats, although he has achieved great things throughout his career.'

Hoddle, meanwhile, does not think Rooney ranks alongside the best players in the world and believes the Manchester United forward could even improve in the future.

He explained: 'He's had a great, great career but whether he's one of the greatest in the world alongside Messi and Ronaldo, I think he's just behind that.

'I think he can actually improve on his performances (in the future).'

Rooney's former team-mate Steven Gerrard and England coach Gary Neville were quick to praise the 29-year-old, however.

Neville said: 'What's a great (player)? (Rooney's been in) three European Cup finals, won five or six Premier League titles, he's England captain - I wouldn't have wanted more than that as a kid.

'He's Bryan Robson up front for me. Sometimes our problem (as an England set-up) with Rooney is he works too hard - he needs to make these next few years the best of his career.'

And Gerrard was also effusive in his praise for the striker: 'A few players operate on a different level and Wayne is one of them because he can do magical things.

'(The pressure on him) is his own fault for being so good. I'm just hoping he's going to be that person who is going to make all the fans happy at a tournament.'
