Police and paramedics were called to a funeral wake after a mass brawl broke out between mourners.

Around 10 people joined in the fighting which spilled into the street outside the home of the daughter of the late George Johnson, 83.

Grieving Denise Boden ended up being taken to hospital with a fractured hand and ribs and her grandson Carl Boden, 29, was arrested.

Denise yesterday claimed the row broke out when her husband Robert, 61, had an angina attack during the wake at their home in Deal, Kent.

Around 10 people were involved in a fight which spilled into the street outside the home of the daughter of the late George Johnson, 83. One woman was taken to hospital with a fractured hand and one man was arrested

She asked for space but tensions boiled over when mourners refused to budge.

Denise, 55, said she suffered a fractured hand in the brawl which involved around ten people.

She said: 'My husband was having breathing problems and that's how it started.

'He was having trouble breathing and someone wouldn't move back to give him some space and then it started kicking off.

'I tried to stop the fight and fractured my hand and ribs, and then me and my husband went in the ambulance.

'Nobody is talking to anybody in the family now. It might take some time before we can speak again.'

Denise insisted that no women were involved in the fight and added that they were trying to break it up.

She and her husband were treated at the scene as her husband did not wish to go to hospital. He is now recovering at home.

Kent Police said officers arrived at 5.50pm and remained at the scene for several hours taking statements.

He confirmed one man was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been bailed pending further inquiries until December 6.

South East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed one ambulance was sent to the scene.

He said: 'We were at the scene for well over an hour but no one required hospital treatment.

'There were facial injuries such as cuts to the mouth, nose and forehead and it involved around 10 people. We held back until police were on the scene.'
