Wannabe jetsetters can now hail a private plane anywhere in the world from their smartphones thanks to an app that makes luxury air travel more accessible, at least to those who can afford the £4,500 ($7,000) membership.

JetSmarter, the brain child of Sergey Petrossov, 26, allows
users to hire a jet in a matter of seconds. 

'Our goal as a company is to democratise private aviation,' he told Reuters in
Zurich, where the company will open a European office in 2015.

JetSmarter allows users to book a private jet from wherever they are in the world - but it won't come cheap

Launched in March last year, the app has been downloaded
over 300,000 times and facilitated more than 1,000 flights so
far in 2014.

While the average ticket costs around £12,750 ($20,000), those who
become members for £4,500 ($7,000) a year can get free or discounted 
'empty legs' flights, which travel empty when a plane returns to
its home base after dropping off passengers,

The average JetSmarter member is tech-savvy, aged between 25
and 50 and earns at least £650,000 ($1 million) a year, according to
Petrossov. 

The app is easy to use: You pick and customise your jet, then click book, pay, and you're away

A-list celebrities, royalty and sheikhs are among its
users.

Some of the most popular routes include the 'Golden
Triangle' between Miami, New York and Los Angeles. 

But almost
anything is possible. JetSmarter once received a request to
transport a tonne of gold between South America and Europe.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV earlier this year, Petrossov said: 'JetSmarter is an app that you can go on and access the entire inventory of private aircraft around the world.

The app has been downloaded over 300,000 times and facilitated more than 1,000 flights so far this year

'There are more than 3,000 aeroplanes on our app; it's literally as easy as putting in your itinerary, you pick the exact aircraft that you want, you see real photographs all amenities, insurance information and safety history.

'You press 'book,' put in your credit card, it's all cashless, paperless, people say "wow", they can't believe you can book a private jet through an app.'

The airplanes detailed in the app are controlled by vendors, which JetSmarter connect to via GPS to work out scheduling.
