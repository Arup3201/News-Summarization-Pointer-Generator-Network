Billie Jean King believes that the only barrier to Andy Murray becoming a serial Grand Slam winner is ‘between his ears’.

‘Andy is one of the greatest players who ever lived, the only thing that beats him is between his ears,’ said King. 

‘Otherwise he has got everything. I wish emotionally and mentally he could get it together more often because when he does he’s one of the all time greats.

‘He has more Slams in him. I don’t know how he is physically, he seems to get injured when he’s not doing well. But I’ve always loved him, I always said he could win Wimbledon, he’s extremely talented. I’d love to spend a bit of time with him.’

King, as a champion of women’s rights in sport, is fascinated by Murray’s appointment of Amelie Mauresmo as his coach. 

‘Because it’s visible it helps (the equality cause) but if she doesn’t do well it will be tough because there are so few,' King says.

'A lot of male coaches don’t do well and nobody says a word, I look forward to the day when it’s not a story. It’s who is best for him, green, purple, man or woman.’
