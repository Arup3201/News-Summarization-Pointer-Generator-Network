An 8m humpback whale has been freed after it spent days towing two large orange buoys behind it when its tail became entangled in rope.

On Thursday afternoon, a disentanglement team from Western Australia's Department of Parks and Wildlife successfully dislodged the whale after numerous attempts to free it, off the coast of Geraldton.

The Department of Fisheries and Kalbarri Volunteer Rescue also assisted the efforts.

An 8m Humpback whale had its tail entangled in a rope for days, towing along two orange buoys

The whale was first sighted on Sunday morning and then over the next two days off the coast of Western Australia

The whale was first sighted on Sunday morning, north of Kalbarri, and then over the next two days near Horrocks Beach, north of Geraldton.

In footage captured on-board the rescue boat, the whale appears to be dragging the vessel along as the crew figures out how to free it while it continues to swim in the ocean.

Initially the disentanglement team was sent out on Tuesday but was unable to carry out the rescue until late Thursday afternoon, 37km off the coast of Geraldton.

The whale had been re-sighted by Parks and Wildlife staff from the air.

Crews cut away the rope, setting the whale free, who is a strong swimmer and its prognosis is good

The Department of Parks and Wildlife, the Department Fisheries and Kalbarri Volunteer Rescue banded together to free the whale

Midwest regional manager Anthony Desmond said after first carefully assessing the animal, the disentanglement team was able to cut the rope away from the whale, allowing it to swim free.

'The ropes were wrapped twice around the whale’s peduncle area and around each of its tail flukes,' Mr Desmond said.

'It was a delicate operation as we were dealing with an animal that weighs thousands of kilograms, so it was important that human safety was addressed first.

'The team was able to cut it away using specialist equipment so it was a great result and the best possible outcome for this whale.

'We monitored the whale after the disentanglement and while it was very tired, it was swimming strongly and its prognosis is good.'

People who see an entangled or beached whale should keep a safe distance from the animal and contact the Department of Parks and Wildlife’s Wildcare Helpline on 9474 9055.
