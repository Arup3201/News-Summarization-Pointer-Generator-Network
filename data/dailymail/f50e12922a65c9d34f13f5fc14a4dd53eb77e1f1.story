A couple accused of plotting to abduct, torture and kill police to further their anti-authority ‘sovereign citizens’ movement told a Las Vegas judge today that they didn't recognize his authority to keep them in jail.

Justice of the Peace Conrad Hafen had none of it.

He made sure David Allen Brutsche, 42, and Devon Campbell Newman, 67, read the criminal complaints filed against them, then sent them back to jail pending a September 9 preliminary hearing on charges of felony conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and attempted kidnapping.

Rebel: Brutsche, who calls himself a 'sovereign citizen,' told Justice of the Peace Conrad Hafen that he does not recognize his authority

Plea for freedom: Newman asked the judge to release her on bail because she did not hurt anyone, but her request was denied

Police say Brutsche and Newman held training sessions about sovereign citizen philosophy, shopped for guns, found a vacant house and rigged it to bind captives to cross beams during interrogation, and recorded videos to explain their actions and why officers had to die.

The judge appointed a public defender to represent Brutsche, over his rambling objections, and set bail at $600,000, citing a criminal history including a sex offense involving a child under 14 and failure to appear in traffic cases.

‘I object to the entire proceedings of this court. For the record,’ Brutsche said.

Hafen named a lawyer to represent Newman and scheduled her bail hearing for Monday.

‘I've hurt no one. I wish to be released on bail,’ Newman said.

‘So noted,’ the judge responded. ‘Denied.'

Brutsche and Newman were arrested Thursday in a sting operation at an apartment a few miles off the Vegas Strip before they could carry out a plan to snatch officers, 'put them on trial' and execute them in a vacant house, police Lt. James Seebock said.

Federal authorities regard sovereign citizen extremists as domestic terrorists.

Authorities have linked sovereign citizens groups with violent confrontations in recent years, including deadly shootings in Louisiana and Arkansas.

Brutsche, 42, and Newman, 67, wanted to draw attention to the group's rejection of governmental authority, making the case a domestic terror plot, Seebock said.

'They were furthering their ''sovereign citizen'' ideology by committing criminal acts toward law enforcement,' he said.

The investigation began when an unidentified undercover officer befriended Brutsche and Newman in April, police said.

Radical views: Brutsche allegedly stated last month that 'sovereign citizens' need to arrest the police, throw them in jail and put them on trial in a people's court

‘The suspects believed that once the first kidnapping and execution was accomplished, they would be compelled to keep repeating their actions, kidnapping and killing multiple officers.’

The three participated in meetings and training sessions about sovereign citizen philosophy and later shopped for guns and discussed plans to track and videotape police officers to determine whom to abduct, according to a 10-page arrest report.

They found a vacant house and rigged it with bolts drilled into wall supports, creating a makeshift jail where they planned to bind captive officers to cross beams for interrogation, police said.

Authorities haven't released video 
evidence, but the report states that Brutsche and Newman recorded videos
about their actions and ideology to post following the planned 
abductions.

Hundreds of hours of conversation were recorded over the course of 30 meetings with the undercover officer, police said.

'We
need to arrest the police and take them to our jail and put them in a 
cell and put them on trial in a people's court,' Brutsche said on July 
9, according to the arrest report.

'If we run into the position that they resist, then we need to kill them.'

During
a tour of gun stores the next day, Brutsche said that what they were 
planning was going to be big, 'and that they would really get a large 
following once they started because of the publicity,' the report said.

Police said that when Brutsche was arrested, he denied that police had authority to hold him.

Plot: The pair had were arrested near the Vegas strip after planning to rig a vacant house with a makeshift jail

Police identified Brutsche as a six-time convicted felon and child sex offender from California. Authorities did not detail a further criminal background for Newman.

In Louisiana last year, police linked a sovereign citizen group to shootout that left two deputies dead and two others wounded. At least some of the seven people arrested were identified as sovereign citizen members.

In Arkansas in 2010, a father and son identified as members of the group shot and killed two police officers before being killed by authorities in a separate shootout.

‘This is a serious concern, especially when it comes to law enforcement,’ said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.

She said seven police officers had been killed in the past 10 years during traffic stop confrontations with sovereign citizen adherents, including a sheriff's deputy and constable killed in 2003 in Abbeyville, South Carolina, and a California Highway Patrol officer slain in Alamo last September.

‘The basic argument is the federal government has no power over them,’ Beirich said. ‘It becomes, at the end of the day, "We hate the government and the government has no right to tell us what to do."'
