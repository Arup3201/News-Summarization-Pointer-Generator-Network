Apology: Matthew Freud, pictured with his wife Elisabeth who is the daughter of Rupert Murdoch, said he was sorry for any disturbance caused to his neighbours

Furious neighbours are urging Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth and her husband Matthew Freud to keep the noise down after a spate of raucous celebrity parties at their London home.

Police were called to the most recent bash at the £24million property in fashionable Primrose Hill, attended by Russell Brand, Jemima Khan, Justin Timberlake, Samuel L Jackson and Piers Morgan.

Neighbours claim that since media executive Miss Murdoch, 45, and PR guru Mr Freud, 50, moved into the six-bedroom mansion in 2011 parties have been held three to four times a year, turning a quiet area into ‘little Beverly Hills’.

Parties have been known to go on until as late as 4am on weekdays with music booming from speakers around a rooftop garden and pool, the residents claimed.

One woman said: ‘People living nearby have to get up for work in the morning or to take their children to school. But at the last event they were partying around the pool and in the garden, where loud music was playing, and staff were serving food outside into the early hours.

‘You couldn’t get access to the house to complain because they had bouncers on the door.

‘It used to be a quiet area but it’s become like little Beverly Hills. They should at the very least let the neighbours know when the parties are going to be held and agree a finishing time.’

At the most recent party, held after the GQ Awards in September, dozens of cars took celebrities to and from the address.

Another resident said: ‘There were something like 30 chauffeur-driven cars coming and going up until 1am. Many of the guests were drunk and making a right old racket.’

Police received complaints from around half a dozen residents but no arrests were made.

A neighbour said: ‘It used to be a lovely and quiet area of families and old people. The noise from the parties is very intrusive – speakers are right behind our homes. You can feel the beat from the music and there is always the token screaming woman.’

Another neighbour, a pensioner, said: 
‘On the night of the last party the police said the noise was a matter 
for the council and there was nothing they could do. But the council 
said it would be very difficult to take action unless officers arrived 
when the party was at full blast.’

Lazarro Pietragnoli, deputy mayor at Camden Council,  lives on the street behind the property. He said: ‘There’s very little we can do as a council because the parties are so sporadic.

‘It would be nice for Elisabeth and Matthew to keep their neighbours informed and take people’s concerns into account.’

The Metropolitan Police confirmed officers had been called to the couple’s GQ Awards party at 2am following a complaint.

One of the couple’s staff said yesterday: ‘There was no intention to cause problems at the GQ party. I think one of the speakers in the garden overlooking the neighbouring homes had been left on late by accident.’

Mr Freud said: ‘We are genuinely sorry to hear that some of our neighbours were disturbed by guests leaving our family home on a couple of occasions earlier this year. We love Primrose Hill and would never wish to inconvenience any of our fellow residents.

‘We have a young family ourselves and these were irregular events. Our apologies go to anyone who was disturbed on those evenings.'
