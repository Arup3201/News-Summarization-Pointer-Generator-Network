A growing numbers of teenagers in search of Internet fame are risking their lives by performing dangerous stunts in the New York City subway in what has become an alarming online trend.

YouTube is filled with clips of mostly men in their teens and early 20s jumping across the tracks, playing chicken with trains or 'surfing' on moving trains.

The growing number of recordings and images posted online showing the underground acts of daring has left New York City officials calling for a crackdown on thrill-seekers.

Leap of faith: One of the most popular feats among teenage daredevils is jumping across the subway tracks

Call for action: Manhattan Borough President Stringer has called on the MTA to crack down on people bent on putting their lives at risk and threatening the safety of others

'This game should be an embarrassment to New Yorkers. I don’t think we should let it go. I think we should prosecute people who do this because they are putting other people in harm’s way,' Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer told CBS 2.

Stringer said he wants the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to take steps to prevent teens from risking their lives and the lives of straphangers.

In a statement, the transportation agency overseeing the sprawling New York City subway system has called the stunts 'exceedingly stupid' and 'extremely dangerous,' urging the public: 'Don’t do it.'

There were 55 subway-related deaths in New York City last year and more than a dozen so far this year.

One of those who perished underground was Liam Armstrong, who was struck and killed by a No. 2 train in March as he tried to run across the tracks as a dare on his 18th birthday.

Liam and two friends had mistakenly boarded a northbound No. 1 train while trying to get to Greenwich Village and got off at 79th Street when they realized their mistake.

But instead of crossing to the southbound side above ground, they dared each other to run across the tracks.

One friend successfully reached the other side and another had yet to cross when Liam was struck as the train barreled into the station. As a result, the teen’s leg was severed and he succumbed to severe head injuries.

Even those instances of risky subway feats that do not end in tragedy are still disturbing to watch.

In a video that went viral since hitting YouTube in October 2011, a grinning young man in a baseball cap worn backwards could be seen 'surfing' on a moving train by holding onto a door from the outside of the car.

But
 one of the most daring - and arguably foolish - stunts was performed 
this past January by a daredevil named 'Koki,' who managed to leap over 
the tracks at the 145th St Station on his skateboard. 

Popular: Liam, a student at Smithtown HS East on Long Island, was at 79th and Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side when he was hit by a No. 2 express train at 6.30pm

The dangerous trick - known as an 'ollie'  -  was made famous after a photograph of 'Koki' soaring over the tracks and landing on a platform appeared in 43Magazine.

Photographer Jacob Ireland also got a chance to capture 'Koki' performing his daring skateboard stunt.

Amid the on-going proliferation of subway stunt videos, the Manhattan borough president asked the MTA to consider installing platform edge doors and track intrusion detectors to ward off thrill seekers.
