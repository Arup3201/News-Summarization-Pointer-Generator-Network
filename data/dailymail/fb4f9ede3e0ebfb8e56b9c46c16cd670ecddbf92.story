Bijan Ebrahimi, who was burned to death by two vigilantes who mistook him for a paedophile, could have been better protected by police, said a chief constable

An innocent man who was murdered after being wrongly labelled a paedophile was failed by police, the force involved has admitted.

The family of Bijan Ebrahimi have now called for Avon and Somerset Police to face justice over the 44-year-old’s death.

Mr Ebrahimi was viciously beaten and then burned to death by vigilantes said to be acting on false rumours which had been started on his estate.

The rumours led to police arresting him in front of a crowd of around 20 neighbours chanting ‘Paedo, paedo’. But they released him without charge and sent him home. Mr Ebrahimi was brutally killed two days later.

Six police officers involved in the case have all been served notices of gross misconduct, including an inspector, sergeant and PC involved in his detention.

Yesterday Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan said: ‘We need to ask, “Why wasn’t that poor man better served by us?”

‘Once all the dust has settled and all the investigations are complete it’s important for all the agencies involved to sit down together and try to understand how we failed that man.’

The force is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

In a statement released through their solicitor, the family of Mr Ebrahimi – who was registered disabled and unable to work – said: ‘It should not be forgotten that Bijan had been the victim of hate crimes for a number of years before his death, both due to his race and his physical disability.

‘It was for this reason that the police should have taken especially seriously his calls for help in the days before he was murdered.’

The keen gardener from Iran was reported as a paedophile after he was seen taking photos of local youths vandalising his hanging baskets and potted plants, in order to pass the evidence on to the police.

After he was arrested in front of the chanting crowd, officers quickly realised this was entirely false, and took him back to the estate in Bristol where he lived.

Two days later Mr Ebrahimi was beaten unconscious and dragged into the street where his body was doused in white spirit and set on fire.

Lee James, 24, has admitted murder, while Stephen Norley, 24, has denied murder but admitted assisting his co-accused.

Both men, who the court heard had chosen to ‘take the law into their own hands’, will be sentenced next month.

The family of Mr Ebrahimi said police could have done more to prevent ‘a callous act of unimaginable hatred’.

They added: ‘We hope that not only James and Norley will face justice but also all of those who failed to protect Bijan, including the police.

‘We are anxiously awaiting information from the Independent Police Complaints Commission regarding Bijan’s calls for help during the last days of his life.

‘Every day we have to wait for this information makes our lives harder.’

Avon and Somerset’s Police and Crime Commissioner  Sue Mountstevens added: ‘I think it was a terrible, tragic case which is now being investigated.

‘There are many questions that need to be answered, not only of the police but also of the local authorities as well.’

A spokesman for the force said earlier this week: ‘We can categorically state he had not taken any indecent images and that nothing of concern had been found on his computer.’
