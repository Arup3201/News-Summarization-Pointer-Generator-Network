Posing against the backdrop of a cardboard 'Eden', with only a sign protecting his modesty, this is the male model accused of throttling his Thai girlfriend after he allegedly saw her having sex with another man at a swingers party.

Pictured in 2006, modelling with another woman for animal rights group Peta, Patrick Ribbsaeter holds a sign promoting the organisation's campaign to encourage the closure of all zoos.

The photograph was taken at a studio in Bangkok, where he posed with fellow model Avi Sewa, and was used in an advertising campaign which ran throughout the Philippines, India, Sweden and Thailand.

Ribbsaeter is on trial this week accused of beating up his Thai girlfriend after he allegedly found her with another man at a champagne-fuelled swingers party.

He is accused of punching Wachiraporn Sara-Pod so many times on their drive 
home that she could barely see out of her swollen face, the Old Bailey 
was told.

She eventually fled his alleged assault wearing nothing but a fur coat, the court heard.

The couple had earlier gone to the ‘Killing Kittens’ sex party at a restaurant in Leicester Square, London.

Tickets for the event in October cost £150 a person, and complimentary champagne flowed freely.

Within a few hours of the party beginning, the court was told, couples were openly having sex.

But
instead of being happy to share his lover with others, Ribbsaeter 
allegedly flew into a jealous rage when he caught her in the toilet with
a fellow party-goer.

Miss Sara-Pod, 29, insisted she was only taking drugs with a male friend when her 32-year-old boyfriend burst in.

‘I was feeling tipsy. I remember I took two lines of cocaine,’ she said.

‘Patrick came in and said I had slept with a guy in the toilet. He was really angry. He grabbed me and took me out.’ 

Ribbsaeter then left her and went to another West End nightspot, the British Luxury Club.

She
followed him there, but he refused to talk to her, she said, and he 
left with his friend Dheeraj Harjani, a company director.

Finally
at 6.30am he agreed to meet her by her Land Rover Discovery in a car 
park. When she arrived he struck her across the face, knocking her to 
the ground, the jury was told – and struck her again while she was 
sitting on the floor.

A 
passer-by saw the alleged attack and asked: ‘Why are you hitting the 
girl?’ before punching Ribbsaeter in the face, the court heard, in turn 
knocking him to the ground.

But
the Miss Sara-Pod then intervened to protect Ribbsaeter, saying: 
‘Please don’t hurt him, he’s my boyfriend,’ jurors were told.

Ribbsaeter
then drove her towards his home in Streatham, south London, while 
constantly asking if she had sex with the man in the toilet, it was 
claimed.

Miss Sara-Pod said:
‘Patrick hit me again and again. He was asking me “Did you have sex 
with that guy?” I say no and when I say no he hit me.

‘He tell me I’m lying. He said he will hit me until I say the truth.

‘Then
he grabbed my hair and hit my head on the console. He kept hitting me 
so many times that I tried to open the car to jump out.’

Ribbsaeter eventually stopped the car on their way home, and asked her if she wanted to have sex on the back seat, she claimed.

‘I
said yes because I believed it would calm him down,’ said Miss 
Sara-Pod. But after the sex he punched her in the face and put his hands
around her throat, she claimed.

‘He had his whole body on top of me and kept punching on my face many times,’ she went on. ‘I was bleeding.

‘He had his hand round my neck and squeezed it until I felt suffocated.’

The court heard that the assault only stopped when Ribbsaeter noticed she was losing consciousness.

Prosecutor Camilla De Silva told the jury: ‘It ended when she managed to escape from the car wearing nothing but a fur coat.

‘She ran to a garage and a mechanic called 999 at 10.14am.’

Ribbsaeter’s
friend Mr Harjani told the court he had joined him on his search for 
Miss Sara-Pod at the sex party – and looked on as the accused man pushed
open a lavatory cubicle.

Mr
Harjani said: ‘She was there kind of slumped on the toilet seat and the
floor – and there was another guy there having sex with her or 
something. He was half naked.’

Mr
Harjani said Ribbsaeter later told him the man had tried to rape her, 
and added: ‘Patrick said to me it was OK for her to have sex with 
another guy if she had her senses, because that’s the fun of the party, 
however,  not if she was being taken advantage of.’

Ribbsaeter denies causing grievous bodily harm. The case continues.

The controversial and outspoken founder of Killing Kittens is one of the leading figures on London's swinging scene.

She even describes herself as 'one of the world's leading sextrepreneurs'.

Which makes her connection to the Royal Family all the more intriguing.

When
she's not hosting sex parties and expanding her adult empire, Emma 
Sayle is also the head of The Sisterhood, an all-female charity group 
which Kate Middleton joined in 2007.

The
future Queen was even due to take part in a planned cross-Channel 
rowing attempt with the group in 2007, until she was forced to withdraw 
because of security concerns.

The pair were photographed together on training sessions on the Thames.

The crew, without Kate, completed the gruelling 21-mile journey in less than four hours.
