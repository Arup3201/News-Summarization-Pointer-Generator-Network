Being a professional sportsman is a short-lived career. ‘All footballers know that the end is nigh,’ writes The Secret Wag in her mesmerising memoir of the highs and lows of being a top footballer’s wife.

In the light of England’s World Cup disaster, it’s a remarkably prescient reflection.

She reveals that her husband (‘my man’) is an England international nearing the end of his career.

And no doubt while ‘hurting bad’, as England captain Steven Gerrard eloquently described his post-World Cup mood, the Secret Wag’s nameless husband will be drawing consolation from his wife’s rollicking account of her career as a WAG.

More of that later. But first, the question that we’re all dying to ask: how do you get to be a WAG?

‘Many WAGs seem to be in denial about how they got together with their man,’ writes our guide to the secrets of WAGdom (let’s call her SW for short).

‘However, denial is not just a river in Egypt.’

Oh, stop it, do! She’s not just a WAG, but a wag as well.

‘The fact is that most WAGs met their footballing fellas when they were drunk as skunks and hanging around in the VIP areas in a nightclub.’

That, at any rate, is how our girl got lucky. She was 18 and newly arrived at an unnamed university. (Studying what? Classics? Astrophysics? Nail Art? Alas, SW is maddeningly vague on detail). After working hard for her A-levels, she was ‘single and very much ready to mingle’.

A favourite mingling spot was the ‘biggest nightclub in the city where, on a Saturday night, the Premiership footballers could always be found’.

Not that SW was on the lookout for them: ‘I certainly wasn’t a one-night stand kind of girl and was not willing to become a used piece of footballer’s meat.’

‘However, I found myself’ — as you do — ‘at the club for an 18th birthday party. I was dressed in tartan hotpants and a lace backless top with no bra. I teamed my outfit with black pointy stilettos and a black leather bag covered with metal studs.’

Though not otherwise gifted with acute powers of observation, SW can always be relied on when it comes to the minutiae of a saucy get-up. Her fashion notes on the outfits she wears to entice her husband are especially helpful.

‘I’ve worn the classic nurse outfit, maid outfit and naughty-schoolgirl outfit . . . When I dress in my PVC halter-neck teddy-suit lingerie that my husband spontaneously bought me, I play the dominatrix role . . .’

I’m sure we all wish that our own husbands would be as spontaneous.

Meanwhile, back at the nightclub, the tartan hotpants worked their magic. Standing at the bar was a chap wearing ‘a lightweight casual jacket over a T-shirt, dark-blue denim jeans, bright-white trainers and his hair was spiked-up. Every item of his clothing sported a designer label and his look was streets ahead of how most of the chavvy blokes in the club chose to dress.’

Having ascertained that he wasn’t a chav, SW engaged the handsome stranger in conversation. ‘I know we didn’t discuss anything intellectual since he was a footballer and . . . I was trolleyed.

‘We engaged in light pleasantries. Then, to my surprise, he invited me to do a tequila slammer.’

Concluding from his courtly behaviour that she’d picked a good one, SW permitted him to take her to the cinema.

‘I decided on dark-denim flared jeans, high black ankle boots, and a shimmery, sleeveless top. For quirkiness, I completed the ensemble with a black bowler hat.’ He was wearing double denim and ordered ‘a man-mountain of snacks’, but didn’t try to kiss her.

SW was disappointed, but ‘even with food and drink falling out of his mouth, I found him immensely attractive’.

He eventually made a move and, not long afterwards, she found herself wearing a blindfold in a stretch limo, on her way to a restaurant where they feasted on foie gras (‘As an animal lover I resolved that, tasty as it was, I’d not eat it again’). With the steak and creme brulee out of the way, her chap lowered himself to one knee and handed her a little box.

Ever the lady: ‘The voice in my head screamed, “Oh, s***!” ’

And who can blame her. It was a large square diamond set in a thin band of platinum. Every WAG’s dream.

The wedding was a corker, bankrolled by a well-known glossy magazine. Their guests wouldn’t be allowed to take any photographs, and ‘we had to guarantee that we’d have a substantial number of famous faces at our wedding’.

But ‘we knew that we wanted to share our big day with as many people as possible: since the magazine’s readership was several million people worldwide, we figured that was . . . a box ticked’.

They’re all heart, this pair. And never more so than when it comes to good works.

‘With regard to our charity work, WAG should stand for “Worthwhile and Generous”.’

Of course, the perfect life of a WAG is not without its own problems. SW struggles with her weight (‘I have only very recently concluded that fad diets do not work’).

More seriously, she reveals that she has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder, and endured difficulties in becoming pregnant that were compounded by an early miscarriage.

Happily, the safe arrival of a carefully unspecified number of children and a diet of freshly steamed vegetables restored the marital equilibrium to the point at which rumours of infidelity in a tabloid newspaper were calmly dismissed (‘I picked up my dressing-table chair and hurled it at his head’).

'I will not miss the public exposure that WAGdom has brought, not one little bit'

And now, in the painful aftermath of the World Cup defeat, it may be all over.

About time, too, according to SW: ‘I will not miss the public exposure that WAGdom has brought, not one little bit.’

Poor Mr SW may be broken and hurting after England’s recent World Cup humiliation, but he’s got his impressive property portfolio to fall back on, along with an ambition to get into punditry, doubtless inspired by Phil Neville’s unstoppable fluency.

Meanwhile, SW ‘vows to live in the shadows only as long as my husband is basking in the sunshine, and he’s had enough to last him a lifetime. It’ll soon be my time to shine.’  

Watch out, Victoria Beckham. It sounds as though nothing short of world domination will do.
