Horseracing Authority have suffered more embarrassment with the admission four of the 12 starts at Wetherby have been wrong for the past five years. 

The problem, which came to light following the recent bet365 Charlie Hall Chase meeting, comes hard on the heels of the blunder which allowed The Young Master to win last Saturday’s Badger Ales Trophy despite the sevenlength winner being ineligible.

The BHA disqualified The Young Master on Thursday and fined trainer Neil Mulholland £250 under Rule (C) 37 which states it is a trainer’s responsibility that a horse is eligible.

However, the sport’s ruling body have accepted the blame for the accuracy of Wetherby distances which were first called into question by Timeform following racing on November 1.

The north Yorkshire venue was re-measured on Monday and the 3m 1f chase distance, used for the Charlie Hall, was 78 yards short of the minimum 3m 166yds required for a jumps race to be officially classified as three miles about one furlong.

Neil Mulholland was fined £250 after his horse The Young Master was deemed ineligible to compete in the Badger Ales Trophy last Saturday

Among the others to be found incorrect were the 3m 1f hurdle of the West Yorkshire Hurdle, won in style by Cole Harden a fortnight ago, while the 1m 5f bumper course will become 1m 4½f and the 2m 4f hurdle track will change to 2m 4½f.

Trainer Willie Mullins will target the William Hill King George at Kempton on Boxing Day with Champagne Fever after watching the classy grey make all to win the Clonmel Oil Chase.

Mullins said: ‘We will look at the John Durkan next and he could run in the King George. He is entitled to go there. A flat righthanded track will suit and I expect his jumping to improve.’
