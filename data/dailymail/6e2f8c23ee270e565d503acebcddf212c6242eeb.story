The Super Puma helicopter crash that killed four oil workers last Friday was not caused by a fault or technical problem, according to the Civil Aviation Authority.

The regulator's decision to return the Super Puma fleet to service after a temporary suspension on flights comes one week after the incident.

The CAA said it would not have allowed the helicopters to return to the skies unless it was satisfied that it was safe to do so and their decision is 'appropriate'.

A spokesman said: 'It was right that Super Puma operations
were suspended in the immediate aftermath of the accident on August 23 
until further information was available.

'Since the accident, our experts have 
been in close touch with the Air Accident Investigation Branch, the 
helicopter operators, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the Norwegian
regulator and others.

'Based on all the information currently 
available, we do not believe that the accident was caused by an 
airworthiness or technical problem, and consider that the decision by 
the operators to resume Super Puma flights is appropriate.'

The victims were named as Duncan 
Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham; George Allison, 57, from
Winchester, Hampshire; Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Moray; and 
59-year-old Gary McCrossan, from Inverness.

Last Friday’s crash was the fifth incident involving Super Pumas in the North Sea since 2009.

The model is said to make up about half of the UK offshore industry’s 
75-strong helicopter fleet and the freeze caused disruption to the 
movement of workers on and offshore.

Last Friday’s crash was the fifth incident involving Super Pumas in the North Sea since 2009.

The
Super Puma is said to make up about half of the UK offshore industry’s 
75-strong helicopter fleet and the freeze caused disruption to the 
movement of workers on and offshore.

Les Linklater, Step Change In Safety’s 
team leader, said there were almost 16,000 people offshore, with more 
than 12,000 in the areas most affected by the suspension - the central 
and northern North Sea.

'There are over 250 people who have spent more than 21 days offshore. This is increasing daily and they and their families are wondering when they are going to get home,' he said.

'Industry has a duty of care to all offshore workers both in terms of their safety and their well-being; we must consider the cumulative risk of the "time out".'

Tragedy: George Allison, 57, from Winchester, and Sarah Darnley, 45, 
from Elgin, who lost their lives

The Super Puma L2 aircraft went down 
around two miles west of Sumburgh airport on Shetland as it was 
returning to the island from the Borgsten Dolphin platform.

The aircraft was carrying 16 workers and two crew at the time of the incident.

Last year, two helicopters ditched in
the North Sea only six months apart. All passengers and crew were 
rescued in both incidents which were found to be caused by gearbox 
problems.

In October, 17 
passengers and two crew were rescued from life rafts by a passing vessel
after the helicopter, which was carrying an oil crew from Aberdeen to a
rig 86 miles north west of Shetland, was forced to ditch.

Previously, in May 2012 all 14 passengers and crew members on a Super Puma helicopter were rescued after it ditched about 30 miles off the coast of Aberdeen. The helicopter was on a scheduled flight from Aberdeen Airport to a platform in the North Sea at the time.

Super Puma EC 225s were grounded in the wake of the two incidents but were given approval to fly again and services resumed earlier this month.

In April 2009, 16 people died when a Super Puma plunged into the sea. Its gearbox failed while carrying the men to Aberdeen. The Bond-operated aircraft was returning from the BP Miller platform when it went down off the Aberdeenshire coast on April 1, 2009.

The regulator said it would review its position if any new evidence came to light.
