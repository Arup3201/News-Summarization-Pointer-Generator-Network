Cllr Terry Wilkins, left, has been falsely claiming to have an MBE for 19 years

A former policeman who has been falsely claiming to have an MBE for nearly two decades says he has been the victim of a long-running hoax.

Terry Wilkins, 67, now a Conservative councillor for Illogan, Cornwall, even had the prestigious honour listed on the council's website.

The former Metropolitan Police special constable has also admitted to lying on his LinkedIn profile, wrongly claiming to be studying for a degree with the Open University. He told the BBC that this was part of a 'game' aimed at embarrassing an unnamed person.

However, according to fellow Illogan councilor Stephen Richardson - who is now calling for his resignation - Cllr Wilkins has mentioned his degree is official statements during council meetings. Cllr Richardson described it as a 'very funny sort of game'.

Mr Wilkins, who lived in Redruth with his wife Sue, had claimed he was awarded the MBE 19 years ago while working for the police but had not attended the ceremony.

He said the medal was subsequently sent in the post and that he hid it in a draw because it 'embarrassed' him.

Once the truth was uncovered, Mr Wilkins declared he had been the victim of a hoax by a resentful ex-colleague who had 'set out to deceive' him.

He said: 'I was shocked to discover that I have been the victim of an elaborate and malicious hoax over the awarding of the MBE.

'I was informed that I had been awarded an MBE in 1995 while working in the Metropolitan Police Service.

'At the time I had no reason to question the validity of the correspondence and, as my late wife and I decided not to attend the investiture at Buckingham Palace, was subsequently sent a medal in the post.

'At the time I was embarrassed at receiving the honour and put the medal in a drawer along with my long service medal.

'It was not until recently that my present wife suggested that I should acknowledge the honour.

'I spent most of yesterday contacting former colleagues only to discover that my worst fears were true and that an aggrieved ex-colleague had set out to deceive me.

'I don’t know why I did not question the official correspondence that I received at the time: probably because I was overcome with feelings of pride and kudos.

'I asked my ex-colleagues why I wasn’t told the truth either at the time or afterwards and it seems that people and time moving on meant that it was lost in the ether.'

The Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the specific case, but a spokeswoman said: 'We expect all of our officers to behave with a certain level of professionalism at all times.'

Even his profile on the council's webpage listed the prestigious honour after his name

Other local organisatins, including the Rotary Club, believed Cllr Wilkins, left, when he said he had the award

Mr Wilkins was elected to Cornwall Council in 2009 but is now facing calls to step down. However, he has said he has no intention of doing so. The local Conservative Association will be conducting an investigation into the incident.

Councillor Richardson, who is a member of the Mebyon Kernow party, said: 'Mr Wilkins should seriously consider his position. I am 
considering reporting both himself and the Conservative Party to the 
appropriate authority, as I believe this to be electoral fraud.'

He added: 'All that I can say is that I've never wanted to call anyone a liar 
until it is proven they are but if his story is proven true then he is 
either extremely unfortunate or extremely stupid. I've just got the 
impression that there is more to uncover and there could be a whole 
house of cards about to fall down.'

Cllr Wilkins said: 'The fact that this hoax has gone on for 19 years has come as a huge shock to both me and my wife.

'I have not used the honour for personal gain. I would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone whom I may have unwittingly misled in the past.

'I shall be removing all mention of the award on stationery and e-mail addresses immediately.'
