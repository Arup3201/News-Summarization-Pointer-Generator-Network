A jigsaw addict spent 17 months completing one of the world's biggest puzzles.

Amanda Warrington had to painstakingly glue each of the 24,000 pieces to her living room wall as it was the only space in her home big enough to accommodate the 14ft by 5ft puzzle.

The jigsaw called Life: The Great Challenge previously held the record for the biggest commercially available puzzle in the world when it was released in 2007.

Sticking to the task: Amanda Warrington, 50, celebrates with her 24,000 piece jigsaw puzzle that she finally completed after 17 months

Piecing it together: Department of Work and Pensions employee Amanda Warrington worked on the 24,000-piece puzzle in the evenings

The monster puzzle features a range of animal, sea life and planet scenes and when boxed weighs almost two stone.

Ms Warrington, from Bristol, said her friends were shocked at the level of patience she showed in completing the jigsaw.

The 50-year-old, who works for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: 'I love a challenge.

'I must have done at least 50 puzzles before but my favourites are doing the difficult ones like the mosaics, globes or the baked beans puzzle.

'I work full time so I was doing between 30 minutes and an hour each day but I have to admit sometimes I was staying up until 3am because I was getting addicted.

'My friends are amazed and think I'm a little mad as well. They don't understand how I have so much patience.

'It gets to a point where you become excited to get it finished but it's an odd feeling now that it's not there to be done.'

The enormous puzzle, Life: The Great Challenge, which was once crowned the biggest commercial jigsaw in the world, covers an entire wall of her home

The jigsaw weighs almost two stone when it is boxed and was previously the Guinness Book of Records' largest commercially available puzzle

The mammoth puzzle features incredibly detailed scenes of a range of colourful fish, a vast array ofÂ  animals and various boats with bright sails

Ms Warrington's sister bought her the puzzle to feed her addiction to jigsaws.

She said: 'I saw it on the news and my sister bought it for me over the internet two years ago because the family all know what a puzzle addict I am.

'Now that it is finished it totally dominates my front room. When the sun comes through the windows in the morning it has a very calming effect.

'The only other problem is that it is glued to the wall so if I ever do move house I'll have take the wall with me.'

Amanda Warrington said finishing the puzzle became an addiction and she would spend time on the jigsaw after work and would often stay up until 3am working on it

Life: The Great Challenge was officially registered as the world's largest commercial jigsaw puzzle when it was released in 2007. Designed by artist Royce B. McClure, it is made up of a number of his previous paintings put together in one giant puzzle.He said the art in the bottom corner alone took 400 to produce originally.
