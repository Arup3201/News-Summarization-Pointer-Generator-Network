There was a time when a hen do consisted of a good old knees up down the local pub, maybe withe a few naughty, novelty straws thrown in and an L plate to be worn by the bride-to-be.

But now the average cost of attending a hen do has spiralled to hundreds of pounds per guest and fancy parties can involve anything from  a mini stay-cation or even a full-blown holiday, leaving attendees seriously out of pocket.

The average cost of attending a hen do abroad is almost £700 and for those held at home in Britain just short of £200 per person - yet going to the big day itself can cost them a fraction of the price, says a new survey.

Increasingly fancy bachelorette parties can involve a mini staycation or even a full-blown holiday

Respondents cite the rising cost of bachelorette parties  is down to many factors, starting with the need to plash out on a wardrobe update - even if it is just to keep up with appearances.

And looking your best to bid farewell to the bride's single-life can involve more money than ever with sprucing up for the occasion including hair and beauty sessions, while food and drink and transport, all bump up the price to an average of £185 when staying in the UK.

Furthermore, an increasing trend to hold parties abroad can involve a whole new holiday wardrobe complete with bikinis and going-out clothes plus the flights and hotels, sees the average costs rise to £680.

In contrast the average cost of attending a wedding is estimated to be around £360, including everything from a night's accommodation, one new outfit, a wedding present, drinks and transport, according to the survey of 1,100 shoppers.

The stag and hen party industry is worth an estimated £300million a year and growing - with many young professionals treating the events as a mini-holiday that lasts several days rather than just one night.

Over four out of ten (43 per cent) potential brides questioned in the survey said they gave friends at least three months warning of a hen party so they could plan ahead and a quarter (24 per cent) provided more than six months notice of the celebrations.

Two thirds of all women invited to a pre-nuptual knees up said they would start saving well in advance in order to afford the occasion and look to buy suitable outfits often taking advantage of sale.

More than three quarters (78 per cent) said they would buy something new to wear.

A personal stylist at Debenhams, who commissioned the research said: 'We have seen a steady increase in enquiries from customers wanting help purchasing new outfits for hen parties, weekends and trips abroad.

'Often the group of invited women may not all have seen each other for a few years and it is natural that they want to look their best.

'Planning and shopping ahead is the key to getting the most for your money.'

For those in the UK, beauty prep, food and drink and transport, all bump up the price to an average of £185

The term 'hen party' dates back to the 1800s and signified a gathering of women, but there was no link with weddings.

Writer George Monger wrote about the pre-wedding customs prevalent in industry in 1971, with some obvious parallels to the hen party culture we see today.

On a female employees last day of work before the wedding she would be dressed up in a coat or veil to look like a parody of a bride, then paraded around the factory to be congratulated.

However, it was not until 1976 that the Times newspaper first used the phrase 'hen party' in the modern-day sense.

It was in a news report about a male stripper who was fined by Leicester Crown Court for acting in 'a lewd, obscene and disgusting manner'.
