Jermain Defoe featured in the pre-match montage at White Hart Lane and Harry Kane T-shirts were being sold on stalls outside but it was an 88th minute strike by Christian Eriksen, the late goal specialist, that sealed victory for Spurs.

Sunderland’s new signing Defoe was given a warm reception when his name was read out in Gus Poyet’s starting line-up. He is close to being a club legend at Spurs, having scored 143 goals during two spells there, and had been training with the club’s development squad until the paperwork for his move to Wearside was completed late on Friday.

They know the 32-year-old well and did a good job of bringing to an end his record of scoring on his debut for every club.

Eriksen, meanwhile, scored his eighth goal of the season, five of which have come in the last six minutes of the game. Spurs head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is said to demand so much from his players in training that they require ‘two hearts’ said Eriksen’s superior fitness was telling.

Crediting his assistant Jesus Perez, Pochettino said: ‘It’s a lot down to him. We score a lot of late goals and I think that’s because our fitness is very good. Our mentality is that we always believe we can win, you have to be strong in your mind, but you also have to feel good physically then you can push on.’

Eriksen struck two minutes from time with his third goal in as many games against Sunderland after he collected an Andros Townsend ball on the edge of the box before striking low and powerfully past Costel Pantilimon. Sebastian Larsson had earlier cancelled out Jan Vertonghen’s third-minute opener.

‘It’s always a bit of a heartbreaker when the winning goal comes so late,’ said Poyet. ‘It hurts but it is part of football and you need to be good all the time, not just until the 88th minute. But for our new way of playing we did OK.’

Poyet disagreed with referee Chris Foy’s decision to wave away Defoe’s penalty appeal after he went over in the box following a challenge by Vertonghen. ‘If he gets the penalty and scores then we are talking about a great debut, but unfortunately the referee did not see what everyone else saw,’ Poyet said.

All the focus before the match was on prolific goal scorer Defoe but it was Vertonghen, who had not scored in the Premier League since March 2013, who put the home side ahead. Eriksen’s free-kick was parried by Pantilimon and bobbled towards Vertonghen on the edge of the area. The Belgian’s shot deflected off Santiago Vergini and into the net.

Defoe’s most notable contribution was enticing a foul by Vertonghen, earning a free-kick from 20 yards out. Larsson expertly curled the ball into the top corner to even up proceedings on 31 minutes. It was the Swede’s 11th Premier League goal direct from a free-kick and he is in good company — only Thierry Henry, Gianfranco Zola and David Beckham have scored more.

Defoe was not the only man making a comeback. Emmanuel Adebayor was brought on to replace Roberto Soldado, who again failed to capitalise on his chances, after 61 minutes. The Togo striker was making his first appearance for Spurs since a defeat at Stoke on November 9 and was jeered by some fans.

He has not played at White Hart Lane since complaining that booing from supporters was damaging. After the final whistle he disappeared down the tunnel while his team-mates celebrated on the pitch.

Hugo Lloris endeared himself to fans once more with vital saves of creditable Adam Johnson and Danny Graham efforts.

In a last-ditch attempt to equalise, Sunderland’s 6ft 6in keeper Pantilimon rushed to join the visitors’ attack in the dying seconds. Spurs broke on the counter and Vertonghen thought he had given them a third goal, shooting into an open net, but a referee’s assistant raised his flag for offside.

‘I think the referee and linesman were a little bit confused on the rule,’ said Pochettino. ‘It was definitely a goal, he was inside his own half, but maybe they were not focusing on the game.’ Not that the Argentine seemed too upset.
