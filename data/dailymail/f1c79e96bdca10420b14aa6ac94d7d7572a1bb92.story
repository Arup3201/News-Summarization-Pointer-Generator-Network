Riot police and activists clashed on the streets of Spain today as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy  warned that his country could not carry on funding itself for long.

The clashes, in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo, were part of an ongoing protest against the eviction of residents from their homes.

More than one million Spanish people are facing crippling mortgage debt.

The riot police were called in to forcibly evict activists from the ‘Stop Deshaucios’ (Stop Evictions) social movement, who had set up in a building where an Ecuadorian family was facing eviction.

They tried to blockade the building and threw buckets of water from upstairs windows in a bid to prevent the entry of police into the building.

Many of the protesters were arrested and others injured as police tried to fight their way into the building.

Meanwhile, Mr Rajoy revealed his intention to ask other European Union leaders at a summit starting tomorrow to use existing options to stabilise financial markets.

Speaking
in parliament before a meeting of European heads in Brussels tomorrow and Friday, Mr Rajoy warned Spain would not be able continue financing itself 
at current yields for a long time.

Referring to policy options already available such as the European Central Bank's (ECB) bond-buying programme and long-term funding tenders (LTROs), Mr Rajoy said: 'I will propose measures to stabilise financial markets, using the instruments at our disposal right now.

'The
most urgent issue is the one of financing.

'We can't keep funding 
ourselves for a long time at the prices we're currently funding 
ourselves.'

With Spain and the rest of the Eurozone's 'big four', struggling to narrow their differences over how to tackle the bloc's worsening debt crisis, Mr Rajoy said he would fight to secure aid for the country's banks directly and without enhanced creditor status from Europe's rescue funds.

Speaking in parliament ahead of the two-day meeting of European leaders starting on Thursday in Brussels, Mr Rajoy said Spain would not be able continue financing itself at current yields for long.

Twin three-year tenders offered by the ECB in December and February released more than one trillion euros into the financial system and were credited with staving off the worst effects of the debt crisis late last year and early in 2012.

But the ECB has given no indications that it is planning to offer further LTROs or revive the dormant bond-buy programme - instead putting the onus on the region's governments to come up with a concerted response to the crisis.

Mindful of the need to minimise the political stigma associated with a bailout after agreeing to a bank sector rescue worth up to €100 billion (£80 billion), Mr Rajoy said he would keep working for a direct recapitalisation of Spain's debt-scarred lenders with European funds.

That would cut the vicious circle between indebted sovereign borrowers and weak banks.

Mr Rajoy said Spain would continue to press to remove the preferred creditor status of Europe's permanent rescue fund, the ESM, thereby avoiding further increases of the country's debt pile and reassuring other investors they would not drop down the repayments queue.

'I will keep working to obtain a direct recapitalisation of banks and to make sure the European aid doesn’t override the rights of other holders of public debt,' Mr Rajoy said.

On that score, he may win support at the summit from Germany, the EU's biggest economy and paymaster, which appears ready to budge on using the rescue funds more flexibly to help banks and reassure investors spooked by the increased risk of facing writedowns on government bonds.

Spain’s banks were crippled by a 2008 property crash.

The Spanish government is under intense pressure from nervous debt markets to tame one of the highest funding gaps in the Eurozone and, to garner support within the bloc for its policy preferences, will be keen to show new austerity measures to European leaders at the summit.

Madrid said yesterday it was considering raising consumer, energy and property taxes to control a public deficit that may have already exceeded one of its budgeted ceilings for the full year.

'The most urgent issue is the one of financing. We can’t keep funding ourselves for a long time at the prices we’re currently (paying),' Mr Rajoy said today.

Madrid’s short-term borrowing costs nearly tripled from a month ago at an auction yesterday, while demand shrank as investors continue to seek ever higher premiums to hold Spanish debt.

It was revealed today that Spain’s 10-year debt yields are flat at 6.84 per cent, still uncomfortably close to the seven per cent level that triggered full-scale bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
