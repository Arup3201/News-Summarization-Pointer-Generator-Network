A NBA star has kissed goodbye to $25k for failing to see the funny side of a match day tradition and sticking his middle finger up at the camera for 17,000 spectators to see on the stadium's big screen.

Boston Celtics player Chris Wilcox flipped the bird when he became the focus of kiss cam - which zooms in on couples in the crowd with the aim of getting them to pucker up for the Jumbotron.

The far from romantic gesture came as the camera operator singled out 6ft 4ins Wilcox and his teammate Jared Sullinger.

It has prompted NBA bosses to fine Wilcox $25k but the punishment will hardly dent the 30-year-old's $854,389 salary.

The kiss cam is a fans favourite at NBA arenas across the US but can lead to awkward situations, with relatives sometimes having to plead with the camera crew to move on to their next target.

It is not unusual for players to become kiss cam fodder but they normally shrug it off with a chuckle, get into the spirit with a pretend kiss or just ignore it altogether.

Even Barrack Obama is not immune from kiss cam. Earlier this year he sportingly kissed wife Michelle when they flashed up on the big screen during an exhibition match between USA and Brazil.

Wilcox was targeted in the fourth quarter of the Celtics match against Philadelphia 76ers' at the Wells Fargo Center in Pennsylvania on Friday - which they lost 95-94.

He signed for Celtics in the summer, a year after a $3m deal with the club fell through because Wilcox was diagnosed with heart problems.

Wilcox has played for seven NBA teams, including New York Knicks and Los Angles Clippers, in his 10-year career but his trophy cabinet is empty. He has also struggled to replicate the form he showed during a spell at Seattle SuperSonics from 2005-08.
