Scunthorpe United have confirmed the appointment of Mark Robins as their new manager.

The 44-year-old former Rotherham United, Coventry City and Barnsley boss was presented at a press conference at Glanford Park on Monday lunchtime.

Robins has been out of work since leaving Huddersfield Town just one game into this season and succeeds Russ Wilcox, who was sacked last Wednesday.

Robins, who has signed a three-year deal at Glanford Park, watched on from the stands as Scunthorpe beat 10-man Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium on Saturday. 

He said: 'First and foremost, I'm delighted. I watched the game on Saturday and was very encouraged with what I saw.

'Gillingham is not an easy place to go and we controlled that game.

'To gain a job, someone has to lose a job and Russ did a fantastic job last season and has brought in some great players.

'It's exciting times for the football club. Injuries have caused us problems, so we have to get those players back.

'Every job is a different challenge. But saying that, it's the same challenge, we have to start picking points up.

'There are reasons to be optimistic within the squad but obviously there are areas to be worked on. That will be an ongoing thing.

'There are no panic stations yet. We've got a lot of games left and we will put in a plan to not only get out of this but play exciting football.'
