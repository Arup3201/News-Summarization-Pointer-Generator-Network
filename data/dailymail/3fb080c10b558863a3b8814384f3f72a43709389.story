David Cameron today accused Ed Miliband of 'wanting to live in a Marxist universe' as the two leaders clashed over how to tackle crippling energy bills.

The Prime Minister accused the Labour leader of wanting to impose state control on markets while increasing costs for families with extra green levies.

But Mr Miliband hit back, claiming the Tories could not decide if his policy to freeze bills for two years was 'a good idea or a communist plot'.

Mr Miliband used his speech to last 
month's Labour conference to announce he would promise millions of 
families and businesses that bills will not rise from the 2015 election 
until January 2017.

The 
energy price freeze drew immediate comparisons with the stance taken by 
left-wing Labour governments in the 1970s to make dramatic interventions
 in the way industry is run.

Mr Miliband also promised to scrap the 
energy watchdog Ofgem and use the 20 months to overall the competition 
and transparency rules to smash the dominance of the Big Six energy 
firms.

It will save the average household £120 each and businesses will be £1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills.

Mr
 Cameron initially dismissed the idea as 'nuts' but this week admitted 
the idea of curbing rises had struck a chord with voters.

Chancellor George Osborne claimed the Labour leader had put forward the same argument 'Karl Marx made in Das Kapital'.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Miliband said: 'Is freezing energy prices a good idea or a Communist plot?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'I will leave the Communist plot to him.'

He went on: 'You are committed to a new decarbonisation target that would add £125 to every bill in the country.'

Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed Labour's energy bills freeze as a 'gimmick' and accused Labour party leader Ed Miliband of lurching to the left with state controls on business

The PM accused Mr Miliband of not understanding that national governments are unable to influence global oil and gas prices.

'I
 know you want to live in some sort of Marxist universe where you can 
control these things but you need a basic lesson in economics.'

Mr Cameron said if Mr 
Miliband did introduce the price freeze, it would only lead to higher 
energy costs for households and businesses in the long-term.

'This
 isn't a policy, it's a gimmick and the reason it's a gimmick is that 
you are in favour of a decarbonisation target that would add £125 to 
everybody's bill.

'Now it is obvious why you want to talk about the cost of living, because you do not have an economic policy any more.'

But Mr Miliband hit back, telling the Prime Minister he had no answer to Labour's new policy to freeze energy prices.

The Labour leader said the Government's policy to help consumers switch to the lowest energy tariff would not help 90 per cent of the population, whereas his policy would benefit 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses across the country.

Mr Miliband said: 'What is clear is that you are floundering around and you have no answer to Labour's energy price freeze.

'You didn't even defend your own policy, which won't benefit 90 per cent of the country. You have no idea.

'You say you want to bring energy prices down but can you confirm that energy prices have gone up by £300 since you became Prime Minister?'

But Mr Cameron insisted energy prices doubled under Labour and electricity prices went up by 50 per cent.
