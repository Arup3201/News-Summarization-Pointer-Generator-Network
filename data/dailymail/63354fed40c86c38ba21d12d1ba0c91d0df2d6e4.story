A Beverly Hills police sergeant is suing the city, claiming he faced retaliation after reporting that a detective made inappropriate remarks about Whitney Houston's body at her death scene.

City News Service says Sgt. Brian Weir filed the suit Monday in Los Angeles.

Houston was 48 when she drowned in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel two years ago.

Weir contends that a detective sergeant, Terry Nutall, kneeling by the singer's body removed a sheet and remarked that she was 'still looking good', along with other similar comments.

Weir says that when he reported the alleged remarks, he was harassed, removed from the SWAT and K-9 units and denied promotions.

Police Lt. Lincoln Hoshino says he wasn't aware of the lawsuit but that he considers similar claims Weir made earlier to be baseless.

Houston died on February 11, 2012.

The Los Angeles County Coroner determined that she died of accidental drowning, with cocaine use and heart disease as contributing factors.

Weir’s lawsuit alleges that as the senior patrol sergeant on duty, he 'attempted to secure and preserve the scene of the death' and had placed a sheet over Houston's body to 'prevent contamination' before Nutall arrived and removed it 'to an area below the pubic region', NBC reported.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for pain and suffering and loss of special unit pay.

Nutall has since been promoted to lieutenant.

At the time of her death, Houston was in Los Angeles preparing to attend a pre-Grammy party thrown by her mentor, producer Clive Davis.

The singer’s personal assistant left to pick up items at Neiman Marcus, then returned to the hotel room at 3:36 p.m. and found Houston face down in the bathtub and unresponsive, according to the coroner’s report.
