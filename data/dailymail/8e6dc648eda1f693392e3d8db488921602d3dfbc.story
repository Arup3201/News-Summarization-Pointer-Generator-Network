The former Chelsea, Portsmouth and West Ham manager was unveiled by the Thai Premier League club on Tuesday and vowed to use his experience to turn them into serial winners.

'I come here to help make the team become better,' Grant said.

The Israeli, 59, guided Chelsea to the Champions League final and second place in the Premier League back in 2008, losing out to Manchester United in both competitions.

His last job was with Partizan Belgrade two years ago, whom he guided to a fifth consecutive Serbian SuperLiga title.

Former England manager Eriksson was technical director at the club between September and November 2012.

BEC Tero general manager Robert Procureur said: 'This is a very exciting time for the club to have a legend like Avram Grant working with us.

'Avram will attend our players' training sessions and oversee the players' technical development.

'This is a fantastic opportunity for our players to learn from such a highly-respected coach.'

BEC Tero, whose nickname is the Red Dragons, are currently third in the Thai Premier League table, seven points behind leaders Buriram United.
