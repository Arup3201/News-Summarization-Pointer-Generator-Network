Middle-aged women are the nation's most powerful consumer group but they feel ignored by Britain's high street stores, according to a new report. 

Research has revealed that only one in five mature women feel well catered for on the High Street and 61 per cent actually feel that their age group is 'forgotten'.

They feel ignored by youth-obsessed stores who are  focusing on fashion for younger women.

Women aged 50-plus are the nation's 'most powerful consumer group', but they're 'being ignored'

Sixty-six per cent of women questioned in a survey by fashion retailer JD Williams said they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group. 

The blind spot isn't just in our shops either - almost three out of five mature British women don't feel their age group is well represented in TV or magazines and three quarters feel they are not well represented in advertising.  

The study of 2,000 women aged 50-plus revealed they feel secure about their look, with only 19 per cent struggling to find their style identity.

Almost three quarters rate comfort over style - with a good pair of jeans being their most favoured item of clothing.

While many of these women have a disposable income to spend on clothes, stores have not been wooing them to part with their cash, instead targetting younger customers.

Only 16 per cent of mature women like to be loyal to a particular fashion store - so retailers have to go the extra mile to keep their custom.  

But it seems retailers should be doing more to appeal to this demographic as the over fifties market currently stands as the UK's fastest growing fashion sector. It is now worth £6.7bn and is emerging as Britain's most powerful consumer group. 

A JD Williams spokesperson said: 'There are more women in the 50 plus bracket than ever before and it's abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry. We've made it our mission to address this. Shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you're 16 or 60.'

'Recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector. No longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age, it now marks the midpoint of a woman's life.

'We hope this report heralds a wake-up call to the fashion, retail and media industries to give these women what they want, in the way we do. It's our job to empower; after all ignoring them should be done with peril.'
