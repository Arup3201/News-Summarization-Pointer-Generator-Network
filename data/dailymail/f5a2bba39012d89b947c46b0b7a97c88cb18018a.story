Robbie Williams has been caught out boasting about a bizarre meeting with World Cup star Diego Maradona - only to find he was just a look-alike, it emerged today.

The singer, 38, was tricked by a 49-year-old German into thinking he had bumped into Argentinian's most famous footballer after the pair bumped into each other up a mountain.

Williams then posted a picture online of himself and the impersonator with the message: 'The Hand of God meets God. I wish he was playing this year's Soccer Aid! £Maradona'.

He also posted on his Twitter profile the message: 'How random, just bumped into Maradona on the mountain. RW x.'

But 12 days later it was revealed the man was in fact Germany's most famous Maradona impersonator, who has been making doubles appearances for the last 20 years.

The pair met in the ski resort of Ischgl in the southern Austrian province of Tirol.

Williams had performed at the Top of the Mountain Concert in Ischgl on May 3 at 2,300 metres altitude on a giant open air stage.

Mr Atici, who is well-known in his home country, said: 'I am Maradona's double. I work in a sports shop and come from Bad Dietzenbach, but for the last 20 years I have been making appearances as Diego Maradona.

'I was discovered when I went to a football game between Bayern Munich and Naples in 1989 - the next day there was a picture in the local paper saying that Maradona had been in the stadium.

'When I looked I realised I was that person.'

He added: 'When I was in Ischgl, Robbie was playing a concert. I was waiting to take the ski lift to the top of the mountain. Suddenly Robbie jumped out of a van, gave me a hug and said: "I love you."

'I answered "I love you too!". Robbie then gave me a kiss on the cheek. You know I now can't wash my cheek as all women want a kiss on the same spot he kissed me. I don't just have the hand of God, I now have the cheek of God.

'Robbie really didn't realise I was not the real thing. I was chatting with his wife Ayda who also speaks Turkish. She was really nice.

'Both Robbie's dad and Ayda took their phones and snapped pics of us together. I never thought such a world famous star would fall for my double act. It is sensational. It all happened so quickly. I will never forget that day!'

Williams met the real Maradona in 2006 in a charity football match in aid of Soccer Aid which raised over £6 million for UNICEF. Williams captained the side which beat a World XI 2-1 at Old Trafford.

Both teams fielded seven celebrities and four former footballers, including Diego Maradona for the world side.

Soccer Aid is a biannual British charity event that has raised £12 million in aid of UNICEF UK through ticket sales and donations.

The event is a football match between two teams of celebrities and former professional players, representing England and the Rest of the World.

Soccer Aid was initiated by Robbie Williams together with his friend Jonathan Wilkes.
