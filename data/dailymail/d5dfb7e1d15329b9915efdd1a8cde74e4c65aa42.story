Prince Charles and Prince William show off their language skills today in their first joint video appeal to help combat the illegal wildlife trade.

The Royals decided their plea to save elephants, rhinos and tigers would be reinforced if they spoke directly to overseas nations where poachers kill endangered species for profit.

So in the video, Prince Charles is heard for the first time speaking in Mandarin before using his Arabic and Spanish. Then his son speaks in Swahili and, more hesitantly, in novice Vietnamese.

Language skills: Prince Charles speaks in Mandarin before using his Arabic and Spanish. Then his son speaks in Swahili and in novice Vietnamese.

Their video message is released today before the Royals address 50 world leaders at the Illegal Wildlife conference in London on Thursday.

On the film, William calls for people to use social networking sites to condemn wildlife poaching and to help eliminate demand for ivory, rhino horn and tiger skins. 

Anti-blood-sports groups have, however, criticised the Prince for spending this weekend boar hunting with Prince Harry and friends on an exclusive estate in Cordoba, Spain, owned by William’s godfather, the Duke of Westminster.

A spokesman for William declined  to comment on the ‘private’ visit, but  said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge has  for many years been a passionate advocate for endangered wildlife and  has campaigned tirelessly to help stop  the illegal poaching of rhino horn and elephant tusk.'
