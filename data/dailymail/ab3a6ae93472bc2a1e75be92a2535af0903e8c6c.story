Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal couldn't have stopped for a coffee in a more ideal location on Thursday.

The Dutchman was sitting right underneath Costa Coffee's 'We Make It Better' slogan, something he'll be aiming to achieve at Old Trafford this season.

Robin van Persie was also spotted in Alderley Edge, a popular location for United stars in Cheshire, though the pair didn't meet.

Van Persie has yet to rejoin training at Carrington after a strenuous World Cup campaign, and was spotted here with wife Bouzra and two friends.

The striker was possibly celebrating his 31st birthday, which he thanked his Twitter followers for earlier this week.

Van Gaal, though he looked relaxed on Thursday, will be hoping to make some new signings before the Premier League opener next weekend.

One man United are looking to bring in is Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen, with Arsene Wenger confirming they are one of many clubs who have made a bid. 

Text message? Thomas Vermaelen is expected to be on his way this summer
