Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has spoken of his pride after being handed the captain's armband by new manager Louis van Gaal.

Cleverley, who has graduated through the United academy, wore the armband for the first time in his side's 3-2 victory over Roma in Denver.

When speaking to MUTV afterwards, he said: 'It was fantastic, a really proud moment. I've been here since I was 11. Now, whatever I go on to do, I can say i captained Manchester United. At 24 years old, it's not bad.'

New era: Cleverley will be hoping to land a first-team spot at United under new boss Louis van Gaal

Van Gaal is yet to decide his new permanent captain at Old Trafford following the departures of Nemanja Vidic and vice-captains Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand this summer, while Ryan Giggs is now a member of the backroom staff.

It is understood that Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick remain the leading candidates for the role, while Darren Fletcher was handed the captaincy for Van Gaal's first match in charge against LA Galaxy.

Rooney did his chances no harm on Saturday evening, scoring twice, including one thirty yard scorcher and also producing a magnificent assist for Juan Mata's goal in an impressive first-half showing.

'He and Juan were fantastic,' added Cleverley. 'We are lucky to have players of that quality. It was their brilliant magic that put us in control.'

United headed into the break in cruise control three goals up, but after nine half-time changes their performance became more fragmented, with Van Gaal's side conceding twice in the second period.

'We are disappointed to concede two goals,' admitted Cleverley. 'We should see the game out better but we are still learning and progressing.

'It is obviously good game preparation for us in tough conditions, the pitch was quite sticky and it was warm at altitude against very tough opposition. Roma came 2nd in Serie A last year.

'At times you struggled to fill your lungs and catch your breath but it is good for our fitness.'
