Roy Hodgson has rejected claims Wayne Rooney was about to be withdrawn just seconds before he scored the goal that saved England against Estonia in Tallinn.

The visiting bench were debating substitutions as the 73rd-minute free kick was being prepared, and Rooney’s No 10 appeared briefly on the fourth official’s board before the England captain stepped up to score the winning goal.

Rickie Lambert was preparing to come on and the England manager claimed later that it was a straight choice between Rooney and Danny Welbeck, both of whom had missed chances, and that the final decision had not been made.

Rickie Lambert prepares to come on for England as Roy Hodgson seeks to break the deadlock

But just as the Liverpool is about to come on, Wayne Rooney scores a free-kick, and Lambert is sent back

Shortly after the goal, Welbeck rolled his ankle and was replaced by Lambert on 80 minutes before heading into the dressing room for treatment.

Hodgson said: ‘We wanted to get Rickie on because he’s a goalscorer and we hadn’t been taking our goal chances so when you have someone like Rickie, who you know has a goal in him, we wanted him on the field.

‘So it was really was a question of which one we take off, as they had both missed their chances. Neither of the strikers could have been too critical of me if I had chosen him. 

'We were umming and aahing about which of the two front players to take off and when Danny turned his ankle, there was of course no question.'

When being interviewed by ITV, Hodgson was then told that their touchline reporters had seen the paperwork indicating that Rooney’s number, No 10, was the player to come off but the manager claimed he had no knowledge of that. 

‘We were still considering it, as far as I know,’ said Hodgson. 

‘To be fair, as I was in discussion, I don't know about forms going in so no doubt you're going to produce some evidence but certainly it wasn't my intention.’

Rooney, who moved to one behind Jimmy Greaves on the England all-time scorers list with his 43rd goal for his country, looked surprised when told that he was about to come off before the free-kick.

‘That's football,’ he said. ‘I think I've shown over the years I'm always capable of scoring goals.’

Rooney might have had a hat-trick, missing excellent chances on 18 minutes and just before full-time when clean through on goal but said: ‘We knew before the game, having obviously faced teams like this before, that they're tough games. 

'It's difficult to break them down, and tonight it was. Thankfully, we got the goal and saw them out. It was a tough game and a good win. It was close but I was just focussing on trying to get it up and over the wall as quick as I could.’

Hodgson claimed the missed chances meant that Rooney would be content with his overall performance.

‘Wayne is very self-critical,’ said Hodgson. ‘He is delighted of course, to score the winning goal but he knows he and his fellow forwards could have had so many more. 

'We knew it wouldn’t be a piece of cake to come here and win the game. I perhaps didn’t expect us to dominate it as much as we did from the offset. It was harder than should have been because created so many opportunities in the first half particularly.’

Welbeck received treatment on Sunday night on his ankle but there was more hopeful news for Arsene Wenger, whose injury list at Arsenal is growing, when Hodgson said: 'I don’t think he’s injured. I think he just rolled it slightly but the doctors are not concerned about it all.'

ITV: Can you just explain, you might have got a break tonight, because you'd put in (a request) for Wayne Rooney to come off?

RH: 'No no no. We were going to put Rickie Lambert on and we were discussing which player to take off. 

'We hadn't made up our mind if it was going to be Wayne Rooney or, more likely, Danny Welbeck and it had to be Danny in the end because unfortunately he turned his ankle slightly but it's no danger because he'll be fit (for Arsenal).

'I think he'd have been bitterly disappointed if he'd come off the field without scoring a goal tonight and I think he'd have blamed himself. Luckily he doesn't have to because he's scored the winner and we go away with three more points.'

ITV: So that form hadn't gone in with Wayne Rooney's name on it? You were still considering it?

RH: 'No no. We were still considering it. That's right. At least as far as I know.

'I was in discussions with other members of my staff, I don't know about forms going in. 

'No doubt you're going to produce some evidence that a form had gone in in a minute but certainly it wasn't my intention.'

Glenn Hoddle: 'I think Rooney looked like the only one who was going to score. We made that game far more difficult than it should have been.

'We got away with it a little bit at 10 men. That's what happens in football. You get away with it sometimes.' 

Lee Dixon: 'It was a bit surprising. If you're going to bring Rickie Lambert on you'd of thought Danny Welbeck who was quiet tonight, you could have taken him off. 

'He (Rooney) was definitely surprised tonight when he got asked the question (about being substituted).'
