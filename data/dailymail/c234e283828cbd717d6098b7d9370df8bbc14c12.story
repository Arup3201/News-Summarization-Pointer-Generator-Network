Paedophile Rolf Harris has started sketching cartoons for fellow inmates in an attempt to win them over after he was handed a cushy prison gardening job, it has been claimed.

The 84-year-old is reportedly handing out signed drawings to convicts  who  queue outside his cell at Bullingdon Prison, Oxfordshire in the hope of securing one of his sketches.

One prisoner has claimed the entertainer turned down offers of cash for his drawings, according to The Sun while other inmates have dubbed the drawing sessions 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' in reference to his 1990s television programme.

Instead he is offering them free to calm the anger of those who say he was given a 'plum job' of tending to the prison's vegetable patch and grounds.

A source told the newspaper: 'Harris has been overwhelmed by requests. He did four or five sketches within two weeks of arriving and now everyone wants one.

'The pictures are just ten-minute cartoon sketches but the inmates love them.'

It is understood that inmates even describe his drawing sessions as 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' - a reference to his 1990s television hit Rolf's Cartoon Club.

The entertainer settles down to draw between 4.30pm and 6.30pm while prisoners are allowed to walk between cells, The Sun reports.

A Prison Service spokeswoman said that it did not comment on individuals.

Earlier reports suggested that Harris had angered fellow inmates after being handed a job as prison gardener.

Some considered that he may have 'jumped the queue' to land the popular task. 

The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court.

The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court.

He was jailed for five years and nine months for his decades preying on victims including Wendy Wild, Australian Tonya Lee and another girl who was in her early teens, and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years.

Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault.

He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction.

His multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.
