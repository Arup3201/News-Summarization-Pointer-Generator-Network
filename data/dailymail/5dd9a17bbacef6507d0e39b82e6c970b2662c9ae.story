Seventy 
years ago, Jim 'Pee Wee' Martin of the legendary 101st Airborne Division
 parachuted into France, behind enemy lines, hours before the D-Day 
armada launched across the English Channel.

Today,
 at the age of 93, the Ohio World War Two hero jumped out of a plane 
again to mark the anniversary of the June 6, 1944, landings as a mark of
 respect to his comrades of the Greatest Generation who could not be 
there.

This time however, despite the veterans advanced age, the jump was a whole lot easier.

'It didn't compare,' said Martin to CNN, 'because there wasn't anybody shooting at me today.'

Martin
 made his jump as ceremonies to commemorate the 70th anniversary of 
D-Day draw thousands of visitors to the cemeteries, beaches and 
stone-walled villages of Normandy this week.

World
 leaders and dignitaries including President Barack Obama and Queen 
Elizabeth II will have gathered to honor the more than 150,000 American,
 British, Canadian and other Allied D-Day veterans who risked and gave 
their lives to defeat Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.

For his part to mark his successful landing after his tandem jump, Martin said he felt 'asolutely wonderful'.

He revealed he was jumping now because he may be the last man from his unit of the 101st Airborne Division to ever do it again.

Release: Hundreds of American paratroopers drop into Normandy, France on or near D-Day, June 6, 1944. Their landing, part of an all-out Allied assault from air and sea, was the beginning of a sweep through Europe that would finally defeat Nazi Germany

Martin
 recalled that on the first night as Allied troops parachuted in for the
 D-Day invasion, local people thanked them for coming even as their 
houses were burning, and he has since received a warm reception in 
France.

'Some people will come up to you and cry
 and say, 'I was a little girl back then and I remember what happened, 
and you gave us our freedom,'" Martin said.

He
 also recalled the terror he felt as he sat in his Dakota aircraft 
preparing to be parachuted into the drop zone behind the beaches of Utah
 - where thousands of Americans lost their lives on D-Day.

'Everybody
 was scared all the time, and if they tell you anything differently they
 are full of crap,' the former paratrooper recalled to CNN.

'But you just do what you had to do regardless of it. That's the difference.'

Martin,
 who was a private in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was among 
the first Americans in combat in Europe. After Normandy, where his unit 
fought to capture key bridges, he parachuted into Holland in 'Operation 
Market Garden' and fought at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.

As
 a defense industry worker, he had a deferment from military service, 
but Martin said he saw that France and Britain could not win the war in 
Europe on their own and that men with families were joining the service 
and being drafted. He enlisted at age 21 and was later awarded a Purple 
Heart and a Bronze Star.

'The one thing I want to emphasize is that we were not heroes. A hero is someone not expected to do something,' he said.  He told CNN, 'We just did what we trained to do.'

'When you volunteer, and you get trained for it and get paid for it, you may be brave as hell but you are not a hero.'

Another
 visiting dignitary parachuted into the fields of Normandy today - 
General George S. Patton's granddaughter, Helen Patton.

She is in France to host two concerts for the world leaders in attendance as a way to get young people to remember the battle.

'With
 the Patton concerts, we want to find a new way to commemorate, 
something different than the same old-same old with military drums,' 
said the granddaughter of General George S. Patton.

Remembrance: Helen Patton, the granddaughter of 
general Patton gestures after parachuting in to Picauville, during the 
ceremony in homage to the English and American airborne and pilots as 
part of the commemoration of the 70th D-Day anniversary

Icon: George S. Patton led the Third United 
States Army in an armored drive across Europe following D-Day and 
relieved troops at the pivotal Battle of Bulge - Hitler's last desperate
 throw of the dice to halt the Allied advance into Western Europe

For
 many visitors, the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, with its 
9,387 white marble tombstones on a bluff overlooking the site of the 
battle's bloodiest fighting at Omaha Beach, is the emotional centerpiece
 of pilgrimages to honor the tens of thousands of men killed on D-Day 
and the months of fighting afterward.

D-Day
 veteran Clair Martin, 93, said he's come back to Omaha Beach three 
times in the last 70 years - 'four if you count the time they were 
shooting at me.'

The
 San Diego, California resident landed on D-Day with the 29th Infantry 
Division and said he kept fighting until he reached the Elbe River in 
Germany the following April. 'I praise God I made it and that we've 
never had another World War,' he said.

Ceremonies
 large and small are taking place across Normandy, ahead of an 
international summit on Friday in Ouistreham, a small port that was the 
site of a strategic battle on D-Day. Fireworks lit up the sky Thursday 
night to mark the anniversary.
