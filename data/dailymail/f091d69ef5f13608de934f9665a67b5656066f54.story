Lost photographs that a 15-year-old boy took of a natural and relaxed Marilyn Monroe on an afternoon in New York are being exhibited for the first time.

Peter Mangone donned a suit and tie and used to cut class from Bronx's James Monroe High School in 1955 to go and look for his idol outside her home at the Gladstone Hotel.

Armed with just an eight millimeter movie camera, luckily for him, in Monroe's charismatic laid-back way, she invited him to film her one afternoon as she made her way around Fifth Avenue.

Caught on film: Marilyn Monroe was filmed by Peter Mangone in 1955 as she walked down Fifth Avenue. He thought he had lost the footage for almost fifty years

'The whole day she played with me,' he said in an interview with the Today show in 2006. 'People that have
filmed her said no one captured her like the [15-year-old] kid, because
she wasn’t threatened, she wasn’t afraid. It wasn’t going to be in the 
paper so I got the real girl.

'She noticed and cared - she was absolutely magical'

However, the footage wasn't found until some 47 years later after Mangone was convinced he had thrown it away.

The filmmaker died last month just weeks before his work would be exhibited. It was found in 2002 by Mangone's brother, Louis, who was clearing out their family home. 

The 'real girl': 15-year-old Mangone waited outside Monroe's hotel before she invited him to film her for the afternoon. His intimate photographs are being exhibited in New York

Playful: Monroe entertained her young fan Peter Mangone as he filmed her for the afternoon on New York's Fifth Avenue

'I was always aware of his fascination with Marilyn Monroe and the 
film,' his partner of 33 years Dan Pye told southfloridagaynews.com. 'Every time we visited New 
York City and walked past the hotel he’d say 'if I only hadn’t 
thrown that film away.’'

Three years later and slightly embarrassed by his movie star crush, Mangone had intended to bin the film alongside his old movie magazines.

But somehow the five and a half minutes of footage survived.

He went on to have a celebrity lifestyle of his own as a roller derby star and well-known hairdresser and was delighted on receiving the call that told him his film was intact.

New Yorker: The owner of the Danziger Gallery exhibiting the photographs said Monroe felt at home in Manhattan, where the shots were taken

'To me it was gone. Never to be seen again so it was like wow!,' he told the show.

'Within this ordinary context Monroe has 
never looked more extraordinary, natural, or beautiful. It takes an 
unusual generosity of spirit to enable an encounter like this and that 
warmth glows throughout the film,' a
statement from the Danziger gallery says.

She and Mangone were joined on the 
walk by the fashion designer George Nardiello, who would later sew her 
into a sequined dress she sang Happy Birthday to JFK in, and her friend and business partner Milton 
Greene.

The star was recently divorced from Jo DiMaggio and had just moved to the city.

Unnoticed: The star was not troubled on the streets of New York as she walked around in 1955.

Natural beauty: Monroe wasn't made-up for her afternoon captured by 15-year-old photographer Peter Mangone.

James Danziger, the Gallery Owner said: 'Marilyn loved Manhattan, when she died, 
she was actually a New York City resident and she seems very comfortable
in Manhattan. And I think that the way that she is dressed in these 
pictures, in a very chic kind of black suit with a fur collar makes her 
look much more like a New Yorker than we normally think of Marilyn as 
being.'

The 
gallery's promotional material adds: 'So much of our fascination with Monroe is tied up with her face it 
comes as something of a surprise to see her hourglass figure and how 
chic and New Yorker-y she looks in her fur trimmed black cashmere suit. 

'But it is the way that she drifts in and out of interaction with her 15
year old film-maker fan that is most intriguing.  She blows him a kiss 
with a smile that could light up the Empire State Building. She looks up
at the skyscrapers with a look that is both naïve and perturbed.'

'The exhibition will continue as planned – a fitting tribute to Pete'.

Divorced: Monroe had just separated from Joe DiMaggio and moved into the Gladstone Hotel in Manhattan. It was here Peter Mangone began filming her
