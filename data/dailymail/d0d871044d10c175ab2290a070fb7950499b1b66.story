As a crowd of over 500 swelled in Washington, DC Saturday in protest over last weekend’s George Zimmerman acquittal, some cried for a boycott against Florida.

Comedian and long-time civil rights activist Dick Gregory addressed the crowd and told them to hit Florida where it hurts--in the wallet--by steering clear of Disney World and orange juice aisle. The rally was one of many nationwide over the weekend, where demands for ‘Justice for Trayvon’ came in the form of calls for an end to Florida’s Stand Your Ground self-defense laws and for the prosecution of George Zimmerman on charges he violated Trayvon Martin’s civil rights when he shot and killed the 17-year-old last year.

News of the boycott call came as Senator John McCain (R-AZ) joined President Barack Obama in calling for a review of Stand Your Ground laws across the nation.

Rallying cry: Protestors at a rally in Washington, DC called for an end to Stand-Your-Ground type laws and some suggested ways to hit the state of Florida where it hurts

'Going to see a rat': Famed comedian and civil rights trailblazer Dick Gregory called for a boycott on Florida orange juice and on the state's tourist attractions like Disney World

'I can also see that Stand Your Ground laws may be something that needs to be reviewed by the Florida legislature or any other legislature that has passed such legislation,' McCain told CNN, adding that his home state of Arizona should consider similar action.

McCain stopped short of calling for tougher gun controls though, saying 'I don’t frankly see the connection..

While praising protestors who staged a
 sit-in as an attempt to cajole Florida Governor Rick Scott into meeting
 with them, Gregory told the crowd outside the federal courthouse in 
Washington that musician Stevie Wonder had the right idea when he 
pledged to no longer perform in Florida.

‘How
 many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat,’ Gregory asked with
 trademark humor. ‘But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s 
tomb? Had he not died, you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not 
asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. 
Don’t spend it.’

As some members of the crowd chanted ‘boycott Florida,’ Gregory continued with his characteristic humor, according to Breitbart.com.

‘Some
 of y’all ain’t been to Florida in your life and ain’t going,’ said 
Gregory. ‘And all you got to do is get Florida to come to you. Now what 
do I mean by that? They got oranges that they can’t afford to have you 
not buy because they will rot.’

'Justice 4 Trayvon': Around 500 gathered at the Washington protest on Saturday outside the federal courthouse

‘I said to my grandmother, 'We not 
going to boycott Florida orange juice because Florida orange juice is 
sold under different names. We going to boycott orange juice,’ he said. 
‘And when them orange growers start running in to take that governor and
 he knows he can’t stand his ground with them.’

‘Justice
 for Trayvon’ rallies continued elsewhere, as racial tensions remain 
high—and calls for change remain loud—across the U.S. in the wake of 
Zimmerman’s acquittal.

We 
have the strength to wipe our tears away. Last Saturday we cried. This 
Saturday we march,' came the words of Reverend Al Sharpton as he 
addressed the crowds of a New York City protest Saturday.

Trayvon's
 mother, Sybrina Fulton, also spoke at the New York rally, telling the 
crowd: 'Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours.'

Ms Fulton, her son Jahvaris, and Sharpton joined the rally as it marched to One Police Plaza at 
noon, where they were joined by Jay Z and his wife Beyonce, according to
 the New York Post.

Beyonce
 had shown her support for the case last week, asking for a moment of 
silence at a concert after the not guilty verdict was recorded.

While Trayvon's mother was in New York, the dead teenager's father took part in a Miami rally on Saturday morning, according to NBC News.

Tracy
 Martin told supporters outside Miami's federal courthouse: 'I vowed to 
Trayvon, when he was lying in his casket, that I would use every ounce 
of energy in my body to seek justice for him.'

The Reverend Sharpton and other supporters want the Justice Department to pursue federal civil rights charges against Mr Zimmerman.

He
 told the rally on Saturday: 'They will not say that was the young man 
killed in Sanford. They will say that was the young man who helped 
change the laws in the United States of America.'

Speech: Meanwhile, in Miami, Trayvon's father Tracy Martin told crowds there that he will continue to fight for his son

Rally: Crowds gathered outside the federal courthouse in Miami as part of a nationwide response to the verdict in the George Zimmerman case

Former
 Governor Eliot Spitzer, who attended the New York rally, said: 
'Regardless of how you view the legality of the verdict in isolation, 
justice here was denied. An innocent young man was shot and killed and 
that is a tragedy.'

Attorney General Eric Holder 
announced last week that the department would investigate whether the 
Hispanic neighborhood watch man could be charged under those federal 
civil rights laws, which would require evidence that he harbored racial 
animosity against Trayvon.

Most legal experts said it would be a difficult charge to bring.

Support: People march through Oakland, California, as part of the Justice for Trayvon rally

Debate: The rallies, including this one in Los Angeles, were organized to call for civil liberty charges to be brought against Mr Zimmerman

Campaign: In Austin, Texas, crowds marched while carrying banners

Mr Holder added that the shooting demonstrated the need to re-examine stand-your-ground laws nationwide.

The
 Reverend Jeffrey Johnson told about 200 people in Indianapolis that the
 rally was about making life safer for young black men.

The Rev Johnson said there were still
 endangered by racial profiling, and he compared Mr Zimmerman’s 
acquittal to that of four white officers in the beating of black 
motorist Rodney King in 1992, according to the Boston Globe.

'The
 verdict freed George Zimmerman, but it condemned America more,' the 
pastor who is a member of the board of directors of the National Action 
Network, said.

On Friday 
President Obama said it was still common for black men to ‘'be followed 
in a department store' while shopping or to walk down the street and 
'hear the car doors lock'.

He added that he had experienced both scenarios before he rose to social and political prominence.
