Further grisly details have come out in court at the trial of a Florida mother accused of stabbing and choking her neighbor to death before hacking the victim's body into pieces and cooking them on her stove in a brutal, premeditated murder.

A medical examiner has now revealed that the head and torso of limousine driver James Sheaffer was never found, and that only 56 of his 206 bones were recovered following his slaying in April 2013.

Angela Stoldt, 42, of Deltona, sat motionless this week at her first-degree murder trial as details of the killing were laid out for the jury.

It was also revealed that, after boiling some of the body parts in her kitchen - including a foot, a leg and both arms - Stoldt allegedly had her two teenage children help dump the remains in different spots around Volusia County, telling them she had hit a deer with her car.

The prosecution say Stoldt drugged her neighbor Sheaffer before driving him to Osteen Cemetery in Deltona, stabbing him in both eyes with an ice pick, and choking him with a cord.

Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 

Prosecutors said they will not be seeking the death penalty in Stoldt's case.

In September, Stold's attorney filed a motion claiming self defense under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law, but Judge Randell Rowe III rejected the motion.

Court documents obtained by Daytona News-Journal previously showed Sheaffer, a married father of three, had asked Stoldt to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but the 36-year-old kept overdrawing their joint account.

The limo driver also wanted Stoldt to ask her father for a $4,000 loan. 

On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from his work at Blue Diamond Limousines and drove to her home on Horseshoe Terrace, where the two drank vodka and peach schnapps cocktails.

But according to court filings, the mother of two spiked her neighbor's beverage with a prescription pain medication, which she had stolen from her father knowing that it causes drowsiness, especially when mixed with alcohol. 

Stoldt then allegedly loaded the drugged man into her car and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'.

Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains 

While Stoldt had previously claimed Sheaffer 'came at her and said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children', according to her strand-your-ground, Prosecutor Ryan Will told the jury she had planned to kill Sheaffer all along.

She reached to the backseat for the ice pick and stabbed Sheaffer in the right eye. 

She then grabbed a cord with two handles and used it to strangle Sheaffer by wrapping it tightly around his neck, Will said.

After the man stopped moving, the mother grabbed the ice pick again and drove it through Sheaffer's left eye.

She then wrapped the man's head in Saran Wrap to keep him from bleeding all over the car interior.

The News-Journal reported that Stoldt had bought the plastic, as well as rubber gloves, from Wal-Mart just hours before the killing.

She then drove home, with Sheaffer's corpse propped up in the passenger seat, the ice pick still protruding from his face.

Will said Stoldt then drove to her home and parked in the garage, where she cut up Sheaffer's body using a knife and a saw.

She then moved the body parts one by one into her kitchen. 

Life and death situation: Stoldt's attorney filed a motion claiming that the woman was in fear for her life because Sheaffer was threatening to kill her and her two children

'She took him into the house piece by piece. ... The very same house she shares with her two teenage children and she cooked him in her oven and stove. She started with the oven but when the smoke and smell became unbearable she realized that she might get caught,' Will told the court.

Thats when Stoldt allegedly began boiling some parts on the stove.

Sheaffer's head and torso were not found, testified Dr. Marie Herrmann, the medical examiner for Volusia County.

However a soup pot was recovered that contained  Sheaffer's thigh bone, knee cap and some soft tissue, Hermann testified.

Stoldt dumped other mutilated body parts in trash bags and disposed of them with the help of her teenage son, who was led to believe that they were getting rid of a deer his mother had killed with her car the night before.

To cover up the murder, Miss Stoldt then buried her neighbor's cellphone and driver’s license in different parks, and got rid of the pots and pans used to boil human flesh.

When Stoldt's daughter, who is now 16 years old, asked her about the foul smell lingering in the house, the 42-year-old woman initially lied that a rat had gotten trapped inside the oven.

But she eventually came clean to the girl, telling her that she had drugged and killed James Sheaffer after he threatened to kill her.

However, it was not until three weeks later that Angela Stoldt confessed to the rest of her family, prompting her sister to call 911 on April 21 because she was afraid the distraught, sleep-deprived woman might commit suicide.

In the course of her questioning, Miss Stoldt spoke without hesitation of her attempts to dispose of her neighbor's corpse.

'Thursday is when I was cooking him. Friday is when I was dumping him,' she was quoted as saying.

The woman showed little remorse for her actions, telling police she believed at the time Sheaffer was going to ruin her life.

‘I’m sorry, but I put Jimmie where he belonged, in my opinion at the time,’ she told detectives. 

Ms Stoldt eventually led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover James Sheaffer's remains, but officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts.

Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck 

Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood looking for the missing man before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him.

She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2.

The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer.

The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye.

‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied.

Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there.

A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered.

Ms Stoldt is being held without bail.
