Mention Santa and images of a rotund old man dressed in red, chuckling away, come to mind.

But this isn't necessarily accurate - at least if a set of old photographs dating back to 1922 are anything to go by.

The British Newspaper Archive has released chilling images taken from British local papers, that depict Father Christmas as at best an eerie ghost and at worst a predatory-looking spy.

Here, in a 1948 image, a ghostly Santa, who appears to be wearing a full face balaclava, looms over a group of young children and Nurses at the West Cornwall Hospital, Penzance

In one 1937 image, taken from the bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, St Nick looks very sinister indeed.

Titled 'The letter to Santa Claus' it depicts two children writing by lamplight while, concealed in the shadows, a hooded figures silently observes.

In another 1931 image, also from the Bath Chronicle, it is not only Santa’s scowl, dramatic moustache and pointed hood that evokes a creepy atmosphere. 

The little girl to the far right of the photo looks less 
certain about his arrival than her two younger siblings as she clutches 
her doll and leans away with an face full of fear.

The caption 
reads 'Perhaps he was trying to convince the juvenile sceptics that he 
really and truly exists?'

There is something rather spectral about St. Nick in this chilling image from a 1937 copy of the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette Titled 'The letter to Santa Claus' it depicts two children writing by lamplight while, concealed in the shadows, a hooded figures silently observes

The Dundee Courier included this image of a party in 1922. It shows an eerie figure creeping up behind a group of unsuspecting children at the Black Watch Memorial Home in Broughty Ferry

The images have been released by the British Newspaper Archive, a 
partnership project between the British Library and DC Thomson Family 
History, formally known as brightsolid online publishing.

From November
 2011 to 2021, up to 40 million pages from historical newspapers across 
the UK  Ireland spanning between 1700 and 1950 will be uploaded 
to the website.

A 1924 edition of the Western Morning News shows a Sinister Santa perched on a snow-capped roof, using a listening device to eavesdrop on the praying family below. The caption describes how 'Father Christmas is ascertaining the wishes of children by the latest scientific methods'

Another photograph made available to the public is the 1924 edition of the Western Morning News.

It shows a sinister Santa perched on a snow-capped roof, using a listening device to eavesdrop on the praying family below. The caption describes how 'Father Christmas is ascertaining the wishes of children by the latest scientific methods.'

By 1948 it appears Santa had reached new
 levels of frightfulness. An image from The Cornishman shows a ghostly Santa, who appears to be wearing a 
full face balaclava and is looming over a group of young children and nurses at 
the West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance.

'Santa in Nurseryland' from the Tamworth Herald in 1949, depicts a Santa who may not look scary but certainly gets zero points for effort. He sits in an ill-fitting costume and beard with arms folded and a sullen expression on his face

The Dundee Courier published an image of a party in 1922. It shows an ghostly figure creeping up behind a group of unsuspecting children at the Black Watch Memorial Home in Broughty Ferry.

And while 'Santa in Nurseryland', from the Tamworth Herald in 1949, depicts a Santa who may not look all too scary, he certainly gets zero points for effort. 

He is seen sat in an ill-fitting costume, wearing a beard, a sullen expression on his face and has his arms defensively folded.

In this 1931 image, from the Bath Chronicle, it is not only Santa¿s scowl, dramatic moustache and pointed hood that give this scene a creepy feel. The girl on the far right looks less certain about his arrival than her two younger siblings

Amy Sell, spokesperson for The British Newspaper Archive said: 'We already know that today’s online community enjoys sharing photos of creepy Santas, but our research suggests that this has strong foundations in local newspapers of the past.

'Looking back at social and cultural trends in newspapers shows there are more similarities between the past and present than we expect.

'The British Newspaper Archive website contains over seven million pages of fascinating and diverse content from human disasters and war, to philanthropy, triumph, and even cats dressed as aristocrats.'
