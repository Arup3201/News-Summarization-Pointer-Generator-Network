A couple who had been trying for a baby for almost a decade are celebrating the birth of quadruplet girls following a pregnancy that made medical history.

Doctors were stunned when four babies of the same sex developed after a single embryo was implanted in the pair’s first attempt at IVF.

And after nine years of longing to start a family, proud parents Christine and Justin Clark suddenly have a rather substantial one.

Christine and Justin Clark tried for a baby unsuccessfully for nine years before having quads Darcy, Caroline, Elisha and Alexis after IVF treatment

A single fertilised embryo was implanted - so doctors were stunned when four babies developed, and medics said it was unheard of for four children of the same sex to be born from a single embryo

The babies are now seven weeks old, 
doing well in hospital and likely to be allowed to go home next month, 
when the whirlwind of sleepless nights and feeding will kick in.

Dr Geetha Venkat, Director of the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, told MailOnline that if the babies are all from the same IVF embryo then they will all be identical.

She explained that if they are not identical then some of the babies must have been conceived naturally within a few days of the IVF embryo being implanted.

She believes that the presence of two placentas makes this the more likely explanation.

She said that in 20 years of working with IVF treatment she has never before come across quads being born following the implanting of just one embryo.

She said: 'This is a very interesting case because it is very rare.'

But the Clarks, from Rotherham, are 
simply overjoyed at their luck – with the odds of having quads from one 
embryo estimated at more than two million to one.

The babies had a combined weight of 
just over 10lb when they were born at the Jessop Hospital in Sheffield 
on March 25. Darcy weighed 2lb, followed  by Caroline at 2lb 3oz, Elisha
 at 2lb 14oz and Alexis at 3lb.

Mr Clark, a lorry driver, said: ‘The girls are all doing well. Now we can’t wait to get them home.’

He added that the couple were on the verge of giving up hope of a baby when they decided to try IVF.

Just one embryo was implanted – and Mrs Clark, 36, found out she was pregnant only three weeks later.

An initial scan suggested triplets, 
but a second revealed four babies. Mr Clark, 43, said: ‘It was very 
emotional. We were happy, but worried about the logistics.’

The pregnancy also proved difficult as Mrs Clark, a nurse, suffered from extreme morning sickness.

The babies weighed 10lb in total and were born when Mrs Clark was 30 weeks pregnant

The girls were born at Sheffield's Jessop Hospital, and are now being cared for in the special care baby unit at Rotherham Hospital, close to their parents' home

She was admitted to hospital at 24 
weeks because she was breathless, but doctors kept her stable until 30 
weeks before delivering the four babies by caesarean.

Experts believe the single embryo split into three before one of these split again, resulting in qudruplets.

The couple hope to take all four babies, who were born on March 25, home in June

Adel Shaker of CARE Sheffield, who 
carried out the fertility treatment, said: ‘I have been working in IVF 
for over 20 years and this is the first case I am aware of where a 
single embryo transferred resulted in a quadruplet pregnancy.

‘Previous IVF quadruplets have seen babies from both sexes and were reported after transferring two embryos at least.’

Darcy was first born at 2.46pm weighing 
2lbs, Caroline followed also at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs 3oz, Elisha was 
born at 2.47pm weighing 2lbs 14oz and the last was Alexis, born weighing
 3lbs at 2.48pm.

Mr Clark, 43, said he and his wife 
had been able to take the biggest, Alexis, out of the special unit and 
added: ‘It was the first time either of us had pushed a pram.’

The parents said three weeks after the single embryo was implanted, a pregnancy test confirmed Mrs Clark was pregnant.

The
 36-year-old said: ‘When we found out we were having four babies, I just
 couldn’t believe it. I was speechless and to be honest, I didn’t 
believe it until I saw them for myself.’

Mr
 Clark said: ‘They are the first set of quads to be born from a single 
embryo, which then split into three. One of these three then split into 
two, to make twins.

‘On
 the birth of the children there were two placentas so we’re not sure 
yet if we have two babies and the twins, or triplets and a singleton.

‘Tests will have to be carried out when they are 10 to 12 weeks old to confirm this.’

During the pregnancy, Mrs Clark suffered from extreme morning sickness - known as hyperemesis gravidarum.

She said: ‘When the news came out 
about Kate Middleton, I knew exactly what she was going through. It 
didn’t stop until 27 weeks and it was exhausting.

‘I felt sick all the time, and I was tired and lethargic. I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.’

At
 24 weeks, Mrs Clark was taken into hospital with breathlessness, but 
doctors managed to keep the pregnancy under control until week 30, when 
the girls were born by Caesarean section.
