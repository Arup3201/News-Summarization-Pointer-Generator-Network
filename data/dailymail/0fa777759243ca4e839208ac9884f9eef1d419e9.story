Anyone searching for a little inspiration to lose weight before their wedding should take a look at these leading ladies.

Kat Badley, 29, Vicki Smart, 30 and Lisa Wright, 45, lost a combined 5st between them over just 10 weeks in preparation for their weddings this year.

As part of This Morning's Weight Loss Wedding, the women have overhauled their diet and worked with top nutritionists and personal trainers.

Kat, the youngest of the brides, wanted to transform her size 16 figure into a size 12-14 for her big day.

She lost 2st and is now a size 14, though hopes to lose even more weight over the next six weeks before her wedding in Greece.

Vicki, who weighed 13st 5lbs, lost 1st 2 lbs and went from a size 16 to a 14.

Lisa, the oldest of all three, lost the most amount of weight, slimming down from size 18-20 to size 16.

She lost 2st 2lbs for her nuptials in three weeks time.

This Morning teamed up with nutritionist Kim Pearson who devised a healthy eating plan for the women.

Based on the low glycemic method, it's high in protein and low in carbs and sugar.

The diet was rich in essential fats which are important for weight loss and general health.

Plenty of fresh vegetables, salad and fruit ensured an optimum intake of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fibre.

Processed foods and refined sugar were out, as were fizzy drinks, white bread, rice and pasta and condiments such as tomato sauce.

The women were told to eat three main meals per day at regular intervals, including one palm-sized portion of protein at each meal. They were given options such as cod, haddock, salmon and mackerel, and advised to vary the type of protein at each meal.

Kat was particularly focused on her arms, conscious that her wedding dress was strapless.

And,
 with her wedding taking place six weeks from now in Greece, she wanted 
to look her best not only for the ceremony, but the inevitable bikini 
pictures too.

As well as keeping to the diet she started running and took up boxing.

She said: 'I've really surprised myself through the whole process. It's given me 
a new lease of life.

'I come home and instead of just sitting on the 
sofa I'm meal prepping and doing exercise.

'I think it's made me much 
happier, a lot more confident and really boosted my self-esteem.

'I'm the sort of person I've always wanted to be. It's 
life-changing.'

As well as following the strict diet plan the women upped their exercise, taking up running, boxing, dancing and bootcamp training with trainer James Farmer.

Vicki, a self-confessed chocoholic and mother of two was size 16 
before taking on the Weight Loss Wedding 10-week challenge.

After having two children in less than two years, she wanted to get back to her pre-pregnancy size 12 for her wedding.

She described her reaction to the weight loss as 'ecstatic' and has cut out chocolate entirely.

She said: 'I've learnt that I can achieve things. It's been a real eye-opener and I feel really good about myself.

Lisa, who lost 2st 2lbs, said: 'I've learnt a lot about myself over the past 10 weeks.

'There were days I felt tired and didn't want to do anything but I motivated myself and have proved that I have willpower.

'I am so happy with my weight loss. It's made a difference to my attitude to my wedding. Now I feel so much more confident.'
