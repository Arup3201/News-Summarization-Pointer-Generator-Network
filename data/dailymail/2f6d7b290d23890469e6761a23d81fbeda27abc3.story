The Duchess of Cambridge returned to the day job after a relaxing holiday on the island of Mustique today - and she looked the picture of health this morning as she attended an official engagement in London, her tiny bump highlighted with a flattering wrap dress.

The Duchess, making her first appearance since returning from her break last week - and for the first time at an official engagement with a baby bump - chose a black and white MaxMara Studio dress from the 2011 collection, decided to forgo a coat, despite the chill in the air, and accessorised her look with just her £60 House Of Fraser court shoes and a light tan.

The Duchess, who was reported to be dismayed after photos of her on the beach in a bikini were published in an Australian magazine earlier this month, looked cheerful and relaxed as she chatted to staff at Hope House, a residential centre in Clapham set up to help recovering addicts.

At four and a half months pregnant, she is still remarkably slender apart from her tiny bump - clearly Kate hasn't been eating for two.

Picture of health: The Duchess of Cambridge looked relaxed as she attended an engagement for one of her charities, Action On Addiction, at Hope House in London today, though at times she seemed protective of her bump, clasping her hands in front

Kate chose a graphic print wrap dress - very similar in style to an Issa or Diane von Furstenberg design - a savvy choice during pregnancy.

'A wrap dress is the perfect style to wear as a maternity dress,' a spokesperson from fashion news site fashionfreude.com told MailOnline.

'The silk jersey fabric is cool and comfortable and there are no tight waistbands around the middle, And with slim Kate's bump not likely to grow at the sort of rate that Kim Kardashian's is advancing, there's every likelihood she will be able to keep wearing this sort of dress right up until the end.'

Spotlight: Kate hit the headlines today after Booker prize-winning author Hilary Mantel criticised her for being 'plastic' and 'painfully thin' - but today she looked slender, yes, but healthy and glowing

Blossoming: At four and a half months pregnant - almost halfway through - the Duchess's bump was just beginning to show

Stylish: Kate's simple wrap dress revealed a small bump - and also Kate's tanned legs following the Duchess's luxury break in Mustique with William and the Middletons

Warm-hearted: The Duchess of Cambridge made two youngsters 
happy when she accepted their bouquet of flowers after she visited the 
charity she supports

Demure: Kate made sure she didn't show too much cleavage by using a so-called modesty panel across the V-neck of the wrap dress

'Despite
the frost on the ground, glowing Kate is doing the typical starlet 
trick of turning up to an event without a coat which is surprising 
considering she is pregnant and has just returned from a tropical break.

Aside from the lack of winter wear 
and the just-visible baby bump, she’s sticking to classic Kate style – 
the belted waist, sheer tights and black courts from Episode at House of
Fraser (£60) are all looks we’ve seen several times before.

A long-sleeved wrap dress is a 
sensible wardrobe staple for many working women, just sling it on and 
you’re camera ready in seconds. It's the perfect maternity style as it’s
not fitted and can be let out as your bump grows.

Kate has accessorised hers with a ‘modesty panel’ to keep her cleavage under wraps.

This being the Duchess, she’s showing
off perfect hair and make-up, but interestingly, she appears to have 
already said ‘so-long’ to the fringe she recently had cut.

Bearing in mind Kate has a hairstyling team at her beck and call, this is proof that bangs are seriously high maintenance!'

Kate's glossy hair looked healthier than ever too - thanks no doubt to a good dose of the friendlier pregnancy hormones. 

The unruly fringe that flopped into her face for a few weeks at the end of last year was well on its way to growing out, and the rest looked bouncy and shiny.

Kate spent the morning meeting clients and staff at Hope House, a 23-bed residential treatment centre in South West London that offers an Action on Addiction programme, providing a safe, comfortable place for women to recover from substance dependence and receive support for other compulsive disorders.

Glossy: Kate's chestnut hair was blowdried into tumbling waves - and the heavy fringe she had cut in at the end of 2012 was close to growing out

Bejewelled: Tanned Kate accessorised her outfit with the diamond button pendant, £2,800 by Royal jewellers Asprey, and pearl earrings and her trademark glossy blow dry looked bouncier than ever

'With its discreet purple centre and engraved 
'167' address, the Asprey button is a stylish signature inspired by 
buttons on old English garments,' Asprey say of the piece of jewellery 
worn by Kate today - though whether it was a trick of the light, Kate's 
centre stone looked to be more ruby-toned that the traditional purple

Luxury: Was the necklace, on sale for £2,800, on the Asprey website, a gift from Wills?

Glossy: Kate's hair looked thicker and bouncier than ever

'Kate's hair is undoubtedly benefiting from her upcoming baby joy. Pregnancy usually reduces the normal rate of hair loss, resulting in thicker looking, more lustrous locks.

Combine that with the general improved lifestyle choices when you're pregnant such as less alcohol and general nasties and your hair can look better than ever.

Kate's fringe has probably grown out quicker than it would have sans impending baby, as the rate of hair growth can also increase.

Perfect timing as a lower maintenance mane will be welcomed when she's changing nappies!'
