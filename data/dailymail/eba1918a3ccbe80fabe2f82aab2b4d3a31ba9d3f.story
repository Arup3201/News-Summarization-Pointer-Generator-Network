Louis van Gaal's reign at Manchester United ended in defeat as Swansea City claimed a surprise 2-1 win. Here Sportsmail takes a look at what went wrong for the Dutchman during his first competitive game in charge of the Old Trafford outfit.

United need a plan C 

With Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 system exposed in the first half and United trailing 1-0 at half-time, United reverted to a 4-4-1-1 in the second-half in an attempt to liberate Adnan Januzaj down the flanks and Wayne Rooney up front.

For the first 20 minutes of the second half, the plan appeared to be working as United equalised through Rooney and threatened to build up a head of steam. Swansea's second goal killed the United momentum and Van Gaal's team were unable to recover. 

In attack, it was too ponderous and too hesitant. Paul Scholes said on BT Sport: 'When we blitzed teams in the past, it was all about pace. Today, it's all nicey-nicey and taking too many touches. There isn't enough pace in the team.' Plan A did not work, plan B ran out of steam. Time for plan C - buy some high quality footballers. The philosophy can become irrelevant if the personnel is not up to scratch.

Wrong system: Louis van Gaal may have to go back to the drawing board after Manchester United's defeat

Defensive reinforcements are required

We knew this before the game and it was confirmed once and for all on Saturday lunchtime. 

Admittedly hampered by the absences of Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw, Ashley Young ended up at left-back and he was predictably caught out for the second goal. Aside from the injuries, United desperately require at least one centre-half of elite-standing. 

Tyler Blackett was faultless on his Premier League debut but Phil Jones did not always appear convincing in the defensive three while Chris Smalling was easily beaten by Montero for the second goal. 

United need a world-class centre back that can provide guidance and assurance to those around him. Sporting Lisbon's Marcos Rojo remains a target but they should break the bank for Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund.

Adnan Januzaj remains the star

For much of last season, Adnan Januzaj was the stand-out player for Manchester United and the only one who played without fear as the situation deteriorated under David Moyes. 

The Belgian - a little short of match fitness after returning late to pre-season following the World Cup - began this game on the bench but replaced the injured Jesse Lingard early on. Immediately, Januzaj demonstrated his talent, committing opponents and sprinting down the right flank. 

One piece of footwork to sidestep Jonjo Shelvey was breathtaking. He is the club's most exciting and courageous player and Van Gaal must find a way to fit him in.

 Van Gaal said it will take time

Louis van Gaal admitted this summer that it takes time to transplant his ideas. At Bayern Munich, Van Gaal's side were 7th after 13 matches in his first season, winning only five by the end of November. 

They did, however, go on to win the title. In one season at Barcelona, Van Gaal's team were 10th after 14 games. Again, they went on to win the title. At Ajax, it took three seasons before Van Gaal won his first Eredivisie title. United fans may need to be patient with their new manager.

Van Gaal will give the kids a chance

Perhaps forced upon him due to injuries, Louis van Gaal started this match with six Englishman in the starting line-up and nine in the match-day squad. Nonetheless, we should not forget that players such as Marouane Fellaini, Shinji Kagawa and Nani started on the bench, as Jesse Lingard and Tyler Blackett were handed an opportunity. 

Six of the 10 British players in the squad were homegrown in the United academy. It is now 3,701 consecutive first-team games that Manchester United have had an academy product in the match-day squad. The run stretches back to 1937. With Van Gaal at the helm and Ryan Giggs as assistant manager, that record should be protected.
