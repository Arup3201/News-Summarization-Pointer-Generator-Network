Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson has linked homosexuality to bestiality. 

The 67-year-old reality TV star has come under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine and it's possible his show could now be at risk.

He told the magazine: 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.'

Phil, who claims to be devoutly Christian, then grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes in a paraphrased Bible quote.

He said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.'

Phil, who has been married to his wife Kay since 1966, then got even more explicit, stating: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.'

GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show.

In jeopardy: Phil's comments (pictured here with wife Kay) could put the family's reality TV show in jeopardy

GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe. 

'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans—and Americans—who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples.

On growing up in pre-civil-rights-era Louisiana'I
 never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not 
once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers.
 I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white 
trash. We're going across the field.... They're singing and happy. I 
never heard one of them, one black person, say, "I tell you what: These 
doggone white people" - not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you 
say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was 
singing the blues.'

On why he voted Romney in 2012'If I'm lost at three o'clock in a major metropolitan area...I ask myself: Where would I rather be trying to walk with my wife and children? One of the guys who's running for president is out of Chicago, Illinois, and the other one is from Salt Lake City, Utah. [Editor's note: Romney is from Boston, not Salt Lake City.] Where would I rather be turned around at three o'clock in the morning? I opted for Salt Lake City. I think it would be safer.'On health insurance'Temporary is all you're going to get with any kind of health care, except the health care I'm telling you about. That's eternal health care, and it's free.... I've opted to go with eternal health care instead of blowing money on these insurance schemes.'

'Phil's decision to push vile and 
extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need 
to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT 
people and families.'

While A&E have not yet commented, they released a statement from Robertson in which he addressed the controversy.

'I myself am a product of the Sixties', 
he said. 'I centred my life around sex, drugs and rock and roll until I 
hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Saviour. My mission today is to
 go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the 
Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant
 to be together.

'However, I would never treat anyone 
with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all 
created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would 
all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.'

GQ
 also suggested Robertson’s son Jep endorsed his father’s beliefs, when 
he said: 'We’re not quite as outspoken as my dad, but I’m definitely in 
line. If somebody asks, I tell ’em what the Bible says.'

The
 recovering alcoholic also opened up on his darkest days, including 
fleeing Arkansas in the Seventies after beating up a bar owner and his 
wife, something he has never apologised for despite getting sober and 
finding Jesus. ‘I didn’t dredge anything back up. I just put it behind 
me,’ he said.

'We never, 
ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s
 job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether 
they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, 
you see what I’m saying?'

He
 also insisted the show won’t last longer than five more years, 
explaining:  'Let’s face it. Three, four, five years, we’re out of here.
 You know what I’m saying? It’s a TV show. This thing ain’t gonna last 
forever. No way.'

However, he will never regret signing up for the reality TV show.

'For the sake of the Gospel, it was worth it,’ he said.’ All you have to do is look at any society where there is no Jesus. I’ll give you four: Nazis, no Jesus. Look at their record. Uh, Shintos? They started this thing in Pearl Harbor. Any Jesus among them? None. Communists? None. Islamists? Zero. That’s eighty years of ideologies that have popped up where no Jesus was allowed among those four groups. Just look at the records as far as murder goes among those four groups.'

Sharing his father's views? From comments Jep Robertson made in the GQ article it appears he and his father have similar views on homosexuality

The family are multi-millionaires due
 to the success of Phil’s  Duck Commander Company, which he formed in 
1973 to sell the duck call he invented a year earlier.

He began his business in a dilapidated shed, where he spent quarter of a century making duck calls from Louisiana cedar trees.

And it was their third son Willie Robertson, now CEO of the company, who expanded the family business into the multi-million dollar enterprise featured on the hit A&E show.

Since its initial air date of March 21, 2012, Duck Dynasty has grown in the ratings for A&E, eventually becoming a ratings hit for the cable network.

On Aug. 14, 2013, the fourth season première nabbed 11.8 million viewers, making the show the most-watched nonfiction series telecast in the history of cable television.
