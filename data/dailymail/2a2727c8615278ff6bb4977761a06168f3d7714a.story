It's the story that left the nation heartbroken and in tears. For Sydney teenagers - the Lawrence brothers - it's been the toughest of years.

This Christmas was the first they had to spend without their parents.

Eldest brother Jarrod, who buried his mother on his 19th birthday in March, has taken on the huge responsibility of becoming the caretaker of his younger brothers 17-year-old Blake and 14-year-old Dylan.

The boys lost their father in 2008 and with the recent death of their mother, they were uncertain about their future.

But when their gut-wrenching story first when to air on Nine Network's A Current Affair earlier in the year, it changed their lives.

With the help of more than $1.2 million donated by generous Aussies, the brothers say they're doing okay - despite what they've been through.

The Lawrence brothers lost their father Christopher on February 2, 2008 'in unfortunate circumstances'. Mum Natalie died on March 17 this year after suffering two brain aneurisms.

She was buried four days later, on Jarrod's birthday.

Since then, Jarrod has vowed to look after his little brothers while also juggling his studies.

In a follow up interview with A Current Affair on Thursday night, Jarrod recalled the moment he had to make the harrowing decision to turn off his mother's life support.

'It was four o'clock in the morning on Monday,' he said as he fought back tears.

'I woke them [the brothers] up and sat them on the lounge and said: "Look mum's sick, the doctors don't think that she will get better".' 

But in addition to losing both parents in the space of six years, youngest brother Dylan underwent brain surgery in 2012 to have tumours removed and is still on the mend.

The boys are now in good spirits, trying to get through each day with the support of each other.

'We're alright I'll look after the boys and do the best I can,' Jarrod said.

'Obviously you can't become as happy as we were but we're getting through it. Yeah we're getting as happy as we can.'

With the death of mum and dad, the Lawrence brothers were uncertain about their future

Nine months since their story first aired, the brothers received more than $1.2 million in donations from strangers across the nation

Since burying their mother, the boys also made the tough decision to donate her organs.

'She was a loving, caring person and always wanted to help people out.' Jarrod said.

'We got the letter yesterday saying that her liver just saved someone's life and both of her kidneys saved someone's life as well.'

Nine months since their story first aired, they've received more than $1.2 million in donations from strangers across the nation.

'It's been a massive help,' Jarrod said.

'Just average day to day living. We get a bill and it's not so much of a shock when it comes in.'

The brothers will soon have their mortgage paid off for their Holsworthy home - in Sydney's west - and already have renovations plans underway to make room for the growing boys. 

And the good news doesn't stop there.

After all he's been through, Jarrod has been able to fulfill his mother's dream by being accepted into a teaching degree at university.

'She always told me I'd be a great teacher and that I'll get there - and I'm there now,' he said.

The boys' Queensland grandmother, pensioner Jan Lingard, couldn't be more prouder of her grandchildren.

'They're just the perfect boys,' she told A Current Affair.
