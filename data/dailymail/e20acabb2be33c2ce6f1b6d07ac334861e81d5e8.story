Banned: Serial killer Rose West is said to be 'fuming' after prison bosses banned inmates from using the showers after their gym sessions

Murderer Rose West is said to be 'fuming' after being banned from using the showers in the prison gym.

Bosses at HMP Low Newton, a 336-capacity maximum security jail in Durham, outlawed inmates taking showers following workouts after a string of thefts.

The ban was put in place earlier this year after a number of items of clothing and belongings were pinched while female inmates were washing.

Several prisoners - including West - have complained that the ban leaves them 'feeling filthy' after a sweaty workout and they are demanding the rule is overturned.

West has become an 'avid' gym user in the last year since piling on the pounds while inside.

The 60-year-old, who was jailed for life in 1995 for 10 murders, is a size 20 and is thought to weigh around 15 stone.

The mother-of-eight works as a tea lady for prison wardens, earning Â£16-a-week.

But West - along with other inmates - is fuming that they leave the gym 'feeling filthy' and sweaty and are demanding to have the showers in the gym switched back on.

Fellow inmates Maz Cullerton and Tracey Cutting have both complained about the ban on showers, saying it is 'disgusting'.

The two prisoners, who jointly signed the letter on behalf of the 336 inmates at the prison, wrote: 'We feel the need to write in and express our disgust at the way the gymnasium is being run here.

'The most disgusting fact about the gym is that we women are no longer allowed to use the gym's shower facilities.

'They were stopped when I made a complaint that my prison-issue gym tee-shirt going missing.

'We feel we are being punished collectively for being assertive.

'Women who attend gym courses are expected to train and then go to afternoon jobs and activities feeling filthy - it is totally degrading.'

She added: 'Yes, we have sinks in our rooms but these are not exactly satisfactory.

'Why should we have to strip-wash in sinks in the 21st century?

'Now the showers that were built specifically for inmates are being used by prison staff only.

'Do we have a right to a shower after taking part in physical gym activity?

'Is this the only jail that fails to promote and provide good health and hygiene?'

According to a source, West is a 'regular user' of the gym and has 'lent her support' to the campaign to get the shower ban overturned.

The source said, however, there was no specific Prison Service Instruction (PSI) which requires jails to provide showers in jail gyms.

He said: 'The PSI 2011-058 which covers physical education for prisoners does not mention shower provision.'

A spokesperson for HMP Low Newton said that prisoners were 'returned' to their cells after workouts in the gym.

She said: 'Prisoners are returned to their living areas after exercise.'

She also said there was 'ample time' for them to wash outside the confines of the gym before starting work.

West was convicted, by a unanimous jury, of the murders of 10 young women at Winchester Crown Court in November 1995.

The crimes for which she was convicted took place largely between April 1973 and August 1979.

She murdered Charmaine West, the daughter of her husband's previous wife Rena, in June 1971. The eight-year-old's body was buried at the West's former home, 25 Midland Road in Gloucester.

One of the body's discovered at the couple's Cromwell Street home, dubbed the House of Horrors, was their daughter Heather.

The 16-year-old was killed by her father after being abused by Rose and raped by Fred. She was buried under the patio at the house, which has since been torn down and paved over creating a public walkway.

In August 1992 Fred West was arrested after being accused of raping his 13-year-old daughter. Rose was arrested for child cruelty at the same time.

But the case against the couple collapsed when the young girl refused to testify against her parents.

The investigation brought to light the absence of Heather and sparked an inquiry into her disappearance.

The couple had given various explanations for Heather's disappearance, telling one person she had gone to Wales with a lesbian and another that the teenager had left home after assaulting one of her siblings.

Fred West hanged himself while he was on remand at Birmingham's Winson Green Prison, charged with 12 murders.

Sentencing Rose, Mr Justice Mantell condemned her to spending the rest of her life in prison.

Eighteen months later the Justice Secretary Jack Straw echoed the sentiment, subjecting West to a life tariff. It was only the second time a woman had been condemned to die behind bars. The other was Myra Hindley.

In July the European Courts of Human Rights declared that whole life tariffs are illegal. West will now receive a new minimum term from the High Court.
