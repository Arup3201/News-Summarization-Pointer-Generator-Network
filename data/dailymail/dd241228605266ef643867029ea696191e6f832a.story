Romanian beggars who were given taxpayer-funded tickets home in July have already returned to the streets of London.

A group of 20 homeless Roma were put on flights and coaches back to Romania by the UK Border Agency after their camp in Park Lane was cleared by police.

But, Westminster City Council has said six of the group have travelled back and are sleeping rough on the streets again.

The council, which spends more than £500,000 a year tackling the problem, said their return was a 'farce' and called on the government to tighten border controls.

One Conservative MP said Britain was 
effectively funding short holidays for beggars in Romania, while 
powerless to stop them coming back.

Under European Union law, Romanians have a right to be in this country for 90 days. After that, they have to 
be working, studying or self-sufficient to be able to stay.

Sleeping rough and begging are 
grounds for removal.

By 
offering to pay for travel home the Government is avoiding a potentially
expensive legal battle, which can only begin once the 90-day limit has 
been passed.

Councillor Nickie Aiken said Home Secretary Theresa May needed to get a grip on the situation and added: 'We need to get stricter at the border, particularly if these people have agreed to go home in the first place at taxpayers' expense.

'The return of the Roma back in Park Lane just weeks after going home at the UK's taxpayers' expense renders the efforts to tackle and manage this problem an utter farce.

'It is evidence that the taxpayer is funding aggressive beggars to return home for a short holiday before they promptly reappear on the streets of Westminster.'

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: 'The only way we can deal with this is to end our EU membership on the current terms.

'These people have been paid to go home to Romania for a short summer holiday.'

Other Roma sent home by coach had their tickets paid for by Thames Reach, a homelessness charity funded by London's local authorities and other public bodies.

A spokesperson for the charity said: 'There are particular issues in relation to Romanian rough sleepers and those engaged in street activity which may mean some choose to return.'

After January 1, restrictions in place in Britain on Romanians and Bulgarians will be removed. The change does not affect the status of the Romanian beggars in London, but could cause an influx of people from the two countries. 

The Home Office said it was 'focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement' and has demanded the European Commission tighten EU laws.

A spokesman said: 'If someone with no permission to be in the UK refuses to return home voluntarily, we will take action to remove them.

'This includes Europeans who have been in the country for longer than three months and are not working, studying or self-sufficient.

'Border staff have the power to refuse entry to EU nationals on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health.'

The Home Office said it was unable to say whether the Roma it had funded to go home had since returned.
