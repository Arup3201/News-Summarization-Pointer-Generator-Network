As they trudged away from the disastrous Gallipoli campaign, the thoughts of Tommies fortunate enough to have survived inevitably turned to loved ones at home.

But one of the First World War soldiers had something else on his mind.

Among his belongings was a native tortoise that he had found comfort in caring for as artillery shells exploded around him and bullets whistled past.

Veteran: Blake the tortoise was brought back to Britain by a soldier from the First World War nearly 100 years ago. He is now looking for a new home

So when it came to heading thousands of miles back to Britain on a troop ship in 1916, the pet came too.

What became of the soldier, known only
as Mr Marris, remained unclear yesterday except that he died many years
ago. But Blake, as the spur-thighed tortoise is called, is still going 
strong 96 years later.

The story has only now come to light 
after his current owner, Marion Skinner, felt she was no longer able to 
care for him properly because he was getting a bit ‘geriatric’ and asked
an animal charity to help.

Still fit: Dillon Prest (pictured with Blake), general manager at Swallow Equatics in East Harling, Norfolk, said the tortoise is still fit and lively despite his age

Long life: Blake has outlived his first owner by more than 30 years

Ancient: Tortoises often outlive their human owners - with some reaching up to 150 years of age

The retired office manager, 67, from 
Neatishead, Norfolk, took possession of Blake in 1983 after advertising 
for a female tortoise she could use for breeding. ‘A Mrs Marris 
contacted us and said she had a female tortoise she was willing to let 
us have,’ she said.

‘When we went to her house we saw it 
was male but we decided to take it anyway. While we were there she told 
us where the tortoise had come from.’

The sun-baked peninsula of Gallipoli 
in Turkey takes its name from an ancient Greek word meaning ‘beautiful 
city’. But it became hell on earth during the bloody campaign between 
April 1915 and January 1916.

Hell: The Gallipoli campaign against Turkey claimed the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers

Bloodbath: The campaign ended in disaster for the Allies after their troops came under heavy artillery fire from Ottoman forces

The Allies launched an attack 
on Gallipoli in the Dardanelles in April 1915 during World War I, in a bid to capture the 
Ottoman Empire's capital, Istanbul.

Troops quickly became 
bogged down on beaches under devastating Turkish 
artillery fire.

The assault was eventually called off in 
January 1916 after almost 400,000 casualties on both sides.

There were nearly half a million casualties during the campaign, according to the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs, and many more soldiers became sick due to  unsanitary conditions, especially from enteric fever, dysentery and diarrhea.

The British-French operation was 
intended to capture Constantinople, now Istanbul, and open a sea route 
to Russia. The Turks prevailed and 400,000 lives were lost on both 
sides.

Mrs Skinner, who has kept more than 20
tortoises over the years, said the ideal place for Blake – so called 
because he lived with the Marrises in Blakeney, near Norwich – would be 
his native home in Turkey. There would be problems getting him through 
customs, however, so a sunny British garden with plenty of weeds and 
wildflowers to munch on would be the next best thing.

A warm, dry shelter, such as a 
greenhouse or utility area with UV lamp, would also be needed in cold 
weather. Wherever he ends up, he does have one other need – he is still 
mating despite his advancing years. ‘He’s truly astonishing,’ said Mrs 
Skinner.

Dillon Prest, who is temporarily 
looking after Blake, said: ‘He is really quite fit and raring to go. The
only problem is that he has cataracts, which have proven difficult when
he meets a female tortoise he quite likes.’

Eleanor Tirtasana of the Tortoise Club
in Bracon Ash, near Norwich, which is trying to find him a permanent 
home, said: ‘Many tortoises can live well into their hundreds, meaning 
they often outlive their owners.’
