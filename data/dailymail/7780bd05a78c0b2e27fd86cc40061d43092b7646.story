Claims: Fred Talbot arriving at court today, where it was heard he staged a naked 'orgy' on a canal boat

TV weatherman Fred Talbot coerced schoolboys into stripping naked and pretending they were having an orgy on a canal barge before fondling one of them on board, a court heard.

Talbot, now 65, was working as a  teacher in the 1970s when he allegedly asked the boys to lie on top of others who were pretending to be girls during a school trip.

Today one of the former pupils, aged around 14 at the time, said the 'orgy' went on for up to two hours - with explicit photographs being taken as Talbot and two adult friends watched.

He then had to share Talbot's bed and the teacher sexually assaulted him, he said. A total of ten boys were said to have been involved in the 'orgy'.

The witness is one of five  who say Talbot sexually assaulted them as pupils before going on to become a charismatic TV personality.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s Talbot was a regular on ITV's This Morning, where he presented weather updates from a floating map in Liverpool's Albert Dock.

The witness said the 'orgy' took place on a weekend school trip in the mid-1970s organised by Talbot when he taught biology at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Greater Manchester.

The boy was 'quite drunk' after Talbot, two adult friends and  older boys returned from the pub and shared beers  with younger boys, Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard.

He said: 'He then (Talbot) said "let's pretend we have got some girls back from the pub" and we had an orgy. He said we needed to take some photographs so you can pretend there is some girls here.

'We were very drunk. I think they turned the heat up and we took our clothes off. One boy would lie on another boy and would pretend the one underneath was a girl.

'They took a lot of photos.'

In charge: Talbot coerced a group of boys into posing naked on top of each other for photos, the jury heard

He recalled one of Talbot's friends on the trip was a man in his late 20s or early 30s nicknamed Spider, who wore biker-type clothing.

The witness said Talbot was 'in charge' and 'telling us what to do'.

'We were innocent,' he said. 'We didn't know anything. Basically it was his thing... he decided when it started and finished.'

He said the 'orgy' went on for up to two hours before everyone went to sleep.

Talbot then said the boy should stay in his double bed because there were not enough bunk beds for everyone, the witness said.

The pair slept naked behind a partition before Talbot fondled the teenager and persuaded him to perform a sex act on him, the court heard. 

A prosecuting lawyer said 'the qualities that made Fred Talbot successful as a TV celebrity - his boundless energy - helped him gain the boys' trust'. The accused is pictured while presenting on ITV's This Morning

'He showed me what to do,' the witness said. 'He said this is natural and this is how men touch other men, because I didn't know what was going on.'

The following morning he said that Talbot told him to never speak about the incident or of the photographed 'orgy' and it was their secret.

He told the jury he had few friends and lacked confidence at school, which meant he was flattered by the attentions of the 'friendly, kind of hip' Talbot.

The court heard the witness had complained to police about Talbot in 1992, but police closed the investigation because of a lack of evidence.

'I felt it was my responsibility because this kind of person was at large and they would be continuing their activities,' he said. 'There was nothing particular to gain for myself. I just thought it was the right thing to do.'

Career: The claims date to when Talbot was a biology teacher at Altrincham Grammar, Greater Manchester

Trial: Talbot, 65, denies indecently assaulting five boys at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court (above)

He said he wrote to police again in 1996 and provided a statement about the alleged abuse, but later admitted this account had been 'exaggerated'.

'I think I was angry and annoyed that the prosecution had not gone ahead,' he said. 'It was a very stupid thing to do.'

He withdrew the exaggeration, but made  complaints against Talbot again in 1998 and 2000.

The witness said he had never made a claim for compensation, and denied  wanting to make one in the future. 

Talbot, 65, denies indecently assaulting five boys between the late 1960s and the early 1980s.

The trial continues.
