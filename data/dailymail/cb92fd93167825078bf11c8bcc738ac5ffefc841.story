This is the first picture of the 11-year-old boy struck by lightning outside his school as Britain's worst storm in 30 years raged yesterday.

First aiders who came to the rescue of Joe Compton found himÂ  unconscious, face down in the mud outside Dorcan Academy in Swindon, Wiltshire.

The year seven pupil suffered severe burns and went into cardiac arrest after he was struck by the bolt at 3.10pm yesterday afternoon.

Stuart Arthur, 37, who was standing in the reception at Dorcan Recreation Centre when the storm hit, arrived first on the scene to administer CPR.

'I heard a horrendous crack and there was a bright white light - I knew then that something was wrong,' said Mr Arthur, who is operations manager at the leisure centre.

'I ran outside and found the young lad face-down and unconscious. Luckily the training kicked in and we were able to perform emergency procedures on him.

'We assessed whether he was breathing and it was apparent that he was not so I started CPR.

'While I was performing CPR we got no immediate response but we were not really expecting any, you don't tend to get a response straight away.'

Mr Arthur continued CPR while other staff members ushered on cars and comforted Joe's sister, who had witnessed the incident.

His colleague Stephanie Woodman, 38, who was also in reception when the bolt struck, grabbed a defibrillator and rushed to help.

The assistant manager said: 'We heard this amazing sound and just as a lightning bolt struck, it sounded like a big explosion.

'I didn't know what it was, I just grabbed the emergency kit and went running out. It could have been a car crash, an explosion or anything, it was so loud.

'Then I just saw him lay on the floor and I began to clean him up and put on the defibrillator.'

Ms Woodman used the defibrillator to monitor Joe's heartbeat but did not use it properly before paramedics arrived to take over.

Home time horror: The Dorcan Academy in Swindon where Joe is a pupil

Paramedics arrived at the scene in six
minutes and managed to revive the youngster before taking him to Great 
Western Hospital in Swindon, where he was treated before being 
transferred to the specialist major trauma centre at Frenchay Hospital, 
in Bristol.

He was 
'conscious and breathing' when he arrived at Great Western but medics 
there last night said he suffered 'potentially life threatening 
injuries'.

Pippa Smith, 24, a teacher at the school said the clash of thunder had made her and a fellow teacher scream in shock.

She
said: 'It was very loud and sounded like it was right over head, when 
the thunder came myself and another teacher just screamed.

'It was very loud and very scary. There was a really bright light and then the bang. It only struck once.'

The
English teacher added that she had only heard about the incident via a 
text from a friend and was really shocked by the news.

The
large school, which specialises in technology for pupils aged 11-16 is 
situated next to a busy sports centre, but none of the users had 
witnessed the lightning strike.

Injuries: Joe suffered severe burns and went into cardiac arrest after the strike

A
spokesman for Great Western Ambulance Service said: 'We received a 999 
call from the school regarding a pupil, believed to be an 11-year-old 
boy, reportedly being struck by lightning.

'We had a paramedic on the scene at 3.16pm, backed up by an ambulance crew a few minutes later.

'There were first aiders from the school performing CPR as the boy had gone into a cardiac arrest.

'Our
crews took over on arrival and they had a return of spontaneous 
circulation. We took the boy to Great Western Hospital and arrived at 
3.34pm.

'He suffered potentially life threatening injuries from the electrocution.'

Officers from Wiltshire police also attended the incident to assist paramedic crews with the boy.

Joe
was conscious and breathing when he arrived at Great Western Hospital 
where he was described as 'not in a critical condition'.

But
a medical source added: 'Unfortunately, because the boy has been struck
by lightning there will be damage to tissue and organs and so his 
condition could change.'
