This is the face of the brave 15-year-old who is determined to find out what happened on the night aÂ  fire ravaged her features and almost killed her.

Doctors at specialist burns unit in Chelmsford thought Terri Calvesbert, then just 18 months old, would die from the 90 per cent burns, but incredibly, she pulled through.

Now, she wants answers from her estranged mother Julie Minter, who accidentally started the fire by leaving a lit cigarette in her daughter's bedroom at their Ipswich home.

Terri lost her hair, nose and eyes in the devastating blaze, but her 32-year-old mother refuses to set a date to meet and talk about what happened.

Ms Minter was so wracked with guilt after the episode that she cut off almost all contact with her husband and daughter.

Terri now lives with her 39-year-old father Paul, a community fire volunteer and stepmother Nicky, 44, but says she is still haunted by the past and desperate to know what happened.

'Only Mum can tell me what happened in that fire,' she told Closer magazine. 'But at the moment she can't or won't.

'It just makes me angry. It would mean so much to me to hear it from her.'

In tears: Julie Minter, 39, walked out on her baby and husband Paul, right, because she could not cope with the guilt over the accident

Ms Minter left the family just two months after the accident, and Terri has had more than 50 painful operations since then to stretch her scarred skin.

The teenager, who wears a blonde wig, will continue to need surgery and skin grafts for the rest of her life.

Her plight has touched thousands of hearts and donations have poured in from all over the world.

Her mother last spoke out in Closer magazine five years ago, when she said: 'I don't know what made me leave my cigarette... I play that moment over and over in my head.'

She tried desperately to save her baby but smoke and flames forced her back.

'I couldn't go in, I couldn't see anything,' she said. 'I went outside to see if I could smash the [ground floor] window but nothing worked.

'All I could shout was, "My baby's on fire."'

Suffering: Terri says she has forgiven her mother for the accident, but it is harder to forgive her walking out

Horrifically, the firefighters who saved Terri thought she was a charred doll. Only the area under her wet nappy had escaped terrible burns.

Ms Minter said she would have killed herself if she had stayed, and was only able to cry uncontrollably at the consequences of her actions.

After moving out from the family's home, she eventually stopped visiting the hospital completely.

In 2008, she asked her daughter to see her, and they met regularly for several months before the visits petered out.

They now have not met for more than a year, although they text regularly.

Terri now says she feels strong enough to know more about the fire - including details about why her mother could not save her.

The teenager, who is studying for GCSEs in maths and science, says she has forgiven her mother for the accident - but finds it harder to forgive her for leaving afterwards.

Ms Minter was unavailable for comment at the time of the interview.

Terri appeared today on This Morning, where a clip of her in Channel 5 documentary Extraordinary People was shown.

During one moving scene, Terri bursts into tears as a wig is fitted.

The 15-year-old first appeared on the programme when she was just ten. Her father told the ITV show's presenter Holly Willoughby that he wanted people to see it was still possible to lead a normal life after such an episode.

'She's grown up a lot,' he said. 'It shows how independent she is.'

Terri added: 'I wanted to get people to realise what I'd been through.

'If anyone else had been through the same they would know how to help people.'

Mr Calvesbert added: 'It's something you live with all your life. Terri will always need skin grafts where she grows.

'If you had told me 13 years ago she'd be where she is now I wouldn't have believed it.

'It is something - you have to have hope and strength in your own mind, to bring Terri through it.

'At the beginning i was very shy, I wouldn't speak to anyone. It's given me a lot of encouragement.'

Terri has had more than 40 operations, and is hoping to have a thumb constructed next.

When she is 18 and has finished growing, surgeons will begin reconstructing her nose.
