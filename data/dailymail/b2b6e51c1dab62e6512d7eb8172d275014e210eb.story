The first man struck in Marion 'Suge' Knight's deadly hit-and-run later told officers that he physically assaulted the former rap mogul before the confrontation, a police report reveals. 

'I f***** him up!' Cle 'Bone' Sloan, a former gang member, told the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, according to the documents. 

Sloan reportedly admitted to attacking Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row records, as he lay in a hospital bed suffering from multiple head wounds. 

Terry Carter, a 55-year-old father, was the second man to be hit by Knight's truck. He died from the injuries he sustained.

Marion 'Suge' Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder after a hit-and-run incident on January 29 in a Compton, California, parking lot. His lawyer Matthew Fletcher, pictured left on March 9, has said that 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail'

Sloan, 51, allegedly said that he had a verbal dispute on January 29 with Knight three miles away from the scene of the hit-and-run, according to the New York Daily News. 

It is believed to have been a result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.' 

He then allegedly headed straight for Knight when he saw him at Tam's Burgers in Compton, California, - the location of the hit-and-run - about half an hour later.

'Sloan said he contacted Knight and began to punch him through the driver side window,' the report read. 'Sloan stated Knight tried to exit the red Ford but was stopped by his punches.'

Sloan was walking away when he heard someone say, 'Look out', according to his account to the police. 

He said he was trying to turn around but was then struck by Knight's Ford F-150 Raptor. 

Knight's lawyer told the Daily News that Sloan had initiated both confrontations and that the former rapper never left his car. 

'Sloan is trying to exculpate himself but all the while he's just killing himself. It's monumental,' lawyer Matthew Fletcher told Daily News.

Knight (pictured on March 9, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is in jail without bail. His lawyer Fletcher has said that Knight never exited the vehicle and was acting in self defense

'What Sloan has done is admit he initiated this fight. Suge never exited his vehicle. He was accosted by Sloan who challenged him to fight,' he added.

Fletcher had previously said that Knight was acting in self defense to get away from what he thought was an armed assault. 

Carter made a one-minute call to Knight at 2.36pm the day of the incidents, phone records included in the police report said. 

Nineteen minutes later, police were called to Tam's about the alleged hit-and-run. 

Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder, but he pleaded not guilty and is in jail without bail. 

Though prosecutors claim Knight intentionally hit Sloan and Carter with his truck, Fletcher believes 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail'. 

'Sloan's own words probe he drove across the entire city of Compton in order to have a confrontation with Mr Knight,' Fletcher told the Daily News. 'Mr Sloan proved by his own words what his intentions were and what he accomplished.'
