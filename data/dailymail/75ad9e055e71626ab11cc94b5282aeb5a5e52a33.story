McDonald's has been forced to open its first ever restaurant with a turquoise coloured sign after city planners said the signature yellow sign would be too garish.

Officials in Sedona, Arizona told the fast-food giant they were unable to open a restaurant with the trademark yellow logo.

This is due to the city's strict regulations which prevent buildings from ruining the picturesque view of the desert.

The building has also been built using orange and red coloured materials meaning it blends in with the desert background

To appease the city's concerns, McDonald's offered up a unique alternative to their standard colour scheme - using a turquoise M sign.

The building has also been built using orange and red coloured materials meaning it blends in with the desert background.

But the restaurant isn't the chain's only unusual storefront as many of their 30,000 other restaurants can be found in bizarre locations.

Earlier this month, McDonald's opened up an outlet in a disused DC-3 plane that had been parked beside the restaurant in Taupo, New Zealand.

The grounded passenger plane, with its refurbished red and silver interior and seating for 20, is very much a part of the restaurant and customers can enjoy their meal within the comfort of the cabin

Eileen Byrne, the restaurant's 59-year-old owner, says: 'The site was previously part of a car dealership, the Aeroplane Car Company, and the owner bought a disused DC-3 plane, which sat alongside the building.

'And when McDonald's purchased the site in 1990, the aeroplane came with it.'

The DC-3 plane has been painted in traditional McDonald's colours, with the company's iconic lettering on the exterior, too.

Diners can access the plane via a flight of stairs near the tail, and the public must go through the restaurant in order to enter the aircraft.

Another unusual storefront is at Downey, California, the company's first ever restaurant, which still retains a classic 1950s feel.

Built in 1953, it still has its original red-striped exterior, giving it an appearance quite different from the other restaurants around the world.

The unique, time-capsule appearance of the restaurant is completed by the 1950s-style uniforms the staff wear, and the original recipe hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and milkshakes.

Other unusual stores include the branch in Clifton Hill, Melbourne, Australia, which has an art deco feel and features a retro dining room and neon lighting.
