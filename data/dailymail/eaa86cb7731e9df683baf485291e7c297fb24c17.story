It seems there is only one must-have accessory at the Liberal Democrat conference in rainy Brighton: A badge declaring ‘I’m A PLEB!’

Hundreds of the novelty badges have been sold in the last 24 hours, inspired by Vince Cable’s declaration that he was a ‘pleb’ who could not resist a dig at Andrew Mitchell, who is under pressure over claims he used the four-letter word during a rant at Downing Street police.

Senior Lib Dems think there is political capital to be gained from siding with the police – and the ‘plebs’ – in the big political division of the week.

Mr Mitchell continues to face questions over what exactly he said to the police.

Friends say he admits swearing, but denies using the word 'pleb'.

But an official police log, leaked today, shows officers stand by their account of the row which happened last Wednesday when Mr Mitchell was told he could not ride his bike through the main Downing Street gates.

The ‘I’m a PLEB!’ badges have been the biggest seller on the Lib Dem merchandise stand today, outstripping mugs, badges and magnets featuring the party’s MPs down the years.

According to staff, more than 200 ‘I’m a PLEB’ badges have been bought for 25p since going on sale late on Monday.

Inspiration struck after Mr Cable told delegates: ‘I've been told that jokes about social class are not good for the unity of the coalition.

'But as a mere pleb I couldn't resist it.’

Inevitably, the battle to become the bestselling badge is being seen through the prism of a threatened leadership challenge.

More than 250 badges bearing Nick Clegg’s photo and his slogan ‘I’m 
sorry’ have been sold since Saturday but those in the know expect the 
Cable-inspired Pleb gifts to storm into the lead by tonight.

Most ministers are trying to shoehorn references into their speeches.

Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, began his keynote speech to delegates with the words: ‘Fellow plebs.’

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was in the audience to enjoy several jokes delivered by his senior minister.

In one tortuous section, Mr Alexander revealed his special advisor, 
Julia Church, was preparing to tie the knot when the finishing touches 
were being put to the March Budget which forced the Treasury into a 
number of policy reversals.

‘Not everything in the Budget this year was perfect,’ he said.

‘Julia Church, my brilliant special adviser was getting married a few weeks after the Budget in Cornwall.

‘I checked to make sure her future husband was not a caravan-dwelling 
church-going charity giver with a taste for pasties. And I will always 
think of that time as four U-turns and a wedding.’

As yet there are no Danny Alexander badges.
