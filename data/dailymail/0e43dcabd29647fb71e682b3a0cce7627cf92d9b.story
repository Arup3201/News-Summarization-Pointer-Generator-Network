A man sprayed liquid manure through his former neighbour's letterbox in a six-year-grudge over dog fouling.

Stewart Reid, 62, squirted the foul-smelling brown liquid from a bottle through the front door of his rival's home in New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, before running away.

He told police officers he was 'sorry' for the bizarre attack and on Monday at Peterhead Sheriff Court admitted threatening and abusive behaviour  and possessing a knife.

The court was told that Reid had known the home's occupants from when he used to live in the same village, and had also splashed paint over the house in the early hours of September 5.

Reid, who now lives in Portknockie, around 30 miles along the coast, was caught shortly after the attack by the owner's son - who spotted him as he attempted to make his getaway.

When police searched him they discovered he was carrying a knife, while his car - parked outside the village - contained bottles of manure, the liquid mixture and paint.   

'At that point he said he'd pay for the damage and was sorry,' Fiscal Stephanie Ross told the court, according to The Press and Journal.

Peterhead Sheriff Court was told it had cost the home-owners around £200 to clean up the mess left by Reid

The court was told it had cost the home-owners around £200 to clean up the mess left by Reid, and that the attack was the culmination of a six-year grudge Reid held over a dog fouling dispute with his former neighbours.

Ms Ross said: 'There had been an altercation some six years ago. Matters had been getting to him since then.'

Reid's agent, solicitor Gail Wiggins, said her client was 'wholly embarrassed' by his actions.

Reid is due to be sentenced on February 23 after Sheriff Andrew Miller deferred the hearing so that background reports could be prepared.
