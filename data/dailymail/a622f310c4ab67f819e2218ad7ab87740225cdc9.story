It could be the future of warfare and even help fend off pirate attacks.

Lockheed Martin today revealed new video of a laser weapon so powerful it can pierce the hull of a boat within seconds.

The weapon works over a distance of a mile, and could one day be fitted to ships.

The Ground-Based Laser System  successfully disabled two boats at a range of approximately a mile - and could soon be used o fend off pirate attacks

Designed for short-range defense of high-value areas including forward operating bases, the ADAM system’s 10-kilowatt fiber laser is engineered to destroy targets up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away.

It has a tracking range of more than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles).

The system has been designed to be flexible enough to operate against rockets as a standalone system and to engage unmanned aerial systems with an external radar cue.

The defence giant is developing the transportable, ground-based laser system to demonstrate a practical, affordable defense against short-range threats, including Qassam-like rockets, unmanned aerial systems and small boats.

In tests off the California coast, the Lockheed Martin prototype laser system successfully disabled two boats at a range of approximately 1.6 kilometers (approximately 1 mile), the firm confirmed today.

These were the first tests of the Area Defense Anti-Munitions (ADAM) system against maritime targets.

The defence giant is developing the transportable, ground-based laser system to demonstrate a practical, affordable defense against short-range threats, including Qassam-like rockets, unmanned aerial systems and small boats.

'In less than 30 seconds, the ground-based system’s high-energy laser burned through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military-grade small boats operating in the ocean,' the firm confirmed.

The system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles), and its 10-kilowatt fiber laser can engage targets up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away.

'Our ADAM 
system tests have shown that high-energy lasers are ready to begin 
addressing critical defense needs,' said Tory Bruno, president of 
Strategic and Missile Defense Systems, Lockheed Martin Space Systems 
Company.

'Putting revolutionary technologies to work in practical applications is a hallmark of innovation at Lockheed Martin.'

Designed for short-range defense of high-value areas including forward operating bases, the ADAM system’s 10-kilowatt fiber laser is engineered to destroy targets up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away. The system precisely tracks targets in cluttered optical environments and has a tracking range of more than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles).

The system has been designed to be flexible enough to operate against rockets as a standalone system and to engage unmanned aerial systems with an external radar cue.

'Our laser weapon initiatives leverage commercial products and processes, focusing on affordability for the user,' said Dr. Ray O. Johnson, Lockheed Martin senior vice president and chief technology officer.

'Lockheed Martin continues to invest in advancing fiber laser and beam control technologies, as these successful ADAM tests demonstrate.'
