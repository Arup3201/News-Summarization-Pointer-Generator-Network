Going to prison: Vincent Parker, 16, has pleaded guilty to murdering his parents last December

A 'smart' and 'sane' 16-year-old said he beat his parents to death over normal punishments, in court on Wednesday.

Tenth-grader Vincent Parker murdered his mother Carol, 57, and father Wayne, 55, in their Norfolk, Virginia home just before Christmas last year.

The only-child skipped school to carry out the slayings, which weren't spurned by any particular argument.

'I just remember getting mad,' Parker told the court. 'It's all from my dad. All this stuff like my dad taking away my iPod and stuff.'

Parker pleaded guilty to two counts of second degree murder, after a psychological evaluation found him to be both sane and intelligent. He was charged as an adult and will be sentenced in September.

Parker carried out the act on December 19, 2013 and left school early while his dad was still at work.

He showed up at the family home on the 100 block of Bland Ave, and surprised his mother exiting the upstairs bathroom by dousing her in pepper spray.

Parker went on to stab his mother in the eye, and beat her with a crowbar and metal baseball bat 'until she stopped breathing'.

A medical examiner noted 25 separate smashes and stabs on Mrs Parker's neck, face and head.

When his dad got back from work, Parker beat him with the crowbar and stabbed him multiple times.

Mr Parker was able to call 911 for help, but by the time authorities arrived on the scene it was too late for his wife.

Mr Parker was transported to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead, but not before fingering his son as the culprit.

Parker initially told police his father was the attacker, but later recounted and admitted to the beatings.

Investigators recovered five bloody knives, a baseball bat, and crowbar on the scene.

When police arrived on the scene, Parker's mother was already dead. Wayne Parker was later pronounced dead at the hospital

Parker was on the honor roll and had no criminal record before the murders.

While he will be sentenced as an adult, the District Attorney is going to ask that at least part of his sentence be served at a juvenile facility.

If sentenced with the maximum on both counts, Parker could face decades behind bars.

His maternal grandfather Allen Taylor says he has forgiven his grandson and is pulling for a shorter sentence.

'He is a smart young man. He is smart in school. I donâ€™t know what happened,' Mr Taylor told reporters outside court on Wednesday.

'I want him to get some type of counseling. Help him to grow up and to be an understanding man. Be sorry for what he did do. I told him to ask God to forgive him to what he did.
