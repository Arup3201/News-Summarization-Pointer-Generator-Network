Precious heritage: This rare 14th century Wenlok Jug was stolen from a British museum after donations had saved it from going abroad in 2006

A £1 million medieval jug stolen from a British museum was found in a Surrey lock up hidden between stacks of tyres, a court heard today.

The man who admitted handling the jug, 
Ronald Nash, 23, from Tadworth in Surrey was jailed for three 
years and three months 
at Luton Crown Court.

The Wenlok Jug is a national treasure, and one of only three in Britain.

It is so precious that the museum in Luton, Stockwood Discovery Centre, cannot now afford to display it because of insurance costs after the theft.

How the bronze 14th century Wenlok Jug came to be in Nash's lock up in Epsom, Surrey remains unknown, but it has now been safely returned.

Lawyer Abigail
Penny who defended Nash said that it was 'so valuable that it was probably 
unsaleable, which is probably why someone of 23 finds it's being offloaded on him'.

She argued that Nash was too naive to understand the value or significance of the item.

She also said that he was too frightened to tell the police about the jug.

When the jug was stolen last year, Crimewatch launched a national hunt and Zurich Insurance offered a £25,000 reward for its recovery.

It
is thought the jug was made for either William Wenlock, a Canon at St. Paul's Cathedral who died in 1391
and is buried in Luton.

The other owner could have been William's 
great nephew John, the first Lord Wenlock who lived near Luton and had 
associations with royalty.

Made of bronze, the jug weighs 6.1 kg and is 31.5 
cm tall.

It is decorated with coats of arms, badges 
and the inscription 'My Lord Wenlock'.

In 2005 the jug went up for sale at Sotheby's and was nearly sold to New York's Metropolitan Museum.

Its export was stopped that year by culture minister David Lammy after experts ruled it was of 'outstanding significance'

Police who had been watching Nash and co-defendant Louis Kybert, 25, from Banstead in Surrey, also 
found ecstasy and cocaine packaging in the lock up, as well as two stun guns disguised as mobile phones and body 
armour.

Kybert was jailed for five years after admitting owning the stun guns and being involved in supplying drugs.

Nash's 
sentence included one year for being implicated in supplying 
cocaine, and two years and three months for handling stolen goods. 

Tony Hart, a family friend of Nash was called as a character witness for him.

He said: 'Ronnie's never been no angel, he's always been cheeky, but he's always done good.'

'I don't know what's happened in the last year that has led up to this.'

Nash was told by Judge Laura Harris: 'You have been extremely vague on the circumstances in which the Wenlok Jug came into your possession.

'Individuals far more sophisticated than you, higher up the chain were involved in this matter. 

You have got into something way over your head.'

The jug was bought in 2006 by the Stockwood Discovery Centre for £750,000 with help from various trusts and private donations, which saved it from being sold to a museum in New York.

It was displayed in a high security cabinet which was smashed with a drain cover by the burglar on Saturday May 12 after 11pm.

Prosecutor Fayza Benlamkadem read a statement to the court from Karen Perkins, the director of Luton Museums.

Perkins said: 'It was wonderful to get the jug back, it had been totally devastating for staff and visitors.'

She said the knock-on effect had been that other valuable items had had
to be removed from display, and there was now a significant increase in
the cost of security which effected services that could be provided for
the community.

Happy ending: The jug has been returned to its home, as presented to Karen Perkins, director of the museum by the poilce
