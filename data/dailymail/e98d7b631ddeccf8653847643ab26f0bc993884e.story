Pro-life campaigners are often criticised for harassing women seen going into abortion clinics.

But the tables were turned  when a heavily pregnant lady hit back at anti-termination protesters demonstrating outside a London health centre  - leaving them lost for words.

The verbal dressing-down came as a worker for Blackfriars Medical Practice, a GP surgery offering abortion services in Southwark, confronted Abort67 members and asked them to stop filming to protect patient confidentiality.

Abort67 members denied specifically filming patients going into the surgery and claimed that they were using the cameras to provide evidence against those who accuse them of bullying tactics.  

A pregnant passer-by can then be seen approaching the group as they argue about the use of cameras, in footage uploaded toYouTube by journalist Sunny Hundal on Wednesday.

She tells the protesters: 'You are wrong in what you're doing.

'You don't know why people are doing what they're doing, but you want to be out here judging and then filming.'  

When one of the female protesters tries to fight back by claiming that she had an abortion in the past,  the lady labels her a hypocrite.

She said: 'You had an abortion but because you're not happy with what you're doing, you're standing out here making other people feel guilty. When you had an abortion, that was your choice. 

The pregnant woman tells the protesters that women should have choice

'Many people have been abused, you don't know what their reasons are for, so I think this is so wrong on so many levels.'

Referring to a recent incident in which a newborn baby was found dead in a wheelie bin in North Yorkshire, she adds: 'There was a baby on the news that got found in the bin. 

'Maybe if their mum didn't feel that way because of people like you, that baby wouldn't have died.

As the lady walks away, the protesters are left speechless by her words and are unable to argue back

'You think it's better for them to get rid of it at ten weeks (in the womb) or to actually go through with the birth and then kill the child?'  

The unnamed woman goes on to tell the group they should have researched about the local area before protesting  as the clinic is near to Kids Company, a charity providing support to vulnerable inner-city children.

Many of the children who go to the charity for help have been sexually abused or forced into sex work.

The woman said: 'There's Kids Company round there, where we're helping thousands and thousands of kids while you're out here. 

'You are in the wrong place, especially when we have our people that are going through their s*** , they're going to Kids Company where we're meant to help them, then they see this.'

She adds: 'To be standing out here and making other people feel guilty is so wrong.'

As the woman walks away, the protesters are left speechless and are unable to argue back.

Since the footage was uploaded, hundreds of people have taken to Twitter to applaud the woman for her 'inspiring speech'.

Thousands of pounds have also been given to the Kids Company 'Give a vulnerable child the gift of Christmas' campaign since the video was uploaded earlier today too.

The anti-abortion group Abort67 , which was started in 2008, has been confronting women going into the clinic with posters and leaflets showing pictures of  foetuses.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The YouTube video by Sunny Hundal which reveals the gentle nature by which we hold our displays serves to emphasise that abortion is indefensible. 

'Pro-aborts like Sunny can’t defend killing small human beings so he tries (in vain) to shame our volunteers for trying to defend the unborn child.'
