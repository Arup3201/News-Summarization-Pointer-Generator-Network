Police officers involved in the stand-off with Raoul Moat revealed today that Taser rounds fired at the cornered killer had 'no effect whatsoever'.

Gunman Moat was shot at twice with experimental Tasers by officers after he prepared to kill himself - with one round missing and the other striking him but having 'no effect'.

The wanted murderer had held a shotgun to his head and told police negotiators 'this is all going to end in this field tonight' shortly before he was fired at by officers using experimental X-12 shotgun Tasers.

Armed police, including one with a controversial Taser, are seen attempting to negotiate with Raoul Moat who shot himself in the head after a six-hour stand off

A jury at Moat's inquest heard the two West Yorkshire firearms officers - identified in court as Zulu 24 and Victor 24 - had received no formal training to use the weapons and had never fired an X-Rep projectile before.

Moat had shot and injured his ex-girlfriend Sam Stobbart, killed her new boyfriend Chris Brown and the next day blinded PC David Rathband last July.

He evaded a huge police manhunt for days until he was cornered in on a grassy area by the River Coquet in Rothbury, Northumberland.

The inquest is now trying to determine the sequence of events that led to Moat's death, and the revelation that the killer was Tasered just before his gun went off may establish a link between the two events.

During the stand-off, negotiators developed a good rapport with Moat, Zulu 24 told the jury at Newcastle Crown Court.

The man who declared war on police even told them where he had hidden a gun in woods as he did not want a child to find it, the officer said.

But the tone of negotiations became 'sinister' and the officer said: 'Moat went on to say he didn't want to be a drain on society, that he didn't want to go to jail, and one particular thing he did say was it was all going to end in this field tonight.'

Moat shuffled his feet, and in a swift movement brought the gun from under his chin and pointed it at his temple, the officer said.

'I thought he was going to shoot himself.'

Zulu 24, who was aiming an X12 shotgun at Moat's chest, fired.

He said: 'Moat let out a noise as if he had been struck by something. He has then rocked back slowly and then discharged the shotgun.

'I was aware my round had struck him. I don't think it had any effect.'

He said when he fired an X26 handgun-style Taser previously, it had made a loud, crackling noise, but that did not happen with the X12.

Coroner David Mitford asked: 'Was there any effect on Mr Moat?'

The witness replied: 'None whatsoever, sir.'

A sergeant identified only as Tango 21 told the court he heard the 'pop' of a Taser from the police line to his left hand side, then 'a second or two' later saw the X12 armed officer beside him fire his Taser.

Moat's body was pulled clear of the grass by police officers and paramedics.

The officer said: 'He had blood splattered across his face. His eyes were open but his eyeballs had rolled back.

'My overriding feeling was one of sadness that because of Moat's actions we had not been able to bring him to justice and bring him to court for what he was suspected of.'

He said each of the two firearms officers had fired their X12 Taser once.

He was asked whether being hit by a Taser round could have caused Moat to shoot himself by accident as a result of his muscles contracting on the shotgun trigger.

He said there was 'a clear pause' between the sound of the Taser shots and Moat flinching and the gunman shooting himself.

The second officer to fire an X12 at Moat missed, the inquest heard. The officer, identified as Victor 24, discharged his Taser shotgun with no effect on his target.

He said Moat's conversation had become more 'sinister', then he became silent as if gathering his thoughts. 'My honest belief is that he was about to commit suicide,' the firearms officer said.

Victor 24 aimed his X12 at Moat and heard a nearby colleague fire a cartridge at the ex-doorman.

The officer said Moat, who was sitting down with his sawn-off shotgun at his temple, shrieked, rocked back then righted himself.

Victor 24 realised his colleague's Taser had not incapacitated Moat so he fired.

The officer did not see where his projectile went and accepted the cartridge was later recovered from the river.

Almost immediately after he fired, there was then a 'muffled bang' from Moat's direction, he said. The killer went limp and fell backwards.

Under cross-examination, Victor 24 said: 'It was do something, or do nothing and watch him commit suicide.'

The officer in charge of the police operation has previously defended the use of the experimental Tasers, claiming it gave them the 'one chance' to bring him in alive.

Police feared the gunman intended to end his rampage of violence by attacking marksmen and committing 'suicide by cop' so breached the police's code of practice, the inquest was told last week.

Northumbria Police Assistant Chief Constable Steve Ashman was offered the use of the non-lethal X-Rep Taser shotguns on the day detectives discovered Moat intended to kill innocent members of the public.

The weapons were used during the stand-off on the riverbank, when Moat shot himself using a sawn off shotgun as officers pointed guns and Tasers at him.

X-Rep Tasers fire a cartridge for 30 metres, whereas standard police Tasers have a range of just seven metres.

Mr Ashman said he had to balance breaking the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) code of conduct, which forbade the use of non-approved weapons, with Moat's right to life under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act.

He said the decision to use the guns meant 'the buck stopped with him'.

Mr Ashman, who led Operation Bulwark, the mission to find and capture the fugitive, said he wanted to bring in Moat alive to face justice.

He said: 'We had reached the stage where there did not appear to be many alternatives.

'I was constantly having to reassess and re-evaluate my position; to stop us from sliding into a plan which had only one outcome.

'Moat had to face justice for what he had done but I also had a duty to protect his life.

'An opportunity had been presented to me, one I had not thought of but one which I was duty bound to examine because it gave us possibly the only chance, possibly one chance and one chance only, a single chance to apprehend him without using lethal force, without shooting and killing him.'

Mr Ashman said anyone going within seven metres of a killer armed with a loaded shotgun would be 'foolish'.

But he said that as well as being a breach of the Acpo code, he knew the use of the X-rep carried a risk, one of which was that he had 'no idea' of what the physiological impact would be.

He said: 'This was a situation that was in extremis, at the far end of the scale in terms of the threat that he presented and with that I was duty bound to consider all the options available to me to achieve the objective. There was nothing else.'

The inquest continues.
