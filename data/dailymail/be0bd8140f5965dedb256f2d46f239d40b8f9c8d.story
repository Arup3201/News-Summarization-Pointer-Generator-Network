Horrific: Lord Dalmeny has admitted his comment about the concentration camp, made at an event in London's Hurlingham Club, was 'horrific'

A Tory-supporting peer has been forced to apologise after making a joke about Auschwitz at a glittering party function attended by David Cameron.

Lord Dalmeny, chairman of auctioneers Sotheby’s UK, has now admitted his comment about the concentration camp was ‘horrific’.

Guests at last week’s Black And White Party at the exclusive Hurlingham Club in London were said to be shocked by the  ill-judged remark.

It came as Lord Dalmeny, whose wife Caroline was a Tory Cabinet aide, conducted a fundraising auction.

Sweltering under the lights, he quipped: ‘Turn those horrible lights down – I feel like I am in Auschwitz.’

It was not Lord Dalmeny’s only politically incorrect joke of the evening. Pouring scorn on France’s socialist president Francois Hollande, he referred to the French as ‘frogs’.

And when auctioning the original copy of Mr Cameron’s speech on the EU referendum last month, he said: ‘This is a Gideons Bible for people who do not trust foreigners very much.’

Lord Dalmeny last night apologised for his ‘horrific’ Auschwitz wisecrack.

He said: ‘I’m sorry if anyone was offended. I meant to say “Colditz”. It  was a horrific slip of the tongue.’

The Black And White Party is the social highlight of the Tory calendar and one of the party’s main fundraising events. This year’s bash was attended by a raft of Cabinet Ministers, including party chairman Grant Shapps, who is Jewish.

It is not the first time that Lord Dalmeny’s behaviour has hit the headlines.

At an auction last October, attended by Princess Beatrice, he referred to the Tories as ‘c***s’.

In 2011, he acted as auctioneer for an event to mark what would have been the late Freddie Mercury’s 65th birthday dressed in a sober grey suit, cut away at the back to reveal suspenders, PVC shorts and fishnet stockings.

Although Lord Dalmeny has no formal role within the party, he has performed as a fundraising auctioneer for the Tories before.

And his wife Caroline has worked as an advisor to Lord Strathclyde who left the Cabinet last month, and for Michael Portillo when he  was a senior party figure.

Comments: Lord Dalweny, who is chairman of auctioneers Sotheby's UK, made other politically incorrect comments, referring to the French as 'frogs'

Lord Dalmeny is the heir to the Earl of Rosebery, who lost his seat in the House of Lords in 1999 when most hereditary  peers were thrown out.

Friends of Dalmeny defended him last night and pointed out that he had raised £120 million for charity by offering his services as an auctioneer free.

Last week alone, he presided, unpaid, over four charity events.

A Conservative Party spokesman last night said: ‘Lord Dalmeny has rightly apologised. His comments were utterly inappropriate and unacceptable.’

But Labour branded the remark ‘absolutely disgraceful’ and suggested the Tories should donate the proceeds of last week’s event to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
