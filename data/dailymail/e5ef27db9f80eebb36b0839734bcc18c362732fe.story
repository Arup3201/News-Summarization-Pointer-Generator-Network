A pristine community garden in East London that took volunteers three years to create has been decimated by flytippers. 

Yobs dumped 49 tonnes of junk – equivalent to the weight of around four double decker buses – on a horticultural oasis the size of a football field on Mabley Green in Hackney, East London.

Hackney Council has already spent £10,500 moving the mountain of construction and household waste, including rubble and glass, with clear-up costs set to increase further.

What the garden space looked like before rubbish was dumped illegally. Hackney council are investigating the incident on Mabley Green in East London.

Council officials are trawling CCTV footage, looking for witnesses and making vehicle registration checks to find the perpetrators. 

Waste companies warned last year the UK faced an epidemic flytipping problem after the Government drastically increased taxes on dumping rubbish in authorised landfill sites. 

The Good Samaritans together with community groups transformed a chunk of land on the edge of the A12 road in East London into a lush garden with plum trees and wild garlic.

The clear up begins after flytippers dumped 49 tonnes of waste in a horticultural oasis in East London that took volunteers 3 years to create.

Garden in bloom: The now destroyed section of Mabley Green where plum and apple trees and garlic plants once grew.

Now they face a massive clear-up operation to restore the garden to what it once looked like.

Damian Rafferty, chairman of Mabley Green Users Group, said he was “gutted”.

“I received a message over the weekend saying some rubbish was there, but when I went down to investigate I was shocked and heartbroken,” he said.

'We’d put so much work and effort into it and it meant so much to people. I still feel incredibly sad about the whole thing.'

He added: 'I just can’t believe how selfish the culprits are.'

Distraught local residents also took to 
Twitter today to express their dismay. Dee Dee tweeted: 'Very sad 
wildflower meadow has been destroyed.'

Councillor Feryal Demirci, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods told the Hackney Citizen: 'We will not tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour such as this shocking example of fly-tipping.'

'We will do everything we can to make sure that people who fly tip in Hackney are brought to justice.'
