A woman who was 'left with no bones in her nose' after being beaten with a hammer in a plush London hotel room has spoken of the night she and her two sisters were attacked.

Ohoud, 34, Kohlood, 36, and Fatima al-Najar, 31, were all left for dead in their room of the four-star Cumberland Hotel off Oxford Street, London, after being attacked by Philip Spence, 32, a court has been told.

Today Fatima has spoken of the moment she woke up to the sound of her sister, Kahlood, screaming as she was beaten over the head 'around 30 times' on April 6.

The mother-of-two, who had been asleep with her children aged seven and 11 at the time, told Southwark Crown Court that she tried to stop the attack, but was then beaten unconscious herself. 

Fatima al-Najar demonstrates how Spence beat her with a hammer in court today. She also told how she has been left without bones in her nose after the attack in a hotel room in west London

Kahlood al-Najar told Southwark Crown Court that she was woken to the sound of Spence shouting 'give me the f****** money' before he hit her over the head 'around 30 times'

The court was told that after beating Fatima and Kahlood unconscious, Spence then moved into the adjoining room where Ohoud was asleep in bed with her nephew.

Ohoud was then beaten so badly that a section of her brain had to be removed, and was unable to give evidence in court today because she can no longer speak, Kahlood said.

Before the night in question, the three women, who were visiting London from the United Arab Emirates, had spent the day visiting Buckingham Palace and the London Aquarium.

They had gone to sleep in two adjoining rooms of the luxury Cumberland Hotel, near to Mayfair and a stone's throw from London's West End, when the attack took place.

Kahlood recalled waking up to the sound of Spence shouting 'give me the f****** money'. She began screaming, which woke Fatima.

Fatima told the court: 'I just saw him with his hand up highly. I didn't know what it was he was hitting her with.

'I saw a man just attacking my sister I just got out of my bed and went to her trying to stop him. I was saying "What's happening, what is this?"

'He just started attacking me, I didn't know what was happening,' she said.

'He started attacking [my left side] but I was always moving so he was hitting me everywhere.'

She said he hit her 'many times' in the incident which sister Khulood said was 'like a dream'.

Fatima added it was 'like someone is under the water and they are sinking - that is the way I felt'.

She woke to hear her family shouting and screaming before losing consciousness for the second time, the court heard.

Fatima, who had a plaster covering her nose and also wore all black, burst into tears while leaving the witness box after laying eyes on Spence.

The women were sleeping in adjoining rooms like this one when Spence crept in to steal from them

'The nose is broken, there are no bones left inside,' she said. 

By the end of the terrible attack all three sisters were left unconscious with smashed skulls while their traumatised children cowered close by, prosecutors said.

The 'horrific onslaught' was part of a plan with Neofitos 'Thomas' Efremi who plotted with Spence and within an hour had withdrawn £5,000 from cashpoints using the victims' credit cards, the jury was told.

Trial: James Moss, (above) 33, has appeared in court alongside  Philip Spence, who denies the attempted murder of three tourists in a London hotel 

Prosecutor Simon Mayo QC, said: 'Three sisters who were visiting London from their home in the United Arab Emirates were subjected to a sustained and vicious attack as they slept in their beds at the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch.

'Each was struck repeatedly to the head by a man wielding a claw hammer - their skulls fracturing and splintering under the onslaught.

'The intention of their attacker, say the prosecution, was to kill them.'

Police and ambulance crews called to the scene described the gruesome aftermath as 'horrific'.

Mr Mayo added: 'The women suffered terrible injuries, one of them even lost part of her brain'. 

Jurors were shown CCTV stills of Spence, wearing a brown leather jacket, walking across the four-star hotel's lobby before making his way to the the fifth floor.

Khulood Al-Najjar was sleeping in the double room 7007 with her 11-year-old daughter and her sister Fatima who had arrived in the capital just hours earlier, the court heard.

Their sister Ohoud slept in the adjoining double room 7008 on the seventh floor of the upmarket hotel. 

Simon Mayo QC said: ‘As Khulood slept in her bed in room 7007 she was woken by a sound coming from the corner of the room.

‘She looked up and saw that the door to the adjoining room was open.

‘She noticed a man was searching through her handbag, that man was Philip Spence.

‘Spence briefly walked to the door to the adjoining room before he turned and approached Khulood in her bed. He leant over her and said to her “Give me f*****g money!”

‘At about the same time he raised the claw hammer he had in his hand and brought it down on her head not once but repeatedly. 

Her screams woke Fatima who saw Spence attacking her sister, jurors heard. 

‘Showing remarkable courage, Fatima got up from the bed and desperately tried to stop the attack on Khulood,' the QC said.

‘Spence however simply turned his attention to her and struck her repeatedly on her head with the hammer. She too lost consciousness.

‘A third sister, Ohoud, was subjected to a similarly ferocious assault as she lay in her bed in the adjoining room.

'Having left the women for dead lying In their beds, Spence collected a suitcase full of valuables and left the rooms where the injured lay.' 

Photos from the scene showed blood-spattered walls and white bed sheets covered in dark blood stains. 

Spence, of west London, has admitted carrying out the brutal burglary but he denies he meant to kill the women.  

The three women had come from their home in UAE to London for a shopping and sightseeing trip

Spence left Efremi's Islington home and made his was to the hotel shortly after midnight on April 6.

He returned to the address following the attack, using a mobile stolen in the raid to call his alleged co-conspirator.

Mr Mayo said: 'Within minutes of Spence arriving at Efremi's home, Efremi went out in possession of bank cards stolen from one of the victims to withdraw cash from cashpoints before the cards were blocked by the bank.

'in the course of just one hour the second defendant, Thomas Efremi, withdrew £5,000 in cash using the stolen cards.'

Detectives found two blood spattered-jackets worn by Spence in the attack were later found at Efremi's home.

They later recovered the mobile used by Spence to call Efremi, with the women's belongings, at the north London home of an alleged associate, James Moss.

Spence, of Hounslow, west London, denies three counts of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary.

He admitted three charges of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent at an earlier hearing.

Efremi, from  Islington, north London, has admitted one count of credit card fraud but denies conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary.

Moss, of Stroud Green, admitted handling stolen goods.

The trial continues.
