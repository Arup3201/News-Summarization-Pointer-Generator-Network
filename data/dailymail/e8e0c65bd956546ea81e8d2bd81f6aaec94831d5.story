Gus Poyet has assured Sunderland fans that he is still in the hunt for Liverpool’s Fabio Borini.

The Black Cats have had a £14million bid accepted for the striker who spent last season on loan at the Stadium of Light.

Borini, though, is yet to decide where his future lies, and Poyet, whose side kick off at West Brom on Saturday, said: ‘It’s still ongoing. I can assure the supporters it’s not over.

In the hunt: Gus Poyet is still keen on signing Fabio Borini, who spent last season on loan at Sunderland, from Liverpool for a £14m fee

Make your mind up: The Italian striker has yet to decide whether to move to Sunderland permanently 

‘Please trust me, I can’t tell you everything because it’s not fair on everybody.

‘It’s not that Borini doesn’t want to come. I have talked to him and things are clear, but it’s a matter of doing it at the right time.

‘In any case, he is just coming back to fitness and wouldn’t be available against West Brom.

‘We need a player in that position and we are ready to move on and have another option. It’s impossible to say it will happen tomorrow, Monday or the 31st of the month.’

Stay or go: Poyet is keen to keep Connor Wickham on Wearside and the club rejected a £5m offer from West Ham this week

Poyet, however, wants to keep Connor Wickham on Wearside. Sunderland rejected West Ham’s £5m bid for the striker this week, and Poyet added: ‘I’m ready for somebody to come in for any player because that’s football.

‘When you start the season with the transfer window open, you have to be ready for bids. Connor has been in my plans from the last eight games of last season. I am looking forward to seeing the same kind of form - playing for us and scoring goals.’
