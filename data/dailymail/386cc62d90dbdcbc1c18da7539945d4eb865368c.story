A serving police officer has been killed by a train at a level crossing two days after he was arrested over an alleged sex attack.

Ged Swash, 41, was declared dead at the scene after being struck by a train near Cowpen Bewley station in Billingham, County Durham.

Two days earlier Mr Swash, a father, had been arrested over an alleged sex attack on a woman, and was still on bail pending further investigation at the time of his death.

Claims: Two days before his death, police officer Ged Swash was arrested over an alleged sex attack on a woman. He was on bail pending further investigation at the time of his death

Mr Swash, who lived in Billingham, had been arrested on the morning of Sunday, March 9 following an allegation of a sexual offence against a woman while he was off duty.

He was bailed while his colleagues carried out further investigations.

As he was already absent from work due to injury at the time of arrest, Mr Swash was not suspended by the force while the investigation took place.

He had been off work from the Hartlepool headquarters of Cleveland Police due to injuries sustained after making an off duty arrest.

A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: 
'We can confirm the man who died following an incident on a railway line
 on Tuesday 11 March was 41-year-old Ged Swash, who was a serving police
 officer.'

'We can also 
confirm that this officer had been arrested on the morning of Sunday, 
March 9, following an allegation of a sexual offence on an adult female 
while off duty.'

Scene: As he was already absent from work due to injury at the time of arrest, Mr Swash was not suspended by the force while the investigation took place

'He was subsequently released on bail pending further enquiries.'

'Specially trained Family Liaison Officers are working with the family to support them in dealing with this tragic situation. Our thoughts are with the family, his friends and colleagues at this sad time,' the spokeswoman added.

Mr Swash worked in Cleveland Police’s vulnerable people protection unit and was a governor at Barley Fields Primary School in Ingleby Barwick. 

Graeme Leck, head teacher of Barley Fields Primary, told the Northern Echo: 'Ged was a much valued parent governor and will be sadly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.'

He was declared dead at the scene after being struck by the train and a full investigation into his death was opened yesterday.

The line was closed for around 90 minutes after the incident, which involved the 8.30pm Newcastle to Middlesbrough service.
