A BASE jumper in Oregon has fallen to his death after taking a solo leap from a 1,000-foot high tower

Zachary Sommer, 38, of Portland, told friends he was going for a jump on Wednesday evening, but never called back.

They worriedly called police on Thursday about 7am and gave them the location of the tower near Silverton, according to KPTV.

Officers from Marion County arrived at the scene and discovered Sommer's body.

Tragic: Zachary Sommer, 38, was BASE jumping from an aerial tower in Silverton, Oregon, on Wednesday night when he fell to his death

One of the responding officers, sheriff's depty Steve Cooper, who is an experienced base jumper, believes Sommer grabbed a lanyard as well as the handle to deploy his pilot parachute.

He believes this stopped the parachute from fully deploying.

'(The lanyard) was coming out from under his jacket, and it's very possible when he grabbed his pilot chute, he also grabbed that,' Cooper said.

'And that would certainly interfere with doing a proper pull.'

'It's sad and I know what the community will be going through,' Cooper added.Â 

'They're missing a friend.'

Scene: The aerial tower is on private property in Silverton, Oregon, just east of Salem

The tower is about 1,000 feet high.

Police do not want to disclose the actual location to stop any future BASE jumpers using the tower as a platform.

BASE jumping is not illegal in Oregon.

However the tower was on property private, so Sommer was trespassing.
