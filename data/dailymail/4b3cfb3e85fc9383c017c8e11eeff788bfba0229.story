He called himself 'Florian the Fuhrer' and delighted in making his classmates give him the 'Sieg Heil!' - Heil to victory - salute beloved of his idol Adolf Hitler.

Florian, 15, has emerged as one of two ringleaders of a class of grammar school children in Germany who worshipped at the dark side - disciples of a regime that vanished in fire and blood nearly seven decades ago.

Florian and his cohorts are the stuff of nightmares for modern-day democrats in Europe's most economically powerful country: educated, middle class, kitted out with the latest in Smartphones and teen-fashion who nonetheless prefer the darkest days of their nation's past as a source of inspiration for the future.

A pupil raises his right hand in the Hitler salute at Landsberg Grammar School in eastern Germany

Landsberg in eastern Germany has become the town of 'The Nazi Class', a group of 29 youngsters who authorities say some - or even most - worshipped at the shrine of Hitler.

Recently their sordid world blew apart when the photos the 15-year-olds of class 9A of the Landsberg Grammar School posted on the WhatsApp social media site were published.

Florian can be seen raising his right hand in the Hitler salute, his face obscured with a stuck-on Hitler moustache.

He and a pal called Leon - who nicknamed himself 'Julius' after Julius Streicher - are now under the microscope of the authorities.

Streicher is the infamous Jew-baiting pervert of Nazi Germany who was hanged at Nuremberg after the war for his crimes in conditioning an entire nation to think and act anti-Semitically at all times

All 29 children in the class were signed into the WhatsApp chatroom where the lurid messages of support for Hitler and his henchmen, along with vile anti-Jewish slurs, were traded on a daily basis

In the chatroom the students glorified Hitler and shared Nazi greetings, slogans and the odd anti-Jewish joke

All 29 children in the class - who had visited a concentration camp in Germany to learn about the crimes of the Third Reich - were signed into the WhatsApp chatroom where the lurid messages of support for Hitler and his henchmen, along with vile anti-Jewish slurs, were traded on a daily basis.

MailOnline travelled to this tiny, shell-shocked town of 12,000 people, which is now the centre of a full-blown criminal probe because the adulation of the Nazis, and the public display of their symbols and salutes, is a grave crime in modern-day Germany. 

It seems that the warning signs were either ignored or misread by teachers of the Nazi-virus growing within their young charges.

A school insider, a clerk in the administration office, said: 'Shortly before the holidays the teacher gave the class an art lesson and they were allowed to paint what they wanted.

'When she returned she was horrified to find many of them had chosen to paint portraits of Adolf Hitler.'

In the chatroom the students shared Nazi greetings, slogans, the fact that Hitler was a 'great man' and the odd anti-Jewish 'joke'. 

One of the last postings before authorities shut down their account was the picture of a clenched fist surrounded by a ring of stars and the words:

'Bock auf Nazis' - In the mood for Nazis.

School headmaster Lutz Feudel said the entire school had been shocked about the secret Nazi sympathisers

They routinely greeted each other in cyberspace with 'Heil Hitler!'

They used words like 'Ayran' and 'Volk' - the racist speak of the Nazis - and they lauded recent racist attacks in Germany, such as the firebombing of a synagogue in Wuppertal, as 'acts of resistance.'

A German dad has filed a complaint with police asking them to investigate 'The Nazi Class'

A legal complaint was made by Jewish man Eli Gampel, 54, who has a son in the class.

Gampel, the former head of the local Halle Jewish Community, added: 'I thought it was a bad dream when I opened newspapers and read the article.

'My boy told me that on the hood of his jacket someone had stuck a far-right NPD [National Democratic Party] sticker. It was well-known it seems that he was Jewish.

'It was on this basis that I have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation.

He said however that he was equally surprised that his son had not discussed the matter with him, and added that there had been tremendous peer pressure to stop anybody in the class mentioning what they were up to.

He added: 'Even after I read about it, I found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on. It was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true.'

Herr Gampel knows about the blind, unreasoning, ignorant hatred of the far right because it was visited upon the family home only recently.

The Gampels awoke to find slogans dating back to the Reichskristallnacht - the -so-called Night of Broken Glass of November 9 1938 - daubed upon the walls of their house.

Crystal Night was the beginning of the end for the Jews of Europe.

It started with the ransacking of Jewish property and the burning of synagogues, and ended with the burning of people, some six million of them, in places like Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz.

That is why for Eli Gampel, and for all the good burghers of Landsberg, it is so incomprehensible to think that their children could be attracted to the politics of the Nazi beasts from so long ago.

'Only after intense discussion did my son acknowledge that, in principle, the newspaper articles are correct,' he said with a sad shake of his head.

According to police sources the Sieg Heiling! and Heil Hitlers! Went far beyond mere larking about. 

One officer said: 'They spoke about being "pure Ayran folk", which is something straight out of the Nazi lexicon, and said they wanted to work towards building a Fourth Reich.'

School insiders say the writing has been on the wall for years. 

East Germany in general remains blighted by higher unemployment and lower opportunities than the rest of the country - a fertile breeding ground for far-right parties like the NPD which has been trawling outside the school gates in recent years to sign up youngsters to their twisted cause.

And one told MailOnline that in a mock classroom ballot earlier this year, meant to emulate the European Parliament elections, a 'worryingly high' number of 9a pupils voted for the NPD - a party that wants to kick out all foreigners from Germany and promote the kind of 'folk superiority' that the original Nazis did all those years ago.

Sachsen-Anhalt, the state in which Landsberg lies, has had a neo-Nazi problem for years. The state elections in 2011 saw close to 50,000 people voting for the NPD which only narrowly failed to enter parliament.

Media commentators say the police and government authorities have not done enough to combat right-wing extremism, which has festered especially in depopulated rural regions of the east where neo-Nazis sit on town councils, organize local sports festivals and youth activities and are even trying to staff kindergartens.

Lutz Feudel, the director of the Landsberg school, is said by friends to be 'devastated' by the antics of class 9A.

'Now everything is on the table and we must find out who wrote what, who photographed what, who uploaded what and so on,' said Herr Feudel.

But he said he did not want to instantly accuse the children, adding: 'Breaking taboos is part of young adulthood. I don't believe that they wanted to actively promote neo-Nazi ideology.'

Prosecutor Andreas Schieweck, 59, has confirmed that they are investigating allegations of glorifying the crimes of the Third Reich and that an investigation was currently underway into at least four pupils in the class. 

Germany regards any glorification of the Third Reich including the use of Hitler salutes as illegal and punishable by jail terms, though in this case the age of the pupils is also expected to be taken into account.  

After intense pressure from parents and the school, the children of class 9A issued an apology on Facebook for their actions.

They said: 'We, as class 9a from the Landsberg Grammar School, apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage, and that which is still to come. These were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for.

'Furthermore, it was not the whole class which was responsible. That's why we would like to apologize, even to our uninvolved classmates.'

They accused the BILD newspaper in Germany, which broke the story, of 'twisting' facts 'but want to apologise for these anyway, even if they were not meant seriously. And we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again.' 

It was signed on behalf of 'all those responsible'.

But the reasons for the allure of history's most murderous regime remain, so far, unexplained.
