The PM, pictured today in New York, has announced Parliament is to be recalled for an emergency vote on Britain joining airstrikes in Iraq

David Cameron tonight announced Parliament is to be recalled on Friday for an emergency vote on Britain joining airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.

The Prime Minister is in New York where he today held historic talks with the Iranian President to build a global alliance aimed at driving the murderous militants out of Iraq.

MPs have been summoned to Westminster to endorse sending the RAF to join the effort in finding and destroying ISIS bases as soon as Saturday.

But ministers are at pains to stress the move will not involve British boots on the ground.  

Mr Cameron hopes to secure cross-party backing for military involvement in Iraq, more than a decade after Tony Blair’s deeply unpopular invasion to topple Saddam Hussein.

Downing Street stresses there are no plans to have boots on the ground, and the decision comes after a formal request for help from the Iraqi government.

The move tonight comes after growing pressure on Mr Cameron to act against ISIS which has beheaded three Western hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning.

However Mr Henning's brother-in-law Colin Livesey last night appealed for air strikes to be called off, arguing that the raids would reduce the chance of him being released alive. 

In a statement Mr Cameron tonight said: 'I have requested that Parliament be recalled to debate the UK response to the Iraqi government's request for support against Isil.

'The Speaker has accepted my request to recall Parliament on Friday.'

Mr Cameron has stressed that the British government will not act without the request of the Iraqi government.

There are no plans to carry out air strikes in Syria, where no agreement has been reached with the Assad regime.  

Mr Cameron was humiliated a year ago when he lost a Commons vote on military action to support rebels seeking to overthrow Assad.

Number 10 has deliberately taken its time in building consensus on military action.

Mr Cameron will open the debate on Friday morning, and his deputy Lib Dem Nick Clegg will close it before the vote.

Tonight Mr Clegg said: 'When this issue is debated and voted on in parliament on Friday, the Liberal Democrats will support the airstrikes in Iraq for the following reasons: firstly because it is legal, it’s been requested by the Iraqi government to help them rid themselves of the threat of ISIL.

'Secondly it’s part of a much bigger coalition, a whole array of countries crucially including a number of Arab countries which deprives ISIL of the ability to somehow portray it as a West versus the rest crusade.

Nick Clegg said the Liberal Democrats will support military intervention 

'Thirdly it will not now nor in the future involve British combat forces on the ground.

'And fourthly because the decision will only be taken after a debate and a vote in the House of Commons, not just by the Government – on behalf of the country as a whole.

'I think there are many people across the country who see what this medieval murderous organisation does, slaughtering people regardless of their ethnicity or their religion; an organisation which is actively plotting to do us harm in this country.

'I think most people across the country want the British Government to play our part in ridding the world of this vile threat.'

Mr Cameron is expected to chair a meeting of the Cabinet tomorrow at 1pm.

Labour leader Ed Miliband convened a meeting of his shadow cabinet at his party conference in Manchester to agree its position.

He said: 'We cannot turn away from the threat of ISIL which is a murderous organisation, has taken British hostages, threatens the stability of the region and is therefore a threat to the UK's national interest.

'That is why we will be supporting the Government's proposal for UK airstrikes in Iraq against ISIL.

'I want to reassure people there is no question of committing UK ground troops. There is an alliance which includes countries in the region.

'We will learn the lessons of the past - but we will not turn away from threats to our national interest.' 

Iraqi Premier Haider Abadi made the formal request for help in a meeting with Mr Cameron this afternoon, giving him the legal cover he believes is needed to go ahead. 

Interviewed last night on NBC News, Mr Cameron said the IS group posed a direct threat to Britain.

'These people want to kill us,' he said. They've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.' 

Britain has six RAF Tornado fighter-bombers based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus armed with fearsome Brimstone missiles and Paveway IV bombs which can fly within minutes.  

More than 130 jihadists were killed in Monday's US-led attacks focused on the ISIL stronghold of Raqqa in Syria.

The decision to return to military action in Iraq comes three years after troops British troops left the war-torn country.

Mr Cameron - who is desperate to avoid a repeat of last year's damaging Commons defeat over air strikes against Syria - said he was confident he would get the support of the House "on an all-party basis".

'What we are doing is legal, it is right, it does not involve British troops on the ground,' he said.

'As ever with our country, when we are threatened in this way we should not turn away from what needs to be done.'

A separate debate and vote would need to be held before any action was taken in Syria. 

Earlier Mr Cameron held an extraordinary meeting with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani to seek help in defeating ISIS militants. 

The PM declared ’a little bit of history made’ after emerging from the first face-to-face talks for 35 years between the leaders of the two countries which have been at loggerheads over Tehran's nuclear policy.

Mr Cameron has made clear that a global alliance is needed to tackle the rise of ISIS.

As the talks got underway, Mr Rouhani tweeted a photograph with a message urging 'constructive engagement'.

In a major development, the US told Iran of its plans to strike ISIS militants inside Syria in order to reassure them that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be targetted.

The communication appears to signal a cooling in hostilities between the US and Iran for the first time since a 1979 hostage crisis prompted Washington to sever ties with Tehran.

Iran is said to have voiced concerns for the safety of Assad, who remains the Shia Islam-dominated nation's closest regional ally and the recipient of Iranian military support during a Syrian Civil War. 

Mr Cameron will use a speech to the UN General Assembly tonight to set out his reasons for joining a coalition of more than 40 nations, including the US, France and Arab states.

He will echo US president Barack Obama’s call for the world to come together to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and ’dismantle this network of death’.

Speaking to the General Assembly this afternoon, Mr Obama said that ISIS understood only 'the language of force' and called on those who have joined up to fight with the group to ’leave the battlefield while they can’.

The president condemned atrocities against women and religious minorities in ISIS-controlled areas and described the beheading of hostages including British aid worker David Haines as ’the most horrific crimes imaginable’

He added: 'No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions.

'There can be no reasoning - no negotiation - with this brand of evil.'

He added: 'The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.'

Mr Obama said the US would not send troops to ’occupy foreign lands’, but will 'support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities'.

He added: 'Today, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined Isil should leave the battlefield while they can.

'Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats; and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build - not those who destroy.'
