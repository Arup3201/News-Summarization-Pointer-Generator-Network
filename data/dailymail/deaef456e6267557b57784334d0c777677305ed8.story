Young women are being held back by the belief they should put their children before their own ambitions, a leading headmistress warns today.

Girls are still being brought up to believe that raising a family is more important than pursuing their personal goals, according to Hilary French.

She said schoolgirls needed to learn they were free to make their own decisions about how to balance their careers with bringing up a child.

Mrs French, the new president of the Girls’ Schools Association, criticised the continuing assumption that women should be responsible for childcare.

This was despite the emergence of a generation of ‘very caring’ young men who have an affinity with children.

Young women are also going to university in greater numbers than men and achieving more than ever in the workplace.

In her first interview as president, Mrs French told how pupils at her all-girls school - £10,750-a-year Central Newcastle High - were shocked by a talk from a female entrepreneur who told them she put her career before her child.

Mrs French said she regularly runs a course for pupils which covers entrepreneurial and leadership skills and features outside speakers.

‘Eighteen months ago, one of the young entrepreneurs, a lady, dared to say that she had probably put her business ahead of her son, and the sharp intake of breath from all of the girls was audible,’ she said.

‘They were all absolutely shocked, so yes, we are still creating a generation of girls who think that the whole idea of looking after children is really the most important thing, once you have a child.

‘And who’s to say? That’s a whole ethical, moral argument. And it’s a very, very personal decision.

‘But, what’s maybe less personal, and maybe more incumbent on us as leaders in girls’ schools, is to try and get girls to see that it is a decision, and that there are options, and that it’s not wrong, and that’s where society needs to come into play as well.

‘It’s not wrong to make a particular decision, whatever it is.’

Mrs French said it was the responsibility of girls’ schools to help their pupils to ‘be strong in making decisions, and secure in the rightness of the decision that they have made’.

She added there was ‘probably still the assumption’ that women will deal with childcare.

‘There has been an increase in the number of house-husbands, but the very fact that it is still newsworthy means it’s not accepted as the norm,’ she told the Press Association.

‘I think there’s a long way to go before there’s total equality in that area.’

She said it was now well-known that girls were going to university in increasing numbers.

But Mrs French added: ‘We do still expect women to be at the core of the relationship, the homemaker, the person who brings up children and thinks about what everyone’s going to eat every day. It’s still, I think, unusual to find a man doing that.’

Men are largely still seen as the parent who will go out to work to support the family, she said.

But she was ‘quite struck’ that young men nowadays are ‘very caring and do want to have children and do have an affinity with children.’

In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs French also urged girls to develop ‘soft skills’ as well as clocking up exam passes.

‘Yes, you need your exam results, you need your degree, but it’s a passport for opening a door, getting through a door, and then when you are actually working, there’s so many other things out there in society that you need, which is why it’s so good that girls’ schools, really good schools, and universities do so much more than teach the subjects, teach facts.

‘It’s so much more than sitting in front of a computer, it’s developing all of those other skills.’

And she raised concerns that Government plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with more rigorous exams may ‘make a failing system more complicated and possibly more prone to absolute collapse in the end’.

She said the Coalition was right ‘to make the system more rigorous and fit for purpose’ but argued the planned new exams would ‘not suit a huge proportion of children’.
