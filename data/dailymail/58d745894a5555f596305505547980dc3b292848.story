The wife of North Korea's Kim Jong-Un is a former singer who has visited South Korea and caught the leader's eye while she was giving a performance, it was revealed today.

Official media in the secretive state revealed last night that a stylish young woman pictured accompanying Kim this month is his wife, Ri Sol-Ju.

It gave no details about her and did not say when they wed. But the mere fact that the couple were presented in public marked a new departure for the nation's dynastic leadership.

The world has been scrambling for 
information about Kim Jong-Un since he took over the impoverished but 
nuclear-armed state after his father Kim Jong-Il died suddenly last 
December.

He is believed to be in his late 20s but even his exact age is unknown outside the North.

In public, Kim Jong-Un has presented a
relaxed and confident image in an apparent attempt to emphasise his 
readiness to rule despite his youth and inexperience.

The disclosure of the marriage was seen as part of the process.

While Kim Jong-Il's wives were never 
pictured at official functions, 'the regime is now facing a different 
situation, and the move is part of work to make Kim Jong-Un appear old 
and wise enough to rule', said Seoul-based online newspaper the Daily 
NK.

The aim is partly to show 'he is not a
child', said Chang Yong-Suk, of the Institute for Peace and Unification
Studies at Seoul National University.

South Korean media generally agreed 
that the short-haired and smiling woman, apparently in her twenties, is a
former songstress who was specially trained to become Kim's consort.

Yonhap news agency said she could be 
seen singing on video footage of a performance released by the North in 
February last year. Ri had taken a six-month course in the duties of a 
first lady, it said.

Chosun Ilbo newspaper said Ri was 
active in the North's Unhasu orchestra until last year and performed for
Kim and his father on New Year's Eve 2010.

'There is a possibility Jong-Un chose her as his wife after seeing her at the concert hall,' it quoted a source as saying.

Another source told the paper that 
after the marriage Ri had undergone a six-month course in duties of a 
first lady at Kim Il-Sung University.

JoongAng Ilbo also described Ri as a 
former singer who came to the young Kim's notice during a performance. 
It said Kim's father had singled her out as first lady while working on 
his succession plan.

The Kim Il-Sung University graduate is
from the northeastern province of North Hamkyong and her father is an 
academic and mother a doctor, the paper said.

Dong-A Ilbo gave similar details about
her background. But in a report which contradicted other accounts, it 
said the couple married in 2009 and had a child the following year.

The International Crisis Group 
think-tank said in a report this week that Kim appears fully in charge, 
despite speculation he would rely on close advisers because of his youth
and inexperience.

But it said there was nothing to 
suggest he would take measures to improve the lot of his people amid 
severe food shortages, or reduce regional frictions over the North's 
nuclear and missile programmes.

The U.S. took the opportunity to reiterate concerns about the plight of North Koreans under the Kim dynasty.

'We would always wish any kind of 
newlyweds well as they embark' on married life, said State Department 
spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.

'But obviously our concerns first and 
foremost are for the North Korean people, and our hope that conditions 
for them will improve.'

Yonhap speculated that Ri could have 
visited South Korea, saying a 17-year-old student named Ri Sol-Ju was 
part of a delegation to the Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon in 
September 2005.

The student performed a duet during the event, it said.
