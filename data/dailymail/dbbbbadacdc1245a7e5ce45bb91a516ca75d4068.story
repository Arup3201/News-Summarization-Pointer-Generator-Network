A Chinese firework factory is reduced to little more than a pile of bricks after a devastating explosion tore through the building on Friday.

Eleven female workers were killed and 17 injured as they assembled fuses for firecrackers at their workstations in the plant in the city of Cenxi in the Guangxi autonomous region.

The blast, which occurred on Friday, was so powerful that it shook nearby buildings and blew out windows while the sound echoed for miles across the city.

When the dust settled, all that was left of the factory were mounds concrete bricks and the red remains of firecracker cartridges strewn about the blast site.

The cause was not immediately clear, Xinhua said.

A man reached at the Guangxi Work Safety Bureau said that two factory executives were detained. He gave no other details.

The man only gave his last name as Chen, which is common among China's bureaucrats when speaking to the press.

Concerns: Workplace safety is a major problem in China where enforcement of laws is lax with factories themselves usually left to decide whether to follow them

Cenxi is about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Beijing.

Workplace safety is a major problem in China where enforcement of laws is lax with factories themselves usually left to decide whether to follow them.
