Islamic State jihadis today issued a clear threat to the heart of Christianity, as they published an image of their black flag flying above the Vatican.

In a picture on the cover of their official magazine showing a mock-up of Caliphate-controlled Rome, the militants’ flag is superimposed on the obelisk in St Peter’s Square.

It is the front cover of the fourth edition of the ISIS online propaganda magazine Dabiq, which calls in its latest issue for a war against the Catholic Church.

While the headline reads The Failed Crusade, the article threatens to ‘conquer’ Rome and ‘break your crosses’.

The article in Dabiq - named after a town in northern Syria where in 1516 the Ottomans defeated the Mamluks, establishing the last Islamic caliphate - also urged faithful Muslims to attack and kill ‘every Crusader possible’.

It added that ‘it is lawful to kidnap the women of the infidels and use them as sex slaves’.

Last month, security officials said that they had stepped up security at the Vatican following threats by ISIS, including restricting air space above Vatican City.

Italy’s most notorious jihadi recruiter Bosnian imam Bilal Bosnic, who has admitted conscripting young European Muslim converts to fight with ISIS, said that the extremist militants will bring Islam even to the heart of Christendom, even if he does not live to see it.

He said: ‘In time the whole world will be an Islamic state. Our goal is to make sure that even the Vatican will be Muslim.’

Pope Francis was reported to be ‘in the crosshairs’ of ISIS, because he was the leading proponent of false truths, according to intelligence sources.
