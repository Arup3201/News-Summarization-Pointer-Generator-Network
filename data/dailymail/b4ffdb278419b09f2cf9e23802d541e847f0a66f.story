Canal lovers: Timothy West and Prunella Scales embark on boat trips together which keeps life calm

She admitted last year that she struggled with her day-to-day memory and could not remember whether she had made herself a coffee.

Yesterday it emerged actress Prunella Scales has been diagnosed with ‘mild Alzheimer’s’.

And the 81-year-old star, who is best-known for playing bolshie wife Sybil in Fawlty Towers, remained typically defiant over her diagnosis declaring it would not stop her from acting and that she hoped to die on stage ‘playing a reasonably good part’ during her ‘eighth curtain call’.

Filming a series for More 4 documentaries with actor husband Timothy West, in which the couple embark on canal boat trips together, the pair opened up about how their lives have changed following Miss Scales’ diagnosis.

Actor Mr West, 79, told how his beloved wife struggles to ‘remember things’ but admitted their canal boat lifestyle therefore allowed her ‘enjoy things as they happen’.

Living life day-by-day with her doting husband, Miss Scales said in an interview with the Radio Times: ‘I always say I want to die on the eighth curtain call. Eight will mean the show’s been rather a success. I just hope I’m somewhere near the middle and have been reasonably good in the part.’

Speaking about their programme ‘Grand Canal Journeys’ which will see the couple tour four of Britain’s favourite canal journeys, Mr West admitted life on the boat helped cope him cope with his wife’s difficulties.

Describing her condition as ‘a sort of mild Alzheimer’s’ in an interview with the Radio Times Mr West, said: ‘She can’t remember things very well, but you don’t have to remember things on the canal.

‘You can just enjoy things as they happen - so it’s perfect for her.’

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, and currently there is no cure for the disease which worsens as it progresses.

Although Alzheimer’s disease develops differently for every individual, there are many common symptoms which include short term memory loss, confusion, irritability, mood swings, trouble with language and long term memory loss.

Though she struggles to remember if she has made her morning coffee, Mr West says, they are coping fine

Many early symptoms go undetected and are often mistakenly thought to be ‘age-related’ concerns or manifestations of stress.

Miss Scales and Mr West have been navigating Britain’s canals on a slow boat ever since they sparked a passion for the hobby when they borrowed a friend’s boat for a fortnight in the 1970s.

The devoted couple, who have two sons, celebrated their golden wedding anniversary last October with a trip down the River Thames on paddle steamer the Waverley.

Speaking about her love of boats Miss Scales added: ‘It’s always Tim who steers. But I enjoy running up and down because of the wonderful wildlife on the towpath. And it keeps you fit.’

In January last Miss Scales revealed to the Daily Mail her short-term memory was fading to the point she could not remember whether she had made herself a coffee.

She said she struggled to remember the year either of her two sons were born, nor when she married Mr West.

She said: ‘My day-to-day memory is ludicrous, I can’t remember things about life, so you find ways of remembering by writing them down. What was I looking up?

‘I don’t know my alphabet, that’s my problem.

‘Inside I feel about 48.’

The actress, CBE, was BAFTA award-nominated in 1991 for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in A Question of Attribution by Alan Bennett.

She was famously close friends with the late actor Richard Briers who she supported while he battled emphysema.

The actress, who lives in South-West London, stared in the sixties sitcom ‘Marriage Lines’ alongside Mr Briers, playing newlyweds George and Kate Starling.

Speaking about Miss Scales’ diagnosis, Dr Alison Cook of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘The Alzheimer’s Society would like to thank Timothy West for speaking out about his wife Prunella Scales’ dementia and raising awareness of the condition. 

'Their recent adventure navigating Britain’s canals shows that it is possible to live well with dementia and plan to carry on enjoying life. 

'We would urge anyone who is concerned about themselves or a loved one to speak to their GP today or contact Alzheimer’s Society for advice and support.’
