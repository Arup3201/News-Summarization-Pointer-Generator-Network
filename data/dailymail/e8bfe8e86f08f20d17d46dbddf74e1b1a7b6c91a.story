Cristiano Ronaldo made it 400 career goals in just 652 games, as Real Madrid beat Celta Vigo 3-0 to close the gap on leaders Barcelona.

Ronaldo was out of sorts for most of Real’s first game of the year but still arrived twice in the six-yard box to finish off crosses from full back Dani Carvajal and then Gareth Bale, who came on as a second half substitute.

For a player whose finishing was seen as his weakness as a young winger at Sporting the 28-year-old’s achievement is an incredible one. His double took him to 29 goals so far this season in 22 games and it gets him off the mark for 2014 after closing 2013 on 69 goals for the calendar year.

The brace also carried him past Hugo 
Sanchez as the fourth highest scorer in Real Madrid’s history – not a 
bad way to count down the days to next week’s Ballon d’Or gala.

'The goals were for Eusebio,' said the player after the game. 'I am grateful to Spain for the way they paid homage to him.'

After
 the pre-match minute's silence for Eusebio it was Celta Vigo who had 
the best chance of the first half. Striker Charles shot wide after 
being  put through by Augusto Fernandez.

Borja
 Oubiña also went close as the team bossed by Luis Enrique, the former 
Roma coach linked with the Tottenham job last month, started brightly. And with on-loan 
Barcelona midfielder Rafinha controlling the game in midfield Real 
struggled to make headway.

Luka
 Modric was their best player in a poor first half and came closest to 
scoring for the home side with a shot from distance that just cleared 
Yoel’s bar.

Xabi Alonso, currently playing with a burst eardrum, 
did not reappear for the second half with Asier Illaramendi coming on 
for the Spain midfielder, who is now in the last six months of his 
contract and is free to negotiate a move away from the Bernabeu.

Celta
 continued to threaten and Charles missed his second clear-cut chance of
 the game. This time it was Rafinha who put him through but his 
first-time shot went well wide of Diego Lopez’ goal.

The
 visitors were always going to pay for their misses and when Bale and 
20-year-old forward Jese came on midway through the second half Madrid 
moved up into another gear. Jese might have scored with his first touch 
but saw his low shot smothered by Yoel.

But
 moments later he crossed cleverly for Karim Benzema who gave Real 
Madrid the lead. That was the cue for Ronaldo to join the New Year’s 
party.

He tapped-in 
Carvajal’s cross from the right and then turned in Bale’s assist after 
the Welshman darted to the byline and pulled the ball back for Ronaldo 
to score.

Most expect him to
 be crowned Fifa World Player of the Year next week at the Ballon d’Or 
Gala in Zurich. He will attend Monday’s presentation of the award and 
does so having scored the 400th goal of his career.

Confirming his attendance, Ronaldo said: 'The matter is closed and I don’t want to talk about it any more, I just want to say that I’m going to the Gala.

'I don’t know if it’s fair or not if I, Ribery or Messi win. I just try to do my job like I always do, to help Real Madrid by scoring goals and put in good performances. If I win, great and if not, life goes on and I’ll continue to keep doing what I’ve always done.'

End of the matter: Ronaldo has confirmed he will be attending the Ballon d'Or Gala on Monday

Madrid
 coach Carlo Ancelotti said after the game: 'We switched to  4-4-2 in the latter 
stages. Ronaldo prefers to play on the wing but he switched to the 
middle and managed to score from his two chances.'

Meanwhile, Celta's Luis Enrique lamented: 'What
 do we need to do to climb the table?

'See that rectangular thing? And that round thing? Hit the round thing 
into the rectangular thing.'

300. Granada 1 Real Madrid 2 - May 5 2012

Having gone behind to a fifth-minute goal against Granada, Madrid came back in emphatic fashion which kept Jose Mourinho's side on course to break the 100 point barrier. Ronaldo finally found the breakthrough with 10 minutes to go before the unfortunate David Cortes put into his own net in injury time to hand the Spanish giants all three points.
