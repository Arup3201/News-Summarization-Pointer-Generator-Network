These are the touching images of a woman who has formed a remarkable bond with a kangaroo.

Julia Heckathorn, 28, from Virginia in the United States, adopted two-year-old Boomeroo from a farm in Texas when she was just 3 weeks old and the pair have been inseparable ever since.

Boomeroo - who wears human clothing - lets out an excited squeak every time Mrs Heckathorn walks into a room, and often stretches her arms out for cuddles and follows her around the house.

Touching: Julia Heckathorn has formed a remarkable bond with Boomeroo the kangaroo. She adopted her from a farm in Texas when she was just 3 weeks old and the pair have been inseparable ever since

Close: Boomeroo - who wears human clothing - lets out an excited squeak every time Julia Heckathorn walks into a room. The children's author (left) says her pet kangaroo also often stretches her arms out for cuddles

Friends: Although Boomeroo sleeps in an outdoor barn each night, she spends her days hopping around the house with Larry the cat (left) and staring out of windows (right, with a sugar glider possum on her back)

Mrs Heckathorn is a children's author and takes Boomeroo with her whenever she visits a school in the hope of teaching them more about nature.

She says Boomeroo loves to wear human clothes and even has her own wardrobe full of tops and dresses that have been specifically purchased from baby stores for her.

When she was a joey, Boomeroo slept in the house Mrs Heckathorn shares with her husband Jason.

But as she grew too big to spend all her time indoors, the couple built a temperature controlled barn in their garden where Boomeroo can sleep alongside the couple's other animals - an anteater called Noche, four 
sugar glider possums, and a cat called Larry.  

Dressed up: Boomeroo apparently loves to wear human clothes and even has her own wardrobe full of tops and dresses that have been specifically purchased from baby stores for her

Never apart: Boomeroo and Larry the cat are the best of friends, according to Julia Heckathorn. 'They eat grass together, lay together, and watch the birds together. It's adorable,' she says

Education: Julia Heckathorn is a children's author and takes a formally-dressed Boomeroo with her whenever she visits a school in the hope of teaching the pupils more about nature

Cute: When she was a joey (pictured), Boomeroo slept in the house Mrs Heckathorn shares with her husband Jason. But as she grew too big to spend all her time indoors, the couple built a temperature controlled barn

Although Boomeroo sleeps in the barn each night, she spends her days hopping around the house and garden with Larry, staring out the window, and sleeping at Mrs Heckathorn's feet while she writes.

'When Boomeroo was younger I used to carry her around in a bag with me to the supermarket so she could get used to seeing people,' she said.

'To her I'm her mum and she follows me everywhere. When she sees me near she makes this little sound, like an excited chortle, just as kangaroos would do in the wild to locate their mum,' Mrs Heckathorn added.

Family: When she was a joey, Boomeroo slept in the house Mrs Heckathorn shares with her husband Jason

Watching the world go by: Kangaroos are social animals, living in groups called mobs, so when Boomeroo was a joey, Mr and Mrs Heckathorn adopted Larry the cat to give her 24-hour companionship

Mrs Heckathorn's says that when she visits a school with one of her unusual animals, the childrens' eyes 'light up with excitement' and they become far more interested in learning about conservation

Describing the kangaroo's love of human 
attire, she said: 'When we first got Boomeroo, she was wearing a little 
shirt and she's worn clothes ever since. The clothes give her comfort as
 a thunder shirt would give comfort to a dog.'

'She loves her tops, and when I have 
to take her top off to clean it, she puts her arms out and waits for me 
to dress her again,' Mrs Heckathorn went on to day.

Feeding: The Heckathorns' plans for another unusual animal have been put on hold this year as the couple are expecting their first child - a daughter

Curled up: The couple say they hope their new daughter will become firm friends with the animals

Busy: Although Boomeroo sleeps in the barn each night, she spends her days hopping around the house and garden with Larry, staring out the window, and sleeping at Mrs Heckathorn's feet while she writes

Talking about the animals' unorthodox friendship, she said: 'Boomeroo
 and Larry get on really well, and the two are now the best of friends, 
doing everything together. They eat grass together, lay together, and 
watch the birds together. It's adorable.'

But plans for another animal have been put on hold this year as the couple are expecting their first child - a daughter.

Mrs Heckathorn said: 'We are so excited to be expecting our first child, and I'm sure 
that she and the animals will be the best of friends. She will be a very
 lucky girl with wonderful experiences.'
