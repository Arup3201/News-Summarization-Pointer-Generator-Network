A Canadian teacher may have been cleared in a sexual assault case involving an ex-student, but her troubles are far from over as she looks to recover from a case that has cost her a job and her reputation.

Mary Gowans, 43, of Toronto, had been accused of engaging in 'heavy petting' and make-out sessions with a former student whom she allegedly favoured while he was one of her eighth grade French students.

The boy, now 18, testified that many of their encounters occurred while he was babysitting her five and nine-year-old children in 2009 and 2010.

Cleared: Mary Gowans had been accused of engaging in 'heavy petting' and make-out sessions with a former student whom she allegedly favoured while he was one of her eighth grade French students

But a judge ruled on Friday that her alleged victim's inconsistent account of their sexual relationship caused the prosecution's case to collapse.

She was found not guilty, but was rebuked by Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon for getting too close to a student.

'I would have thought that her 17 years of teaching experience, she would have realized... he’s spending a lot of time in her life. Alarm bells should have gone off,' McMahon said, according to the Toronto Star.

Appearing with her attorney outside the courthouse, Gowans said that she will now focus on fixing the mess her life has become since the allegations ruined her teaching career and her marriage.

She said: ‘Obviously I’m very glad 
this is over today. It has been a very very difficult week, and the last
three years of my life have unfortunately been destroyed as a result of
these allegations.

Gowans
added: 'And I’m glad it's over but at the same time I have the task of 
rebuilding my life now. I just want to thank everybody for their support
- my family and my friends - and just let everybody know I didn’t do 
anything wrong. I’m glad this is done.'

Moving on: Gowans, pictured outside court on Friday, was found not guilty - but was rebuked by Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon for getting too close to a student

The victim, who was not identified, had told the court that he couldn’t have been making up the affair with Gowans because he knows she had breast implants and other intimate details about the 42-year-old mother.

Gowans denied they had ever had an affair and claimed the teenager, now 18, had kissed her and grabbed her crotch in January 2010, after he had graduated from Joseph Howe Sr. Public School.

Defense lawyers painted the 
18-year-old as a bright but arrogant teen who became ‘obsessed’ with his
teacher, who has since lost her job and separated from her husband of 
17 years.

After the judge's verdict came down, the victim’s family told the Toronto Star that they believe the teacher was lying.

In court: She added that she took him home immediately and said he could not return to the house again

The teen’s mother told the paper: 'We're disappointed with the verdict but we believe our son, and Ms Gowans can live with her lies.'

During her testimony, Gowans recounted how her son and daughter were playing hide-and-seek at the home when she leaned in to the teen to reveal where her son was hiding.

But to her surprise, he kissed her on the lips and grabbed her crotch, she said.

'It took a second to realize what was going on. Then, I pushed him back and said, "What are you doing? Stop!"' she said, according to the Toronto Sun.

'He looked a little shocked and I was 
extremely shocked. This was right out of the blue for me. I had 
absolutely no idea this was coming. I felt he had taken advantage of my 
kindness.'

Accusations: The teenager, now 18, told the court they had at least four sexual encounters after his teacher took a liking to him. He admitted he had had sexual fantasies about her

In the dock: Gowans said he had become a member of the family and they regularly exchanged texts

She said she gathered herself and then told her children they were driving the boy home. The next day, after coaching the boy in hockey practice, she told him he would never return to her home.

'It never occurred to me to report him to the police. I thought the consequences like that didn’t seem fitting,' she said.

'My children loved him and it was hurtful when I heard (his testimony that) he didn’t care for them,' said Gowans.

'I considered him like a member of our family.'

They sent text messages to each other in the week afterwards and he repeatedly apologised and said he was worried she would tell his parents, she said.

A communications company testified last week that Gowans and the boy exchanged 2,218 text messages over a year beginning in February 2009.

A few days later, police knocked on her door and she was arrested in front of her children.
