Archaeologists have literally walked through history after discovering Britain’s oldest pavement.

The unique stone pathway was built more than 4,000 years ago and is the only one of its kind in the UK.

Experts at the site claim the 4ft wide stone walkway - known as a ‘crystal causeway’ or ‘processional pathway’ - originally linked two ceremonial circles.

A team from Cornwall’s Historic Environment department has spent the past week at the Hurlers stone circles site near Minions on Bodmin Moor.

The wider significance and exact date of the enigmatic structure will only be known after tests are carried out on material taken from beneath.

Dig director James Gossip said several clues to the Bronze Age people who built it have been found including two flint tools.

A team from Cornwall's Historic Environment department has spent the past week at the Hurlers stone circles near Minions carefully uncovering a monument believed to be the only one of its kind in the British Isles

He said: ‘What they will be looking for is evidence of burnt material, such as seeds, sealed beneath the pavement.

‘This will be radio carbon dated to give a pretty accurate time of its construction and help to verify our assumption that this is a 4,000-year-old structure contemporary with the circles.’

The dig was part of a wider Heritage Lottery-funded project called Mapping The Sun, organised by Caradon Hill Area Heritage Project.

Lead archaeologist Jacky Nowakowski said: ‘We have already found two prehistoric flint tools in amongst the stones.

‘This has given us a great deal of confidence about how well preserved it is and also the fact that it is related to the two circles on either side.

‘We still don’t know exactly what it is, but by carrying out this work we may discover more about this extremely enigmatic site.’

The project’s findings are due to be published in a report by the end of the year.
