Tiger Woods fell to the ground in extreme pain Sunday on the 13th hole of the The Barclays due to ‘sleeping in hotels,’ ruining his chances at a win.

It was the final round at Liberty National course in New Jersey and Woods had nearly fought his way into the lead when a severe back spasm left him reeling.

The disastrous swing, which put his ball in a water hazard, caused Woods to bogey the hole and eventually fall shot short of the lead.

Grounded: Tiger Woods was within striking distance of the lead during the final round of The Barclays on Sunday when a crippling back spasm brought him to his knees

For a moment after taking the wild shot, onlookers and announcers suspected Woods wouldn’t even make it through the rest of the tournament.

‘When it goes into a spasm that bad,’ said one announcer, who moaned in sympathy right along with Woods, ‘there’s no way to recuperate.’

Woods remained on his knees, clutching his five wood for support, for several moments before finally rising back to his feet.

‘I don’t think I’ve seen a guy go down from back spasms on a golf swing in a long time,’ the announcer said.

But Woods fought through the pain long enough to trudge off the fairway to the supportive applause of nearby spectators before finally finishing the hole.

On Wednesday, Woods first reported his continuing back problem and blamed his overly soft bed.

‘It was stiff this morning after a soft bed,’ he told reporters. ‘Just one of those things, sleeping in hotels and I didn't want to push it, so just took it easy.’

On the final day of The Barclays, it looked as if he didn’t take it easy enough.

Nonetheless, he would go on to birdie on holes 16 and 17 and come within an inch of a birdie putt on 18.

Woods said he had little time to anticipate the injury.

‘I felt great until that tee shot at 12,’ Woods told ESPN. ‘I was perfectly fine.’

Painful: He continued to grimace as he slowly stood
