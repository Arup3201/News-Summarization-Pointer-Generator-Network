Stephen Colbert said during his first visit to the Late Show since it was announced that he was going to be the successor to David Letterman that he's obviously 'thrilled' to be succeeding the CBS funnyman - he also told his soon-to-be predecessor a story about how he'd once turned down an internship on Letterman's show.

The Comedy Central host told Letterman on the Late Show on Tuesday that he's going to do whatever Letterman has done.

Letterman urges against it, saying, 'You don't want to do that.'

Letterman greeted Colbert warmly and offered an endorsement, saying CBS 'could have just as easily hired another boob' like him.

Colbert responded by telling his soon-to-be predecessor that 'Every boob is like a snowflake, Dave.'

Then the Colbert Report host told Letterman a story about how he had accompanied his college girlfriend to an interview for an internship on Letterman's old show, Late Night.

As he was waiting in the hall, a Late Night staffer asked him if he was going to be interviewing for the internship. Colbert says he told the staffer no, but he was talked into interviewing anyway.

Colbert got the internship. His girlfriend didn't, which, he says, was a factor in their eventual breakup.

Colbert turned down the internship, which prompted Letterman to ask why.

'Because you did not pay people. It is an expensive city,' Colbert 
said. 'Dave I have to ask, the next job I'm taking here, it pays? 
Because I already signed the papers.'

Colbert also talked about how he and his writing partner had submitted some of their work to The Late Show in 1997, including the Top 10 List titled 'Top 10 cocktails for Santa.'

The list includes drinks like the 'Jack Frost: Equal parts Jack Daniels and snow (seasonal),' and the 'No room at the Gin: Chill martini glass, fill with gin until there is no room for anything else.'

Colbert takes over for Letterman when he retires next year.

Colbert, 49, has been hosting The Colbert Report since 2005, in character as a fictional conservative talk-show host. The character will retire with 'The Colbert Report.

'Simply being a guest on David Letterman's show has been a highlight of my career,' Colbert said when it was announced he would take over as the host of the Late Show. 'I never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Dave's lead.'

Boobs: Colbert joked with Letterman after they each referred to themselves as 'boobs' that 'each boob is like a snowflake, Dave'

Retirement: Letterman has hosted the Late Show since 1993 and plans to retire next year

Letterman, who turns 67 on Saturday, announced on his show earlier this month that he would retire sometime in 2015, although he hasn't set a date. CBS said at the time that creative elements of Colbert's new show, including where it will be based, will be announced later.

Letterman offered his endorsement for Colbert's selection saying, 'Stephen has always been a real friend to me. I'm very excited for him, and I'm flattered that CBS chose him. I also happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses.'
