If you have skydived and bungee-jumped from the highest bridges but still yearn for excitement, a holiday based on dangerous driving may be right up your street.

One company is now offering car fanatics the chance to take on the world’s most dangerous roads in an adrenalin-fuelled two-day break, which it warns is not for those of a ‘nervous disposition’.

A holiday-maker could choose to drive a Bugatti Veyron down the ‘Highway to Hell’ in the U.S. or negotiate Russia’s freezing winters and treacherous dirt roads on the Siberian Highway in a trusty Toyota Corolla – but the adventure has a hefty price tag.

For £200,000 you could drive a Bugatti Veyron down the 'Highway to Hell' in the U.S. try the terrifying Naga Parbat Pass in Pakistan (pictured) or negotiate Russia's freezing winters and treacherous dirt roads on the Siberian Highway in a trusty Toyota Corolla or a sleek supercar

The holiday lasts for two days and costs around £200,000.

It is being offered by buyagift.com in response to demand from people who read MailOnline's feature about the world's 22 most dangerous roads.

The tracks include the 'Highway to Hell' in the U.S. and the Siberian Highway in Russia.

Drivers can choose a car to drive on their chosen journey, including a  trusty Toyota Corolla or a Bugatti Veyron.

On the first day the driver will meet their instructor and see the track, before having some training.

On the second day they take on the course themselves - along with an instructor - in a dual-controlled car of their choice.

The two day adventure includes flights in a private jet and five star accommodation.

The trip is bespoke - so its price and content is flexible - but the company warned that people will not be able to speed down a perilous cliff-top road in a supercar.

It is not apparent how life insurance will be fixed but the company is confident it will make it happen.

For £200,000, drivers can pick a car to borrow and choose one dangerous road from a list of the world’s 22 most perilous.

The two-day adventure includes private flights and luxury accommodation as well as an experienced instructor to guide drivers around the tricky courses.

Drivers choosing their journey - where one false move could be their last - can select a route from a cliff-top single track road with deadly drops in Pakistan to highways renowned for their bandits in Mexico.

In fact, they can choose any of the locations shown on an interactive map, which includes 22 routes with ‘fear factor’ ratings and perilous facts about them.

The map, which was created by Hertfordshire-based Driving Experiences and was featured on MailOnline earlier this year, led to the creation of the lavish mini-break.

There is one full day of driving with an instructor in a dual-controlled car included in the trip.

Included in the holiday is one full day of driving with an experienced instructor that will teach the driver to handle a car on roads such as the Trans Siberian Highway in Russia, which might look fairly safe, but has loose and icy surfaces

The brochure says: ‘If you’re looking to 
travel further afield, look no further than the ‘Road of Death’ in 
Bolivia. This incredible drive is suitable for only the most fearless 
explorers – with narrow tracks winding round steep mountains and sheer 
1,000 metre drops, this location is considered among the most hazardous 
in South America – luckily, you’ll be partnered with experienced 
instructor, in case things get hairy!’

As the trip is completely bespoke, in theory a driver could choose a supercar to weave around cliff-top roads or on lethal gravelly pathways, but Buyagift.com said it might prove frustrating in some circumstances as people will not be allowed to drive recklessly and endanger their lives, so a more practical vehicle might prove more comfortable.

There is a wide range of vehicles to choose from, from souped-up Nissan Skylines and reliable saloons, right up to supercars such as the Bugatti Veyron Supersport, which is the fastest street-legal production car in the world.

‘People will be driving in very controlled circumstances. There’s no way they will put their foot down.

'It’s about taking in the journey and watching the mayhem,’ a company spokesman told MailOnline.

Drivers can choose from a wide range of vehicles in which to take on the dangerous roads, from souped-up Nissan Skylines and reliable saloons, right the way to top-of-the-range supercars like the Bugatti Veyron (pictured) - the fastest street-legal production car in the world

A spokesman from Buyagift.com said that anyone who goes on the holiday will be driving 'in very controlled circumstances' so they cannot race a Ferrari down the Guoliang Tunnel road, (pictured) for example. 'There's no way they will put their foot down. It's about taking in the journey and watching the mayhem,' he said

To begin the adventure, once a driver has boarded a private plane and touched down in their chosen location, they will meet their instructor and run through a full professional safety briefing.

They will stay the night at a five-star hotel and then being let loose on the road the following day.

‘You’ll spend an exhilarating day behind the wheel, facing up to the tightest of corners and terrifying sheer drops, with severe weather conditions and battered roads providing an injection of adrenaline to this white-knuckle ride of an experience,’ the company said.

It is not absolutely clear how insurance will be arranged, but Buyagift said that the trip is completely flexible and will be built to suit an individual's needs. The price could also be altered depending on the location of the chosen journey.

The firm has received a number of enquiries from customers about the prospect of a trip, but no-one has snapped up the holiday yet.

They warned that the short break is not suitable for anyone with a heart condition or nervous disposition and that drivers must have a valid driving license and passport.

The interactive map, by Hertfordshire- based Driving Experiences is based upon the World Health Organisation's (WHO) global status report of 2013 on road safety and users can click on 22 locations to view the most dangerous roads. The popularity of the map inspired the adventurous £200,000 mini break

The holiday was created about after MailOnline featured a map of the world’s 22 most dangerous drives and many people expressed a wish to try their driving skills on some of the terrifying journeys.

According to the map, the
 North Yungas road in Bolivia is widely considered to be the world’s 
most dangerous route and has even earned the nickname of ‘death road’.

The
 40-mile stretch of single-track road meanders round cliffs and there 
are no barriers to protect drivers going in opposite directions from 
deadly drops.

The interactive map is based upon the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) global status report of 2013 on road safety as well as other data sets.

Scotland's A726, otherwise known as the old A74 has a fear factor of four out of 10 n the map, which explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions. Buyagift.com said that is a UK customer chose the route for their 2-day holiday, it would not cost £200,000

Each road is rated according to its ‘fear factor’ with the North Yungas scoring 10 out of 10, while Pakistan’s picturesque-sounding Fairy Meadows Road was rated the second scariest because of its ‘treacherous high altitude, unstable and narrow mountain roads.’

Factors such as altitude, safety precautions in place including barriers, local driving techniques, the condition of vehicles, road surfaces, annual road deaths per country and weather conditions were all taken into account when producing the map and surprisingly such dangers seem to appeal to many adventurers.

Users can click on red explanation marks on the map to explore different deadly routes, where there are also facts about countries’ road rules and scary statistics. 

From cliff-top single track roads with deadly drops to highways rebound for their bandits, drivers could choose to take on the North Yungas road in Bolivia (pictured) which is widely considered to be the world's most dangerous route

If a driver chose the Trans Siberian Highway, pictured, they could potentially face the rain and uneven surfaces in a sports car - but the company offering the holiday warned that they would have to drive slowly and a vehicle with chunkier tyres would offer a more comfortable ride

The world’s longest road – the Pan-American Highway, which begins in Alaska and passes through countries in South America - is included on the map because of its high temperatures, landslides, impassable sections in wet weather and even livestock in the road.

But closer to home, Scotland’s A726, otherwise known as the old A74, has a fear factor of four out of 10.

The map explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions and has racked up nearly 40 fatalities between 2000 and 2005.

A high proportion of the accidents involved pedestrians or cyclists, while one fifth saw vehicles leave the road, which is exceptionally twisty for a dual carriageway and is also busy.

Norway’s Trollstigen or ‘troll ladder’ comprises many hairpin bends and sheer drops which get particularly perilous in icy conditions, while Brazil’s Rodovia da Morte puts drivers at risk in a very different way.

The ‘highway of death’ is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and is poorly maintained, with gangs and bandits along its long stretch.

The map, which lists roads all over the world, was created to highlight the dangers of driving, as although road safety is improving, over 1.2million people are killed in road accidents each year and a further 20 to 50million are injured.
