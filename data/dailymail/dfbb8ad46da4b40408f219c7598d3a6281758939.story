Arsenal legend Martin Keown believes Per Mertesacker's omission from Arsenal's starting line-up for Sunday's win over Everton 'could be a defining moment in changing the club's back four'.

January signing Gabriel Paulista was preferred to the German in defence, with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger telling BT Sport that the change was made in order to give Mertesacker a rest. 

Sportsmail's Keown, speaking as a pundit on BT Sport, reacted to the news of Mertesacker's absence for the crucial game at the Emirates saying: 'I don't you can point the finger at one player after the Monaco game. It's a big chance for Gabriel now, though.

'I think it could be a defining moment in changing Arsenal's back four now, for sure.

'Mertesacker, with the experience he has in the game, should have been calling these young players back the other night, the two full-backs were just drifting up the pitch and not coming back.

'When he's been left isolated one-on-one he struggles due to his lack of pace too. Gabriel is keen to defend so he'll be relishing this opportunity to stamp a claim for a first-team spot.'

Arsene Wenger has come under a barrage of criticism after Arsenal's shock defeat to Monaco on Wednesday

Wenger, who has come under fierce criticism after Wednesday night's 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League, maintained he is still fully committed to Arsenal, urging supporters to stand by the team ahead of the 2-0 win over Roberto Martinez's men.

In an interview with BT Sport he said: 'We have always been united at Arsenal so I ask the fans to stay behind the team and show  how strong you believe in the team even after Wednesday's disappointing result.

‘In the last 25 years I’ve always finished in the top three four and that consistency has given me belief and confidence to continuing to manage at the highest level. I’m as committed as I’ve ever been to deliver success to this team.'
