A balloon aviator who had to abort his attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean just 12 hours into his flight has described the dramatic moment he crash landed.

Speaking for the first time via his messaging system, Jonathan Trappe told Barcroft Media he thought he would die as his vessel plummeted to the ground.

'Honestly did not know if I would survive that landing!' said the 39-year-old, who landed in pitch darkness.

'Situation stable. Have 60l water 38L. Gatorade 60,000 cal food. Have shelter and exposure gear.'

'Alternate location': A GPS tracker shows the flight path of balloon aviator Jonathan Trappe before he was forced to abort his bid to cross the Atlantic in Newfoundland just 12 hours into the challenge

Jonathan Trappe set off this morning on a 2,500 mile journey across the Atlantic Ocean relying on 370 helium balloons to fly him safely to Europe

Putting on a brave face: Mr Trappe posted a tongue-in-cheek update on Facebook after landing in Newfoundland. Earlier, it had been going so well for the first few hours

The cluster balloonist was attempting 
to cross the Atlantic using giant balloons filled with helium, but was 
forced to make an early landing in Newfoundland, Canada, due to a 
technical issue.

There were commiserations around the world - including one from Virgin boss and fellow balloonist, Richard Branson.

He
 tweeted: 'Commiserations to Jonathan Trappe, who has abandoned his 
UP-style cluster balloon crossing. I know how you must feel!'

Fans
 of the adventurer who were following his movements via a satellite 
tracker were first alerted to his plight at around 7.30pm EST.

Trappe wrote on his Facebook page: 'Hmm, this doesn't look like France.'

He
 later followed up with: 'Landed safe, at an alternate location. Remote.
 I put the exposure canopy up on the boat. Will stay here for the 
night.'

The IT consultant from Raleigh, North 
Carolina, US, took off yesterday morning at 6.30am EST attempting to be 
the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean via cluster balloon.

Crowds gather to wave the IT specialist off in Caribou, Maine, this morning as he begins his attempt to become the first man to successfully cross the Atlantic in this way

The IT specialist took off at 6.20am this morning in front of volunteers and supporters. His team of meteorologists will monitor his progress using a satellite phone

Though admitting weather was the most dangerous aspect of the journey Mr Trappe was not put off by the thick fog he faced this morning as he hovered above Caribou, Maine

Kevin Knapp, speaking from the command
 centre overseeing Trappe's flight, said: 'I can confirm that Jonathan 
was forced to abandon the planned flight at around 18.30 EST.

'Thankfully he is safe and well and currently making preparations to get home.

'While
 disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the Atlantic short, I
 know Jonathan thanks everyone for their support and encouragement.'

Despite
 fears Atlantic weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to 
achieving his dream crossing, the landing was blamed on a technical 
problem relating to the balloons.

Trappe and his team 
had faced an agonising wait of more than 100 days in Caribou, Maine, for
 the right weather conditions to carry him across the Atlantic to 
Europe.

The latest weather reports suggested winds would take Trappe to western Europe but unpredictable conditions could see him land anywhere between Morocco and Iceland

The IT technical project manager and his team have been waiting almost 100 days for good enough weather conditions to begin the journey which is expected to last between three and five days

Trappe already holds the record for the longest-ever cluster balloon flight after crossing the English Channel in 2012 and the Alps in 2011 when he suspended an office chair from similar helium balloons to those used in this journey

Global weather 
systems being monitored by the project meteorologists started lining up 
on Monday, but local storms around Maine threatened to destroy the 
cluster balloon system and forced Trappe to stay grounded.

Trappe
 said: 'It was nail biting waiting for a weather window that would allow
 me to get up into the air and catch those transatlantic winds we'd been
 seeing. I need to get on them and ride them across like a conveyor belt.'

His
 planned route would have seen him hitch a ride on winds propelling him 
towards Europe - potentially landing anywhere between Iceland and 
Morocco.

Trappe already holds the record for the longest ever cluster balloon flight of 14 hours.

He became the only person to have crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon in May 2010, and the Alps in September 2011.

Previous
 flights had seen him travel in a simple office chair suspended by the 
balloons, however, for this attempt he travelled in a small yellow life 
boat in case of a sea landing.

Volunteers help inflate the 370 balloons which Trappe will gradually deflate to control his descent once above dry land in several days time

Five people have died in the past trying to make the 2,500 mile journey in conventional hot air balloons or single gas balloons as the result of unexpected winds and storms

12 previous attempts have been made to traverse the Atlantic Ocean using balloons though none has been successful. In 2008 A Brazilian priest died trying to make the journey using helium filled birthday balloons

Trappe is relying on state-of-the-art weather data from the meteorologist who advised Felix Baumgartner on his record-breaking skydive from the stratosphere last year

The 370 balloons have been attached to a lifeboat which will save Mr Trappe's life if he drops into water at any point in the dangerous journey

Volunteers clutch on to seven helium balloons ahead of Trappe's take off this morning after the journey was put on hold for months due to poor weather conditions

Colonel Joe Kittinger, 84, who acted as Capsule Communicator during Felix Baumgartner's skydive from space, has aided with preparations for the dangerous journey

Mr Trappe's partner Nidia Ramirez was there to wave him off this morning as he prepares to embark on the 2,500 mile flight which could see him reach altitudes of 25,000ft

Mr Trappe said though he was aware how dangerous the feat is, he wants to live an interesting life and 'go forward in the spirit of adventure'

Life imitates art: In the Pixar film, Carl Fredricksen strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the U.S. to South America

Speaking
 immediately before take-off yesterday, Trappe said: 'This is far greater
 than anything achieved before. I'm looking at 62 hours or longer.'

'If
 I touch down on water then the attempt will be over as it will be 
impossible to take off again, but the boat will keep me alive.

'It
 will be incredibly dangerous as I could be several days away from any 
rescue crew and it will mean surviving rough seas for a long time, 
alone.'

While Trappe is the 
first ever to attempt an Atlantic cluster balloon crossing, five people 
have died trying to cross the ocean in 12 total attempts using hot-air 
balloons or more conventional single gas balloons.

Trappe
 said: 'I'm just as afraid of dying as anyone.

'But I go forward in the 
spirit of adventure, doing something nobody has achieved before, and to 
live an interesting life.'

Also
 advising on the project was aviation hero Colonel Joseph Kittinger, 84,
 who acted as Capsule Communicator during Felix Baumgartner's skydive 
from space.

He was also the first person to make a solo Atlantic crossing by gas balloon, in 1984.

'I
 accepted the role of advisor on this project because I want to help a 
young man achieve his dream, to reach his goal,' said Kittinger.

'Like me, Trappe wants to be remembered for achieving something that nobody has achieved before him,

'I'm here because I believe he can do it.

'His planning has been meticulous and if anyone can make this, he can.'
