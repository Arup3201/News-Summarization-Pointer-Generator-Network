National Security Advisor Susan Rice has denied that NSA officials have ever deliberately lied to Congress about spying on American citizens as part of intelligence gathering operations.

Speaking to 60 Minutes on Sunday, Rice said NSA officials had never deliberately told lies but had ‘inadvertently made false representations’ which ‘they themselves have discovered it and corrected it.’

Rice also said that NSA leaker Edward Snowden should ‘be sent back’ to the U.S. and ‘face justice.’

National Security Advisor Susan Rice has denied that NSA officials have ever deliberately lied to Congress about spying on American citizens as part of intelligence gathering operations

House Republicans are currently demanding a criminal probe for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for his flat-out denial in March, three months before the Snowden leaks began, that the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans.

Rice also insisted that NSA surveillance has been worth is and ‘the fact that we have not had a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11 should not be diminished.’

The National Security Advisor also insisted that she has no regrets about taking the series of Sunday show interviews that brought her career under fire in September 2012.

Asked why Hillary Clinton didn’t appear for interviews following the lethal attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Rice said she had
 filled in willingly because of the then-secretary of state’s 
particularly ‘painful’ and ‘stressful’ week.

CBS host Lesley Stahl pressed Rice on whether she ever wished she hadn't taken the Benghazi interviews which forced her to pull out of becoming secretary of state

‘I don’t have time to think about the false controversy,’ she said.

‘In the midst of all of swirl about things like talking points, the administration has been working very, very hard across the globe to review our security of our embassies and our facilities. That’s what we ought to be focused on.’

Speaking in 2012 on multiple TV shows four days after the Benghazi attacks killed four, Rice stuck to the initial White House line that the attacks were a spontaneous response to protest an anti-Muslim video.

‘This is not an expression of hostility in the broadest sense toward the United States or to U.S. policy,’ Rice said at the time.

Accusations that Rice made deliberately misleading statements about the attacks being ‘spontaneous’ in the interviews later led her, interviewer Lesley Stahl said, to miss a chance to be nominated as secretary of state.

Rice also said that NSA leaker Edward Snowden should 'be sent back' to the U.S. and 'face justice'

CBS host Stahl pressed on whether Rice ever wished she hadn’t taken the interviews“I' you hadn’t taken those interviews, I’d be calling you madam secretary,' Stahl said.

'You can call me Susan,' Rice shot back, ending questions on the incident for which the former U.N. ambassador has become most known.
