The happy moment they had waited thirty years for took place at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego on Friday.

Williamson was just 6 years old the last time he saw his sister.

When their parents separated he stayed with their father, while Murray, 14, moved away with their mother.

Friday, the siblings reconnected with an emotional embrace. Williamson gave his sister an honorable Navy salute and hugged her tightly. 

'It's my brother!' Murray said with tears in her eyes.

Despite trying to find each other for years and years, neither sibling seemed to have any luck.

'I tried looking on Facebook, but there are a million Robert Williamsons. There are a million Bobby Williamsons. Without pictures, I wouldn’t have known what he looked like anyway,' said Murray.

Murray is a senior nursing officer assigned to NMCSD's Military Health Center. Williamson is in the Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 122 at Naval Air Station Lemoore, Calif.

After the siblings' parents separated, Murray took her mother's maiden name, making it difficult for Williamson to find his sister.

Two months ago Murray called her estranged father who told her that her brother was a chief in the Navy.

Within only 15 minutes of giving her brother's name to her leading chief petty officer (LCPO),  the pair were on the phone. Chief Petty Officer Hospital Corpsman Jeremy Simon, and he made the siblings’ connection possible.

Williamson reported that he was in shock. According to Williamson, Murray's LCPO called saying, 'I'm pretty sure my boss is your sister. Do you have a sister named Cindy?'

Williamson replied, 'Yes, I do.'

After their first phone call, the brother and sister would talk to each other frequently in attempts to reclaim lost time.

Even though the two spent years apart, they have a lot of common qualities.

'We both love Goldfish crackers and we both love the same types of TV shows,' said Murray.

'He was like my live doll. I would cook in my Easy-Bake-Oven for him. I remember holding him when he was just a tiny baby,' said Murray.

'Our Navy is awesome and to find out that they are both serving does not surprise me. There is a bond among siblings and where one is serving you can usually find another,' Simon said.

Chief Simon said that reuniting the siblings was one of the 'proudest moments' of his career.

'The main thing is to never give up,” said Williamson.

'Multiple times she looked and looked and one little phone call ended 30 years of no contact. Amazing. Outstanding,' he continued.

The siblings plan to see each other as much as possible. Williamson and his wife are going to spend the weekend in San Diego with his sister.They are also planning a trip to Cabo San Lucas.
