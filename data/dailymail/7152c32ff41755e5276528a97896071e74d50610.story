Grand National winning jockey Ryan Mania has been airlifted to hospital after a serious fall at Hexham today.

Reports from the track suggest Mania, who was riding Stagecoach Jasper in the St John Lee Handicap Hurdle, may have been struck by the hooves of another runner after he hit the floor.

He was treated behind screens for nearly 25 minutes as racing was delayed at the course. Reports suggest he was conscious.

It was reported that Mania's injuries may not have been as bad as first feared later on Sunday evening.

Paul Struthers, chief executive of 
the Professional Jockeys Association, tweeted: '@Mania450 is in hospital
with friends and family. He's awaiting scan results. Fingers crossed 
not as bad as first feared. He thanks everyone for their well wishes. 
Further updates when we have them.'

A spokesman for the Great North Air 
Ambulance said: 'Mr Mania has received neck and back injuries. He came 
off the horse at high speed and may have been hit by another horse while
he was on the ground.

'He has been given extensive painkillers
and is currently in a stable condition. He has been taken to the Royal 
Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.'

Clerk
of the course James Armstrong said: 'All I can say at the moment is 
he's conscious and talking and he is being taken to the Royal Victoria 
Infirmary in Newcastle for further assessment.

'Hopefully all will be fine, but we won't have any more news until later.'

Valet Steve Charlton to 
racingpost.com: ‘I think Ryan has taken a kick between the shoulder 
blades but he can move all his limbs and is talking. Hopefully, he is 
not too bad but as usual they are being careful.’

Ewan Whillans will substitute for him on his only other booked mount, Twice Lucky in the 4.25 race.

Stagecoach Jasper, like Mania's National-winning horse Auroras Encore, is trained by Sue Smith.

Only hours earlier Mania, 23, had 
spoken 
of his pride at winning the biggest steeplechase in the world. Auroras 
Encore was a 66-1 shot. Cappa Bleu was in second and Teaforthree in 
third.
