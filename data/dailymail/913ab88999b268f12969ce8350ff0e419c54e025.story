The Syrian Electronic Army and celebrity prank group Exposed have both been linked to hoaxes against the Associated Press and the White House.

A group of Syrian hackers claimed responsibility for hacking the AP twitter account yesterday afternoon and posting a false report about explosions at the White House.

Meanwhile in a separate prank, Exposed, the group behind most major celebrity swatting, is reported to have claimed responsibility for a 911 bomb threat hoax phone call directed at the White House.

But today sources close to the investigation have told TMZ that both groups are linked and have members working for both operations.

Hacked: This terrifying report of explosions at the White House injuring President Obama has been deemed false after the Associated Press said they had been hacked

The message 'Breaking: Two 
Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured,' was tweeted 
from the Associated Press news agency, causing panic to some of their 
near 2 million followers.

Meanwhile Exposed reportedly made a hoax call pretending to threaten to detonate eight devices around the White House if President Obama does not declare war against North Korea within 24 hours, according to TMZ.

Exposed responsible for exposing private financial information about Michelle Obama, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Britney Spears, Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian.

After yesterday's fake tweet the White House and AP assured the 
public minutes later that the report was not true but word didn't appear
 to come fast enough to those frantically watching and responding on Wall Street.

New target? Exposed, the group behind exposing private financial information about Michelle Obama and Kim Kardashian reportedly made a hoax call pretending to threaten to bomb the White House

All safe: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also told the media on Tuesday that the President is fine

The White House was the latest media company to be targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army which says it is ‘supporting the Syrian people against #FSA (Free Syrian Army) terrorism’.

Two days ago the SEA claimed responsibility for hacking the Twitter accounts of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the official FIFA World Cup account.

On its website, available in Arabic and English, the SEA declares states it is 'supporting the cause of the Syrian Arab people by armaments with science and knowledge against the campaigns led by the Arab media and Western on our Republic by broadcasting fabricated news about what is happening in Syria.'

In the past few months the hacking group has been particularly active. There are reports it may have been launched in retaliation to the hacking of private Assad family emails, which were released to the media in early 2012.

Last month several official BBC Twitter accounts were hacked by the SEN.

It sent a series of tweets from the accounts, including several with anti-Israeli sentiments on the day that U.S. President Barack Obama visited the country.

Others targeted in the past include 
the Agence France-Presse agency, whose @AFPphoto account was taken over 
in February and images purporting to be from the warzone in Syria were 
posted.

The group has previously claimed 
credit for hacking the Twitter and Facebook accounts of Sky News Arabia,
 Al-Jazeera Mobile, German Deutsche Welle, France 24 and Israeli 
newspaper Haaretz.

Yesterday they It is thought they use 
SEA used fairly simple phishing attacks via emails - recipients are 
asked to click on a link in order to access their password.

The prank plunged the DOW Jones 
Industrial average more than 100 points and the Standard & Poor's 
500 to lose $136.5 billion.

In a graph capturing traders' apparent panic, the DOW Jones Industrial average took a straight dive plunging from about 14,700 to around 14,570 before gradually shooting back up in a three-minute roller coaster.

The S&P 500 Index also fell about 1 percent, wiping out $136.5 billion before gradually recovering their loses,
 according to Reuters data.

Amid the hysteria the volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange blew up to an intra-day high of 3.06 million.

The alarming message by the AP appeared retweeted at least 1,181 times before its deletion.

Both the DOW Jones and the S&P regained their previous levels following word of the news agency's hacking minutes later.

An editor with the AP wrote: 'Please ignore AP tweet on explosions, we've been hacked.'

'The President is fine, I was just with him,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also told the media.

The Syrian Electronic Army, celebrated on their Facebook wall the impact made on stock
 prices.

The AP has since temporarily suspended 
their main Twitter account as well as their mobile Twitter account, both
 of which they say were hacked.

The attack was preceded by a phishing attempt on their corporate network, the news agency said.

At the time of their Tweet they had a reported following of 1,905,403.

Some traders blamed automatic electronic 
trading for the sharp fall and recovery and not human reaction to the report.

'No human believed the story. Only 
the computers react to something that serious disseminated in such a 
way. I bought some stock well and did not sell into it. Humans win,' 
Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in New 
York, overseeing $8 billion in assets, told Bloomberg.

Jonathan
 Corpina said he was standing on the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange when he got word of the alleged explosions and called a client 
two blocks from the White House to confirm.

Billions gone: Similarly seen the S&P 500 dropped about 1 percent wiping out $136.5 billion before almost as quickly recovering from their losses amid the scare

'He did not know what I was talking about,' Corpina, who's a senior managing partner with Meridian Equity Partners Inc. told Bloomberg Radio. ]'He said I’m staring at the White House and there’s nothing going on here right now.'

He also partially blamed algorithmic trading programs that react to certain headlines.

'It puts into perspective our 
increasing dependence on technology and communications,' said Bill 
Baruch, senior market strategist at iiTRADER.com remarking on Twitter's 
impact on the stock market.

'As
 we put more and more trust in technology for our communications, it 
brings us back to reality in the sense that these communications are 
easily misconstrued, easily hacked, so not only can people put out false
 information, but they can capitalize on it,' he said.

Hackers: A group claiming responsibility for the hacking posted this apparent screen grab taken from their computer showing their infiltration

The AP is the latest media organization to come under siege from hackers in a spate of high profile incidents over the past several months.

The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal said their systems were hacked, prompting the White House and lawmakers to push through legislation that will help better defend against cyber attacks.

Reuters News said in August one of its Twitter accounts was hacked and false tweets were posted, mainly related to the armed struggle in Syria.

The bogus report of explosions in the heart of Washington, D.C. comes eight days after the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 200 others.
