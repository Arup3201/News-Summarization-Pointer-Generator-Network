I step away from my team-mates on the halfway line and head towards the goal.

Making his way from the left is Iker Casillas, Spain‘s goalkeeper. I don’t see him. I don’t see anything.

Not one of the best keepers in the world circa 2002. Not the goal. Not the 70,000 in the Suwon Stadium, although the scene behind the goal is a blur of green.

I just want to know where the ball is.

Pressure: Kevin Kilbane hangs his head after missing a decisive penalty against Spain at the 2002 World Cup

In my mind I go through the penalty kick to beat Casillas and get us to the quarter-finals. The quarter-finals. Beyond our wildest dreams. I try to get it all out of my head.

From the day we joined up for the World Cup in Dublin, we practised penalties after every session. Mick McCarthy got some stick for saying, in his usual blunt and honest way, that he never saw the point. And he was right. You can never replicate the pressure of the real thing.

The competition is always fierce in training. Believe me, I have seen penalty competitions nearly come to blows and some festering resentments. Goalkeepers don’t like conceding penalties. Ever. Especially Shay Given. And especially if the penalty taker tries to take the mickey, or tries something they would never try in a game, such as the Pirlo chip.

At the end of those sessions in Ireland, England, Saipan, Japan and South Korea, I’d usually drill the ball with power to the keeper’s left.

Yet when it came to hitting that ball in Suwon that night, for a place in the quarter-finals, I tried to place it and didn’t get the right connection. I don’ t know why. But I do know Casillas saved it.

I don’t think there was a lower point in my career, certainly not an occasion I felt I had let so many people down. The words of consolation from Mick, my team-mates, friends and family took a while sink in.

Brothers in arms: Manchester missed four of five penalties as they were beaten by Sunderland in the Capital One Cup

On the spot: Danny Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj (R) were guilty of not scoring their penalties

Six months later, an FA Cup tie with Sunderland against Blackburn Rovers and we went to a penalty shoot-out. I’d never shirked one before and I made sure I took one, going second after Kevin Phillips. And I made sure I scored, striking the ball cleanly, powerfully, to Brad Friedel’s left. We won 3-0.

That helped bury the memory of South Korea for me. And the players who missed in the Capital One Cup semi-final at Old Trafford on Wednesday must step up again the next time they are in a penalty shoot-out.

If ever an occasion proved that the pressure of penalties gets to players it was surely on Wednesday night. Ten penalties, only three scored, and players who you would expect to bury the ball in the back of the net, missed.

When Craig Gardner stepped up as Sunderland’s first penalty taker it made complete sense. He can strike a ball, he has arguably the best technique in the Sunderland team, which is why he takes free-kicks and he is a confident player at set pieces. And he put his shot over the bar.

Steven Fletcher, a striker who hits the ball sweetly normally, barely managed to hit the goal-line. Danny Welbeck and Phil Jones missed the target and Adnan Januzaj, arguably the one Manchester United player who has played with real confidence all season for one so young, hit a weak penalty that Vito Mannone saved easily.

Howler: Jason Puncheon received plenty of stick for his badly missed penalty in Palace's game against Spurs

One other player who has had to come to terms with the pain of missing a vital penalty is Crystal Palace striker Jason Puncheon, who found his own way to get over the disappointment last week.

His penalty against Spurs was one of the worst the Barclays Premier League has seen and understandably some people were quick to take the mickey out of him. And that’s inevitable when you hit one as wildly as he did a fortnight ago.

Pundits, ex-players and even his former manager Neil Warnock had a go at him, and I can understand why he was upset at the attention he got for a few days. On reflection, he would be laughing himself if he had seen someone else take such a wild and poor a penalty.

Although Palace manager Tony Pulis was upset immediately afterwards, he stood by Puncheon, who is a very talented player. There was never any doubt about him playing Pulis’ former team Stoke City last week. And Puncheon backed his faith by scoring the winner.

The aftermath of that penalty miss was obviously not particularly nice for Jason. Many of us saw his reaction on Twitter, and he did bite to the criticism and the ‘jokes’.

David Moyes always used to tell us that it takes courage to step over that white line because you are vulnerable, especially when things go wrong. But it is still the best way of answering the critics.

Red tape: Accrington Stanley have been fined £20,000 because James Beattie doesn't carry a coaching license

James Beattie and Accrington Stanley should be receiving all the help they can get as they try to stay in the Football League.

Instead they get a £20,000 fine from the very same organisation because my former Everton team-mate didn’t have the correct coaching qualifications.

Rules are rules, and no manager in League One or League Two can work without their UEFA B licence, I understand that. But seriously, what purpose does it serve fining a cash-strapped club like Accrington?

This is a club who James helped bail out in the summer by financing a club debt. Surely that loyalty should be recognised too.

And he is not just a Sunday League manager who has been handed the reins by Accrington. James Beattie is a former England international and Premier League player who is now trying to make a living at a very difficult level and at a club who have to watch every penny. He also has Paul Stephenson alongside him, who is qualified, and vastly experienced and know what he’s doing.

Sir Alex Ferguson managed to manage without the pro-licence, and it didn’t seem to do the new UEFA coaching ambassador any harm.

I know the game has changed, and the FA and Football League want to ensure ex-players are properly qualified, but they don’t exactly make it easy for players to get their coaching qualifications.

Although the FA are now running courses during the season, only a small percentage are enrolling. When I was a player – and I now have my A licence and will be completing the pro-licence this summer – courses were run over a four to six week period during the close season. But that’s a time when the last thing some players want to do is spend more time playing or learning about football. Sometimes they need a complete break from the game. And if they don’t their families do.

Before I retired, I was asked to speak to a club about a vacancy but I couldn’t even go for the interview because I didn’t have my pro-licence. And yet I know having that qualification would have made absolutely no difference if I’d taken the job, and not having it would not have hindered me.

Endurance test: Accrington Stanley are struggling to stay in the Football League

Part of the Football League fine was suspended provided James gets his B licence. And he now has it.

But far more important than that certificate is the experience he will gain in one of the most difficult jobs in the country, in one of the most precarious divisions in the world. Longevity is not exactly a word you hear often round the League Two clubs is it?

It has not been an easy first season, in fact they looked doomed after a couple of months, but he has turned things round and got some good results and given himself and Accrington a chance of staying in the Football League.

And I just think he deserved a bit more help and understanding from the authorities to do that.

Just desserts: Sunderland's long suffering fans deserve a date at Wembley under Gus Poyet

It’s an amazing achievement for Gus Poyet to get Sunderland to the Capital One Cup Final – beating Manchester United, Chelsea and Southampton on the way. No one could have predicted that when he took over in such tough circumstances.

And I am so pleased for Sunderland’s long-suffering fans. The noise and atmosphere they created at Old Trafford was brilliant and I hope they can enjoy their day out at Wembley.

There is no place in football for politics, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism or any form discrimination. End of story.
