Retired teacher Patrick Gallagher, 64, suffered a heart attack after arguing with neighbours over their loud music

A retired teacher died of a heart attack after neighbours placed a ghetto blaster on his doorstep and played 'a terrific volume of music', an inquest has heard.

Patrick Gallagher, 64, was found lying face down in a pool of blood in the doorway of his home in Healey, near Rochdale, after he rowed with his neighbours over the volume.

His wife of 32 years, Susan Gallagher, told an inquest into his death that the tragedy happened after she heard her neighbours playing music and went outside to investigate.

She told the hearing in Rochdale that after she had realised the noise was coming from neighbour John Butterworth’s house, she returned home and discussed with her husband whether they should call the police.

The couple were then interrupted by even more noise.

Mrs Gallagher said: 'We were both still in the living room.

'Suddenly there was a terrific volume of music immediately outside the house.

'It was the sort of volume you would experience in a fairground.'

In a written statement, Mrs Gallagher 
said that her husband had witnessed a woman placing what appeared to be a
‘ghetto-blaster’ outside their door.

He then went out to investigate when he was confronted by neighbours John Butterworth and Stephen and Sharon Maloney, the inquest was told.

Mrs Gallagher said: 'I heard voices. I heard him saying, ‘What are you playing at?’ He wasn’t especially angry. It was, if you like, said in a teacher’s voice.'

Mrs Gallagher said Mr Maloney repeatedly warned Mr Gallagher not to ‘make an enemy’ out of him before lunging at him on the doorstep.

She said Mr Maloney was then grabbed by his wife, causing him to stagger sideways.

Tragic: The middle house belonged to Mr Gallagher, who died in the doorway

At this point, she said, she ran upstairs to ring the police.

When she returned, the inquest heard, everyone had disappeared from the doorstep and the music had been switched off.

She told the inquest: 'I made the 999 call and left the receiver off because the call handler asked me to go downstairs and see what was happening.

'All music and everything had been switched off. It was a strange atmosphere.'

Mrs Gallagher then saw her husband collapsed in the doorway.

He was taken to hospital shortly after the incident, at 10pm on August 14, and died three days later after suffering a series of irregularities with his heart.

Giving evidence at the inquest, pathologist Dr Naomi Carter said Mr Gallagher had suffered a heart attack and collapsed after developing a blood clot due to the stress of the argument.

Dr Carter said: 'When someone is involved in a stressful event, it’s a common experience that your heart beats faster.

'The reason that he developed the blood clot and collapsed when he did is as a direct result of this incident in its entirety.'

Five people were arrested in connection with the incident but were later released without charge. The inquest continues.
