Media blackout on American publication's reports on Wen Jiabao's family wealth

New York Times website and web searches of the names of the Prime Minister's family have been blocked

Mr Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law appear to have accumulated most of the wealth

The family of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao have accumulated some $27 billion - but reports of that vast fortune have been blocked in the Communist state

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family have accumulated vast wealth during his time in power, but reports of their $2.7 billion fortune have been blocked in his country.

A New York Times article describing how the Prime Minister's mother, siblings and children amassed their affluence prompted the powers-that-be in the Communist state to block the newspaper's website both in English and Chinese.

Searches for the publication's site as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the country's main microblog service with the Chines government describing the feature as a 'smear'.

The article stated that the family of Mr Wen, 70, known for his humble background - his mother was a teacher and his father tended pigs, have accumulated most of their assets since Wen was named vice premier in 1998 before his promotion to Prime Minister nine years ago.

The estimate of his family's wealth was made according to a review of corporate and regulatory records from 1992 to 2012.

According to the review, his widowed mother Yang Zhiyun, 90, has had just one investment to her name - in a financial services company with assets worth $120 million in 2007.

Aside from his mother, Mr Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law appear to have made most of the money with their 'knack for aggressive deal making,' as the Times describes it.

No holdings were found in Mr Wen's own name.

The family has assets in telecommunications companies, jewellers, tourist resorts, and banks among other projects and the records show that family business ventures received support from state owned corporations such as the nation's largest mobile phone operator China Mobile.

One of those holdings includes a stake in a company that helped build stadia ahead of Beijing's 2008 Olympics, including the iconic Birds Nest national stadium.

The article said: 'In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners.'

The family also profited from opportunities arising from state decisions according to the report - though it is not known what role Mr Wen plays in those decisions.

Mr Wen's younger brother Wen Jiahong was awarded $30 million in government contracts as part of a crackdown on medical wasted disposal following the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and to handle wastewater management in several of China's biggest cities.

The newspaper cited one holding as being with insurance company Ping An which benefited from reforms brought about under Mr Wen's jurisdiction.

His wife Zhang Beili is a leading authority on jewellery and a state diamond company that she ran were privatised.

His son Wen Yungsong sold a technology company for $10 million and used another investment vehicle to set up one of the country's biggest equity firms.

But state documents leaked by Wikileaks two years ago suggested that Mr Wen, known as a populist premier, was aware of his relatives' business dealings and said to be unhappy with them.

The Chinese government's blocking of the reports are by no means the first time that news has been censored in the country.

Last year coverage of a high speed rail crash which killed 40 people close to Wenzhou in the Zhejiang Province was blocked.

Similarly, nothing was reported of an uprising in Wukon late last year.

In June, the Bloomberg website was blocked after an investigative report into the finances of the family of president in waiting Xi Jinping.

Mr Wen will step down as part of a transition of power on November 8.
