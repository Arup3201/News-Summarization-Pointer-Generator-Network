Former England midfielder Peter Reid said he would never forgive Diego Maradona for the ‘Hand of God’ 
goal which helped knock England out of the 1986 World Cup finals.

But when Reid bumped into Maradona while filming at the Argentina legend's new club in Dubai, they literally kissed and made up.

Reid
is filmed laughing and joking with Maradona, whose two goals put Sir 
Bobby Robson’s England side out of the quarter-finals in Mexico.

The former Everton star - who later became a manager - was one of 
several players left trailing in Maradona's wake when he scored a superb second goal to knock England out. They lost the game 2-1.

During their exchange, Reid joked with Maradona that he wanted to see his face - because he had only seen his back during the infamous World Cup quarter final.

The
footage from Abu Dhabi Sports TV shows Reid embracing the Argentine and
then, when Maradona’s left hand is around his shoulder, he gives it a 
quick kiss.

Reid said:
‘It was good to see him and we had a bit of light-hearted banter and a 
good laugh. I think I look in better shape than he does now anyway! 

‘I
told him the only mistake I made in my playing career was not catching 
him and kicking him and I still think that.

'We had a nice chat and I 
finished by telling him, through the interpreter, that he still 
handballed it. And he seemed to accept that.’

The footage, which came to light this week, has not sat well with die-hard England fans still bitter about the controversial first goal punched into the net 25 years ago.

Reid, 55, himself wrote in a column as recent as June this year, that Maradona was 'still a cheat' and that goalkeeper Peter Shilton 'should have just taken his head off'.

He concluded the reunion by embracing Maradona - who was banned from football for 15 months in 1991 for cocaine use - and declaring 'top man, you're a gentleman'.

After hugging one last time Maradona walks off and says to him over his shoulder 'now you come catch me'.

The legendary Argentinean international, who only speaks Spanish, spoke 
to former Leeds and Sunderland boss through an interpreter during their 
meeting in Dubai.

Robin Sanders, 46, from Birmingham, who travelled to Mexico in '86 and has been a regular at England home games ever since, said: 'Yes, it was a long time ago, and I don't mind a bit of banter with him after all this time, but to kiss the man's hand is a step too far.

'That hand knocked us out of the World Cup - and Reid is kissing it like he's royalty. It's an utter disgrace.

'To call him a "top man" seems a bit hypocritical, since he has been so outspoken in the past about what happened. It just appears like he doesn't remember the nation's heartbreak caused by Maradona blatantly cheating.

'Yes, the man was a genius on the football pitch, but he was also a cheat.'

Maradona beat England defenders, Peter Beardsley, Terry Butcher twice, Terry Fenwick and also outwitted Shilton to score his second goal of the game which dumped England out of the tournament.
