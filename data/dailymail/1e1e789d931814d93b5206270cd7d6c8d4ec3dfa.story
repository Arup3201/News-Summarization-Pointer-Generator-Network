A breakthrough technology that can create 'virtual babies' by digitally combining the DNA of two people is set to launch.

These virtual babies can then be screened
 for genetic diseases, before ruling out sperm donors or partners who could pose a risk to
 a potential baby’s health.

Dubbed Matchright, the technology could 
allow prospective parents to assess genetic risks even before a child is conceived.

New York-based group, Genepeeks, is about to launch a service in the U.S. capable of digitally combining the DNA of two people to create 'virtual babies'

The idea behind the technology came around six years ago when founder Anne Morriss, from New York, received a terrifying call.

When her baby was just a few days old, Ms Morriss was asked by a stranger over the phone to check whether the child was still alive.

‘Can you go check and confirm and come back to the phone?’ the voice insisted.

In shock Ms Morriss did just that. When she returned, the caller 
revealed that her son – conceived using a sperm donor - had tested 
positive for an inherited disorder called MCADD,

MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar and it can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. 

This was the moment that Ms Morriss’ life changed. According to a report in the Boston Globe, her shock at not knowing about the sperm donor’s genetic disorder prompted her to start a company, Genepeeks. 

Dubbed Matchright, the technology could allow prospective parents to assess the risks of genetic disease without having to have a real pregnancy from which to extract the DNA

The $1,995 (£1,200) works by first screening the prospective donors or parents for any genetic disorders, which involves sequencing their DNA.

Algorithms are then fed this data and use it to digitally recreate the process of genetic recombination – which is the mixing of genetic information between a sperm and an egg.

This produces up to 10,000 simulated embryos per pairing, which are all sequenced to look for mutations in single genes that can cause 500 rare diseases.

Computer software can then to work out the disease probability in the digital child and the client will get a list of ‘safe’ donors from which to choose.

Other companies are already able screen partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant.

But Genepeeks' new Matchright system is thought to be around 100,000 times more powerful that this technique, known as carrier screening.  

The $1,995 system (£1,200) works by first screening prospective donors or parents for any genetic disorders, which usually involves sequencing the DNA.

The company's founders said they plan to expand the screening process beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions.

In theory, the technology could be used to screen potential babies for traits other than diseases. It would also fall outside rules used to regulate embryo testing and screening.

The practice has raised some ethical questions about the prospect of ‘designer babies’.

The technology's patent includes a list of traits that aren't necessarily related to health – such as eye and skin pigmentation, according to a report by Catherine de Lange in New Scientist.

‘Where it is more ethically challenging is when you expand beyond couples in desperate need for a donor, to couples that are just interested in more trivial things,’ Dagan Wells at the University of Oxford told the magazine.

Professor Silver said that they are still undecided about what the patent will be used for in the future.

He added that owning the patent means the firm can prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.
