A blind drug dealer who sold cannabis from his home for a year and got his wife to check the deals were correct has been spared an immediate prison term.

Unemployed Assam Akram, 29, had lost his sight when he was 19, and had relied on his 27-year-old wife Samantha, a school cleaner, to oversee the sales.

However, the couple were exposed when police attended their home in Nelson, Lancashire, following reports of a fight, and found around 100 grams of cannabis, as well as £1,080 in cash.

Officers also found cannabis grinders, electronic scales and latex gloves.

Their mobile phones were analysed and showed text messages from clients asking for deals of £20 a time, involving amounts of around half-an-ounce.

Appearing before Burnley Crown Court, Akram and his wife of four years admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Akram also pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine. Each was given 15 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, with supervision.

He must attended a drugs rehabilitation programme and his wife was ordered to go to the Lancashire Women’s Specified Activity Requirement.

Akram was born with Retinitis Pigmentosa,
 a condition with affects the pigments on his eyes. He began to get 
vision problems at school and was registered blind in 2004 when he was 
19.

Wife: Samantha Akram said she smoked cannabis for stress and pain relief and received a suspended sentence

The drug dealing emerged last August after police arrested the couple over a public order allegation after a fight between them and a friend of the family who was accused of mocking Akram’s eyesight problems.

Police went into their home and an officer could smell cannabis. Samantha admitted she smoked the drug and said she had started taking it to get over a cancer scare.

However, Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said police searched the couple's home and found cannabis with a street value of about £1,000, kept in different parts of the house in different packaging. They also discovered 3.28 grams of cocaine, worth £300.

Messages going back to July 2012 were found on two phones, and the couple, who also had 'advertising messages' from cannabis suppliers, received texts asking about £10 and £20 deals, as well as amounts of a quarter and half-an-ounce.

'These messages go back to 2011, suggesting they have been using cannabis for some time before they have also branched out into dealing,' Mr Parker said.

He told the court that when the pair were questioned, Akram claimed he was looking after the cannabis for a friend and smoked about £30 worth a day.

Passing sentence Judge Simon Newell told the couple he was sentencing them for intending to supply about 100 grams of cannabis.

He added: 'You shouldn’t think for one moment I am not alert to the realities of what had been going on.

'The reality of what you two were doing is patently obvious from those texts and that is very serious.'

He said the fact the defendants had £1,080, when he was on benefits clearly gave the impression they were 'professionally and commercially dealing.'

He warned the pair: 'This stops now. You have been into this in a serious way, but it stops now. You have got a chance. Take it.'

Spared jail: Appearing before Burnley Crown Court, Akram and his wife of four years admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply, and were both handed suspended prison sentences

Speaking at their home after the hearing, Akram would only say: 'I was ashamed when I went to court. I was nervous.'

However, his wife said she set up the drug dealing operation on behalf of her husband so they could fund their own smoking habits.

'He is registered blind and can’t see anything,' she said.

'He relies on me and his family. My husband doesn’t go out very much. I get worried about him. He doesn’t like the light. There isn’t much future for him being blind.

'It was intent to supply because they found messages to my twin sister because she’d asked if I could sort her some out. I’ve not been done for street dealing. It wasn’t a huge amount. I was ashamed to go to crown court, I lost my job because of it. I won’t be allowed to work in a school again.

'I’m sorry and I wish I’d never done it, I really do. I know I should never have done it. My husband smokes cannabis through boredom, he doesn’t go out of the house. We’ve been married nearly four years and together for almost 14 years since school. It’s sad.

'He can do a lot for himself, well he tries to, he tries his best. I’m on depression tablets and some days I don’t want to get out of bed but I know I have to to look after him. It’s hard. I’m in remission now. I smoke it for stress and pain relief. It’s stupid and I know I need to stop, my life does really depend on it and that’s not what I want.

'Someone gave me an opportunity and I started to sell a bit for him. I wish I never did. He was very embarrassed too.'
