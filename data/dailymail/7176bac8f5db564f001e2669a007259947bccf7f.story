The Hard Rock Cafe's number one fan has spent more than £30,000 in his quest to visit every one of the rock 'n' roll themed restaurants in the world.

Kay Kalkbrenner, aged 28, has made it to 243 of the Cafes on five continents in locations as far flung as Kazakhstan and Cancun.

But after years of travelling and tens of thousands of pounds, Kay admits he has become so fed up of burgers and chips he now doesn't even order a meal.

Kay Kalkbrenner has travelled to 243 Hard Rock Cafés around the world in his quest to visit them all

He's travelled five continents in the last 15 years - often missing family occasions and using up his annual leave. Pictured: Kalkbrenner in front of the Buenos Aires branch

In his bid to visit all the restaurants, Kay has missed family occasions, paid thousands for long-haul flights and regularly uses up all of his annual leave.

But he doesn't regret his unusual quest.

Kay said: 'I love the Hard Rock Cafes because it gives you a good excuse to travel, but the best part is the people.

'The other collectors are all great, friendly and helpful - they make it worth it.'

Kay, originally from Frankfurt, Germany, is always planning his next trip and is constantly on the lookout for new openings.

He takes up to ten trips a year and a single visit can cost up to £1,500. He has just returned from a two week tour of Asia and is currently in Kazakhstan to visit the chain's new restaurant in Almaty.

Kay visited his first Cafe, aged just eight years old, while in Miami with his parents in 1994.

But it wasn't until a trip to Hong Kong in 1997 that his obsession truly began. 

While on holiday his family chanced upon a local Hard Rock Cafe. 

Inside he noticed a sign for the second restaurant on the island and convinced his parents to take him to the other branch. 

During family holidays he visited branches in London, Florida Key West and Orlando. 

And after finishing school he even got a job with an airline so he could see the world's Cafes without blowing his wages monthly wages.

As a child, his family helped fuel the obsession, bringing him to Key West (left) and San Francisco (right)

On family vacations to London (left) and Orlando (right), Kalkbrenner began collecting key rings at each branch

Since then, he's spent more than £31,000 (€40,000) travelling from his native Germany to exotic Hard Rock locations - where he always buys a key ring.

In just one year, he went to the USA, Mexico, Japan, and on a cruise through the Caribbean, clocking up more than 22 Hard Rock Cafes.

Even when he can't take extended periods off work from his job for a travel company, he spends every weekend travelling around Europe to tick off the restaurants closer to home.

But Kay's favourite branches aren't even in the chain's native United States - he loves the locations in Tenerife, Beirut, Cancun, Seoul and Kuwait.

At his home, he has a room dedicated to his mission including a huge wall map with pins to show every restaurant he has visited, thousands of pictures of him, all of the 1,500 key rings he has purchased and one giant master spreadsheet so he can keep track of all the places he has been.

But even Kay admits that his friends don't understand his obsession and have tried to get him to stop.

In just one year, Kalkbrenner visited over 22 locations - most in the Caribbean - like this Aruba branch

He said: 'Most of my friends don't really understand why I do it and why I spend so much time and money on my hobby.

'I think only other collectors and fans can really understand.

'My family likes my hobby very much - they appreciate that it's helped me come across so many amazing places in the world.'

'I never thought I'll make it to Colombia,' he explained, 'Now I have been there twice already.'

'I'd never even heard about Guam, Saipan, or Kota Kinabalu before. 

'Who knows where the next Hard Rock Cafes will open up but I'll make it my mission to travel there.'

The only downside? 'The food is almost the same everywhere in the world and a bit overpriced,' he admitted.

'The decor and memorabilia is nice to see but for me not so important.

'I don't walk around the cafe and take  pictures of all the memorabilia but I know there are people out there doing that as they're interested in that.

'It's more a chance to see the world that I'm interested in and a chance to tick another Cafe off my list - I'm a collector at heart!'
