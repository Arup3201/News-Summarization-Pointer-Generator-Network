Two Australian DJs who made a hoax phone call to the hospital where Kate Middleton was being treated for morning sickness could be in hiding for months due to ongoing fears for their safety.

Sydney-based 2DayFM radio presenters 
Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII Hospital in London last week in a bid to gain information about the Duchess of Cambridge's condition.

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, unwittingly transferred their call to a colleague who gave the DJs detailed information on the Duchess's health. Ms Saldanha was found hanged days later - leading to worldwide condemnation of the DJs' prank.

Mr Christian and Ms Greig made a
grovelling apology in two interviews aired on Australian TV following 
the death of the nurse, but have had to go into hiding after receiving threats.

At least eight other senior staff
members at the 2Day FM radio station and its parent company, 
SCAustereo, are also under the protection of security guards as they 
remain at a number of secret locations in Sydney and Melbourne.

A radio station source told the Mail today that ‘there are people out there who obviously want to 
cause trouble and no risks are being taken as far as the safety of 
everyone who might have held some responsibility for the hoax is 
concerned.’

What has added to the fears, in the 
wake of a week of hate messages on social media, is a letter sent from 
South Australia and addressed to DJ Michael Christian warning him that 
there was a bullet with his name on it.

It is understood the letter, accompanied by a torrent of foul language, also mentioned a shotgun.

Australian police, who are liaising 
with Scotland Yard as a probe continues into the hoax call, are keeping in close 
contact with radio station executives as a wave of fear runs through the
radio network.

Police are continuing to scour social
media for any sign of further threats – and are watching for fake 
messages on sites that pretend to be sourced from the radio station or 
its staff.

One disrespectful message regarding 
Miss Saldanha and purporting to have been written by SCAustereo chief 
executive officer Rhyss Holleran was dismissed by a company spokeswoman 
yesterday as ‘a total fabrication.’

Sam Kaye told the Mail: ‘This is
clearly a fake, following on from other fake messages that have been 
written by people out to hurt us. Mr Holleran would not be a party to 
anything like this, whether the eyes of the world were on us or not.’

British police are understood to have
asked their Australian counterparts for the names of people who would 
need to be questioned about the radio hoax as part of their inquiries 
into the suicide of nurse Saldanha.

Sydney’s Daily Telegraph today published photos of 10 staff members who were directly, or indirectly, behind the prank call.

As well as the two DJs and Mr Holleran, they include the executive producer of the prank show, Hot30, Emily Mills and Guy Dobson, SCAustreo's head of content.

The body of Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was discovered in her room in staff quarters last Friday. Two notes were found nearby and a third was among her possessions.

The mother of two had also sent a 
number of emails and made telephone calls that police believe might help
explain what happened.

During a five-minute hearing at 
Westminster Coroner’s Court earlier this week it was revealed that attempts were
made to revive the nurse but they were ‘to no avail’.

Scotland Yard detectives are examining
the notes, as well as interviewing Mrs Saldanha’s friends, family and 
colleagues at London’s King Edward VII hospital.

Mrs
Saldanha, a night sister, was the senior nurse on duty when she took a 
call at 5.30am on Tuesday from Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael 
Christian, who were pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles.

She
unwittingly transferred the call to a colleague, who described in 
detail the condition of Kate, who was being treated for severe morning 
sickness.

Mr Harman told the hearing detectives 
had been in contact with colleagues in New South Wales and would be 
taking statements from those involved in the prank call.

Mrs Saldanha, who was born in India, 
lived in London during the week and returned home to Bristol to be with 
her family at weekends.

Mr Barboza and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 
14, had been expecting her home for the weekend and were apparently 
unaware of her role in the hoax call.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has been 
representing the family, said they could expect the results of a 
post-mortem examination within four days.

Southern Cross Austereo, the parent 
company of Sydney-based 2Day FM which broadcast the hoax call, has ended
Greig and Christian’s Hot 30 show and suspended prank calls across the 
company.
