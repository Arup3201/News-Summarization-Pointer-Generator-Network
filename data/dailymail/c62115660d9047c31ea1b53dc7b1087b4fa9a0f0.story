Manchester City scouts watched Alexandre Lacazette during Lyon’s French Cup win at RC Lens on Sunday.

Lacazette continued his good form with another strike that helped Lyon win the game 3-2 and the goal took his tally for this season to 20.

City are continuing to evaluate targets for the the Premier League and for their MLS franchise - New York City FC.

Manchester City sent scouts to watch French forward Alexandre Lacazette over the weekend

Anderlecht's Dennis Praet and Julian Draxler of Schalke have also been discussed, but both are more in mind for the summer.

Another player monitored, Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke, is ready to see out the season at Villa Park.

Christian Benteke is reportedly happy to stay at Aston Villa despite Manchester City's rumoured interest

Paul Lambert's side do have a strong interest in City's Scott Sinclair though, who has also attracted enquiries from QPR and Crystal Palace.

Paul Lambert is interested in raiding fellow Midlands club West Brom for 20-year-old forward Adil Nabi

Sinclair, 25, has become a forgotten man at the Etihad Stadium having made just four substitute appearances this season and is hoping to leave the club this month.

Villa have also made an enquiry for West Brom's 20-year-old forward Adil Nabi who is out of contract in the summer.
