A pedestrian has died after being hit by a police car investigating reports that a disqualified driver was back behind the wheel illegally.

The victim, believed to be in his 40s and called James, was accidentally run down on White Rock, Hastings, a busy road right on the promenade.

The man died at the scene at around 7.20pm yesterday, despite efforts to save him by police officers and paramedics.

The pedestrian was killed instantly in the collision near Hastings pier

The police car involved had been on 
its way to investigate reports that a disqualified driver had been seen 
behind the wheel in the area. This driver has still not been found.

One of the two officers in the car suffered minor cuts from shattered glass but did not need hospital treatment.

Nearby resident Chris Paraskeva, 61, who lives opposite the crash site, witnessed the aftermath of the collision.

Flowers left at the scene identify the victim, believed to be in his 40s, as James. His identity has not been officially confirmed but police are appealing for witnesses

Antiques
 dealer Mr Paraskeva said: 'I returned home five minutes after it 
happened. I could see CPR being carried out on someone.

'There
 was a bus parked further up. There was one police vehicle and then 
others arrived. In total, there were 12 police vehicles.

'They were just working on somebody lying down, then the ambulance arrived, and it went on and on and on for some time.

'It was apparent to me that he was dead not long after the ambulance arrived.'

Two bouquets of flowers were left 
below police signs appealing for witnesses at the scene of the crash, 
just east of the derelict Hastings Pier.

Attached to one bunch was a note which read: 'James, from Clive, Vix, Chloe, Ryan, Jonah.'

A police spokesman said the incident was being referred to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

He said: 'The full circumstances of the incident have yet to be established and it will be referred to the IPCC.'
