Simon Dyson has spoken for the first time since being found guilty of breaking the rules and insisted all his fellow professionals have welcomed him back to the fold.

The Englishman is competing in the Abu Dhabi Championship on Thursday, his first outing since a three-man hearing adjudged he deliberately tapped down a spike mark in the BMW Masters in China last October, and handed out a two month suspended sentence.

‘It has been great. I can’t say enough about my fellow pros. Nobody has said anything and everyone has been coming up and talking to me,’ said the Englishman. As if to prove the point, Rory McIlroy wandered over soon afterwards and embraced Dyson.

Error: Dyson was disqualified from the BMW Masters for tapping down a spike mark on the line of his putt

The 36-year-old is competing here with a renewed love for the game after coming uncomfortably close to losing his livelihood for a period of time. In the end, the three-man hearing decided his dishonesty was a ‘moment of aberration’ rather than ‘premeditated,’ and opted for a heavy fine plus a ban of the suspended variety.

'There was never any intent there whatsoever,’ said Dyson. ‘I’ve never done it in the past and I’ll never do it in the future. There was no intent whatsoever to try to get an advantage. I’m just going to be very careful from now on, make sure I’m on the ball and be very professional about everything I do.'

Dyson resolved to put the matter behind him from the moment he walked out of the hearing early last month. ‘As soon as it was over it was over. That was the way I looked at it. My wife and I have not spoken about it,’ he said. ‘What is in the past is in the past and I can’t do anything about it. I wish I could change what happened but nobody can, and so I just have to get on with it and carry on.’

Perhaps the only good thing about the
 whole sorry saga that left his fellow pros incensed at the time is that
 it reminded Dyson of the charmed life he leads playing professional 
golf for a living.

‘It’s just nice to be back and doing something I love doing,’ said Dyson. ‘There was a good chance it might have been taken away from me for a couple of months if the panel had seen it differently. Now I’m probably as focused as I have ever been. I will get my head down now and try to get back into the world’s top 50.’

Was it the lowest moment of his career? ‘I don’t think you can get any worse, really,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t very nice. To be honest, I hadn’t really been enjoying my golf for a couple of years, I had fallen out of love with it, and then to have it topped off by that was pretty low. But, like I said, it has made me realise I love what I am doing.’

Dyson will begin on Thursday morning in the company of fellow Englishman Mark Foster and Scottish rookie, Jamie McLeary.

The man to beat: Europe's No 1 Henrik Stenson

Henrik Stenson was the first man to secure his place in Europe's Ryder Cup team and the European No 1 plans to be the first to arrive at Gleneagles in September.

Stenson's brilliant form at the end of last season saw him make history by winning the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same year, not to mention gathering enough world ranking points to effectively qualify for the Ryder Cup with nine months to spare.

The 27-year-old, whose last appearance in the event came in 2008, has accrued 240 points, almost 70 more than Martin Kaymer needed in 2012 to secure the final qualifying berth on the world points list.

But he has not played at Gleneagles since 2004, or seen the alterations made in recent years under the supervision of course designer Jack Nicklaus, and will therefore get there as soon as possible after playing in the Tour Championship in Atlanta - assuming he qualifies for the event he won last year.

'It's been quite a few years since I played the Gleneagles tournament,' said Stenson, who shot an opening round of 81 in 2002 as he went through the first of two major career slumps.

'I'm thinking about maybe making my way over a little bit early to get rid of some jet-lag and possibly get another round in before everybody else gets there. That's a more likely scenario than making a trip there while I'm in Scotland because we've got both the Scottish Open and the Open Championship to look after in the summer.'

Stenson begins his 2014 campaign in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship this week, an event he has played every year since it started in 2006 but has yet to win.

'I've got two second places and it's the one tournament down in this part of the world that I haven't won,' the world NO 3 added. 'I managed to win in Dubai in November (at the DP World Tour Championship), the Desert Classic in 2007 and Qatar in 2006.

'It would be a nice one to add to the collection here having made Dubai my home for almost 10 years. It's nice to be back and it's going to be a challenge of course.'
