She's a talented musician in her own right but Camilla Kerslake is also known to some as the glamorous other half of England captain Chris Robshaw.

But the rugby WAG, 26, is also hoping to shake up the opera world this week as she appears in a controversial new production, wearing a vampy floor sweeping Morticia-style dress.

Designed by Francesca Marotta, the slinky gown is made from sheer black lace and is worn with nude lingerie.

Camilla, who lives in London with Chris, said: 'I love the dress, especially the big puffed sleeves.

'They wanted me to go naked underneath, but I refused and we settled on nude underwear.'

Camilla has already forged a career as a talented musician after being spotted by Take That star Gary Barlow in 2009.

Since then she has released an album and sung ahead of England's international matches at Twickenham.

The opera - covering sex, spirituality and plastic surgery and is the creation of composer Toni Castells.

Camilla hopes the new work will make opera 'more mainstream.'

She added: 'In the modern day things like sex, plastic surgery and spirituality need to be addressed.'The classic opera is full of murder and adultery but what we are trying to say is more about modern issues.

'It is basically an expression of human condition and is much more accessible to the average person on the street.

'This is a really exciting way to make opera more mainstream.'

The new opera is called Life From Light and was inspired by a BBC documentary exploring the origins of life on planet Earth.

Two performances of the opera will be given at Kings Place, London, as part of the Opera Festival tomorrow and Friday.
