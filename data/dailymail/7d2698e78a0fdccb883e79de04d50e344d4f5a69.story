A senior member of a notorious South London gang linked to the main suspects in the Woolwich murders has given a vivid insight into their drift towards extremism.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, grew up on the periphery of the Muslim-dominated Woolwich Boys.

The 300-strong group, which controls the local drugs trade and is made up of mostly Somalis, has long been the target of extremists seeking to exploit members’ psychological vulnerability. ‘They see our qualities of passion and heart as attractive,’ said the 22-year-old gang  member, Yousef.

‘Many of the boys come from war-torn communities and have witnessed real pain and suffering and consequently have no fear. At the same time some, like me, will eventually question what they have done, what they are doing with their lives, the hopelessness of it all. When a brother is down I can see it in his eyes.

‘While most do not follow a radical agenda they are still susceptible to the jihad preachers. I have heard about some Woolwich Boys falling victim to these people and going off to fight in places such as Somalia.’

He said Adebowale was linked to the gang in a ‘low-level way’ adding: ‘He wasn’t a hardcore guy; he was quiet and shy. I’ve seen the other Michael wandering around Woolwich as if sleep-walking, but I don’t think he was directly involved. But he was immersed in what was going on around him. You can’t escape it.

‘When I saw him talking on TV with blood on his hands I thought, “You idiot, you fool.” It was like he was a robot who had been activated and another man’s words were coming out of his mouth.’

Yousef described how the two suspects grew up against a backdrop of violence, fear and ‘hopelessness’ and said the crossover between criminal gangs and Islamist groups has increased in recent years.

‘It is easy for preachers to pick off boys. They offer them a way out of violence when they are at their weakest. Many of us, though, like the warmth we get from Islam, the brotherly love. People might find that strange as I’ve led a bad life.

‘But I did operate under certain rules. Never hurt anyone who is innocent and don’t involve children in what we do.’

Notorious: A senior member of the Woolwich Boys, Yousef, has revealed how the Muslim-dominated gang has been targeted by extremists

Growing up in nearby Charlton, Yousef joined the gang at the age of 16. ‘I never knew my father, but if I’d had him in my life it is most likely that I would never have got involved with the Woolwich Boys,’ he said.

Instead, he became rapidly immersed in violence. ‘My thing was robbing drug dealers,’ he said. ‘We’d set up a deal to buy a kilo of skunk [around £6,000]. We’d do this two or three times. Then the next time, once we’d got trust, we’d ask for five kilos – and this is when we’d rob them at knifepoint. Then we’d sell it to the more senior members for between £3,000 and £5,000.

‘At first, the biggest change being in the Woolwich Boys brought to my life was the girls. Girls of 16, 17, 18 – who wouldn’t have looked at me before – were coming up to me saying they wanted to lose their virginity. It was because I was a Woolwich Boy, a respected individual. The girls were mesmerised. Some would go as far as hiding drugs and guns for you.’

By the time he was 19, Yousef was driving a 7-series BMW and earning £4,000 cash a week.  ‘Then things began to change. I lost three friends who were stabbed and shot and it made me question what I was doing. I didn’t want it for my kid brother, I’ve always kept him on a different path. He’s in school and my sister is in college and they are fine.

‘My mum wasn’t pleased when I became a Muslim, she thinks it’s rubbish. But at least she knows I’m too strong-minded to get picked up by the extremists.’
