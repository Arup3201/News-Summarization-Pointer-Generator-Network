The former high school teacher who quit his job and left his family to move in with a student 23 years his junior has been branded a sexual predator by a therapist who interviewed the controversial couple.

James Hooker, 41, and Jordan Powers, 18, made their relationship public last week as it was revealed the pair were moving in together after meeting when Hooker was Jordan's business teacher at James Enochs High School in Modesto, California.

A therapist told ABC that the couple are experiencing a common syndrome called 'shared paranoia'  where they think the whole world is against them.

Forbidden love: Teacher James Hooker, 41, left, with his young love Jordan Powers, 18, for who he left his job and family

Expert opinion: Therapist Bethany Marshall says of James Hooker, 'He is pathologically immature. These teachers imagine themselves to be age mates or peers with the students'

Bethany Marshall said: 'James is pathologically immature. And this is what we see with teachers who
have inappropriate relationships with their students. They imagine 
themselves to be age mates or peers with the students.

'Like most sex predators, he is identified age-wise with the victim. 
This is what you see with pedophilia, with offending patterns, with 
teachers who have sex with students.

'They always talk about the student 
as if they and the student are the exact same age. James 
does what sex offenders often do. He disavows culpability while doing 
the same actions he's saying he's not responsible for.'

The couple insist that nothing inappropriate took place before Jordan turned 18 and a police investigation is currently underway to discern whether or not this is the case.

Meanwhile, Jordan's mother has waged a public 
campaign on Facebook 
alleging Hooker actively pursued her daughter when she was underage 
and said his actions are tantamount to abuse.

Where it all began: James Hooker quit his job at Enochs High School in Modesto - where his daughter, 17, is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with Jordan

Intimate: The couple share a kiss as they are interviewed by ABC and insist their love is real and for life

Hooker's wife and children - including a 17-year-old who goes to the same school the couple met - are now trying to move on with their lives in the wake of the scandal.

When Ms Marshall asked Hooker how he felt about abandoning his family, he accused her of being judgemental saying: 'Love will overcome everything. I love my 
children. I love Jordan. I think that you're making … judgment calls. 
And I think that we'll prove you wrong.'

Both insist their love for each other is real and their relationship will succeed. Ms Marshall told ABC that though it will likely last for a while, eventually one of them will realise the reality of what they are doing.

'They're both dropouts at this point. She's a dropout from school and 
he's a dropout from society. We used to have a diagnosis … called shared
paranoia,' she told the news channel. 'And that's when one person makes another 
person believe that the world is against them.

'When you make another 
person believe that the world is against both of you, you create a very 
powerful bond. This is what we see in cults. And this is what he's 
created with her.'

Concern: Jordan's mother Tammy, right, is accusing Hooker of pursuing her daughter, left, and said what he is doing is tantamount to abuse

Jordan's mother Tammie Powers is blaming Hooker for pursuing her daughter and taking advantage of her.

She claims her daughter's grades fell this year and she started to have panic attacks 'from the stress'.

She told The Bee: 'I was really, really careful. I wanted her to be safe. In hindsight, in retrospect, I should have looked at things differently.

'She looked up to him. He was in the position of an educator, you don’t 
abuse your student. Period.

'She’s still in high school. She still lives 
at home. She has a curfew. That’s not OK.'

Publically naming and shaming Hooker on her Facebook page, Tammie Powers believes Hooker is just like a pedophile and should spent the rest of his life behind bars.

Love nest: Hooker left his wife and children to move into one of these apartments with Jordan - 23 years his junior

On Tannie Powers' Facebook account, she posts a picture of James Hooker with this message:

'This is a picture of JAMES HOOKER from 
Enochs High School....a perverted man in his forties, who has taken 
advantage of a little girl.

'Now, James if you're reading this while you 
have my daughter, you better believe everyone will know you're a sick 
child molester.

'Don't 
think for one second you will win. I'm smarter, stronger, and 
way more determined. I WILL NEVER give up.

'I'll be getting my daughter back you 
sicko.'

Jordan has now stopped attending classes at the school and is doing independent study.

She insists that they did nothing wrong until she became an adult and that feelings gradually developed.

Mrs Powers does not believe these claims. She discovered up to 8,000 text messages exchanged between them, emails and late night phone calls.

She has now even started a Facebook campaign against Hooker, calling him a 'sicko' and a 'pervert'

Mr Hooker said, though he is being investigated, he is confident that he will be cleared of any inappropriate behaviour, but said he can see why people would be alarmed.

He told ABC: 'I think the stigma of the teacher-student relationship just makes it messy, makes it really hard for people to get through to the point that we really do like each other.

'We really do want to have a future together.'
