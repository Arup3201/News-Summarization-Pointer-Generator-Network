Elderly pornographer Larry Flynt  is 71 years old, but he's proving he can still hustle around Los Angeles. 

Mr Flynt was spotted rolling to Mother's Day dinner at Beverly Hills hotspot The Ivy with his fifth wife Elizabeth Berrios on Sunday.

Thirty years ago, the Hustler magazine founder was sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell for a satirical cartoon that said the televangelist had his first sexual encounter with his mother - in an outhouse.

Out and about: Larry Flynt enjoys Mother's Day at The Ivy restaurant in Beverly Hills, California

Flynt's wife, Elizabeth Berrios, leaned in for a tender kiss with the aging pornographer

Flynt married Berrios in 1998 after the death of his fourth wife Althea Flynt. She was once his nurse

Now he's honoring Mother's Day with a rare public appearance.

The Ivy is not just another restaurant. It's one of the top places in LA for tourists and photographers to see celebrities - and for celebrities to be seen. 

Photographs show Mr Flynt - the founder of Hustler Magazine - being wheeled into the restaurant by a bodyguard.

He seemed to eschew his traditional power wheel-chair for a simpler design.

By his side was fifth wife Elizabeth Berrios. She was once his nurse. He married her in 1998.

He married her, then divorced - then married her again after his fourth wife, Althea Flynt, drowned in her bathtub in 1976.

Flynt clearly enjoyed the affection from his younger bride. He recently said he still maintains a sex life thanks to penile implants

Mr Flynt has been confined to a wheelchair since 1976, when he was wounded by a white supremacist gunman. The bullets damaged his spine.

He revealed last February that he still has an active sex life - thanks to a penile implant he received. 

Mr Flynt says he is estranged from all but one of his five children - claiming they only want his money and have no interest in his business empire.

Despite Hustler magazine falling dramatically in circulation from its peak of 3million - and dramatically more competition from internet pornography - Mr Flynt claims his smut empire still brings in $100million a year.
