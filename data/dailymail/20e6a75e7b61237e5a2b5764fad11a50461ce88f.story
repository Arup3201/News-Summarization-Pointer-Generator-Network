A flag collector has sparked fury by hoisting a Nazi swastika up a 20ft pole outside his home – before claiming he did not know what it represented.

Martin Baker, 53, flew the red and black Waffen SS flag at the front of his house in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on Friday night - before taking it down hours later on Saturday morning.

Now, Mr Baker - who has more than 100 flags in his collection and has been flying them outside his home for seven years - has apologised and admitted he was ‘still not sure what the flag means’.

Collector: Mr Baker (pictured with his 53-year-old wife Sharon) - who has been flying flags outside his home for seven years - has apologised and admitted he was 'still not sure what the flag means'

He said: ‘I don’t want to upset anyone so I took it down as soon as people started contacting me explaining about the fuss it was causing. I am not part of any right-wing group, I’m not a fascist.

‘It is nothing like that at all. It is all down to me being ignorant and I can’t apologise enough. I took it down straight away. I just want to put the record straight.

‘There was no motive behind it, it was purely down to my ignorance as to what it represented then and what it represents now. I am still not sure what the flag means.’

Mr Baker, who lives with his wife Sharon, 53, began his flag fascination in 2008 by putting up a pole outside his £280,000 detached four-bedroom house after a local garage was disposing of them.

Home: Mr Baker has collected and displayed a wide variety of flags representing different countries

Original idea: The Leeds United season ticket holder had initially planned to use the flagpole to fly a flag showing his support for the football club

The Leeds United season ticket holder had initially planned to use the flagpole to fly a flag showing his support for the Championship football club.

But since then he has started collecting and displaying a wide variety of flags representing different countries and causes - including military and country flags.

Mr Baker added: ‘I bought the flag on the internet and I will now be getting rid of it. I normally fly flags on a two-week cycle, but I am not putting any more up for a while.

‘The next one I put up will say love, peace and happiness on it. I will be more careful next time.’

Mr Baker said none of the flags he had flown before had ever landed him in hot water.

The Waffen-SS, which existed between 1933 and 1945, was the combat arm of the Nazi party's Schutzstaffel - and condemned at the Nuremberg Trials as being part of a criminal organisation.
