Charged: Bill Roache leave Preston magistrates court after a brief preliminary hearing today

Coronation Street actor Bill Roache vowed to 'vigorously protest his innocence' as he arrived at court today to face new sex abuse charges.

His lawyer said the actor finds the allegations 'deeply upsetting' in a statement.

Roache, 81, was last night charged with sexually assaulting another four girls, one as young as 11. He was re-arrested yesterday, a month after he was charged with twice raping a schoolgirl in 1967.

Speaking outside Preston Magistrate's Court, the actor's lawyer Brian Russell said that the new charges were made after fresh 'victims' came forward in the last month.

'Yesterday, Mr Roache was interviewed at length in the police station, and as you know was then charged with five offences of indecent assault,' said Mr Russell.

'These allegations arose out of the publicity which was generated when Mr Roache was interviewed on May 1 for offences of rape.

'So during two lengthy police interviews,Mr Roache has fully co-operated with all the questions that police have had for him in relation to these matters.'

The lawyer added that Roache will fight the case 'vigorously'.

'We expect that later this year, or possibly early next year, a jury will be asked to consider whether Mr Roache is guilty or not guilty of those charges,' he said.

'Mr Roache looks forward to standing before that jury where he will vigorously protest his innocence against what he regards as deeply upsetting allegations made against him.'

The new allegations against Roache, who has played Ken Barlow over six decades, are claimed to have happened in the Manchester area between 1965 and 1968.

Roache was later bailed to appear at 
Preston Crown Court on Monday, when he is due to face an earlier charge 
of raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967.

During
the hearing, he exchanged greetings with Lona Smith, chair of the bench
of magistrates, before he gave his full name - William Patrick Roache -
his address, date of birth and the name of his legal representative.

The court clerk then proceeded to outline the details of the five fresh charges which were made yesterday.

Mr Russell interrupted her to state: 'I indicate they are not guilty pleas.'

The
dates of the alleged indecent assaults in the Manchester area and the 
names of the four alleged victims - who cannot be named for legal 
reasons - were then read out.

Two
counts relate to a girl aged under 16 in 1965, one to a 16-year-old in 
1965, one to a girl aged under 16 in 1968 and one to a girl under 13 in 
1968.

Bill Roache will 'vigorously protest his innocence' when his sex abuse case goes before a jury, his lawyer said today.

Speaking outside Preston magistrates' court, Mr Russell said: 'Yesterday Mr Roache was interviewed at length at the police station and, as you know, was then charged with five offences of indecent assault.

'These allegations arose out of the publicity that was generated when Mr Roache was interviewed on May 1 for offences of rape.

'So during two lengthy police interviews Mr Roache has fully co-operated with all the questions that the police have had for him in relation to these matters.

'Today we expect those cases to be transferred to the Crown Court and there will be another appearance of a short nature on Monday.

'We expect that later this year, or possibly early next year, a jury will be asked to consider whether Mr Roache is guilty or not guilty of those charges.

'Mr Roache looks forward to standing before that jury where he will vigorously protest his innocence against what he regards as deeply upsetting allegations made against him.

'Ladies and gentlemen, I can't go into any more detail, it would be inappropriate at this stage.'

Joanna White, prosecuting, said the eldest alleged victim was 16, one was 14, one was aged 13 or 14 at the time and the other was 11 or 12.

She added the above matters were not suitable for summary trial before magistrates with a possible sentence of up to 18 months in prison for such an offence.

Roache is one of the best-known stars to be held over child sex allegations in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

His friend Stuart Hall, the disgraced BBC TV presenter, is due to be sentenced later this month after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

One was aged just nine when she was molested by the It’s a Knockout host.

The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday three of the new offences allegedly committed by Roache took place in 1965 and two in 1968.

Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor 
for CPS North West, said: ‘We have carefully considered all the evidence
gathered by Lancashire Police in relation to recent allegations from 
four complainants that William Roache indecently assaulted them in the 
1960s.

‘Having completed 
our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it 
is in the public interest for Mr Roache to be charged with five offences
of indecent assault relating to four girls who were aged between 11 or 
12 and 16 at the time that the alleged offences happened.

‘We
have been reviewing evidence and providing early investigative advice 
to Lancashire Police regarding these allegations, which were made to 
police after Mr Roache was charged with two offences of rape on 1 May 
2013.’

Roache – the world’s
longest-serving soap actor – has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap 
since its launch, but will not be appearing in the programme until legal
proceedings are concluded.

Charged: Roache has been charged with five indecent assaults against four girls aged between 11 or 12 and 16

Fans of the soap were stunned when 
the twice-married star was taken into custody following a raid at his 
home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, last month and charged with twice raping a 
15-year-old girl in 1967 when he was 35 and married to his first wife.

In a statement issued by his lawyers 
after he was charged with those offences, he said he 'strenuously' denies the allegations and vowed to fight 'to preserve my 
innocence in the challenging times ahead'.

In March, Roache issued a public 
apology after he claimed in a TV interview that sex abuse victims 
brought it upon themselves and were being punished for sins in a past 
life.

He also called for the same anonymity
for those accused of child sex offences as alleged victims are given 
until conviction because of the stigma they faced even if subsequently 
found innocent.

Off air: Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was charged with 19 sexual offences against a child. His charges are not connected to William Roache's charges

Fellow Coronation Street star Michael
Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air 
after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including 
rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

He denies the charges, which
are not linked to Roache.

Roache’s marriage to his first wife, Anna, ended in divorce in 1974. His second wife Sara died in 2009.

Earlier this year it was revealed he 
ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so 
he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of 
the Pure Love Movement, a religious group.

Last month, the Mail revealed that 
comedian Jim Davidson is being investigated by Yewtree officers over 
claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 
1980s during a concert tour.

The attack is alleged to have 
happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining British 
troops stationed there after the Falklands conflict.

Davidson, 59, was originally arrested
in January of this year over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies 
all the allegations. Other arrested celebrities include entertainer Rolf
Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr.

Disgraced pop star Glitter has also been detained. They all deny any wrongdoing.

PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls.

The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’.

Critics claim the Yewtree investigation has become a celebrity witch-hunt. But Yard chiefs insist it is fair and proportionate.

At least one more celebrity is expected to face criminal charges in the coming weeks.

Detained: Chris Denning helped launch Gary Glitter's career

A former Radio 1 DJ has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Chris Denning, 72, was detained at a hostel in East London by officers working on Operation Yewtree.

Scotland Yard said the suspect, whom they have not formally named, was questioned on suspicion of sexual offences.

Yesterday it emerged that the arrested man was Denning and that he was quizzed over ‘historic allegations’.

It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague.

Denning was one of the original Radio 1 DJs alongside Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart and John Peel when the station launched in 1967.

Denning later helped launch the career of Gary Glitter.

He lived overseas but recently has been staying at a hostel for the homeless which the Mail is not identifying for legal reasons.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
