One of the last letters penned on board the Titanic recalling the 'wonderful' journey has resurfaced after 102 years.

The message, written on Titanic headed notepaper, was written just hours before the doomed liner stuck an iceberg and sank on Sunday, April 14 1912 with the loss of 1,522 lives.

It was due to be posted by Esther Hart after the ship docked but was kept by the author, who survived the disaster along with her young daughter Eva.

A letter written by Esther Hart (right) and her daughter Eva, aged seven at the time (centre), is thought to be the last surviving correspondence written on board the Titanic on the day it sank. Benjamin Hart (left) lost his life, when he went down with the ship on Sunday, April 14 1912

The note is the only known surviving letter written on the fateful day, when the ship sank on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic.

It is now set to sell for £100,000 at auction.

Mrs Hart, whose husband Benjamin died on board, going down with the ship, wrote to her mother back in England on the day tragedy struck.

She said: 'The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage up to now. There has been no tempest. It is very nice weather but awfully windy and cold.'

Mrs Hart tells her mother how the ship was expected to arrive in New York 12 hours ahead of schedule due to the speed it was travelling at - one of the factors that resulted in the ship colliding with the iceberg.

And she told how her seven-year-old daughter sang her favourite hymn ‘Oh God our help in ages past’ in the church service that morning.

She said: 'She sang out loudly, she is very bonny.'

Seven-year-old Eva left her own message at the end for her grandmother. She wrote: 'Heaps of love and kisses to all from Eva xxxx'

Mrs Hart, from Ilford, Essex, also 
revealed an onboard concert in aid of the Sailors’ Home in Southampton 
that was due to take place the following night.

And she apologised for her handwriting being ‘a screw’ as it was due to the Titanic rolling and ‘shakes my arm’.

Eva wrote a short note at the foot of the second page which read: 'Heaps of love and kisses to all from Eva.'

After the Titanic struck the iceberg in the north Atlantic, Benjamin Hart, a second class passenger, woke his wife and daughter and guided them to lifeboat 14.

He told his Eva to hold ‘mummy’s hand and be a good girl’ and that he would see them soon. His body, if recovered, was never identified.

The letter was found in the pocket of Benjamin’s sheepskin coat which he gave to his wife to keep warm.

When Esther arrived in New York with Eva she sent a cable to her parents to confirm they were safe but her husband was missing.

Eva Hart became one of the most well-known survivors of Titanic, mainly because of her outspoken criticism of White Star Line for failing to provide enough lifeboats.

Eva Hart was seven years old when she survived the sinking of the Titanic

My dear ones all,

As you see it is Sunday afternoon and we are meeting in the library after luncheon.

I was very bad all day yesterday, could not eat or drink, and sick all the while, but today I have got over it.

This morning Eva and I went to church and she was so pleased they sang Oh Lord Our Help In Ages Past, that is the hymn she sang so nicely, so she sang out loud, she is very bonny.

She has had a nice ball and a box of toffee and a photo of this ship bought her today, everybody takes notice of her ... the teddy bear.

There is to be a concert on board tomorrow night in aid of the Sailors Home and she is going to singg, so am I.

The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage, up to now there has been no tempest, but God knows what it must be. 

When there is one, this roughly expanse of water, no land in sight and the ship rolling from side to side is very wonderful tho they say this ship does not roll on account of its size.

Anyhow it rolls enough for me, I shall never forget it. It is nice weather but awfully windy and cold.They say we may get into New York Tuesday night but we were really due early on Wednesday morning.

Shall write as soon as we get there, this letter won't leave the ship but will remain for me back to England where she is due again on the 26th where you see the letter all of a screw is when she rolls and shakes my arm. I am sending you on a menu to show you how we live, I shall be looking forward to a line from somebody to cheer one up a bit.

I am always shutting my eyes and I see everything as I left it, I hope you are all quite well. Let this be an all sound letter as I can't write properly to all till I can set my foot on shore again.

We have met some nice people on board and so it has been nice so far. But oh the long, long days and nights its the longest week I ever spent in my life.

I must close now with all our fondest love to all of you,From your loving EstHeaps of love and kisses to all from Eva xxxxxx

The letter was intended for Mrs Hart's mother, Mrs Bloomfield, who lived in Chadwell Heath

The message is thought to be the last surviving letter written on the fateful day, Sunday, April 14 1912, when the Titanic, pictured setting sail from Southampton, collided with an iceberg and sank, with the loss of 1,522 lives

The two-page letter is now being sold by auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, on behalf of a private collector who bought it from the Hart family around 20 years ago.

Andrew Alrdidge, of the auction house, said: 'We have sold a number of letters and postcards that were posted by Titanic passengers at Queenstown in Ireland - the last stop before it crossed the Atlantic.

'But this is the only known letter written on Titanic stationary on board on that fateful day.

'The importance of this document cannot be overstated. It is quite simply the jewel in the crown of Titanic manuscript ephemera.

'The letter and envelope are in remarkable condition and the content of it is excellent as it gives a taste of what life was like on board.'

At the time of the Titanic disaster the Hart family were emigrating to Winnipeg, Canada, where they were going to run a chemists.

But Mrs Hart and her daughter Eva returned to England to live in Chadwell Heath, east London.

Mrs Hart died in 1928 aged 65. Eva went on to become a magistrate and died in 1996 aged 91.

The auction takes place on April 26.
