A 24-hour White Castle location on the Las Vegas Strip that opened to long lines of the burger chain's fans had to close for more than two hours to restock after its grand opening. 

The burger slider chain's first location in Las Vegas opened to much fanfare on Tuesday afternoon shortly after 2pm, with customers waiting in line for two hours.

The 24-hour joint was so inundated with burger lovers that it sent out a message on social media around 12.45pm on Wednesday that it would be taking a two-hour hiatus.

The restaurant reopened at about 3.15pm on Wednesday after its initial feeding frenzy. 

 The first ten people in line had been promised 'castle cash' to spend on their sliders. 

Jamie Richardson, White Castle VP, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the store sold 4,000 sliders per hour in the first 12 hours of opening. 

He said that he was not aware of a White Castle ever closing in the chain's 94-year history because of such intense demand. 

He added that the location had not closed because it ran out of burgers but simply to do a little maintenance.  

The restaurant tweeted on Wednesday: 'The #WhiteCastleVegas doors are open and we're back in business. Thank you Vegas for your patience! Let's #EAT.'

The nearest location had been more than 1,500 miles away in Missouri, The Las Vegas Sun reported.

White Castle is in the Best Western Plus Casino Royale on the Las Vegas Strip in between The Venetian and Harrah's Las Vegas. 

The chain opened their first restaurants in Wichita, Kansas in 1921.
