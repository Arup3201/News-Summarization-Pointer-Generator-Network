The BBC is a profligate and inept organisation that has lost public trust after a series of scandals, MPs will say today.

In a landmark report, the MPs paint a devastating picture of an organisation that has blown millions and tries to be ‘all things to all people’.

Bosses are also accused of blaming others for their blunders and showing ‘a mind-set completely out of kilter with public sector principles’.

The MPs, who sit on the Commons culture committee, say the £145.50-a-year licence fee is anachronistic and failure to pay it should no longer be a criminal offence.

Dark past: Former BBC star Jimmy Savile in 2006 with Helen Boaden, now Director of BBC Radio

Their 166-page report, Future of the BBC, says the corporation has squandered hundreds of millions of pounds, handing out sky-high pay-offs to sacked staff and wasting massive sums on vanity projects.

And they highlight a ‘bleak period’ in the 1970s and 1980s when presenters including Jimmy Savile carried out scores of sex attacks, including rapes, on BBC premises.

‘We do not see a long-term future for the licence fee in its current form,’ the report concludes. 

Under fire: Tony Hall, current Director-General of the corporation. The BBC has been heavily criticised in the 166-page report, called 'The Future of the BBC'

To be presented in Parliament this afternoon, it recommends that:

Last night John Whittingdale, who chairs the committee, said: ‘When an organisation is in receipt of nearly £4billion of public money, very big questions have to be asked about how that money is provided and spent, and how that organisation is governed and made accountable.

‘In the short term, there appears to be no realistic alternative to the licence fee, but that model is becoming harder and harder to justify and sustain.’

The Tory MP said the corporation made a valuable contribution to public life, but that it needed to examine its size and scope, and cut certain services. 

Critical: Conservative MP John Whittingdale said that while tje corporation made a valuable contribution to public life, it needed to examine its size and scope, and cut certain services

He added: ‘The BBC has tried for too long to be all things to all people – with the rapid changes in communication and media technology and markets and changing audience needs and behaviours, this no longer works. 

'It should tailor its output to what it does best, and not stray into areas that can and should be left to commercial providers to do well.

BRITAIN risks losing the ‘global information war’ as the BBC World Service is out-gunned by foreign state-backed broadcasters.

MPs said the corporation’s long-established foreign arm could struggle to compete against other networks because of changes to its structure and funding.

‘At a time when countries like Russia and China are increasing their investment in media, including services aimed at the UK, we believe that the World Service has an increasingly important role in what is a global information war,’ their report said. ‘Given its new funding and oversight arrangements, we fear the importance of the World Service could be diminished.’

Until last April, the World Service received a separate grant from the Foreign Office – but the foreign arm is now funded by the licence fee.

‘It is pointless and wasteful having an organisation receiving that kind of public funding competing with – and potentially crowding out – other providers.’

Anyone watching programmes when they are broadcast requires a television licence, regardless of whether they use a TV or a computer. 

However, there is no legal requirement to pay for watching the same programmes online on catch-up services such as iPlayer after they have aired.

The MPs call for urgent changes that would force people to pay for the iPlayer service, for example by blocking non-subscribers.

The corporation must ‘prepare itself’ for the licence fee to be abolished altogether in the 2020s, the report says. 

The levy should be replaced by a flat-rate charge, payable by all households.

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘This report confirms the importance of the BBC in national life and recommends maintaining and modernising the licence fee, something we have said is necessary.

‘We’re grateful to the committee for endorsing our record for efficiency and maintaining the quality of programmes and services, and note members overwhelmingly voted against moving to a subscription funding model.’

The BBC Trust said it was ‘seeking to address’ some of the problems highlighted in the report.

The committee took evidence over two years from former BBC bosses and from the public.

SEND IN THE AUDITORS TO CUT DOWN ON WASTE: MPs say public have lost faith in bosses because of spending scandals

The National Audit Office must be given unfettered access to the ‘profligate’ BBC’s books to ensure it isn’t squandering public money, say MPs.

A succession of spending scandals has ‘dented’ public faith in the broadcaster, their report said, and confidence needs restoring..

Expensive: Broadcasting House in London now costs £89million a year to run – a third of the cost of running the total BBC estate – yet it houses just a fifth of its staff

The NAO has already censured the BBC over the £2billion it has spent on three costly building projects, including its £1billion London headquarters, which was delayed by four years and went £107million over budget. 

Broadcasting House now costs £89million a year to run – a third of the cost of running the total BBC estate – yet it houses just a fifth of its staff. 

THE BBC should own up to its mistakes and end a culture where bosses try to blame others for their errors, the report claims.

 It says the Corporation is ‘beset by problems of its own making’, but instead of dealing with them openly, its senior managers point the finger at other people.

‘[There have been] notable failures and underperformance in certain areas which the BBC has not always been ready to acknowledge until well after the fact,’ it said.

The BBC and the BBC Trust should also stop attempting to bury information that could cast the Corporation in a negative light, it added.

‘In our view, the BBC Trust and the BBC Executive have often tended to highlight favourable performance figures over the less favourable...The BBC should aim to be a better, more transparent, self-critic.’

Meanwhile, the Corporation has written off nearly £100million on a Digital Media Initiative technology project, so badly mismanaged that director general Tony Hall decided to scrap it three years in.

The BBC’s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, also squandered public funds.

In 2007, it bought the travel publisher Lonely Planet in a deal worth £130million. 

However, it failed to make a success of the business, and sold it off at an £80 million loss six years later.

The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said: ‘The Digital Media Initiative was found to have been mismanaged on a large scale and was dropped having delivered few benefits at a loss of £100million.

‘BBC Worldwide’s move into risky commercial activities, not in line with the BBC’s core public service remit, led to a similar loss.’

It added: ‘Given the financial problems in the current charter period which dented the BBC’s reputation, the NAO must now be given unrestricted access to the BBC if it is to provide assurance that the Corporation is spending money wisely and trading fairly.’

MPs also slammed the BBC over the £369million in pay-offs it has handed to departing staff.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The NAO already has extensive access to the BBC’s affairs and recently produced a report commending the savings we have made on our properties.’
