Michael Winner was one of the world’s greatest bon viveurs.

So when his tombstone was unveiled last week, it was always going to have a fitting epitaph.

‘Never a loser be, only a winner he’, the inscription read.

The fitting tombstone epitaph to the late film director was unveiled at a Jewish ceremony in Willesden, London

Family and close friends of the late film director gathered last Friday for the unveiling at an intimate Jewish ceremony.

Winner, who directed the Death Wish series, died aged 77 in January 2013 after battling liver disease.

Broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson, songwriter Don Black and set designer Crispian Sallis – who worked for Winner from the age of 17 and designed the granite headstone – joined his wife Geraldine to unveil it at Willesden Jewish Cemetery.

Sir Michael, 79, said: ‘You either loved him or you hated him and I loved him. He could have a row with anyone but he was an irreverent, funny and challenging man. We had a long and important friendship.’ 

Rabbi Lee Sunderland, who led the service, said: ‘The word headstone in Hebrew means the same as signpost or bus stop.’ 

He explained that the stone was there to give friends and family ‘direction’ and ‘inspiration’ from Winner’s achievements.

Geraldine said: ‘It was a lovely ceremony.’

Barry McKay, a retired music publisher and Winner’s friend, said: ‘Michael was quite an entertainer in his own right and a terrific character.

‘He accumulated a substantial fortune through the exercise of unique talents, hard work and special skills ... in a very competitive world. 

'When he chose his beneficiaries he did so with the intent to deliver, which he did. The facts are that all of Michael’s bequests were more than covered by the close to £50million of assets (before tax and his famous Coutts overdraft) that he left behind.’

Winner formed the Police Memorial Trust in May 1984 after being moved by the death of officer Yvonne Fletcher in St James’s Square, London.

A service held in his honour at the National Police Memorial in June last year was attended by more than 500 people – including Sir Roger Moore and Sir Michael Caine.
