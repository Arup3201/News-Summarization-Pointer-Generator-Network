Genevieve Hippisley was at her home late one night when her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Nolan showed up

This is the woman at the centre of a love triangle that saw one of the Queen’s riders brutally attack a former PR director of the Jockey Club.

Genevieve Hippisley, 26, was at her new home late one night when her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Nolan showed up and caught one of his friends there.

Nolan, 32, a work rider for the Queen’s trainer Sir Michael Stoute, had been living with Miss Hippisley in Newmarket, but she ended their relationship and moved out.

When he paid an unannounced visit to her new flat in the town on July 21, he was shocked to find his friend John Maxse, 45, with her.

Nolan attacked Mr Maxse and left him with a suspected broken eye socket, broken collarbone and broken nose. Appearing at Ipswich Crown Court, Nolan pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent.

Judge Rupert Overbury told him: ‘Be under no illusion that the likely prospect is that you will be going to prison.’ He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Nolan claimed he acted in self-defence. Andrew Shaw, defending, added: ‘Mr Nolan is absolutely adamant that he was not aware that Mr Maxse was at the address when he went there.’ 

Mr Maxse, a former jockey, is a prominent figure in horse racing, working as PR director for the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club. He now works as a consultant for Qatar Racing.

He also rides out for trainer Michael Bell, for whom Miss Hippisley is a work rider.

It is thought  Mr Maxse knew Miss Hippisley through his friendship with Nolan, but the pair became closer at Mr Bell’s yard. Nolan is a work rider at Sir Michael’s Freemason Lodge Stables.

He used to ride the Queen’s horse Carlton House when it was trained there.

Since the attack Mr Maxse and Miss Hippisley have exchanged flirty Twitter messages.

Mr Maxse has been seen with injuries such as a black eye, thought to have been caused by the attack

After Mr Maxse, who has been seen with a black eye and a number of cuts and bruises on his face, joked on the  site that he looked like film character Rocky Balboa, she replied ‘a bit harsh on Sylvester (Stallone)’.

‘Peut-etre. But life generally is unfair,’ he responded. Nolan will be sentenced in September. He was granted conditional bail but cannot go within 100 metres of Miss Hippisley’s home.

As he left court on Thursday he declined to comment. Mr Maxse and Miss Hippisley were last night unavailable for comment.
