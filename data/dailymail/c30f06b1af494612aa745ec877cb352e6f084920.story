Adnan Januzaj was handed his first Premier League start of the season as Manchester United drew 2-2 with West Brom - and the Belgian had some new pearly white boots for the occasion.

The 19-year-old burst on the scene under former boss David Moyes last season but has found himself on the fringes so far this term under Louis van Gaal.

After five substitute appearances in the league, Januzaj was handed a chance to impress the Dutchman in his favoured No 10 role as he started alongside Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria in attack.

Stephane Sessegnon’s ninth minute stunner gave West Brom a surprise lead with a finish that was as striking as Januzaj’s new boots - before goals from Marouane Fellaini, Saido Berahino and Daley Blind saw the match finish level.

The all-white number appears to be that of Warrior’s Speedheat boot.

Januzaj has been pictured wearing the £115 boots at Manchester United’s Carrington HQ after making the switch from his previous Nike Mercurial Superfly boots (as worn by former Old Trafford favourite, Cristiano Ronaldo).

American sports brand Warrior are the kit suppliers to United’s arch-rivals Liverpool and they kit out Stoke City, too.

Although a boot deal has not been made official, Januzaj looks set to join compatriot Vincent Kompany in the Warrior stable.

The Manchester City captain is the boot firm’s key player. Liverpool’s Kolo Toure also wears them, as does Januzaj’s fellow Belgian and United team-mate Marouane Fellaini.

Januzaj will be hoping he does enough to warrant a stay in Van Gaal’s starting XI... or else he might face the boot!
