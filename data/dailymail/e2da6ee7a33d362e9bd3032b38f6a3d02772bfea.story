In an era when supporters seem more distanced from their  heroes than ever, it's refreshing to see Villarreal give one fan an experience many football followers only get to dream about.

The Spanish top-flight club took on Celtic in a recent friendly, but in their starting XI they named 13-year-old Gohan, who sadly suffers from an aggressive form of cancer.

Gohan had informed his nurses of his dream to play for Villarreal at the Madrigal Stadium, and the club were more than happy to oblige.

Villarreal even threw in the full VIP treatment as Gohan got to meet the side in the dressing room before the game, where he even had his own space and player board behind him.

The night would only get better for the 13-year-old, who scored straight from kick-off after showing a few tricks (and judging by Celtic's woeful showing in Europe this term, we reckon his goal was not the result of generosity from the Scottish champions.)

Having celebrated his strike with his team-mates, Gohan was substituted to warm applause from the fans soon after as the Spanish outfit went on to win the game 5-2.

The two teams have joined forces for charity in recent years to raise both funds and awareness for child cancer sufferers.

Former Villarreal player Ernesto Boixader lost his son to the disease before a UEFA Cup against Celtic game 10 years ago and was so taken back by the generosity from the Scottish side's fans, he decided to work on the Submari Celtic Supporters’ Club, who have since raised nearly £120,000 in the name of charity.
