Jose Mourinho launched preparations for Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid with a game of bluff around Petr Cech’s fitness.

Cech dislocated his shoulder during the goalless first leg and Mourinho confirmed last week the goalkeeper will require surgery to help repair the right shoulder joint.

It is a routine procedure but one which would normally rule a player out for around three months, so it was a surprise to see Chelsea's No 1 among the first players out for Tuesday’s session at their training ground in Surrey.

Big guns: Samuel Eto'o and Eden Hazard were back in training despite being doubts for the game

When asked if he was fit, he smiled 
and said: 'of course,' but he looked far from comfortable in his range of
 movement as he limbered up with the rest of the squad.

The
 big Czech goalkeeper could not lift his arms above his head and held
 his right arm close to his body for stability as he went through the 
gentlest of jogging exercises.

When
 goalkeepers Mark Schwarzer, Henrique Hilario and Mitchell Beeney broke 
off to do their work with goalkeeping coach Christophe Lollichon, Cech 
sat it out.

He could be seen kicking a ball against a nearby goalpost as Lollichon worked the other three intensively.

There
 were rumours last week that Cech might be convinced to delay surgery 
until after the end of the season in the hope he may be fit enough to 
play if Chelsea were to reach the Champions League final on May 24, 
against Bayern Munich or Real Madrid.

When
 asked directly about this in his press conference on Friday, Mourinho 
shrugged and said he did not know but the club is not likely to take a 
risk with such an important asset as their No 1 goalkeeper.

Schwarzer
 remains most likely to continue in goal. The 41-year-old Aussie, on 
course to become the oldest player to appear in a European Cup final, 
has yet to concede since coming off the bench to replace Cech in Madrid.

He
 performed well at Liverpool on Sunday when a weakened Chelsea blew the 
Barclays Premier League title race wide open by beating the leaders 2-0.

Chelsea’s
 other fitness doubts were all present at Tuesday’s training session. John
 Terry, who twisted an ankle in Madrid last week, appeared happy and at 
ease as he trained.

Eden 
Hazard, who has not played since tweaking a calf muscle in the second 
leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, also
 seemed to be moving freely.

Chelsea
 have been cautious with Hazard, wary that the slight injury might 
develop into something more serious but the 17-goal Belgian, voted PFA 
Young Player of the Year, has been such a key part of Mourinho’s 
attacking plans this season that he is expected to play at Stamford 
Bridge tomorrow.

Samuel Eto’o who has missed the last two games with a minor knee injury was also fit to train and could return to lead the line.

Mourinho
 knows his team will have to score if they are to reach their third 
Champions League final. Eto’o has scored 12 this season, all at home.
