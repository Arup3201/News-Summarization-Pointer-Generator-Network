Ashley Parkes (above) sent a fake bomb to the manager of a Boots store on the anniversary of the 7/7 London terror attacks last year. He was given a suspended sentence for 18 months at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday

A Boots worker who sent a fake bomb to a store on the anniversary of the 7/7 London terror attacks has been spared jail.

Ashley Parkes attached a chilling note to the rectangular package, which read: 'Handle with care - bombs explode.'

Police were alerted and a store in Leeds, where the parcel was delivered last year, was evacuated until experts examined the package. 

They quickly discovered it was a hoax and only contained hair dye and blue tissue paper, Nottingham Crown Court was told.

The 26-year-old, who worked in a Boots warehouse at the time, admitted dispatching a parcel with the intention of inducing a belief that it was likely to explode or ignite and cause personal injury or damage to property.

He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Michael Stokes QC , sentencing, said: 'Sending you immediately to prison would perhaps misrepresent the seriousness of what you did.

'In the present day society anybody who produces a package and even pretends it is a bomb is creating a great deal of trouble and potential risk to innocent people. 

'It had been a pathetic attempt by Parkes but it still resulted in a store being evacuated and a great deal of public expense and inconvenience to a large number of people.'

Julia King, prosecuting, told the court Parkes sent the hoax bomb after seeing a film on YouTube of gravestones being desecrated.

She said: 'It affected him and that was why he acted in the way he did.'

Ms King added that the manager had been left shocked and nervous after the incident.

The court heard Parkes, of Bestwood, Nottingham, has mild learning difficulties and is on medication for depression.

Steven Gosnell, defending, acknowledged it was a peculiar case and said Parkes was never intending to cause injury.

He said: 'Parkes, who lost his job, did what he did on the spur of the moment and has apologised.'
