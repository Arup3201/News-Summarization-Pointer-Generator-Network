Photoshoots are complicated at the best of times. You often have little time to get the perfect shot and there are so many moving parts. So imagine throwing 99 primary school children into the mix. And then deciding to put them all in England shirts surrounding Wayne Rooney. This was going to be a challenge.

Putting the kids in shirts rather than caps – as we did when we took a similar picture for Steven Gerrard’s 100th cap – was a fairly late decision. That gave us just a couple of days to find and get 99 shirts to Liverpool. Of course we wanted the kids to be able to keep them too.

A big thanks goes to Pro-Direct Soccer for providing the Nike England kits for the shoot. For more info go to www.prodirectsoccer.com 

We tried a lot of shops but getting the right sizes and delivery in time proved impossible. We needed half red and half white too to make the perfect picture and that was an added challenge. 

Step in, Pro Direct Soccer at the last minute with a phone call that rescued the shoot and stopped us from having to disappoint the brilliant people at Our Lady and Saint Swithin's Catholic Primary School – and Rooney.

They agreed to provide all the kits and managed to send them up from their base in Newton Abbot in Devon in time for the shoot.

After that it was the crazy game of organising all the shirts into colours and sizes and getting the right children in the right tops. We laid them all out on tables in the formation we wanted and then the kids filed in and put on the right tops. 

The hardest part? Making sure the kids stayed in the right order as they filed into the gym for the photo. Luckily, they were incredibly well behaved, looked fantastic in their tops and got them all signed by Rooney at the end. A day they will never forget.
