What do you first notice about them? Jackets and ties, hair for the most part well-trimmed and almost all shoes respectfully shone. Were it not for the guitar in the centre it could be any group of young Sixties male office workers and pretty shorthand typists celebrating a collective Pools win.

But look a little closer. Isn’t that Mick Jagger next to Keith Richards, letting the side down with their longish hair and louche jumpers in the bottom left-hand corner; over on the right there’s fellow Rolling Stones Bill Wyman and dandy Brian Jones. Where’s drummer Charlie Watts? Oh, yes, up there in the back row, as glum as ever.

And the girl in the leather coat who looks like the boss’s secretary? Surprise, surprise, it’s Cilla Black — not long out of the typing pool and a star for less than six months.

Then there’s the young lady with the fringe on the other side of the guitar who seems to be cowering from the attentions of the three youths around her? It’s Cathy McGowan, 50 years ago the dizziest, most envied, best-connected girl in Britain as the co-presenter of TV’s Ready Steady Go.

‘The weekend starts here,’ the show boasted, but for millions it was the Sixties that started there on ITV, every Friday night with its organised chaos of live music, ordinary kids dancing and the sheer essence of being young.

It was April 1964, and this photo captured rehearsals for the Ready Steady Go Rave Mad Mod Ball at the Empire Pool Wembley.

And, with the exception of The Beatles, who four days earlier had overwhelmed America by having the top five records there, nearly all of the beat boom stars are here, a first crop of what would soon be a golden generation of British pop stars. There’s Paul Jones, still with Manfred Mann, Freddie And The Dreamers and Sounds Incorporated.

Most dominant are the Merseybeat acts, like Cilla herself, and all the others from Liverpool’s Cavern Club, the Searchers, the aptly-named Merseybeats and heartthrob Billy J. Kramer with his Dakotas and the Fourmost, both of whom got John Lennon’s cast-off songs that weren’t good enough for The Beatles.

And what a conservative-looking crowd of kids they were, or, should we say, gang of boys, because pop then was an overwhelmingly male profession. With the exception of Cilla and Cathy, the only other non-male is blonde-haired Kathy Kirby, she of the shiny lips and tight dresses, who seems to be in conversation with Keith Fordyce, the show’s other presenter.

Fordyce was ancient in comparison with the others. Thirty-five, if he was a day, even older than Kenny Lynch, the only non-white artist, who was already 26.

The prevailing general image of the Sixties today is a colourful time of flowing hair entwined with flowers, of bells, beads and flares and Regency-styled suits.

Well, perhaps it was by 1967, but not in 1964. The tab collars and tight-across-the-crutch trousers may suggest Carnaby Street, and the Chelsea boots, with built-up heels in Mick Jagger’s case to give him an extra 2in of height, were probably Anello & Davide, who were the cobblers to the groovy back then.

But there isn’t a pair of blue jeans in sight. Showing how rich you were, how anti-Establishment and intelligent by donning denim was yet to arrive. 

And now: Mick Jagger (left) pictured in concert in June this year and Cilla Black (right), who had a TV biopic earlier this year

Still going strong: The seemingly indestructible lead guitarist for the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, pictured performing in May this year

Charlie Watts (left) performing at the O2 and Manfred Mann (right) looking slightly different from his Sixties heydey 

And at least half the performers here haven’t adopted a trailblazing Beatle moptop. Shoulder-length hair on men was years away. As for moustaches and beards, they were for old men (OK, Manfred Mann has a neatly-trimmed beard, but he was a reconstituted jazzer, and therefore cerebral.)

The people in this photo might have been going to a charity mod ball, but there isn’t much that was particularly mod or even modish about them. Casual smart was the style for stepping out in then, whether it was going to work, to the local youth club or to appear on TV.

These guys probably wouldn’t have had many more ‘best’ clothes anyway, because what we see here, with only one or two exceptions (yes you, Bill Wyman), is a generation of grown-up war babies. Thrilled by their good luck, they are young and mainly working class, born in the bomb-threatened early Forties and brought up and educated in Fifties austerity.

When this photo was taken, they were mainly in their early 20s and just about to be part of an explosion of opportunities to which their talents and the times gave them a kind of life their parents’ generation could never have imagined.

No wonder — Charlie Watts aside — they looked so happy. And I bet even he was smiling inside.
