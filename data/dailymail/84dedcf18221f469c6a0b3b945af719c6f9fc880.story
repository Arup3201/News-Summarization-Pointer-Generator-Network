David Cameron will today try to launch talks on a free trade deal between Europe and the US that could be worth £380 a year for every British household.

The Prime Minister wants to use this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland to launch formal negotiations on an agreement that could be worth up to £10billion to the UK and £85billion worldwide.

He will argue that a free trade deal – similar to that which operates inside the EU – would 'turbo-charge the transatlantic economy'.

Prime Minister David Cameron arrives at Belfast International Airport to attend the Enniskillen G8 summit where he wants to launch formal negotiations on an agreement with the U.S.

'These trade deals matter, because they mean more jobs, more choice for consumers and lower prices,' he said.

Trade, tax and transparency were three vital drivers of growth that could produce 'transformative results', he said.

Mr Cameron said he wanted 'a meeting where we can look each other in the eye' to solve the problems.

But the most important issue is how to promote economic recovery, with action needed to boost growth, create jobs and reduce poverty, he added.

'Let's be clear, we still need to deal with fiscal deficits,' he said. 'Each country needs to press on with sorting out its public finances. Each country needs active monetary policy to kickstart the affordable loans and mortgages that businesses and families need.

'And each country needs to deal with the problem of youth unemployment by pursuing the structural reforms and flexible labour markets that are vital for competitiveness and jobs.'

France has urged for any trade agreement to include special protections for its film and TV industries against U.S. imports.

There is also uncertainty over another of the Prime Minister's G8 priorities – an international deal to crack down on tax havens.

Another key aim of the summit is a global deal on the payment of ransoms to terror groups who take hostages. Mr Cameron hopes it will 'choke off' a source of terror funding, given that some countries do still pay ransoms.

'It's an ambitious agenda. It's a very practical agenda,' he said.
