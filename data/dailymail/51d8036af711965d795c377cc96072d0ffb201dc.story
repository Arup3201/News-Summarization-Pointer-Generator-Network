Fed up with rowdy holidaymakers from Britain and other countries, authorities in Magaluf have announced plans to crack down on the kind of antics that have earned it the reputation of ‘Shagaluf’. 

Lawmakers are planning to ban pub crawls and drinking in the street 'because it does not benefit the municipality', and fly in British police officers to patrol the main tourist strip of Punta Ballena in a bid to rid the Mallorcan resort of its unsavoury image and transform it into a ‘mature tourist zone’.

The notorious holiday resort is overrun with booze-fuelled and sexually-charged tourists, especially young Britons, and local residents and officials with the municipality of Calvia have finally had enough.

Lawmakers are planning to ban pub crawls and drinking in the street in the notorious holiday resort

The Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea has long been a popular destination for young Britons looking for sun, sand, cheap booze and sex.

In July, authorities announced restrictions on tourist pub crawls a week after shocking video emerged showing an 18-year-old Northern Irish woman performing oral sex on 24 men in a nightclub in return for a free drink.

After the move was announced hotel occupancy by Britons fell by three per cent, but officials are undeterred even though they risk losing more tourists.

At the time, elected officials said they would do whatever it takes to clean up Magaluf's image.

This week, Jaime Martinez, the minister of tourism for the Balearic government, told local media that Magaluf would become a ‘mature tourist zone’ in time for next year’s tourist season.

That means public spaces will be ‘rehabilitated’ to eliminate public disorder and businesses which cater to holidaymakers, including bars and event organisers, have been given six months to submit plans explaining how they will modernise and conform to the new rules.

Eugenia Frau, deputy minister of tourism for Calvia, said authorities will have ‘complete control’ to ensure that the doors of bars and discos close at midnight.

Teresa Palmer, a local delegate for the Balearic government, said citizens are ‘horrified’ by the debauchery that has attracted worldwide attention.

She said Magaluf is ‘not a lawless city’ and the rowdy behaviour is a result of ‘a problem of incivility and education’, Deia reported.

In addition to public drunkenness, she said other problems reported by locals include drug use, robberies related to street prostitution and violence on party boats.

She is asking Spain’s Civil Guard to deploy teams who specialise in handling large crowds to assist local officers.

Last year, Magaluf brought in police from France and Germany to patrol the main tourist strip, and Ms Palmer said the patrols were effective because tourists showed more respect for officers from their homeland.

Last year, 223 visitors from the UK were expelled from hotels, an increase of nearly 75 per cent from 2012, when 129 were forced out. As of July, 92 Britons have been kicked out of Magaluf hotels in 2014, according to the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Association.

It is estimated that one million Britons a year visit the area, spending approximately £628m (€800m).

Given all of the troubles with rowdy holidaymakers resorts are now starting to go out of their way to attract mature tourists, and Palma de Mallorca, just east of Magaluf, has implemented fines of up to £470 (€600) for bad behaviour.

It is part of a trend that is sweeping across Spain as residents urge local governments to bring an end to drunken and sexually-charged tourists’ free-for-all.

Earlier this year, the seafront town of Tossa de Mar, on Catalonia’s Costa Brava, banned stag and hen parties during the month of August and placed them under strict regulations throughout the rest of the year.

The rules are aimed at party planners – not individual groups of visitors – who organise booze cruises, treasure hunts and other events. The town is taking action after locals complained about drunken and scantily-clad partygoers urinating in the street and singing loudly in the town’s squares in the early morning hours.

On the outskirts of Barcelona, the picturesque fishing village of Barceloneta has become a popular stop for young tourists thanks to its all-night raves.

Last August, furious locals held protests at blocks of flats rented to holidaymakers, with chants of ‘out, out, out drunken tourists’. The protests were organised after a photo posted online showed three naked Italian tourists running out of a supermarket.
