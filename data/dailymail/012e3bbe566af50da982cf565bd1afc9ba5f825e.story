This is a 'once in a lifetime chance' to own a large piece of British maritime history - after an historic 120-year-old pier was put up for sale for £195,000.

Shotley Pier was built in 1894 as a landing stage for a ferry from the tiny Suffolk village across the River Stour to Felixstowe, and Harwich in Essex.

The Victorian seaside landmark is on the market with Colchester-based East Anglian Renovations (EAR), which bought it two years ago.

The promenade, formerly owned by the Marquess of Bristol whose family seat was Ickworth House in Bury St Edmunds, was originally a toll pier.

That enabled people to take the boat trip. The Royal Navy’s famous HMS Ganges training ship and centre was set up at the pier in 1905.

Many thousands of young naval ratings were trained at Shotley through two world wars until the complex was shut in 1976.

EAR director Ian Newman said: ‘This is a once in a lifetime chance to own one of the five remaining piers left in Suffolk and a part of our naval history.

Location: Shotley is nine miles from the nearest major town by land of Ipswich, but a public foot ferry runs in the summer connecting it with Harwich and Felixstowe

‘With the proposed regeneration of Shotley including the HMS Ganges development into 400 homes, the pier is a great investment and provides the opportunity for further development.’

The picturesque pier has planning consent for two food kiosks at its shore end.

Shotley is nine miles from the nearest major town by land of Ipswich, but a public foot ferry runs in the summer connecting it with Harwich and Felixstowe.

There are some 2,300 people living in Shotley and the average house value in the village’s postcode area of IP9 is £285,000.
