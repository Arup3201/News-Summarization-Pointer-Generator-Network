Unique taste: Heston Blumenthal at a party with Pippa Middleton... not drinking his gin

He is one of the most feted chefs in Britain, with an enviable six Michelin stars and a reputation for creating exciting and innovative new tastes.

Now Heston Blumenthal has launched a typically exotic gin, infused with tea and lemon. But despite his track record, and a suitably elevated price tag, the drink has just come bottom of an expert taste test.

Embarrassingly, his Earl Grey & Lemon Gin even scored considerably lower than Aldi’s own brand budget spirit, which costs less than half as much.

Blumenthal said of his drink: ‘The addition of Earl Grey with its aromatic bergamot makes this a spirit with real spirit.’

Expert taster Martin Isark acknowledged that Blumenthal was ‘pushing the boundaries’ with his concoction – but came to the blunt conclusion: ‘It does not work.’

He tested several gins according to four criteria: bottle design, price, the taste neat and with Schweppes tonic water.

Only on design did Blumenthal’s product – part of the Heston From Waitrose range for the upmarket supermarket chain – score top marks. It was equally poor served neat or with tonic.

Isark gave the £23 bottle just 44 points out of 100, saying: ‘When drunk neat the gin is aggressive from midway to swallow and the Earl Grey blend does not complement the tonic at all well.

‘The botanicals make it flavoured but with the bergamont you have the tea taste there. It does not work on any front.’

In contrast, Aldi’s £9.99 own brand – Oliver Cromwell London Dry – managed to secure fourth spot with 85 points. It scored 15 out of 25 for taste neat and full marks for taste with tonic and for price.

Top-ranked was the familiar Beefeater brand, among the cheapest at £14 for a 70cl bottle. The most expensive spirit tested, the £32 City of London Dry, also scored poorly, coming in eighth out of ten.

Isark, who conducted the survey for his consumer website Can I Eat It? added that the mixer was important too, saying: ‘If you are a G&T drinker you are wasting your hard-earned cash buying high priced, super premium, elegantly flavoured gin only to pour pronounced quinine-flavoured tonic water into it.’

A Waitrose spokesman said that Heston’s gin was best drunk with Fentimans tonic water.

She added: ‘If you do not like Earl Grey or bergamont you may not like this gin. It’s really popular with our customers. It’s all quite subjective. It’s a twist on traditional flavour – that’s the point.’
