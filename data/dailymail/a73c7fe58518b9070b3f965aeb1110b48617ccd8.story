In the last few years, Carole Middleton's inner circle has become increasingly A-List, with the 60-year-old counting even the Queen among her friends. 

And now the grandmother of the future king has been spotted with a man who is arguably the Canadian king of Rock n' Roll.

Photos have now emerged of Carole and her husband Michael with the singer Bryan Adams in St Lucia on January 25.

Carole Middleton was pictured walking alongside the Canadian singer Bryan Adams at St Lucia airport on January 25

The couple were snapped walking alongside the Eighties star at the island's international airport as they boarded a plane to Mustique for her 60th birthday celebrations.

Carole can be seen smiling widely and clutching her panama hat to her head as she makes her way towards the plane.

Despite a lengthy journey from the UK to the Caribbean, Carole appeared fresh-faced and fashionably attired in blue skinny jeans, a navy and cream floral top and black pixie boots.

She covered up the effects of the long-haul flight with a pair of enormous black sunglasses.

Michael Middleton was dressed very smartly for the long trip in khaki chinos, a pale blue oxford shirt and a navy blazer. 

Bryan appeared far more casually dressed in comparison, in a tight black T-shirt, black jeans and black trainers.

He is a regular visitor to Mustique since buying a villa on the island several years ago.

The Middletons looked remarkably calm and collected after a long journey to the Caribbean from the UK, as they boarded a plane for the last leg of their journey to Mustique 

Carole and Michael were flying to Mustique ahead of the rest of their holiday companions, which included The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Pippa, 31, and James, 27.

Along with Pippa and James, rumoured guests included Basil Charles, the owner of Mustique's much-loved Basil's Bar, and the island's resident doctor Michael Bunbury and his wife Lotty. 

The family were booked in for two weeks at Villa Rocina, a £14,000-a-week four-bedroom house with a beautiful infinity pool and four staff — a chef, butler, housekeeper and gardener.

They were there for Mrs Middleton's birthday celebrations, which, according to sources, was fun, informal and noisy and included bespoke cocktails created especially for the event. 

Those not invited included Mrs Middleton's brother Gary Goldsmith, whose colourful lifestyle has proved embarrassing on occasion.

Also off the guest list was James' girlfriend Donna Air, 35, and Pippa's boyfriend Nico Jackson, also 35, who were dropped due to limited space at Villa Rocina.

Carole's daughter Kate, who is almost seven months pregnant, and her husband William joined her on the island for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April.

They were pictured last Friday boarding a British Airways plane back to the UK.

Prince William led the way with the family's luggage, which included a floral-print holdall from Cath Kidston,  while Kate followed behind with a sleepy-looking 18-month-old George.  

The couple are heading back to Britain for the start of an intense period of engagements, beginning with the Duchess of Cambridge's visit to Hampshire on Thursday. 

32-year-old William is currently studying for the pilot's licence that will enable him to fly EC145 T2 aircraft when he joins the East Anglia Air Ambulance Service this summer.

Although the prince is already qualified to fly a Sea King helicopter, his new role requires five months of training, which he is currently completing, 14 exams and a flight test.
