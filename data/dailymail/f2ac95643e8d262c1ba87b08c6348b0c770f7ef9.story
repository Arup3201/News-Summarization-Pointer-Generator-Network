A former U.S. prison chief got the shock of his life after visiting a correctional facility in Norway and discovering that even hardened criminals are afforded a lifestyle far removed from that on offer back at home.  

For 38 years, retired superintendent James Conway worked in the Attica Correctional Facility in New York but found little to prepare him for his recent trip to Halden Prison in Norway.

The U.S. famously has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world and Conway told the makers of a made-for-TV documentary called The Norden, that he had never wasted time worrying about his inmates well-being.

Retired superintendent James Conway was shocked when he visited luxurious Halden prison in Norway

He said he could not believe what he saw and had a hard time believing it was a prison after taking a tour

‘It was your actions that put yourself here,’ he said. ‘Who cares how they feel?’

Halden Prison is one of Norway's newest correctional facilities and takes an approach to inmates that had Conway questioning if he was really in a prison, reports Finansakrobat.

‘I'm having a hard time believing that I'm in a prison,’ Conway told Jan Stromnes, deputy head of the prison as he took Conway on a tour.

As he is given a tour of the grounds, Conway is shocked at how green the surroundings are.

Mr Conway was worried by the kitchen at Halden Prison which featured real knives and forks

He was shocked by the luxury items available to prisoners including an Xbox and a recording studio

'Jan, it would appear that you've chosen to construct your prison in a forest and in a mountain area. Can you offer any explanation as to why that would be?' he said.

Stromnes explained that the architect suggested that the prison 'keep as much of the nature as possible' so inmates could serve under normal conditions — a key principle of the Norwegian prison system. 

Next, Conway visits Unit C, a building that houses 84 inmates. 

Ten inmates share a spacious living room complete with a large television and dartboard. 

Conway is most shocked by the kitchen, which actually features real knives and forks. 

'I'm surprised to see metal silverware in a high-security facility,' he said. 'It's a very well-equipped kitchen.'

The inmates even had a workshop with sharp tools and hammers which could be used as weapons

The kitchen has other surprises for Conway, with the cupboards well stocked with glasses and porcelain dishes. 

'Very functional - however very sharp,' said Conway. Elsewhere in the facility inmates even have access to tools. 

After being shown wire hangers in the closets, Conway voices his surprise and warns that inmates could fashion the top into an 'ice-pick-type weapon.'

But 'if there is a steel knife in the drawer around the corner, why would you need metal from a hanger?' he reasons.

Beyond his safety concerns,  Conway was also surprised by the luxury items available to prisoners including an Xbox and a recording studio.

'I know there's a lot of education and vocational programmings to prepare inmates for work on the outside, but I must say I've never seen anything like this,' Conway admits.

He said that if inmates at his old prison could design the prison of their dreams - it would look a lot like Halden

'This may be a little over the top.' 

Stromnes explains that the recording studio is part of a music teaching program, which officials hope will lead to less crime. 

'This is prison utopia,' said Conway. 

He said that if inmates at his old prison could design the prison of their dreams - it would look a lot like Halden.

'I don't think you can go any more liberal - other than giving the inmates the keys.' 

In spite of Conway finding fault with the prison he visited, the numbers show that  Norway has an incarceration rate of 70 per 100,000, totaling 3, 571 inmates for the entire country.

The rate in the U.S. is more than 10 times that with 707 per 100,000, or 2,228,424 people behind bars.
