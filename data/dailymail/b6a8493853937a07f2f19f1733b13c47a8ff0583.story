Some of the very British elements of the Olympics Opening Ceremony may have left some viewers across the world bemused, but at least one character was instantly recognisable - bumbling funnyman Mr Bean.

The London Symphony Orchestra took centre stage playing Chariots of Fire as Mr Bean - British actor Rowan Atkinson - took to a keyboard.

Half-way through the performance he took out his phone and then proceeded to sneeze, while playing one key repetitively.

He look around as though he was bored and stared at his wrist watch as the orchestra played on.

The performance cut to a video of Mr Bean running down the beach made famous in the opening scene of the 1981 film.

He looked as if he was struggling against the other runner, but looked jubilant when he finally crossed the finish line.

Last night Mr Bean was trending on social networking site Twitter as well as the words Rowan Atkinson.

Emma J Thomas tweeted: 'If there ever was a time for the world to get British humour then #mrbean would be it!'

exceeds my expectations.'

But Olympics sponsor Samsung drew 
criticism for their product placement as the phone Rowan Atkinson pulled
 out of his pocket was clearly identifiable as a Samsung model.

Members of the public lambasted the public on Twitter for their ‘shameless’ product placement.

One user, Diarmuid Murphy wrote: ‘Samsung are getting money worth for sponsorship.’

Matthew Copperwaite wrote: ‘New game for the Olympic openingceremony: naming the phones used (all Samsung of course).’

Samsung posted a picture of Atkinson with the phone on Twitter, along with the message: ‘A very special performance of Chariots of Fire featuring Mr Bean and a #Samsung Galaxy Ace!’

Other users commented on the appearance of a modern BMW Mini.
