Old-fashioned girls' names such as Doris, Edna and Hilda are making a comeback, but Harper - the name of the Beckhams' daughter - has climbed the highest on the 2014 list of baby names.

Rising 67 places to number 77, Harper outstripped the likes of Thea, Darcie and Lottie to become the girls' name growing fastest in popularity.

The list also revealed some of the more unconventional names given to babies in 2014, including Royal, King, Thor and Dyson, as in the vacuum cleaners.

Harper, the name of the Beckhams' daughter, has climbed the highest on the list of baby names for girls in 2014

Hilda, Edna, Dilys and Doris, which hark back to the Second World War, are making a slight comeback after years of lying dormant. 

Among the odd names given to boys this year are Muse, as in the rock band, and Memphis, the birthplace of Elvis Presley.

Made in Chelsea also appears to have influenced Britain's parents, with Hugo, as in Taylor, and Ollie, as in Locke, climbing the table.

Amelia, Olivia and Emily remain the top three names for girls, holding the same positions as last year.

Jack still tops the list for boys, holding off stiff competition from Oliver and Charlie, which climbed one place to third.

The trends emerged from Bounty Parenting Club's annual report of names handed out to 370,000 babies who were born in the UK this year.

Bounty spokeswoman Lisa Penney said: 'Only a handful of parents named their girls Edna, Hilda and Doris, but this could well be the start of something.

'The trend for old-fashioned names continues to grow for girls and boys. Even Simon Cowell took the plunge this year naming his baby son Eric after his own father.

'Celebrities like the Beckhams are renowned for choosing unusual names for their offspring and today's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd.

'But baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom.

'Just a couple of years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl's name, yet now they regularly feature in the top ten.

'Likewise for boys, a decade ago the names Jacob and Noah were rarely considered and now they are in the top 10 as parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like Matthew, Luke and Adam.'

The name Doris, made popular shortly after the Second World War by the actress Doris Day, is making a comeback

Old-fashioned girls' Edna and Hilda are also returning, but Amelia, Olivia and Emily are the three most popular names for the second year running

Other big climbers in the girl's list are Thea, up 36 places, Darcie, up 29, and Lottie, up 16. Previously popular names such as Megan, Bethany and Brooke have decreased in popularity. 

Some of the more unusual names to appear on this year's girls' list are Peony, Amaryllis, and Poesy - all flowers.

Cici, Gigi, Tiggy, Ziggy and Dexie were also given to one or two baby girls each, as were Lolo, Echo and Halo.

Huge gains were made in the boys' list by Teddy, Elijah, Louie and Freddie. Sebastian, Ronnie and Seth also made big leaps. Meanwhile Cameron, Aiden, Ryan and Connor saw a slump in popularity.

Ms Penney added: 'Whilst certain baby names can quickly rise to fame they can just as easily fall from favour.

'Take Tilly, Lexi and Lacey for example. Now that they are more common in classrooms across the country they no longer make the grade for new parents who want a name that no other child is likely to have in the playground.

'Like celebrities, parents are getting more and more creative with their name choices.

'Indeed, for some the sky really is the limit when it comes to creating something unique.

'Generally speaking whatever a child is called they usually grow up to make it their own, yet mums and dads should bear in mind that a really individual name can be a lot to live up to if you don't grow up to be rich or famous.'
