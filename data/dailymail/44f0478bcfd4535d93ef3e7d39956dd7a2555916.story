A pensioner was so hooked on fishing that he left his marital home on the day he retired to live in a tent by a carp angling lake - and has stayed there for the last four years with his wife's blessing.

Angler Peter Ralph, 66, cashed-in his pension and moved out of the £250,000 house he shared with wife Paula to start a new life beside the water.

Despite being happily married, the retired roofer spends every day and night at Orchid Lake in Dorchester, Oxfordshire, with only his Staffordshire terrier Sugar for company.

Hooked: Angler Peter Ralph, 66, loved fishing so much that he left his marital home to live permanently in a tent by a fishing lake

Moving out: Retired roofer Mr Ralph cashed-in his pension and moved out of the house he shared with wife Paula to start a new life beside the water

He forks out £6,000- a-year for his regular pitch on the river bank and only leaves for a week's summer holiday and a few days over Christmas.

Mrs Ralph supports her husband's hobby, calls him every day and visits him once a month from their spacious detached home on a leafy street in Luton, Bedfordshire, to deliver his 'allowance', clean clothes, and supplies.

'I went away fishing and never went back,' said the father-of-one. 

Support: Mrs Ralph with food she had prepared to bring her husband, including jam tarts decorated with hearts for Valentine's Day. She says of her husband's choice ;if he's happy, I'm happy'

'I'm hooked.'

Mrs Ralph, 55, added: 'If he's happy, I'm happy.'

Mr Ralph has a small battery-powered television, gas fridge, and a bedchair layered with blankets inside his green bivvy tent.

His
 other possessions also include a barbecue and dual stove cooker, which 
he uses to cook the pheasant and rabbit roadkill he finds for dinner.

Mr
 Ralph has already caught the lake's 30lb 6oz mirror carp known as Big T
 but he is still determined to catch more. He has used 486kg of bait 
since moving to Orchid Lake in 2010.

He even pays workmen to decorate the couple's house and maintain his garden in his absence.

Mr Ralph said: 'I've worked hard all my life, putting food on the table and paying off my mortgage.

'When I retired I wanted to escape from it all and get back to nature, finding pleasure in the simple things in life.

'I don't like living in a house, and prefer life in a tent by the lake. It offers a greater sense of freedom.

'I couldn't bear to sit at home all day.'

He
 added: 'I started fishing with friends when I was seven - we would go 
to a bridge in the town with a rod and reel and be happy to catch 
whatever swam past.

'When I got older I joined an angling club, bought better equipment and took it quite seriously, going on fishing holidays.

'It's now a joy to be able to do it full-time.

'However, it is not all about the fishing. I am quite happy to just sit by the lake enjoying the view and my own company.

Home from home: Mr Ralph has a small battery-powered television, gas fridge, and a bedchair layered with blankets inside his green bivvy tent

Lifestyle: He forks out £6,000-a-year for his regular pitch on the river bank and only leaves for a week's summer holiday and a few days over Christmas

Splashing out: Mr Ralph has used 486kg of bait since moving to Orchid Lake in 2010

'It is very relaxing, and I can go weeks without casting my line.

'On
 the days I do fish, I have to make sure I've reeled the line back in 
before Jeremy Kyle starts because I must watch that on TV.

'If I catch something, that's great - but it no longer bothers me if it weighs 10lbs or 50lbs.'

Mr Ralph started work as a roofer when he left school at 16, and started his own business aged 30.

Special guest: Paula Ralph in a tent set up for her at the lake by her husband. She visits monthly to bring him clean clothes and supplies

Destination: The sign next to Mr Ralph's lakeside home

Relaxing: Mr Ralph says he finds his new life by the lake 'very relaxing', and adds that it is not all about the fishing as he is happy just to enjoy the view

He retired at the age of 62 and 
decided he wanted to live a more leisurely lifestyle that would allow 
him to be at one with nature.

That took him to Orchid Lakes, where he remains to this day.

However,
 he was forced to leave for six months a couple of years ago, when the 
stretch water became overcome with weeds and water levels fell.

During that time he moved to nearby Linear Fisheries before returning to his usual spot when conditions improved.

Swap: Mr Ralph has left behind the couple's spacious home on a leafy street in Bedfordshire for a life by the water

Away from the river: Mr Ralph on holiday in Portugal last year

'Thankfully my wife is really supportive,' he said.

'She said it's my time in life to do what I want.

'I've probably only got ten years left on this earth and I want to spend them fishing.'

Mrs Ralph added: 'I do miss Peter sometimes, but because I work full-time and do other activities I am very busy and I don't have much time to miss him.

'We do speak on the phone every day and I pop down there to see him and he comes to see me.'
