Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he had no confidence in the figures, insisting no one knows how many migrants will flock to Britain

The number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants expected when the UK opens its doors next January was put at just 12,700, according to long-hidden figures.

The total, compiled under the Labour government, was  immediately rejected as ‘ridiculous’ by senior Coalition figures.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the estimates, revealed yesterday after months of cover-up by ministers, were drawn up by Labour after comparing the two countries to Poland, which has sent around one million people to the UK.

The document predicts just 4,613 Bulgarians, out of a population of 7.5million, will come to Britain every year, along with 8,156 Romanians – a tiny fraction of its 21.4million inhabitants.

Addressing Westminster journalists, Mr Pickles said he had ‘no confidence’ in the figures and that was why ministers chose not to publicise them, though he said they were slipped out on a Whitehall website in 2011.

The total of 12,769 is very  similar to the 13,000 Labour ministers claimed would come to the UK in 2004, when immigration restrictions were lifted on Poland and nine other Eastern European countries.

In the event, more than a million people have flocked to Britain from Poland alone over the last nine years.

Mr Pickles revealed that the research existed in a television interview in January, but immigration minister Mark Harper refused to release the study, saying it would not be ‘helpful’.

The Home Office had even sought to claim that no such estimates existed.

Yesterday Mr Pickles said: ‘These are calculations. I don’t have any confidence in them whatsoever.’

He added that he doesn’t know how many immigrants will come to the UK in January but hopes it will be lower than in 2004, when many other EU countries refused to lift restrictions at the same time as Britain.

Ministers are drawing up a package of emergency measures to deter Romanian and Bulgarian migrants from flocking to Britain when limits are lifted next year

He said: ‘Last time, we, Ireland and Sweden opened up our boundaries, when France and Germany and Spain didn’t  open up their boundaries, so a  disproportionately large number of Poles came to the UK.

‘This time everyone is opening up at the same time. If you combine Romania and Bulgaria they don’t even meet the level of the Polish population.’

He added: ‘Bulgarians and Romanians have a link with Spain and with France.’

The campaign group Migration Watch UK has estimated up to 75,000 Romanians and Bulgarians could enter the UK a year.

Commenting on the figures, chairman 
Sir Andrew Green said: ‘We regard the estimate as much too low and agree
 with Mr Pickles that it is not a sufficient basis for policy.

‘For a start it ignores the two 
million Romanians in Spain and Italy, many of whom are now unemployed 
and might move to Northern Europe.’

Mr Pickles added: ‘No matter how many fancy calculations you can make, I don’t know. The truth is nobody really knows.

‘All the government can do is be 
careful about pull factors that might range from the health service to 
housing and benefits to try to ensure there isn’t an extra attraction to
 come here.’

Ministers are making plans to require
 new immigrants to register to use public services or claim benefits. 
The Government is also considering sending home those who fail to find 
work.

Minister for local government Brandon Lewis denied there had been a cover-up.

He said: ‘We have been open and transparent in publishing research . . . 

‘This analysis was produced by the 
last administration, and should be treated with extreme caution given 
how unreliable their statistics have been historically.’
