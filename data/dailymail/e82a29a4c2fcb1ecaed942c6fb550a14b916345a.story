A pregnant survivor of the Sydney siege has revealed her unborn baby was unharmed by the crisis, as she paid tribute to her close friend who died in the incident. 

Barrister Julie Taylor, friend of the late hostage Katrina Dawson, today penned an emotional statement about this week's tragic events.

Despite her grief, Ms Taylor, 35, said she had taken comfort from the huge floral memorial in Martin Place and the fact she and her husband will welcome a baby into their family in the coming months.

Days after the floral tribute began, posies were continuing to pile up at Martin Place on Friday morning. Flowers are now laid at three different locations down the street

'My husband and I have been told that our unborn baby is healthy and unharmed by this crisis,' she said.

'If all goes well, and there is no reason to think it won't, we will give birth to a precious baby in a few months.' 

Ms Taylor was visiting the Lindt cafe with Ms Dawson, her colleague at Eighth Floor Selborne chambers on Phillip Street, when Man Haron Monis took 18 people captive for more than 16 hours. 

Ms Dawson was killed after hostages staged an escape attempt around 2am on Tuesday morning. Police officers took Monis out in a hail of bullets. 

'Katrina Dawson was the most wonderful person I have ever met,' Ms Taylor said. 'She was my closest friend, a role model and confidant.

'Her bravery and strength was, and continues to be, a comfort and inspiration for me.  he invested every moment of her life in her friends and family, and will be greatly missed by everyone who has known her. 

'My thoughts and sympathy are with her family, whom I have come to know and love.' 

She also paid tribute to Tori Johnson, the cafe manager who was the other victim of the siege. 

'Although our acquaintance was forged under the worst imaginable circumstances, I feel privileged to have known you and I will always remember you as a kind, considerate, level-headed and courageous person'

'It was clear to me how much you loved your family and how much compassion you had for everyone you met'. 

Ms Taylor said she had also taken comfort from the huge outpouring of public support - particularly from the huge flower memorial that has been established in Martin Place.

Tens of thousands of posies and handwritten messages have been placed at three sites across the plaza, in what has been dubbed 'Sydney's floral heart'. 

Among the messages was a note written by Ms Dawson's youngest daughter, Sasha, which said simply: 'I love you mum. Love Sasha'.

Although words cannot describe the events of the last few days and the feelings that I have towards the survivors and victims of the Martin Place siege, there are a few things I would like to say.

Katrina Dawson was the most wonderful person I have ever met. She was my closest friend, a role model and confidant. Her bravery and strength was, and continues to be, a comfort and inspiration for me. She invested every moment of her life in her friends and family, and will be greatly missed by everyone who has known her. My thoughts and sympathy are with her family, whom I have come to know and love.

I would like to pay tribute to Tori Johnson. Although our acquaintance was forged under the worst imaginable circumstnaces, I feel privileged to have known you and I will always remember you as a kind, considerate, level-headed and courageous person. It was clear to me how much you loved your family, and how much compassion you had for everyone you met. I am grateful that you were with my throughout our ordeal.

To the other hostages, thank you for the support and consideration that you gave me throughout our time together. I will always be grateful to you.

Thank you to the police, ambulance staff and health professionals at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, who helped us throughout 15 and 16 December and afterwards.

It is difficult to be positive at a time like this, but there are two things which provide comfort to me. The first is the overwhelming display of public support for everyone involved in this crisis, including me. My own visit to the Memorial at Martin Place gave me a strength for the coming weeks which I thought that I might not have, as have the messages and kindnesses that have been sent to me by everyone I know and many I don't. It is good to know that none of us is alone.

Finally, my husband and I have been told that our unborn baby is healthy and unharmed by this crisis. If all goes well, and there is no reason to think that it won't, we will give birth to a precious baby in a few months. Although it is an emotional time, we are trying to keep ourselves healthy so that can occur.

I thank members of the media for their respect of our privacy in this difficult time, and ask that you continue to do so.

New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has confirmed the government will examine establishing a permanent memorial to the victims of the tragedy.

In an interview with the ABC's 7.30 program on Thursday night, Mr Baird said he did not want the floral shrine to end. 

'In many respects, Leigh, I don't want it to end. It's just so beautiful down there,' he said. 'And it's the people, it's the stories, it's the families.

'I mean, people, complete strangers are hugging, in tears, putting down the flowers, reflecting on the loss, the thankfulness, in some respects, for the hostages that are still with us and an overall sense in this city that we will get through this.' 

The coroner released Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson's bodies to their families on Thursday nights, who are beginning the process of planning memorial services for the dead.
