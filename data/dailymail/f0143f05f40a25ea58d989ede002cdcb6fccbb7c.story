Beleaguered: Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative Party Chief Whip, says his anti-police image is unfair

Andrew Mitchell yesterday said his verbal assault on Downing Street police had been ‘blown out of proportion’.

The Tory Chief Whip also claimed he did not use the words ‘pleb’ and ‘moron’ in the clash with protection officers who would not let him cycle through the street’s main gate last week.

In an interview with his local paper, Mr Mitchell also sought to paint himself as a friend of the police who visits their station in his constituency at Christmas to thank them for their efforts.

He blamed a 'long and extremely frustrating day' for his rant, and says he has apologised to all concerned so wants to get on with his job.

But to further undermine Mr Mitchell’s explanation for his rant, however, it later emerged the day in question included lunch at 
London’s poshest curry house, the Cinnamon Club.

'I hope my constituents and friends in 
Sutton Coldfield will not recognise the hideous caricature that has been
portrayed in some of the tabloid press,' he told his local paper the Observer.

'I have an excellent relationship with the police whom I know well and 
whom I always go to see at Christmas time to thank for their services to
the people of Sutton.

'I go round the police station and thank all the police who are on duty 
before Christmas for keeping us safe and sound throughout the year,' adding he has 'a tremendously close and warm 
relationship with them'.

Two-wheeled terror: Mr Mitchell had reportedly been stopped from riding his bike out of a gate when he launched the outburst at police

Altercation: Mr Mitchell got in a row after police asked him to go via the side gate of Downing Street, but he wanted to go through the main larger one

After the incident David Cameron called him in for a face-to-face meeting and told Mr Mitchell his behaviour was unacceptable.

He 'looked him in the eye', insisting he didn't use the word, sources said. Mr Cameron has since read an official police log showing he called officers 'f****** plebs', but is expected to stand by Mr Mitchell.

The police log states: ‘There were several members of public present as is the norm opposite 
the pedestrian gate and as we neared it, Mr Mitchell said: “Best you 
learn your f****** place... you don't run this f****** Government... 
You're ******* plebs.”

Claims: Mr Mitchell has constantly denied using the words attributed to him in a police report

‘The members of public looked visibly shocked and I was somewhat taken 
aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior Government
official. I cannot say if this statement was aimed at me individually, 
or the officers present or the police service as a whole.’

The Chief Whip has again gone through his version of events and denied the police report was accurate.

'On Wednesday night I tried to leave Downing Street by the main gate, something I have done many times before.

'I was told that I was not allowed to leave that way. During the subsequent altercation, although I did not use the specific words that have been suggested, I do accept that I did not treat the police with the respect they deserve.

'I have apologised profusely to the police officer involved and to the supervising sergeant.

'It’s been extremely difficult both for me and my family. I have apologised and said that I am extremely sorry. I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone. I would gently point out that I did not say the words that have been ascribed to me.'

Mr Mitchell confirmed that he will be returning to his constituency 'shortly' and is looking forward to getting back to his two roles as MP and Chief Whip - a position he says is 'evolving'.
