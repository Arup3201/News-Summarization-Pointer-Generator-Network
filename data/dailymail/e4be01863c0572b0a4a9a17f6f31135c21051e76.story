With 64 bedrooms, it has enough room for all your in-laws, fifth cousins and great-aunts.

If you think you'd survive that Christmas do,  Hawkstone Hall can be yours for just £4.25million - excluding the heating bill.

The Georgian stately home near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, which hosted the writer of the first English dictionary Samuel Johnson and Waterloo reunion dinners for the Duke of Wellington, is on the market after 90 years in the hands of Catholic missionaries.

Lavish: Grade I listed Hawkstone Hall near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, hosted writer Samuel Johnson and Waterloo reunion dinners for the Duke of Wellington. It has remained on the market for more than two years and it price has been slashed from £5m to £4.25m

Sprawling: The house and its former service wing have a staggering 64 bedrooms - 50 of them single rooms for Catholic missionaries

It originally went on the market for £5million in June 2012, but has remained unsold for more than two years.

Now the estate agents - who admit there's renovation work to be done to turn it back into a private home - have been forced to slash the price to £4.25million.

The Hall's bedroom count is thanks to the fact the Catholic order, the Redemptorists, replaced the north-east service wing with 50 single rooms for its members in 1962.

But the history of the estate itself dates back as far as 1556, and over the years it has been owned by prominent figures and members of Parliament.

The main home, a Grade I listed Georgian mansion in the style of French King Louis XIV, was built around 1700 and has more than 20,000 square feet of living space including a ballroom, Venetian saloon, numerous reception rooms and 14 bedrooms.

Heritage: The house was visited by writer Dr Samuel Johnson, who wrote of the estate's 'shades, precipices, hollows and lofty rocks'

Enough room for you? The house has enough space to host an entire extended family for Christmas - and take them to church

Its visitors included Dr Johnson, who wrote how he was captivated by the estate in 1774.

'By the extent of its prospects,' he wrote, ' the awfulness of its shades, the horrors of its precipices, the verdure of its hollows, and the loftiness of its rocks, the ideas which it forces upon the mind are the sublime, the dreadful and the vast.' 

The ballroom was built for £2,400 for owner Sir Rowland Hill in 1832 and was the setting of many lavish dinners.

He became the first Viscount Hill after rising to prominence in the Napoleonic wars as a trusted general, eventually serving as the Duke of Wellington's second in command at the Battle of Waterloo.

For many years the family toast was: 'May the Hills of Shropshire last as long as the Shropshire hills'.

But the estate - with expanded hugely with an ornamental lake and Gothic arch - fell into decline in a familiar tale of the over-exuberance of the landed gentry.

Liberal MP George Whiteley bought the house and made several additions, including an indoor swimming pool, before the entire estate as it was then was broken up after the First World War.

The bulk of it was sold to local farmers and turned into a hotel but the grand Hawkstone Hall remained, and was sold to the Redemptorists in 1926.

From there its story was a little more prosaic. Scandal-ridden Tory minister John Profumo enjoyed his liaisons with Christine Keeler in a cottage in the grounds, before the estate was used to film a BBC Chronicles of Narnia series in the 1980s.

In recent years, Hawkstone Hall has been run as a retreat for people in the Catholic ministry, but the trustees decided to sell the estate with the aim of turning it back into a private home for the super-rich. 

In London the £4.25million price buys a far more humble three-bedroom terraced house in Queen's Gate Mews, South Kensington - or a mere two-bedroom flat in Drayton Court, Chelsea.

And it works out at around £97 per square foot - one-eightieth of the price of a property in One Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, one of the most expensive places to live in the world.

As a bonus, the buyer gets 88 acres of land which still remain attached to the hall and another two houses and a church in the grounds.

Grand: The estate agents selling the home, which went on the market in 2012, admit there is probably some work to be done on it

Pilgrimage: The home is visited by members of the Redemptorists Catholic order from all over the world, and they leave their mark

Father Maurice O’Mahony, who is leaving after 12 and a half years in the house, said: 'It is a very private place – we are a mile off the main road – and also very peaceful.

'Men and women of great integrity and goodness have come here from across the world. They have left their footprint on this house - a rare quality in any property.

'We look out over the Welsh hills and every day the view is different because of the changing skies and seasons. You get the most amazing sunsets.'

Mike Artham, managing director of estate agents Barbers and Reeves and Partners, said: 'Hawkstone is simply stunning. It is a wonderful, very stylish building in a beautiful setting.'

'During the ownership of the Hills, it became a private house with a national reputation and is known internationally because of its most recent use.'

'Of course, after more than eight decades of occupation by the congregation, there is conversion work to be done, but what a project.'

'The current owners added an accommodation block in the 1960s and I am sure that any purchaser wishing to remove it would be pushing on an open door with conservationists.'

'It is rare to deal with a property which has had so few owners down the centuries and it does bring us a sense of responsibility.'

'You get a lot for the price, particularly when you compare it to parts of London where the same amount of money may only buy you a small flat.' 

Secluded: Current resident Father Maurice O’Mahony said he would miss being a mile from the main road - and the 'amazing sunsets'
