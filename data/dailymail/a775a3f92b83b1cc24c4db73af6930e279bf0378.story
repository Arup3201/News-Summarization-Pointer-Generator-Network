Over the years Matthew McConaughey has become one of the world's most prolific actors.

But, despite his success, the Interstellar star's performances have also prompted a huge number of impressions by a host of comedians. 

However all past attempts at mimicking his voice may have been topped - by a parrot.

Einstein has been copying the Dallas Buyer's Club actor ever since his acceptance speech for Best Actor at the Golden Globes in January. 

His owner says that the 17-year-old bird has been repeating 'Alright, Alright, Alright' over and over again, and he even has a slight Texas twang to his squawks.
