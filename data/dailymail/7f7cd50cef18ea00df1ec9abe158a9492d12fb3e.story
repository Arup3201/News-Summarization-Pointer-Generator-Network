Andre Russell was the hero as West Indies clinched a thrilling one-wicket victory over South Africa in the fourth one-day international at Port Elizabeth.

After Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy had laid the platform with half-centuries, some brutal hitting down the order from Russell (64no) lifted the Windies to their victory target of 263 with one wicket and nine balls to spare.

David Miller's unbeaten 130 - his first ODI century - helped the Proteas to 262 for eight, but it proved to be in vain as they suffered their first defeat of the series.

Boasting an unassailable 3-0 lead, the hosts opted to leave out star names Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander, and they were put into bat after losing the toss.

Rilee Rossouw recorded his eighth single figure score in 13 matches when he edged Sheldon Cottrell to first slip for four, while Faf du Plessis edged behind off Jason Holder soon after.

Morne van Wyk, playing his first ODI in nearly four years, gave Cottrell his second wicket after edging to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin to leave South Africa on 32 for three.

AB de Villiers' first innings since his incredible record-breaking century last week was rather more low key, the captain making 19 before nicking behind off Russell.

Miller and JP Duminy accumulated steadily as they brought a sense of calm to proceedings, with the former thumping his seventh four to bring up his fifty off 75 balls.

Duminy fell seven runs shy of his own half-century when he chipped a return catch back to Sammy, while Farhaan Behardien was bowled by Holder.

With South Africa facing posting a below-par total, Miller came into his own in the final few overs, bringing up his century with a crushing four through extra cover off Holder, who was launched back over his head straight after by the big-hitting left hander.

But Holder claimed a couple of wickets in the final over to finish with four for 53 to stifle the Proteas.

The total still looked to be too much for the Windies, who slipped to 73 for five in response, as their World Cup preparations once again appeared set for another blow.

But Samuels and Sammy at least gave them some hope, the pair each whacking five fours and two sixes to keep the score ticking over.

Sammy departed for 51 when he looked for another big hit, instead finding De Villiers running back from cover off Parnell although Russell settled into his stride in the same over with a well-placed four.

He then registered back-to-back fours off Morkel but the momentum swung drastically back in South Africa's favour when Samuels was bowled by Behardien for 68.

Holder contributed 13 before hitting Duminy to midwicket but Russell continued to find the boundary rope with regularity.

It appeared they would still fall short when Carlos Brathwaite was run out but Russell belted successive sixes off Aaron Phangiso in the 48th over to go bring up his half-century.

That left the Windies needing seven off the final 12 balls and Russell fittingly scored the winning runs with his fifth six, crunching Kyle Abbott over long-on to finish on 64 off 40 balls and ensure a memorable win.
