An obese mother shed three stone and transformed her shape after her four-year-old daughter gave her blunt opinion about her size.

Laura Middleton, 25, was just shy of 15st and dreaded going to the park with her little girl Amy. She suffered from asthma and would be left exhausted by the mildest activity.

But she was shocked when her daughter bluntly told one day last spring: 'You're too wobbly, mummy - you eat far too much.'

It was the stark wake-up call she needed.

She decided to spend her savings and a recent inheritance on an eight-week stay at a weight-loss boot camp.

After dropping her daughter off with relatives, she headed to the No1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, where a gruelling diet and fitness regime meant she was losing 1lb a day.

A typical day consisted of circuit training, spinning, boxing and a hikes of up to six miles. The camp specialises in military physical training with former Royal Marines as fitness instructors.

She tucked into a diet that added up to 1,000-1,200 calories a day, with meals such as caluflower soup and salmon with Chinese vegetables.

In less than two months, Ms Middleton had lost almost three stone –  going down from 14st 9lb to her current weight of 11st 11lb. Her dress size went from a bulky 16 to a far more shapely 12.

She had shaved inches all her problem areas, with her waist measurement dropping from 37" to 34" and her hips slimming down from 41.5" to 37".

After leaving the camp, which cost £3,500, she found she could play in the park with her daughter without getting tired.

'I was like a completely new woman,' she said.

'But the most satisfying thing for me was seeing Amy’s reaction. She told me: "Mummy, you are beautiful – your fat tummy has gone."

The single mother, who is studying for a degree in public sector management in York, piled on the pounds over many years.

She said: 'I didn’t particularly eat unhealthily, I just ate too much. I was eating for four people. And my weight just kept on going up and up.

'I hated what I was doing to myself, but whatever I tried I couldn’t seem to shift it.'

She tried various popular diets and slimming clubs but found none of them worked for her.

She
said: 'I was suffering quite badly from depression and my obesity was 
so bad that they were talking about my having a gastric band operation.

'I
wanted to have one last chance at losing the weight naturally and that 
is why I checked in to No 1 Boot Camp. I wanted to see if you could 
change your life through hard work, dedication and eating the right 
things.'

Laura spent most of last summer at the exclusive weight loss camp in Norfolk

She said: 'It really suited me. I had booked in initially for six weeks but enjoyed it so much I booked for an extra two weeks.

'It didn’t just help me to lose the weight – I was able to change my whole lifestyle.

Overweight: Laura said she didn't eat unhealthy food but she simply ate too much

'It introduced me to a whole new way 
of eating which meant that I didn’t return to the bad habits of old. My 
asthma is cured and I no longer suffer from depression.

'And I was finally able to achieve a 
level of fitness which meant that not only could play for as long as I 
liked in the park with Amy but I wanted to carry on exercising after I 
had left the camp.'

Her weight has remained stable since checking out of the boot camp last September.

'That is the ultimate tribute,' she said.

'With other diets, I would quickly go back to the bad old habits but this has brought about a permanent change.

'Amy loves the new me. She says that her mummy isn’t wobbly any more.'
