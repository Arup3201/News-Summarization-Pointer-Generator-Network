Ever wandered past one of London's beautiful and bizarre properties and wished you could take a sneak peek inside?

As the annual Open House event hits the city again this weekend, curious members of the public have the rare opportunity to explore some of the capital's most outlandish properties.

Open House was started in 1992 to promote public awareness and appreciation of the capital's building design and architecture.

The intention was to open up London's splendid buildings to the general public who would not otherwise have access.

Victoria Thornton, Founding Director of Open-City, said: ‘Open House is a unique and vibrant annual event, offering people across London the chance to explore and learn about the capital’s architecture.

‘In 2013 87% of participants said the Open House annual event was the best way see, explore and learn about the capital’s architecture and new public spaces.

‘This year we’re putting together a great programme of open buildings, walks, tours and talks taking in everything from award-winning contemporary homes to major regeneration areas.’ 

On Open House's website, it says: 'Buildings surround us in a city but but the one thing we do not learn about in schools is the fabric of a place, such as the structure, framework or composition. 

'The urban fabric of our community has such a strong impact on us on an everyday basis, but we never learn about it in schools.'
