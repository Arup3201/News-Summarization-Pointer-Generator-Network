Authorities are investigating a report that gunshots were fired outside the memorial for a 17-year-old student who was stabbed to death during a fight at a Texas high school last week.

The shots apparently broke out on Sunday night outside the Spring Baptist Church near Houston, where friends were paying tribute to student Joshua Broussard.

It has been reported that Broussard was allegedly stabbed by Luis Alonzo Alfaro as tensions between African American students and Latino students reached a deadly boiling point.

The church was filled with students - some of whom ducked for cover in a storage closet or scrambled beneath pews after the fight broke out when a member of a rival gang was seen inside.

Panic: Relatives of 17-year-old Joshua Broussard, who was stabbed to death at school last week, leave his memorial service on Sunday night after gun shots were reportedly heard outside the church

Anger: Friends of the victim said the fight broke out after a member of the gang who allegedly shot Broussard was seen in the church. Police are now investigating the claims there were gunshots

Dramatic: Gang members were reportedly escorted from the church but no arrests were made

Teenagers who were allegedly part of the Brown Pride Gang - of which Alfaro is allegedly also a member - were escorted from the church as the melee broke out in the parking lot.

'They had nothing to do up in here,' Broussard's friend Brandon Odom told KHOU. 'None
 of their people was in here. They're the ones that took Joshua’s life. They don't belong up in here.'

Witnesses reported hearing as many as eight shots break out but the church denied a gun was fired and no shells have yet been found in the area. No injuries were reported.

'Everyone just got into a panic attack and started running,' Broussard's friend Taylor Harris told KHOU. 'Everybody was falling trying to duck because somebody says they saw a gun.'

The 17-year-old lost his life after bumping shoulders with his alleged killer in the school cafeteria last Wednesday. Alfaro has now been charged with murder.

Following his arrest, he allegedly confessed to the killing, telling detectives he and the victim had a run-in inside the cafeteria at around 7am, which quickly escalated to a bloody fight.

The 17-year-old allegedly told police that he bumped shoulders with Broussard, and the two exchanged some words. Alfaro then shoved the teen, and then another student punched him.

Alfaro then pulled a pocket knife out of his shorts and swung it at his adversary while covering his own face with his other arm, according to his statement to police cited by MyFox Houston.

Parents have expressed frustration 
with the school district, claiming that officials have not been 
forthcoming with information, and it took the school too long to send 
out notification about the emergency.

Spring High School serves about 3,000 students. The campus is not equipped with metal detectors.

Police
 officers said that parents of students directly involved in the fight 
already had been notified, and others need not worry for their 
children's safety.

Grief counselors were sent to the school to speak to students who witnessed the bloody altercation.
