An Alabama man who was blinded in one eye when his pet deer savaged him has been charged with illegally keeping wild animals.

Julius Dunsmore has been left partially blind after a buck he had raised turned on him when he went in its pen on October 30.

The deer lifted him on its antlers, severing the optic nerve in one eye and puncturing his rib cage, hips and legs.

Savage: This buck had to be put down by wildlife officials after it mauled the man looking after it

'People need to know that these things are dangerous. You never know when they are going to turn,' Mr Dunsmore said, as he vowed to never keep them as pets again.

The 69-year-old had rescued the buck that mauled him after its mother was killed by a car. He kept it in a pen with six others deer.

Bucks can become combative during 
breeding season, normally fighting with each other or even people when 
the deer are kept in captivity, Kevin Dodd, of Alabama's Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division, said.

He added that does were also dangerous because they could deliver a powerful kick.

Mr Dodd said that people may have good intentions when they try to rescue deer but 'it always ends badly'.

'Illegally held captive deer in 
Alabama have caused numerous serious injuries and one fatality in recent
years,' he told Al.com.

The wildlife department charged Mr Dunsmore was illegally keeping seven deer as pets, which had to be destroyed because they could not have survived outside captivity.

Wildlife officials are now waiting for the results of lab tests to see if any of the animals were carrying diseases.
