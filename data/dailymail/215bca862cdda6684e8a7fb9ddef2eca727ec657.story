Rose tinted glasses: Leonid Brezhnev was ridiculed during his leadership as the butt of a thousand jokes, but has enjoyed posthumous popularity

Russians have voted for their most popular ever leader - and the former Soviet ruler Leonid Brezhnev topped the poll.

He beat tyrant Joseph Stalin and the country’s last tsar, Nicholas II, to claim top prize.

The poll which was published in the Kommersant daily shows that Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964 until his death in 1982, topped the list with 56 percent saying they had a positive view of him.

Famed in the West for his bushy eyebrows, Brezhnev was responsible for a tightening of political repressions after his predecessor, Nikita Khrushchev relaxed some of the Soviet regimes more oppressive policies.

His reign included the Era of Stagnation - a period during the mid 1970s that saw Russia's economic problems ignored as military spending soared.

He also oversaw a period of growing global influence for the Soviets towards the latter stages of the Cold War.

He loved military medals and ensured he was awarded more than 100, including the Order of Victory, which he was was the only person to receive outside of World War Two.

It was posthumously revoked in 1989 as he did not meet the criteria for citation.

He ruled for 18 years until his death at the age of 79.

Stalin, who was responsible for the murder, torture and repression of millions came second with 50 percent.

'Although no one would want to live in the Stalin era, he stands for what’s lacking today – justice and equality in fear,' Kommersant quoted Valery Solovei, a professor of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, as saying.

Third up is Russia’s last tsar, Nicholas II, with 48 percent of respondents liking him.

The poll also demonstrated that Russians prefer strong leader to ones seen as weaker.

Two thirds (66 per cent) had a low opinion of Mikhail Gorbachev who 
oversaw the collapse of communism and Boris Yeltsin reached 64 percent.

An expert said: 'There is a definite trend towards favouring harsh, 
authoritarian leaders over those who gave the people more freedom.'
