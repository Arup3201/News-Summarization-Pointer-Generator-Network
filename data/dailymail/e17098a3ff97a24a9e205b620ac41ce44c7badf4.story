Alison Steadman is tapping her fingers on the table and pursing her lips as she thinks about how different her life is now she’s well into her 60s. It takes her a while, but finally she comes up with an answer. ‘Obviously one has to slow down a little bit,’ she says with a grin. ‘I don’t go clubbing until 3am any more.’

It used to be that 40 was old for an actress, and anything over 60 was practically unheard of. But try telling that to 67-year-old Alison, who must be one of the hardest working people in television; fresh from her documentary about the wildlife of the Shetland Islands she’s down here on the Kent coast on the set of her new sitcom Boomers.

The show follows the lives and loves of a group of 60-something baby boomers in a seaside town and is being talked about as the next Last Tango In Halifax. It begins with Alison’s character Joyce being forced to retire from her job as a receptionist. Joyce knows she’s going to miss being busy, and Alison can empathise.

Retirement’s a dirty word to her. ‘I try not to think about it,’ she says. ‘Actors are lucky because we don’t have to retire. We can if we want to, of course, and sometimes the business retires us, which is a bit sad. I do get tired occasionally, though, and think, “Why am I doing this?” After Boomers I’ve got another job coming up, and a play after that. There have been times I’ve turned things down and then wished I’d done them, but it’s nice to have a choice.’

She’s part of a terrific cast in Boomers, including Stephanie Beacham, Paula Wilcox and Russ Abbot, who play some of Joyce’s friends, while old stalwart Philip Jackson is her much put-upon husband Alan. Comedy legend June Whitfield, now 88, also appears, as the drink-guzzling Joan, the mother of Stephanie Beacham’s character Maureen. ‘June’s amazing, as sharp as anything,’ says Alison. ‘She’s a real example of what you can do if you’ve still got your health and your mind.’

The characters in Boomers seem very real – they are, after all, based on the family of writer Richard Pinto, whose previous credits include Fresh Meat and Citizen Khan. ‘One minute they’re getting on great, the next they’re having a little snipe,’ says Alison, laughing.

‘My character’s a bit of an organiser. She henpecks her husband. Poor guy, he can’t do anything right, so that made it fun to play. I hope I’m not the bully she is, but we all know couples like that.’ Each episode will follow one of the characters as they negotiate relationships, retirement and problems with their children or parents. ‘People will look at it and think, “I do that!” It’s very real,’ adds Alison.

Above all, she’s pleased TV executives are finally realising there’s an older audience out there and making programmes to appeal to them. ‘I think they’ve probably done a few surveys and realised the majority of viewers are over 50. People in their 20s are often out and tend to watch TV through catch-up services.

But the people who regularly sit in during the week are around my age. And that age group wants something it can relate to; we all like to be able to recognise ourselves on TV, don’t we? Life doesn’t stop once you reach a certain age and television bosses are seeing that. Your hopes and desires continue as they always have.’

It’s not just in the acting world that Alison is working hard; she’s also trying to launch a new career as a wildlife reporter. A lifelong birdwatcher who’s been known to get up at the crack of dawn to enjoy her hobby even when she’s filming a show, she’s only now getting the chance to show off this other side to her.

Two recent TV projects – her Shetlands documentary on ITV and a series about how to find your way in the countryside without maps for the BBC a few years ago – represent just the thin end of the wedge of her ambitions. ‘I’d really like to do more wildlife things, particularly in conservation,’ she says. ‘I’ve been trying to do a show about the overuse of plastics for years but no one wants to make it. Creatures are choking on it.’

The Daily Mail has campaigned against supermarket plastic bags, and Alison says she’s passionate about getting the message across. ‘A lot of people are unaware of the nightmare that goes on in our seas,’ she says.

‘If we could make everyone aware it might be our chance to change things. I read about this turtle that washed up on a beach in Mexico with around 280 carrier bags in its stomach.

‘Of course these bags look like jellyfish to a turtle. Apart from choking, they can starve to death because carrier bags aren’t biodegradable. They build up and the animals can’t get any nourishment so they get weaker and weaker – can you imagine what it’s like to die like that?

This is happening to thousands of creatures, and most people aren’t aware of it. I see intelligent, educated people using 12 or 15 carrier bags every time they go to M&S or Waitrose. If you charge 10p a bag it doesn’t matter. Unless you charge £20 a bag people won’t stop.’

She’s a surprise, is Alison Steadman. The Liverpool-born actress is softly spoken, but she’s clearly passionate about the world. The youngest of three girls, whose father was an electrical supervisor, she showed a talent for mimicry at a young age. She trained as a secretary and started work in a probation office, but hated it and applied for the East 15 drama school in Essex. Her audition report said, ‘worth training, will blossom’. Another pupil at the drama school was Mike Leigh who she met in her second year in 1966; he became her husband and father of her sons, director Toby, now 36, and cinematographer Leo, now 32.

He was also to be her greatest collaborator. Their most famous joint enterprise was when Alison played the monstrous Beverly in Leigh’s Abigail’s Party on stage and TV. She’s since played a succession of opinionated ladies, including Pam in Gavin & Stacey, Mrs Bennet in Pride And Prejudice and now Joyce in Boomers. ‘Why do I get cast in these roles?’ she says with a laugh. ‘I’m a shrinking violet!’

Her marriage to Leigh lasted 22 years but the two were reportedly having problems when she met and fell in love with actor Michael Elwyn when he played her husband in the TV series No Bananas 18 years ago. They live in Highgate, north London, but she remains good friends with Leigh. 

She says she still feels young – in her downtime she wears jeans and trendy boots rather than ‘grannified’ dresses. She looks fantastic – although her good skin is entirely natural. She stopped using expensive face creams when she realised they didn’t make a jot of difference; she uses £3.99-a-pot Nivea. She’s always said she’d never have Botox or have a face-lift. Instead she credits her youthfulness with walking a lot and eating healthily.

She seems to keep up with everything, including texting and emailing. ‘I like to keep in touch with the world,’ she says. ‘I love going to the theatre and the cinema and I don’t think I’d ever want to be in a situation where I was cut off from younger people. I like London life; I like to keep up with it. Sometimes the pace of change amazes me. In 20 years things have moved so quickly. I suppose in another 20 years we’ll all be laughing at CDs and DVDs.’

She’s close to her sons, who to her dismay are yet to make her a grandmother, and says they help keep her up to date with things; ‘with all their chat and their banter; what they’re doing and where they’re going.’ She adds, with a knowing smile, ‘And of course one hopes now and again that you can offer a bit of advice about what you’ve been through, even though probably nobody takes it.’

The shoot for Boomers in Herne Bay is an intense one – up at 5am and filming by 7am – but for this workaholic near-septuagenerian that’s all part of the fun. ‘It’s been so busy I haven’t even had time to read the newspapers, which is a big deal for me,’ she says. ‘But I’ve been doing a lot of singing. I have a karaoke machine and if I’m feeling stressed I sing – Adele, Susan Boyle, Nina Simone, anything my voice can cope with. B****r the neighbours!’ laughs this ever-surprising actress.
