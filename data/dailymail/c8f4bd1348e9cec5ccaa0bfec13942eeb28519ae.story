A former university lecturer who refused to pay his council tax in protest against budget cuts has been jailed for 28 days.

Ross Longhurst, 72, was prosecuted over an outstanding £1,028 debt which he owed to Labour-run Nottingham City Council.

He arrived at the city’s magistrates’ court holding a placard declaring: ‘Don’t Pay Council Tax’.

Strident: Ross Longhurst wielded a loudhailer outside court before he was jailed for 28 days for not paying up

Before the case he said he was prepared to go to prison for his cause to show 'solidarity' with the victims of austerity measures.

And once in the dock, he even urged the magistrates to stop paying their council tax and added: 'I encourage everyone in court...don't pay up.'

In court Longhurst, from New Basford, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘These (cuts) particularly impact on poor people. We live in a country where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.’

Magistrates heard Longhurst had refused to pay a penny of council tax since for a year in protest against cuts at the local authority.

Nottingham was forced to save £25.5million in 2013 and raised council tax by 1.95 per cent.

Anger: Longhurst urged the magistrates jailing him not to pay the tax, which has risen 1.95 per cent

National cuts spanning several years are forcing the council to save £125million a year from its budget in total.

The former Loughborough University 
social and media studies lecturer admitted a charge of non-payment of 
council tax between April 1, 2013 and March 31 this year. 

As he was led down to the cells by 
prison guards he was applauded by his supporters and one could be heard 
shouting: 'It's absolutely disgraceful.'

Angry: The retired lecturer arrives at court

Longhurst - who had three pensions, 
including a teacher's pension and his state pension - was left with a 
total bill of £1,028.86.

The court heard Longhurst had not 
communicated with the council about his financial position, had not 
given a statement of means and turned down legal advice from a duty 
solicitor.

The hearing was 
brought following failed efforts to recover the money he owed after the 
court made a previous liability order which demanded he pay the full 
amount, plus costs of £70.

Before the case Longhurst conceded: 'I will have to do the time.

'I'm prepared to do it, because I have made a stand on the matter and I will have to see it through.'

He
 also accused the Labour-run council of showing 'callous disregard' for 
local people and said the Coalition Government was waging a 'war on the 
poor'.

Nottingham City Council's deputy leader, Councillor Graham Chapman, said after the case: 'By continuing to refuse to pay his council tax, Mr Longhurst unfortunately left the magistrates with no option but to imprison him.

'We have a legal duty to collect it and so had no option but to bring this case to court.

'We have been doing all we can to minimise the impact of the cuts on key services, especially those which are relied on by vulnerable people, and take no pleasure in carrying out the cuts or bringing case like this to court.

'Councillors' allowances have been 
frozen for over four years, during which time we have had to save £125 
million from our budget.'

Cuts: Nottingham City Council is having to shave a total of £125million a year from its budget

One of his supporters, who did not want to be named, said afterwards: 'It is a travesty that he has been jailed.

'It is disgusting, he is an elderly man who was trying to make a stand, he was trying to make the area a better place and this is why he is now behind bars.

'He has worked and paid council tax, but as all of us do, he got sick of it, he was braver than everyone because he stood up for what he thought was right.'
