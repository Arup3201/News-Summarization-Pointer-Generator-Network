Tyson Fury is back on form on Twitter. He loves a good Twitter rant, this time calling out Anthony Joshua for a fight.

It's great news for us that the leading domestic heavyweights are realising that AJ is the 'money' in the division and even though that fight won't be next, I can certainly see it happening in 2015. You know how I feel about that fight - Anthony would destroy him. But I give Tyson plenty of credit - he is a talented young fighter with a wicked sense of humour!

About 90 per cent of people who replied to his rant on Twitter share that view. No one can see Fury taking a clean shot off Joshua, who I can reveal here will likely have a fight on January 31 at the O2 Arena in London.

Even though Fury has only fought twice in 18 months and has gone off the radar, we’d love to make the fight for AJ. The interest will be immense, but I think that is the case for all his fights at the moment. The public realise he is a special talent and I, as his promoter, know that very well. That is why we are doing everything right. We are picking the right opponents at the right times to enable him to grow as a fighter.

David Price, another talented British heavyweight, is also keen and even though the British public see that as an easy night's work for AJ I believe it's a stern test, particularly at this stage of his career, but for all these guys there can only be one outcome - AJ by the big KO.

As it happens, Joshua is destroying everything in sight. He is out next against Michael Sprott on November 22, which should hopefully provide him with his biggest challenge. Sprott is durable, as is Denis Bakhtov, but we saw what Joshua did to him last time out.

We called Sprott after AJ beat Bakhtov to check he still wanted it. I think he was offended. He is training hard and has already told me to make sure I pay him well for the rematch! We are confident for another impressive win but anything can happen in heavyweight boxing.

Then I hope to put him on a show at the O2 on January 31. Kevin Johnson is a name that's been touted. Surely he can give AJ the rounds?

After that, bring on the Brits. In Fury, Price, Chisora and David Haye there is a pathway of excellent fights and I want, as a fan, to see them all.

I am still working on making a fight between Carl Froch and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. I think it’s the only fight at the moment that would motivate him to go back into a training camp.

To make it, Chavez has a few issues he needs to resolve with his promoters, Top Rank. If they can do that then it is my job to deliver this fight for Carl.

Obviously James DeGale was hoping to fight Carl, but he must now focus on his November 22 fight against Marco Antonio Periban. That’s a tough fight and I give James massive credit for taking such a big test when he is already mandatory.

Assuming Carl vacates his IBF super-middleweight world title, DeGale as the mandatory challenger will then fight for the belt in early 2015. DeGale as a world champion – I can see that appealing to Carl. Summer 2015 at Wembley for a unification fight? Let’s wait and see.

The November 22 show now features George Groves fighting against Denis Douglin. I see this as a massive banana skin for Groves.

On paper he should be comfortable. But I rate Douglin close to Christopher Rebrasse, who took George the distance in his last fight. For Douglin, this is his big chance to make a name for himself. For Groves, you have to wonder how driven he is after what happened against Carl at Wembley.

Douglin is certainly confident, judging by his comments. He’ll be looking to take Groves into the second half of the fight so he can see how much Groves wants it. Groves needs to be careful.

I love a top-level domestic fight, I think they are special. When the two guys are from the same city then you have something unique. I think that is what we have in Tommy Coyle and Luke Campbell in Hull.

It is a great fight city. I have taken four shows there following the one at the weekend and they are getting better and better. The people there realise they are fortunate to have two world-class lightweights on their doorstep and those same fighters are on a collision course for a huge fight in the summer.

The way they both handled themselves on my Hull show at the weekend was perfect. Coyle pulled off a stunning knockout against the brilliant and well-prepared Michael Katsidis. Katsidis spent seven weeks over here preparing but had no answer to Coyle.

Coyle has made a name for himself in his own right. People thought he would fade away a bit after losing to Derry Mathews last year, but he has been superb since coming back.

Campbell, meanwhile, is an Olympic champion-turned-world champion in the making. I am certain of it. He has done so much in so few fights. I think he will be a star at this weight and win another title in the next division as well.

Campbell versus Coyle is a fight I have already started working on. Craven Park and the KC Stadium are both interested in a summer fight. The date of May 30 at the KC Stadium has been discussed but it might clash with rugby, so we are considering alternatives.

I want them both to fight again in February or March and then it’s the big one.

All the indications are that we might finally see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao get in the ring together. About time.

Like all fans I’ve found it infuriating that the two best fighters never went in the ring. Now it looks like it will happen. It’s a couple of years too late for my taste but it’s a fight we all want to see anyway.

I think Floyd realises that this is the only major box office draw left. I don’ t see him fighting Amir Khan and none of the other names are particularly interesting. A fight with Pacquiao is worth mega money and it’s a fight I think he wins.

If they had fought four or five years ago I think it would have been close with Floyd edging it. I think he will win more comfortably if they fight next year. For now, I just want to see it happen.

We are deep in talks for two of our top fighters to challenge for the world title, one here and one in Europe. Expect these in January and February and also expect more world champs for Britain. Details soon.
