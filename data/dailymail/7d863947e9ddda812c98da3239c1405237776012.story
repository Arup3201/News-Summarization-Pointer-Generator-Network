Artful Dodger: Levers Zinca was banned from an area of Longsight, Manchester

Posing as a starving beggar, he targets innocent cashpoint users with all the skill of a modern day Artful Dodger.

As they punch their pin numbers into the machine to withdraw their money, the teenage thief swoops.

Distracting them by holding a placard or newspaper in front of their faces he pleads for money for food.

But as their view is blocked he presses the £200 button and pockets the cash, leaving his anxious victims to hurry away without realising they have been robbed.

Now one of the scores of Romanian children who operate in Fagin-style gangs has been named and shamed.

Levers Zinca, 15, has been handed an Asbo after being repeatedly hauled before the courts.

Starting when he was just 11 years old police say the teenage thief has made a career of his distraction thefts and has made off with many thousands of pounds.

He is just one of dozens of similar youngsters targeting cashpoint users across the UK. Just 18 months ago police smashed a child trafficking ring after a series of dawn raids in Manchester.

Operation Epee aimed to smash the Roma organised crime groups which illegally brought children to Manchester so they could take to the streets and rob the public.

Fifteen children from the Roma community were taken into temporary care to protect them.

Police fear many children are being taken from their families and used by gangmasters to commit theft and robbery.

Working with another teenager called Spartacus Mihai, Levers Zinca would swoop on cashpoint users in Longsight, Manchester.

He had a massive criminal record with a string of convictions for identical thefts and robbery dating back to 2007, when he was just 11 years old.

Zinca has been banned from an area along Stockport Road between Kirmanshulme Lane and Delamere Road

Despite being handed detention and training orders totalling 44 months, the teenager simply returned to his life of crime.

When he was hauled before magistrates he admitted a further six counts of theft and two of attempted theft.

Now he has been told he could face a jail sentence of up to five years if he fails to abide by the terms of a three-year Asbo.

An interpreter was in court to translate the proceedings for Zinca and his father, who has eight children and receives around £460-a-week in state benefits.

One victim told police that he was targeted by the boy just before Christmas when he was getting cash out to buy presents for his children.

Another told them: ‘I feel so angry this has happened. I blame myself and feel responsible as the money was for my family. I didn't sleep last night. I can't believe somebody would do this.’

Nick Vitti, prosecuting, told Manchester magistrates court the ASBO was 'a proportionate response to what has happened in order to protect the public'.

He added: ‘The modus operandi of these offences are that this defendant approached people at cash points in concert with other people. Those victims were distracted and money was taken from them. They were robbed, basically.’

After the hearing, Constable Dale Chadwick of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘These were cowardly and callous crimes targeting vulnerable people at cashpoints.

‘This will hopefully bring closure for his many victims who have been left extremely distressed by what he has put them through. The police and the council will work tirelessly to make the streets safer and hopefully this will make the community safer.’

Cllr Jim Battle, deputy leader of Manchester Council, said: ‘This was completely unacceptable criminal behaviour and Manchester residents should be free to use cash machines in the city without fear of having their money stolen.

‘Residents should be reassured that we have taken this order out, and I'd urge anyone who sees him breaking any of the conditions to contact the police immediately.’
