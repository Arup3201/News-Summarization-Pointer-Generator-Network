A Mormon mother of seven who was jailed in Mexico on drug smuggling charges walked free last night after a surveillance video cleared her of transporting marijuana.

Yanira Maldonado, 42, of Goodyear, Arizona, was greeted by well-wishers as she left the lockup on the outskirts of Nogales and hugged her husband, Gary, as officials closed the jail doors behind her.

'I'm home! Finally!' Maldonado screamed as she crossed the border back into Arizona.

Maldonado was arrested by the Mexican military last week after they found nearly 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) of pot under her seat on the commercial bus traveling from Mexico to Arizona.

'She lived through a nightmare,' said her attorney, Jose Francisco Benitez Paz.

The case prompted outrage in the U.S. among politicians and pitted the 
conservative Mormon family against a judicial system that has long 
struggled with corruption.

Her release came hours after court 
officials reviewed security footage that showed her and her husband 
boarding a bus in Mexico with only blankets, bottles of water and her 
purse in hand.

The judge determined that she was no longer a suspect and all allegations against her were dropped, according to Benitez Paz.

She spoke briefly to reporters clustered outside the jail, saying: 'Many thanks to everyone, especially my God who let me go free, my family, my children, who with their help, I was able to survive this test.'

With that she and her husband walked 
hand in hand to a waiting car, departing for the U.S. border several 
miles away. Once in Nogales, Arizona, she spoke again about her ordeal.

'I love Mexico,' said Maldonado, who was born there. 'My family is still there. So Mexico... it's not Mexico's fault. It's a few people who you know did this to me.'

But speaking to Arizona's 12 News, she added: 'I'm not coming back to Mexico. It's a slap in the face Mexico has given me after I've defended them when I hear people talk bad about them.'

A judge had until late Friday to 
decide whether to free her or send her to another prison in Mexico while
state officials continued to build their case.

Gary Maldonado said earlier on Thursday he was confident that the video would exonerate his wife, and suggested a man sitting behind them who fled the scene could have been responsible for the drugs.

Mr Maldonado was originally arrested 
after the pot was found under his wife's bus seat on a commercial bus 
traveling from Mexico to Phoenix as they returned from her aunt's funeral.

After Yanira Maldonado begged the 
soldiers to allow her to come along to serve as translator, the military
officials decided to release him and arrest her instead, he said.

Benitez Paz, who had also predicted 
to reporters that the video would lead to her freedom, noted that it was
a fairly sophisticated smuggling effort that included packets of drugs 
attached to the seat bottoms with metal hooks - a task that would have 
been impossible for a passenger like Maldonado.

'All the evidence they have is the drug under the seat,' he said.

The Maldonados were traveling home to
the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear after attending her aunt's funeral in 
the city of Los Mochis when they were arrested.

The couple took the bus because they 
thought it would be safer than driving. They had taken a similar bus 
during a separate trip in Mexico.

Gary Maldonado said authorities 
originally demanded $5,000 for her release, but the bribe fell through.

When the couple tried to defend themselves, military officials told them
the court would sort it out, Gary Maldonado said.

'We never thought this would ever 
happen,' said Gary Maldonado, who doesn't speak Spanish and couldn't 
understand the court proceedings involving his wife.

Gary Maldonado said a man sitting 
behind them on the bus fled during the inspection. He believes the man 
might have been the true owner of the drugs.

'We think she is being framed,' he said. 'The bus was already [en route] from Culiacan' when they boarded.

Yanira Maldonado said she does not think she was necessarily targeted. 'Someone smuggled those in there, and I probably sat in the wrong seat,' she said.

Mexican officials provided local 
media with photos that they said were of the packages Maldonado is 
accused of smuggling. Each was about 5 inches high and 20 inches wide, 
roughly the width of a bus seat. The marijuana was packed into plastic bags and wrapped in tan packing tape.

Yanira
Maldonado said she has been relying on her faith and the support of her
family to keep her spirits up as she fights for her freedom.

'I've
been reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, 
fasting,' Maldonado told CNN before her release. 'And all the support that I've been 
getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there
reaching out to help.'

In the tearful interview - which Maldonado gave from what appears to be an office in Nogales, Mexico, federal prison - the devout Mormon mother said she was shocked when the drugs were found.

'I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,' she said.

'And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did.'

In the interview, Maldonado said she is a religious family woman who was innocent of the charges leveled against her.

'I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. 
I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have. You know, we're not 
rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other 
people,' she said.

Maldonado's family has accused the army officers of framing her in an effort to extort a bribe.

Drug traffickers have increasingly been using passenger buses to move U.S.-bound drugs through Mexico.

In a notorious case, federal police 
in 2011 found half a ton of marijuana hidden under the seats of a bus 
headed to Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. They
arrested the driver and two other people.

Federal agents and soldiers have set 
up checkpoints throughout Mexico's main highways and have routinely 
seized cocaine, marijuana, heroin and other illegal drugs from buses.

When drug suspects are arrested in 
Mexico, they face a murky situation. Mexico's justice system is carried 
out largely in secret, with proceedings done almost entirely in writing.

'Innocent': The Maldonados, who are Mormon, said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs

'Bribes': The couple were told they could pay off the judge because 'that's how things work here'

Four years ago, Mexico decriminalized
the possession of small amounts of marijuana, cocaine and heroin, but 
it still has stiff penalties for drug trafficking.

Mexican law doesn't specify a minimum
or maximum sentence in drug crimes and leaves it up to the judge to 
decide how long the sentence should be, said Jose Luis Manjarrez, a 
spokesman for federal prosecutors in Mexico.

Earlier this week, Benitez presented 
testimony from Yanira Maldonado and from two relatives who accompanied 
the couple to the Los Mochis bus station, and two fellow passengers on 
the bus. All four testified that she had not been carrying any drugs.

He described her as depressed while in jail, but she had not been abused or mistreated.

'She doesn't accept any of the 
accusations that are being made,' he said earlier. 'She is sad because 
of the situation, in which she's being accused of a crime she didn't 
commit.'

On Wednesday, an army lieutenant, a 
private and another sergeant were supposed to appear in court but they 
did not show up. The army did not explain why, Benitez said.

Yanira Maldonado is a naturalized 
U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, her family said. She and Gary 
Maldonado were married one year ago, and they celebrated their 
anniversary while she was jailed.

Jen Psaki, a U.S. State Department 
spokeswoman, said U.S. consulate officials in Mexico had closely 
monitored the case. State Department officials visited her Friday.

'Private citizens who travel abroad 
are expected to, of course, abide by the law in the country where they 
are visiting, and the consular office is in touch when cases like this 
arise to be helpful in advising,' Psaki said in a press briefing in 
Washington on Wednesday ahead of the release.
