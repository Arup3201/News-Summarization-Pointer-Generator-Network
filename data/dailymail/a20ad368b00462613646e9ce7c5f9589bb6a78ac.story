The New York City furrier who sold Joe Namath his show-stopping Super Bowl coat has fielded phone calls from as far away as Dubai since Sunday from customers clamoring for their own coyote.

'He won the Super Bowl twice with this coat,' said Marc Kaufman of Namath, whose eye-catching attire stole the show on Sunday, kicked off days of social media frenzy and has now translated to big business for Kaufman.

'Most people spend $4 million for a 30 second Super Bowl commercial,' Kaufman told MailOnline, 'and I got paid $3,000 for my spot.'

'I have people I haven't spoken to for 30 years calling me': Marc Kaufman (right) is the man behind the now famous coyote coat worn by NFL great Joe Namath during the Super Bowl coin toss on Sunday and the furrier says business has been booming customers clamor for the coat

The furrier said Namath came to him the Wednesday before the Super Bowl, when lows dipped to 14F in New York, looking for something just right.

'He came to me and said, you know, it's supposed to be pretty cold, what do you have,' said Kaufman.

Namath, a longtime fur lover, thought he hit the jackpot with his Super Bowl coat, but it turns out Kaufman's the one who hit it big.

'My website visits have increased 10-fold,' after Namath's memorable appearance, Kaufman said. 'Now we've both won the Super Bowl.'

'Now we've both won the Super Bowl': Kaufman says his visibility has gone through the roof since Namath's appearance, with his website traffic up 1,000 percent

Popular: Kaufman says his Manhattan store's popularity has surged since Namath's Super Bowl coin toss. The furrier's family has been in business since 1910

Great minds: In that P. Diddy shot where he poses in front of a screen that shows the coyote clad Namath, Kaufman says the music mogul is actually wearing one of his store's coats

Kaufman admits that Namath has seen a surge in popularity, as well.

'He's the oldest NFL player to win the Super Bowl a second time,' joked Kaufman.

While the phone is ringing off the hook with people across the globe trying to get their hands on the luxurious coat, Kaufman says even if he had a million, Namath wore that coat on Sunday like no one else could.

'That coat is 100 percent Joe,' he said. 'It has to be a certain look, a sporty look, this piece made the strongest impression.'

That impression was a powerful one judging from the massive response.

'That coat is 100 percent Joe': Fur-loving Namath has seen a flurry of attention the likes of which he hasn't received since his NFL glory days...all because of a Kaufman coat

'He's the oldest NFL player to win the Super Bowl twice': Kaufman has sold to many celebrities but says Namath's appearance has been one of the best for business

'My phone hasn't stopped ringing,' Kaufman said. 'The outreach has been incredible.'

Broadway Joe isn't the only high-profile celebrity who wore a Kaufman coat on game day.

None other than music mogul P. Diddy donned one of the furrier's coats at an event he attended Sunday and even paused to take a pic in front of a massive TV screen alongside the image of Namath during the coin toss.

Diddy even took the time to post that picture on his social media streams, as well as other snaps of him in the fur.

'We sell to quite a few celebrities,' said Kaufman, whose website features the likenesses of Drake, Vivica Fox, 50 Cent and Keisha Cole among many others.

Now, thanks to Namath, he sure to be selling to quite a few more.

Famous furs: P. Diddy (at left with Ashanti) is one of a cadre of celebrities who've flocked to Kaufman Furs. Eva Longoria is also a fan and even more notable names will undoubtedly be visiting Kaufman's Manhattan shop thanks to Namath's Super Bowl appearance
