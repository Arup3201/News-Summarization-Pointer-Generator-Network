Cash: Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury is accused of funneling money towards his Highlands constituency

The Lib Dem minister in charge of the government’s spending cuts is accused of funnelling millions of pounds to pet schemes in his own constituency.

Danny Alexander faces claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere.

Labour claimed there was something ‘very fishy indeed’ about the number of expensive schemes and tax breaks which benefit Mr Alexander’s ‘backyard’.

Since May 2010 several specific projects have received extra money for Mr Alexander’s Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch & Strathspey constituency.

As Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he is effectively George Osborne’s deputy and responsible for signing off all government spending.

In an apparent admission that money is being redirected to northern Scotland, a senior Liberal Democrat told the FT: ‘This is the pay-off. Danny is loyal to George, and this is what he gets in return.’

Cash secured for his seat includes a tax break for ski-lifts, a bail-out for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and more money to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council, the Financial Times said.

Just last week the government 
announced extra funding to help councils cope with the fall out of 
changes to housing benefit rules, which mean some people will lose money
if they have spare bedrooms.

The cash is supposed to help some people who might be affected by the so-called ‘bedroom tax’.

But Highland Council, where all three 
MPs are Lib Dem including Mr Alexander, received £735,000 – 80 per cent 
more than the next highest Aberdeenshire which received £412,000.

In total Highland received 15 per cent of the entire pot available to 21 local authorities.

Deputy council leader David Alston credited meetings with Mr Alexander for securing the money.

Cool deals: Ski lifts in Cairngorm Mountains of the Scottish Highlands have seen their VAT rate cut to just 5 per cent while the CairnGorm mountain railway which runs for two kilometers through the Cairngorm ski area has been exempted from the climate change levy

Also last week Mr Alexander unveiled plans to extend a fuel rebate currently only available to people living on islands to include remote rural areas, including the Highlands.

Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This is very fishy indeed. It seems to be more than a coincidence that, at a time of austerity, funding has gone from the Treasury to so many specific projects that just happen to benefit Danny Alexander’s constituency.

‘The chief secretary seems to be happy pushing through deep tax rises and spending cuts across the rest of the country, so long as his backyard is protected,’ he told the FT.

‘When everyone else is paying higher VAT, is it really a priority to give a big VAT cut to ski-lift operators?,’ Mr Leslie added.

Critics have likened the spending to pork barrel politics.

But challenged over the claims last 
month, Mr Alexander told House magazine: 'I’m an MP from the Highlands, 
that’s true. I’m the first Highlander to occupy Cabinet office for 
several generations.

'I think that the fact that for the 
first time in several generations someone at the top of Government has 
had an understanding of one of the most fragile areas of this country is
a good thing.

'That is what gives me insights into issues that are important.'

However, the list of specific projects in his seat which appear to have benefited from special treatment is long and growing.

In January it was announced that 
£50million of UK government money had been found to help pay for the 
refurbishment of the Caledonian Sleeper, which terminates in Inverness.

At the time Mr Alexander boasted of 
‘having worked hard to deliver £50m of UK government support’, adding: 
‘As someone who uses that route I am looking forward to the excellent 
staff service being matched by facilities which will make enhance the 
trip and make the London sleeper an experience to savour.’

Travel perks: The Caledonian Sleeper, which terminates in Mr Alexander's constituency, received £50million from the government and last week it was announced a fuel rebate for British islands could be extended to remote rural areas, including the Highlands

The Budget in 2012 was dominated by rows over taxes on pasties and caravans. But it also included a VAT cut for ski lifts, to just five per cent, which caused Mr Alexander to boast: ‘CairnGorm has some of the finest snowsports and outdoor facilities in the UK and hopefully this will help the resort maintain its vital role in our economy here in Strathspey.’

In 2011 a tourist train running up the Cairngorm mountain received a tax break, when the Treasury exempted any ‘non-public service rail operators’ from the climate change levy.

However, it is thought that the Cairngorm tourist train was the only project which could qualify.

A spokesman for Mr Alexander said: ‘Liberal Democrats are working hard to make sure this government governs for the whole country and is the first for many years to take rural areas seriously.

'It is right that the Government recognises the significant challenges for those living in rural communities up and down the country and does what it can to support them. 

'This is in addition to the practical help we are delivering for everyone in Britain through the largest income tax cuts in a generation, freezes in fuel duty and freezes in council tax.’
