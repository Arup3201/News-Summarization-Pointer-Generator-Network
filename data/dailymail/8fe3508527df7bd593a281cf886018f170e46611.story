Leicester might have weathered the verbal storm last week but they had no answer here to the muscle of Toulon as the French giants took control of Pool 3.

The cash-rich Top 14 side had let out their anger off the field at Welford Road last week, but yesterday they vented their rage where it matters. Their physical firepower proved too much for the Tigers, who must now set their sights on qualifying as one of the top runners-up.

Leicester made too many mistakes and were blown away inside the opening quarter. The loss of influential lock Brad Thorn did not help, as Leigh Halfpenny exacted revenge for defeat in the reverse fixture with a clinical kicking display, aided by tries from Mathieu Bastareaud and Ali Williams.

‘If you’re inaccurate against Toulon then you’re going to get punished,’ said Richard Cockerill, Leicester’s director of rugby. ‘We were second best and they deserved to win. They were better than us at the breakdown and they were better at the contact point. In big games, tiny moments or opportunities make a big difference. They’re a very big team and we struggled to break them down. Physically we got outdone.

‘There is only so much you can give physically when you’re working on a completely different salary scale to the opposition. They’ve got marquee players across the board, haven’t they? Halfpenny, Habana, Mermoz, Bastareaud… They’ve got a marquee player in every position. They’ve got Juan Smith and then Gorgodze comes off the bench.

‘You can’t be French and European champions when you’re a poor side.’

In this town in the South of France, they like to mix their rugby with a splash of drama, whether it’s the players being marched through a red sea of supporters outside the ground before kick-off, or threats to axe another star. Comic-book tycoon owner Mourad Boudjellal loves a good story and last week it was the Welford Road bust-ups involving Martin Castrogiovanni and Delon Armitage

Only Armitage kept his place in the team, shifting to the wing to accommodate the return of Halfpenny. The Wales full back’s role has been limited since his summer move — making just one line break all season but providing a solid defensive unit and taking over kicking duties from Jonny Wilkinson.

The 25-year-old showed the composure of his predecessor in the opening exchanges. Springbok winger Bryan Habana proved a menace down the left and, following his fifth-minute penalty, Halfpenny converted Ali Williams’s close-range try to build a 10-0 lead in as many minutes.

Leicester were caught cold, their play littered with inaccuracies and indiscipline, gifting their hosts two more kickable penalties. But in the 28th minute, fly-half Owen Williams powered through the Toulon defence with a piece of individual play that should catch the eye of Wales coach Warren Gatland.

The ball was recycled by Ben Youngs and went through three pairs of hands to send Blaine Scully over in the right-hand corner. Leicester went into the break trailing 16-5, fortunate not to be behind by more.

Halfpenny proved he is not quite at the marksman level of Wilkinson when he missed his first shot at goal after the break, before Armitage found himself on the receiving end of a wholehearted shoeing at the breakdown — though the travelling fans offered him little sympathy.

Full back Mathew Tait showed great awareness to use referee George Clancy as an auxiliary blocker, before racing into Toulon territory, but Niki Goneva wasted the chance by cutting inside when he should have pinned his ears back and gone for the line.

That proved to be a key moment as the hosts hit back at the other end, with French centre Bastareaud dashing in under the posts after fly-half Nicholas Sanchez was stopped just inches short.

Williams then kicked his first and only penalty of the afternoon for the visitors, but the crowd booed them for being negative and not going for the try.

The Tigers struggled to make inroads after that and Toulon comfortably kept them at arm’s length to see out the win although they may be frustrated at not securing a bonus point after dominating for long periods.

Leicester had their chances. Mathew Tait ran a perfect line off Leonardo Ghiraldini before the officials failed to award a potentially pivotal line-out after Halfpenny had carried the ball into touch five metres from his line. 

Cockerill was fuming in the coaches’ box and his anger was compounded when Toulon pulled away with a try under the Tigers’ posts as giant centre Bastareaud crossed.

Williams responded with a penalty but Leicester had left themselves with too much to do. The introduction from the bench of Tom Croft was one positive as Irish referee George Clancy continued to frustrate Leicester with some questionable decisions. But ultimately the tourists had no answer to wave after wave of attacks on the Mediterranean coast.
