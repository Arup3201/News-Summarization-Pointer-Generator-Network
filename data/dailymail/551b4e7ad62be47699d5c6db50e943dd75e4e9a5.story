Algeria returned from the World Cup to streets filled with supporters keen to show their appreciation.

The team were paraded around the capital and largest city of Algeria, Algiers, and given a heroes' welcome after making it to the last 16 of the World Cup.

They were dumped out by Germany after extra time in a narrow 2-1 defeat but continued to make a good account of themselves, after forward Islam Slimani revealed the team were to donate their prize money to the poor in Gaza.

It is some gesture to make by the Algeria team, who captured the hearts and minds of many in Brazil.

Slimani, who plays for Sporting Lisbon, said: 'They need it more than us.'

The welcome is in stark contrast to that of England.

There were just a handful of photographers and a class from a primary school on a visit to watch coach Gary Neville lead a deflated group of players down the aircraft steps at Manchester.

There was, though, one Italy fan who made his way to rub salt into the wounds once they landed at Luton later that day.

Attilio Bruno, 53, said at the time: 'England have been very poor. Against England, Italy were phenomenal, I was so proud.

'As for England, I don't blame the manager, it's the players. They have too much money, they are overpaid and they take no pride in wearing the shirt.'

Welcoming committee: Italy fan Attilio Bruno was one of those ready to welcome England home
