Hearing: Latifa Bouabdillah is suing Commerzbank for £1million after the firm sacked her when they found out she was taking her former company to an employment tribunal

A high-flying female City banker was compared to a criminal and sacked from her job because her boss discovered she was suing her old bank for sex discrimination, a tribunal heard.

Latifa Bouabdillah resigned as vice president and director of financial giant Deutsche Bank at the end of 2011 and launched a bid to sue the company for £1million over claims men were promoted ahead of her and received bonuses up to three times larger than hers.

She then moved to rival banking giant Commerzbank AG, but claims she was sacked from the firm when her bosses found out about her sexism case against her former employer when an article was published about it.

Miss Bouabdillah told the Central London Employment Tribunal that she kept her claim secret from her new employers because she feared they wouldn't offer her the £150,000 a year post as head of product engineering and sales in their Exotic Vanilla Funds Team if they knew.

When her new employers found out about the suit they told her that she had put their reputation 'at risk' and that the matter had been escalated to 'very senior' people in the bank's German head office, it is claimed.

In a witness statement submitted to the tribunal she said: 'So I understood that this was causing big issues internally. This worried me a lot. I could see that this was potentially very damaging to my career with the respondent and my career in general.

'They asked me if this was the first time I had sued an institution, I said yes and I am not intending to do it again and that the job with the respondent would allow me to move on with my life.'

She claims she was likened to a common criminal by the bank's senior HR partner Nigel Marsden and was left feeling 'distressed, demeaned and humiliated' by her bosses who interrogated her, it was said.

She said: 'Towards the end of the conversation Nigel compared me to someone who had been shoplifting and said that should be disclosed.

'I was shocked and said how could he compare me to a shoplifter, and said there was no similarity between my case and shoplifting.

'I said that I was the victim in my 
claims. I said that I didn't understand why this was such an issue for 
them. It seemed to me that they were just looking for an excuse to 
dismiss me.

'I felt 
rejected. People who had been very sympathetic had completely changed, 
so I said I would leave the bank if they wanted me to.

'The
meeting upset me a lot. I had been compared to a criminal. I felt that 
for him I was guilty until proven innocent. I left the meeting feeling 
terrible, humiliated and very worried about my future.'

Taking action: Ms Bouabdillah launched a bid to sue Deutsche Bank for sexual discrimination over claims men received bonuses three times larger than hers

Suing: Latifa Bouabdillah leaves Kingsway Employment tribunal in London today. The former vice president and director is suing Commerzbank for £1 million saying male colleagues got up to three times the bonus she got

At a meeting on June 11th last year, Miss Bouabdillah was dismissed from her job - less than a month after she was appointed to the post.

She is now suing the bank for sex discrimination and victimisation.

Commerzbank denies the allegations and claims it dismissed the banker because she had broken their trust.

In a statement Guy Middleton, head of 
sales trading at the Exotic Vanilla Funds Team, said he was suspicious 
about why she had left Deutsche Bank and repeatedly asked her 
recruitment consultant, but was reassured it was because she wanted to 
move to a smaller team.

New case: Ms Bouabdillah was then sacked by her new employer Commerzbank AG when they found out about the case. She is now suing the firm for unfair dismissal

He said: 'I was initially unsure whether Latifa should remain in the team as I initially thought that the trust between her and the team might be recoverable.

'But as time went on I felt that she had made a conscious and considered decision to withhold information which made me feel that she could no longer be trusted.'

The hearing has been adjourned while the tribunal considers its judgement.

A Commerzbank spokesman said: 'We believe this claim has no merit and are defending it accordingly.

'Ms Bouabdillah’s employment was terminated because of a clear breach of trust and confidence by the employee.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
