Australia will see the largest overhaul of national security laws in a decade, as laws are rolled that could allow Australian police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries, disrupt suspect computer networks and suspend people’s passports.

The first in a raft of changes to national security legislation will be presented to parliament on July 14 and they will continue to be announced over coming months.

These will be the most significant changes to security laws in Australia since the anti-terrorism laws introduced by John Howard in 2005.

The first set of reforms, to be put before parliament in a fortnight, will allow ASIO to use third-party computers under warrant and to extend ASIO’s power to target and disrupt computer networks that suspected of use by terrorists, reported The Australian.

Changes to laws regarding the collection of foreign evidence could allow the Australian Federal Police to conduct surveillance operations in foreign countries and tender the evidence in Australian courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases.

The law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war, like Syria, or ‘failed states’ like Somalia.

The laws draw from government reports released over the past 18 months and recommendations from the outgoing National Security Legislation Monitor Bret Walker.

The laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against Australians who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), pictured marching in Syria

Other changes main include the power to suspend people’s passports, in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice, and allowing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to pass on intelligence about Australians to its domestic counterpart, ASIO, under certain circumstances.

These changes would assist with the investigation and prosecution of Australians who travel abroad to engage in foreign conflicts, such as in Syria and Iraq.

The changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism.

The announcement comes as another Australian announced he would be going to Syria to join with his 'brothers' in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS).

The Australian Muslim convert who boasts about being the third most 'liked' extremist preacher on Facebook, announced on social media that he would be joining the jihad.
