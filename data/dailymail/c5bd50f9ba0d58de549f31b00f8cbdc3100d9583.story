West Ham's season will depend on the fitness of striker Andy Carroll, according to captain Kevin Nolan.

Carroll made just 15 appearances in the Premier League last year, scoring twice, after injuries took their toll and the Hammers finished 13th.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce was told to up the entertainment at Upton Park, and brought in £12million-signing Enner Valencia, while Carroll has been keeping himself fit over the summer.

And Nolan thinks their striker's fitness will make or break their campaign.

'We'll have the big man available for the whole of the season and that will be a big thing for us,' said the skipper, as reported by The Sun.

'I'm confident that if we can keep Andy fit, as well as introducing the signings we have brought in, this year is going to be a very good one for us.'
