A cluster of towering concrete blocks that loom over London's Elephant and Castle will now join a list of national treasures, as they've been awarded Grade II listed status.

Ernö Goldfinger's Metro Central Heights, has been branded 'soulless' and one of the 'worst examples of post-war development'.

But that has not stopped Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey giving the building the prestigious award.

Once branded 'soulless', the building has now been given special status because of its high caliibre design

The influential architect, who was renowned for his 'austere' projects, angered James Bond author Ian Fleming so much with his designs that the novelist named one of his most famous villains after him.

Fleming had been among the many unhappy objectors to the pre-war demolition of some Hampstead cottages which were removed to make way for Goldfinger's house in Willow Road.

Erno Goldfinger considered the Metro Central Heights one of his most significant achievements

The Budapest-born architect threatened to sue who Goldfinger was published in 1959, which prompted Fleming to threaten to rename the character 'Goldprick', but eventually he climbed down and dropped his threat.

Built between 1959 and 1967 and  originally called Alexander Fleming House, the south London block housed the Department of Health and Social Security until 1989.

But the office block became known as sick building syndrome - where inhabitants suffer health problems linked to spending time inside it - and staff were moved out in the early 1990s to a new headquarters across the road.

It remained empty and was considered for demolition, but it was converted to residential use in 2002.

The Design Museum said: 'His monumental 1959-1963 scheme for Elephant & Castle in south London is frequently cited as one of the worst examples of soulless post-war developments.'

But this hasn't stopped English Heritage advising that the structure should not enjoy protected status.

Ed Vaizey said: Goldfinger considered this to be his most significant work.

'Acclaimed when it was first built, it subsequently divided opinion but has now – 25 years after first being put forward for listing – clearly passed the test of time.

'I am pleased now to be able to give it the recognition it deserves.

Villain Auric Goldfinger was named after the architect, who incurred the wrath of Ian Fleming with his austere designs

Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of 
English Heritage said: 'Built by distinguished architect Ernö 
Goldfinger, Metro Central Heights is an excellent example of high 
calibre post-war architecture.

'An accomplished building, it has proved highly influential for designs which followed.

Trellick Tower took years for Londoners - and especially those living there - to warm to it

'We are pleased that the Heritage Minister agrees with our advice and has listed it at Grade II.

Grade II buildings are nationally important and of special interest; 92 per cent of all listed buildings are in this class and it is the most likely grade of listing for a home owner.

However there is some hope for those who view the block as a blot, rather than a treasure - listing does not protect the building.

Instead, it means that listed building consent must be applied for in order to make any changes to that building which might affect its special interest.  

Listed buildings can be altered, extended and sometimes even demolished within government planning guidance.

An influential figure in the British modern movement, Goldfinger studied architecture in Paris, the Design Museum said.

But his works would often divide residents and critics' opinions.

He moved to London in 1934, attracting praise for some projects, notably his Hampstead home, but drawing controversy for ambitious schemes at Elephant and Castle and Poplar.

The Trellick Tower in west London, is a prime example of his provoking work.

Popular though Trellick is today, it took years for Londoners – and especially those living there – to warm to it, and other Goldfinger projects proved equally contentious.
