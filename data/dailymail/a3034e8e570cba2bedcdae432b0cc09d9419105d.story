Jimmy Bullard will be getting a swift visit from the fashion police after his interesting choice of wardrobe during Arsenal's FA Cup clash with Hull on Sunday night. 

Appearing as a pundit for BBC's live coverage, the former Hull midfielder turned up sporting a black dinner jacket and silk shirt combo.

To complete the Disco Fever look, Bullard had unbuttoned his shirt far enough to reveal a silver pendant dangling around his neck as he unwittingly flashed a hint of midriff. We can't help but think that comedy lothiario and style eccentric Keith Lemon would have been immensely proud of his efforts.

Bullard took to social media to see the reaction he was getting, joking that he thought he'd 'broken Twitter'

Looking more like he'd taken a wrong turn on his way to the Strictly Come Dancing set, Bullard laughed it off as he sat in stark contrast to the suited-and-booted Alan Shearer smiling beside him.

Taking to social media to see how well his outfit was going down with the audience, the 36-year-old joked: ‘Think my shirt has broken my Twitter’.

The Gunners went on to beat Bullard's former side in a convincing 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium with goals from Per Mertesacker and Alexis Sanchez.
