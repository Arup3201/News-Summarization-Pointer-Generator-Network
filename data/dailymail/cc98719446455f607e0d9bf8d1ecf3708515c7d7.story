A Maryland man was convicted of sexually assaulting four men he met at bars during beer pong tournaments and lured to his home, taking photographs of his victims while they were incapacitated. 

Joey Poindexter, 40, from Gaithersburg, is believed to have preyed on young men for 10 years, according to investigators. 

But it wasn't until 2013 that allegations first emerged, when a student claimed the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a  pub during a tournament for the popular drinking game.

The case against Poindexter (pictured) did not begin to build until 2013, when a student alleged the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a pub during a tournament for the popular drinking game

The student  didn't remember anything when he woke up in Poindexter's home the next morning and went to the police, who asked him to call the man and record the conversation, according to NBC Washington. 

Poindexter was reluctant to admit anything over the phone, telling the victim 'no matter what did or didn't happen, like I said, I was pretty trashed'. 

'And if it makes you feel any better, I don't have any AIDS if anything did happen.' 

But when Poindexter met with the victim, who was wearing a wire, in person, he admitted they had sex while the student was intoxicated but said it was consensual.

The student told police Poindexter had bought him beer, shots and a Long Island Ice Tea the night they met.

Surveillance images from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand up as Poindexter led him out the door on the night of the assault, according to the Washington Post.  

And police found a video Poindexter had recorded that night of the two in his shower - which was later shown in court - on his phone. 

One anonymous juror told the Washington Post it 'seemed pretty clear' that Poindexter had been 'in a predatory state'. 

The college student's case was just the beginning. Police found pictures of a number of men 'in various states of consciousness' on Poindexter's cell phone. 

And they identified at least 12 other victims from photographs that were stored on his hard drive. 

Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's home while drunk.

Poindexter was well-known on the tournament circuit and attended a number of beer pong competitions at bars throughout the D.C. and Baltimore area

Officers said all three victims had been drunk, and possibly drugged.  

Poindexter was convicted of sexually assaulting the four men this week and will be sentenced on March 20. 

Juror Jennifer Davis said the jury were 'disgusted to know that someone of that age' would prey on young adults.  

Poindexter was well-known on the tournament circuit and attended a number of beer pong competitions at bars throughout the D.C. and Baltimore area, as well as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, Dallas, Virginia Beach and Salt Lake City. 

Police have urged other potential victims to come forward and contact the Montgomery County Special Victims Unit.
