Brett Cayzer, 52, has been banned from carrying bricks by magistrates after drunkenly attacking a police station and emergency cars

A man who smashed up a police station and three emergency vehicles in a drunken rampage has been banned from carrying bricks by magistrates. 

The bizarre criminal behaviour order, a new form of Asbo, has been handed to Brett Cayzer, 52, after he wrecked three 999 vehicles - just three days after facing court for attacking a police station.

Cayzer hurled two bricks through glass partitions at the police base in Ipswich, Suffolk, but was given a conditional discharge on Monday November 24. 

But, just three days after that hearing, he then used another brick to smash the windows and wing mirrors of two police cars and a paramedic's rapid response vehicle.

He said later that he'd only targeted the medical emergency vehicle because he thought it was a police car, South East Suffolk magistrates' court, Ipswich, heard.

Ian Devine, prosecuting, said that shortly after midnight on Thursday police and a paramedic were treating a victim of an assault in the town when Cayzer bricked their vehicles.

He told officers after discovering that one of his vendetta targets belonged to the ambulance service: 'The reason I smashed them was because they were police vehicles.

'I didn't actually realise it was a paramedic's car otherwise I wouldn't have touched it.

'I thought it was a police car.'

Mr Devine said Cayzer was drunk both when he smashed up the emergency service vehicles and the police station on November 6.

Sue Threadkell, defending, said he bitterly resented police after they upset him as he cared for his elderly dementia-stricken mother.

She said Cayzer had gone to get fish and chips for her lunch one day when an officer spotted him and wanted to talk to him.

The serial offender asked to go home first to make sure his forgetful mother would not wander off, said Mrs Threadkell.

But he said the policeman took Cayzer straight to the police station instead.

Mrs Threadkell said: 'He wanted to go home to ensure the door was locked but that wasn't done and that made him bear a grudge.'

Cayzer's seriously ill mother died five weeks ago, magistrates heard.

The former continental lorry driver is now homeless because he left his bedsit to move into his mother's rented bungalow in Ipswich.

'When his mother passed away he wasn't entitled to remain in the accommodation and because he had given up his flat to care for his mother he had made himself intentionally homeless so he ended up on the streets,' added Mrs Threadkell.

Magistrates jailed Cayzer, who admitted criminal damage, for 18 weeks.He was also made subject to a criminal behaviour order which bans him carrying bricks or open containers of alcohol in Ipswich

He was also made subject to a criminal behaviour order which bans him carrying bricks or open containers of alcohol in Ipswich.

Ipswich-based Ch Insp Steve Denham, of Suffolk Police, slammed Cayzer after the case as he branded him 'senseless'.

He said: 'This behaviour towards the police is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

'Not only have his senseless actions affected the police officers present but have also had a major impact on equipment, services and police time, which could have been used dealing with other community issues.'
