At age 19, Rebecca Musser was 'given away' by her father and married to Rulon Jeffs, the 85-year-old leader of an extremist polygamist Mormon sect later led by his notorious son Warren.

For seven years, she was 'sexually violated' by the elderly man, who had 64 other wives - terrified to resist his physical advances.

When he died in 2002, age 92, she escaped the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and began helping authorities prosecute members of the church. She testified 20 times and helped federal prosecutors win 11 convictions.

Among those sent to prison with the help of her testimony was Warren Jeffs, who took over leadership of the FLDS church after his father's death.

But before she broke free, her husband owned her -- 'body and soul.'

Miss Musser, now 36, opened up publicly for the first time about her 26-year ordeal inside the close-knit extremist organization.

'My father sold my innocence,' she told an audience, the Deseret News reported.

'My life there was a constant state of fear, unknown... silence.'

Miss Musser said she is speaking out now to offer inspiration to women everywhere. However, she spent nearly a decade working with authorities to held the women she grew up with in the tightly-controlled FLDS church.

'She asked for assistance in leaving the community, and a deputy responded and facilitated that request,' he said.

During her marriage to Rulon Jeffs she was terrified of disobeying him. The church taught that followers they could enter heaven only by following their leader, whom they taught was a divinely-inspired prophet.

She couldn't cut her hair and couldn't choose what clothes to wear.

'After seven years of continual sexual violations, I'd had enough,' Miss Musser said, according to the News.

'Give me hell because I don't want that heaven.'

Free woman: When her husband died, age 92, she slipped out of the FLDS compound under cover of darkness and fled -- deciding she no longer wanted to live under the strictures of the extremist church

In the cover of darkness, she slipped past the armed guards and fled, knowing that leaders of the sect would drag her back to the compound if she was caught.

On the outside, Miss Musser said she found herself. Helping the federal government prosecute 11 members of the church allowed her to cope with the pain of adjusting to life outside the compound.

She showed up to to testify against Warren Jeffs and other FLDS members in a striking red dress. It was a show of defiance to a religious leader who banned followers from wearing the color.

Warren Jeffs was convicted in August 2011 of raping a two girls, age 15 and 12, who were his 'spiritual wives.'

The first time Miss Musser testified against him was in 2007, when he was convicted of accessory to rape after he married off Alyssa Wall, Miss Musser's 14-year-old sister, to an older man.

Warren Jeffs, who reportedly had as many as 80 wives, is serving life plus ten years in a Texas prison.
