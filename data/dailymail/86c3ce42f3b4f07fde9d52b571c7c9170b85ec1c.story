Weighing about the same as a three-year-old child and containing 12,000 calories this dinner could feed a whole family at Christmas... but is meant to be for just one person.

The seven-kilogramme meal consists of a turkey crown filled with pork and orange stuffing, a whole chicken, whole duck, four Yorkshire puddings and ten each of new potatoes, roast potatoes and pigs in blankets, and equal measures of carrots, sprouts and squash 

The £56 challenge is so gargantuan that the restaurant serving it has drawn up a disclaimer warning those with heart conditions or underlying illnesses about the dangers of such a calorific meal - but if diners can get through the entire thing in an hour they get the whole lot free.

A case for Man vs Food:The seven-kilogramme meal is a turkey crown filled with pork and orange stuffing, a whole chicken, duck, Yorkshire puddings and ten each of new potatoes, roast potatoes and pigs in blankets

The Real 3-Bird Challenge is the brainchild of  Sarah Bird who runs The Black Bull restaurant in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

The Christmas dinner challenge takes a total of four hours to assemble, prepare and cook, and three chefs to make it.

Ms Bird said: 'We have made a meal for four grown men or a Christmas dinner for a whole family but one lucky challenger has got to eat it all in an hour. 

'We reckon it adds up to about 12,000 calories. We are making disclaimers because we want to be responsible about this- even if it is a bit of fun in the run up to Christmas. Our disclaimers always state that challenges can only be undertaken by those 18 and above.

The restaurant has had 3,000 likes on Facebook since they posted the picture on their page 

The meal, which can feed four grown men, costs £56 but if diners can finish it in an hour they get it free

The restaurant chain also serves an 80oz steak challenge for £54 and a whole cake challenge.

''This is the biggest challenge we have done yet and 12,000 calories is obviously several times the recommended daily intake for just one man. We will have the first aid kit on standby,' Ms Bird continued. 

Since posting a photo of the gigantic meal, their Facebook page has been inundated with people linking their friends and boasting that they can defeat the platter.

Facebook follower Phil Simcox wrote: 'If that's not promoting obesity I don't know what is.'  

'I have had a go at it and I didn't even make a dent. We have had 3,000 likes on Facebook since we put it up  and have had quite a few people interested or egging their friends on,' Ms Bird continued.

'Everyone has been sharing the picture and getting their friends on board. It is really exciting. We are stating that you have to order this 24 hours in advance so we have enough time to make it.

'The meat itself adds up to about 100 ounces -  it is massive. It weighs about the same as a three-year-old.'

'If anyone actually manages it they get the whole thing for free. I really want someone to finish it all but I think it might just be a bit big. It would be great to get a professional eater in and see how they handle it.'

'We just love doing these challenges and we thought it would be great to do a challenge in the run up to Christmas.

'I think we have definitely made the largest Man vs Food Christmas dinner in the UK. I think if anyone manages to finish it they will be put off Christmas dinner for life. '
