From a distance this globe may look like any other but it is in fact made from thousands of matchsticks.

Created by artist Andy Yoder, 56, from Cleveland, Ohio, the incredible creation is built from 300,000 individual matchsticks glued together facing outwards.

Each of the matches was hand painted and took two years to build. The matches were also coated in flame retardant to make sure the artwork didn't burst into flames.

This sculpture, which measures 43 inches around, was made byÂ  artist Andy Yoder from 300,000 matchsticks

The New York artist took two years to paint the tip of each matchstick before gluing them together

New York-based artist Yoder used satellite images of the Earth during Hurricane Sandy as a basis for the sculpture as well as a second-hand desktop globe to help map the contours of each country.

Built in his backyard studio, the striking piece of art weighs more than 90kg and measures 43 inches in diameter.

Andy said 'I didn't have an "aha" moment, but instead the idea to build a globe made from matchsticks came to me as an subconscious idea, probably when I was half asleep or in a dream like state.

Hanging from the ceiling in Mr Yoder's backyard studio, the artwork weighs nearly 200lb (90kg, left). Viewed from a distance the highly detailed work appears just like genuine pictures of the Earth (right)

Not wanting his prized creation to burst into flames, Mr Yoder dipped each match in flame retardant

'I bought a desktop globe at a second hand store to help map the globe and used the latitude and longitude lines as a grid that I could transfer to my larger model.

'Each square of the grid was numbered, so I could copy the contours of the continents square by square.

'When people see my work, they become wide eyed with gaping mouths and instantly they want to touch it.

The sculpture also features the infamous Hurricane Sandy (left) which brought New York to a standstill, as Mr Yoder worked from satellite images (right) of the storm as it hit the West Coast

While the West Coast is modelled on satellite images, the rest of the work was created from a desktop globe

Mr Yoder says the work, which consumed him for four days a week for two years, is the most labour-intensive he has ever done

'Luckily, my globe isn't flammable, I painted the tips by dipping 5 matchsticks at a time in a mixture of paint, water and flame retardant.

'Although I have tried many large scale art installations in the past, this is by far the most work intensive and time consuming project I have ever done.'
