You'd be forgiven for thinking this dramatic images was a scene from a Harry Potter film as a man holds up his arm to a magnificent, shimmering orb suspended above him.

But this picture was actually taken in Finland, deep in the heart of 'The Aurora Zone'.

This is one of the best places in the world to see the incredible Aurora Borealis, a 'once in a lifetime' sight for many.

Natural magic: The spectacular moment a stargazer appears to hold a shimmering orb aloft in 'The Aurora Zone'­ in Finland

The photograph was taken by Antti Pietakainen, from The Aurora Zone - a company offering holidays across Northern Scandinavia.

The
 Aurora is named after the Roman goddess of dawn and is a natural light 
display caused by the collision of energetic charged particles with 
atoms in the high altitude atmosphere. 

As highly charged 
electrons from solar wind enter the upper atmosphere, they encounter atoms of 
oxygen and nitrogen at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles above the earth's 
surface.

The
 colour of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude 
of the meeting. Green and reds are found at higher altitudes, while blue,
 purple and violets are lower.

Magical scene:The aurora borealis (or the northern lights), is named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas
