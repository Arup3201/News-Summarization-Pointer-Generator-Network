Before Nikki Reed starred in the $3.3 billion dollar Twilight franchise, the now-26-year-old actress was more of a regular at McDonalds than Nobu - and she wasn't exactly splurging on super-size meals.

'I grew up eating off the dollar menu at every fast food restaurant,' she told Yahoo Style. 'When you have a single mother that makes $15,000 a year for her two kids in a major city like Los Angeles, money runs out quickly.'

If her mother could have afforded organic vegetables she would have bought them, Nikki says, adding that they simply didn't have the money to be healthy while she was growing up.

Kids meals: Nikki Reed, 26, says her family couldn't afford to buy healthy food while she was growing up in LA, so she often ate off the dollar menu at fast food restuarants

That's why Nikki and her fiancé Ian Somerhalder, 36, who have been engaged since January, became involved with US-based Thrive Market, a 'socially conscious online store' that sells natural and organic products at wholesale prices.

For every paid membership, the site offers a free one to a low-income family - and so far has signed up 650,000 members since November 2014.

Nikki's upbringing also encouraged her to develop a love of animals; the big screen star often adopts pets from shelters, or adopts and fosters them with Ian and her mother.

'My mom deserves every bit of credit,' Nikki says. 'She basically takes in any and everything that has a heartbeat.'

Nikki followed suit, fostering and adopting animals during the past decade, including dogs, cats, horses, and even rats.

More recently, Nikki built a guest house on her LA property where her mom could live and help her take care of her many pets.

The actress even testified at California’s State Capitol in early March in support of Assembly Bill 147, or the Research Animal Adoption Bill, which would help animals that have been tested on find homes.

While fans may be surprised that Nikki dedicates so much of her time to her furry friends, it's actually a lot closer to her initial career dreams than acting - her next film, The Sunday Horse, comes out later this year - producing - she has a new production company with Ian - and directing - her documentary Think Normal appeared on ESPN last year.

'I wanted to be a vet and take care of animals,' says the star, who made her acting debut as a teenager in the indie film Thirteen. 'I didn't ever think of myself as an actress.'
