The ambulance service attended the incident and took the 20-year-old victim to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

However, efforts to save her were not successful.

Craig Bell, 24, who lives in the city centre, told the paper: 'I'm shocked it's happened, especially at a time when there would have been loads of people around. I just feel for the poor girl and her family.'

Anyone who witnessed the incident or had any information was asked to call police on 101, quoting incident 340 of February 18.
