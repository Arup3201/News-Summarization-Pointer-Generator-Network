Police ignored a mother's repeated plea for protection from her rapist boyfriend who attacked her with a claw hammer while her young children looked on, an independent watchdog has found.

Mother-of-two Charmaine, who has withheld her surname, pleaded for protection from officers after 'fearing for her life' following a previous assault from her partner Christopher Veal.

However, her desperate pleas went unanswered and she was horrifically assaulted by Veal at her home in Cardiff, Wales in August 2011.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is now set to issue a damning report on how she was ‘let down’ by police, who dropped her home minutes before she was subjected to the attack.

She had gone to her local police station to report Veal for a previous assault, saying she feared for her life and ‘did not want to get beaten any more’ - but officers failed to carry out proper background checks and drove her home.

Minutes later the rapist broke in and attacked Charmaine in front of her 10-year-old daughter and 16-month-old son.

Veal was recalled to prison after the attack, but committed suicide in jail two months later - ahead of his trial.

Charmaine said her children had been exposed to a ‘horror film’ during the assault, which left her with serious facial and head injuries and broken ribs.

She told Channel 4 News: ‘There was my partner with a claw hammer. He said “come here you b***h” and he smashed me with the hammer.

‘He kept hitting me. I tried to run out onto the veranda to scream. And while he told my daughter to stop her brother from screaming, he carried on hitting me.

‘I remember him standing behind me and the hammer coming in the front of my face and knocking my teeth out.’

She lost consciousness before Veal dialled 999 and shouted "get the police now. There’s been a murder".

Records showed Veal was a registered sex offender with dangerous tendencies, and had convictions for rape, false imprisonment, weapon possession and wounding.

The IPCC’s report said there had been ‘limited efforts’ to apprehend Veal.

Charmaine said: 'They knew he was a rapist... and they sent me home. I trusted them to look after me and my children. I’ve been let down. My children have been let down. They’ve seen some horror film which no children should have ever seen.’

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is now set to issue a damning report on how Charmaine was 'let down' by South Wales Police, after officers dropped her home minutes before she was attacked

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now published a damning report into the matter - saying South Wales Police did not give the case any urgency or priority.

Commissioner Jan Williams said: ‘No-one took overall supervision and this failure to join the dots effectively put this woman and her children at serious risk.

‘South Wales Police had the systems and intelligence in place to flag up the danger that this offender presented, but at various stages officers failed to access that information and to assess that risk properly.’

Veal was released on licence from prison for previous offences in 2007 - and later began a relationship with Charmaine who said she had ‘no idea’ of the extent of her partner's criminal past.

However, she began to feel vulnerable as the months went on and in August 26, 2011, made a statement to police saying Veal had assaulted her.

The IPCC said South Wales Police could not immediately find Veal at the time.

Three days later, while away from her home, the woman contacted officers again saying Veal had been at her address insisting she drop the charges against him.

An IPCC report said: ‘She asked for police to meet her (because)... she felt unable to return home.

‘With her two young children, she waited for over two hours for the police to arrive.

‘She was taken to a police station, where she made a further statement. An officer later drove the woman and her children home. Within minutes of the officer leaving, the partner forced entry into the locked flat and attacked the woman with a hammer.’

The IPCC said there had been a ‘continuing thread of low level performance’ by police officers and 999 operators in the lead up to the attack and said one officer had a case to answer for misconduct.

‘South Wales Police had the systems and 
intelligence in place to flag up the danger that this offender 
presented, but at various stages officers failed to access that 
information and to assess that risk properly.’

Another officer and three control room staff should also be subject to management over poor performance, its investigation concluded.

It also said the force - which is the biggest in Wales - should have referred the matter to the IPCC at the time it happened.

The IPCC said it was only made aware of the issue when local MP Susan Elan Jones complained on the woman's behalf.

‘The police only made limited efforts to apprehend a potentially violent sex offender,’ the IPCC said.

‘Police had correctly documented and recorded all their intelligence, but did not use that information well in dealing with the escalating situation.

‘A notice to the Probation Service may not have prevented the serious assault, but it could have resulted in the offender's licence being revoked and his swift return to custody.’

The watchdog has recommended South Wales Police reviews its training for domestic violence situations - especially where children are involved.

South Wales Police deputy chief constable Matt Jukes said: ‘It is clear we did not provide the victim in this case and her children with the care and protection that she needed at a critical time and we are sincerely sorry for that.

‘Over recent years we have worked incredibly hard to improve our response to incidents of domestic abuse.

‘While this has come too late to support the victim in this case, we have good evidence it is providing a much improved response to victims of domestic abuse now, helping to keep them safe.’

South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said: ‘The events should not have happened as they did. The deputy chief constable made that absolutely clear.

‘The thing is there have been failures in the past, which is why the chief constable made tackling violence against women and girls such a high priority in the police and crime plan.’
