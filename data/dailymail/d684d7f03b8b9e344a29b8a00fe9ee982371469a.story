The owners of a bed and breakfast were today facing a bill of more than £400,000 after a giant sink hole opened up just feet from their front door.

Owners Phil, 51, and Helen Tester, 49, watched in horror as the giant gap appeared at The Laurals B&B in Oakamoor, Staffordshire, and continued to grow until it was 16ft wide.

Now the couple, whose B&B is under threat from subsidence, are pouring hundreds of tonnes of rubble into the 26ft deep hole in an attempt to shore up the car park.

Rocky road: The sink hole had opened up where the couple normally parked their cars and where workmen who were shoring up a recent landslide had recently been busy with a JCB

Shock: Owners Phil, 51, and Helen Tester, 49, watched in horror as the giant gap appeared at The Laurals in Oakamoor, Staffordshire, and continued to grow until it was 16ft wide

Contractors spotted the tarmac begin to sag early on Thursday morning. The Testers raced outside just in time to see that sag begin to turn into a chasm through the day.

Fortunately the beginnings of the collapse were spotted just in time to get everyone and the equipment away from the area.

Grandfather-of-one Mr Tester and his wife Mrs Tester have been forced to close the B&B until October and now face handing a bill for hundreds of thousands of pounds over to their insurers.

Mr Tester said: ‘It came as a huge shock when I saw it. The landslide has already damaged parts of the car park and the property so to have this additional problem appear was not appreciated.

'It came as a huge shock when I saw it... We used to park our cars on that spot'

‘We used to park our cars on that spot and there was some equipment there on Wednesday, so we were very lucky nothing or nobody fell in.

‘It is at least eight metres deep and after it was getting wider all through the night, it is about four metres wide now. As you can imagine, we didn't get much sleep last night.

‘It has been a bit of a stressful two weeks here. Thursday was probably the low point of our lives. We have had to close, refund our guests and cancel all of our plans because of this.

Adding to their problems: The landslide had already damaged parts of the car park and the property

Working hard: Mr Tester said the insurers 'have been great and we have geological engineers on site trying to find out what can be done'

‘Thankfully our insurers have been great and we have geological engineers on site trying to find out what can be done.’

'In the end it was not far away from out front door, just a matter of feet. I am just so glad there was no one there at the time'

Helen Tester

Mrs Tester added: ‘Today [Saturday] they are putting another 40 tonnes of rubble into the hole. That follows 40 yesterday and another 40 later. It will be hundreds of tonnes by the time it is safe.

‘Then they will drill a bore hold down to solid rock and fill it with concrete to shore everything up.

'My parents live downstairs so we've just been worrying about them as the hole grew closer and closer. In the end it was not far away from out front door, just a matter of feet.

‘I am just so glad there was no one there at the time. The workmen have been working in that area with their equipment, so if it had opened up earlier I dread to think what might have happened.’
