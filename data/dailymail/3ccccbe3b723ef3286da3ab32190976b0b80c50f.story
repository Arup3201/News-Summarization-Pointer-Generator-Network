Dogs might be fussier about their dinner than most owners give them credit for.

Argentine researchers have discovered that dogs eavesdrop on what their owners are saying about their food, in order to decide whether they want to eat it or not.

They conducted a series of experiments to find that dogs watch and listen to the way people interact with one another to work out who will provide the tastier meal.

Researchers found dogs use information gleaned from the interactions of one human with another. In picture A a man tells the woman how tasty the cornflakes were, in B he returns the 'disgusting' cereal and in C the dog approaches the woman with the tastier cornflakes

The research, described in the PLoS journal, builds on another study, which demonstrated that dogs carefully watch the behaviour and emotions of people.

The new study, conducted by scientists at the University of Buenos Aires, found dogs use information gleaned from the interactions of one human with another, instead of a person’s direct interaction with them.

Scientists are undecided about how much dogs really understand the actions of humans

In the experiment, dogs watched a man ask two different women for a bowl of cornflakes.

While both women supplied the man with cornflakes, he told one woman how delicious the cereal was and returned the bowl with the same food in it to the other woman, telling her it was disgusting.

After his interactions with the women, he left and a dog that had been watching the exchange was let off its lead.

The animal preferred the woman who had provided the 'tasty' cereal.

However, in some repetitions of the test some  dogs did not approach either of the women, suggesting that the outcome of the experiment was not entirely clear cut.

Other studies have found that puppies can tell if their owner is happy by looking at their facial expression, compared with a neutral one, Popular Science reported.

Dogs have also been found to prefer people who share food, and in one study by the University of London, Goldsmiths, sought out the company of crying people instead of those who talked or hummed.

Researchers found the canines sniffed, nuzzled and licked crying strangers.

While there is an argument that dogs 
only watch interactions between people, instead of a person’s reaction 
to an object, a previous study discovered that dogs are able to pick out
boxes that excited a person.

However, many scientists are undecided about how much dogs really understand the actions of humans.
