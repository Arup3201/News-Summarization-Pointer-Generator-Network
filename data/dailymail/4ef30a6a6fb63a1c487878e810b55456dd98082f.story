It was widely reported that Kanye West struggled with the loss of his mother Donda when she died of complications from cosmetic surgery in 2007.

And now in an upcoming and very candid interview with the mother of girlfriend Kim Kardashian, Kanye West reveals the depths of despair he went through, telling Kris Jenner on her talk show that he 'felt like he had nothing to live for'.

But the rapper says his saving grace came in the form of Kris's daughter Kim and the couple's new baby girl North West.

Opening up for the first time about his new family, the media shy 36-year-old says in a sneak peek clip of the muchanticipated sit down, that before Kim came along he was constantly: 'putting his life at risk' .

'After I lost my mother, there were times... Well I put myself at risk,'' he explains to Kris in the forthcoming interview. 'I felt like sometimes I didn't have something to live for.'

Kanye says that everything changed when Kim came into his life.

Not long after the pair confirmed they were dating, they also found out they were expecting a child.

Little North West arrived into the world just two months ago and Kanye says his new family has completely changed his life.

'Now I have two really special people to live for. A whole family to live for. A whole world to live for,' he explains during the emotional interview.

During his appearance on the show, Kanye also addresses the criticism he has received for being in a relationship with media-loving Kim.

He says no matter what people say, his partner is worth every bit of it, with the 808s & Heartbreak star gushing about his great 'love' for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star.

'I had people say "this is going to damage your credibility as an artist or a designer,"' Kanye explains. 'But I say "I don't care, I love this woman."

'Or someone could say, "When the paparazzi surrounds you... everyone knows you don't like the paparazzi. Why would you be with this person?" he adds.

Emotional: At times, both Kanye and Kris both get emotional during the sit-down

Lots of laughs: The pair also share lots of laughs during the interview

'And I say "I am being with this person because, you know, I love this person and she is worth it to me.'

The Grammy Award winning rapper says he was taught by his late grandfather, Portwood Williams Senior, who passed away at the age of 98 on August 10, that life is all about having 'joy'.

'My grandfather just passed and he's whole thing... it was never about money and it was never about popularity. His whole thing was joy,' Kanye says.

So happy: Kim and Kanye have been dating since April 2012

'Just joy. Like having joy in his life. And she's (Kim) my joy and she brought my new joy into this world.

'And there is no paparazzi and no blog comment... there is nothing that is going to take that joy away from me.'

Kanye also admits that before he and Kim got together, he would dream about the reality star.

But
he tells Kris that he is not about to do a Tom Cruise and jump up and 
down on her couch, much to the 
despair of the Kardashian/Jenner matriarch.

'I just dreamed about being next to her. I keep saying it... I don't want to start jumping up and down on the couch or anything...' he says, to which Kris excitedly responds: 'Oh please! That would be so fabulous!'

During his appearance on the chat show, Kanye also gives KimYe fans what they have all been waiting for - the first proper look at baby North West.

Rather than in a big money deal with a magazine, the moment comes on Friday's show.

On the prerecorded episode of the show, set to be broadcast on Friday, proud father Kanye shares the photo with the audience.

According to an actress who was in the audience, the baby has mother Kim Kardashian's 'big almond shaped eyes,' but looks like Kanye.

'Just left the @KrisJennerShow and @kanyewest was there today! He was so open and blessed us with baby North's photo!' tweeted Janiela P.

She then responded to a deluge of questions with more information on the baby.

'She looks like kanye she has his cheeks and she is almost as dark as him and she has big eyes like Kim... toocute,' she wrote.

'The baby looks like Kanye with Kim's eyes,' she told another tweeter, adding that North had 'straight short and black' hair.
