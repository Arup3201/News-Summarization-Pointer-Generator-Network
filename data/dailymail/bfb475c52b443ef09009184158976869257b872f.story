Three company bosses swindled thousands of music lovers out of tickets in a £3million scam, a court heard.

Andrew Lagan, 49, David Rolls, 48, and Gary Agar, 44, allegedly ripped off fans of acts including Kings of Leon, Jay-Z and Sir Paul McCartney.

The trio offered non-existent tickets for sale over the internet and processed the payments through the account for their company, Good Time Entertainment (GTE), Harrow Crown Court heard.

Other events targeted included the T in the Park festival in Balado, Kinnross-shire, Scotland, the V Festivals, in Staffordshire and Essex, and the Benicassim festival in Spain.

After payments were made to the Allied Irish bank account, the money was either siphoned off into accounts in Budapest or Thailand, or withdrawn in cash, jurors were told.

Prosecutor Toby Fitzgerald said: 'Together the defendants operated Good Time Entertainment Ltd and through the use of this company and websites associated with it, the defendants offered tickets for sale to members of the public over the internet.

'They created 100 per cent profit for themselves because they took the money without providing anything in return.

'Having had the money transferred into a bank account controlled by the defendants the money was removed from the bank account.

'It was removed to make very sure that when the inevitable time of reckoning came, when it became clear that the tickets were not provided and people were after their money back, the money had disappeared,' he added.

He said transfers were made to the Link FX money exchange in Victoria where more than £2m was withdrawn during the course of a year.

GTE was first set up in June 2003 with Agar the sole shareholder, the court heard.

By 2006 the company's profits were dwindling and Agar formally resigned as its director.

The prosecutor said Rolls and Lagan became involved in the business and the offences were committed between November 2009 and October 2010.

Jurors heard in the autumn of 2009 Agar informed the company's accountant that it had effectively ceased trading, but was going to continue processing credit cards for a company in Budapest.

'There was no trade involved, it was simply a deception of members of the public,' said Mr Fitzgerald.

He explained that when customers did not receive their tickets, they contacted their credit or debit card issuers, who in turn contacted First Data International (FDI), who handled the purchases.

Jurors heard that First Data International had provided GTE with a 'merchant terminal' through which they would take payment for the bogus tickets.

After receiving a large number of requests from banks for reimbursement for 'charge backs' that they had had to pay, FDI stopped transferring money from customers into the company account.

The combined loss to customers who paid by debit card and First Data International was said to be in excess of £2.9m.

Rolls, of Poplar, east London, Lagan, of North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, and Agar, of South Ruislip, west London, each deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of converting or transferring criminal property.

The trial continues.
