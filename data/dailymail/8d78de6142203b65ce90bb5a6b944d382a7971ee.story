A new ice cream that promises to get your taste buds tingling and spice up not only your palate, but also your love life, has been created.

The new carrot and cardamom flavour ice cream is pumped full of aphrodisiac ingredients, which is well-known for its ability to increase sexual desire.

Award-winning ice cream producer Yummy Yorkshire has joined forces with food producer Puckett’s Pickles to create the sweet treat, which combines swirls of both eastern and western flavours for a taste of 'pure seduction', promise the makers.

The key ingredient is aromatic spice cardamom, which is deemed to be a powerful aphrodisiac in certain cultures, as well as having a number of health benefits.

Sarah Puckett, founder of Puckett’s Pickles, said: 'It was great fun working with Yummy Yorkshire and seeing my chutneys being made into ice cream. Who would have thought you could combine the two!

'And my goodness, the resulting ice cream tastes so delicious. If you take into consideration the additional health benefits of cardamom in treating things like respiratory allergies, digestive problems and even depression, it surely makes it one of Yummy Yorkshire’s most medicinal flavours ever.

'There’s no need to feel guilty indulging in this one'.
