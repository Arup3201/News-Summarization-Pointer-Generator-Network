The mothers of two little girls both suffering incurable diseases became acquainted in an unusual way - and found their daughters' lives, like their names, were startlingly similar.

Amber Greenawalt is mother to five-year-old Savannah who suffers mitochondrial disease, and Lindsay Cairns Lennox is the mother of five-year-old Seattle, who has transverse mylitis.

Friends of the two, realizing that Savannah is in desperate need of an oxygen tank and Seattle needs a new wheelchair, created a Go Fund Me page for the little girls to raise money for their medical care.

The pair met after Greenawalt, a die-hard Battlestar Galactica fan, met actress Leah Cairns at a 'Galacticon' conference in Houston.

They began talking and realized they had much in common as mothers of three children. Leah Cairns mentioned her sister, Lindsay Cairns Lennox and her daughter Seattle.

'I never could have imagined how blessed I would be to have Leah come into my life and how impactful that connection would turn out to be,' writes Greenawalt on her blog Life, Love & Laundry.

'While the diagnoses are different the life experiences of our girls have been remarkably similar. In fact the parallels in their stories are incredible and it's easy to see that the wee warriors are kindred spirits right down to their city names.'

Seattle's condition, transverse mylitis, is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation across both sides of one level, or segment, of the spinal cord. After initially being paralyzed by the condition as a 15-month-old, Seattle has mad a good recovery but can't walk for long periods of time and experiences constant pain due to transverse mylitis.

Savannah has Complex I and Complex III mitochondrial disease. She was diagnosed three weeks after her first birthday.

Her mother writes that the condition has 'caused her body to experience poor growth, hypermobility (Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome Type 3), hypotonia, Eosinophilic Colitis and other gastrointestinal issues, hypoglycemia, asthma, immunodeficiency, chronic infections, seizures, dysautonomia, polydipsia/polyuria, dysphagia, reflux, vasso-constriction/dilation and lactic acidosis among other things.'

Fighter: Seattle walks as much as she can but she needs a new wheelchair to help her get around

This currently incurable cellular energy disorder keeps Savannah’s body from being able to convert food and oxygen into energy. This causes cell damage, and eventually cell death.

There is no cure for the disease and many sufferers do not make it to their teenage years. 

Both little girls have spent much of their short lives in hospitals, hooked up to machines and in pain.

'If
they survived at all, it was doubtful they would ever be able to talk, 
walk or function on their own,' reads the Go Fund Me page.

The little fighters have both proved that they're made of stronger stuff. Seattle walks and Savannah's progress has been nothing less than remarkable.

But there's still a long way to go for both of them.

'Leah [Cairn] and another incredible 
woman who came into our life because of her, Lacey Harrison, and two 
other gals Tammy Sheperd and Jo Sharples set up a Go Fund Me page for 
Savannah and Seattle,' writes Amber Greenawalt.

'We have done many fundraisers through the years to benefit some amazing organizations doing research for a cure but we have never fundraised directly for Savannah's medical needs. As I'm sure Lindsay would agree its a tough thing to do....Ask people for direct support. But the truth is our girls have medical needs right now that surpass what we can cover out of pocket on our own. That's why this page, this campaign, means the world to us.'The money will be split 50/50 between Savannah and Seattle. So far, the campaign has raised $4,250.
