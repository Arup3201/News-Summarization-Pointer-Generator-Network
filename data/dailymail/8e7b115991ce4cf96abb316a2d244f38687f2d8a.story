A new group of women dubbed the SITCOMs (single in twenties, clinging on to memories) is becoming the fastest growing group looking for love online.

They might be beautiful, have successful careers and seem like the perfect catch for any man - but they go quickly from one relationship to the next in the elusive search for The One.

And the reason they can’t find the perfect partner is because they just cannot get over the big love of their lives.

The new generation of women, known as SITCOMs, are looking for love online in a quest to find 'The One'

The SITCOM tag is particularly pertinent because, observers say, these women's love lives resemble those that make up the meat of a television situation comedy.

A new survey asked female and male members of a dating site the reasons why they haven’t found the right partner. The most popular answer was that the people they meet online do not match up to a previous lover.

A total of 41 per cent of women and 39 percent of men polled said they still had feelings for an ex-lover and this made it difficult to commit to a new partner.

Other commitments were cited as reasons love had not blossomed, with 24 per cent of women polled saying they were too busy at work, and a further 29 per cent saying they didn’t like meeting new people in bars and clubs.

Sadly for almost a third or men and women a big reason for not finding new love was not having enough friends to help them mix with new people.

Nikki Howarth, 26, is typical of the new generation of SITCOMs.

Both Cheryl Cole and Lauren Goodger have spoken out about how they will always love their first partners

She’s blonde, glamorous and earns £300,000 a year running her own party planning business, Eloquent Events, in Nottingham.

Yet she has been dating online for a year on MissTravel.com and its sister site SeekingArrangement.com.

She said: 'I was in a very serious relationship for a long time before I started dating online.

'It ended badly - he was cheating on me with another woman - but the truth is that I have not properly got over him.

'Every time I date a new man, I do compare them with my ex - both in the way they look and how we connect emotionally.

'I
am always looking for the same electricity that I shared with my ex and
I do tend to end relationships if they don’t live up to the one I had 
before.

'Why settle for second best? I guess I am a classic SITCOM.

'All my girlfriends are the same - we all look back on past lovers and try to find someone who will match them.

'It is not the healthiest way to find love - but we just can’t help it.'

Ex-Towie star Lauren Goodger, 25, split from the love of her life Mark Wright last year after a decade-long romance.

Since then she has never been able to settle down with another man - most recently parting acrimoniously with her former TOWIE co-star Tom Pearce, 21.

She said after calling off her engagement to Wright last year: 'I’ll love Mark for the rest of my life and I’ll never forget sharing so much with him.'

Cheryl, 29, spent years trying to find love again following her divorce from England footballer Ashley Cole, though has recently started dating. She said last year: 'I will always love Ashley.'

Chantelle Houghton, 29, is another celebrity SITCOM.

She has struggled to find love since divorcing her husband, pop star Samuel Preston, five years ago after they met and fell in love on Celebrity Big Brother.

Since then she had had two disastrous celebrity relationships - first with the Crimewatch presenter Rav Wilding and more recently with Jordan’s ex Alex Reid.

She has said that she will always love Preston.

MissTravel owner Brandon Wade said he had noticed an increasing number of so-called SITCOMs going online to find love. He said: 'They are beautiful women who have come out of long-term relationships and are struggling to meet anyone who compares to their ex.

'They don’t want to go to pubs and nightclubs so they end up on sites like ours'.

'These girls tend to go on a lot of dates while they are search for The One and are very active on our sites.'
