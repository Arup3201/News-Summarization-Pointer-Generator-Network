David Cameron last night accused Brussels of existing in a ‘parallel universe’ and ‘insulting taxpayers’ last night as EU budget talks collapsed in acrimony.

In the strongest condemnation of EU institutions ever issued by a British prime minister, Mr Cameron reacted with scorn after being accused of ‘blackmailing’ other leaders by demanding spending cuts and defending Britain’s rebate.

Mr Cameron said he was astonished that EU bosses were refusing to cut ‘a single euro’ from their spending plans – as the two-day summit designed to fix the next seven-year budget deal for the EU broke up without agreement.

British officials were also ‘surprised’ EU bosses thought it appropriate to serve leaders with 1992 Chateau  Angelus Grand Cru, a red wine costing £120 a bottle, as they discussed spending plans.But having made it clear he would veto the budget unless ‘tens of billions’ were slashed from it, the Prime Minister won crucial support from Germany’s Angela Merkel.

France, Italy, Spain and other southern economies who do best out of the budget were horrified at the new alliance between the pair, dubbed ‘Merkeron’ or ‘Camerkel’ by angry EU officials.

The Prime Minister deserves great credit for trying to force the spendthrift EU elite to join the real world, in which national budgets are being slashed and household incomes ruthlessly squeezed.

We also applaud Mr Cameron for recruiting Germany as a powerful ally in resisting a budget deal that would have done nothing to slim down the grotesquely bloated Brussels bureaucracy.

A note of caution, however: the arrogant, self-serving, and unaccountable EU elite rarely takes No for an answer.

The PM will need to be every bit as determined when they come calling with an updated but doubtless equally ludicrous list of budget demands early next year.

The two-day summit was deadlocked by a split between northern countries who put more into the EU budget than they get out, including Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden – and those who are net recipients, such as Spain and Italy.

French president Francois Hollande, who opposed any cuts in the Common Agricultural Policy of farm subsidies, which hugely benefits his country, insisted he would not agree to any cut in the EU budget.

As he left Brussels last night, Mr Cameron said those countries who, like Britain, ‘write the cheques’ were entitled to block the deal being put forward by European Council president Herman Van Rompuy.

‘We’re not going to be tough on budgets at home just to come here and sign up to big increases in European spending,’ the Prime Minister said.

‘We need to cut unaffordable spending – that’s what’s happening at home, that’s what needs to happen here.’

Setting out a range of areas where the budget could be slashed in a way that ‘would not result in hardship for any member states’, he suggested a cut in the EU’s justice and security budget, and was scathing about the European Commission’s refusal to countenance any reduction in the pay and perks of 40,000 Eurocrats.

He said the EU’s administration budget of 56billion euros should be cut by ten billion, but EU bosses instead wanted to increase it to 63billion euros.

The Prime Minister said 200 EU officials were paid more than him, adding that Britain has had to cut administration budgets in Whitehall departments by a third. ‘Brussels continues to exist as if it is in a parallel universe,’ he said.

Chateau Angelus Premier Grand Cru is a red Bordeaux blend loved by wine connoisseurs – and even the less outstanding 1992 vintage which EU leaders were served still costs £120 a bottle.

The wine was given a valuable boost when it was drunk by Daniel Craig’s James Bond in the film Casino Royale.

The 1992 vintage is considered one of its ‘least successful’ years but, according to one reviewer, was still ‘eminently drinkable’. Experts recommended the 1992 should have been drunk at least four years ago.

In the film, James Bond drank the 1982 vintage which costs at least £220 a bottle.

As one-to-one negotiations between individual EU leaders and European Council president Herman van Rompuy dragged on for hours longer than scheduled on Thursday, Mr Cameron got so fed up that he sloped off for lunch at a nearby Belgian brasserie and dinner at a fish restaurant.

‘EU institutions simply have to adjust to the real world. Last night the Commission didn’t offer a single euro in savings – not one euro – insulting European taxpayers.

‘Who is there to stand up for the taxpayer? Which institution in Europe is there to say “where is the money going to come from, who is going to pay for this?” He insisted the budget rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, worth £3.2billion last year, remained ‘completely justified’ despite demands by other EU leaders it be scaled back.

He also vowed to continue to defend it in future negotiations, with another budget summit expected in February.

British officials were privately scathing about the refusal of Mr Van Rompuy to offer a better deal, with one saying the president had ‘f***** it up’.

Mr Cameron insisted it was still possible to salvage a deal at a future summit, but again suggested the British people would have to be asked to give ‘fresh consent’ for a renegotiated relationship with Brussels.

European Commission president José Manuel Barroso said: ‘We want of course efficiency gains. By efficiency gains I mean reducing costs that are avoidable but not necessarily cutting the capacity of the European institutions to act. The reality is the EU budget is small, only around 2 per cent of total public expenditure in the EU.’

Hannes Swoboda, president of the Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament, to which Labour MEPs belong, said the summit had been ‘disastrous’ and blamed Mr Cameron.

Mr Cameron’s stance was welcomed by Eurosceptic Tory Bill Cash, who said the Prime Minister ‘has done as much as anyone reasonably could’.
