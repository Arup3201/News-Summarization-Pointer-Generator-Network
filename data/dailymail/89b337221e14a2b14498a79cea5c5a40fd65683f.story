A Maryland woman has delivered a miracle baby after doctors said a rare heart condition she suffers from would prevent her from ever having children.

Shanelle Ragin was born with a single ventricle in her heart, which would prevent the organ from pumping blood properly.

While surgeons corrected her congenital defect when she was just a day old with a procedure called the Fontan operation, she was left with side effects including difficulty breathing and other concerns that require her to take medication for the rest of her life.

And when she unexpectedly became pregnant, doctors warned her that going through with the pregnancy meant risking death.

'It's one thing for half a heart to function for one individual, but now she's growing a baby inside of her as well,' Dr. Anitha John, a congenital heart defect specialist at Children's National Health System, told NBC News about the miracle.

The pregnancy increased the risk that Ragin would suffer heart failure, especially during labor, when stress on the organ is increased, John said.

She spent almost nine months on bed rest, all the while being monitored intensely.

Still, doctors weren't sure the mother and baby would survive.

'Either one of us dying. That was my biggest fear,' Ragin told the network.

But an expert medical team of about a dozen doctors and nurses at MedStar Washington Hospital Center ensured she pulled through, delivering a healthy baby boy called Carter two months ago.

'It was somewhat of a gamble on her part and on our part,' Freiss told NBC.

Little Carter weighed just more than five pounds - and he has a perfect little heart.

'I felt really proud of Shanelle,' Freiss said.

'I think in a way, having a baby, a healthy beautiful baby like Carter, is an affirming part that you are a normal woman.'

A 2013 study published in the Journal of American College of Cardiology looked at pregnancy after the Fontan operation and found 33 percent of pregnancies were complicated by an adverse maternal cardiac event, including heart failure.

This could occur during pregnancy, labor or up to eight months post-delivery.
