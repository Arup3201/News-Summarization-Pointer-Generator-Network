Mauricio Pochettino has claimed that his old club Southampton are the best team in the Premier League at present, as he prepares to face them for the first time since his summer exit.

The now Tottenham manager enjoyed a successful 18 months at St Mary's, where he took the Saints to their highest league finish in the post-1992 Premier League era, and he has claimed that his old side's visit to White Hart Lane will prove a tough test.

'After (Besiktas on Thursday), we have Southampton,' Pochettino said. 'I think it's the best team at the moment. It's a very tough game we have ahead.'

Southampton currently sit second in the Premier League under new manager Ronald Koeman, and have won four of their first six matches this season.

Spurs, on the other hand, have struggled and are without a win since August 24. The north London side started perfectly when they won their first two against West Ham and QPR, but have since lost two and drawn two on their way to eighth place in the Premier League.

Tonight, Spurs face Besiktas in the Europa League looking to build on their 0-0 draw against Partizan Belgrade, before Southampton visit on Sunday.
