A grandmother who put her beloved pooch in kennels while she went on holiday found out two days later her dog had been given away to someone else.

Doris Burrows, 79, claims she gave seven-year-old Snowy, a terrier-Afghan hound cross, to a rescue centre in August while she went away with her sister.

Two days later she phoned the kennel to check her pet was OK - only to be told, 'she's gone'.

Poor pooch: Doris Burrows, left, claims a rescue centre sold her dog to somebody else without her permission

The widow from Druids Heath, Birmingham, was devastated when she was told the news by Bartley Green's Animal House Rescue - the same kennel where she originally bought the dog.

She claims they sold the dog, which she had had since it was a baby, to somebody else without her permission.Â 

Mrs Burrows had wanted somewhere safe for the pet to stay while she went to Wales with her sister, who was visiting from Australia, in August.

But when she called the rescue centre on August 22 to check on Snowy two days after she had left, she was stunned to hear it had been given away.

She claims police have told her it is a civil matter and outside their remit.

Mrs Burrows said: 'When I found out I felt a stabbing feeling in my heart. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

'I'd had Snowy for seven years and she was a brilliant dog. Everyone loved her.

'I spent the whole time in Wales crying. That was the first time I had used the service and I think Snowy was sold to someone, that's what they do there.

'I miss her so much, she used to sit on my knee while I knitted.

'I really don't know what to do without her. I had a dream last night that I walked into an empty house and Snowy was there.'

Lin Reeves, 49, the owner of the rescue centre said Mrs Burrows gave permission for the dog to be re-homed.

Ms Reeves said: 'We have an awful lot of proof in our favour. I don't want to use it, but I will. We have a wonderful reputation and we want to keep it.

'Doris wanted the dog gone permanently. As I was leaving her home, she said "what happens if I change my mind?" I told her if the dog was still in rescue, she could have it back.

'She had the dog from me seven years ago and has never been happy with it. She wants a perfect dog.

'Snowy is a very, very happy little dog.'
