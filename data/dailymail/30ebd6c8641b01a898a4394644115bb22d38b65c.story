Fans of The Archers will remember her as Emma Grundy, the marriage-wrecking wild child who struggled to overcome a life of rural poverty.

But in this £14,500 silk red Christian Dior dress, actress Felicity Jones, left, who was the voice of Emma for ten years, looks the epitome of Hollywood glamour as she prepares to take on her biggest role yet.

Next year, Felicity, 31, stars in The Theory Of Everything, a biopic about physicist Stephen Hawking based on the memoirs of his first wife, Jane Wilde.

Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking alongside Felicity’s Jane.

Hawking met Jane at Cambridge University and they married when he was 18, soon after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.

Despite looking resplendent in the dress for the Tatler shoot, Felicity told the magazine she is more suited to roughing it.‘I’m quite tomboyish and I like being comfortable – but that’s not what the red carpet is about.’

Asked what she did for fun, she seemed momentarily at a loss before answering: ‘Fun? What’s that?’

The Oxford University graduate also revealed that her public persona was a subject that keeps her awake at night.

‘When you’re an actress, you don’t want people to be distracted by who you are, what you’ve been getting up to,’ she said.
