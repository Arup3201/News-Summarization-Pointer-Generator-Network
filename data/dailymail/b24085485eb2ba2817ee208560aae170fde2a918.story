TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has accused Tesco of selling 'dirty tuna', caught in nets that kill rare sharks and turtles.

An investigation has alleged that the store - which three years ago pledged to ban products caught by this method of fishing -  is the first to reintroduce the 'unsustainably caught' tuna.

The celebrity chef investigates the company in his Channel 4 series, Fish Fight: Hugh's Last Stand, which will air tonight.

Tesco has been accused of selling 'dirty tuna' in nets that kill rare sharks and turtles by TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'Tesco made one of the biggest commitments of all to sell the most sustainable tuna. But they now stock a new brand called Oriental and Pacific which is caught using methods that accidentally catch and kill endangered animals like turtles, rays and sharks.

'If they really care about our oceans, then Tesco should take this tuna off the shelves today.'

In 2011, Tesco pledged that its tuna would be caught by pole and line.

However, the documentary claims that soon after, the supermarket giant began to stock the cheaper Oriental and Pacific brand of tuna, caught by nets, and does not 
promise to eliminate 'unsustainably caught' tuna from its supply chain.

Welfare campaigners say that the nets,
 which make up the purse-seining method, capture other ocean creatures -
 such as sharks and turtles - which are then killed.

Greenpeace has compiled a league table of sustainable tuna. Tesco comes last and Sainsbury's comes top.

Greenpeace's
 Ariana Densham accused the supermarket of 'pure hypocrisy', and said it
 was 'rolling back its pledge to protect the oceans'.

A Tesco spokesman said that its own-brand tuna was pole and line caught, and sustainably sourced.

He added: 'We moved much faster than many of our competitors to make sure our own-brand tuna is 100 per cent pole and line.

'We
 have also promised to use sustainable tuna in other products like 
pastas, sandwiches and salads. Many of our competitors continue to sell 
non-pole and line caught tuna. 

'Customers have a great choice of sustainable tuna at Tesco.

'Like other supermarkets, we offer branded tuna products that aren’t yet 100 per cent caught by pole and line. We do this to give customers a broad choice.

'For customers who want sustainably sourced tuna, all our own brand products offer this.'

LDH, brand owner of Oriental and Pacific tuna, said that at least 85 per cent of the tuna they sell is fished using the pole and-line method, but that the skipjack tuna is caught using the purse-seine fishing method.

They added: 'All of our tuna suppliers are members of the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation and support its initiatives for long-term conservation of tuna stocks.'
