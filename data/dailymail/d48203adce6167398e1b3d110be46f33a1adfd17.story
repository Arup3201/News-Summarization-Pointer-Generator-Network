Yellowstone National Park
Rangers revealed Sunday that the little girl who was shot in the 
confines of the park Saturday was just three years old.

Ella Marie Rucker, from Pocatello, Idaho, died on the shore of Yellowstone Lake at the 
Grant Village campground when she was shot with her father's firearm.

Though
authorities refused to say whether the death was an accident, the 
tragedy was first reported when the girl's mother called emergency 
personnel and said the girl had shot herself.

Emergency responders 
were unable to resuscitate the girl after her mother called emergency 
dispatchers according to a statement from park spokesperson Al Nash.

Nash described the tragedy as 'the kind of thing that isn't supposed to happen here.'

A
U.S. law that took effect in 2010 allowed people to carry guns into 
national parks as long as federal, state and local firearms laws were 
met, according to the National Park Service.

The
death comes three years after enactment of a federal law that lifted a 
decades-old ban on the possession of firearms by visitors to most 
national parks, including Yellowstone.

Uncommon: The girl was killed in a more populated section of the park known as Grant Village, which features a ranger station, stores, and other amenities. It is the first gun death in Yellowstone since 1978

It marks the first fatal shooting in 
Yellowstone since 1978, and the first shooting death of a child in the 
park since 1938, when the 13-year-old son of the park's master mechanic 
accidentally shot himself in the head with a rifle, Nash said.

Although
hunting is permitted at a handful of national parks, including Grand 
Teton in Wyoming, hunting or even firing a gun is unlawful in 
Yellowstone, according to park literature.

The
forested campsite where the shooting occurred sits near a developed 
area in the Wyoming section of the park known as Grant Village, which 
features a ranger station, lodge, stores and other amenities.

A
portion of the forested campsite where the shooting occurred remained 
cordoned off on Sunday as Yellowstone rangers and special agents with 
the National Park Service continued their investigation.

The
legislation allowing visitors to carry guns in the parks was tacked on 
to a credit card bill passed by Congress in 2009 and signed into law by 
President Barack Obama.

The
measure was backed by gun-rights proponents like the National Rifle 
Association, but opposed by groups representing park rangers and retired
National Park Service employees.

Supporters
said it would provide uniformity to a patchwork of firearms regulations
that allowed guns in public lands overseen by the U.S. Forest Service 
and federal Bureau of Land Management, but not in national parks and 
wildlife refuges.

Opponents
said the law would heighten risks for visitors and park employees, 
embolden poachers and complicate prosecution of wildlife crimes.

Yellowstone,
which was the first area designated a U.S. national park and is among 
the country's most popular outdoor destinations, spans 2.2 million acres
of pine forests, river valleys, mountain lakes and geysers in parts of 
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, and attracts about 3 million visitors a 
year.
