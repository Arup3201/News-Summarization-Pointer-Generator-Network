We all like to think we would be a hero in a crisis – but research shows that most people would run a mile.

And the meek, sensing injustice, are more likely to respond rather than the brash and self confident.

Tests on students in Germany found they all insisted they would react but only 26 per cent – mostly quieter personalities – did intervene when they saw a mobile phone being ‘stolen’ in a stunted scene six months later.

The report – published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin – concluded: ‘Participants appear to overestimate their moral courage when responding to vignettes.’

Dr Cynthia McVey, of Glasgow Caledonian University, said: ‘The results emphasise a basic Christian tenet that the meek shall inherit the Earth.’

Every student in the test claimed they would intervene, with the strongest reactions coming from those who believe themselves to be strong characters

Academics from Koblenz-Landau University
in Germany gathered together 65 students who sat character assessments 
and then, six months later, were recalled and asked how they would react
if they saw a theft.

The imagined scenario involved the witness sitting in a laboratory waiting for another female student to arrive so a test can start.

A staff member reveals that a mobile phone lying on a nearby table belongs to someone who is returning to retrieve it that evening.

The missing student then arrives and, when the tester leaves the room for a moment, the woman reaches across and pockets the phone.

Every witness claimed they would intervene, with the strongest reactions coming from those who believe themselves to be strong characters, socially confident and unfazed by the status of others.

Researchers then repeated the experiment with 68 different students - though this time they enacted the crime as if for real.

Only 18 people – 26 per cent – intervened and continued to protest, bringing the matter to the attention of the member of staff when he returned to the lab.

Just one personality trait was found to be significant in the heat of the moment: a sensitivity to seeing a third party unfairly disadvantaged.
