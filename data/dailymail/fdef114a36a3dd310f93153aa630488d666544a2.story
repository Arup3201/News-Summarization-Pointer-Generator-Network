'I hit him because he cheated on me,' the 5-foot, 125-pound academic who is an outspoken critic of domestic violence told officers.

Baney - is wrote a book entitled Guide To Interpersonal Communication - was taken into custody without incident.

Retired NYPD sergeant Frey suffered cuts to his left ear and the right side of his neck, reports the Daily News.

The professor was released the next day, but a judge authorized an order of protection for Frey.

At Columbia, Baney is faculty director of the FDNY Officers Management Institute and sits on the faculty of the NYPD's Police Management Institute. 

High flying FDNY and NYPD personnel who are considered to have bright futures within their organizations are selected for the program.

'It's bizarre. Her specialty is about communication and building relationships with the public. In reality she has a hair trigger.' a school source told the Daily News.

Baney maintains her innocence.'We believe when the facts ultimately come to light and are brought out in the court she is going to be vindicated,' said her attorney Stephen Bilkis.

'She's very anxious to have her story heard.'
