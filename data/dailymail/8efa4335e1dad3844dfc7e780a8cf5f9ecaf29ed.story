The president of the Discovery Channel is finally speaking out about their recent special Eaten Alive.

The highly hyped network event was supposed to show Paul Rosalie, a noted naturalist, as he was consumed by a giant Anaconda, something that would be made possible by a special suit he was wearing.

In the end the snake never did eat Rosalie, and now, Discovery president Rich Ross is admitting that the show was misleading.

Sorry: Rich Ross (above), the president of Discovery Channel, is admitting that the network's Eaten Alive stunt, where a snake was supposed to eat a grown man, was 'misleading'

Not fun: The network special was supposed to show naturalist Paul Rosalie being eaten by an anaconda (above) while wearing a speical suit

Speaking at the 2015 TCA, Ross said the show had 'the right intention with a packaging that was misleading.'

Then, according to The Wrap, he said the 'show probably erred on the side of sensationalism.'

He also said there would not be a similar stunt on the network in the future. 

Roslaie and the program came under fire after, in the end, only part of his head was consumed by the giant anaconda for just seconds before he called it off.

What's more, though the show featured a search for the perfect snake, in the end it was discovered that the reptile had been specially flown in for the stunt.

That reptile was also far too small to eat a grown man it was later revealed. 

Cheating: In the end, the snake was called of after getting part of Rosalie's head in its mouth, this after it was flown in as no other snakes were found in the wild

Rosalie has also previously admitted that he too believed the special was misleading, and that it was actually meant to be 'an attempt at entering the belly of the beast not a promised outcome.'

The show and Rosalie were bashed by many on social media, who felt they had been cheated following weeks of promotions that promised to show the naturalist being eaten by a snake.

And while the stunt may have looked uneventful on television, Rosalie later said that the snake was actually constricting him for an hour before he was rescued.
