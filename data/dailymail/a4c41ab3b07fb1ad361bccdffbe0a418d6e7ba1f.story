Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

Now share your opinion

Luis Suarez sensationally appeared to BITE Giorgio Cheillini during Uruguay's decisive 1-0 victory over Italy in their final Group D game at the World Cup.

The striker was given rough treatment by the Italians throughout the game, with defenders Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli scything him down at every opportunity - and even the mild mannered Andrea Pirlo appearing to aim an elbow in his direction.

However, there is no excuse for Suarez's reaction in the 80th minute when he was seemed to sink his teeth into Chiellini's left shoulder during a Uruguay attack - forcing an hysterical reaction from the Italian hardman who pulled down his shirt sleeve and chased the referee to show him the teeth marks.

Cover up! Suarez holds his face to suggest that he had only collided with the Italian defender

Suarez reacted by holding his mouth to suggest he had accidentally collided with the defender and managed to escape a caution as the incident went unseen by the match official.

Uruguay went on to win the game, courtesy of a late goal from Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin, and qualify for the next stage of the tournament - although Suarez's World Cup future could be in the balance, especially after Chiellini confirmed that he had been bitten.

FIFA said that they were awaiting the official match report  and 'gathering all necessary information before making a decision'.

Incredibly, this is the THIRD time that Suarez has been involved in a biting incident with an opponent.

The Liverpool striker received a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013. After that incident he tweeted: 'I'm sad for what happened this afternoon, I apologize Ivanovic and all football world for my inexcusable behaviour. I'm so sorry about it!!'

Those words now seem even more hollow, especially as it was the second time he had failed to learn from his mistakes after previously receiving a seven-game ban for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in November 2010.

Neither is Suarez any stranger to controversy at the World Cup.

It is four years since he was sent off for handling Dominic Adiyah’s goal-bound shot in extra-time against Ghana - ultimately denying the tournament its first ever African semi-finalists.

Suarez was only banned for one game and commented afterwards in reference to Diego Maradona's goal against England in 1986, 'Mine is the real 'Hand Of God'. I made the save of the tournament.'

Whether he escapes with such lenient treatment this time remains to be seen.
