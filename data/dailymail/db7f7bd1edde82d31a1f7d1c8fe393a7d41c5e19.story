A mother-of-two developed life-threatening brain tumours - just weeks after her husband died from the same illness.

Nicola Mansfield was devastated when just two weeks after their honeymoon, her husband John collapsed and was diagnosed with a brain tumour that developed into brain cancer.

With her husband not expected to survive the year, she became pregnant and was able to tell him the news two days before he died at 35.

But shortly after the tragedy, and expecting twins, she too discovered she had developed potentially deadly brain tumours.

The couple, from Darlington in County Durham, were told in January 2012 that Mr Mansfield was terminally ill.

They enjoyed one last holiday together and after a weekend in the Lake District, Nicola decided to make her husband’s final wish come true.

She said: 'We came back from our holiday talking about baby names and I knew I had to make his dream come true so I asked him how he’d feel if I tried to get pregnant before he died.

'His biggest dream was to be a father and he was so happy he burst into tears.

'We knew our chances were limited after chemotherapy so we had John’s sperm frozen and, knowing we were living on borrowed time, had two eggs implanted to try and make sure one took.

'The process was really difficult on top of everything else but it was something John really wanted and I wanted to do it for him.'

Knowing Mr Mansfield didn’t have long left, his Macmillan nurses arranged an early scan for his wife.

However, he lost consciousness the night before his wife found out she was carrying twins.

Mrs Mansfield said: 'The nurses said he could hear me so as soon as I came home, I told him - he grunted and that was his way of telling me he knew.

'I think that’s what he was hanging on for as he passed away two days later while I was sat by his bed - I held his hand as he took his last breath, it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.'

It was only following Mr Mansfield’s death that she discovered she too had brain tumours.

The same team that nursed her husband went on to care for her, operating when she was 23 weeks pregnant.

Mrs Mansfield, who suffered hearing loss and headaches throughout John’s illness, said: 'The babies were too little to save and I knew there was a chance I could come out without them but that morning I felt calm, as though John was with me and I felt everything would be alright.'

She credits the support of friends, family, district and Macmillan nurses with getting her through the hardest time of her life but says without twins Archie John and Ella Kate, she wouldn’t be here to tell her story.

'I didn’t want to continue living without John, it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do and without the twins, I would have given up,' she said.

'I wake up every morning wishing he was here but my babies are the reason I carry on.

'They’re his legacy and they’re amazing - they know who their daddy is and they blow kisses to his picture every night.'

The twins are now 15-months-old and their mother is still undergoing treatment for a tumour, facial paralysis and hearing loss.

Mrs Mansfield is now fundraising for Macmillan Cancer Care and lending support to other people suffering from cancer.

She said: 'Don’t give up, no matter how hard life gets something good will happen - I’ve got my babies to prove it.'

When Nicola and John Mansfield met, they knew within seconds that they would end up married.

'It was a whirlwind romance, we clicked from the moment we met,' she said.

'We knew we’d get married and it was a real love story, just like in the films - only ours had a tragic ending.'
