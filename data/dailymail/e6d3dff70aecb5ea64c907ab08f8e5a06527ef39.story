George Ford did his England chances no harm by out-kicking and out-thinking rival fly-half Danny Cipriani in front of watching national coaches Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell.

The 21-year-old orchestrated Bath’s narrow win thanks to some excellent place kicking and a late second-half break which split the Sale defence.

His dash from the Sale 22 paved the way for a match-winning try from Bath’s speedy wing Semesa Rokoduguni.

Ford then completed a haul of 19 points by adding the conversion and landing a second long-distance penalty to deny resilient Sale a losing bonus point.

Bath assistant coach Toby Booth revealed afterwards that Ford, who missed out on the summer tour to New Zealand because of a shoulder operation, had cut down on his kicking practice in an effort to stop fatigue. ‘It’s quality not quantity,’ Booth explained.

His coaches believe Ford has overdone his training, which caught up at the end of last season when he missed crucial kicks in his team’s failed push for silverware. Booth said Ford’s performance against Sale was going to be closely monitored, because he had played little in pre-season.

‘Everyone was looking to see how he had gone,’ Booth said before talking about how Bath assistant coach Darren Edwards was working with Ford on his place kicking.

‘They are going down the more quality rather than quantity route. George felt that maybe he was overtraining.

‘Perhaps not at the start of the season, but later maybe the fatigue creeps in. The rewards were very good today.’

Ford’s England rival Cipriani had a quiet afternoon and failed to ignite Sale’s backline.

Cipriani, who was replaced following Rokoduguni’s try for Ford’s older brother Joe, kicked all his goals in contributing 10 points but failed to match the dash of his Bath rival.

His afternoon included surviving a late challenge from lock Dominic Day in the 26th minute. Day was sin-binned and Cipriani recovered to kick the penalty which put Sale back into the match after a disastrous start.

Bath must have thought they were going to win easily when Anthony Watson outjumped new Sale full-back Luke McLean. The catch gave the wing an unexpected opening to the try line 40 metres away.

With Ford converting and then adding a penalty, Bath were well set in a match which became scrappy. Sale’s tenacity proved a big factor and a try by livewire centre Mark Jennings helped to cut the half-time deficit to only 16-13.

Ford struck early in the second half from halfway to extend Bath’s lead only for Sale to gain the advantage at 20-19 through Mark Easter’s try. 

However, Bath finished the stronger and Ford supplied the touch of class to burst clear in the 72nd minute. He then capped a fine display by striking a penalty from near halfway.
