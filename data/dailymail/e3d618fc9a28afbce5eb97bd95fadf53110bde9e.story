This terrifying dashcam footage captured the moment that a doctor rushing to work caused a 50mph head-on smash.

The 10 second video caught the instant the medic pulled her Toyota Aygo straight out into the path of an on-coming Citroen Picasso. 

The front seat passenger of the Picasso suffered whiplash after driver, Colin Kay, 72, was left unable to avoid the impact. 

The doctor, who has not been named, was airlifted to hospital after being cut free from the twisted metal but fortunately escaped serious injury.

At the start of the short clip Mr Kay's Piccasso can be seen travelling along the road at 50mph.

Just as the vehicle approaches a junction, the white Aygo traveling in the opposite direction turns right directly into his path. 

The accident took place on the A586 Great Eccleston bypass at St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire, in August last year, but details have only just emerged. 

 'It is a miracle that no one was more seriously hurt given that it was a serious head-on smash at 50mph, said Mr Kay

'I had very little time to brake because she turned right in front of me due to a lapse in concentration.

'I feared the worst afterwards because she was trapped in her vehicle but thankfully she was not badly hurt, and was cut out by the Lancashire Fire and Rescue.

'My wife and I were protected by airbags and were okay, too. All the emergency services were brilliant at the scene.'

The medic initially denied liability but was caught out because Mr Kay had captured the whole incident on his SmartWitness dashcam. 

The retired engineer, who has had a clean driving licence for 50 years, bought a Smartwitness dashcam because he wanted to be able to produce evidence in the unfortunate case he was involved in a car crash.

Mr Kay said he did not have time to react and avoid an impact with the white coloured Toyota Aygo

Both cars were written off as a result of the crash, but fortunately no one was seriously injured

'She was rushing to work in the morning when the accident happened,' he said.

'I contacted the police because I was keen to see a full prosecution to stop more careless driving.

'But nothing has been done because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time.

'The only way our roads are going to become safer is when motorists driving carelessly like this are punished.

'My wife and I were very lucky that we were not more seriously hurt and we have very disappointed that no police action has been taken in this case.'

Mark Berry, SmartWitness sales director, said: 'This accident perfectly shows the value of our cameras.

'You have a collision where one driver is very clearly at fault but initially is disputing liability.

'I very much doubt that her insurers would have settled so readily if they had not been presented with the SmartWitness footage. The camera never lies.'

A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: 'Officers attended the scene and carried out a thorough investigation.

'An accident report was submitted with a recommendation for the driver to attend a Drivers' Alertness Course.

'Unfortunately the officer in the case was off sick and the report was not processed within the allocated time frame for prosecution.'
