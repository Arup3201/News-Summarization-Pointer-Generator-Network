Douglas Yim, 33, faces 126 years in prison for shooting and killing his friend

An Oakland man has been found guilty of first-degree murder for shooting and killing his friend during an alcohol-and-cocaine-fueled argument over the existence of God.

Douglas Yim, 33, now faces 126 years in prison for the crimes. He was also found guilty Tuesday of assault with a firearm for shooting a second friend in his living room during the violent argument two years ago.

Yim killed 25-year-old Dzuy Duhn Phan after a night of drinking, doing drugs and playing video games. Another friend, Paul Park, testified during the trial that the two men had engaged in a heated discussion about God when Yim turned violent.

Phan was allegedly prodding Yim about
 his belief in God, asking him where God was whenever Yim lost a video 
game, according to the Oakland Tribune. He also asked where God was when Yim's father had died several years earlier of a stroke.

Yim
 flew into a rage in response to the remark about his father and he 
threw his video game controller into the television, breaking the 
screen.

Phan and Park tried to calm Yim down for the next couple minutes but their attempts failed.

At
 one point, Yim said he should grab his gun and shoot Phan. A short time
 later, he walked into his bedroom, loaded his AR-15 assault rifle and 
returned to the living room, where he began firing the weapon.

This is the home on Henrietta Drive in Oakland, California, where Yim opened fire on two of his friends, killing one of them

Yim shot Phan at least six times, including once in the side of the head. Park was shot in the finger as he threw his hands up in defense.

Yim's attorney, Mario Andrews, argued for a lesser charge of manslaughter, saying that Yim feared for his life because Phan had refused to leave his house after their argument about God.

Andrews also argued that the murder could not have been premeditated because Yim was under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. 

But prosecutors said Yim had several minutes to contemplate the murder between the time of the argument and the time the shots were fired, at least according to testimony from Park. 

'The jury got the verdict correct,' Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Allyson Donovan said, according to the Oakland Tribune. 'This gives justice to Mr. Phan and his family.'
