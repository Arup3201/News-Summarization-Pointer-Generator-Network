An eight-year-old boy was killed yesterday after being run over by a 4x4 towing a trailer at his family's farm.

Charles Kimm was playing in the grounds of the farm, Wyndales Lodge in Symington, south Lanarkshire, when he was struck by the vehicle as it reversed through a gate.

His father, Robert, 56, is believed to have been driving the vehicle at the time.

Despite the efforts of paramedics who rushed to Charles' aid by helicopter, the schoolboy was declared dead at the scene.

Charles lived at the farm with his 
parents Robert and Suzanne, and his two sisters, who were yesterday 
being comforted by family members.

Mr Kimm, keeps horses and chickens on
the farm and is a breeder of English pointer dogs. He also runs till 
suppliers Strathclyde Cash Registers, which is used by a number of local
businesses, from his home.

Several police officers attended at the farm following the incident just before 3pm on Thursday but it is being treated as a tragic accident.

Today Charles' parents were too upset to comment but a family spokesman said they had been left 'devastated' by what had happened.

They also released a photograph of him posing proudly next to his mini motorbike.

Children's toys lay abandoned in the front garden of the home while blinds and curtains remained drawn. Several vehicles could also be seen parked outside the property.

Shocked neighbours described the tragic schoolboy as being 'lovely' and 'care-free'.

Tom Robertson, 76, who stays next door to the Kimms, said: 'It's quite a hard thing for me to talk about, it's awful.

'I heard about what happened yesterday afternoon and it's a total tragedy. I know them as neighbours and they were very nice neighbours. The family are just your average, happy normal family.'

Mr Robertson added: 'The boy would go out and feed the horses, he was just a lovely wee boy.

'I hope that God is with them over the coming days because I'm sure they are going to need him.'

Kim Adam, 54, who runs Feufield animal sanctuary near the farm, added: 'I was outside and I heard the helicopter coming in and landing in the next field.

'At first I didn't think anything of it as Army Chinooks fly over here all the time, but when it came down I realised something was wrong.

'When I found out that he had died I was shocked, it is absolutely tragic. I have seen the little boy out in the garden, I can't imagine what the family must be going through.'

A full investigation into the accident is to be carried out by the Health and Safety Executive.

A Strathclyde Police spokeswoman said: 'It appears the car was reversing through a gate when the young boy was struck by the vehicle.

'The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

'An inquiry is underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death.'
