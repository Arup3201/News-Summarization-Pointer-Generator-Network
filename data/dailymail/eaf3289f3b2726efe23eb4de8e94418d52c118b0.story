Flash-fest: Parents give presents worth thousands of pounds as parents try to curry favour with the school

It sounds like a lottery winner’s wishlist – vintage wine, diamond necklaces and flights on a private jet.

But these luxuries are in fact being enjoyed by teachers, thanks to an ‘aggressive and manipulative’ gift culture among parents at private schools.

Families who believe they can curry favour with staff are showering them with £1,000 handbags and Savile Row suits as well as thousands of pounds in vouchers.

Teachers are also being given cases of vintage wine and designer goods from Chanel, Prada, Mulberry and Tiffany as part of a ‘cut-throat flash-fest’.

At one school teachers were reportedly offered the use of a family’s private jet.

Tatler magazine said it had received ‘extensive first-hand accounts’ from readers that ‘some schools are accepting inappropriately extravagant gifts’ from parents.

It has questioned whether a Hermes handbag or a diamond necklace should be considered as an acceptable end-of-term present or ‘simply bribery’.

And it points out that such gifts could see a school fall foul of the Bribery Act 2010.

Tatler has now launched a campaign, urging families to put pressure on their children’s private schools to clamp down on competitive gift giving, which is getting increasingly out of hand.

An investigation found that some families viewed lavish presents as ‘just another way to get ahead’.

Some even arrive at parents’ evenings with ‘bottles of champagne and trays of cupcakes’.

The publication has contacted the heads 
of all schools in the Tatler Schools Guide, requesting their policy on 
presents and plans to publish responses on its website today.

Lavish: Teachers have been given diamond necklaces and private jet rides as an end-of-term gift from parents

And it has urged parents to take a stand against those that ‘consider extravagant gifting an acceptable practice’.

A report in the magazine’s June edition, entitled Classroom Corruption?, highlights how a £1,000 handbag is now considered an ‘acceptable token of thanks’ for teachers at some private schools.

Chanel handbags, Savile Row suits, iPads, keys to the family villa and use of the family jet were among presents reported to Tatler.

And the report warns that the trend shows no signs of abating.

One headmaster of a prep school said he returns gifts once a fortnight on average.

‘It’s all year round: theatre tickets, hampers, silk ties, handkerchiefs, even gold cufflinks pinpricked with diamonds,’ he said.

One mother said she was ‘miraculously’ 
offered a place at a full prep school with a large waiting list after 
giving the headmistress of her child’s nursery a holiday for Christmas.

A mother at an all-girls London prep was told that if she contributed less than £90 to the class festive gifts, another parent would ‘feel uncomfortable’ about signing the same Christmas card.

‘Needless to say, I had far less to give, but I was stung and humiliated into opening my wallet and forking out more than I would spend on a single member of my own family,’ she said.

Teachers described feeling embarrassed by the lavish gestures, with some selling presents on eBay or giving them away as presents.

Janette Wallis, of The Good Schools Guide, said that parents often feel ‘exceptional gratitude’ to teaching staff.

Kate Reardon, editor of Tatler, yesterday appealed to parents and schools to take a stand.

She said: ‘The charming tradition of giving your teacher a leaving card or gift, possibly something homemade, is one we’ve all grown up with.

‘But we have heard from worried parents and schools that in some cases the gifting culture is becoming increasingly aggressive and manipulative.’

Some schools have clamped down – Notting Hill prep in West London imposes a £40 cap on staff presents over the year and Stowe introduced a gift register and a cupboard for anything exceeding £50. Rugby and Harrow also guard against ‘overzealous gifters’.
