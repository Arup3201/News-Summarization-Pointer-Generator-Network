Both Cape Verde and Zambia were eliminated from the Africa Cup of Nations on Monday after they played out a goalless draw in treacherous conditions at Estadio de Ebibeyin.

Cape Verde finished with three points and with the same goal difference as the Democratic Republic of Congo, who drew 1-1 with Tunisia in Bata at the same time, but scored one goal less and were therefore eliminated by the slimmest of margins.

DR Congo go through with group winners Tunisia.

Zambia, who were the 2012 winners, finished last in Group B with only two points.

The match was played in a tropical downpour that made the game unplayable at times as giant puddles stopped the flow of the ball and risked injury to the players.

The teams were forced to keep the ball off the ground for much of the second half as the deluge fell increasingly harder but then suddenly abated with some 20 minutes left.

Both sides had few occasions to win the game, not even towards the end when they both sacrificed defenders to throw more players into attack.

Garry Rodrigues, making his first start at the tournament for Cape Verde, went narrowly wide with two efforts in the first half while Zambia's Evans Kangwa botched a shot from close in 12 minutes from the end.

There was also a half chance in stoppage time for Mukuka Mulenga of Zambia but he, too, was off target.

'I'm very sad and disappointed with the result but not with my players. They did all they could,' a tearful Cape Verde coach Rui Aguas told reporters. 'We missed a lot of chances in three games but we gave 100 percent, we gave our all.'
