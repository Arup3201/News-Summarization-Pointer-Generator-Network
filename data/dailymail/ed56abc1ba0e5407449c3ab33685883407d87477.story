Australian holidaymakers have been warned to check the fine print on their travel insurance policies after a Perth woman was left to pay $135,000 for surgeries when she was shot in the face in the US.

Amy Matthews was enjoying a night out on the famous bar and nightclub strip Bourbon Street in New Orleans when she was caught up in a shooting incident that left one dead and eight others injured.

The 21-year-old university graduate from Mount Hawthorn in Perth is desperately trying to raise $135,000 to pay for a number of facial reconstruction surgeries and a new set of teeth, because her travel insurance does not cover the procedures.

Ms Matthews told Daily Mail Australia her insurance policy for medical emergencies covered the cost of getting her 'fit to fly', but did not extend to the cosmetic and dental surgeries she requires.

Justine Davies, spokeswoman for financial research company Canstar, said this was a little-known condition of 'unlimited medical cover' for travel insurance policies sold in Australia.

'Something that many travellers might be surprised about is that travel insurance is generally for emergency care only, such as accident or pain-relieving procedures,' Ms Davies said.

'The standard cover is basically to get you into a condition of health where you can either fly home or you're patched up to a certain extent.

'But of course there's a lot of medical treatment that is optional such as, for example, extensive dental work, or plastic surgery if you've suffered some sort of disfigurement.'

Michelle Hutchison, Money Expert at comparison website finder.com.au said if a policy says it has 'unlimited' cover there can still be a catch.

'Some exclude unlimited medical cover for medical evacuations, funeral services, pregnancy, if you have been hospitalised or even been to a dentist before your trip,' Ms Hutchison said.

'Some also state that there is no ongoing cover if an appointed doctor deems that you're capable of returning home. Others also state that they won't cover your return flight home if you don't have a return ticket.'

Ms Matthews was one of 10 people who were shot in the early hours of June 29. A 21-year-old US woman, Brittany Thomas, was killed.

She was shot in the right cheek and the bullet exited from her upper lip.

Ms Matthews lost all but 10 of her teeth, had to have her dead gums removed, her tongue stitched up and a metal plate inserted to support her shattered jaw.

Ms Matthews said that if the bullet had hit her four centimetres higher or lower she likely would have died

She said that if the bullet had hit her four centimetres higher or lower she likely would have died.

The 21-year-old was enjoying a night out on Bourbon Street when she heard a gunshot, then another, and then she saw people screaming and running so she started running too.

After making it to the next street she stopped to take shelter when she noticed her face felt like it was on fire.

'We were in the main bars and clubs area and it was packed,' Ms Matthews told New Idea.

'I never felt in any danger until I heard those shots.'

Her mouth was filling up with blood and when she opened it a number of her teeth fell out.

Two off-duty soldiers noticed she was severely injured and rushed to help her.

Using their medical training Gunnery Sergeant William McDaniel and a Naval Corpsman named Josh looked after her for half and hour until an ambulance arrived.

'It was only when they started talking about entry and exit wounds I realised I'd been shot,' Ms Matthews said.

'It was pretty scary but I think I was in too much shock to scream.'

Video footage of the street fight shows Ms Matthews and her friend walking past a bar on the busy street when gunshots send the crowd of people running.

One of the shooting suspects, Trung Le, is facing manslaughter and second degree murder charges. He has pleaded not guilty.

Last week in court a prosecutor acknowledged Le was not the person who shot and killed Ms Thomas. His attempted murder charge relates to his firing on another unidentified shooter.

Almost three months since the shooting Ms Matthews is desperately trying to raise $135,000 to pay for multiple face reconstruction surgeries and a new set of teeth, because her travel insurance will not cover the procedures.

'It feels so unfair we have to pay for something someone did to me for absolutely no reason,' she told New Idea.

But she has been overwhelmed by support from friends and total strangers since the tragic incident.

A friend set up a Facebook page called Repair Amy's smile to help raise money for Ms Matthews' surgeries, and it has been flooded with get-well-soon wishes from New Orleans locals and others.

'I don't love the way I look but I can deal with it. I won't let this stop me. I'll go travelling again when I'm better,' she said.
