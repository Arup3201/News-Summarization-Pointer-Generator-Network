At Manchester City, Frank Lampard has established a reputation for his impeccable manners and his work-rate on the training ground.

At 36, with three Barclays Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the biggest one of the lot - the Champions League - his appetite for the game is undiminished.

That much was made clear when he was summoned from the substitutes bench by Manuel Pellegrini to score Manchester City’s equaliser against his former club Chelsea on Sunday. It was dreamy stuff.

After scoring his first goal for City against former club Chelsea, the Stamford Bridge legend may not have felt like celebrating - but that didn't stop Lampard enjoying an evening out on Sunday night.

Lampard dined at Manchester restaurant San Carlo with fiancee Christine Bleakley and seemed to be in high spirits despite taking two points away from his beloved Chelsea in Sunday's 1-1 draw at the Etihad. 

Before Lampard arrived, City staff knew the stories about his extra shuttle runs after training and his dedication to the game during his career with Chelsea and England.

Even during the World Cup, when Lampard was on the fringes of the team, he would sit down at England’s URCA training when he was waiting his turn in the ball drills and do sit ups.

It was a small thing, a minor detail, but he was the only England player doing it.

That discipline was instilled at a young age, when he chose to ignore the taunts of Martyn Mullen, one of the promising players coming through the youth set up with him at West Ham.

‘Oi, Lampard, what the **** are you doing?’ Mullen shouted across when he saw the young midfielder out on his own after training doing his doggies. It got a laugh from the other players and Lampard has never forgotten it.

To this day, he still does them.

When he is off the training field and away with the team, he spends time plotting the next move in the London property market.

Between him and his dad, Frank Lampard Snr, they own half of the capital, or at least it seems that way. They are family who have always planned for the future.

Lampard could have taken the easy route during his loan spell at City, going through the motions and keeping himself ticking over until he starts his new career with New York City.

Instead he has even surprised City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini with his exceptional attitude and commitment to the game.

At the World Cup, even though he knew he was no longer a first-choice midfield player, Lampard took on extra responsibilities.

He was a comfort blanket for many of the players, an emotional crutch for the youngsters in Roy Hodgson’s England squad.

When he spoke with the media, he held the room so well - particularly once when he sat with Raheem Sterling - that he sounded like the manager.

One day he should be. He has all the requirements.

Lampard is a smart guy, responding in Latin to a Manchester City official who had also studied the language when they were at school.

Football is Lampard’s first language, though. He wanted to play on Sunday - in any event Premier League rules meant he had to be available - and there was never any doubt that he would give anything other than 100 per cent.

When he steered City’s equaliser beyond Thibaut Courtois, he was respectful and dignified, but that goal meant more than many of the 211 he scored in a Chelsea shirt. It proved to Lampard that he could still live with the game at this level.

‘I don’t speak about former players,’ was Jose Mourinho’s narky response following Lampard’s incredible impact on the game at the Etihad.

It was Mourinho’s decision to let Lampard leave when Cesc Fabregas let it be known that Barcelona were prepared to sell him.

During those fabulous tussles between the pair, when Fabregas was the chirpy upstart in an Arsenal shirt and Lampard was the main man in Chelsea’s midfield, they never got along.

It was obvious, watching Lampard’s body language and demeanour, that he was determined to impose himself in every area of the midfield during those combative and compelling clashes. In all those fights, Fabregas never got the better of the Englishman in the centre of midfield.

Even at 36, Lampard still dedicates more time on the training field than most other players

On Sunday, Lampard still had the upper hand after coming on to score that equaliser when City were down to 10 men.

He is sensible enough to know that this cannot last for ever, that his time as a top class Premier League player will come to an end when he leaves for New York City in January.

When the City option came up - initially he was supposed to play for Sheikh Mansour’s team in Australia - he spoke with his father  about his emotional attachment to Chelsea.

It was pointed out to him that the great Bobby Moore, who was idolised by Frank Snr as a young professional at West Ham, went on to play for Fulham later in his career. He was still, quite rightly, cherished down at the Boleyn.

Lampard - or Super Frank, as he is known at Stamford Bridge - is Chelsea through and through.

Despite his goal on Sunday, they are still his team.
