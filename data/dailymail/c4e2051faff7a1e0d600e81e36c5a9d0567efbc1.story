Accident: Football fan Kevin Hayes, 32, fell from an elevated pedestrian walkway and died at San Francisco's Candlestick Park during the 49ers-Green Bay Packers game

The devastated parents of a 32-year-old football fan who died after slipping off an elevated stadium walkway on Sunday have slammed reports their son was too drunk to walk.

Kevin Hayes fell to his death outside Candlestick Park stadium in San Francisco about 1.30pm, with witnesses claiming the long-time 49ers fan was heavily intoxicated.

But his parents Dennis and Janet Hayes said that, while their son had been tailgating and drank a 'few' beers with his brother Jeffrey and friends, he was not too inebriated to walk.

They said he had walked up the ramp 
with his hand on a rail and was turning onto a staircase where the rail 
was lower when he slipped and fell.

'Kevin put his hand out thinking the rail was going to be there, but he slipped, tried to grab the rail, and went over the side,' Janet Hayes said.

Jeffrey Hayes said he was less than two feet from his brother when the accident suddenly occurred.

Racing down to the sidewalk, he called his parents as rescuers were loading his brother into the ambulance.

His brother already was dead when they arrived at San Francisco General Hospital.

Tragically, Kevin was supposed to be the best man 
at his brother's wedding this weekend, a celebration the family decided 
will occur as planned.

'If he were here, he'd be kicking our 
butts and telling us to stop crying and move on, we've got a wedding to 
celebrate,' Janet Hayes said.

'He'd be overwhelmed by the love and 
support pouring in.'

The family has been 49ers season 
ticket holders since 1946, when the team was part of the American 
Football League.

Kevin and Jeffrey Hayes had been going to games since 
they were babies.

Last Sunday, as always, Kevin was wearing his 49ers 
cap and T-shirt, his parents said.

That he died on the opening day of the US football season added to the tragedy.

'The San Francisco 49ers  would like 
to express our deepest condolences to the family during this difficult 
time,' the home team said in a statement.

The family said they have not heard 
directly from the city, the 49ers, coroner or any agency.

Janet Hayes 
said they have no plans to contact an attorney or pursue litigation.

'I refuse to think about that part right now,' she said. 'That is way too negative and my son would be ashamed of that.'

The Hayes family visited the site yesterday in an attempt to piece together what happened.

Asked to describe their son, his parents said Kevin was 'fun loving, easily pleased, loved simplicity, loved family.'

They said their son found humor in life around him, was content with 
just a couple bucks in his pocket, and thrilled that his brother had 
found love.

He spent as much time as he could walking on the beach at Half Moon Bay and planned to move there eventually.

'He loved the serenity of the ocean,' Dennis Hayes said.

Janet Hayes said the family still passionately supports the 49ers but she was unsure when they would return to Candlestick Park.

'It's going to be hard to go to a game in the near future,' she said.

'We're not ready yet. We have to have some time.'
