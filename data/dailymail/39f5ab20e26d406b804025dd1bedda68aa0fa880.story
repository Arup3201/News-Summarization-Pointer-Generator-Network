A male nurse accused of three murders has appeared in court.

Victorino Chua, 48, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address for the three minute hearing at Manchester Magistrates' Court.

Chua also faces 22 counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, seven charges of attempting to administer poison and one count of causing poison to be administered with intent.

Custody: Victorino Chua is alleged to have murdered three people and also faces 30 other charges

Chua wearing a Gap camouflage hoodie, was dwarfed by the prison officer next to him in the dock.

As the charges are so serious, the case, and any bail application, can only be dealt with at the Crown Court, the defendant was told.

Ben Southam, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Mr Chua faces 34 allegations. I would ask that the case be sent to the Crown Court for a bail and preliminary hearing next week.

‘Mr Chua is not able to apply for bail here given the nature of the allegations.

‘Bail will, in any event, be opposed by the Crown.’

In summer 2011, Rebecca Leighton, a 30-year-old nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport was arrested and charged with the murders.

After six weeks on remand she was released and all charges dropped.

Police then went back to re-examine the evidence and arrested Chua, who emigrated to the UK from the Philippines more than ten years ago, in January 2012.

He then spent more than two years on bail before he was re-arrested earlier this week at his home near Stockport.

The alleged poisoning offences relate to the reported tampering of medical records and the contamination of intravenous medicines at the hospital.

Eight patients who were poisoned by contaminated products later died.

They were Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, William Dickson, 82, Linda McDonagh, 60, John Beeley, 73, Beryl Hope, 70, and Mary Cartwright, 89. The deaths of Miss Arden, Mr Lancaster and Mr Weaver are being treated as murders.

A total of 22 people were believed to have been poisoned when products were contaminated at the hospital in the summer of 2011.

Chua was remanded in custody to appear at Manchester Crown Court next Tuesday.
