Sainsbury's epic Christmas TV advert has been praised for its fresh and honest approach to the festivities.

However, the store chain probably did not expect that it would be so unvarnished that it featured food from a rival.

Sitting on the kitchen counter in one scene are several own-label treats from the Co-op – a Christmas pudding, a lemon torte, and a Christmas cake.

The three-minute 30-second advert screened for the first time during ITV1’s Coronation Street last night.

It marked the start of Sainsbury’s Christmas campaign and is a trailer for Macdonald’s film, made from more than 360 hours of footage submitted by people from across the UK.

Among its ‘stars’ are a young boy 
filmed shouting and leaping around his living room on finding a 
longed-for present under the tree and three siblings videoing a 
Christmas message for their father who is serving in Afghanistan, just 
before he surprises them by walking through the door.

'It gave us a chuckle': A spokesman for the Co-operative said it was ‘delighted’ that its Christmas cake (left) and Truly Irresistible Christmas pudding (right) made it into the Sainsbury’s advert

Macdonald, who directed The Last King Of 
Scotland and Touching The Void, won an Oscar for best documentary in 
2000 for One Day In September, about the murder of 11 Israeli athletes 
at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

A
spokesman for the Co-operative said: ‘It seems that our Truly 
Irresistible Christmas pudding, lemon torte and Christmas cake are so 
good even Sainsbury’s can’t resist advertising them.

‘We’re delighted that our delicious Christmas food products have made it into their ad. It certainly gave us a chuckle when we spotted them.’

A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: ‘This year, we wanted to do something truly groundbreaking and extraordinary that would show our customers that we understand what Christmas means to them.

‘So last year we invited Oscar-winning director Kevin Macdonald to make a film capturing Christmas in Britain.

‘The film was made subject only to one condition: that it should comprise of real footage filmed by real people, in the manner of his acclaimed Life In A Day. We wanted Kevin to have complete creative freedom from the outset.

‘The footage used is authentic as the project could not have worked otherwise. The trailers we’ve launched as part of our Christmas TV campaign are a faithful representation of Kevin’s film.’
