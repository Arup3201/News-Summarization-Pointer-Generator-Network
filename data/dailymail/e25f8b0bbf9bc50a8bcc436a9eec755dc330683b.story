The first confirmed case of a human contracting a brain-eating amoeba though tap water has been revealed in a medical journal.

An unnamed four-year-old boy from Louisiana picked up the deadly Naegleria fowleri while playing on a homemade water slide.

He died two weeks later from a condition that the amoeba triggered called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).

A four-year-old boy's death is the first case of brain-eating amoeba - Naegleria fowleri - in tap water. The organisms trigger an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) whch attacks brain cells. A stock image of the infection, which was studied under a microscope and stained, is shown

Previous victims of the organism have been infected after swimming in warm, freshwater lakes and rivers.

PAM is almost universally fatal and is triggered by water containing the amoeba entering the nose during swimming, according to the study by researchers from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

N. fowleri travels to the brain via the olfactory nerve and passes through a porous bone between the sinuses and the brain, where it breaks down nerve cells.

This causes the brain to swell, causing symptoms including vomiting, delirium and seizures.

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare disease of the central nervous system, caused by a waterborne amoeba - Naegleria fowleri.

The amoeba enters the nose and travels up the olfactory nerve (shown as spidery legs in image)

The microorganism typically lives in warm, stagnant bodies of freshwater.

It enters the central nervous system by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve after water is taken through the nose.

It then migrates through porous bone and into the olfactory bulbs of the brain, where it multiplies by feeding on nerve tissue.

Between three and seven days after infection, people exhibit symptoms such losing their sense of smell and taste, because the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs are eaten.

After this, the infection spreads to the rest of the brain, resulting in headaches, nausea and rigidity of the neck muscles, progressing to vomiting, delirium, seizures, and eventually irreversible coma.

People typically die two weeks after contact with the amoeba due to respiratory failure, when the infection spreads to the brain stem, destroying the nerve cells of the medulla oblongata, which controls the functions of breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.

The unnamed boy was taken to a Louisiana hospital in July 2013, nine days after playing on the slide.

He had a 40°C (104°F) fever, severe headache and bouts of vomiting, as well as staring straight ahead without responding for a few seconds at a time.

At first, doctors thought he may have had meningitis, but a CT scan, spinal tap and other tests failed to identify the infection, which could not be treated with antibiotics.

Five days after being admitted to hospital, the boy suffered seizures before being declared brain dead.

His family made the heart-breaking decision to take him off life support five days later, Newsweek reported.

It was only after testing brain specimens that experts pinpointed the cause of death as being down to the amoeba which triggered PAM.

‘This case is the first reported PAM death associated with culturable N. fowleri in tap water from a US treated drinking water system,’ the study says.

Water samples collected from the home and the water distribution system that provided the tap water for the water slide, were tested and N. fowleri identified in both samples.

Others have died as a result of ingesting N. fowleri in contaminated water after Hurricane Katrina, as well as in other states.

The microorganism is usually harmless and only infects the brain if it journeys through the nasal passages.

The state of Louisiana has ramped up efforts to test water supplies for the amoeba, as well as advising that more chlorine be added during water treating, iKnowledge reported.

And a microbiologist is investigating how the amoeba becomes infectious and why some people seem to be more susceptible to it than others.

The reports was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.
