Bret Easton Ellis has branded Millennials narcissistic, over-sensitive and sheltered in a damning 2,000-word analysis of 'Generation Wuss'.

The writer who notably penned American Psycho sparked a social media outburst when he coined the phrase Generation Wuss to refer to those born after 1989.

Now he has written an essay to defend his description, adding that he feels sorry for young people today.

Damning: Bret Easton Ellis, 50, has written a 2,000-word analysis of 'over-sensitive' young people today

In the Vanity Fair article, he writes: 'When Millennials are criticized...they seem to collapse into a shame spiral and the person criticizing them is automatically labeled a hater, a contrarian, a troll.'

He adds: 'My huge generalities touch on their over-sensitivity, their insistence that they are right despite the overwhelming proof that suggests they are not.'

The 50-year-old also lays into news site BuzzFeed, which announced it will no longer publish any negative reviews.

'If this keeps spreading,' Easton Ellis writes, 'then what’s going to happen to culture?'

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr  are also condemned as factors that have fuelled the generation's sensitivity.

'If there doesn’t seem to be an economic way of elevating yourself,' he writes, 'then the currency of popularity is just the norm now and so this is why you want to have thousands and thousands of people liking you on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumbler (sic) —and you try desperately to be liked.

'The only way to elevate yourself in society is through your brand, your profile, your social media presence.'

But Easton Ellis insists he is in fact sympathetic to members of Generation Wuss growing up in the wake of 9/11, two brutal wars, and an economic crisis - in a 'demeaning sexual atmosphere that places a relentless emphasis on good looks (Tinder being the most prevalent example)'.

Generation Wuss: He says twenty-somethings like those depicted in HBO show Girls cannot take criticism

He adds that he has lived with a Millennial and understands that many of the struggles they are 'over-sensitive' about are very real - and the HBO series Girls strikes the balance between critique and sympathy.

But he says he finds it difficult to maintain sympathy for twenty-somethings 'because Millennials can’t deal with that kind of cold-eye reality'.

He added: 'This is why Generation Wuss only asks right now: please, please, please, only give positive feedback please.'

The author lays the blame on the generation's parents who grew up in a cynical age - yet when it came to building their own families they tried to shroud their children from the harsh realities of life.

He warns young people: 'People won’t like you, that person may not love you back, kids are really cruel, work sucks, it’s hard to be good at something, life is made up of failure and disappointment, you’re not talented, people suffer, people grow old, people die.'

His words come after three years of tweeting, in which the author and screenplay-writer regularly mocked young people for being too sensitive.

One tweet read: 'Typical Generation Wuss comment: "You know, Twitter has really ruined you for me." It's TWITTER. Get a f****** life'.

And after a former fan tweeted, 'I just can't follow Bret Easton Ellis anymore. He's so pretentious that I hate myself for following him', he responded: 'Hey GENERATION WUSS: Grow a dick.'
