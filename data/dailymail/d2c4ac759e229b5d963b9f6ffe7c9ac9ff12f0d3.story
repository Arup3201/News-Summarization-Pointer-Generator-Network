Ipswich Town are close to completing a deal to sign Paddy Kenny on loan from Bolton Wanderers until the end of the season.

The 36-year-old goalkeeper has been told he can leave Bolton this month after failing to make a first-team appearance for The Trotters since joining them last summer.

And Ipswich Manager Mick McCarthy had been keen to sign cover for injured Blues' stopper Dean Gerken who is expected to be sidelined for about a month.

Kenny, who has also played for Leeds, Sheffield United and QPR, will undergo a medical in the next 24 hours ahead of completing his move.

The experienced keeper has seven caps for the Republic of Ireland and was part of the Sheffield United side that won promotion to the Premier League in 2006.
