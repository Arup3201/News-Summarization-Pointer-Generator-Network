A businessman accused of trying to deprive his former wife of a huge payout gave his pole dancer girlfriend £250,000-worth of shares in his company.

Multi-millionaire Christopher Nightingale left his wife for the Moroccan after meeting her in a seedy Soho strip club and getting her pregnant, the Daily Mail has learnt.

He then supported her right to remain in the UK and claimed his ex-wife, Sally, was no longer entitled to the £1.6million promised to her from a share sale – and instead cut it to just £83.

Mrs Nightingale has since taken her husband of 25 years to the High Court in London, claiming he has ‘piles of cash’. Yesterday, the pair reached a confidential out-of-court settlement after five hours of private negotiations. Mr Justice Mostyn told them: ‘I’m pleased that you have settled the case, and I hope that you’re able to move forward with your lives now.’

Mahassine Bojji was introduced to the 55-year-old tycoon after he paid her £500 for a private dance at the Windmill lap-dancing club in London’s West End in 2007.

Mr Nightingale, a former lawyer based in Singapore who has a chateau in France, became besotted with Miss Bojji – known as Kelly – and set her up in a luxury home in west London while still married.

She fell pregnant and gave birth to their son, Faris, now five, in February 2009. Mr Nightingale divorced his wife a year later.

Mrs Nightingale now lives in Grade I listed Appleby Castle, set in 29 acres of grounds in Cumbria, which she received as part of her divorce settlement.

He said: ‘I had effectively lived separately from Sally for a long time, with Sally living in England and myself living in Singapore. I met Kelly in 2007, after my marriage had already broken down.’

In the same year he got divorced Mr Nightingale gave Miss Bojji, who is in her early 30s, 42,318,000 shares in his company Alternative Energy, registered in Singapore, worth around £252,000 at the time.

The High Court heard how the financial aspects of the divorce appeared to have been settled in 2009 but Mrs Nightingale, 54, was still due a sum from the sale of shares in Citadel100, a Dublin computer systems firm her husband helped to found.

In emails last July he told her she would receive more than £1.6million, almost a quarter of the £6.6million sale price for the shares.

But he cut her payout to just £83 after claiming that he received only £330 because the sale had been ‘very hard work’ and more complicated than expected.

In December, the High Court froze his British assets, and in a hearing in January a judge criticised Mr Nightingale for making such vastly different offers. It is not known how much money Mrs Nightingale will receive as a result of yesterday’s settlement.

Mr Nightingale said his ex-wife, whom he has three children with, didn’t appreciate money as she’s ‘never had to work’. And he denied that Miss Bojji was an exotic dancer, saying: ‘Kelly is a bright and intelligent lady and as far as I am aware she has never been a pole dancer.’

He said he had given her shares in his company, saying ‘she is after all the mother of my child’, but said the shares were currently suspended from trading and therefore not worth anything.

He also said his ex-wife was entitled to shares in the company. ‘Sally actually got a settlement worth many millions when we broke up,’ he said.

‘I was generous in order to enable Sally to retain the castle, where I hope she can enjoy a good quality of living. She and the children love it and if we had fought over it she would have had to sell it.’

Mrs Nightingale had previously said that she needed the payout to pay for the upkeep of Appleby Castle. ‘I’m not greedy,’ she said. ‘I’m asset rich but cash poor.’

Mr Nightingale, a qualified lawyer, claimed he did not even have the money to pay his lawyers.
