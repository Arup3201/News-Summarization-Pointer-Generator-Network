The private firm which tests benefits claimants to see if they are fit to work has quit its £500million 
contract after claiming its staff received death threats.

Days after ministers said Atos Healthcare was 'committed' to its contract, the French IT company confirmed it was pulling out early.

It follows mounting criticism about its treatment of sick and disabled people lose benefits, including cutting benefits unfairly and ordering a woman in a coma to attend jobs courses.

The Department for Work and Pensions insisted it had achieved a good deal, with Atos paying to get out of the contract.

It had been due to carry out Work Capability Assessments until August 2015.

Ministers stressed that Atos will not receive any compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of the contract, and had made a "substantial" financial settlement to the DWP.

Claimants undergo a Work Capability Assessment when applying for Employment and Support Allowance, to see how their illness or disability affects their ability to work.

The DWP said last summer it had identified 'significant quality failures' in the written reports produced by Atos following assessments.

An improvement plan was put in place, but the Government said it was now looking for a new provider to replace Atos.

The
 DWP said to ensure a smooth transition, one national provider will be 
appointed early next year to take over the contract. In the longer term 
it is intended to move to multiple providers to increase competition.

Disability minister Mike Penning insisted the government had secured a good deal, with Atos paying to exit the contract early

Mike Penning, Minister for Disabled People, said: 'The previous government appointed Atos as the sole provider for carrying out Work Capability Assessments and since then we have carried out several independent reviews and made significant improvements to the assessment.

'Today we are announcing that we are seeking a new provider to replace Atos, with the view to increasing the number of assessments and reducing waiting times.

'I am pleased to confirm that Atos will not receive a single penny of compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of their contract, quite the contrary, Atos has made a substantial financial settlement to the department.'

Atos has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are 
used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and 
incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended 
for work or put through stressful medical interviews.

One
 third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has 
become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare
 reforms.

But it has warned of the impact of staff who have been threatened for their decisions.

Each month last year they recorded about 160 incidents of the public assaulting or abusing staff, the Financial Times reported.

Protests
 had erupted outside their offices this week, when staff received deaths
 threats in person and on Facebook  and Twitter.

Examples
 on social networking sites include someone calling staff ‘murdering 
scumbags’, adding: ‘We won’t be smiling when we come to hang you 
b******s.’ Another said: ‘Know anyone who works for Atos? Kill them.’

Labour's Kate Green  said: 'People have been badly let down by Atos which is why Labour has repeatedly called on the Government to sack them with immediate effect.

'But changing the contract isn’t enough. It’s time for the Government to reform fundamentally Work Capability Assessments so that disabled people who can work are given support they need to find a job.'

Steve Winyard, RNIB's Head of Campaigns and Policy, said: 'Atos were part of a wider system and process problem.

'It's departure might be welcomed by some but it leaves blind, partially sighted and other disabled people in a very uncertain situation.

'DWP will face lots of questions but it also has an opportunity to re-examine the whole process. Blind and partially sighted people need to know what further delays will now be experienced in seeking an assessment or accessing support to find work. People already face months of delays and RNIB would urge DWP to work quickly to ensure people needing support are not left in limbo.'
