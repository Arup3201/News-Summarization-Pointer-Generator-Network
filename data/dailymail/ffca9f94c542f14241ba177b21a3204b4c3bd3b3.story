A judge in Detroit has lashed out at a 19-year-old gang member - telling him he needed a father to 'beat the hell out of him' and keep him out of trouble.

Wayne County Judge James Callahan made the stunning remark before sentencing Latrez Cummings to six months in jail for his role in the brutal mob-style assault on a motorist in April.

In response to the judge's question, Cummings said his father wasn't around when he was growing up.

Callahan said Cummings needed a dad, 
'someone to discipline you. Someone to beat the hell out of you when you
 made a mistake, as opposed to allowing you or encouraging you to do it 
to somebody else.'

Cummings and four others have pleaded guilty to assaulting Steve Utash, who was in a coma for days after the April attack. The mob pounced on him in Detroit after he got out of his pickup truck to help a 10-year-old who had stepped in front of his vehicle.

The judge's comments preceded a loud, spirited exchange with assistant prosecutor Lisa Lindsay, who said the six-month sentence was too light.

She accused the judge of offering Cummings leniency because he didn't have a father growing up. She pointed out that there are many young black men who were raised without a father but haven't committed crimes. Cummings is black.

'Did I ever use the term "black?"' replied Callahan, who is white.

'It doesn't matter if a person is black, white, yellow or red.'

Cummings was the last defendant to be sentenced in the case. The longest sentence was nearly 6 Â½ years in prison for a man whose punishment was enhanced because of his criminal record.
