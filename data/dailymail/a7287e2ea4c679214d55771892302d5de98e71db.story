You may have a favourite pillow that seems to help you sleep better.

But it could cause acne and trigger allergies if it is more than six months old, one expert claims.

This is because dirt, oil, mites and dead skin can build up in older pillows.

It's enough to give you nightmares: Pillows that are more than six months old harbour dirt, oil, dead skin cells and dust mites, which could cause acne and even trigger allergic reactions,sleep experts claim

A study released in March suggested that millions of Britons are risking illness because they do not replace their pillows and duvet as often as they should.

The poll of nearly 2,200 men and women found that 82 per cent of people do not know how often they should replace their pillows and duvet.

According to the Sleep Council, pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets should be thrown away after five years.

But, a study by Ergoflex UK showed that the average Briton uses a pillow for 3.2 years and a duvet for 7.6 years.

As a result, experts say they are risking neck problems caused by sleeping without enough head and neck support.

They are also at risk of health problems associated with dust mite infestations.

The survey revealed 57 per cent of people only replace their bedding when it feels like it is wearing thin.

Dr Robert Oexman, director of the Sleep to Live Institute in Mebane, North Carolina, told The Huffington Post that people sleeping on old pillows might be pressing their faces against dirt, oil and dead skin cells, which can cause acne.

The research centre works with engineers and scientists to develop better products and improve the quality of sleep for people by helping them pick the right mattresses and pillows.

Dust mites also set up home in pillows and can exacerbate asthma and trigger allergic reactions, according to Dr Mark Neustrom, an allergist & immunologist at Kansas City Allergy and Asthma Associates.

Of the 20 per cent of people who suffer 
from allergies, around two thirds may be allergic to dust mites that 
live in carpets and bedding.

He explained that if dust allergy 
suffererâ€™s reactions are much stronger in the morning and at night, 
their pillow may be to blame, because the protein that triggers 
reactions to the mites is not airborne.

Dr Oexman suggests regularly washing bedding and putting it in a tumble drier as an extra precaution.

He
 also advises looking for a pillow that fills the gap between your head 
and shoulders when you lie down, when it comes to shopping for a new 
one.

People
 who sleep on their stomach or back should pick slimmer pillows, whereas
 side sleepers should opt for a plumper pillow to provide necessary 
support he claims.
