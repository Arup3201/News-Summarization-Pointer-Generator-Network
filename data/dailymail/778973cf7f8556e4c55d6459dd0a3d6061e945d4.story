Arrested: Mycia Burden, 25, was arrested on Sunday as she stood naked outside of a Gentleman's Club 

A Gentleman's club told police that a naked woman arrested outside of the club claiming to be a stripper there 'took her clothing off outside of the venue to get the establishment in trouble' because nude dancing is illegal in Dougherty County.

Mycia Burden, 25, was discovered nude outside Club Parisians at around 1 a.m. on Sunday with her friend Maeletha Robinson. She told police that she and her friend were stripping but were kicked out by management for being rude to customers. Burden claimed that the club would not return her clothing.

Club Parisians is under investigation and its owner Ulysses James has agreed to close the club until 'they come to a clear understanding of local ordinances.'

The law of the county all adult entertainment clubs must have a permit to operate and so do their independent contractors. Nudity is illegal though 'exotic dancing' may be allowed, reports WALB. 

'To my knowledge, total nudity is not allowed,' Lt. Chad Kirkpatrick, 'but we’ll need to have all the facts before any charges are made.'

According to a report, Club Parisians does have a business license to operate as a nightclub, and has an alcohol license.

The Club Parisians Facebook Page displays its logo which is a scantily clad woman holding on to the Eiffel tower as though it were a stripper pole.

Photos on their page display curvaceous women in various states of undress.

Police say that is was Mycia Burden who actually called the police to complain about being kicked out of the club.

'The complaintant, Ms Burden, she is the one who called. She actually called and complained on the club for kicking her out of the club,' said Dougherty County Police Lt. Chad Kirkpatrick.

Disorderly conduct: Police say it was Mycia Burden who called the club to complain about being kicked out but she was yelling profanities so police arrested her for disorderly conduct 

'Once the officers made contact with her, she made a complaint where she had been in there stripping,' he added.

Employees at the club say that Burden merely took off her clothing outside the club to get them in trouble.

'Some of the people who work at the club said that when they placed her outside, out of the business, she had her clothes on and she took them off, and said she was going to try to get the club in trouble,' Kirkpatrick said.

Police say Burden was arrested for disorderly conduct because she would not stop yelling profanities.

She was later released on $1,000 bail. 

The club’s owner Ulysses James was charged with operating a business without a license in July 2014 when officers were called to stop a fight.

The club will not re-open until police complete am investigation of the venue's operations.
