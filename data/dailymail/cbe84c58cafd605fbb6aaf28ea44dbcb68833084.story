2014 has seen another 12 months of tantalising sporting action. From events such as the World Cup to the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup - there has been a plethora of moments that have captivated us all.

Sportsmail have captured these historic moments step-by-step through our own brilliant photography team.

With 18 holes to cover and so many different winning permutations, it can be extremely difficult to be in the right place at the right time during the Ryder Cup to shoot the best image. 

With a fair amount of hard work and a slice of luck, I was on par to manage this again at Gleneagles. The 2014 Ryder Cup was no exception, as Jamie Donaldson and his partner Kathryn embraced after Donaldson secured victory for the European team on the 15th green at Gleneagles, I was right where it mattered with my eagle eyes.

To make sure I was in the right place to get the celebratory image this year, I listened all day to the drama unfold on the radio with a close eye on the scoreboard. When it became apparent that victory could happen with Jamie, I was two holes away on the 17th green.

With little time to spare, I ran as fast as my exhausted legs could take me; with three Nikon camera bodies, a 300mm lens, 80-200mm 24-70mm,16-35mm and a flash unit and secured my position to capture the celebrations.

Donaldson put his approach shot within touching distance of the pin. Keegan Bradley conceded, then the celebrations began.

I made sure that I had my widest lens on my main camera, 16-35mm, because I knew it was going to be a tight squeeze on the green where victory was secured.

Here comes the technical stuff: Shot on a Nikon D3, Lens 16mm, ISO 800, 200sec, F2.8
