Alive: Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, disappeared more than three decades ago

A former Chicago commodities broker 
who disappeared in 1979 and was declared legally dead has been found 
living under a false name and working at a casino in Las Vegas.

Arthur Gerald Jones, a husband and father of three, was reported missing May 11, 1979, and declared dead by an Illinois court in 1986.

FBI agents had investigated his disappearance as suspicious and focused on possible mob connections, but they never solved the missing persons case, according to an affidavit filed earlier this week.

Jones, 72, was arrested Tuesday 
on four felony counts related to identity theft and fraud after 
officials say he renewed his Nevada driver's license in 2008 under his 
assumed name, Joseph Richard Sandelli.

Authorities say before Jones 
disappeared, he paid a friend in Chicago $800 for fake documents and a 
Social Security number belonging to another man.

Jones' lawyer, Stephen Stein, 
said the Nevada attorney general's office is offering his client a plea 
deal that would allow him to plead guilty on one of the charges and face
probation. Jones posted bail on Thursday and has not yet discussed the 
plea deal with Stein.

He is set for an August 23 court hearing.

Hideout: Jones settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book

A criminal complaint filed Monday
in Las Vegas Justice Court paints the picture of a powerful Chicago 
financier tormented by snowballing gambling debts.

Jones told investigators he held a
seat with the Chicago Board of Trade and lived with his wife, Joanne 
Esplin, and three young children in Highland Park, Illinois.

But Jones said he was forced to sell his board seat to pay debts, according to the affidavit.

Esplin said her husband forged 
her name to get a second mortgage on the couple's home and pay personal 
gambling debts, the document alleged. She said she suspected he was 
delivering money or running errands for the Chicago mob.

His marriage troubled and 
finances in shambles, Jones told investigators he decided to leave to 
get a 'fresh start,' the affidavit said.

Esplin and Jones had been married
17 years when he disappeared. According to the affidavit, Esplin told 
investigators the last time she saw her husband - whose gambling once 
led him to bet $30,000 on a basketball game - was May 11, 1979, when he 
left to run an errand. She said he looked very nervous at the time.

Jones never spoke to his family 
or friends again. Presuming he had died, Social Security paid his family
$47,000 in survivor benefits, the document said.

Attempts to contact Esplin were unsuccessful on Friday.

Earlier this month, investigators
from the Social Security Administration contacted Nevada DMV officials. They were investigating Jones for using the Social Security number of a
man named Clifton Goodenough, according to the affidavit.

Investigators say Jones used his 
Joseph Sandelli alias to get a Nevada driver's license when he moved to 
Nevada in 1988, and renewed it in 2008. Authorities say he also lived in
Florida and California after leaving Chicago.

According to investigators, he moved he settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book.

Stein said his client has friends in Las Vegas who 'consider him family' and who sprang to his defence after the arrest.

DMV spokesman Kevin Malone said 
cases like Jones' are turning up more frequently as computer databases 
improve and law enforcement agencies are better able to communicate 
among themselves.

'Technology is catching up,' he said.

The Social Security Administration is continuing its investigation.
