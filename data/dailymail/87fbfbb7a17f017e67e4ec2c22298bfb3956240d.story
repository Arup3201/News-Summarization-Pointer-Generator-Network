Tostee, 28, who also used the forum to deny responsibilty for the tragedy, is reportedly the person behind the bodyspace account 'G T' who writes about having sex with two women on one night and taking home scores of others, who he rates with a mark out of out of ten.

Ms Wright, 26, allegedly met Tostee, 28, on the mobile dating app Tinder, and she was seen on the balcony of the Avalon Apartments last Friday.

Tostee, whose bodybuilding.com profile claims he is six foot three (188cm) tall, weighs 113kg and has 18 per cent body fat, just last month wrote about 'a 21 year old Tinder date' he had 'come over for drinks' who he took 'inside from the balcony' before the girl 'totally freaks out' and 'bolts out the door'.

The 26-year-old woman fell 14 storeys from Avalon Apartments at Wahroonga Place on Friday morning

Mr Tostee, who was questioned by police on Friday and released without charge in relation to Ms Wright's death, posted three times on the forum on Monday despite apparently having switched off his account.

At 10.21am, he wrote, 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her'.

11.18am: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip.

Charming: The GT account on bodybuilding.com which belongs to Gable Tostee, the man questioned but not charged following the 14th floor balcony death of Warriena Tagpuno Wright, includes this post in which he says he describes his encounter with a 21-year-old he met via Tinder, but who freaked out and ceased all online contact with him

Getting rated": Gable Tostee who is reportedly GT' on the bodybuilding Facebook style site bodyspace, appears to rate women out of ten. In this post, he says he had sex with two women in one night, one of whom he only rate '4/10'

'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you.Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.'

Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added, 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.'

Last month, 'G T' posted a message describing women as 'young sloots' who he described as  'headcases'.

'Had a 21 year old Tinder date come over for drinks, we’re getting along fine, start kissing, feeling each other,' G T wrote.

'She’s small so I go to hug and lift her up and take her inside from the balcony but she totally freaks out, mumbles something about getting back to her parents and bolts out the door. Deletes me off both Tinder and FB.

'Maybe I acted too abruptly and snapped her out of her little lust-trance by manhandling her.'

Earlier posts dating back several months have him saying he, 'banged two girls tonight. First one was 4/10 not worth mentioning didn’t look like her pics and I couldn’t even finish’.

In April, he posted a photograph which matches that of Gable Tostee and, apparently speaking about the calibre of girls whose attention he had attracted online, he writes, 'been matching mostly 7s, not sure if it's slowed down lately or something'.

Warriena Wright, from Lower Hutt, north-east of Wellington in New Zealand's north island, was seen with Mr Tostee on the balcony at the Wahroonga Place apartment he was living in before tragedy struck.

Warriena Wright, 26, (pictured, right) was a lovely young woman, friends say, who was passionate about animal welfare and had been enjoying a break from New Zealand on the Gold Coast attending a friend's wedding when she tragically fell to her death from the balcony of a Gold Coast apartment (above, left)

Witnesses said they had heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from the 14th floor.

'I heard her screaming once, then she stopped. Then she screamed and then she stopped again. I think she screamed a third time and after that I heard a bang,' a witness - only identified as Tania told Nine News.

'Very upsetting, very upsetting, I couldn't believe it.'

Another witness, Adam, who lives on the 17th floor said: 'By the sounds of things it's happened on my side of the building, right by my bedroom window.'

Ms Wright's Facebook page show the New Zealand woman had been having a great time visiting Australia for a friend's wedding. She had travelled to the country alone on July 29, according to Nine News.

In one photo, she is seen holding a python while laughing in a posed photo in front of rocky backdrop at an Australian zoo.

Savana Lesa was with Ms Wright during her two-week stay in the country.

Ms Wright smiling and posing a python just days before her death on the Gold Coast, where she had been enjoying a two week vacation, attending a wedding and meeting up with old friends, and meeting via dating app Tinder with Gable Tostee (above, right). Tostee is allegedly the holder of a bodybuilding.com account in the name of GT, who recently boasted in the online forum about his sex life

Posting a tribute to her friend, Ms Lesa said she would never forget the animal lover whose page was filled with photos of animals.

'It was just like a few days ago we were hanging out, taking selfies relaxing on the beach, visiting the tallest building in Australia, cruising around and talking about the good times we had together as buddy ol pals making the best of our time together,' Ms Lesa wrote.

'Though my heart aches for you and my mind is still adjusting to the fact you are gone I will always cherish the best moments I have had with you while you were here.

'I will never forget you my dearest friend who I love and keep close to my heart forever.'

Ms Wright's mother, Beth Wright, who is a deacon of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Wellington, is believed to have flown to the Gold Coast.

Police are continuing their investigations into the circumstances surrounding Ms Wright’s death.

Mr Tostee, a computer expert, contacted Queensland police at 11am on Friday and was questioned for more than two hours at the Surfers Paradise station, accompanied by his lawyer, but was released without charge according to The Courier Mail.

It is believed Tostee - who was found guilty of supplying fake IDs to underage Schoolies with two of his friends which made them $30,000 eight years ago - had been drinking with Ms Wright.

Police were almost immediately on scene when a man raised the alarm but on arrival nobody was inside the unit from which she had fallen.

They are investigating if someone had been there but fled the scene when police came knocking.

'Voices were heard and noises were heard coming from the unit,' Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson told media.

'But the investigation at the moment is in the evidence gathering and information gathering stage, so we have numerous detectives working on the case - we are gathering a lot of information and we are interviewing a lot of people,' he told Radio NZ.

Following last weekend's interview with Mr Tostee, who is believed to have moved from the apartment to his parents' place, police seized CCTV footage from the apartment.

'Once we work our way through that process we'll sit down and determine the next direction for the investigation.'

No charges in relation to the 26-year-old's death have been laid, but the 26-year-old's death is being treated as suspicious by police and are appealing to the public for information.

Detectives want to speak to anybody who has been in contact with Ms Wright since she arrived or know of her activities in Australia.
