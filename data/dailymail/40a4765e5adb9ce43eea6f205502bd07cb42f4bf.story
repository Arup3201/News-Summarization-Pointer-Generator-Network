A five-month-old baby boy who was found with a cord around his neck has died in hospital three days after being found at his family home awhere his mother allegedly killed his two older siblings.

Jessica McCarty's five-month-old son Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children since Friday, the same day her other children, seven-year-old Laci and six-year-old Philip, were pronounced dead. 

The 33-year-old mother has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.

Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died  three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested

What happened to the happy family? McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Laci McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself

Police say none of the three murdered children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were discovered

The attempted murder charge could be upgraded.  

Christopher's father came home and found him with a cord wrapped around his neck on Friday at the house in Palm Bay, Florida.

McCarty's two other children with another father - Laci and Philip - were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night.

The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. 

Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found.

Letter left behind: Investigators say McCarty left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do'. The motive for the attempted murder-suicide is still not clear 

On Sunday, McCarty waived her right to appear at her first hearing, sending her attorney instead. 

In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appears in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape.

Investigators have since revealed that McCarty left a note at the scene addressed 'to my family' in which she says she is 'sorry for what she had to do'. 

The note included a special address to her young baby's father, asking him to 'keep Christopher's name alive'.

The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has still not been revealed. 

However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the Department of Children and Families for possible child neglect. 

The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. 

She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. 

Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. 

Christopher Swist, the father of the infant, also called police when he came home to find the children unconscious in a bedroom.

Disturbing find: McCarty's partner Christopher Swist came home on Friday to find his son (pictured together above) and McCarty's two other children unconscious. The older McCarty children were pronounced dead on Friday. The infant was found with a cord wrapped around his neck and spent the weekend on life support

McCarty allegedly sent pictures of blood inside the home to Swist, leading him to come home and investigate.

When he came home, he found his son with a cord wrapped around his neck and lying on a bed. Philip unresponsive in a corner and Laci unresponsive and wounded on a bed.

A autopsy on the two McCarty children was scheduled for Sunday.

Palm Bay police apprehended McCarty outside her home shortly after she called 911. 

Officers said they had to shoot her with beanbag rounds because she was 'uncooperative' and was armed with a butcher's knife.

McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. 

She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. 

After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. 

McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV.

The tragic incident has shaken the community and a prayer vigil for the three murdered children was scheduled for 8pm on Monday night. 

Following news of little Christopher's death, friends of his father started an outpouring of support on Facebook.

According to his profile, Christopher Swist is a former Marine.
