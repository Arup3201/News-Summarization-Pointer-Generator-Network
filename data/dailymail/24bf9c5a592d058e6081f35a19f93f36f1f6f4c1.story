A photographer has put together a series of portraits - all taken the moment after he has kissed his subjects.

Jedediah Johnson pictures the women and men smeared in lipstick after the interaction, with reactions ranging from shocked to bemused to some even seemingly yearning for more.

The 34-year-old from Chicago, Illinois, got the idea for what he calls 'The Makeout Project' after taking a personality test which said he liked to collect mementos of meeting people.

Perplexed? Photographer Jedediah Johnson has kissed more than 100 people before taking their portrait - resulting in some very different reactions

Very close friends: Most of the people involved in Jedediah's 'Makeout Project' are friends of his

Smile! Other participants appear on the verge of laughter as their picture is taken

He said: 'I once took a personality test that I felt was very accurate. It said that people with my specific personality type like to collect people and experiences. 

'That's what the Makeout Project is all about, my interaction with people and a shared experience between me and my subjects.

'Specifically, in the Makeout project I put on lipstick and kiss people. Then I photograph them.'

Ready for my close-up: The subjects have nowhere to hide with these close-up shots

Young and older: Jedediah's subjects included both men and women of all ages

State of shock: Other subjects just appeared surprised or dazed in the aftermath of the kiss

Jedediah daubs thick red lipstick on his own lips before carrying out the kiss. His arm appears in each frame tenderly holding the model's neck.

So far he has kissed more than hundred people - the subjects are mostly people Johnson knows and, in one instance, a cheerful-looking baby belonging to a friend.

Johnson told DNAinfo.com: 'My subjects are all aware of what I'm going to do ahead of time, but in the moment of the kiss anything can happen.'

The Makeout Project is being exhibited at the Art Museo at the InterContinental Chicago O'Hare until 15 April 2014.

Special memories: Jedediah got the idea for the unusual picture project after completely a personality quiz which suggested he liked collecting mementos of people

Pucker up: Some participants appeared to have received more than one kiss 

Surprising: Jedediah said anything can happen in the moment of the kiss

Self portrait: Jedediah Johnson takes a picture of himself - minus the lipstick
