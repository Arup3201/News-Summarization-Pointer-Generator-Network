U.S. President Barack Obama vowed today that America will continue it's eternal support for their top Mideast ally and assured Israel of his personal commitment to its security.

In his remarks at Israeli President Shimon Peres' house, he delivered a blunt warning to the country's foes, saying that the United States has the Jewish state's back.

Arriving in Israel on his first trip to the country as president, Obama told the Israeli people at an extravagant welcoming ceremony that 'peace must come to the Holy Land' and that goal would not be achieved at Israel's expense.

Glowing words; President Obama praised the long career of Israeli President Shimon Peres at their joint press conference held at his home in Tel Aviv shortly after Obama landed in Israel

Support: President Obama made it clear that the United States will continue it's unwavering support for the country

Old friends: President Obama said how President Peres refers to 'charm' as one of the biggest roles of any President, and Obama 'succumbed' to Peres' tools

The brief remarks made by both Obama and Peres came after a visit to the garden at the Israeli President's home where they planted a tree that Mr Obama brought over from the United States for the occasion.

U.S. backing for Israel will be a constant as the Middle East roils with revolution and Iran continues work on its nuclear program, he said.

'The United States is proud to stand with you as your strongest ally and your greatest friend,' Obama affirmed, as soon as he landed on the tarmac at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport.

'Across this region the winds of change bring both promise and peril,' he said, calling his visit 'an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our nations, to restate America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors.'

Symbolism: President Obama said that he was happy to return to the garden at President Peres' house which he saw the first time that he went to Israel in 2008 when he was a Senator

Taking action: President Obama brought this tree over from America and the two leaders worked together to plant it in President Peres' garden

Symbolic: Obama told the story of Honi and the carob tree, a famous parable from the Jewish text the Talmud, and said that it represents the two country's past and future friendship

Seeking to alter a perception among many Israelis that his government has been less supportive of Israel than previous U.S. administrations, Obama declared the U.S.-Israeli alliance 'eternal.'

'It is forever,' he said to applause as Israeli and U.S. flags fluttered in a steady breeze under clear, sunny skies.

Even before leaving the airport for Jerusalem, Obama offered a vivid display of the U.S. commitment to Israeli security by visiting a missile battery that is part of Israel's Iron Dome defense from militant rocket attacks. The United States has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the system with Israel.

Enjoying the welcome: Mr Obama was greeted by a children's choir

Obama and Netanyahu toured the battery, brought to the airport for the occasion. They met and chatted with soldiers who operate the system that Israel credits with intercepting hundreds of rockets during a round of fighting against Gaza militants last November.

'Let me say as clearly as I can: The United States of America stands with the State of Israel because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with Israel,' Obama said.

'We stand together because peace must come to the Holy Land,' he added. 'For even as we are clear-eyed about the difficulty, we will never lose sight of the vision of an Israel at peace with its neighbors.'

'The United States stands with Israel because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with Israel.

Public events: The itinerary is filled with joint press conferences where Mr Obama and Israeli leaders will make it clear that they are united against countries like Iran and Syria

Commemoration: President Obama signed the guestbook at Mr Peres' home during the tour

Signing off: President Obama's note in the guestbook said that it was an honor for him to visit Israel again

'We stand together because we share a common story patriots.

'Our alliance is eternal, it is forever.'

In their personal interactions, President Obama said that it was 'good to see you, brother' to President Shimon Peres.

To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he joked that it is 'good to see you.. and it's good to get away from Congress'.

Netanyahu,
 who sparred frequently with Obama over the course of the U.S. 
president's first term, was lavish in his praise for the president.

Reaching the people: During his remarks, President Obama stressed the importance of securing a safe future for Israeli children

'Thank you for standing by Israel at this time of historic change in the Middle East,' he said. 'Thank you for unequivocally affirming Israel's sovereign right to defend itself by itself against any threat.'

Although preventing Iran from 
developing a nuclear weapon is a top priority of both Israel and the 
United States, Netanyahu and Obama have differed in the past on 
precisely how to achieve both ends.

Israel repeatedly has threatened to take military action should Iran appear to be on the verge of obtaining a bomb.

The
 U.S. has pushed for more time to allow diplomacy and economic penalties
 to run their course, though Obama insists military action is an option.

Obama, who joked that he was 'getting
 away from Congress' by visiting Israel, planned to visit several 
cultural and religious sites aimed at showing his understanding of the 
deep and ancient connections between the Jewish people and the land that
 is now Israel.

He will also meet Palestinian 
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and travel to Jordan 
before returning home on Saturday.

But on an itinerary filled more with 
symbolism than substance, Obama's main focus is on an Israel that is 
increasingly wary of developments in Syria and Iran. Adding yet another 
dimension to the trip, Obama landed amid new questions about the Syrian 
regime's possible use of chemical weapons.

Obama has declared the use, deployment
 or transfer of the weapons would be a 'red line' for possible military 
intervention by the U.S. in the Syrian conflict.

Ahead of Obama's visit,
 authorities in Israel said they believed that chemical weapons may have
 been recently used in Syria, although U.S. officials have said they had
 no evidence to support the Syrian regime's claims that rebels were 
responsible for a chemical attack.

Welcoming: Much of the trip will be focused on how President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu interact as their relationship is known to be frosty

Headed down the path together: Israel is looking for the United States to take a firm stance against Iran and their fledgling nuclear program as it is seen as the biggest threat to the Jewish state

Matching moves: Both the President and the Prime Minister were recently re-elected so there is a need for them to work out their personal difficulties and find a way to collaborate

Proud pals: Prime Minister Netanyahu posted this picture to his personal Twitter account

Even though U.S. officials have set 
expectations low and previewed no major policy pronouncements, a clear 
measure of the success of Obama's Israel trip will be how much he is 
able to reverse negative perceptions.

The centerpiece of the visit will be a
 speech to Israeli university students on Thursday, during which Obama 
will again renew U.S. security pledges to Israel as it seeks to counter 
threats from Iran, protect its people from any spillover in the Syrian 
civil war and maintain its shaky peace accord with an Egypt that is now 
controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood.

Obama will make an almost perfunctory 
visit to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the 
West Bank town of Ramallah, where he will meet the embattled Abbas and 
assure him that an independent Palestinian state remains a U.S. foreign 
policy and national security priority.

The downed 'Beast': President Obama's armored limo broke down in Tel Aviv this morning as it was headed to the airport after the driver mistakenly put gas in the tank instead of diesel

Big mistake: The 18-foot car has an tank that holds 6.5 liters of diesel, and does not work when given gas

Can't take it: The car had to be picked up on a tow truck and it is unclear whether the problem was quickly fixed

American made: The car that President Obama drove off in after speaking at President Peres' house was definitely an incarnation of 'The Beast' given it's Washington DC license plates and 5-inch-thick doors

As Israelis warmly greeted Obama, 
Palestinians held several small protests in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Demonstrators in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip burned posters of Obama and 
U.S. flags, accusing the U.S. of being biased toward Israel.

In the West Bank, about 200 activists 
erected about a dozen tents in an area just outside of Jerusalem to draw
 attention to Israel's policy of building settlements. The tents were 
pitched in E1, a strategically located area where Israel has said it 
plans on building thousands of homes. The U.S. has harshly criticized 
the plan.

Israeli forces have swiftly dismantled
 similar encampments built by Palestinians in the past. Abdullah Abu 
Rahmeh, one of the activists, said Israeli forces surrounded the tent 
camp but had not moved in.

Despite not coming with any new plan 
to get the stalled peace process back on track, Obama plans to make 
clear that his administration intends to keep trying to get talks 
re-launched.

'To tell the truth, they can't stand one another,' a commentator for Israel's Channel 10 television said of Obama and Netanyahu just as Air Force One landed in Israel

Reassurances: President Shimon Peres said in an interview shortly before Obama's arrival that he feels more confident now that the U.S. will support Israel against Iran if the ever developed a nuclear weapon

Being heard: Mr Obama will spend much of his trip in Israel talking with President Peres (left) and Prime Minister Netanyahu (right)

Bring it in: Obama gives big hugs to both Peres (left) and Netanyahu (right)

Obama will close out his Mideast trip 
with a 24-hour stop in Jordan, an important U.S. ally, where his focus 
will be on the violence in Syria. More than 450,000 Syrians have fled to
 Jordan, crowding refugee camps and overwhelming aid organizations.

In his talks with Jordan's King 
Abdullah, Obama also will try to shore up the country's fledgling 
attempts to liberalize its government and stave off an Arab Spring-style
 movement similar to the ones that have taken down leaders elsewhere in 
the region.
