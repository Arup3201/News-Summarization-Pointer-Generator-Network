Ivan Lendl was back home in Connecticut with a tee time booked but, had he been sitting in his usual coach’s seat, he would have quietly purred his approval at Andy Murray’s return to Centre Court.

Fifty weeks have passed since the grand old arena was last open for business but, in these vastly different circumstances, we got a similar level of sangfroid from the great home hope as he exhibited on that heady afternoon last July.

David Goffin walked out looking like he had just come off the set of an X Factor audition, but his boy- band appearance hid a significant threat on what can be a treacherous afternoon for a first-time defending champion.

Nobody need have worried. With a new 
mentor replacing Lendl in the box, Murray turned in an excellent 
performance, his 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 victory suggesting he can again reach 
deep into this tournament.

The
 nation has been in the grip of a sporting malaise, but thankfully 
Britain’s No 1 tennis player seems immune and, with this potentially 
awkward occasion negotiated, it can be expected that he will still be 
around this time next week.

Murray
 was rightfully pleased afterwards, although did not wish to discuss his
 place in the wider pattern of the country’s fortunes, noting drily: 
‘I’m yet to hear Wayne Rooney discuss my matches at Wimbledon.’

He
 was, though, unusually bullish about his form, and clearly touched by 
the rousing standing ovation given to him upon emerging from those 
famous double doors: ‘That reception was very nice to come out to. I 
enjoyed the walk to the chair and then when I sat down it was time to 
get down to business.

‘I 
played very well. I hit the ball clean from the beginning of the match. I
 thought the second and third sets were a very high level when he was 
playing aggressively.’

History
 will record that the opening point of an occasion that has not been 
seen for 78 years — a British man defending the Wimbledon singles title —
 resulted in the diminutive Belgian firing the ball into the tramlines 
with his forehand.

It very 
quickly became apparent that there were not going to be echoes of his 
fellow Liegeois from 2013, Steve Darcis, who knocked out world No 1 
Rafael Nadal in such dramatic fashion. As on that day, the court looked 
totally different to the one which greeted  Murray when he faced Novak 
Djokovic in the final.

The 
virgin surface was a thing of verdant beauty, which can bring challenges
 all of its own to those not used to it. Goffin is a nimble mover, but 
it was notable how the much heavier Murray was so much more footsure.

Bar
 an early slip while serving in a third game, extracting an evil stare 
at the ground, the 27-year-old Scot fairly glided around while the 
Belgian took four tumbles on the slick new carpet.

This
 contributed to him spraying his groundstrokes all over the place in the
 first set, and Murray was a grateful recipient as he was clearly under 
strain. You rarely hear him exhaling so noisily at the start of a match 
as he did yesterday, which told you this was no ordinary contest.

His
 ease of movement on the turf is just one indicator of how he has become
 such a reliable fixture at Wimbledon, so supremely at ease that he has 
won 20 of his last 21 matches at SW19 (the exception being the 2012 loss
 to Roger Federer).

Most 
measures on his barometer indicated that his comfort level here has 
survived the twin blows in the passing 12 months of back surgery and the
 departure of Lendl.

Murray 
is always dialled in mentally at the All England Club in a way that he 
is not, for example, at Roland Garros, where he is less sure of the 
fundamentals in his game.

This
 was a good start for Amelie Mauresmo but you could put John Terry in 
prime position on his bench and still be almost guaranteed immaculate 
behaviour.

If anyone looked 
unnerved by the occasion then initially it was Goffin, the player with 
nothing to lose and who has previously shown that he can lift his game 
when faced with the sport’s aristocracy at the Grand Slams.

He
 only started to play to his full capabilities halfway through the 
second set, by which time the No 3 seed had secured his third break of 
the match.

Hello mum: Judy Murray was in her customary seat to watch her soon charge through

Thereafter Goffin
 provided an excellent test, which showed off just how versatile a 
player Murray is, and how his  relatively flat groundstrokes and ability
 to keep the ball low work so well on grass. Any match when your serve 
is not broken is a good one, and he may even have  welcomed the 
challenge of needing to save two break points in the fourth game of the 
third set, when his opponent was playing at a level that made his world 
ranking of 104 look a nonsense.

The
 Centre Court crowd, which only seems to bare any teeth when Novak 
Djokovic plays Murray (as happened in last year’s final and the very 
different Olympic semi-final) almost encouraged Goffin to come back into
 the match.

Yet from 40-0 up
 at 5-5 a shred of complacency seeped in and  Murray pounced to seal the
 decisive break. All very encouraging, because that is just what  
champions do.
