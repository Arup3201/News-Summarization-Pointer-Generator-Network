Annemarie Allport says the £3.7 million package she got is 'wholly inadequate' to meet her needs

The widow of a successful racehorse owner and trainer who died after jumping in front of a train is fighting her stepson for a bigger slice of her husband's multi-million pound fortune.

Annemarie Allport, 50, says the £3.7 million package she got - including the couple's £2.5 million farmhouse home - is 'wholly inadequate' to meet her needs.

Mrs Allport, of Penn, near High Wycombe, says she and her husband, David, had an 'extremely high' standard of living and she had devoted herself to him over 13-and-a-half years of marriage.

However, he was a manic depressive and heavy drinker, talked often of suicide and eventually killed himself under a train at Seer Green Station, near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in 2006.

He left behind his wife and a son from a previous marriage, Darren, as well as assets worth many millions of pounds, including his successful company, HOH Oilfield Services Ltd.

Although he had written a will leaving all but £25,000 of his estate to his wife shortly before his death, the document had not been properly witnessed and was invalid.

It meant that his assets were divided up based on an earlier will which Mrs Allport said did not make 'reasonable financial provision' for her.

The case reached the High Court last year, when Judge Judith Hughes awarded her a lump sum and property worth about £1.2 million, on top of the £2.5m Penbury Farm home.

But now she is challenging the decision, arguing that the judge took a wrong valuation of her husband's oilfield supply company and did not award her enough to keep her financially secure.

Kuldip Singh QC, for Mrs Allport, told Court of Appeal judges, Lord Justice Thorpe, Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Ryder, that the award was still not fair to the widow.

He argued that Judge Hughes had wrongly based her decision on the value of the company being £8.3m, when in fact it also had dispersible cash reserves of £5.5m.

It was also important that the judge take into account the lifestyle Mrs Allport had enjoyed before her husband's death when deciding how much she needed in future.

'As the authorities make clear, in the case of the widow of a wealthy man, which is the case here, where the estate can finance it, which it can in this case, reasonable financial provision means the provision of financial security for her throughout her remaining lifetime,' he said.

In effect, the judge had decided that - on top of the home, which no one disputed Mrs Allport should have - another £1.2m was reasonable for her, he told the court.

'The award made by the judge is wholly inadequate and, in any event, much or most of it will be required to pay Mrs Allport's liabilities and will not provide any, or any sufficient, security for her.

'The judge wrongly failed to understand that the lifestyle or standard of living enjoyed by Mrs Allport before David's death is something the court must have regard to when determining what amounts to reasonable financial provision for Mrs Allport.'

Judge Hughes herself had found their standard of living was 'extremely high', while Mrs Allport had been cross-examined on the basis that it was 'luxurious', the QC said.

Mrs Allport had also been a 'battered wife', who had given up her chance of a successful career of her own to be at her husband's side, he continued.

It meant she had sacrificed the chance to have her own children, since Mr Allport did not want any more.

'This was a case where David had serious problems,' the barrister continued.

'He was not an easy man to live with. He was a manic depressive, who was suicidal for many years. Throughout the marriage, he was a manic depressive, violent, almost an alcoholic, who drank heavily.

'Mrs Allport clearly looked after him and clearly she had contributed to a certain extent, because he himself in the 2006 will decided to leave her all but £25,000.

'The judge simply ignores her contribution.'

The appeal judges rejected some of Mrs Allport's grounds of appeal, but adjourned the question of whether the company was undervalued by £5.5 million.

No date was set for the next hearing.

Mrs Allport's step-son, Darren, who is married with children and lives in the United States, was not formally represented at the Appeal Court hearing.

Many of Mr Allport's racehorses' names were given the 'Hoh' prefix associated with his company.

He was best known for 1994 Molecomb Stakes and Prix Morny winner Hoh Magic.
