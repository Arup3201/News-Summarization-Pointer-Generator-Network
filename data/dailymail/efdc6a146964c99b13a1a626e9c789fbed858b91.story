Made a hash of things: Baby's odd name is revealed on Facebook

In an example of what could be the silliest name ever given to a child, it appears that one mother has christened her baby girl Hashtag Jameson.

However, instead of taking to Twitter, which spawned the now ubiquitous preface, the mother posted the announcement on Facebook, compounding her apparent #fail.

While it is not clear whether the screenshot is a joke, the possibility that a child has been named hashtag still exists.

While some have considered that the 
little girl will grow up to be the living embodiment of the degradation 
of the English language, others have simply despaired for the mother, 
whose last name is Jameson.

The caption that accompanies the photo says: 'Hashtag Jameson was born at 10 oclock last nite. She weys 8pounds and i luv her so much!!!!!!'

The image has spread across the internet and been met with universal criticism.

The
 news that there could be a child named after the word most associated 
with Twitter is reminiscent of the Israeli couple last year who named 
their girl after the Facebook 'Like' button.

Lior
 and Vardit Adler were apparently looking to call their child something 
unique so they stumped for the Facebook moniker to enable their child to
 stand out from the crowd.

What's in a name? Whether it is a joke or not, this child will forever be associated with Hashtag

But they are not the only parents who have picked names inspired by the social media revolution.

Gamal
 Ibrahim of Egypt called his baby girl 'Facebook' in honour of the 
website's role in the Arab Spring of last year, which led 
to the ousting of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak after 30 years in power.

How long before someone is named '@'?
