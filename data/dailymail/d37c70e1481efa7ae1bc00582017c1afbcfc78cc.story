Six months have passed since Alexis Sanchez arrived at Arsenal for £35million and one nagging question remains: what do you think they were smoking over there at the Nou Camp?

People are entitled to the occasional mistake — Wojciech Szczesny lost his place for taking a crafty puff on a cigarette, for example — but Barcelona’s is on another level.

With every passing week, with every goal and every assist in the colours of Arsenal, the decision to sell the Chilean last summer becomes more absurd.

Sanchez made the first and scored two himself here, drifting between brilliant and sublime in this rhythmic destruction of Stoke City.

Arsenal were interrupted, at times, by Stoke’s agricultural approach and their willingness to look for a fight at every opportunity. What the visitors got in return was a football lesson.

Sanchez operated at a different pace to those around him. In this kind of form he can play wherever he wants. He has now scored 12 goals and engineered another seven in the Barclays Premier League since he said his goodbyes to Lionel Messi and Neymar.

Arsenal, gathering momentum now, used the cushion of a three-goal lead to bring Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil from the substitutes’ bench in the second half. They are still a little way off, but when Arsenal play on the front foot like this, a team full of conviction and purpose, Arsene Wenger can afford to wait a bit longer for them.

Sanchez was mesmerising, waiting patiently for Laurent Koscielny to sprint back into the penalty area when the Arsenal defender had served him with the chance to set up the opener.

Sanchez paused, checking his movement until he could find Koscielny and then looked on with a good deal of satisfaction as the Frenchman directed his header beyond Asmir Begovic.

He scored a beauty in the 33rd minute, collecting Tomas Rosicky’s pass on the edge of the area and gliding past the outstretched legs in Stoke’s defence. The finish was top-quality, deceiving Begovic and the rest of the Stoke defence by giving it the eyes before opting to drill his effort inside the keeper’s near post. He deserved full marks for improvisation.

This was a decent response by Arsenal, putting the midweek trauma of Szczesny’s censure behind them with a performance full of conviction.

David Ospina is first choice between the sticks for the time being — and he kept his second successive clean sheet. The reality is he only had two saves to make here.

Arsenal controlled this game, adding a third when Sanchez’s 49th-minute free-kick somehow made it through the wall and into the back of Begovic’s net.

There was also another side to this game, a knock-on effect of Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat at the Britannia Stadium on December 6. Some scores were settled.

Mathieu Debuchy will be out for a good few weeks, nursing a dislocated shoulder after Marko Arnautovic shoved him into the advertising hoardings.

‘I didn’t see it,’ claimed Stoke manager Mark Hughes. Amazingly, Wenger said the same. ‘1-0 to the football team,’ chimed Arsenal supporters as Debuchy was carried off for an X-ray — and it was hard to disagree. Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross and Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud squabbled repeatedly, childishly holding each other’s shirts throughout.

Peter Crouch also escaped when referee Jon Moss failed to spot the Stoke forward elbow Nacho Monreal in the side of the head when they collided mid-air.

Had Sanchez not put this game well beyond Stoke, it certainly had the potential to spill over. Instead, Arsenal cruised in the second half.

The 3-0 lead gave Wenger the opportunity to field Walcott, sending him on to replace Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with just over 20 minutes left.

He should have scored when Sanchez put him through, racing away from Philipp Wollscheid and Erik Pieters before skewing his effort wide of Begovic’s far post.

Sanchez has now scored 12 Premier League goals following his double on Sunday afternoon

Ozil dusted off the cobwebs as well, making his first appearance in the team since rupturing knee ligaments in the defeat at Chelsea in October. A dissatisfied Giroud made way and it seemed to make sense when he went and sat out the final 18 minutes of this victory alongside the brooding figure of Szczesny.

It will take some time for Ozil to get up to full speed again and Wenger admitted it could be two or three weeks before the World Cup winner is ready to start.

This appearance was a taster, a reminder of the good life at Arsenal after such a long period spent on the sidelines.

By the time the Germany international was on for Giroud, the damage had been done because Sanchez had put this game way beyond the limited ambitions of this Stoke side.

The man who cost a packet when he moved from Barca continues to leave everybody short of breath.

Crystal Palace want to sign Yaya Sanogo on loan this week, despite the Frenchman missing a medical on Friday. 

The Arsenal striker was booked for the procedure at the end of last week but didn’t show up, leaving the move in jeopardy. However, Palace are still hopeful of getting the deal over the line this week, with boss Alan Pardew keen to bolster his strikeforce.

Arsenal will ramp up their interest in Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko this week.

Sissoko is a £16million target for the Gunners and said yesterday: ‘If (Arsene) Wenger calls, I’ll have a man-to-man discussion with him and then we’ll see. Arsenal has always been the club of my heart.’

Travel chaos meant Stoke fans had a nightmare journey home.

A problem between Rugby and Milton Keynes affected trains from Euston station in London. Their defeated team, who have never won at the Emirates in any competition in seven attempts, travelled home by coach.
