A fare dodger is being hunted by police after pulling a pistol on a ticket inspector who tried to stop him boarding a train without paying.

The gun-toting commuter was captured on surveillance cameras waving the handgun in the face of the metro worker at Rågsved station to the south of Stockholm.

'The assailant screamed at him to let him through, but he didn't, so he pulled a gun from his waistband,' a spokesman for Stockholm police told the Aftonbladet newspaper.

Terrifying: A fare-dodging commuter points a pistol in the face of a ticket office worker on the Stockholm metro after he was prevented from leaping the barriers

Threats: The assailant screamed at the inspector to let him through, a police spokesman said

The gun threat happened on a busy evening just before last Christmas, but footage has only now been released after a court granted permission because all other leads had been exhausted.

Stockholm police spokesman Peter Tapper said: 'We have released the video which shows the man pulling out the gun because he was not allowed to go through the barrier without a ticket.

'He was demanding to be let through but when the ticket inspector refused, he pulled out the gun.'

Police believe that the gun was loaded, which means the man is wanted on suspicion of making aggravated illegal threats.

As their suspect was carrying the gun, officers believe he may well be involved in other crime.

The incident happened at about 8.30pm on December 19, The Local reports. 

CCTV footage shows the gunman trying 
to leap over the barriers, which on Stockholm's metro are above head 
height, before threatening the ticket office inspector with a pistol to 
let him through.

He made off after his attempt was unsuccessful. All police efforts to track down the suspect since then have proved fruitless.

Hidden: The unknown gunman had the pistol hidden in the waistband of his trousers

Criminal: The fact that he had a gun has led police to suspect the man may have been involved in other crime

Mr Tapper said police suspect that the man might be from overseas so they are hoping that the picture is used internationally in a bid to find a name.

He said: 'We want to know who he is and where he is. We suspect that the gun was certainly illegal and may well have been used in other crimes.

'From what we can see the gun was loaded so the threat was probably very real.'
