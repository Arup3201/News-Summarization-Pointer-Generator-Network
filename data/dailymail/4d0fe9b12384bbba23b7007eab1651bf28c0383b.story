A U.S. soldier has undergone extensive surgery to amputate both of his arms and legs after he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) while on foot patrol in Afghanistan.

Despite his horrific injuries, Army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills's first thought was not for himself - but for the three fellow soldiers who were also injured in the blast.

'He was the one who stepped directly on it,' friend of 12 years David Pratt told Fox News. 'But the only 
thing Travis was concerned about was his guys. That's the kind of 
soldier he is.'

Hero: Army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills, left, has had both his arms and legs
amputated after he stepped on an IED while on patrol in Afghanistan 
last week. He is pictured in hospital with brother-in-law Josh Buck

The 25-year-old, from Vassar, Michigan, has undergone the drastic surgery in Germany and his wife Kelsey, who gave birth to their first child seven months ago, hopes he will return home on Tuesday.

Mills was injured while serving with the
82nd Airborne in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom - 
his third tour of the country. He was taken to Kandahar and then Germany for treatment.

He lost both of his legs above the knee, his right arm above the 
elbow and his left arm below the elbow, according to Kelsey Mills, who said she was 'astonished' her husband had survived.

She added that the last few days have been 'confusing and scary', but that her husband of four years has remained up-beat and positive despite his life-changing injuries.

Strong: Despite his horrific injuries, Mills's first thought was for his three fellow soldiers injured in the blast

Popular: Colleagues have paid tribute to the bravery of Mills (left). A medic who treated the soldier could not believe the reassurance he was able to offer his comrades on the way to hospital

Speaking to Fox News, Kelsey said her husband won the hearts of the medical staff by putting music on his iPad and performing a dance for them from his bed.

She said: 'He's born to be a leader and born for everyone to listen to him. His personality demands attention, and everyone that’s ever met him will remember him forever. He’s just that kind of guy.'

Thousands have shown their support for the injured soldier on Facebook and www.travismills.org, recounting stories of his bravery. Others have contacted the family directly.

Army medic Shane A. Waite wrote to Kelsey: 'You belong to a family of warriors. Other soldiers in the aircraft were injured and screaming. Your husband was more about them then himself (sic).

Happy: Travis and Kelsey Mills have been married for almost four years and have one daughter

Family man: Mills will return to his wife and seven-month-old daughter Chloe (pictured) on Tuesday

Loved: Kelsey has been updating friends, family and well-wishers on his progress on Facebook

'His face was dirty and there was dirt
in his eyes but he never shed a tear. I replay the moment when he 
looked at that soldier and winked to reassure him over and over in my 
mind.

'My crew is still on duty in his units area now. We go back to Kandahar on Monday but we won't be the same.'

The family has been able to update friends, relatives, colleagues and well-wishers with news of Travis's progress through Facebook and his newly-launched website.

His wife, who lives in Frisco, Texas with their daughter Chloe, used the site to tell friends the soldier was presented with a Purple Heart by a chaplain and Wounded Warrior representative on Monday.

They also gave him his wedding ring. 'He thought it was gone forever,' Mrs Mills wrote.

Hopeful: Kelsey, left and right (with Chloe), said the past few days have been 'confusing and scary'

Support: Colleagues and friends wish Staff Sgt. Mills a happy birthday. He turned 25 while in hospital

She added: 'The nurse 
told me what an honor it is to be with Travis, and what a great man he 
is, and how everyone there loves him (as well as everywhere else).

'She was able to finally give him a glass of milk and he was so happy.'

The Travis Mills website also provides 
details on how to donate money for his medical care, including some 
expenses that will not be covered by insurance, according to the 
website.

Since he arrived in Germany, he has 
undergone four surgeries. The third, on Friday, was to clean his wounds 
and to check there were no infections.

Thousands of miles from home and family, Mills has been joined by his brother-in-law, Josh Buck, throughout the painful ordeal. A photo uploaded to Facebook shows the pair grinning in the hospital.

Updates: Kelsey has also set up a wesbite, www.travismills.org, to collect funds for his recovery

Kelsey added: 'He does not deserve this pain. If I could take it all 
away, I would. The only thing we can do is be there for him in his 
darkest hour and help him find his way home.

'He
has sacrificed more than anyone can imagine for this country. He is a 
true American hero, and he deserves all the respect and love in the 
world.'

His father Dennis Mills told Fox News: 'He sure is looking forward to getting back to the good ol' United States.'

More than 15,000 soldiers have now been wounded in action in Afghanistan or Iraq. Of these, 1,200 are amputees.
