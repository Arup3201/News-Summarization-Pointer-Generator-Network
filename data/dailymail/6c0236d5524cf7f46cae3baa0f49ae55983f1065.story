John Bercow has been accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ after pocketing thousands of pounds from ‘second jobs’ outside Westminster

Commons Speaker John Bercow has been accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ after pocketing thousands of pounds from ‘second jobs’ outside Westminster – while criticising other MPs who do the same.

Mr Bercow infuriated Tory MPs last week by appearing to back Labour plans to crack down on MPs being allowed outside earnings on top of their Commons work.

He said that ‘a lot of members of the public would expect MPs to do a full-time job’.

But this newspaper has established that before becoming the £142,800- a-year Speaker in 2009, Mr Bercow himself earned large sums from ‘outside earnings’ as a backbench MP.

The MPs’ register of interests shows Mr Bercow had a job worth up to £40,000 a year advising a firm in the Priory Group, the mental health treatment company behind the well-known Priory ‘rehab’ clinics.

Based on his declarations, Mr Bercow began the work in November 2008 but gave up the job in June 2009 when he was made Speaker. He also declared income for providing ‘communications training’ to staff of Chase Manhattan Bank between 1998 and 2002 but no further details were given.

And in 2002 and 2003, he was also a paid non-executive of energy firm Kent and Essex Wind Energy.

Mr Bercow, who has been MP for Buckingham since 1997, gave up his outside interests when he took the Speaker’s chair in 2009.

The promotion led to his basic MP’s salary being more than doubled while he and his family also moved into the taxpayer-funded, ‘grace-and-favour’ residence in the Commons.

Last night, Tory critics said Mr Bercow had no right to criticise MPs, who earn a basic £67,000, for having second jobs. 

Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: ‘Given that the Speaker used to have outside jobs, many people will think his comments against them are rank hypocrisy. 

Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, pictured, told undercover reporters that he had a usual fee of between £5,000 to £8,000 for a half-day's work for representing private companies

It is pretty rich for him to talk about MPs’ extra earnings as he lives in a grace-and-favour house, gets paid as much, if not more than, the Prime Minister and also has a very generous pension.’

Mr Fabricant also pointed out that Mr Bercow, who has previously been accused of ‘Labour bias’, made his latest remarks ahead of an attempt by Ed Miliband to change Commons rules and bar MPs from paid directorships and consultancies.

Mr Bercow’s remarks on the long-established practice of MPs having second jobs, but having to declare them, came after two former foreign secretaries, Tory Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Labour’s Jack Straw, were embroiled in a ‘cash-for-access’ row.

He said: ‘People should not be in Parliament to add to their personal fortune.’

Last night Mr Bercow declined to comment on the ‘hypocrisy’ claims. But his spokesman said: ‘The Speaker has held no paid position outside his office since his election to the chair in 2009. Details of his salary and pension are matters of public record.’
