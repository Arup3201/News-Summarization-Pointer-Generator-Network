David de Gea will be in goal for Manchester United at Arsenal on Saturday despite dislocating his finger only last week.

United manager Louis van Gaal confirmed Sportsmail's story of earlier this week that the Spanish international has made a remarkable recovery from an injury that at one stage looked set to keep him out for two or three week. 

David de Gea will start for Manchester United against Arsenal despite suffering a dislocated finger 

Louis van Gaal confirmed that David de Gea, Angel di Maria and Michael Carrick should all be fit

Michael Carrick is expected to be ok after picking up a groin injury on England duty

Daley Blind will find out the full extent of his knee injury in 10 days time

Daley Blind: Knee injury 

Luke Shaw: Hamstring injury 

Marcos Rojo: Dislocated shoulder

Rafael: Muscular injury

Ashley Young: Groin/Pelvis injury

Phil Jones: Calf/Shin injury

Radamel Falcao: Calf/Shin injury

Jonny Evans: Ankle/Foot injury

Jesse Lingard: Knee injury

'De Gea is fine,' said Van Gaal. 'He is good.' 

Van Gaal also confirmed that Michael Carrick is likely to be okay despite suffering a groin injury training with England while Angel di Maria has trained after taking a knock playing for Argentina in midweek.

'There is no question mark about him,' he added.

Left back Luke Shaw is a doubt, however, while midfielder Daley Blind will not know the full extent of his knee ligament injury until a brace is taken off in 10 days.

Van Gaal added: 'He will have another scan. It's not as bad as the doctors thought after the game but it will still be a long story, I believe. Not six months or so, though.'
