Roy Hodgson will hold talks with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after Raheem Sterling complained of fatigue ahead of England’s win in Estonia.

The 19-year-old first admitted leg weariness to coach Gary Neville last Saturday during England’s final training session ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier.

Sterling then relayed the information to Hodgson who, together with members of his backroom team, took the decision to put him on the bench despite the forward being anxious to be in the starting line-up.

Sterling views criticism of him for complaining of tiredness as unfair.

Hodgson, who admired Sterling’s honesty, said: ‘I should speak to Brendan, but it really is very simple and I am sure he understands the situation. Raheem has played a lot of games recently and it is the first year in the Champions League for Liverpool for a while, so the games have been quite high pressure.

‘He looked a bit tired when he came up and I will just tell him that — that he was feeling a bit tired and I made the decision to play (Adam) Lallana, but he recovered well enough.

‘He is 100 per cent fully fit and really it was just a decision on my part. Brendan has been talking about the pressures Raheem has been under and the fatigue that may have set in a little bit, so I am pretty sure he will be dealing over the next month with Raheem as he sees fit.’

Hodgson made another attempt to move away from the idea that the players are run into the ground when away with England. 

Rodgers, who expects to see Sterling back in training at Melwood on Tuesday and is likely to play him against QPR on Sunday, criticised England’s training methods in September after striker Daniel Sturridge ruptured his thigh muscle.

The Liverpool boss claimed Sturridge needed two days to recover from a match, but Hodgson insists there is no medical evidence to prove this is beneficial.

Hodgson said: ‘Raheem might say it is something that is becoming ingrained in him and that he felt the need to talk about being tired more than he would normally do.

‘I don’t think there is a lot of medical evidence to support the two-day recovery.

‘I would expect players not to take it for granted that there will be two-day recoveries. On the other hand, it could easily be like this time when we did virtually nothing in terms of what I consider to be training the day after the (first) game and we did 40 minutes including warm up the day before the (second) game and that was at a fairly low level intensity.’
