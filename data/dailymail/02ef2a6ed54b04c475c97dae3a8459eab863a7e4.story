A  mother was shamed into losing more than 10 stone after being left mortified by a photograph which she believed proved she was bigger than a buffalo.

Janine Furr, 29, tipped the scales at 25st 7lb  and could barely fit into a size 30 dress after years of eating unhealthy takeaways. 

But the final straw came for the mother-of-three  when she saw a photo of herself sitting on the back of a wooden buffalo in 2012.

Janine Furr, 29, tipped the scales at 25st 7lb  three years ago and struggled to squeeze into a size 30 but now she's shed 10st on a healthy diet 

The final straw came when she saw this snap of her on a wooden buffalo in the park and was convinced that she was wider than the large model

She was convinced that she was wider than the large model, which she even got stuck on top of at a children's playground in Nottingham. 

Doctors told Janine that - due to her size - she qualified for a gastric band, but the determined housewife decided to take matters into her own hands to shift the excess pounds.

She signed up to her local Weight Watchers and lost 10st 6lb over the next three years.

Janine even managed to shed 1st 7lb while she was pregnant with her third child Jasmine, now 20-months-old.

Now Janine, from Netherfield, Nottingham, is a healthier 15st 7lb and can fit into a size 16 dress with ease.

Speaking about her weightloss journey, she said: 'I was huge and my health suffered as a result. But the final straw was when I struggled to get on top of that buffalo and even got stuck there for a while.

Doctors told Janine that due to her size, she qualified for a gastric band but she joined a slimming club and lost the weight herself naturally

Janine is a healthier 15st 7lbs  and slips into a size 16 with ease thanks to her new lifestyle 

Janine replaced a diet of takeaway pizzas and curry with healthier fruit and vegetable options

She explained: 'I had to be helped off it. When I saw the photo  I was absolutely mortified. I was actually wider than a buffalo. I knew then I had to do something. 

'I go to that park regularly now and have no trouble getting on and off it. It feels unreal actually to look back at that picture now. It is a big achievement.'

Janine, who also has a seven-year-old daughter, Halea, and a son, Tyler, four, said she had severe confidence and health issues after piling on the pounds during her teens.

Janine tried to avoid walking long distances or climbing stairs when she was at her heaviest

She says she didn't feel comfortable eating in public because people looked at her and assumed she was always eating because of her size

She added: 'I've always been quite big. But when I had two young children I was tired all the time. I had pain in my knees often and just wanted to change things really.

'I would have tried to avoid walking long distances or climbing stairs when I weighed my heaviest. It was difficult to play with the kids at times. People used to laugh at me and snigger and make comments about my size in public. It wasn’t nice and knocked my confidence.

'There was one incident where somebody took a picture of me, laughing at me when we were out. It wasn't even discreet. That really bothered me. I did not feel comfortable eating in public because people looked at me and assumed I was always eating because of my size.'

After joining Weight Watchers, she soon replaced a diet of takeaway pizzas and curry with healthier fruit and vegetable options.

Janine added: 'I lost weight gradually but each week I could see the scales going in the right direction and as the plan is so flexible, I could fit it around my life. I didn’t want it to happen overnight as I knew I had to lose the weight in a healthy and sustainable way.

'I love walking and swimming and I have more confidence. My life has transformed and I feel completely different. I can now run around after my three children and I’ve introduced healthy food into our family meals too.

'I’m now a bit of a clothes addict. It’s great not having to feel limited to the plus-size brands.'
