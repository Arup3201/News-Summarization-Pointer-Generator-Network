A mother-of-four is serving a lengthy prison sentence after tricking her family and friends into believing she was pregnant with twins - before falsely claiming they had died in childbirth.

Leslie Wilfred, 37, also convinced doctors and friends in Thomasville, Georgia that her four other young children suffered from serious illnesses, leading one to undergo invasive surgeries.

She was eventually diagnosed with Munchausen syndrome and Munchausen-by-proxy, in which sufferers make up illnesses for themselves and their children and often induce the symptoms.

Two years after she was sentenced to eight years in prison, the lead investigator in the case has spoken to FoxNews.com about her string of lies and how they were discovered.

Plot: Mother-of-four Leslie Wilfred, pictured with her husband Chris, pretended her children were ill and that she had given birth to stillborn babies - when she had never even been pregnant

'I've been in law enforcement for 30 
years and have been an investigator for 25 of those years. I've 
investigated everything from homicides to armed thefts,' Officer Bob 
Brettel said. 'I had never encountered anything like this before.'

He revealed how police learned of the scheme when Child Protective Services were interviewing her about her unruly stepson, and noticed she was talking about his attitude harming the unborn babies.

After claiming the babies had indeed died, CPS decided to investigate further and discovered the litany of lies, extending to all of her children.

Wilfred had four children when she married Chris - who also had a son of his own from a previous relationship - on June 23, 2007.

Wilfred claimed her then 13-year-old son had needed his gallbladder removed as a child after she took him to the doctor with frequent vomiting. She also claimed he needed a liver transplant.

She also had a daughter, 9, who suffered from leukemia, she said. The girl supposedly underwent chemotherapy and collection pots were placed around
town to raise money for her medical bills.

Guilty: Leslie Wilfred, left, was convicted of several counts of cruelty to children after pretending her kids were ill when they were not. Her husband, right, was convicted on one count for locking up his son

Doctors found that Leslie Wilfred had Munchausen and Munchausen by proxy.

In both conditions, the person 
purposefully fabricates medical conditions so that they can get attention or sympathy. Munchausen syndrome patients 
tell falsehoods about themselves, while in Munchausen by 
proxy, an adult will invent medical conditions for his or her child.

A dangerous facet of this is how they will often induce symptoms in the child to better illustrate the lie. Munchausen by proxy is 
typically considered a severe form of child abuse.

They belong to a group of conditions called factitious disorders, which are either made up or self-inflicted. If it is not discovered, it can lead to death from self-inflicting the harm or because of harming the child.

Dr. Marc Feldman, an international expert in the disorder, told Fox: 'It
is a diagnosis of people who evolve lifestyles in which they travel 
from hospital to hospital, getting themselves admitted and subjecting 
themselves to surgery they don't need.

'What they have 
in common is this quest for sympathy – a desperate search and yearning 
for some kind of identity as a patient or the vicarious identity of a 
patient.'

Due to the dishonest nature of the condition, it is hard to say how many people in the U.S. suffer from Munchausen syndrome, but it is considered to be rare. It generally more typically occurs in men than in woman and most often affects young adults.

Wilfred claimed that her other children also suffered from medical conditions and that one child, who was then 11, was the result of her being raped by her co-worker. This was never reported to police.

Around this time, Wilfred also claimed she had fallen pregnant with the couple's twins. She took pictures of her rounded belly - but did not reveal to friends or family that she had actually had her tubes tied ahead of the marriage, making a pregnancy impossible.

In 2008, the couple called the police about Chris' son, claiming he had threatened the family with a knife. They complained he was unruly and neighbors rarely saw him leave the home.

After the knife incident, Child Protective Services launched an investigation and Wilfred regularly met with a caseworker - who noticed some bizarre behavior.

'During this whole period of time when 
the mother would be talking to his attorney, she made several references
about his behavior being responsible for the safety and wellbeing of 
her unborn twins,' Brettel told Fox.

It was almost as if she was predicting the future.

On November 10, 2008, Wilfred called her husband and family from hospital to say the twins, who she had been carrying for five months, were stillborn and had been cremated.

Three days later, the family gathered to mourn the babies at the family's local church, where their ashes were placed in teddy-bear shaped urns and ultrasounds were put on display.

Little did the family know that the urns had been ordered five days ahead of the 'birth' and that the ultrasounds belonged to a stranger - and had been downloaded from the internet.

When CPS learned about the 
stillbirths, they contacted Brettel, who in turn contacted the hospital -
and found they did not have records of her check ups or birth.

As
the investigation continued, officers learned that the eldest son did 
not need a liver transplant and they questioned whether his gallbladder 
had been removed unnecessarily.

Mistreatment: She claimed one of her daughters, pictured, had leukemia and one of her sons needed a liver transplant. Investigators said they are glad they learned of the case before they were seriously hurt

They also learned that the daughter had not suffered from leukemia and Wilfred had instead lied about going for chemotherapy treatments.

In yet another startling twist, officers then searched the couple's home and found that Chris' son had been tied in a small wooden box inside a linen closet every night as the family slept.

The couple said that the boy was violent and needed to be constrained - but analysis of him showed he only suffered from PTSD as a result of being locked in the box.

Wilfred herself underwent evaluations and found that she had Munchausen syndrome - but no other major mental health issues.

'She is not psychiatrically ill in the 
sense of a major diagnosis like schizophrenia,' Dr Marc Feldman said. 
'There are no psychiatric excuses for what she did.  She has a 
personality disorder which means she has long-term, self-defeating ways 
to deal with stress.'

Cruelty: After authorities learned of her lies, they searched the home and found Wilfred's stepson was locked in a box in the closet each night in their home, pictured. The couple claimed the boy was unruly

Feldman, an expert in Munchausen, added that people with the condition often have passive partners; Chris claimed he had no idea that his wife had been lying.

Wilfred eventually pleaded guilty to several counts of 
cruelty to children and theft by deception for the donation buckets, and she is currently serving an 
eight-year sentence.

Chris was convicted of one count of cruelty to children, and both 
parents have been ordered not to contact their children without permission from the court.

The children have not suffered any permanent physical damage and are living in foster care. But Brettel said he believes the children could have suffered much worse harm - or death - if the case had not been discovered.

'She was pretty much in denial about 
doing anything significantly wrong,' Brettel said of Wilfred.  'She didn't think 
she had done anything to harm her children.'
