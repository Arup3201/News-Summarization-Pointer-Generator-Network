Lionel Messi won’t have mastered the nuances of Cockney rhyming slang by the time his whistlestop tour of London’s East End came to an last night.

But the West Ham crowd simply couldn’t ‘Adam and Eve’ it, after seeing arguably the world’s best footballer strutting his stuff in their Upton Park manor. And this football-loving corner of the capital was treated to more than enough Messi magic.

Even in second gear, the little Barcelona genius was sensational — eventually winning this international friendly for his side with a penalty.

Man of the Match: Lionel Messi

Referee: Andre Marriner 6.5.

Spectators had queued long before kick-off to catch a glimpse of him, thousands of them making sure they were in their seats just to watch him warm up. 

Wearing his orange adidas boots, the Argentine then led his team-mates out to face an understrength Croatia team.

There was a strong Premier League presence in their starting XI: Pablo Zabaleta, Angel Di Maria, Sergio Aguero, Santiago Vergini, Erik Lamela and Spurs newcomer Federico Fazio all featuring. 

The crowd gave Messi a rapturous reception when his name was announced. And it took just five minutes for him to bring them to their feet; a mesmerising run from right to left had the Croatia defence bewildered only for Manchester City’s Aguero to fluff his lines in front of goal.

The run sparked roars of ‘Arg-en-tina Arg-en-tina’, though they stopped abruptly in the 11th minute when Croatia took the lead with a wonderfully crafted goal finished by Anas Sharbini. 

There were first-half spells when Messi cut a frustrated figure, yet an air of anticipation gripped Upton Park every time the ball was at his feet.

He set up Aguero again in the 18th minute, playing a perfect pass to outwit Marin Leovac, before Aguero and Di Maria forced goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic into good saves.

Slowly but surely, Messi’s influence grew. He stole a yard of space on the edge of the area to play a one-two with Aguero, but Marko Leskovic produced a goal-saving challenge.

Messi combined with Cristian Ansaldi before rippling the side-netting with 10 minutes of the first half still to play. When Argentina were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area, hundreds of camera phones were at the ready. But Messi’s free kick did not trouble Kalinic as Croatia held their lead.

Thankfully, for all in attendance, Messi returned for the second half. But the Argentine was nowhere near the ball when the stadium erupted two minutes later. 

Carlos Tevez, the second star attraction of the night, left his seat on the bench to start warming up. The former West Ham striker remains a revered figure for his heroics during the club’s controversial relegation escape in 2007. 

Fans were cheering again in the 48th minute when Ansaldi’s long-range effort took a deflection off Aguero to put Argentina level.

It was like Messi was a West Ham player when Leovac scythed him down in front of the dugout, supporters berating the Croat.

Then in the 57th minute, Messi produced a moment of magic as Argentina took the lead; delivering a slide-rule pass to Aguero, who was fouled in the area by Kalinic. Messi, 27, stepped forward to score his 45th international goal.

Chants of ‘Messi, Messi’ echoed round Upton Park — but even that burst of adulation was topped by the ovation Tevez was afforded when introduced in the 61st minute. The announcer’s decision to introduce the Juventus striker as ‘West Ham legend’ was, perhaps, pushing it — but it mattered not as the decibel levels rocketed.

This night, though, belonged to Messi, even if he did miss a brilliant chance late on. 

Even for Tevez, playing second fiddle to Messi is not to be sniffed at.
