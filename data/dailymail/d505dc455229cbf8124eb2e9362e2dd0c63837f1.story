Pope Francis has just landed in the Philippines - to a crowd of thousands, church bells and an airport greeting from President Benigno Aquino.

The Pope is in Asia, having begun his trip just days ago with a stop in Sri Lanka, for a week-long tour, and has already caused a huge spike in interest when it comes to travel in the region.

Flight searches to Sri Lanka have increased by 19 per cent, while the numbers for the Philippines have increased by a whopping 51 per cent week on week from last year.

Pope Francis has just arrived in the Philippines - and already travel searches for the region have spiked

The Pope's six-day Asian tour includes stops in Manila, where adoring crowds waited, and Sri Lanka

Interest in Manila has seen a particular increase, up 60 per cent already, according to Cheapflights.co.uk

Cheapflights.co.uk spokesperson Oonah Shiel attributes this 'halo effect' to the Pope's genuine mass appeal.

Of particular interest to travellers is Manila, where His Holiness is expected to deliver a huge open air mass on Sunday, January 18, to over 5 million attendees.

'Searches regarding the Filipino capital are up 60 per cent and counting,' she said.

Following his stop in Sri Lanka, where the Pope canonised its first saint, travel interest has gone up by 19%

'As well as driving short-term interest in flights to the region, the Pope's visit is expected to raise awareness of the plight of the more marginalised groups in the area and provide a longer-term boost to ethical tourism,' Shiel added.

In fact, Pope Francis has already canonised Sri Lanka's first saint, after calling for unity in the conflict-hit nation.

'Every step he makes, every car ride he takes, every moment he stays with us is precious for us,' said Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.

 'Seeing him pass by is a grace.'
