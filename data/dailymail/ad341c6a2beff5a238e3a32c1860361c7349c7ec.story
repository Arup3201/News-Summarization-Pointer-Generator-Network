Devin Nottis, 19, of Pascagoula, Mississippi, was charged with grand larceny after stealing a flamingo

A college student has been arrested after a bungled prank led to the deaths of two Chilean flamingos at the Hattiesburg Zoo.

Devin Nottis, 19, of Pascagoula, Mississippi, is charged with grand larceny, Hattiesburg police spokesman Lt. Jon Traxler said on Thursday. 

The University of Southern Mississippi student was arrested on Wednesday night for stealing a female flamingo. 

Police said that during a scavenger hunt for new pledges, Nottis took a flamingo instead of taking a picture of the bird. 

The executive director of the organization that runs the Hattiesburg Zoo says a female bird was taken at 1.08am on Tuesday and found later that morning, several miles away. 

Rick Taylor says it was returned to the zoo and had to be euthanized because of its injuries.

Officials said a second flamingo was injured in the incident and died on Wednesday.

The male flamingo was the mate of the female and sustained his injuries by defending his mate.

The zoo posted surveillance footage from the park on its Facebook page on Tuesday with an appeal for anyone with information to come forward. 

The message said: 'An eye witness also saw a group of people scaling the Zoo fence around the same time last night, carrying what appeared to be a large bird.'

The zoo said that the death of the female flamingo cut its ability to breed more of the exotic birds by 25 per cent. 

In a statement to MailOnline today, The University of Southern Mississippi said it had indefinitely suspended the Delta Mu Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (PIKE) at the school, following the arrest of one of its pledges 

The student has also been placed on interim suspension by the University. 

During that suspension, the 19-year-old is barred from being on the university campus for any reason other than to go to the Dean's office.   

'The University is taking swift and appropriate action in response to this incident,' said Southern Miss Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Joe Paul. 

'This is a terrible and heinous act that has occurred, and inconsistent with the values of our institution.' 

Hattiesburg Zoo released surveillance footage on Tuesday to catch the culprits who broke into the zoo and stole a pink flamingo which eventually led to the death of that bird and another 

Four individuals could be seen on security tape covering their faces. Devin Nottis, who attends Southern Mississippi university has since been arrested
