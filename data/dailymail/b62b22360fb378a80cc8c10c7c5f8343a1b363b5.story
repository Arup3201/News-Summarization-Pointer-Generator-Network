Manchester United winger Angel di Maria was at Carrington for treatment on his day off on Wednesday as Louis van Gaal grew cautiously optimistic that the club’s record signing will be fit for Sunday’s game against Chelsea.

Di Maria — perhaps Van Gaal’s star signing so far — limped off during United’s 2-2 draw at West Brom in the Barclays Premier League on Monday night, with what appeared to be a thigh injury.

There has been no official word on his fitness from the club but the former Real Madrid star was at Carrington for some light remedial work on Wednesday and sources have suggested the Argentina international has a decent chance of making Sunday’s game against the league leaders at Old Trafford.

‘It was just a kick,’ said one Old Trafford source.

Chelsea look set to travel to Manchester without their top scorer Diego Costa and his replacement Loic Remy, who are both injured.

United, meanwhile, are without captain Wayne Rooney who is serving the final game of a three-match suspension after he was sent off against West Ham.
