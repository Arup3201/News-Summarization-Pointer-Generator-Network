Two years have passed since the brutal murder of 15-year-old Annie Kasprzak but time has brought no relief for her mother as the teenager's killer remains at large.

Miss Kasprzak was found beaten to death in the Jordan River in Draper, Utah on March 11, 2012. Her murder remains unsolved.

Her mother Veronica Kasprzak said on Monday that Annie's family strongly believe that she left home the night before her body was found to meet someone she knew and that person is now living with the burden of taking her daughter's life.

Annie Kasprzak, 15, was murdered two years ago and her brutally beaten body dumped in the Jordan River in Draper, Utah. Her killer has not yet been found

Mrs Kasprzak told KUTV: 'We strongly believe Anne left to meet somebody she knew, somebody she trusted.

'We don't believe at this point that it was a stranger or some random person.'

The
 grieving mother also said that they were not looking for the 'bad guy' 
but perhaps just a neighborhood kid.

Mrs Kasprzak described the months 
of waiting to find her daughter's killer as 'devastating'.

Her
 mother added: 'We're not giving up. Anne deserved far more than what 
she got. And we are committed to making sure we get as many answers as 
we can.'

Annie's mother Veronica Kasprzak says that she believes her daughter left home on the night she died to meet someone that she knew and trusted

Annie Kasprzak was last seen by her parents on March 10, 2012. Her body was found in a river the following day

Weeks after Miss Kasprzak's death, police charged two known felons with the girl's murder. However last March, both Daniel Ferry, 32, and Veanuia Vehekite, 31, were cleared of any involvement following an extensive investigation.

The
 teen was last seen by her parents on March 10 after she argued with 
them and went to her bedroom to listen to music. She later left the 
house and her parents reported her missing the following morning.

Police reports from the time revealed that Miss Kasprzak spent 30 minutes chatting on her phone to people 
with unavailable numbers before she left the house.

Annie Kasprzak's bloody and bruised 
body was pulled out of the Jordan River two years ago after a 
passer-by noticed blood and a shoe on a footbridge. 

Investigators had to use scars, clothing and dental records 
to identify her body. Wounds on 
her hands indicated that she had tried to protect herself during a struggle.

A memorial of red balloons and flowers was left at a bridge over the river where the teenager's body was found two years ago

The girl's family have offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who might have information about her killer.

The Draper police department have 
dedicated a detective with finding the Miss Kasprzak's killer and are 
working with other agencies including the FBI.

In
 a statement, police said:'The Draper Police Department's investigation 
into Anne Kasprzak's murder is ongoing.  This investigation continues to
 be the highest priority of this Department.

'Investigators
 are diligently working all aspects of the case and when it is 
appropriate, plan to present a strong case to the Salt Lake District 
Attorney's office.'

Anyone with information about the murder, should call Draper police at 801-840-4000.

Anne Kasprzak's bruised and bloody body was pulled out of a Utah river in February 2013. A witness claims a man smashed her head against a wall when she turned down his sexual advances
