Danna Gomez wields a mascara wand like a pro and knows the exact method for creating the illusion of high cheekbones - but this hot new YouTube star is only five years old.

And the precocious  make-up expert, from Colombia, is at the centre of a debate that such a young child should be offering beauty advice in online make-up tutorials.

Not only does the little girl show how to apply eyeliner and foundation, she explains how to use contouring techniques to make noses appear slimmer.

Five-year-old Danna Gomez has created a series of beauty tutorial videos, teaching her viewers how to apply make-up for special occasions including romantic Valentine's Day dinners

While some viewers have found the videos cute and rather amusing, others have criticised Danna's performance, claiming the videos are inappropriate for a girl so young

The Spanish-language videos see Danna imitating the popular beauty advice videos she's seen on the web, as she explains how to apply a range of products.

With her mature delivery she has notched up millions of viewers with tutorials including how to apply special make up to celebrate a romantic occasion like Valentine's Day.

But while Danna has won plenty of praise from those who found her performance cute, much criticism has come from others saying her videos are all part of the pressure for children to grow up too fast.

One viewer, Miguel, said: 'Why can't we let our children be children, why do we have to rush them into being adults before they are ready?' 

You Know Who wrote that it was 'a perfect example of a sexualization of little innocent children'. 

Maki Rodriguez posted that real beauty doesn't come with paint on faces and that natural beauty is still the best.

The criticism hasn't stopped Danna however, who enthusiastically explains to followers how to put on perfect and long-lasting make-up.

The response to Danna's video were reported in Zecasecas Online, which said, 'while many users find it charming, others disagree with a small girl putting on make-up and recording herself.' 

'With a very natural niceness, the girl explains how to put on make up after putting on a base on the face, on the shadows, eye liner, the lip pencil and even a heart on the cheek.

The article finishes: 'The post on Facebook has been shared over 150,000 times and many women say that she does her make-up better than they do, though lots of others disapprove of her putting on make-up so young."

The tutorials were filmed by the five-year-old's aunt Denisse Gomez, who thought they were so cute she posted them online, where they quickly went viral on social media. 

She explained in a Facebook post that for Danna the make-up videos are just 'play' and she posted them with the permission of the little girl's mother.

Responding to the negative comments, Denisse said: 'Danna loves showing off and enjoys being on the camera, and as long as she's having fun and doing it on her own initiative then what is wrong with it? 

'Children have always played adult games like pretending to be doctors and nurses, or mummies and daddies, or even fireman or cowboys.

'So what is wrong with imitating an adult in playing around with make-up?' 

Concerns are bound to be raised over Danna's attempts to slim her facial features with make-up, in the style of the heavy contouring technique loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian

Danna's tutorials, while based on the videos she has watched online are still a five-year-old's take on beauty.

While some instructions are eerily adult, such as her guidance on where to place foundation, others are undeniable humorous.

'And then let's get powder on the face and neck and I'm going to put some in my ears. And I'll take this (the brush) and with it you have to do it really hard on the cheeks.'

Concerns are bound to be raised over Danna's attempts to slim her features with make-up however, in the style of contouring loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. 

In her Valentine's Day make up tutorial, Danna tells her audience, 'with white shadow, we will make the nose smaller and above also white shade and blend well.'

Though the online star quickly reflects her age again, by drawing a heart on her cheek using eyeliner and ending things up with 'and the final touch will get this tiara!' 

'And then I'm going to take a little white eye shadow, here, and here, and if you get it too strong like me, you have to diffuse it finely,' viewers have noted the eerily adult language used by Danna in her make-up videos

Danna's videos mix adult delivery with other, more amusing touches, like drawing a heart on her cheek using eyeliner and wearing bright pink eye shadow with a tiara and Princess Elsa costume
