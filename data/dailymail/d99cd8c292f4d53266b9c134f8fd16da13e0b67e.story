Two alcoholic bears fed beer and caged at a Russian restaurant have been saved thanks to Brigitte Bardot's animal rights charity.

A court ordered the bears to be confiscated from the restaurant in Sochi, in south-western Russia's Krasnodar Krai region, after they were found lying in a filthy cage surrounded by rubbish.

The pair developed drinking problems after customers were permitted to buy them beer, but Russian zoos refused to take the bears on because of their addiction, which made them bad tempered.

Finally, British animal welfare organisation Big Hearts Foundation stepped forward and with backing from the Brigitte Bardot Fund, helped rehome the two animals to a bear park in Romania.

The two alcoholic bears were confiscated from a restaurant in the city of Sochi, Russia, after they were found lying in this filthy cage (pictured) surrounded by rubbish. Patrons regularly bought them beer for 'fun'

The alcoholic bears are believed to have lived in the squalid cage at the back of a restaurant for 20 years

The restaurant owner, Dzheniks Uzaroshvili, rejected the suggestion that it was cruel to give the bears alcohol, and said: 'Beer is good for the bears because of the Sochi climate.'

The court heard the bears often had a spotlight unexpectedly shone on them on them as people laughed at their reaction.

According to evidence given in court, the spotlight was the reason one of the bears was virtually blind.

Anna Kogan, from the British Big Hearts Foundation, said that the bears had been served alcohol to entertain guests in a cage at the back of the restaurant for around 20 years.

Alcoholic bears suffer in the same way as humans including unpredictable tempers and withdrawal symptoms

The alcoholic bears, which are currently going cold turkey, will now be moved to a huge Bear Park in Romania

Ms Kogan said: 'The problem is that they are alcoholics, and it is even more difficult to wean bears off alcohol than is with human beings.' 

Experts said that alcoholic bears suffer all the same problems that humans do, including unpredictable tempers and the withdrawal symptoms that a human being might expect.

Vets say with proper care the bears will be able to beat their addiction.

After a lengthy appeal the British charity won backing from the Brigitte Bardot foundation and a new home has now been found.

Prosecutors decided to confiscate the bears after 500 activists protested outside the restaurant in 2012

The alcoholic bears, which are currently going cold turkey, will now be moved to a huge Bear Park in Romania.

But first they must be confiscated from the restaurant, where they remain, and moved to the Romanian port of Constanta by funds paid for by the Brigitte Bardot foundation.

They will then be sent to the Bear Park in central Transylvania, just 20 miles from the city of Brasov.

The sanctuary has offered to re-home the bears and provide them with treatment for their alcohol problems.

However, Ms Kogan says they are still looking for a company to transport the bears - which they cannot do until the Russian authorities act on the court order and confiscate them. 

She said today: 'The bears are still with the restaurant owner. 

'The Ministry of Natural Resources, which is the body that has to take them away, is taking their time with acting on this decision as there is no where in Sochi to put them temporarily.

'There is a home for these bears in a rehabilitation centre in Romania. 

'Big Hearts Foundation and others are happy to organise the move when the authorities start cooperating with us on document preparation and veterinary assessments of the animals.'

The sanctuary is home to around 70 bears who have been mistreated and have spent years in captivity.
