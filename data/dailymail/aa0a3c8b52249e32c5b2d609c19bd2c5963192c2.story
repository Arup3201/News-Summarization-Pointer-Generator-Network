The U.S. Air Force's top secret military plane which has orbited the Earth for nearly two years is set to finally land this week, and could touch down today.

The X-37B space drone, otherwise known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, has been in flight since December 2012 on a secret mission.

The mystery spacecraft, which skeptics say could be used for spying, is expected to land at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

The U.S. Air Force's top secret X-37B military plane which has orbited the Earth for nearly two years is set to finally land today

The shuttle took off from Cape Canaveral, in December 2012, but will finally come back to Earth this week

X-37B's original mission was supposed to last nine months, but it has now been circling the earth for far more than double that amount of time (artist's impression)

Its original mission was supposed to last nine months, but it has now been circling the earth for far more than double that amount of time.

Skeptics believe the 29ft (8.8m) shuttle's mission is defense or spying-related, but the military plane's purpose remains a highly-guarded secret.

In 2011, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance. 

The Orbital Test Vehicle, which is solar powered, is designed to land automatically.

Two hangars at the Vandenberg base have been cleared, ready for its arrival.

Colonel Keith Baits, 30th Space Wing Commander, said: 'Team Vandenberg stands ready to implement safe landing operations for the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, the third time for this unique mission.'

The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite

The plane has been in space for a total of 672 days, far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days.

The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three secret missions to date.

Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit.

The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall.

It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg).

The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth.

The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year. The second space plane took off on March 2011 and came back to Earth in June 2012.

According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles. 

Both top secret missions ended at Vandenberg base, but this may soon change as Boeing, which built the shuttles, is working to renovate a NASA hangar at the Kennedy Space Centre, which could become X-37B's new home.

All missions so far have launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

While the airplane looks like NASA's retired space shuttles, it has its own identity.

Like a shuttle, it is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft.
