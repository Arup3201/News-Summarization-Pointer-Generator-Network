Two Americans were awarded the Nobel economics prize on Monday for studies on the match-making taking place when doctors are coupled up with hospitals, students with schools and human organs with transplant recipients.

The work of Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley has sparked a 'flourishing field of research' and helped improve the performance of many markets, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.

Roth, 60, is a professor at Harvard University in Boston. Shapley, 89, is a professor emeritus at University of California Los Angeles.

'This year's prize concerns a central economic problem: how to match different agents as well as possible,' the academy said.

Shapley made early theoretical inroads into the subject, using game theory to analyze different matching methods in the 1950s and '60s. Together with U.S. economist David Gale, he developed a mathematical formula for how 10 men and 10 women could be coupled in a way so that no one would benefit from trading partners.

While that may have had little impact on marriages and divorces, the algorithm they developed has been used to better understand many different markets.

In the 1990s, Roth applied it to the market for allocating U.S. student doctors to hospitals. He developed a new algorithm that was adopted by the National Resident Matching Program, which helps match resident doctors with the right hospitals.

He also helped redesign the application process of New York City public high schools, ensuring that fewer students ended up in schools that were not among their top choices.

Similar formulas have been applied to efforts to match kidneys and other human organs to patients needing a transplant, the academy said.

Roth was in California with his wife when he got the call from the prize committee at 3:30 a.m.

'We missed the first call because we were asleep, but we had time to wake up and think that might be what it was,' he said. 'My wife is going to go out and get us some coffee, and maybe we'll absorb it.'

He said he didn't expect things to change too much, and that he would teach a class at Stanford on Monday.

'But I imagine that they'll be listening with renewed interest,' he said. 'I think this will make market design more visible to economists and people who can benefit from market design.'

'Matching ... is about how you get all the things that you can't just choose but you also have to be chosen - so getting into university, getting married, getting jobs,' he said.

'You can't just have what you want; you also have to do some courtship and there is courtship on both sides and we study the market place processes by which those types of courtship are resolved.'

The official prize citation said the two were awarded for 'the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.'

Shapley learned that he and Roth had won the $1.2 million award from an Associated Press photographer and another journalist who went to his home in Los Angeles early Monday.

'Matching ... is about how you get all the things that you can't just choose but you also have to be chosen.'

'I consider myself a mathematician and the award is for economics,' Shapley said. 'I never, never in my life took a course in economics.'

Shapley is the son of renowned 
astronomer Harlow Shapley, whose work early in the 20th century included
helping estimate the true size of the Milky Way galaxy.

'Now, I'm ahead of my father,' Shapley said. 'He got other prizes ... But he did not get a Nobel prize.'

'Even though these two researchers 
worked independently of one another, the combination of Shapley's basic 
theory and Roth's empirical investigations, experiments and practical 
design has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the 
performance of many markets,' the academy said.

David Warsh, who follows academic economists on his Economic Principals blog, says Roth's work has revolutionized the way organs are matched to patients. Before Roth, he says, 'there were no economists in that business at all. He's really changed it, and saved a lot of lives.'

The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was the last of the 2012 Nobel awards to be announced.

Prestige: The economics prize was created by the Swedish central bank in Nobel's memory in 1968, and has been handed out with the other prizes ever since. Each award is worth 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $1.2 million

It's not technically a Nobel Prize, because unlike the five other awards it wasn't established in the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist also known for inventing dynamite.

The economics prize was created by the Swedish central bank in Nobel's memory in 1968, and has been handed out with the other prizes ever since. Each award is worth 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $1.2 million.

Last year's economics prize went to U.S. economists Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims for describing the cause-and-effect relationship between the economy and government policy.

The 2012 Nobel Prizes in medicine, physics chemistry and literature and the Nobel Peace Prize were announced last week. All awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.
