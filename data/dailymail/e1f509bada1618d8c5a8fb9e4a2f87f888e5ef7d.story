Police could have prevented the Boston bombings if they had been more vigorous in their investigation into a grisly 2011 triple murder that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was connected to, it was alleged today.

Law enforcement authorities have accused local cops of botching the investigation after Tamerlan was flagged up to them numerous times in the wake of the killings and they failed to act on it.

Had they apprehended him, the bombings that left three dead and more than 260 wounded may never have happened, sources believe.

On September 12, 2011, Brendan Mess, 25, Erik Weissman, 31, and Raphael Teken, 37, were found in an apartment with their throats slit and marijuana sprinkled over their bodies. There was no sign of forced entry and $5,000 cash was still in the apartment.

Involved? Tamerland, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, could have been involved in a 2011 triple murder, investigators have said. Forensic evidence and cell phone records reportedly tie them to the scene

Investigators at the time said the 
murders were 'targeted and not a random act of violence' yet no one was 
ever charged in the case.

Following the bombings, local 
investigators started looking at a connection with Tamerlan as he and 
Brendan Mess had become close friends after training together in a 
boxing and martial arts gym.

When they did, they found forensic evidence from the crime scene that matched the Tsarnaev brothers and cell phones records show they were in the area at the time of the killings..

Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to

When police were told about Ibragim Todashev's connection to the brothers, they arrested him and believe he was in 
the process of implicating himself and his friend Tamerlan in the 
murders when he was shot dead by FBI agents.

According to the New York Times, 
federal investigators had been gathering information against Tamerlan even before questioning Todashev using 'old-fashioned'
police work.

They 'went through his phone, did interviews, got his contacts - a combination of all that', a senior law enforcement official said.

During the initial investigation, 
police concluded the murders were a professional job as a result of a 
low-level drug dispute.

This was due to the lack of evidence, the 
savageness of the attack and the position of the bodies - all stomach 
down with their heads turned to the side.

But relatives and friends of the 
victims have criticized this decision and said investigators failed to 
do basic policing work, especially after Tamerlan was named a number of 
times and was known to be a frequent visitor to the Waltham apartment.

But three law enforcement officials 
familiar with the case told the Times that Massachusetts state troopers 
and the Waltham police never questioned him - either as a potential 
suspect or as someone who could provide valuable information about the 
victims.

It was when Tamerlan did not show up 
to Mess' funeral and seemed to show a lack of emotion when talking about
it, that mutual friends became uneasy and reported it to police.

One friend, who did not want to be identified, said: 'I felt that 
the police were not really looking in the right places.

'I told them there were only two Muslims I 
knew of who hung around the group of friends, and because of the 9/11 
date, the fact that Tamerlan and Brendan’s last girlfriend were Muslim 
stood out.'

Scene: Investigators said there was no sign of forced entry so it is likely the men knew their murderers

After the murders no one went to the Wai Kru martial arts gym where Brendan Mess worked out with Tamerlan - and later Todashev.

John Allan, the gym’s owner who first
flagged up the men's friendship, said he was shocked by Tamerlan's reaction to his friend's murder when they talked about it a few days
later.

'As I said something, there was kind 
of a smile on Tamerlan’s face, and he laughed it off', he said. He laughed off the
fact that he was murdered, like: "Aw, man. It’s crazy right? Huh huh. 
It’s crazy right? I guess if you do that, that’s what’s going to 
happen".

'There was no hint of grief, that really shocked me.'

Brendan Mess' girlfriend, who also 
did not want to be identified, said she told investigators that  
Tsarnaev, who she knew as 'Tam', was at the Waltham apartment regularly 
but they also did not allegedly follow up.

When questioned by the Times a law 
enforcement official denied they were told about Tamerlan saying: 'Don’t
you think if someone had told us to take a look at him and that he had 
information, we would have talked to him?'

Tamerlan
was killed following a gunbattle with police, a day after the FBI 
released images of him and his younger brother at the Boston marathon.

They
allegedly dumped two pressure cooker bombs crammed with shrapnel and 
detonated them near the finish line, killing three people, including an 
eight-year-old boy, and injuring 180 more.

His brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar,
was found hiding in a boat parked in a suburban yard and suffered a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck.

He appeared in court yesterday where he pleaded not guilty to 30 counts against him.
