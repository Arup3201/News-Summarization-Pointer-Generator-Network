President Putin said today military force in Crimea would be a last resort. Consequently, stock markets rebounded as did the Russian rouble

Stock markets rebounded today after president Putin said he saw no need to use military force in the Crimea and urged against economic sanctions.

Vladimir Putin told a news conference that Russia's use of force in Ukraine would be the 'last resort' and that sanctions being considered against Moscow by the West would be counter-productive.

Russian stocks and the rouble were up, while gold and the Japanese yen fell.

European stocks rose, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 1.8 percent - recouping over half of Monday's losses driven largely by the Ukraine crisis.

MSCI's all-country world stocks index, which tracks stocks in 45 countries, was up half a percent.

U.S. stock index futures were up more than 1 percent - suggesting a higher open on Wall Street.

Scott Meech, co-head of European equities at Union Bancaire Privee (UBP) said: 'It's still a very worrying situation but seems to have calmed down a bit.

'That's why we're seeing a bit of a recovery.'

Russian stocks, bonds and the rouble plunged on Monday as Putin's forces tightened their grip in Crimea - whose population is mainly ethnic Russian.

But after Putin's news conference today, the rouble-denominated MICEX stock index was up 5.2 percent, while the rouble rose 0.9 percent to 36.17 to the dollar.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose nearly 0.2 percent and Tokyo's Nikkei closed 0.5 percent higher as some foreign investors scooped up battered shares, although concerns over Ukraine kept the market on edge.

In currency markets, the euro and the dollar gained 0.6 and 0.4 percent respectively to 140.22 and 101.85 yen. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3770.

Geoffrey Yu, a strategist with UBS in London, said: 'Given three days worth of bad headlines, I think the market was just willing to take any sort of stability it can get.'

Following Putin's statement, European stocks rose - with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 1.8 percent. MSCI's all-country world stocks index was also up half a percent

Yields on top-rated euro zone government bonds rose as demand for low-risk assets waned.

Yields on lower-rated Italian and Spanish debt held near eight-year lows, resilient to global risk aversion to an extent that highlights how the market's perception of their creditworthiness has changed.

'Turn the clock back a few years and these markets would be hit by contagion,' said Nick Stamenkovic, a bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh.

Russian stocks, bonds and the rouble plunged yesterday following continued military occupation in Crimea

'But you see more signs of growth in these countries ...(and) the (European Central Bank) has backstops in place.'

U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also rose, and were last up 4.7 basis points at 2.65 percent.

Gold, another traditional safe haven, fell after rallying nearly 2 percent on Monday. It was last down 0.8 percent at $1,337.90.

Brent crude oil fell about 1.6 percent to $109.38 per barrel.
