A man and his wife have died after their plane crashed on the way back from France.

Businessman Carl Whiteley and wife Kathryn are understood to have been killed when their light aircraft crashed off St Ouen's Bay, Jersey, today.

The aircraft crashed five miles out to sea in thick fog while on approach to Jersey Airport at 10.20am.

Jersey Police have yet to identify both occupants but in a statement released by Mr Whiteley's Derby-based firm, Belmont Regency Group, colleagues have paid tribute.

Loss: Businessman Carl Whiteley and wife Kathryn were killed when their light aircraft crashed off St Ouen's Bay, Jersey, today

Light aircraft: The plane - a Cessna similar to the one pictured - is U.S.-registered but UK-based. It ditched into the sea off Jersey this morning

Brett Hannon Managing Director said 
today that Mr Whiteley was piloting the Cessna Crusader aircraft when it
 plummeted into the sea.

He said: 'Belmont Regency group Ltd are dismayed to hear of the death of one of our founder directors, Carl Whiteley and his wife Kathryn Whiteley when the plane he was piloting crashed into the English Channel on a flight from northern France to Jersey this morning, Wednesday September 4. 2013, on his way back home.

'Our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time.

'Carl jointly founded the company in 1982 with myself and apart from being business partners for over 31 years, Carl was a close friend who will be greatly missed.

'The fondest memories will remain with myself and our staff of our dear departed colleague.'

A States of Jersey Police spokeswoman said: 'Following a comprehensive search and rescue mission by the RNLI, fire and rescue service, Channel Island Air Search and assisted by private boats and HMS Northumberland, we now believe there were no survivors of this morning's light aircraft crash.

'The States of Jersey Police will now be working alongside the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) to establish what happened.

'We have yet to formally identify the people on board but believe them to be two UK residents.

'Family liaison officers from Jersey are supporting the family of those we believe to be involved. We ask that those families are given privacy.'

The UK-based and American-registered Cessna plane was heading for Jersey airport from Dinan in France, an airport spokesman said.

A Jersey airport spokesman said parts of the wreckage had been recovered this morning.

Visibility was believed to have been poor around the Jersey coast this morning but it is unknown if this had anything to do with the tragedy.

Police were called at 10.21am but no time has been given for when the aircraft lost radio contact.

AAIB investigators are currently travelling to the island to begin their inquiry and a recovery operation is ongoing to reclaim the bodies, police said.

Jersey airport put 'flow control' in place after the crash to manage air traffic and warned commercial flights could face some delays.

The
 first eight inbound flights of the day were all delayed this morning, 
some by a number of hours but flying at the airport has appeared to have
 returned to normal.

The Manche Iles Express passenger ferry Marin Marie was diverted to help with the rescue operation.

A spokesman for the RNLI confirmed that two boats were launched as part of the rescue operation.#

Paul Mott, a forecaster with MeteoGroup,
 the Press Association's weather division, said: 'Certainly there was 
some low cloud and fog around Jersey airport and poor visibility this 
morning.

'It was about 200 metres at 7am. That gradually thinned but 
by 9am it was still quite misty and still some fog and low cloud over 
the English Channel.'
