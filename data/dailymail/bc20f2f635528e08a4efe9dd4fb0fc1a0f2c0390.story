A shocking photograph of a sick and distressed coyote cramped into a tiny cage has again placed Animal Planet's troubled Call of the Wildman reality show firmly under the spotlight.

According to the whistleblower who took the depressing picture, the coyote had been captured and held for three days beforehand for use in a scripted scene in which the show's star,  Ernie 'Turtleman' Brown, Jr., lures and traps a wild coyote lurking in a barn.

Even more damning for Animal Planet, the person who provided the photograph alleges that when the time came to film the scene, the coyote was too sick, so the show runners paid $500 to have another one transported from Ohio to Kentucky - which is illegal.

Caged: This is the coyote that was allegedly held while sick for Animal Planet's Call of the Wildman show for use in filming in May 2013

It is then alleged, that even with the replacement coyote on set, the producers still brought the sick one on location for the May 10, 2013 filming, 'just in case something happens'.

The scripted segment was aired in the episode Lured into Danger in July 2013 and was filmed on May 10, 2013 in Waddy, Kentucky, three days after the photograph of the caged coyote was taken in Bowling Green Kentucky.

According to an investigation by Mother Jones, Sharp Entertainment - the production company commissioned by Animal Planet to make Call of the Wildman - obtained the first coyote through the Kentucky Nuisance Wildlife Control Operators (NWCO).

Mother Jones' investigation also alleges that even though the sick coyote was captured by a licensed wildlife control operator - the show broke Kentucky regulations that forbid keeping captive wildlife for more than 48 hours.

More-so, the investigation also got hold of government documents that show state wildlife regulators had been warning Turtleman about violations and animal welfare issues since March 2012.

According to the allegations of the man who provided the photograph, a NWCO official captured the coyote at the request of the show and 'was transported for hours in cramped conditions'.

However, it is not known if the coyote was kept inside the cage it was pictured in for three whole days, but regardless, as the May 10 shoot approached the coyote was sick and had begun to limp.

The fact it was brought to the filming location along with its replacement left the source who provided the photograph to Mother Jones, 'sickened'.

Another person who witnessed the coyote said that it 'was just sitting there, so they had to get another coyote fairly quickly.'

Internal documents obtained from Sharp Entertainment reveal that the second coyote was obtained from Kokas Exotics, a farm in Ohio that breeds exotic animals.

Its owner, John Kokas made the news in 2011 when one of his own kangaroos attacked and injured him.

The new coyote was fetched by staffers from Sharp on May 9 for $500 and brought to Kentucky.

This is against Kentucky law and while the state can exempt zoos or researchers to do this, it is uncommon.

Chad Soard, an official with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources told Mother Jones the main concern is rabies.

According to Kentucky officials there are no recorded exemptions dated on May 9 or 10 for the transportation of a coyote into Kentucky.

So far representatives from Animal Planet and Sharp Entertainment have refused to comment on the matter.

However, Sharp’s Vice President Dan Adler denied the practice of snaring animals deliberately for the reality show and insisted that the 'coyote in question was determined to be sick by the licensed officers on location, and the determination was made not to film with it because production policy is not to film with sick or injured animals.

'On the day in question you bring up, a licensed NWCO officer arrived to a location with a coyote he had caught after receiving a nuisance call, and when he brought it to us, the licensed NWCO officers on set moved it from the smaller cage it was caught in to an appropriately sized cage.'

In its tagline, Call of the Wildman is supposed to give nusiance wildlife 'a second lease on life.'

During previous allegations that the show is too scripted, Sharp Entertainment has said that  'NWCO officers are compensated for bringing animals to production that they have captured in the regular course of their work.'

Commissioned: Animal Planet have said 'The notion that there is a culture of 'neglect' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd'

Animal rights groups, already sickened by prior allegations of abuse by the show have called for the show to be axed.

'It appears that numerous Kentucky animal-protection laws were violated in the way that this ailing coyote was handled, and PETA is filing a complaint with the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources,' said People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Foundation Deputy Counsel, Delcianna Winders.

'PETA will also file a complaint with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding numerous apparent violations of the federal Lacey Act in the production of this episode of ‘Call of the Wildman’ and numerous others.'

Earlier this year, Mother Jones allaged that the production team associated with Call of the Wildman mistreated animals and 'found "evidence of a culture that tolerated legally and ethically dubious activities.'

The allegations included a zebra being sedated and animals being trapped beforehand only to be caught again as part of a script.

Legal warnings for Call of the Wildman: In August 2013, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife sent Ernie Brown a warning letter that some of his actions on the show were a violation of his Nuisance Wildlife Control Officer permit

Animal Planet released a statement to CNN's New Day, saying in part:

'The life and welfare of all animals is of paramount importance to Animal Planet. It is core to our ethos that every animal's life has value... The notion that there is a culture of 'neglect' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd.

'Claims in the 'Mother Jones' article were brought to the production company's attention nearly nine months ago. Where appropriate, Sharp Entertainment promptly instituted changes to further ensure the welfare of animals while filming the series.' it read.

Dan Adler, senior vice president of Sharp Entertainment, said "The idea that there is a culture of neglect or abuse on the show is completely false ... Everyone on the show from staff to talent love animals.'

'The idea that animals are killed or drugged on 'Call of the Wildman' is false,' he said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which enforces the Animal Welfare 
Act, told CNN in January it is 'fact-finding' but has not launched an 
investigation.
