Hull have had a bid of £2million rejected for Sheffield United defender Harry Maguire.

The 21-year-old is valued at £4m by the League One side who have completed the signing of Blackpool defender Harrison McGahey, 18, pending a tribunal.

Hull have also lodged an improved offer for Andy Robertson at Dundee United.

Maguire is seen as one of the brighter prospects in the Football League.

Hull – equipped with huge amounts of 
television money for avoiding relegation last season – may return for Maguire.

They remain hopeful on Robertson, who has attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs.

On the ball: Robertson in action for Dundee United

Andrew Robertson is living 
proof that achieving a fairy-tale rise is still possible within the 
often cynical world of modern football.

Little
 more than 12 months ago, the left-back was turning out for Queen’s Park
 – the Glasgow amateur club – in the less than glamourous surroundings 
of the Scottish Third Division.

Fast
 forward to the present day and he is now a full Scotland international 
coveted by several English clubs. Dundee United have so far rejected two
 offers from West Ham United, while Everton manager Roberto Martinez has
 previously considered a move for the 20-year-old.

Robertson will end up playing in the Barclays Premier League. The only questions are precisely where, when and for how much?

His
 signing by United manager Jackie McNamara was a masterstroke. It will 
earn the Tannadice club another windfall after this week selling teenage
 midfielder Ryan Gauld to Sporting Lisbon in a £3million deal.

United
 have, though, been every bit as good for Robertson as he has been for 
them. McNamara has been the perfect mentor to refine his talents. An 
exceptional full-back for Celtic and Scotland during his own playing 
career, he has provided all the pointers required.

The
 result has been a thoroughly modern left back. Robertson has solid 
technique, pace, tenacity and an adventurous attacking style. He 
instantly established himself as a first pick at Tannadice and continued
 to blossom as last season developed.

A
 glorious solo goal against Motherwell – crowned by a 20 yard finish - 
further raised his profile and increased the number of scouts studying 
his form. By April, he had been deservedly named as the PFA Scotland 
Young Player of the Year.

It
 was meteoric progress but Robertson calmly took it all in his stride. A
 first call-up for the Scotland Under-21s last autumn led to a training 
session with the senior squad. Gordon Strachan was hugely impressed by 
the youngster’s ability and demeanour, prompting a debut full cap as a 
substitute in a spring friendly against Poland. 

Robertson
 was then handed a first start for his country in the 2-2 draw with 
Nigeria in May and looks poised to become a Scotland regular for the 
next decade.
