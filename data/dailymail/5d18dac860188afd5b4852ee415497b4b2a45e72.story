Family fibs? The Obamas have given a personal insight into their lives

In the hot seat: President Obama and the first lady were interviewed by ABC News' Barbara Walters for a 20/20 holiday special to be aired tonight

‘He’s got a great life,’ Mrs Obama said of the three-year-old black and white dog. ‘He’s got it good.’

The
 Portuguese water dog does indeed have it good. On Wednesday, he got $41
 worth of gifts from PetSmart and there is also speculation that Bo was 
flown to Hawaii for the Obama’s family vacation.

Asked the same question, President Obama declined to answer, saying: ‘You know, Barbara, I’m going to pass on this one.’

When asked what the trait he most 
'deplored' in himself, President Obama responded: Laziness. Nothing 
frustrates me more than when people aren't doing their jobs...if I get 
lazy, then I get mad at myself.'

The President also admitted to lying in the interview, but only when the 'truth would hurt other people'

He said: 'Usually, the only time I lie is very personal interactions with family members, who you say, "You look great," and they don't. "Wonderful dress..." Uh, not so much.

The First Lady agreed, saying she would lie when the 'truth was not helpful'.

Probing: Babara Walters' questions were taken from the late-nineteenth century Proust Questionnaire, a series of personality questions

Walters' questions were taken from the 
late-nineteenth century Proust Questionnaire, a series of personality 
questions made famous by French author Marcel Proust which are regularly
 put to celebrities.

The interview delves into questions on their individual traits, virtues, and misconceptions.

Mr Obama said the biggest misconception about him is that he is ‘Spock-like’ – that is to say, ‘very analytical.’

He continued: ‘People who know me know that I am a softie.’

'I mean, stuff can choke me up very easily. The challenge for me is that in this job  I think a lot of times the press or how you come off on TV people want you to be very demonstrative in your emotions.'

When Barbara Walters asked President Obama what trait he most deplores in himself, he responded: ‘Laziness. Nothing frustrates me more than when people aren’t doing their jobs.’The comment is especially relevant as Mr Obama is fighting tooth and nail for an extension on the payroll tax cut. He and House Speaker John Boehner have famously clashed on the issue.On Thursday, the president called Washington ‘dysfunctional.’ He added: ‘What’s happening right now is exactly why people get so frustrated with Washington.’

When asked what three words they would use to describe eachother, the Obamas - who will celebrate their 20th anniversary next year- were nothing but complimentary of eachother.

The President answered: 'Beautiful, smart and funny' while the First Lady used the words 'Smart, sportsman, and father' to describe her huisband. 

The President  said he did not have a 'biggest pet peeve' for his wife.

But Mrs Obama, on the other hand, had plenty. ‘My list is too long,’ she told Walters.

In the interview, the President revealed a deep regret of not having learned a musical instrument and wished he had focused more on Spanish when he was at school.

'I would love to be able to speak Spanish fluently and play an instrument.' he said.

The full interview will air on Friday at 10pm ET on ABC.
