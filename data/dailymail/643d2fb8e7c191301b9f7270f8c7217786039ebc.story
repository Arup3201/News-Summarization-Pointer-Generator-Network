Social networking site Facebook has announced plans to introduce clickable hashtags for users.

The tool is already widely used on Twitter, as well as photo-sharing app Instagram, as a way for users to find out what others are discussing and following certain discussions.

Facebook users have already begun adding hashtags to comments and status updates, yet they weren't previously able to use them as a search tool.

Facebook has announced plans to introduce clickable hashtags for users. An example of how the hashtags will look is shown on the NBA Facebook page, pictured. People who want to follow news of the NBA Finals can click the tag and see all related posts that have also included the same hashtag

Facebook has now made this possible.

When a Facebook user now adds a hashtagged word or phrase to a post, other users will be able to click it and use it as a search term.

Hashtag phrases include multiple words stringed together.

They will be presented with a list of other users across the site that are also currently using that word or phrase and discussing the same things.

For example, when Facebook users watch a popular TV show such as The Apprentice, they can add '#theapprentice' to the end of their posts.

Other users who are also watching the show, or who aren't watching it but are interested in following what's happening, can click the hashtag.

The results will be shown as a list that users can scroll through and watch the discussion develop at a glance.

If the tool works in a similar way to how Twitter uses hashtags, the results will update in real-time.

Around 20 per cent of users will get the hashtags feature in the initial roll-out, with a full worldwide roll-out expected in the 'coming weeks.'

Hashtags are just one several new features that will be introduced to highlight discussions about events on Facebook.

In a post for the company, Facebook’s Greg Lindley said: 'To date, there has not been a simple way to see the larger view of what’s happening or what people are talking about.

'To bring these conversations more to the forefront, we will be rolling out a series of features that surface some of the interesting discussions people are having about public events, people, and topics.

Around 20 per cent of Facebook users will be given the #hashtag feature in the initial roll-out. The tool will then be rolled-out to all other users worldwide in 'the coming weeks'

1. Don't overuse # 

2. Don't use # where it isn't relative

3. Don't use more than three # in a single post 

4. Do create your own #mailonline

5. Do use your own # with an existing hashtag 

6. Be polite #thanks

7. Use it for searching #wiki

8. Search your # before you use it (if you think it might have other meanings) #ambivalent

'As a first step, we are beginning to roll out hashtags on Facebook.

'Hashtags are just the first step to help people more easily discover what others are saying about a specific topic and participate in public conversations.

'We’ll continue to roll out more features in the coming weeks and months, including trending hashtags and deeper insights, that help people discover more of the world’s conversations.'

Hashtags already feature prominently in popular music, with artists incorporating the punctuation into song and album titles, while the video for current number one single 'Blurred Lines' by U.S. RnB singer Robin Thicke features the artist’s surname and a hashtag flashing on screen throughout.

The BBC then used his song, and similar on-screen hashtags, during the opening sequence of the recent F1 Canadian Qualifying coverage.

Researchers from The Open University recently called Twitter's grip on hashtags a 'semantic goldmine'.

Analysts believe that the adoption of hashtags on Facebook will loosen this grip and make it possible for the site to target users with even more personalised advertising.

Commenting on the announcement, digital advertising company RadiumOne said: The omnipresence of the hashtag continues to grow and Facebook’s savvy decision to adopt and adapt the feature demonstrates the brands need to remain current and drive innovation, it’s only surprising that it didn’t jump on this sooner.

We have been offering hashtag targeting tools to marketers since the beginning of this year and this has provided extremely positive results for our clients so far.

The addition of hashtag recognition to Facebook will further bolster our offering and provide even more insight to brands. By targeting consumers based on their genuine real-time interests, highly relevant advertising can be delivered within milliseconds – helping to boost conversions and, ultimately, the effectiveness of online advertising as a whole.

Kudos to Facebook for recognising the power of the hashtag and the insight and data it can provide.'
