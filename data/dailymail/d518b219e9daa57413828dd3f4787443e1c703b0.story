More Australians could choose to holiday domestically after the AirAsia flight QZ8501 disaster caps off the air industry’s deadliest year in a decade, tourism experts say.

The Airbus A320-200 was 42 minutes into its flight from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore, on Sunday, when it vanished with 162 people on board.

As bodies of passengers are discovered floating in the Java sea, off the coast of Borneo Island, Australian travellers are expected to reconsider travel plans in the short term.

‘I think what will happen is the safe havens in the world, like Australia, will become more popular… so what we are likely to see is a particular move out of Asia and a much bigger focus on destinations that are very safe,’ economics and tourism expert Brian Haratsis told Daily Mail Australia. 

The doomed AirAsia flight comes after 1,050 aviation fatalities were already reported in 2014, including two Malaysia Airlines incidences.

In July, 298 passengers and crew were killed when Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine – in an area controlled by pro-Russia separatists – while it was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam.

And 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after Flight MH370, travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, veered far off course and disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March. No wreckage has been found.

Mr Harastsis, chairman of planning company MacroPlan Dimasi, said: ‘It is likely in the short run that the Australia dedication to outbound travel will change. For example, the implications of the Bali bombings in the short run saw it drop off but then it returned again.’

‘The biggest impact on travel will be on the Australian dollar but the disaster will keep more people home too,’ he explained.

Mr Harastsis predicted ‘we may have 18-24 months in Australia of more domestic travel’ and a return to families holidaying in traditional Australian beach resorts.

‘Domestic tourism on the Gold Coast has been declining over five years but now we are likely to see a return to those destinations, they are relatively inexpensive and accessible.

‘There is a perceived increase in complexity in travelling to Asia in total and that combined impact means that people look at alternative destinations.

‘Over the last few months outbound domestic travel has been dropping,’ he said.

Mr Harastsis also expects more Australians to look at holidaying in America - another place perceived as ‘safe’.

‘People may also look at holidays to the USA. Direct flights into Dallas have been very successful, so much so Qantas has put on more capacity. And LAX airport has been upgraded very significantly. Our views of the USA have changed dramatically.’

He believes that Australian flyers may return to more expensive airlines such as Qantas for perceived peace of mind.

The AirAsia disaster occurred in South East Asia, the same region where MH370 disappeared in March

‘People see it as a price for safety. For a few hundred extra dollars people will weigh it up… it’s also a question of how certain you can be of cancellations and when you can travel.

‘It’s ok for a backpacker to sleep on the floor but if you are family you can’t do that… Qantas, Emirates, Singapore airlines all might do quite well.’

However, spokesperson for Flight Centre, the largest retail travel outlet in Australia, Hadyn Long, said that unlike around the time of the MH17 and MH370 disasters they haven’t seen people cancelling flights or bookings with AirAsia since Sunday.

‘We haven't seen any changes in booking patterns and wouldn't really expect to, based on previous experiences over the years,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I think people recognise that air travel is generally very safe and I think they also recognise that Air Asia is a good airline with a good reputation.’

AirAsia currently flies into Darwin, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and the Gold Coast but recently withdraw flights to Adelaide due to cost cutting.

In August, the airline launched flights from as little as $13 in the wake of its rival Malaysia Airlines’ double disaster.

AirAsia offered sales fares from Australia to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur from $159, with onward flights from their costing as little as $13.

In the same month, Malaysia Airlines slashed its prices for long-haul routes as it struggled to hold onto customers and crew following the two air tragedies that killed hundreds of people.

The beleaguered airline offered a sale from London Heathrow Airport to Kuala Lumpur and nine other destinations in Malaysia, with return economy class flights selling for as little as £570 on select dates.

It is also offered cut-price deals to customers in Australia and New Zealand.
