John Lewis boss Andy Street has apologised for saying that in France 'nothing works and nobody cares', but the latest data seems to prove him right

While John Lewis boss Andy Street has backtracked on his claim that France is 'hopeless and downbeat', the latest economic data shows he may be right after all.

The country was branded the 'sick man of the world' yesterday after figures for September showed output fell for the fifth month in a row as businesses continued to shed jobs.

Analysts said it pointed towards another quarter of stagnation, following six months of zero growth between January and June.

John Lewis boss Andy Street was forced to apologise after saying that in France 'nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it', but some analyists have agreed with his outlook.

Chris
 Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘No longer just the sick 
man of Europe, France looks more like the sick man of the world.’

The 
‘increasingly bloated’ public sector ‘has masked the dismal performance 
of the private sector where businesses are struggling,’ he said.

Official figures show the French economy – the second largest in Europe 
behind Germany’s – is 1.2 per cent bigger than at its pre-crisis peak in
 early 2008.

But when government spending is stripped out, output is 
still 1.7 per cent below those levels.

‘France’s private sector is 
technically back in recession,’ said Mr Williamson. ‘Even other euro 
area countries are coping much better than France. Europe is being held 
back by its second-largest economy.’

Markit’s report said that 
during September, businesses axed jobs at the fastest pace for 16 
months. Unemployment in France remains stuck above 10 per cent, with 
more than three million people out of work.

As well as rising unemployment, falling inflation and stagnant growth, France is also being governed by the most unpopular leader in its history

Diego Iscaro, senior 
economist at research group IHS Global Insight, said: ‘The French 
economy is struggling. It stagnated during the first half of the year 
and the outlook is hardly better.

'Near record-high unemployment is 
keeping private consumption, the traditional engine of French growth, 
under intense pressure.

'Meanwhile, firms are reluctant to invest amid a 
backdrop of falling profitability and increasing concerns about the 
economic outlook.’

Added to the economic woes is the fact that France is currently being lead by the most unpopular leader in its history.

Several high-profile scandals, including a messy break-up with his long-term partner Valerie Trierweiler following claims of an affair with actress Julie Gayet, have badly hurt President Hollande.

The failure of his socialist party to govern effectively has also lead to the rapid rise of the far-right nationalist party, led by Marine Le Pen.

After dealing a series of heavy blows to Hollande in local elections,her party recently seized its first two seats in the country's senate.
