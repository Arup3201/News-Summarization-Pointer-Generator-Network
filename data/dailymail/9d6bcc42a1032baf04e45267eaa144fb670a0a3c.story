Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is a dream target for Inter Milan, according to general director Marco Fassone.

The Italian giants are keen to sign the 31-year-old this summer, a player Inter coach Roberto Mancini knows well having guided him from 2010 until 2013 at the Barclays Premier League club.

Gazzetta dello Sport claim Inter are prepared to submit an offer of 60million euros (Â£43million) for the Ivory Coast international, who is under contract with the Blues outfit until June 2017.

Inter general director Marco Fassone fears City's asking price and Toure's wages could be too much

'Who doesn't dream of having a player like him? Toure would give our midfield line something that we are lacking,' Fassone told Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'But his wages and City's asking price might be a big obstacle.'

Toure has scored seven goals and set up one more in 22 Premier League appearances this term for City.

Inter are also working on new deals for their Argentina forward Mauro Icardi and Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic.

Icardi is Inter's top scorer this season with 15 goals and is tied to the Nerazzurri for a further three seasons, while Kovacic, who is a reported target of Liverpool, is under contract with inter until June 2019.

Mateo Kovacic, pictured celebrating a goal against Cagliari, is also in talks over an extended deal

'We are almost there with respect to Icardi's contract extension,' Fassone said. 'We want to keep him just as we want to keep Kovacic.

'We will evaluate with great care (their) eventual offers.

'It's clear that if we want to sign three players (this summer) we will need to evaluate those that will depart.'

Inter's priority right now is to tie Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to a long-term contract.

The Slovenia international has been linked with Roma as well as Manchester United and becomes a free agent next season.

'Handanovic's renewal is an issue that we must resolve at once,' Fassone said. 'We need to understand what he wants.

'We cannot go into next season knowing that our goalkeeper's contract expires.'

Inter are currently 10th in Serie A with 10 league games remaining.
