Scampie the two-year-old white poodle got a nasty shock when he cocked his leg by a lamp post on his daily walk - and was hurled across the street metres by a blast of electricity.

The pet was being walked through Swindon, Wiltshire, by his owner Ernest Reid, 68, when he was caught out by the faulty post.

Scampie was thrown three metres by the force of the shock and had to be rescuing quivering from the street by his concerned owner, who feared his dog could have died in the accident.

Cautious: Since the shock, Owner Ernest Reid, 68, says Scampie is nervous on walks - and fears he could have died from the blast

Mr Reid, a retired electrical engineer, was walking his dog at around 10pm and says he remembers smelling burning - but did not make the connection that fried electrics in the lamp post could be to blame.

He said: 'He was walking alongside me, like he always does. He stopped at the lamp post for a wee and then he let out a yelp.

'I turned around and as I did so I saw Scampie being thrown across the path and he landed on the grass about three metres away.

'At first I assumed he had sat on a hedgehog. We get quite a lot of them around here so I thought that is what had happened.

'But then I realised he had been electrocuted'.

It is thought a burning moped had earlier been up against the pole, causing the electrical wires to fuse and short circuit.

Mr Reid continued: 'He didn't appear to have any physical injuries - but he was shaking and squealing and he would not move from the grass.

'When I shone the light onto the lamp post there was quite a lot of smoke and I could tell it had shorted.

'I took him to the vets and they said he was OK but I'm still a little worried so I am going to take him back for a check up.

'He's
 only just starting to return to his normal self, his tail is wagging 
and he is quite happy but he's still not as happy as he used to be and 
he won't go near metal lamp posts any more.

'I thought the smell was just someone burning rubbish on the allotments. I should have known but I couldn't place it.

'I didn't know what the smell was until Scampie got the shock and I suddenly remembered it was an electrical short.

Complaint: Mr Reid says he is yet to receive an apology for the council over how the lamppost was allowed to become electrified and dangerous

'On our way back from the walk I shone a torch along the lamp-posts and there was smoke coming out of them.

'He
 will only really walk on the side of the grass now. I reported it to 
the local council but I still haven't heard a word back from them - let 
alone an apology.

'If
 I had leaned against the post. I could have been killed. I have angina 
so I'm not sure I would have even been able to survive 240 volts through
 my body.

'I will be sending the council my vets bills'.

Scottish & Southern Energy said they were aware of the incident and had fixed the lamp post.

A spokesman said: 'We were called shortly after midnight on May 17 by Swindon Council and we were advised that there had been an incident involving the electrocution of a dog.

'We responded within half an hour of the report and it was made safe'.

Swindon Council has been contacted for comment.
