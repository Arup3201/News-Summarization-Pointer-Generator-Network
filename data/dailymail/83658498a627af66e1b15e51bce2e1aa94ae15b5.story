Two cousins who kidnapped a four-year-old boy from a park as parents looked on in horror have sparked outrage after admitting the incident was fake.

Jason Holden, 24, and his cousin Jesse said that they had coordinated the hoax in Sequim, Washington on Saturday afternoon with his stepmother, who allowed them to kidnap her son.

The men called the police ahead of the stunt to warn them that they were filming a YouTube video to promote 'kidnapping awareness'.

'The police never said it wasn't a good 
idea,' Holden told ABC News. 'They asked for our name and number and said they 
would notify the police in our area.'

Set up: A video posted to YouTube shows a man running from a van into a park and grabbing a four-year-old boy. The two cousins behind the video caused outrage after admitting that it was set up

Taken: He jumps into a waiting van with the young boy and they drive off - to the horror of witnesses

But authorities said they did not consider the phone call sufficient warning.

The video, which was posted to their YouTube channel, shows the men donning masks as they drive towards the park while heavy guitar music plays.

They pull alongside the park as the boy sits on the bench before one jumps out, runs towards him and picks him up - before returning to the van just seconds later.

Panicked parents scream and run after the boy as they frantically try to take note of the van's license plate number.

Afterwards 
they returned to the park to explained to the worried parents what they 
had been doing and to assure them the boy was safe - but they were met 
with anger.

'We explained that we were filming an 
awareness video for kidnapping, but everyone sat there and yelled at 
us,' said Holden. 'We werenâ€™t able to explain ourselves or apologize.'

Snatched: As parents run towards the car, the fake kidnappers, Jason and Jesse Holden, drive off

Anger: When they returned to the park, they were met with the terrified and angry parents

In trouble: They were later pulled over by a police officer who said he had been ready to shoot them

Mother Tiffany Barnett said that the explanation wasn't enough, saying: 'My daughter is still terrified. She's like, "What if they take me?"'

Police also pulled over the van after some of the parents placed 911 calls and the video shows their interaction with the police officer.

'Honestly, I was fully ready to kill whoever was in the front seat of that van,' he tells the men.

They 
explained that they had called police ahead of the incident but the 
police officer apparently had not been warned. They apologized and the 
police officer shook their hand and left.

But it may not be over for the Holden cousins, as they could be charged with misdemeanor dangerous conduct or with failing to obtain a permit, City Attorney Craig Ritchie said.

No decision had been reached as of Wednesday on whether to file charges, said Victoria Ormand, assistant to Police Chief Bill Dickinson.

Regrets: The Holdens said they felt ashamed of scaring the parents but insisted they had good intentions

Remorse: They said the video, which had been to raise awareness of the crime, was now hard to watch

Speaking on Good Morning America on Thursday, Jesse Holden added that it was tough for him to watch the video, knowing how upset it had made people.

'It's kind of hard for me to watch it,' he said. 'I feel a lot of shame... We really didn't picture it was going to have that sort of impact.'

The Sequim Police Department said they did receive a call from one of the men ahead of the hoax but that it was not the appropriate way to deal with the situation.

'We got a 
call moments before the incident happened at the park, with someone 
saying something to the effect of they are going to be filming a 
documentary-type video involving a fake kidnapping,' Sgt. Detective Sean
 Madison told ABC News. 'We don't consider that to be a warning or an 
advisement.'

Anger: Mother Tiffany Barnett said that her daughter was still scared she would be kidnapped

Sequim Police Chief Bill Dickinson added to KOMO that people had good reason to be upset.

'People are angry when they are taken advantage of,' Dickinson said. 'When they are the butt of the joke, it's never funny.'

The video, which has been viewed more than 45,000 times, has had mixed responses, with many lambasting the thoughtlessness of the men, but others have supported it.

'Thank you guys,' one wrote. 'As a father of 3 I am glad that the people that watch this video will understand how easy it would be to just pull up and grab a kid from anywhere.'
