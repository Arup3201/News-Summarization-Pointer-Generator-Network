A Florida car dealer has been arrested for attempted murder after he shot a teenage burglar who broke into his car lot.

Police say Jonas Charles, 34, cornered the 15-year-old at his South Florida business May 23 after standing guard all night with friends because of a previous break-in.

Witnesses said the teen put his hands up and begged 'please don't shoot me!'Â 

WTVJ reports that Charles opened fire and shot the teen in the abdomen.

When the boy ran, Charles fired several more shots as he gave chase, according to police.

Charles
 told police that he and friends camped out all night at JC Best Auto 
Sales on May 23 because burglars had broken in the previous night and 
stolen the keys for all of the cars on the lot.

By 2am, a group of four teens arrived in a car that had bee n stolen from the dealership the night before.

The burglars headed for a Nissan Rogue when Charles emerged.

Police say he confronted the teens and fired several shots from a handgun.

He then chased two of the burglars - a 13-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy and cornered them.

He called 911, but authorities say, he took the law into his own hands.

Charles was attempting to protect his dealership, JC Best Auto Sales, from being burglarized, he said

And the 15-year-old pleaded for his life, Charles shot him, according to police.

'You shot me bro!' the teen responded about being wounded.

Authorities say that because the teen was not armed and did not present a threat of harming Charles, he was not justified in using deadly force.

The 15-year-old, who is expected to survive his injuries, was charged with burglary.
