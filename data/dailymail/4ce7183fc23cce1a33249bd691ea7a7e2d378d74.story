The morning-after pill may not prevent pregnancies in overweight women, it emerged last night.

Fears were raised over Levonelle, Britain’s most popular emergency contraceptive, after the maker of a similar pill said theirs did not work among women over a certain weight.

Studies show that Norlevo, which contains the same key ingredient as Levonelle, is less effective among women who weigh more than 11 stone 11lb and does not work at all in women over 12 stone 8lb. The average British woman weighs around 11 stone.

Fears were raised over the top-selling UK pill Levonelle - which contains the same key ingredient as Norlevo

Norlevo is not sold in the UK but at 
least 200,000 prescriptions a year are written out for Levonelle and 
similar drugs. Many more packets are sold over the counter.

The
 drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency, stressed that women should continue to follow their doctors’ 
advice.

However, it is to review if Levonelle and other morning-after 
pills containing levonorgestrel – a synthetic version of the female sex 
hormone progesterone – need to carry a warning about weight.

The Food and Drug Administration, the US watchdog, is carrying out a review and, on the Continent, Norlevo will carry warnings.

The
 issue came to light two years ago, when an Edinburgh University study 
found that obese women were more than three times as likely as those of 
normal weight to become pregnant after taking the morning-after pill. 
The link was particularly strong for levonorgestrel-based pills.

It
 is thought that the drug may be diluted in bigger women or broken down 
more quickly by their bodies. It is also possible that the drug is 
soaked up by their fat cells, stopping it from working properly.

Weight limit: Norlevo only works well for women who weigh less than 165 pounds, the manufacturer says

Professor
 Anna Glasier, the study’s lead researcher, advised bigger women to have
 a copper coil, or IUD, fitted or take EllaOne, another morning-after 
pill containing a different chemical. It works for longer than Levonelle
 and is more effective and can be taken up to five days after 
unprotected sex.

Professor Glasier said: ‘If you can only get levonorgestrel, then if it were me, I’d take it and hope I was lucky.’

Dr
 Diana Mansour, of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, 
said that among overweight and obese women, the drug is probably 
absorbed by their fat more quickly, giving it less time to work.

Dr 
Mansour said: ‘It has less of a chance to delay ovulation and there are 
lower levels of the drug to have an effect.’ She said it wasn’t clear if
 giving bigger women a higher dose would solve the problem.

Don't use our product: The maker of Norlevo has told women weighing more than 176 pounds the pill will not work for them

The
 Family Planning Association urged concerned women to seek medical 
advice. Lynn Hearton, the FPA’s clinical spokesman, said: ‘It is 
particularly important that we don’t put some women off taking emergency
 contraception because they think it won’t work. It is always better to 
use some form of emergency contraception than none at all.’

A
 Levonelle dose consists of one tablet that should be taken within 72 
hours of unprotected sex, although it is more effective the sooner it is
 taken.

It is thought to 
prevent pregnancy by interfering with the release of eggs and disrupting
 fertilisation. It may also stop any fertilised egg from implanting in 
the womb.

Levonelle’s manufacturer, Medimpex, did not respond to requests for a comment.
