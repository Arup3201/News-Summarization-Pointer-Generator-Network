Brendan Rodgers insists Daniel Sturridge will be fit for the start of the new Premier League season – despite the Liverpool striker flying home early from the club's tour of America with a hamstring injury.

The former Chelsea frontman sat out Saturday's 2-0 victory over AC Milan in Charlotte and will miss Monday's final of the International Champions Cup against Manchester United in Miami.

Adam Lallana and Jon Flanagan have also returned to the UK due to injuries.

Back home: Daniel Sturridge has returned home from Liverpool's tour of the United States with a hamstring injury, but his manager Brendan Rodgers insists he will be fit for the start of the Premier League season

Assurance: Rodgers confirmed that Sturridge will miss the International Champions Cup final with Manchester United in Miami on Monday but said he should return in next weekend's friendly with Borussia Dortmund

'Dan has flown back,' Rodgers confirmed.

'He wasn't going to be ready for the game on Monday but there is no concern there.

'He will be ready for the game against Borussia Dortmund next weekend.

'It was just best to get him back to the training ground so he can get some treatment there. He has a really, really slight feeling in his hamstring. Nothing major.'

Goals from Joe Allen and Suso saw off the challenge of Milan in front of nearly 70,000 fans in North Carolina. Liverpool were already assured of top spot in Group B after Manchester City's defeat to Olympiacos on penalties.

'We were excellent and continues a lot of the good work that has taken place over the pre-season,' he said.

Making sure: Suso (centre) scored Liverpool's second goal against Milan to guarantee their progress

'I was delighted with the performance. A lot of the players got longer game time with a lot of young players out there.

'AC Milan have some very good players but defensively we were very strong and pressed the ball well.

'We were very hungry to get the football and some of our play was outstanding.

'What pleased me tonight was the real maturity to our game, understanding the system and understanding the style, and having that belief that we can win games. Even in pre-season creating that mentality is very important.

'We were here in this tournament to do well and we've got to the final. Now we hope to win it as well as getting our preparation right for the start of the season.'

Next up: Louis van Gaal will get an early taste of the Liverpool vs Manchester United rivalry when the two teams meet in Monday's final 

Rodgers is relishing the prospect of locking horns with Louis van Gaal's United, who won Group A after beating Real Madrid 3-1 in Michigan.

'These are top players and for top players every game is a competition,' Rodgers said.

'When you work for a club like Liverpool there are never too many friendlies.

'The game on Monday will be equally competitive. It's been a really good pre-season for us and we hope to finish it well.

'Liverpool vs Manchester United is arguably the biggest game in the world and for it to be here in the United States is great viewing for the supporters and the tournament organisers.

'They are the two biggest clubs in Britain and two of the biggest in the world. It will be a fantastic game and we are looking forward to it.

'It's more than football, it's about two cities, which aren't very far apart but have always been huge rivals.'
