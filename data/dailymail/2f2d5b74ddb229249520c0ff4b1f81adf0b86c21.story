Britain's bid to introduce a European Union ban on Iranian oil imports was scuppered yesterday by debt-stricken Greece.

Foreign Secretary William Hague had secured widespread support at an EU ministers' meeting for tough sanctions to choke off vital funds to the rogue regime in Tehran.

But Greece, whose catastrophic finances have left it teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and the Eurozone in meltdown, rejected the hardline crackdown.

Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking in the Commons earlier this 
week, promised to 'intensify' sanctions imposed on Iran

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
confirmed Athens, which relies on Iranian oil, had a 'number of 
reservations' about imposing an embargo.

'Iran sells them oil on credit which is a considerable advantage these days,' said one EU diplomat.

But ministers agreed to impose 
European travel bans and asset freezes on 180 Iranian individuals and 
firms involved in Tehran's controversial nuclear weapons programme at 
the meeting in Brussels. It doubled the number targeted to 370.

The blacklisted people and companies 
were involved with Iranian shipping lines, financial services, energy 
and transport, or those associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

And officials insisted a ban on buying
Iranian crude oil - amounting to 30million tonnes a year, or 6 per cent
of total EU imports - could be rubber-stamped as early as next month if
other oil nations could plug the gap.

A hard-hitting statement said talks 
would now focus on new measures aimed at 'severely affecting' Iran's 
banks, transport and energy production.

The 27-member EU agreed to widen the 
blacklist after a United Nations report concluded there was 'credible' 
evidence that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was still developing an 
atomic bomb.

Mr Hague had demanded tougher measures to 'increase the isolation of the regime'.

Britain was also seeking new sanctions
after a frenzied mob of hardline Iranian protesters attacked the UK 
embassy in Tehran on Tuesday.

More than 200 thugs stormed the 
mission's two compounds. Chanting 'Death to Britain', they hurled petrol
bombs,wrecked and looted diplomats' homes and offices, and set fire to 
the Union flag.

Eleven rioters were released by Iran yesterday.

Ambassadors and diplomats in Tehran 
said they were 'shocked' by the extent of damage wreaked inside 
Britain's two diplomatic compounds after visiting the premises 
yesterday.

'Everybody was shaken. People were pale, shocked by what they saw,' one Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity.

Britain's embassy, in the centre of 
Tehran, had been turned 'upside down', with paintings ripped apart and 
windows smashed, while 'everything was broken' in residences in the 
diplomatic compound in the north of the city, another said.

In both places, slogans such as 'Down with the British' were scrawled on walls and diplomatic papers were strewn about.

Rioters were furious at Britain's 
decision last week to unilaterally sever all financial links with Iran 
over its nuclear programme.

Mr Hague said the 'shameful' attack 
was carried out with the 'consent' of the regime. And he retaliated by 
kicking Iran's diplomats out of Britain and ordered the immediate 
closure of its mission in London, after pulling its own staff out of 
Tehran.

The decision reflected the icy 
relations between Britain and Iran, which are at their worst since 1989 
when the Islamic republic declared a 'fatwa' - edict - to kill author 
Salman Rushdie for supposed blasphemy.

Iran expressed regret for the attack on the UK embassy and said a number of protesters had been arrested.

But the semi-official Fars news agency
said yesterday that police had freed 11 militant students held over the
violence. There was no explanation for their release.

Jubilant radical student groups said 
they would hold a 'ceremony to thank God for the breakdown of ties 
between Tehran and London'.

EU foreign policy chief Baroness Catherine Ashton said the EU was 'outraged' by the attack.
