The skydiver and pilot who crashed mid-air this weekend described the moment they both nearly died in an interview with Good Morning America Monday morning.

Skydiver John Frost, 49, was landing at South Lakeland Airport in Florida Saturday at the same time 87-year-old pilot Sharon Trembley was touching down.

Trembley, a World War II veteran, tried to avoid Frost but the skydiver's parachute cables got tangled in the plane's propeller catching Frost and causing the small Cessna to nose dive.

Miraculously, both men escaped the crash with only minor injuries and have already been released by the hospital.

Survivors: Skydiver John Frost, 49 (left), was hit by a a small plane while landing at a Florida airport on Saturday. Both he and the pilot of the plane, 87-year-old Sharon Trembley (right) survived the crash with just minor injuries

The collision happened Saturday, just as Frost was landing from a skydive and Trembley was touching down on the runway

In an interview on GMA, Frost described the startling moment he realized he was about to be hit by an airplane.

'All of a sudden, I look over to my right and there was an aircraft coming at me. I realized that I was going to have an impact and I scrunched up and prepared for being hit,' Frost recalled.

Frost was then pulled backwards as his parachute got wrapped around the wing of Trembley's plane.

As the small aircraft wheeled around and nosedived onto the runway, Frost was launched into the air.

The collision, which took place about 75 feet in the air, was captured in a dramatic series of photos by Tim Telford, who sensed something bad was going to happen when he heard the plane coming in as the skydivers were landing.

Frost says he never imagined such a thing could happen to him, but he says the crash won't keep him from skydiving again.

'As soon as I feel safe to jump again, I'll be up there,' he said.

After the crash, Frost was left sore and bruised but escaped breaking any bones or suffering internal injuries.

Trembley was a bit more beat up after the crash - cracking his trachea.

He also needed five stitches on his chin, but has since been released from the hospital as well.

In an interview with WTVT after being released, Trembley said neither he or Frost would be alive today if it weren't for his fast thinking.

'I pulled back on the stick to make the airplane go up and not him him. If I hadn't have thought fast enough myself, he would've been dead,' Trembley said.

Both the NTSB and FAA are investigating the crash.
