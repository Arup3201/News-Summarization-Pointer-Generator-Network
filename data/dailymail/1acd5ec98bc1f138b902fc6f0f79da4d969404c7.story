World Cup runners-up New Zealand have had five players named in the International Cricket Council's team of the tournament.

Black Caps captain Brendon McCullum has been chosen as skipper of the side with fellow opener Martin Guptill, all-rounders Corey Anderson and Daniel Vettori and fast bowler Trent Boult also representing the beaten finalists.

McCullum scored 328 runs in nine World Cup matches with four half-centuries at a strike-rate of 188.50, while Guptill was the tournament's highest run-scorer with 547 including a stunning World Cup record 237 not out against the West Indies in the quarter-finals.

Martin Guptill (New Zealand), Brendon McCullum (New Zealand, captain), Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka, wicketkeeper), Steve Smith (Australia), AB de Villiers (South Africa), Glenn Maxwell (Australia), Corey Anderson (New Zealand), Daniel Vettori (New Zealand), Mitchell Starc (Australia), Trent Boult (New Zealand), Morne Morkel (South Africa), Brendan Taylor (Zimbabwe) (12th man)

Champions Australia were also well represented with Mitchell Starc, who was joint highest wicket-taker alongside Boult with 22, Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell all selected.

South Africans AB de Villiers and Morne Morkel complete the side along with Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara while Brendan Taylor of Zimbabwe is 12th man.

'There were a number of other players that were discussed as possible selections in the team,' said Geoff Allardice, chairman of the selection panel.

'These included batsmen Mahmudullah (Bangladesh) and Shaiman Anwar (UAE), fast bowlers Umesh Yadav, Mohammad Shami (both India), Wahab Riaz (Pakistan) and spinners Imran Tahir (South Africa) and R.Ashwin (India).

'But there were so many brilliant individual performances during the tournament that it was not possible to fit them into the team. The panel eventually came up with this side, which, in their view, was the most balanced outfit that is capable of beating any side on any given day.'Â
