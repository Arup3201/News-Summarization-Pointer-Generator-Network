John Terry placed the ball on the spot, smacked it past Mark Schwarzer into the top corner and his whoop of delight cut through the leafy tranquility of the Surrey stockbroker belt where Chelsea train.

This time last week, Terry feared his season might be over, cut short by a twisted ankle during the  goalless first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid.

On Tuesday, he was declared fit by Jose Mourinho, but the manager did not stop there. He also told how his captain had unfinished business in this competition and declared his form to be as good as ever.

In return, Terry ruled out the notion of an England return and pledged his future to Chelsea beyond the end of a contract which is about to run out.

‘It’s the club I’ve been at since 14, and I’ve been nowhere else,’ said the 33-year-old centre half. ‘I want to stay here for the rest of my footballing days. We’re in talks.

‘We’ve had big games, so we haven’t spoken for a few weeks, but I hope it gets done. It’s down to the club but I want to stay and I hope something gets sorted out.’

He credits Mourinho with reviving a career which was drifting last  season, when injuries, suspensions and the tactical preferences of Rafa Benitez combined to leave him a peripheral figure at the club he joined from school.

‘A lot of people in football ruled me out a bit last year, thinking I wouldn’t be here for too much longer,’ said Terry. ‘That spurs you on to do well and battle for the club you love. Whether that’s a year, two years, three years, I feel I have something to give next year. Beyond that, we don’t know. I hope so.

'The manager has played a massive part for me. We spoke in the summer once his deal was done. He’s very honest. He lets you know straight. If you’re not good enough, you won’t play. If you’re playing well, you keep your place.’

The feeling is mutual. It was Mourinho who brought up Terry’s horrible histories in European finals — a missed penalty in 2008 in  Moscow, suspension four years later in Munich and an injury last year which ruled him out of the Europa League final in Amsterdam — and suggested it was time for the Champions League to repay him.

‘My captain is playing at the same level he was playing when I left Chelsea in 2007, as simple as that,’ said Mourinho. ‘Seven years later, he’s playing again at his best.

‘It’s also fair to say that the  people who surround him, the  people playing on his left and right, in front of him, are also playing  fantastically. His partnership with Gary Cahill is fantastic.

‘I’m really happy to see a player like him, six or seven years later, to be back to the same level. He deserves more than the Champions League has given him up to now.

Gatecrasher: Injury kept Terry out of the 2012 final, although he donned his kit for the celebrations

‘He lost a few semi-finals in special circumstances. He lost a final also in special circumstances. He won a final in special  circumstances because he couldn’t play. I think the Champions League owes him something.’

Terry, sitting beside his manager, welled up slightly. He said for many years he kept the shirt from the Moscow final on the wall in his home and used it as motivation but it has been in storage since he sold his mansion.

‘When we won it I took it down,’ he said. ‘It went into the loft and another one replaced it. Disappointing memories, but when you go on to win it, happy memories tend to outweigh those.’

As for the Munich final, in 2012, when he was ridiculed for pulling on his kit to join in the post-match celebrations, he was also able to laugh.

‘It did mean a lot to me that night, playing or not playing,’ said Terry. ‘I felt I contributed. So did other players who didn’t get as much stick as me. That’s a different story.

In good hands: There were fears Terry would not play again this season after limping out of the first game

‘Throughout that campaign, I had surgery on my knee before the Napoli game and came back really quickly, scored a goal and played a part. I did have a big part to play in the dressing room and on the field of play as well.

‘Those winning moments live with you, those moments when you get your hands on the trophy, particularly when you’re in a difficult period personally and professionally. Those memories tend to spur you on.’

He underwent intensive  treatment through the week to get himself in shape to lead the team out against Atletico in tonight’s second leg and is ready to take a penalty if the game goes that way.

It very well might. Neither of these sides concedes often. It will be tense and nervous; a clash of teams who prefer to be without the ball, anxious not to make the first slip. Who has the biggest bus?

Atletico, with Chelsea’s on-loan goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois set to make his debut at Stamford Bridge, have not conceded in six games. Neymar was the last man to beat Courtois when he equalised for Barcelona in the first leg of the quarter-final on April 1. Chelsea have kept five clean sheets out of the last six.

‘I hope I can guarantee the home fans a win,’ said Terry. ‘I can’t promise an attractive one. The most important thing is to win. As a footballer, there’s no better feeling.’

It was no surprise to see the  Chelsea players practising from 12 yards but they will be without  No 1 goalkeeper Petr Cech, despite a game of bluff yesterday.

Cech, who dislocated a shoulder in the first leg last week, trotted out for training, smiling and  claiming he was fit, but as he limbered up it soon became clear he was not and he went off to work alone. Mark Schwarzer will  continue in goal, but Mourinho has Samuel Eto’o, Eden Hazard and Terry fit after injury.
