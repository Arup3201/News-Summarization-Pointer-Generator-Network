As Luis Suarez waits to find out if he has a future in football, rival players in Brazil are continuing to mock his alleged bite on the shoulder of an Italian defender.

Even Giorgio Chiellini, the Italian involved in the clash with Suarez, poked fun at the incident which happened as Uruguay knocked his team out of the World Cup.

The grinning Juventus centre-back posted a picture of a hotel maid biting his shoulder, in much the same way as Suarez appeared to on Tuesday night.

Elsewhere, Brazil striker Fred was snapped pretending to bite teammate Marcelo's arm in training, and Hollywood comedian Will Ferrell turned up at a Recife bar where American fans were gathered and promised then he would bite 'every German player' if USA's next game is a close call.

Left-wing magazine the New Statesman, 
meanwhile, calculated that top-flight footballers are more likely to be 
bitten by Luis Suarez than by a shark.

Using rough calculations, the magazine's Future Proof blogger
 Ian Steadman found that players have about a one in 2,000 chance of the
 Liverpool ace trying to take a chunk out of them, while there is only a
 one in 3.7million chance of being bitten by a shark in the ocean.

Suarez's clash with Giorgio Chiellini prompted a huge spike in Twitter mentions of the Uruguay wonder boy.

The
 social messaging site told MailOnline that prior to the bite, there 
about 100,000 mentions relating to @Luis16Suarez on Tuesday.

After the incident there was a massive two million mentions of Suarez by 10pm Tuesday night.

Twitter's data showed how most of the mentions occured in Western Europe and 
the U.S., the biggest Twitter-using regions, followed by Suarez's own 
regional neighbourhood of southern South America.

The
 also football-mad region of Central America also showed massive 
interest, as would be expected, but there were also notable spikes in 
Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Nigeria and South Africa.

Twitter also revealed that the most 
retweeted Suarez tweet showed him wearing a collar of the kind given to 
pets by vets to stop them chewing at their own wounds, which was shared 
more than 21,000 times.

Tweets
 by the comedian Russell Brand mocking the player and NFL Picks 
reporting how one man cashed in by correctly betting Suarez would bite 
someone during the tournament were also widely shared.

But while his footballing peers and 
fans of the beautiful game can see the funny side, Suarez is no doubt anxious as 
FIFA's disciplinary hearing over the issue reconvenes in Rio de Janeiro 
this morning.

He is also 
facing the loss of lucrative sponsorship deals. The official statements 
from his sponsors were anodyne, but Sportsmail has reported 
rumours that the striker could be jettisoned.

Suarez
 is sponsored by adidas and executives from the sportswear manufacturer 
met in Rio last night to discuss the latest incident.

An
 adidas spokesman said: ‘adidas is aware of the issue involving Luis 
Suarez. We await FIFA’s full investigation into this matter and will 
respond accordingly.’

Gambling
 company 888poker have Suarez as a brand ambassador and said: ‘Following
 recent allegations made against Luis Suarez, we are reviewing our 
relationship with him. We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’

Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez 
emerged from the Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio de Janeiro shortly after
 midnight local time to say the hearing would continue on Thursday.

Valdez
 said: 'We know they met for a long time but we don't know if that means
 a good or a bad situation. They will continue in the morning.'

Suarez's
 lawyer Alejandro Balbi, who is also a Uruguay FA board member travelled
 to Rio to defend the Liverpool striker and claimed there is a European 
campaign against him led by England and Italy.

An
 outcome is expected well ahead of Uruguay's match with Italy on 
Saturday and Suarez's sponsors are keeping a close eye 
on the verdict.

Stage 3: Suarez appears to clamp his jaws down and bite Chiellini's shoulder

The video evidence appears damning and one senior FIFA official with experience of disciplinary cases, who asked to remain anonymous, believes the biting should be judged to be at least as serious as spitting, which carries a minimum six-game ban which would see Suarez's World Cup brought to an abrupt halt.

However there are influential voices who are trying to bring pressure to bear for the player to be dealt with more leniently. According to Uruguay newspaper Subrayado, the most powerful figures in South American football gathered in the Copacabana Palace to try to secure a much less severe sanction.

These included Argentina's long-standing vice-president Julio Grondona who is second only to Sepp Blatter in the pecking order, the president of CONMEBOL Eugenio Figueredo and his predecessor, Nicolas Leoz, who are both Uruguayan.

The independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, has a range of sanctions available up to 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all football. A worldwide ban would impact on his playing for Liverpool but there is no precedent for such a sanction happening.

Trouble ahead: FIFA will continue to discuss disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez on Thursday

It remains unclear whether Suarez's 
previous biting bans - 10 games for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic 
and seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal - would be 
taken into consideration, but the panel do have that power if they wish.

A
 FIFA spokeswoman said: 'They can take in all elements they deem 
necessary.' Suarez has not appeared in person at the disciplinary 
hearing.

There are also reports that the Uruguay FA are claiming pictures of teeth-marks on Chiellini's shoulder were digitally altered.
