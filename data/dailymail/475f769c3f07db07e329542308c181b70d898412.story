US president Barack Obama has condemned the international community for failing to do enough to counter the global Ebola threat. 

Obama was speaking after a meeting in Washington with allied military leaders to discus the threat posed by ISIS and Islamic militants. 

The President said 'the world is not doing enough' to counter the threat posed by Ebola.

Obama has authorised additional spending to battle the virus which is spreading rapidly in West Africa 

Medics in west Africa are trying to isolate suspected Ebola cases to prevent the spread of the disease 

The president also offered thoughts and prayers to a Dallas nurse being treated for Ebola after she helped care for a Liberian man who died from the disease. Obama says he wants lessons learned from that case to be applied to hospitals around the country.

Since the president's announcement, a second nurse who treated US Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan has been diagnosed with the disease.  

It is understood that Obama will seek additional funds from congress to battle the disease. 

So far, the US has committed more than $1 billion in federal funds. Congress is expected to consider proposals to increase the aid effort once it reconvenes next month. 

White House Budget Director Shaun Donovan said: 'Our expectation is that we will be talking to Congress about additional needs.'

Among the money already committed, $30 million has been promised to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Also, an additional $750 million has been allocated to the Defense Department to support military efforts in countering Ebola. 

The Pentagon  had asked Congress to move $1 billion earmarked for war fighting to counter Ebola.

US troops are set to be deployed in West Africa to support civil authorities in countering the deadly outbreak.

In a bid to secure a global response to the Ebola crisis, President Obama will host a video conference with world leaders to discuss the outbreak. Other items on the agenda include ISIS and the situation in Ukraine. 

It is understood that an estimated 4,200 people have been infected by the disease according to the CDC
