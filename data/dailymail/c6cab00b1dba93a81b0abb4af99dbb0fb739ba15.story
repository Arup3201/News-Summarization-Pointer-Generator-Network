Richard Dunne looked down and out when he was released by Aston Villa 18 months ago.

At 33, he was considered over the hill and was facing the stark reality of rapidly tumbling down the Football League.

In 2009, he warranted a £5million fee moving from Manchester City to Villa but in his final season there he failed to play a single game for the club and was deemed surplus to requirements.

Richard Dunne rolled back the years with an almost unbeatable performance against Burnley

18 months ago, Dunne was down and out, but he looked at home in the Premier League on Saturday

But the centre-back rolled back the years in Queens Park Rangers’ win against Burnley on Saturday, where he was virtually unbeatable.

Dunne was big, strong and battling.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp said: ‘I took him on a free last year when nobody wanted him. He was out of work basically, hadn’t played a game for Villa the year before. We took a gamble with him and he’s been amazing.

‘In the Championship play-off final at Wembley, every time the ball came in the box he was heading or kicking it away. And again on Saturday. Since I brought him back in the side his performances have been fantastic.’

The players who scored the goals at the other end draw the obvious plaudits. Leroy Fer broke the deadlock with a deflected shot and Charlie Austin sealed the win on 74 minutes against his old club with a low strike.
