British teenager Ali Kalantar, 19, known as Ali al-Farsi, has reportedly been killed in Iraq fighting for the Islamic State

Twin sisters who fled Britain to join the Islamic State terror group in Syria have lost their jihadi fighter husbands in battle.

Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, from Manchester, left their family almost a year ago to join IS in its stronghold of Raqqa.

They married two young IS jihadis about two months ago, according to their own postings on social media. Zahra wed a British jihadi called Ali Kalantar, 19, from Coventry, and Salma married a young Afghan.

Both men were killed in the same battle last week, according to tweets Zahra sent yesterday.

She said: ‘May Allah swt accept my husband @AliAlfarsiii who got his shahadah [martyrdom] in Iraq. Two days ago.’

She then tweeted that her twin’s husband had been killed at ‘the same time’.

When The Mail on Sunday contacted Ibrahim Halane, 52, the taxi driver father of the girls, he said: ‘I haven’t heard of this. I am not talking to a newspaper, thank you.’  

Kalantar, who was said to have been 'brainwashed' by a local imam in less than one month, left the UK in March while studying for his A-levels.

He left Coventry with two friends, including 18-year-old Mohammed Hadi, who has since been dubbed Osama Bin Bieber due to his youthful looks.

His death takes the toll of Britons killed fighting in Iraq and Syria to 32. 

Since leaving the UK, Kalantar has been vocal on his Twitter account @AliAlFarsiii.

His bio reads: 'You only die once so why dont you make it martyr?'

Kalantar also previously used the now suspended Twitter handle @KafirsNightmare, on which he posted photos of Syrian children dressed in military uniform, holding his AK-47. 

Last month, he had written on his Twitter: 'Why don't these suger coated mozlems understand that Islam was also spread by sword not flowers & perfumes?'

And in an earlier post, he added: 'Jihad is the cure for all diseases #FACT'.

On his Facebook page, Kalantar had also described how he had no intention of returning to the UK, despite members of his family travelling to Turkey to try and find him. 

He wrote: 'Just to proof (sic) how much I want to come back to US, soon you would see a video of me burning my passport which has less value then my toilet tissue paper'. 

Earlier this year, Kalantar's father, who is of Afghan origin, described how he believed his son had been radicalised by an imam at a small mosque who sent him 'down this road'.  

The teenager - who had previously wanted to be a model - had only been attending the mosque for a month before being 'brainwashed' to fight overseas, his family said.

Rahim Kalantar told the BBC that he worried about his son 'every minute' and that his grief is 'limitless'.

Ali was taking his A-levels and planning to study computer science at Coventry University when he left home in March with Rashid Amani and Mohammed Hadi. He was 18 at the time.

According to his father, he asked for his passport for university paperwork and borrowed £1,000 to buy a computer. Infact, he used the money to buy a plane ticket and left for Syria.  

Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the Institute Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said Kalantar travelled from Coventry, via Birmingham and Frankfurt, before reaching Turkey.

He then crossed over the Turkish-Syrian border and joined fighters in Aleppo. 

Police were alerted to the boys' disappearance just minutes after the flight took off, but, by then, it was too late.  

Ali's sister - who did not want to be named - previously told the Coventry Telegraph: 'One day he decided to go and was soon going to prayers five times a day.  

'He changed, but we never dreamed he was being radicalised. The imam groomed him, that's the word to describe it.

'Apparently he was constantly telling these boys that they should go overseas to fight jihad.' 

His death has not been independently verified. His family could not be contacted.  

The news was announced on Twitter by Kalatar's wife in Syria, known as Umm Jafar al-Britaniyah

His wife, also a British national, later posted this photo on Twitter in memory of her husband

Kalantar's family came to the UK from Afghanistan in 2005 and settled in Coventry, living in a three-bedroom detached home.

The news of his death was announced on Twitter by his wife in Syria. Soon after, another user warned her about spreading the information online.

She later removed the tweets and set her profile to private. 

Zahra and Salma Halane had 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college. They were said to have been radicalised over the internet.

Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success.

The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. 

Mr Maher said Salma Halane also lost her husband in battle on the same day as Kalantar was killed.

Meanwhile, Mohammed Hadi has posted pictures of himself in desert combat gear armed with twin pistols, saying that he was fighting with ISIS.

According to Hadi's mother, he had no means of paying for transport to the Syrian border with his £14 per week pocket money - and she believes religious leaders may have funded his journey 

Speaking about reports of Kalantar's death, an FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of social media reports of the death of a British national in Iraq.

'The difficulty of collecting information in a conflict zone, in particular when individuals have often deliberately chosen to disguise their intentions and their identity, means that HMG has no means of reliably assembling this information.'

In the last three years, more than 500 radicalised Britons are believed to have headed out to Syria, where Islamist groups are fighting President Bashar Assad's forces.

But it is believed some of those who signed up to fight have now contacted authorities in Britain saying they have had enough of the war-zone and want to return home.

As many as a fifth of British fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation, experts warn. 

They say less-hardened jihadists could be used to show would-be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by ISIS propaganda
