Authorities in Texas have shut down Kanye West's attempt to project his controversial new video on the walls of the The Alamo - and slammed the rapper as being 'disrespectful.'

The incident came just days after the same thing happened at a Houston venue.

More than 500 fans turned up on Sunday night to see the video 'New Slaves' after the event at the historic site was advertised on his official website.

But officials said no permit had been issued for the video projection and the event in San Antonio did not take place.

Canceled: More than 500 Kanye West fans showed up at The Alamo to watch the video for 'New Slaves' before it was shut down by police

'Disrespectful': Caretakers of historic site The Alamo, San Antonio, deemed Kanye West's planned projection of his new music video New Slaves as disrespectful and shut it down on Sunday night

A controversial historical site: The Alamo, in San Antonio, Texas, was once a Roman Catholic mission before the famous battle of the Texas War of Independence in 1836

This marks the second time that Kanye's guerrilla-style promotion campaign has been vetoed by authorities: on Friday, his planned projection onto the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas, was shut down by local police.

To make matters worse for the Clique singer, the very same planned projections were reportedly cancelled due to technical difficulties at both the Central Library and Bush Memorial.

'We were never asked, and we were never told what was going to happen' said Mark Loeffler, spokesperson for the Texas General Land Office, the Alamo’s caretaker.

'It’s sad that people have such little respect for the Alamo.'

West has been debuting his video across the country on the side of buildings as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign ahead of his new album titled Yeezus.

It's not really working out: Kanye West had been on a mission to promote his new single via guerrilla-style projections in various cities, but this is the second time his project has been shut down by authorities

A link on his website directed fans to a screening at a San Antonio Mall and The Alamo.

Police moved fans on from the Mall, and also told those gathered at the Alamo there would be no showings.

A small number of member of the Texas National Movement gathered to protest the attempt to beam the video on the Alamo’s facade.

'It’s very disrespectful to the people who died here,' TNM member Angie Alexander said.

Fans said the projection wouldn’t be disrespectful of the Alamo defenders.

'It’s not vandalism,' Michael Gomez said. 'It’s just an image that’s going to power off and then it’s gone.'

Kanye is not the first music personality to stir up controversy at the Alamo.

Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne was arrested in 1982 for urinating on a memorial across the street from the fort while wearing his future wife Sharon's dress.

As a result of his antics, Osbourne was banned from San Antonio for 10 years.

The Alamo is considered one of America's most historic sites. It was the scene of a pivotal 1836 battle in the Texas Revolution as the state fought the Mexican army.

The 13-day assault on the legendary fort was led by Mexican commander Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

Among those who died in the battle were Jim Bowie, creator of the Bowie knife, and legendary frontiersman Davy Crockett.

About a month after the bloody siege at the Alamo, Texan troops took on Santa Anna's troops in the Battle of San Jacinto. Easily won for Texas, the battle had many Texan soldiers shouting the battle cry, 'remember the Alamo!'

The defense of the Alamo in 1836 by 200 men is immortalized in the film starring John Wayne as Crockett.
