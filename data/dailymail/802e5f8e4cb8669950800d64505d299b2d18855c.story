A Rockland County 
judge today found four suburban New York boys aged 12 and 13 guilty of 
raping a 14-year-old girl and trying to rape another 12-year-old girl.

Judge
Sheri Eisenpress convicted the boys in the family court after an almost
month-long trial which included testimonies from the girls, two of the 
girl's friends and incriminating statements made by the boys to police.

'You
hurt those girls. You violated them, you caused them humiliation in a 
very public way. You hurt their family. You hurt your parents,' said 
Judge Sherri Eisenpress as she found the one 12 and three 13-year-old 
boys guilty.

Two of the four boys aged between 12 and 
13-years-old found guilty of raping a 14-year-old girl arrive at 
Rockland Family court today

Although the boys were not tried as 
adults, they will be sentenced to imprisonment in youth facilities in 
New York on October 11 and will remain under house detention until then.

'These
were violent, heinous offenses that no person, let alone a child, 
should have to suffer,' said Ramapo police Lt. Mark Emma.

'There's going to be emotional issues for them for years to come.'

The
four boys are all students at Chestnut Ridge Middle School and 
conducted the attacks on the two girls from the 11th to 13th of June.

The other two boys arrived at court this morning. They will be sentenced on October 11th

The boys all made statements to the 
police that they forced their way into the girl's home using a spare key
and that they forced themselves on the girls by holding them down.

'I
don't say, nor do I think that you are bad kids, or that you're going 
to grow up to be bad adults. But you made some really, really bad 
choices,' said Judge Eisenpress.

Yesterday,
the 12-year-old New York boy and his three 13-year-old friends accused 
of gang raping a 14-year-old girl over three days and attempting to rape
another 12-year-old claimed in court that the sex was consensual.

The
boys, all students of Chestnut Ridge Middle School in Ramapo, told the 
Rockland Family Court that they did not illegally enter the girls home 
and rape her on two different occasions and sexually attack another 
girl.

Giving evidence 
by closed circuit television to the court, the girl who is now 15, said 
that on the second day the boys let themselves into her home uninvited 
early on June 12th and took it in turns to rape her - only leaving that 
morning to catch a bus to school for an exam they didn't want to miss.

In late August, the 15-year-old
girl gave evidence from another room in the family court because 
prosecution psychologists had deemed it damaging for her to see the four
defendants who are currently free under house supervision.

The
teen claimed in evidence that the boys raped her again in the afternoon
on the 12th and and finally returned on the 13th of June to rape her 
again but she told them she was menstruating and instead the boys 
attempted to attack a 12-year-old girl who was present in the home.

The
older girl said that the attacks began on the morning of June 11th, 
when the boys entered the home, held her down and stripped her of her 
clothes, which she said she tried to resist.

'I was yelling and screaming to leave me alone,' she said, adding she felt 'pain' at being penetrated multiple times.

The 15-year-old claimed that in the afternoon of the
12th after they returned from school, the boys discovered her hiding in her parents 
bedroom, overpowered her and held her down by her wrists while they took
it in turns to rape her again.

Claiming that the boys knew where a key 
to her front door was kept, the 15-year-old girl testified that the 
boys came back on the 12th and took it in turns to rape and sodomise her
inside the bathroom.

The 15-year-old and 12-year-old girl who is now 13, didn’t tell their parents until a two days 
after the alleged attacks.

In her testimony to the family 
court, the younger girl said that she kicked and screamed and bit two of
the four boys as they tried to rape her on June 13th.

'They
pulled me into (the other girl’s) room. I was screaming, ‘Get off of 
me!’', the girl told Rockland Family Court Judge Sherri Eisenpress 
according to The Journal News.

The girl said that she sat herself on the floor and grabbed her knees as the boys tried to pull off her pants.

She said that the 12-year-old boy specifically attempted to sexually assault her and that she bit him.

'I bit him very hard and he started bleeding,' said the girl to the court in her testimony in late August.

The 13-year-old said that, on June 12, she heard the older girl screaming as the four boys attacked her during the morning.

She
told the court that she and another girl who was also in the house but 
not apparently attacked tried to break into the parent's bedroom by 
ramming in the doors and picking the locks with a kitchen knife.

She
added the boys were leaning against the doors on the other side, where 
the older girl has testified the boys held her down and took turns 
sodomising her.

'I heard her screaming, ‘Stop, get off of me!’ the younger girl testified in late August

'I banged on the door. I tried even harder to push open the door.'

Ramapo is on the border of New Jersey and New York state and is where the boys all lived and attended school

Defense lawyers for the four 
boys asked why she didn’t tell or call her parents or the police if she 
thought the older girl was being raped on June 12th.

She replied she wasn’t sure what was happening to the older girl, but was too scared and embarrassed to call adults.

She
also added that she was scared her parents would get into trouble if 
police arrived and found the girls unsupervised at home alone.

And
today the 12-year-old told the court that he swore on 'everything I 
love' that he did not rape the older girl claiming that she consented.

The
boy admitted they were not invited into the house but knew where the 
family left a spare key and went to look for the older girl on June 12.

'We had sexual contact with her the day before (June 11) and wanted to do it again,' said the boy.

He
said that he attempted to have sex with the older girl on June 12th 
because he didn't want to be the only boy who had not had sex with her.

'I didn’t want to be a punk,' he said.

'I didn’t want to seem like anyone who didn’t do it. It was consensual. I swear on everything I love. She was even laughing.'

However, he admitted it was wrong hold down the younger girl, then aged 12.

She bit him while another boy held her wrists and two tried taking off her pants.

The
boy also said that boys didn't believe the older girl when she said she
was menstruating and that they argued about this for some time.

'She didn’t want to do something that day,' he said according to the Journal News.

Attorneys for the boys say they were invited into the house and, at 
one point, on the first day, one boy lay in bed with the older girl and watched television.

They also questioned why the 
girls made Facebook comments about the boys after the alleged 
sexual attacks.

The boys are currently held under home detention.

If found guilty, the older boys could be held in a juvenile detention center for three years, depending on their behavior.
