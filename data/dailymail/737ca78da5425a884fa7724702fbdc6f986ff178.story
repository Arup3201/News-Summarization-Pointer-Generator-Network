Mia Farrow's brother has pleaded guilty to two counts of sexually abusing two young boys, but also claimed his innocence as he entered an Alford plea in court on Friday.

Businessman John Villers-Farrow made the plea at his hearing in Maryland's Annapolis court as a way to reduce his sentence while asserting that he was innocent.

The father was accused of 39 counts of abusing two boys, who lived near his home, over a five-year period.

Villers-Farrow, told the court he 
entered the plea because it was the quickest way he could serve time and
get home to his wife, Sandra Hall, according to the Capital Gazette.

He 
now faces up to ten years in prison when sentenced later this year.

If found guilty on all 39 
counts he could have been sentenced to 50 years, according to NBC 
Washington.

Under the plea he is able to assert his innocence while admitting that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict him.

The
plea was first used in the Supreme Court in 1970, when Henry Alford 
argued that he had admitted to murder to avoid being given the death 
sentence, which was mandatory in cases where the defendant had been convicted 
after pleading not guilty.

The Supreme Court ruled that a defendant could plead guilty while maintaining their innocence, to secure a plea deal.

The Capital Gazette reported that, according to the statement of facts, the first alleged victim moved near to Villers-Farrow’s home when he was six-years-old, and came to know the family, whose son was a few years younger than him.

It was alleged that the victim spent a lot of time at the family's home and that Villers-Farrow would buy him gifts, take him to baseball games and on other trips.

Prosecutors allege that he began sexually abusing the boy regularly, between the ages of 9 and 16.

In the same time period, it is claimed that a second boy who was friends with the first victim, was abused about a dozen times over five years, Deputy State Attorney Kathleen Rogers said.

Mrs Hall, who is standing by her husband, has called the two alleged victims, who are now aged 20, 'vipers'.

The defense argued that Villers-Farrow, who traveled to India with his sisters Mia and Prudence in 1968 to meet the Maharishi with The Beatles, was generous to many children in the neighborhood.

His famous sister has not commented about the case involving her brother.

When the charges were first made, NBC Washington noted it was not the first time Villers-Farrow had been in the public eye. In 1992, 
he famously told PEOPLE magazine that Woody Allen, who had 
once been married to Farrow and fathered three of their children, would 
have serious legal trouble because of his relationship with her adopted 
daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.

Villers-Farrow
said: ‘[He’s] going to be indicted, and he’s going to be ruined. I 
think when all of it comes out, he’s going to jail.’

Allen,
famous for his self-deprecating and neurotic on-film persona, began a 
romantic relationship with Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 
years his junior.

Following
the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Allen’s possession, Farrow 
split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three 
children, Satchel, Dylan, and Moses.

During
the proceedings, which were closely followed, Farrow claimed that Allen
had sexually abused Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims 
because they were not substantiated.

Farrow
was awarded full custody, and Allen was denied visits with Dylan, who 
later changed her name to Malone. The couple's other adopted child, 
Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Allen at all.

In Villers-Farrow's case, the alleged victims claimed that the abuse happened during sleepovers at his home in Edgewater.

In
the opening statement of the trial on Thursday, the court was told that
the first alleged victim looked up to Villers-Farrow and spent four 
months living with him after being physically abused by his own father.

According to the Capital Gazette,
when the accusations were first made in August last year, investigators
asked one of the alleged victims to call Villers-Farrow.

During
the conversation, which was recorded without Villers-Farrow's 
knowledge, prosecutors alleged he did not deny sexually abusing the boy.

The defense however, argued that Villers-Farrow had never been left alone with the boys, and that one of them had solicited their alleged abuser for money.

The allegations were made when Villers-Farrow refused to pay, his defense lawyer said.

After he entered the Alford plea, Judge Laura S. Kiessling revoked Villers-Farrow’s bond. He will remain in jail until his sentencing in September.
