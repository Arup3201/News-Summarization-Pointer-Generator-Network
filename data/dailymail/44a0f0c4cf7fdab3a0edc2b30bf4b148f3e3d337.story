The board of trustees for University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity has admitted that the racist chant that shocked the nation had been circulating among the brothers for three to four years before it surfaced last weekend on social media.

The alumni who oversaw the disgraced chapter of SAE issued a statement on Wednesday calling the song a 'horrible cancer' and apologized for not stamping it out when it emerged years ago.

The statement confirms reports that the 'there will never be a n***** SAE' chant heard aboard a chartered fraternity bus last weekend had been passed down between generations of new pledges. 

The national SAE headquarters has denied that the song is part of the fraternity's tradition, though officials said they are investigating claims of racism at other chapters across the country. 

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was closed down on Monday and fraternity members forced to moved out

A popular statue on the OU campus was adorned with a protest from the group that leaked the racist SAE video. The statue 'Sower' had its mouth taped over with the word 'unheard'

On Tuesday, the president of the University of Texas announced he had launched an investigation into reports that the song had been used by members of the SAE fraternity there, as well. 

The trustees also intimated that current and former members of the fraternity were being harassed and threatened and called for 'all parties to begin the healing process.'

'The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped,' the statement said.

'It should have been. We are sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused and would ask for your forgiveness. We are truly sorry.'

On Monday, the University of Oklahoma shut down the SAE chapter on its campus and closed down the house. On Tuesday, President David Boren expelled the two students at the center of the racist chant.

The video that emerged on social media on Sunday was taken aboard a chartered bus with members of SAE and the sorority Delta Delta Delta. 

The shocking racist song has been circulating the SAE fraternity at OU for at least three years, trustees said 

It included two brothers - 19-year-old Parker Rice and 20-year-old Levi Pettit - leading other fraternity members in singing 'there will never be a n***** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** SAE.' 

The members of the board of trustees for the fraternity were not identified in the statement.  OU spokesman Corbin Wallace told Daily Mail Online fraternity trustee boards are typically made up of alumni and that they oversee the administration and finances of the fraternity houses. 

A request for comment from the SAE headquarters in Evanston, Illinois, was not immediately returned.  

The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped. It should have been.

We are sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused and would ask for your forgiveness. We are truly sorry. 

For the safety of the students that were involved and the students who were not involved, our desire would be for all parties to begin the healing process. 

We hope that this despicable situation will forever change an atmosphere that would even allow an incident like this to take place.
