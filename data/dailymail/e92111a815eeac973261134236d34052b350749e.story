Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has accepted a £5,000 donation from his millionaire investment banker father, triggering speculation that the party’s pool of benefactors is dwindling.

According to the latest Register of Members’ Financial Interests, published last week, the money was given to Clegg to support him in his ‘capacity as an MP’.

The gift initially caused confusion in Westminster because Clegg’s father is also called Nicholas, prompting jokes that the Deputy Prime Minister had made the donation to himself.

Nicholas Clegg Snr, 78, made his money through merchant banking and was most recently chairman of the United Trust Bank, of which he remains a non-executive director.

He is the son of a Russian-born baroness and was made a CBE in 2009 for services to ‘UK-Japanese relations’. 

His gift, received on August 8, is the second time he is known to have pledged money to the party. He previously gave £3,000 in December 2008, say Electoral Commission records.

Last month, the Deputy Prime Minister was given £5,000 by Muhammad Zahur, described by a party spokesman as a ‘Sheffield businessman’.

Figures released last month by the Electoral Commission reveal the relatively fragile state of the Lib Dems’ finances.

For the first time ever, Ukip, which has no MPs, raised more money in donations than the Lib Dems during the second quarter of 2014.

Nigel Farage’s party accepted £1.4 million of donations – £170,000 more than the Lib Dems. 

The Coalition party’s income has also been hit by its declining membership, which has fallen by more than 30 per cent since 2010 to about 44,000.

The gift, from Nicholas Clegg, initially caused confusion in Westminster, with MPs joking that the Deputy Prime Minister, pictured with his wife Miriam. had made the donation to himself

The Lib Dems’ finances are in stark contrast to those of Clegg Jnr, who comes from one of the wealthiest families of any Westminster MP. 

He and his wife, Miriam, live in a large property in Putney, South-West London, thought to be worth at least £2 million – meaning that they would be hit by the ‘mansion tax’ proposed by the Lib Dems and Labour.

He is paid £134,565 as Deputy Prime Minister and holds an MEP pension, thanks to his five years in Brussels between 1999 and 2004.

His wife is a partner at the international law firm Dechert. Her salary is understood to be about £600,000 a year, although she is paid a second salary – thought to be at least £50,000 a year – as an adviser to the Spanish construction firm Acciona.

The couple also own a home in his Sheffield Hallam constituency.

Aside from the millions he amassed during his lengthy City career, Nicholas Clegg Snr owns a ten-bedroom chateau in Bordeaux, south-west France, which his son often uses for holidays with his family.

The Deputy Prime Minister also makes regular use of his family’s £7 million Swiss ski chalet, between Klosters and Davos.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘I can confirm Nick Clegg’s father gave him this money.

‘He supports his son in his role as an MP, in his role as Deputy Prime Minister, and in his role as leader of the Liberal Democrats.’
