A primary school governor has been given a restraining order banning her from contacting the school's headmistress for the next four years.

Ingrid Chenoweth had been accused of assaulting Karen Middlemore after the teacher tried to stop her son taking part in sports day at St Mawes Community Primary School in Cornwall.

She was cleared of attacking the headmistress, but cannot speak to her until 2019 - apart from during meetings of the school governors.

Mrs Chenoweth, 49, was charged with assault after an altercation with Mrs Middlemore at the school event last June.

Witnesses said that the row began when the governor's 10-year-old son was told he would not be able to participate because he had injured his hand - even though his mother insisted he had recovered from the accident.

The argument grew so fierce that the school later sent round a letter of apology to all parents, but those present said they did not see any signs of physical violence.

One mother said: 'It started when Ingrid's oldest son hurt his wrist playing football. He was checked out but the consultant said he was fine to run.

'It came to sports day and the teachers said he was not allowed to run. Ingrid arrived at the sports day and walked across the track with her son. That is when the argument kicked off.

'The headteacher said it was NHS rules. Ingrid said she had a consultant's report. It was just a huge row that last about 10 minutes. I did not see any physical assault - she wasn't even close to her.

'Everyone could hear this conversation. The worst thing about it was that sports still took place, the children were sat waiting to go to their races.

'The whole thing was a complete nonsense. Ingrid has absolutely been put through the mire. All the parents couldn't believe what had happened.

'There has just been confusion. Nobody is allowed to know anything and we haven't really been allowed to talk openly about it.'

A father of a child at the school added: 'Everyone has been talking about what happened at the sports day. It was quite shocking really and they caused a real scene.'

Speaking after she was cleared of the assault, Mrs Chenoweth - who has two children at the school - said: 'I am very relieved to be exonerated today. I have been through hell for eight months.

'I have always maintained that there was no physical contact between Karen Middlemore and myself and I was not guilty of the offence of common assault.

'My husband David and I are very grateful for the support of many of the parents of children at the school.

'We appreciate their willingness to attend court and give evidence about the incident at sports day on 25 June last year.

'We look forward to participating in the mediation process proposed by the county council and address the communication issues which underpin this incident.'

She added: 'Our focus remains our children and putting their interests first. We will continue to do everything to ensure they thrive at St Mawes Primary School.

'I am very relieved we have got justice. I have accepted the restraining order as I am never planning on going near her again. I have turned that around and view it as a way of protecting me from her.'

The restraining order prevents Mrs Chenoweth from contacting Mrs Middlemore 'directly save when participating in any mediation process arranged by the local authority or when attending a meeting of the board of governors'.

Cornwall Council, speaking on behalf of the school, said that it hoped the hearing would bring an end to the dispute between the two women.

A spokesman said: 'It has been a very difficult time for the school, and staff and governors have acted with great professionalism in dealing with this matter.'
