New York has been voted the rudest and most arrogant state in the U.S by a newly released poll.

But perhaps it has good reason for its inflated sense of superiority - because the survey also found that it had the best food.

The poll carried out by Business Insider/Survey Monkey quizzed  1,603 Americans on their feelings for each state.

New York has been voted the rudest and most arrogant state in the U.S by a newly released poll

The only rule in the survey was that for each question, participants had to vote on a state other than their own

Louisiana was voted the 'drunkest state'

They also decided that the Empire State has the worst sports fans, NYmag reports.

The only rule in the survey was that for each question, participants had to vote on a state other than their own.

The voters decided that California was the best looking, Colorado had the best scenery and Massachusetts had the best accent.

The picked Texas as the state they would like to kick out of the country. Louisiana was the drunkest.

The poll quizzed 1,603 Americans on their feelings for each state. It found the Empire State had the best food, but worst sports fans

The group had trouble deciding which state was the ugliest - but Alabama nudged the lead

The darkest color had the highest number of votes, the whitest color had next to none. This shows that California was the 'hottest' state

A separate survey found that Buffalo, New York, was one of the rudest places in America but residents of New York City were far friendlier than people in the Midwest and the South. 

The results came from a series of maps compiled using Twitter comments.

They studied the prevalence of two simple -- 'good morning' and 'f*** you' -- over the course of several days.

Vertaline, a company that tracks works and phrases on Twitter for paying clients, conducted the study across 462 cities.
