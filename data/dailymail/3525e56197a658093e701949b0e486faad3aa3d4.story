An 18th century Grade I listed castle set in eight hectares of land has been bought for just £700,000.

But Castle Goring, which is in the South Downs National Park outside Worthing, West Sussex, will need more than £2million worth of repairs to restore it to its former glory.

The 15,600 square foot three-storey property has smashed windows, crumbling walls, fragile roofing and just one functioning bathroom.

Sold: The Grade I listed Castle Goring near Worthing, West Sussex, has been bought for just £700,000 but will need more than £2million worth of repairs

Bizarre design: From the front the 15,600 square foot three-storey property looks like a castle and from from behind it is a Greco-Palladian mansion

The castle, built for around £90,000 in 1797 has been in the hands of the 
Somerset family since 1845.

But current incumbent Clement Somerset, 56, decided it was time to sell up as the creaking property's problems spiralled.

Thieves broke into the home in January 2012 and stole £50,000 worth of lead from the roof.

It was the last straw for Mr Somerset who described the property as a 'white elephant' and put it on the market with Strutt and Parker estate agents in March 2013.

He lives in a small flat in a restored section at the top of the property which cost more than £100,000 to bring up to scratch.

Although the property was listed for £500,000, it has been snapped up for in excess of £700,000 after strong interest from potential buyers.

Damage: The leaky domed roof which has some smashed panels of glass. Underneath, the plaster has been damaged. It will cost thousands of pounds to have it brought up to standard        
Run down: This stairwell will need repairs - or possibly to be removed altogether - when the new owner carries out improvement work

Sweeping staircase: This ornate wooden staircase lies at the heart of the property. But unfortunately the property needs £2m worth of repairs

Disrepair: Cracked and damaged plasterwork can be seen at the top of the staircase

The property features an ornate glass
 dome that leaks because several of the panes are broken - and a grand oak 
stairway has had to be supported with a series of iron rods.

A large number of the floorboards have rotted completely and will have to be torn out and replaced.

As the building is listed, however, traditional methods will have to be used to repair the property, adding to the already hefty bill the new owner will face.

Mr Somerset has exchanged contracts with the buyers although the deal is yet to be formally completed.

Grand: The property, built for around £90,000 in 1797, has been in the hands of the Somerset family since 1845

The front of the property was designed to look like the grand Arundel Castle, six miles away, with a clock tower 
and turrets.

From behind it is a Greco-Palladian mansion with grand formal columns.

But the property's unusual design is its very undoing with windows bricked over inside - and doors that go nowhere at all.

Mr Somerset's father Fitzroy was forced 
to leave the property in 1941 when it was requisitioned by the Canadian 
Army. When he got it back four years later it was in a severe state of 
disrepair.

A spokesman from English Heritage said: 'We are looking forward to working with the new owners.

'We need to bring this tremendously important building back into good repair.'

Beautiful: Grand pillars and a wonderfully-restored fireplace, this is one of the better rooms in the property. Many of the floorboards have rotted and need replacing

Restored: A modern fitted kitchen at the top of the property. Mr Somerset had it partially restored at a cost of more than £100,000 - but doesn't have the finances or the expertise to do the rest of the castle

Inner beauty: With high ceilings, grand columns, ornate plasterwork and wonderful views this property has enormous potential

Well-restored: Although part of the property has been repaired, these pictures are unrepresentative of the general dilapidated state of the building

Beautiful view: The grounds as seen from the rear of the property near Worthing, West Sussex. The property is set in eight hectares of land
