Pope Francis was forced to cancel a planned meeting with Sri Lankan bishops - because he was 'exhausted' after a long journey exposed to the sun.

The 78-year-old arrived in the capital Colombo on Tuesday on his Asia tour before travelling for an hour into the city from the airport on roads lined with well-wishers.

The pope was taken in an open-top car with no protection from the strong sun and after a long overnight flight from Rome.

A source working on security arrangements revealed that the pontiff looked 'exhausted' after his journey

A Vatican spokesman had said earlier that the meeting with the bishops had been cancelled due to the pope's late arrival from the airport.

But a source working on security arrangements who asked not to be named told AFP the pontiff looked 'exhausted' after his journey.

Pope Francis has shunned the pomp of his predecessors, and said earlier this year he prefers not to use the bulletproof 'popemobile' favoured by previous pontiffs.

Journalists travelling with him said he appeared on good form during the flight.

But after disembarking, he spent nearly two hours in total greeting dignitaries and well-wishers along the 28-kilometer (18-mile) route into town - under scorching sun.

A weary and delayed Francis skipped a lunchtime meeting with Sri Lanka's bishops to rest before completing the rest of his grueling day

A weary and delayed Francis skipped a lunchtime meeting with Sri Lanka's bishops to rest before completing the rest of his grueling day.

'The health of the pope is good,' the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said today.

'He was a little tired after the 28 kilometers under the sun, but now he has again his strength.'

Francis is the first pope to visit Sri Lanka since the government crushed a 25-year civil war by ethnic Tamil rebels demanding an independent Tamil nation because of perceived discrimination by governments dominated by the Sinhalese majority. 

U.N. estimates say 80,000 to 100,000 people were killed during the war, which ended in 2009; other reports suggest the toll could be much higher.

With 40 costumed elephants lining the airport road behind him and a 21-canon salute booming out, Francis said that finding true peace after so much bloodshed 'can only be done by overcoming evil with good, and by cultivating those virtues which foster reconciliation, solidarity and peace.'

He did not specifically mention Sri Lanka's refusal to cooperate with a U.N. investigation into alleged war crimes committed in the final months of the war. 

But he said: 'The process of healing also needs to include the pursuit of truth, not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity.'

A 2011 U.N. report said up to 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the last months of the civil war, and accused both sides of serious human rights violations. 

It said the government was suspected of deliberately shelling civilians and hospitals and preventing food and medicine from getting to civilians trapped in the war zone. 

The Tamil Tiger rebels were accused of recruiting child soldiers and holding civilians as human shields and firing from among them.

A few months after the U.N. report was released, the government of longtime President Mahinda Rajapaksa released its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission findings, which concluded that Sri Lanka's military didn't intentionally target civilians at the end of the war and that the rebels routinely violated international humanitarian law.

The Vatican estimated that some 200,000-300,000 people lined Francis' route in from the airport

Sri Lanka's new president, Maithripala Sirisena who unseated Rajapaksa last week, has promised to launch a domestic inquiry into wartime abuses, but has also pledged to protect everyone who contributed to the defeat of the Tamil Tiger separatists from international legal action.

Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said the responsibility for finding the truth was Sri Lanka's alone and stressed that Francis had made clear that the goal of determining the truth isn't to open old wounds.

Sirisena, who was sworn in Friday, told Francis in the airport welcoming ceremony that his government aims to promote 'peace and friendship among our people after overcoming a cruel terrorist conflict.'

'We are a people who believe in religious tolerance and coexistence based on our centuries-old heritage,' he said.

In a show of that coexistence, the pope's welcome ceremony at Colombo's airport featured traditional dancers and drummers from both ethnic groups and a children's choir serenading him in both of Sri Lanka's languages.

Tamils, however, say they are still discriminated against, and human rights activists said the previous government wasn't serious about probing rights abuses.

The Vatican estimated that some 200,000-300,000 people lined Francis' route in from the airport.

After resting, Francis met with Sirisena privately at the presidential palace in the late afternoon and then rallied to greet dozens of saffron-robbed Buddhist monks and representatives of Sri Lanka's other main religions.

At one point, he donned a saffron shawl over his shoulders, a traditional Tamil sign of honor.

'What is needed now is healing and unity, not further division and conflict,' Francis told the audience. 

'It is my hope that interreligious and ecumenical cooperation will demonstrate that men and women do not have to forsake their identity, whether ethnic or religious, in order to live in harmony with their brothers and sisters.'

Some 70 percent of Sri Lankans are Buddhist - most from the Sinhalese ethnic group. Another 13 percent are Hindu, most of them Tamil, and some 10 percent are Muslim. 

Catholics make up less than 7 percent of the island nation's 20 million people, but the church counts both Sinhalese and Tamils as members and sees itself as a strong source of national unity.

When John Paul visited in 1995, Buddhist representatives boycotted his interfaith meeting to protest his views on the Buddhist concept of salvation.

'It is a blessing and will be helpful for interreligious friendship,' said the Rev. Wimalananda, a young Buddhist monk, who was out on the street to welcome the pope.

Francis arrived just days after Rajapaksa was upset in an election he had called. 

The victor, Sirisena, had defected from the ruling party in November in a surprise move and won the election by capitalsing on Rajapaksa's unpopularity among ethnic and religious minorities. 

On Wednesday, Francis will canonise Sri Lanka's first saint, the Rev. Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary from India who is credited with having revived the Catholic faith among both Sinhalese and Tamils amid persecution by Dutch colonial rulers, who were Calvinists.

Colombo's beachfront Galle Face Green was filling up on Tuesday evening with people who planned to camp out overnight to secure a good spot for the Mass.

Later in the day he flies into Tamil territory to pray at a shrine beloved by both Sinhalese and Tamil faithful.

On Thursday he heads to the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic country in Asia and the third-largest in the world, for the second and final leg of the journey.
