A former police woman has relived the terrifying night she was shot five times at point blank range as she tackled a pair of psychopathic gunmen who were holding her boyfriend's family hostage.

Petite Isabella Lovadina, 29, fought off the two thugs who had forced their way at gunpoint into the home of boyfriend Nick Koenig's grandmother, where Isabella had just enjoyed a relaxed family dinner.

Four generations of Nick's family were staying at the St. Louis house during the terrifying raid in 2009 in which his cousin Gina, a single mother of two, was shot dead.

Hero: Retired police woman Isabella Lovadina was shot five times tackling a pair of gunmen who were holding her boyfriend's family hostage

But the outcome could have been far worse had it not been for Isabella, who, despite being unarmed herself and having a gun at her head, threw herself at her attackers in a blind fury.

This week in an interview with 48 Hours Mystery on CBS, Isabella recalled how a perfect evening had spiralled into a terrifying nightmare and why, despite the risks, she had felt compelled to act.  

Nick, a fireman, had met Isabella at an emergency medical training class. He invited her to his grandmother Ida's house to have a meal and then study afterwards.

Ordeal: Angelina had been studying at the home of her then boyfriend fireman Nick Koenig. She was leaving for home at around half past midnight when two men pulled up in a car and drew guns

Isabella told CBS: 'I really felt comfortable in that house, there was just a really warm feeling. I'm sure the people that lived there, you know, Nick's family had a lot to do with that.'

At around half past midnight the pair finished studying and Nick walked Isabella to her car. She put her gun and bulletproof vest inside the vehicle and went back to give Nick a goodnight hug.

Suddenly they heard a screech of tyres and Isabella looked up to see two men with guns drawn walking towards them.

One of the men demanded: 'Give me whatever you've got.'

After Isabella told him she had nothing, the man pointed towards Nick's grandmother's home and demanded: 'who's in the house?'

Victim: Mr Koenig's cousin, mother-of-two Gina Stallis (right) was killed in the raid

Nick pleaded with them to leave saying there were women and children asleep inside, but the two men forced them at gunpoint to walk back in.

Isabella continued: 'They became very angry, it was "put your f---ing head on the ground, I'll kill you."

'My mind just went into police mode. What am I going to do to keep everybody in this house safe... and get them out?

'I was constantly peeking at them, trying to memorise their features, what they were wearing, any kind of description I could give to the police.

'One of 'em was wearing a red hoodie and dark pants. The other one was wearing a black hoodie.'

With one of the men holding Isabella and Nick on the ground at gunpoint, the other went upstairs where grandmother Ida Rask, aunt Rose Whitrock, cousin Gina Stallis and her two children Sam and Ben were in bed.

Gina awoke to a menacing black handgun being waved in her face and was ordered to carry a heavy, old-fashioned television downstairs set with her.

Isabella recalled: 'I saw Gina carrying this large - older television down the stairs and the guy in the red hoodie had the gun pointed to her back. following her down.

'I couldn't believe she was able to even carry the television. And once she got downstairs and knelt next to me all she wanted, all she asked was if it was OK if she could check on her kids.

'They just yelled back "I'll kill you bitch, shut up put your head on the ground."'

With tears streaming down her face Gina begged Isabella to do something.

Isabella knelt on the floor with a gun trained at her head, certain that if she didn't act everyone was going to die. As the anger welled up inside her she decided she would go out fighting.

Guilty: Ledale Nathan Jr, 16 at the time of the raid, received life without parole plus five life terms plus 75 years. Mario Coleman, 24, was sentenced to life without parole plus five life terms plus 90 years

'I thought, "I'm not gonna let this happen. I'm not gonna let somebody kill me while I'm on my knees with my head on the ground. I'm not going out that way."

'I looked down the barrel of the gun... and with everything that I had in me, I lunged towards the guy with the black hoodie and -- and just began to fight.'

Despite her relatively small size, such was the force of the impact that Isabella sent the gunman flying across the room into the front door. At that moment Nick jumped up and flung himself at the other man. Then all hell broke loose.

Nick told CBS: 'I turn and all I see is Isabella on the floor in a fetal position, and the guy in the black hoodie is standing right over her, just shootin' her, shootin' her and shootin' her.

'Then I feel and explosion from my neck. And then right after that I can feel warm blood just dripping down the whole front of my chest. Then they were gone. They must have run out of the house.'

As Isabella dragged herself towards him, Nick turned to see his cousin Gina lying with her eyes wide open. 

Her 10-year-old son Sam whimpered: 'Nick, is my mommy OK?'

All Nick could think to say was that she'd fainted and would be alright.

Honour: Isabella is awarded the Medal of Valour by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon

Nick's aunt Rose had managed to escape the house and had been tearing down the street banging on neighbours' doors and screaming for help.

Meanwhile young Sam managed to find a mobile phone and coolly called 911.

Ambulances were on the way, but for Isabella, who had been shot five times and was loosing a lot of blood, it would be touch and go.

Thankfully the paramedics arrived in time and both Nick and Isabella were rushed to hospital.

Nick had been shot three times. One of the bullets had hit him under the ear and had gone through the back of his neck and lodged in his spinal cord.

Tragically Gina was dead.

Across the city, one of the raiders walked into the emergency room at Barnes Hospital claiming he had been shot in the hand.

A quick witted X-ray operator realised that something wasn't quite right and the hospital contacted the police who arrive to see the man walking out to his car next to which his accomplice is waiting.

The cops followed the man to a nearby park where where they saw him throw something onto the ground. He is later apprehended and jewellery belonging to Nick's grandmother Ida is found in his pocket.

Police recover a black handgun from the park.

Officers determine that he was the man in the black hoodie. His name is Mario Coleman. The second man, Ledale Nathan Jr, is also arrested.

Isabella was able to identify both men from a photo line-up from he hospital bed.

Coleman, 24, was sentenced to life without parole for first-degree murder plus five life terms plus 90 years. LeDale Nathan Jr., received life without parole plus five life terms plus 75 years.

Sadly Isabella's injuries meant she had to retire from the force. She was commended for her bravery, awarded the Medal of Valour by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon and even had a day named after her by the Mayor of St. Louis.

Almost a year and a half after the shooting Nick was involved in a car crash in which he hit his head on the windshield. A few days later he felt a lump at the back of his throat and coughed out the bullet that had been lodged in his spinal cord.

Isabella added: 'I look at my life differently now. I see how fragile it is and how it can be taken away so fast and without any notice.

'I don't have a new career picked out.

'I still know that I want to help people. It's just gonna be in a different way now.'
