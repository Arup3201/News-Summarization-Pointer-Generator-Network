Tortured: James Ross was allegedly held hostage for 13 days

A British man had an ear, two fingers and three toes chopped off during an horrific 13-day kidnap ordeal over an alleged £10,000 drug debt, a court has heard.

James Ross, 28, was allegedly tortured in a secluded villa in Portugal's Algarve by a gang of five fellow Britons in May 2010.

The former postman was also sodomised with an iron bar, had one of his testicles severed and his tendons slashed - before they tried to murder him by driving a car he was in into a reservoir.

The defendants, including William Quinn, 54, and Calum Macleod, 45, of the Western Isles, all deny the charges.

Manchester-based Steve Johnson, also known as John Maclean, 48, Terence McGurk, 33, and Ronnie Rose, 25, from the Midlands, are also on trial.

Witness Carlos Pereira told the opening day of the trial at Loule Court how he found Mr Ross, of Caithness, Scotland, in the street 'bloodstained and missing an ear and a finger'.

He said he looked like a 'car crash victim' as he walked 'with difficulty' and 'with his arms in the air'.

Loule Court's prosecution said Mr Ross was lured to the Algarve in October 2010 with the promise of a job growing cannabis to pay off a £10,000 drug-trafficking debt.

He flew out to Faro Airport on October 5, before being taken to a remote location against his will.

He was then, it is alleged, brutally 
tortured for 13 days before escaping his captors in the village of 
Colinquelme, near the town of Loule, on October 18.

He was found bleeding in the street in the nearby village of Alfontes by Mr Pereira, who told the court he lived near the villa where Mr Ross was allegedly held captive.

He said he knew the accused and had seen many people coming in and out of the house, where sports cars were frequently also seen.

Johnson,  accused of being the mastermind of the kidnapping and of luring Mr Ross to Portugal, faces two additional charges alleging illegal possession of a gun and ammunition.

The prosecution said the initial plan was to kill Mr Ross by trapping him in a car and pushing it into the Santa Clara dam in the Alentejo region north of the Algarve, but this failed.

It is not clear if Mr Ross, who was not present in court, will later have to give evidence in front of his alleged torturers.

The five accused have been held in custody in Portugal since their arrests in 2010. The trial continues.
