A father-of-three died months after being given the all-clear from the cancer a doctor misdiagnosed when he first fell ill.

Mark Browne from Lincoln was told by his GP that he was 'too young' to be suffering from bowel cancer, and was diagnosed with piles.

Mr Browne's widow and three children this week agreed an undisclosed settlement at the High Court in Nottingham, two years after his death, following an admission of liability by Mr Browne's GP.

The Lincolnshire Echo reported Dr Smith admitted care failures after he wrongly diagnosed Mr Browne as suffering from piles rather than cancer.

When Dr Nicholas Smith of Birchwood Medical Practice in Lincoln carried out an internal examination on Mr Browne, he failed to detect the then 3cm tumour.

Mr Browne, who was over the age of 40, had been complaining of stomach pains and passing blood, but was not referred to the hospital.

A year later, doctors discovered a 6cm cancerous tumour, starting Mr Browne on a 
course of treatment.

The Browne family 's lawyer said if Mark’s cancer had not been missed the first time he may still be alive today.

Neil Clayton, from law firm Lime, who
 represented Mark Browne, said: 'Had Dr Smith correctly referred Mark in
 December of 2008 he would have been operated on in February 2009 and 
thus likely avoided the return of the tumour which was at the root of 
his painful and distressing symptoms and the immediate cause of his 
death.

'He also would not have developed cancer in his lungs and he would have likely survived.'

His wife Teresa, 38, said: 'As far as Mark was concerned there was nothing to worry about.

A year after misdiagnosing Mr Browne's condition, doctors discovered a 6cm cancerous tumour, starting him on a course of treatment. He was later given the all-clear after a course of chemotherapy and an operation - but afterwards was told that the cancer had spread to his lungs. He is pictured here with his children

Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England.

It is a general term for caner that begins in the large bowel.

Symptoms include passing blood and unexplained changes in bowel habits, such as prolonged diarrhoea or constipation, as well as weight loss.

Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases develop in people aged 65 or older.

Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy.

If bowel cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages, the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent, and a complete cure is usually possible.

However, bowel cancer diagnosed in its most advanced stage only has a five-year survival rate of 6 per cent and a complete cure is unlikely.

'He was very black and white and if the doctors told him he was fine, then he was fine - he took it as gospel.

'Mark was given some suppositories to treat the piles and that was it.

'Mark was a man’s man and very proud. I really had to push him to go to the doctors in the first place.

'It wasn’t really a normal thing we would talk about.'

But 12 months later Mr Browne was still passing blood, prompting his wife to insist he returned to the doctors.

In September 2009 he visited a different doctor, who performed a rectal examination immediately making an urgent two-week referral.

MRI scans revealed Mr Browne had a 6cm cancerous tumour.

Mrs Browne said: 'We were angry it hadn’t been spotted before but Mark took everything in his stride and was very matter-of-fact about it.'

Her husband underwent a colostomy, before starting a long course of radiation chemotherapy - the aim to shrink Mr Browne’s tumour before performing keyhole surgery to remove it.

Mr Browne's wife, Teresa, who is pictured here with their children, said: 'In hindsight he and I wished he'd got a second opinion or questioned the doctor again when things didn't clear up. My advice to anyone is to insist on a second opinion or second examination'

Mrs Browne said: 'Mark was very strong and brave. He continued to provide for his family throughout his illness.

'In hindsight he and I wished he’d got a second opinion or questioned the doctor again when things didn’t clear up.

'My advice to anyone is to insist on a second opinion or second examination - even if you think you are being a nuisance - rather than risk what happened to Mark.

'Doctors are only human - they’re not 100 per cent infallible - and sometimes get things wrong.

'I still grieve for my husband and it’s very painful for me to talk about what happened.

'However, I made a promise to Mark before he died that I would speak out because awareness of his case might help save the life of just one person by getting them to have a check up or ask for a second opinion.'

After treatment and further surgery to remove the tumour and part of Mr Browne’s rectum in February 2010, the father-of-three endured more chemotherapy.

The Browne’s then attended an appointment at Lincoln County Hospital in October 2010, where they were told by a nurse that Mr Browne's results were back and were all clear.

Mrs Browne said: 'The nurse told us Mark’s results were all clear and we were overjoyed.

'We thought Mark had beaten the disease and we began to piece our lives back together.

'We thought he’d been cured.'

The family enjoyed Christmas together as Mr Browne concentrated on building his strength.

After five happy months, he attended another follow up appointment with his oncologist in March 2011.

Mrs Browne said: 'Our illusion was shattered when Mark’s oncologist told us in that the cancer wasn’t gone had spread to his lungs. We were told it was not treatable.

'It was a tragic blow, which we hoped we would never have to experience.

Mr Browne's tragic situation is reminiscent of the recent death of Midlands teen Stephen Sutton (pictured), who recently passed away after a four-year battle against the disease

'It was devastating to find out the 
cancer wasn’t gone and had spread, after spending the previous months 
getting our lives back and looking to the future.'

Mr Browne continued to work as a road planner but as his condition deteriorated his wife gave up her job as a sales assistant, to care for her husband of 18 years.

In August, Mr Browne's condition worsened and after five weeks in hospital he was allowed home for his final days.

He slipped into a coma on August 7, 2012 and died in his sleep in Mrs Browne's arms two days later, aged 46.

Mr
 Browne's tragic situation is reminiscent of the recent death of 
Midland’s teen Stephen Sutton, who recently passed away after a 
four-year battle against the disease.

Manjit Darby, Director of Nursing and Quality at NHS England, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire said:  'NHS England, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire is committed to ensuring that patients receive the best possible primary care services.

'We take extremely seriously incidents where a patient suffers distress or harm whilst in the receipt of NHS care and we will be reviewing the details of this case further to determine any appropriate action that needs to be taken.

Birchwood Medical Practice declined to comment. The Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland, who represented Dr Smith, were unavailable for comment.
