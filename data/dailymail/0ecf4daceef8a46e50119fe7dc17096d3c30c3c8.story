'Dangerous situation': Mark Duggan (pictured) was shot by police marksmen as he got out of a minicab with a loaded gun and motioned as if he was about to shoot, a court has heard

Mark Duggan was preparing to aim a gun
when he was killed by police in a shooting that triggered the summer 
riots last year, a court was told yesterday.

Officers said the suspected gangster 
started to ‘bring round’ the converted black pistol ‘as if to shoot’ 
before they opened fire.

The weapon, a BBM Bruni Model 92 held 
in an adapted black sock, was found on a grass verge nearby with a 
single 9mm bullet in the magazine.

Dramatic details of the confrontation 
were revealed at the trial of an ‘associate’ accused of passing him the 
gun just 15 minutes earlier.

Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, faces 
claims he handed over the gun in a women’s shoe box while a police 
surveillance team waited nearby.

The death of Duggan at the hands of 
police triggered rioting that spread like wildfire across English cities
over four nights in August last year.

It is the first time police have revealed what happened when a team of armed undercover officers surrounded his minicab.

Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said Duggan had been under surveillance by the Metropolitan Police for two days when he was killed.

He said police officers followed him 
as he travelled to meet Hutchinson-Foster outside his girlfriend’s house
in Leyton, East London, on August 4.

When his minicab moved on they decided
to launch a ‘hard stop’ operation, intercepting the vehicle and 
arresting 29-year-old Duggan.

Mr Brown told Snaresbrook Crown Court that events took place ‘very quickly’ in Ferry Lane, in Tottenham, North London.

He said: ‘The armed police surrounded the cab. As Mark Duggan got out he was seen to have a gun in his hand ...

‘The police marksmen were in no doubt 
that this was as dangerous position as possible - gun in hand, and he 
was seen to bring it round as if to shoot.

‘The gun was found to be loaded with a bullet and Mark Duggan was shot. He fell to the ground fatally injured.

‘From that moment until the ambulances and helicopter ambulance arrived they sought to resuscitate him but to no avail.

‘The gun was found on the grass bank that runs along the side of Ferry Lane. It was still in the sock.’

Mr Duggan was handed the weapon just 15 minutes before he was killed, a trial has heard

The jury was told telephone analysis, 
forensic evidence and witness accounts link Hutchinson-Foster with the 
gun and his meeting with Duggan.

Mr Brown said he repeatedly called him and evidence from their phones and the minicab’s GPS laid bare their movements.

The gun was found in a black sock with
the toe ripped to expose the barrel and the heel opened to allow access
to the cocking lever, the court was told.

Forensic tests revealed it was covered in DNA from Hutchinson-Foster and a second man, barber Peter Osadebay.

Hutchinson-Foster admitted attacking 
and pistol-whipping Mr Osadebay during an attack at a hairdressing salon
in Dalston, East London, six days earlier.

CCTV images showed how the two men 
rowed before Hutchinson-Foster returned with the gun, pointing it at his
victim’s chest and hitting him over the head with it.

Mr Brown said the gun was originally 
held in a cardboard yellow and black River Island shoe box belonging to 
Hutchinson-Foster’s girlfriend.

When it was examined Duggan’s fingerprints were found on it in a position which showed he must have opened it, it was claimed.

Mr Brown told the jury it was not 
their task to decide ‘the rights and wrongs of the shooting of Mark 
Duggan’ as these will be addressed in an inquest next year.

He said: ‘They were tragic events in 
Ferry Lane, on any account. But the issue for you, the jury, in this 
case is who supplied the gun to Mark Duggan.’

Prosecutors allege Mr Duggan collected the weapon from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, before continuing to Tottenham (above), where the riots later broke out

Hutchinson-Foster, of no fixed abode, 
denies selling or transferring a prohibited firearm to Mr Duggan between
28 July and 5 August last year.

He told police he was attacked by up 
to ten men, including Duggan, and was hit on the head with the gun 
several days before the two incidents.

The trial, which is expected to last up to four weeks, continues.
