A four-year-old boy found wandering near the wreckage of a horrific car crash that killed his father and critically injured his mother is pictured for the first time.

Tanner McCarthy was found with just scratches and bruises outside the twisted wreck that killed his father Eric McCarthy and injured his mother Amber just north of Houston, Texas early Monday morning.

Like Tanner, Mrs McCarthy was thrown from the vehicle as it flipped on its roof and into a ditch, but the young mother was found lying unconscious near the wreckage.

Saved: Four-year-old Tanner McCarthy was found with just scratches and bruises outside the wreckage that killed his father Eric McCarthy and critically injured his mother

Tragedy: Tanner's father Eric McCarthy, left, was killed while his mother, Amber, right, was found unconscious lying near the vehicle

'He was out here just wandering around in a ditch not really understanding what is going on and scared,' David Ward, Eric McCarthy's stepfather told KHOU.

'He had the wings of angels watching over him,' family friend Linda Knight told KHOU. 'That is the only explanation. God was watching over him.'

The accident around 2am was just two 
blocks away from a relative's home near Conroe where the young family 
was said to be heading to visit the boy's grandparents.

Mr Ward said the boy didn't entirely understand what happened at the time of the crash.

'He was excited when he saw all the fire trucks,' he said.

Incredible: A little boy somehow survived this horrific car crash and was found with just cuts and bruises, wandering at the side of the road

Flipped: The car ended up on its roof. Police say it veered from the road and hit a pipe causing it to overturn

Unknown: Tanner is said to have not understood what happened at the time of the crash and still doesn't know the tragic fate of his father

'He had no clue what happened,' Ms Knight said. 'Now, how to explain to a 4-year-old that his daddy is gone? I donâ€™t know how to fathom that.'

Tanner was taken in by a neighbor nearby while fire fighters worker to free his father and revive his mother.

Mrs McCarthy remains in critical condition in a hospital, having suffered a broken neck, pelvis, hip and other injuries.

Investigation: Police are still trying piece together what happened near the city of Conroe, just north of Houston

How did they survive? Police say the car flipped at speed tossing a mother and child into this ditch. The little boy's dad died in the crash

An investigation into the cause of 
the crash is underway by state troopers who say it was an isolated 
crash, involving just that one vehicle.

A skid mark left at the scene shows the vehicle having hit its brakes well before leaving the roadway

Police said they believe the car veered, hitting a pipe at the side of the road and flipped.
