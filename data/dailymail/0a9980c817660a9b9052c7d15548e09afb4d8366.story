Any overly refreshed visitors to Hamburg should think twice next time they fancy relieving themselves up against a wall.  

That's because residents of the pub-heavy area at the heart of the party town are fighting back against so-called 'Wildpinkler', which literally means 'free pee-ers' in German.

Members of the St Pauli Interest Community (IG St Pauli) fed up with drinkers weeing everywhere from back alleys to underpasses to childrens' playgrounds are using a special paint to give them a nasty surprise.

St Pauli Interest Community members have put up warning signs - put not every painted wall has them

Water droplets bounce right off the hydrophobic paint with which the residents have coated dozens of walls across a district which welcomes 20 million often heavy-drinking party guests every year. 

Now public urinators can expect some splash back on their shoes and clothes should they decide to empty their bladders in the street.   

IG St Pauli board member and owner of several local bars Uwe Christiansen told The Local: 'It was a real annoyance that was growing and growing'

'We wanted to bring people to reason.'

So-called 'Wildpinkler', or 'free pee-ers', have even been caught urinating in playgrounds in St Pauli

In a short video produced by the group, members can be seen putting up signs reading 'DO NOT PEE HERE! We pee back' on specially-treated walls.

Those falling foul of the clever ruse can be seen jumping back in horror as they get more than they bargained for when they unzipped their trousers. 

As Julia Staron of IG St Pauli says at the end of the video: 'Watch out! From now on, it's Peeback time'.

Christiansen added: 'People were just tired of the peeing on walls, home entrances and playgrounds.'

And visitors should take extra care as not every wall which has been treated has a warning sign.
