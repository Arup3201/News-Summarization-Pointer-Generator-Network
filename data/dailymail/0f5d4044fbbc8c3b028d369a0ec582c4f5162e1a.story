A pet owner has been slammed by animal lovers after she was filmed dragging her cat on a lead. 

The woman was filmed as she pulled the black-and-white cat down a street in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, last Sunday.

Lilly Dance captured the moment on her mobile phone and uploaded the five-second clip to Facebook. She said it has since received hundreds of comments from outraged viewers.

Lilly Allen, who captured the moment (pictured) on her phone, said she initially thought it was 'quite amusing' to see a cat being walked on a lead but tried to intervene when she realised the animal was 'being dragged'

An expert from the RSPCA said the charity had 'concerns' about the handling of the cat and that the video shows the animal in a state of 'distress'.

Miss Dance said she initially thought it was 'quite amusing' to see a cat being walked on a lead but tried to intervene when she realised the animal was 'being dragged'.

The 26-year-old said the owner ignored her and continued pulling the animal 'for a good five minutes' before picking up the cat. 

She said: 'She caught me filming her but then she dragged the cat down the road anyway.

'I said to her that she might want to pick the cat up but she ignored me and kept going.

'It was only a little black and white kitten. At first I thought it was funny but the more I look at it I just think she was horrible.'

The woman noticed she was being filmed but continued to drag the cat behind her, Miss Dance said

Alice Potter, a companion animal scientist from the RSPCA, said the five-second video shows the animal was distressed.

She said: 'We have concerns about the handling of the cat in this footage as it appears to be causing it distress.

'The cat does look like it's kind of being dragged and looks distressed, putting its front paws out like it wants to stop.

'Without seeing more it's hard to know how comfortable the cat is walking on a lead but it gives the impression that the cat was not particularly comfortable or relaxed.'

She added that putting cats on leads took away their 'sense of control' and that harnesses should be introduced gradually from a young age if owners want to put them on a lead.
