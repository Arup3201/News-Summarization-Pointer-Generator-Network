Rickie Lambert may tire of the fascination with his work with beetroot, but his personal journey from the factory where he screwed lids on jars to playing for England at the World Cup will inspire a generation of rejected footballers to fight back.

He is the 21st-century standard- bearer for the rise from part-time football to the very top of the professional game. This season, at Liverpool, he will venture into the Champions League as others try to emulate his progress.

Among them are three English strikers who, like Lambert, arrive in the Barclays Premier League via promotion, rather than because top-flight clubs took a chance on some of the unsung talent in the lower leagues.

The big time: Jamie Vardy (L), Charlie Austin (C) and Danny Ings (R) have worked their way up to the top flight

Charlie Austin, Danny Ings and Jamie Vardy, who have all played non-League football in the past five years, scored 62 goals between them last season and there is no reason they should stop as they begin their careers in the Premier League this weekend.

‘What Rickie has done has been incredible,’ said QPR’s Austin, a 25-year-old who has met each challenge since Swindon paid £50,000 to Poole Town in 2009 for the bricklayer.

‘I’ve taken it well so far and hopefully I can take my chance in the Premier League. You have to learn. There’s a lot more to it than scoring goals but it helps massively and if you’ve got that natural instinct then you’re on to a winner.

‘It is hard not to look back five years, when I was training for Poole on a Tuesday and Thursday, and not pinch myself but my family keep my feet on the ground and remind me of what it was like beforehand.’

Danny Wilson was the Swindon manager who took a chance on the young striker who had been released by Reading and hopped from Kintbury Rangers to Hungerford Town before joining Poole in the Wessex League, the ninth tier of English football.

‘I remember it well,’ said Wilson. ‘It was teeming down with rain and I could have gone home after half an hour. I liked what I saw. He was always in the right areas at the right time. He was brave, flinging himself at the ball, putting defenders under pressure. He was quite raw but you could see there was something to work on. More than that, he just had a natural instinct and was a massive threat. Bournemouth had been looking closely, but they were struggling financially at the time, so we went in and did a deal.’

Austin was 20 at the time. He scored the winner at Carlisle on his first start in November 2009, the winner against Huddersfield three days later and the winner against Leyton Orient on his next appearance. By the end of the season he had 20 goals and Swindon were at Wembley in the play-off final, which they lost to Millwall.

‘He was never fazed by it,’ said Wilson. ‘He uses his body well and is never looking for the perfect goal. He’s happy to finish early, which surprises defenders and goalkeepers.

‘There’s no reason at all why he can’t keep doing it in the Premier League. If he thinks the opportunity is there, he’ll try to score.’

Burnley bought Austin for £1million, then sold him to QPR for £4.5m last year and Ings stepped into the void, forging a prolific partnership with Sam Vokes.

Ings was released by Southampton as a teenager and picked up by Bournemouth, who gave him a three-month contract and sent him on loan to Dorchester Town in the Conference South (tier six).

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe was impressed by his development, rewarding Ings with a longer deal and returning to sign him for £1m when he moved to Burnley and earned an England Under 21 call-up. He was last season’s Championship Player of the Year.

Vardy’s journey is equally startling. Released by Sheffield Wednesday, he worked in factories and played for £30 a game for Stocksbridge Park Steels, helping them climb into the Northern Premier Division (tier seven).

While there, he was convicted of assault after a pub fight and played wearing an electronic tag, dashing home after games to comply with a 6pm curfew.

‘I’m not proud of what happened but it happened,’ said Vardy. ‘I’ve turned my life round.’

Halifax manager Neil Aspin refused to listen to those warning him to keep away from Vardy and nagged his chairman to pay £15,000 to sign him.

‘It was a big gamble for us,’ said Aspin. ‘He turned up for training and we were running around a track and he didn’t have the right running shoes. He didn’t look like a footballer but as soon as they saw him play, everyone knew he was special.

He had unbelievable pace off the mark, he could play either side, chased back and worked so hard. He never caused me any trouble and was popular in the dressing-room.’

In little more than a year, Halifax had won the Northern Premier League and sold Vardy to Fleetwood in a deal which would be worth more than £500,000 once the Yorkshire club had banked their share of the sell-on from his £1m transfer to Leicester in 2012.

‘I always thought he was good enough to play in the Championship, but he had to make the step to Fleetwood, where he took the Conference by storm,’ said Aspin.

Stat's impressive! Jamie Vardy scored 34 goals in 40 games for lower league side Fleetwood

Vardy scored 34 in 40 games as Fleetwood were promoted to the Football League as champions.

‘There’s no reason why he can’t do it in the Premier League. He’s got the desire and the pace. He’s still new to full-time training, so he’s improving. He will do well. I’m pleased it’s worked out for him.’

At 27, Vardy is the eldest of the trio, but Lambert was 30 on his Premier League debut and a year older when winning his first cap.

The precedent is set for three Englishmen born to score as they embark on the biggest season of their lives. It is about attitude and desire. It is about seizing the chance.
