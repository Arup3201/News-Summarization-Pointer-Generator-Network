English backs are firmly against the wall at Twickenham today and, going by recent history, that suits them fine. Stuart Lancaster’s side must resurrect the knack for summoning strength in adversity.

Defeat against Australia today would mean no escape from the blunt conclusion that they have spent this autumn locked in reverse, just when they were seeking to climb into the higher gears.

This final instalment of the QBE series represents a shot at salvation of sorts and England will hurl themselves into it knowing that a full house of losses against the southern hemisphere giants would be an unacceptable return from a month of Tests in London.

Yet, desperation has been their ally in the past. During Lancaster’s tenure, his men have often delivered when cornered. They did so in their first match with an untried line-up and novice captain, against Scotland at Murrayfield at the start of 2012, and that set a bloody-minded tone.

The same streak of resilience under fire was evident in Port Elizabeth months later, when England went into the final Test of three against South Africa 2-0 down and weakened by injuries, only to fight tooth and nail for a commendable draw.

Later that year came the ultimate illustration of this stubborn character trait, as Chris Robshaw and his side — battered by criticism after back-to-back defeats — stunned the All Blacks with a record 38-21 victory at Twickenham.

Those were the encouraging early benchmarks of spirit under fire which need to be emulated this afternoon. 

Lancaster's team have a habit of delivering a big performance when their backs are to the wall 

For all their indignation about the negative reviews this November, it is imperative that England add substance to their defiance by winning.

To do so, they will not be afraid to embrace traditional English virtues. The pack have often been dominant this month and the signs are that Lancaster will order his men to lean heavily on that likely advantage up front.

Two recalled players explained the thinking. Hooker Dylan Hartley said: ‘We have to test them out and see what is working and if the maul is working, stick to it — don’t get bored of doing it. I don’t care if people think it is boring. If it is working and it is killing them, let’s exploit it and keep going.’

Tom Wood, reinstated in the back row, reflected on decision-making shortcomings which have hampered England’s ambitions this month.

‘We are not where we want to be,’ he said. ‘Our set-piece has been strong, but we’ve lacked continuity and a real understanding of what we’re trying to achieve in the middle third of the field. In that middle zone, you can get muddled up.

‘Are we keeping the ball and playing multi-phase or are we expecting them to rush off the line continuously and make big hits so we’ll keep chipping the ball in behind them and turning them?

‘I think we’ve got ourselves a little bit mixed up in the last few weeks. Hopefully this week in training we have put a plan in place to iron that out.’

George Ford, England’s exciting new No 10, concedes that the backs must repay their team-mates in the pack for sterling service this month, which has been undermined by a lack of clarity and ‘smart’ play behind the scrum.

But Wood was right to conclude that it hasn’t been a simple case of good up front, poor behind.

The home forwards have to carry and connect more astutely, while also sharpening their breakdown work, which Graham Rowntree admits is still a ‘work in progress’.

With that target in mind, there has been a continual tweaking of methods at the ruck, minds focused by the prospect of competing with Australia’s supreme openside and captain Michael Hooper.

England have had a superb set-piece platform in their recent matches, but they are wary of the threat posed by the Wallabies in the scrum.

Rowntree, England’s forwards coach, suggested that the visitors are ‘dishonest’ in the way they seek to avoid a straight pushing contest, but Australia head coach Michael Cheika offered an alternative take on the matter yesterday.

England's powerful scrum has been one of the biggest positives from this autumn series 

‘I definitely think they’re going to target us there,’ he said. ‘They are probably more tactical than we are. They turn and wheel and move to the left.’

When told England suggested his side were the ones guilty of such antics, Cheika added: ‘All that talk they carry on about — we are trying to milk penalties and that kind of business — it’s all irrelevant.

‘I don’t think any referee is going to be influenced by Graham Rowntree saying we are trying to turn the scrum.

 ‘What we’ve got to do is be really united in how our binds are, get our body height right and push very, very hard.’

Dylan Hartley insists that if England get an edge up front and in the set-piece, they will exploit it 

That is a straightforward philosophy, but these Wallabies do not present a straightforward threat.

Their commitment to attacking in wide channels through instinctive runners such as Israel Folau and Henry Speight makes them dangerous, even counter-attacking from deep. Andy Farrell described them yesterday as England’s ‘biggest test, defensively’.

Lancaster’s team must not be afraid to revert to the old staples of territory and forward force if that is what it takes.

Their backs are to the wall and if they are true to themselves, that means they will be inspired.
