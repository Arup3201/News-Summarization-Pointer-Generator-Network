Seth Rogen showed up to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to give an emotional address about Alzheimer's disease, but his sadness soon turned to ire as he watched Congress members leave the already nearly empty hearing.

'All those empty seats are senators who are not prioritizing Alzheimer's,' the normally jovial Rogen tweeted following the hearing.

He followed up his speech with an appearance on Hardball in which he again called out the 16 Senators who ducked out early or failed to even show up to his speech.

Disappointed: Actor Seth Rogen was non-too-happy with the showing at his Senate Committee on Appropriations after only 2 of the Senator members deigned to sit through his emotional speech on the disease

Empty house: Only two senators--Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin and Kansas Republican Jerry Moran--stayed to listen to Rogen. He even watched some of them leave

'It's indicative of a mentality that we find so frustrating. It seems like these people don't care,' he told host Chris Matthews.

Making the poor showing by the all the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies members more offensive was how one of his central issues was of the ignorance and even shame surrounding the disease.

Rogen said he even watched as many of the committee members stood and left before he addressed them.

In a particularly confounding move, Senator Mark Kirk even tweeted at Rogen thanking him for his speech.

'Thanks to @Sethrogen for speaking out about efforts to #ENDALZ. RT if you know someone affected by #Alzheimers,' wrote the Illinois Republican.

Oops: Senator Mark Kirk had the nerve to thank Rogen for his speech and even tweeted out a photo of himself with the actor, but didn't stay for the speech

Lashing out: Rogen was a charmer while he addressed the mere two Senators who stuck around to hear him, but afterwards he made his true feelings known

Only he didn't see it. At least not in person.

'Pleasure meeting you. Why did you leave before my speech? Just curious,' Rogen shot back.

if the actor seems touchy, it's because the issue hits very close to home for him.

Rogen’s mother-in-law Adele Miller was diagnosed with the disease very early and the 31-year-old actor told the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services how his view of the devastating illness changed as he watched her slowly lose the ability to care for herself.

The Pineapple Express star spoke in support of legislation that would increase federal funding for Alzheimer's disease while his emotional wife Lauren Miller sat watching from the  gallery.

Is this thing on? The jolly actor broke the ice with a few off-color jokes, the likes of which such dry committee hearings rarely see

Above it all: 'This has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana,' he joked. 'In fact, if you can believe it, this concerns something that I find even more important'

Despite the poor attendance, Rogen deftly broke the ice in what would ordinarily have been a typically dry subcommittee hearing.

‘This has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana,’ he joked. ‘In fact, if you can believe it, this concerns something that I find even more important.’

Laughs rippled through the room. The actor was making weed jokes to senators.

Rogen also poked fun at Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).

'You told me you never saw Knocked Up, chairman,' he said, after lamenting that the committee members had no clue who he was.

‘I will wager this is the first time in any congressional hearing in history that the words "knocked up" have been used,' Harkin shot back.

Rogen soon got serious about why he was there.

Close to home: Rogen's mother-in-law Adele Miller was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's in her mid-50s. She'd forgotten who she was and how to care for herself by 60. Here, Rogen sits with his wife Lauren Miller at the Capitol Hill hearing

‘I started dating my wife Lauren nine years ago when her mother was almost 54 years old. It was during this trip, the first time I met my now mother-in-law, that Lauren first admitted to herself and then to me that something was off with her mother,’ he said. ‘Soon after this trip at 55 years old Lauren's mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.’

Rogen said Adele Miller’s Alzheimer’s did not only begin early in life, but also progressed quickly.

‘After forgetting who she and her loved one were,’ Rogen told the panel. ‘She forgot how to speak, feed herself, dress herself, all by age of 60.’

Rogen is one of the Alzheimer's Association’s celebrity champions. He’s also started his own charity with his wife.

‘The situation is so dire, that it caused me, a lazy, self-involved, generally self-medicated man-child, to start an entire charity organization,’ he said.

The 'Knocked Up' star praised his father-in-law for making Adele comfortable as her disease progresses and opened up about his decision to start his own fund, 'Hilarity for Charity,' to support other families and research on the illness.

He added: ’I came here today for few reasons. One I'm a huge “House of Cards” fan. ... Two, people need more help. I've personally witnessed the massive amount of financial strain this disease causes. ...Three, to show people they are not alone, so few people share their personal stories.’

The attendees were moved by Rogen's words but the actor was disappointed in the attendance
