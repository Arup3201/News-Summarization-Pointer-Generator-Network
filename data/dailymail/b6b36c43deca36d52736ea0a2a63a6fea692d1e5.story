Arsenal suffered yet another defeat at the hands of London rivals Chelsea on Sunday, going down 2-0 at Stamford Bridge courtesy of goals from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa. After Arsene Wenger's latest setback we asked Arsenal fan site Le Grove what went wrong in west London and where the Frenchman is going wrong.

Nothing at Arsenal will improve until the three years of Arsene Wenger's contract are up and we can bring in fresh ideas with an approach that puts planning and detail at the core.

The failings of Wenger's summer transfer planning were once again exposed against Chelsea, who delivered two killer blows to extend the Arsenal manager's winless streak to 12 against Jose Mourinho.

This lack of foresight is always our undoing. The same mistakes are made every year. The same result occurs every year. Fourth place is where we'll finish because that's where we deserve to finish.

The game itself was an improvement on the kamikaze tactics of last season that saw us lose by six goals. We turned up with a plan and on a different day, with a referee who had guts, the result may have been more favourable.

What the game exposed was the lack of forward thinking from Wenger, a man traditionally synonymous with the act. That result wasn't a blip, it was the continuation of a managerial slide from grace which has seen Wenger go from one of the most revered masters of the beautiful game, to a man who is cannon fodder against the great teams.

Our summer wasn't a complete disaster, but it was tantamount to the amateur DIYer who leaves every project half baked. The rooms are liveable, but they're never going to draw gasps of awe, and every so often a window will pop or a bookshelf will drop. A constant reminder of a lack of planning and effort to deliver the best possible product.

Arsenal made three huge mistakes this summer. Firstly, we didn't address our need for a better striker until Olivier Giroud picked up a severe injury. We let superstars such as Mario Mandzukic pass us by when really, we should have had competition in place for that role in June.

The result is a very disjointed front line that doesn't know how to trouble top teams at the moment. That will come, but the importance of bedding players in early can never be underestimated.

The second major failing is one we've struggled with since Alex Song left three years ago. We don't have a defensive midfielder. We need one. The purists bleat on about the position being redundant, despite it being clear we need a big cynical lump in place to block the goal.

Chelsea have that in Nemanja Matic, a total monster who allows Cesc Fabregas to do his job. We have Mathieu Flamini, an average free transfer who couldn't find a club until we let him train with us and Mikel Arteta - a player well past his peak.

If we had a Matic, we'd have secured three points against Manchester City and on Sunday Eden Hazard would have been wiped out on his way to winning a penalty. Massive oversight.

Finally, we didn't secure a third senior centre back. This was an obvious requirement since last season when Thomas Vermaelen fell out with the manager. We have Laurent Koscielny who looks disinterested and Per Mertesacker who looks dead on his feet.

We can't make any changes because we don't have any options. Inept centre back displays can't be rectified because we sold without a plan in place. Brede Hangeland was free in the summer, Joleon Lescott was also available and West Ham's captain Winston Reid is a contract rebel.

Not the best players, but more than capable of coming in at third choice. Why didn't we move? Why is inaction always preferable with Wenger?

The Gunners should've signed a top class striker like Mario Mandzukic earlier in the summer

He should have also signed another centre back in the transfer window
