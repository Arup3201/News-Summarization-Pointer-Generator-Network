They include Kim Cho Won, a first-year teacher at Danwon High School who died on her birthday, and Jeon Young-Soo, who was a student at the institution.

Mourners were spotted weeping and clutching their faces in their hands as they attended the funerals in the industrial town, near Seoul.

Some carried treasured photographs of the victims - while others left bouquets of flowers and messages of love on the ground.

The stricken ferry Sewol, carrying 476 passengers, including 323 students, sank off the south coast of Korea as it travelled to the holiday island of Jeju on Wednesday.

Together in grief: The 16 and 17-year-old pupils make up only 75 of the 174 survivors - with a staggering 225 of them still unaccounted for. The confirmed death toll now stands at 58. Above, mourners at Ms Kim's funeral

The 16 and 17-year-old pupils make up only 75 of the 174 survivors - with a staggering 225 of them still unaccounted for.

The confirmed death toll now stands at 58 after divers - hampered for days by strong currents, bad weather and low visibility - finally found a way inside the sunken vessel.

They quickly discovered more than a dozen bodies in the ferry, while others were found outside the ship.

A 21-year-old South Korean sailor also died from injuries he sustained on Wednesday while attempting to rescue passengers from the ferry, a South Korean navy commander has confirmed.

Families of the missing students and teachers are currently in a gymnasium on Jindo Island, where information sheets are taped to the walls.

The documents include details of victim's bodies, including sex, height, hair length and colouring.

In memory: Floral tributes are left on the ground

They are desperate to retrieve their relatives' bodies before they decompose beyond recognition - with one parent saying: 'After four or five days, the body starts to decay. When it's decayed, if you try to hold a hand it might fall off.

'I miss my son. I'm really afraid I might not get to find his body.'

Yesterday, the ferry's captain, Lee Joon-seok, 68, was arrested, along with one of the Sewol's three helmsmen and a 25-year-old third mate, on suspicion of negligence and abandoning people in need.

Lee
 has been charged under maritime law with negligence and failing to 
ensure the safety of his passengers. He has faced fierce criticism for 
abandoning ship while so many were left on board.

Many students
 found themselves trapped below decks as water flooded in after he 
delayed the order to evacuate the vessel because of cold waters and 
strong currents.

Meanwhile, the third mate was steering
 at the time of the accident, in a challenging area where she had not 
steered before, and the captain said he was not on the bridge at the 
time.

Although the cause of the sinking is not known, prosecutors claim the ship made a sharp turn before it began to list. 

Today's funerals come just days after the school's vice-principal hanged himself 
because 'surviving alone is too painful', according a note found in his 
wallet. 

In his poignant last words, Kang 
Min-Gyu, 52, said he hoped he would become a teacher once again in the 
afterlife for his charges whose bodies had not been recovered.

His final note read: 'Surviving alone is too painful while 200 remain unaccounted for.
 I take full responsibility. I pushed ahead with the school trip.'

The
 note added: 'Burn my body and scatter my ashes at the site of the 
sunken ferry. Perhaps I can become a teacher for the missing students in
 my next life.'

'I will once again become a teacher in the afterlife for my students whose bodies have not been discovered.'

Mr Kang's funeral is expected to take place on Monday.

Families of four other students were to hold funerals on the same 
day, but postponed. They said they would consider holding a joint 
funeral.
