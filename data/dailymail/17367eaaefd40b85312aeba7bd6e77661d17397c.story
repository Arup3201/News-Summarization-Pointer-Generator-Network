A Michigan father thought that he was having a stroke after eating several brownies with marijuana in them.

The unnamed Independence Township man, 58, didn't realize that the sweet treats his teenage daughter had baked the night before contained the drug.

Emergency services including firefighters and police were dispatched to the family's house after the father thought he was dying and called 911 on Wednesday just after 8am.

The 17-year-old daughter later admitted to making the pot brownies, according to the Detroit Free Press.

She told police that she left the baked goods on the kitchen counter. 

'I don't know about you, but when my wife bakes some brownies and leaves them out, they're there for someone to eat,' Oakland County Undersheriff Mike McCabe told Local 4.

Her father was taken to St Joseph's Hospital in nearby Pontiac.

Officials had not determined whether the girl would be charged as of Friday. 

While some states have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana possession, any amount in Michigan is at least a misdemeanor with up to $2,000 fines or a year in prison.   

The rest of the pot brownies were taken to a lab for analysis and tested positive for marijuana.

Legalization of marijuana in Colorado has led some doctors to see a number of cases where children accidentally ate edible versions of the drug, according to ABC.
