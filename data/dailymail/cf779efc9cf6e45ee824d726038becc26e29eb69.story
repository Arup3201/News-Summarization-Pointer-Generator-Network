The family of an Ohio man fatally shot earlier this month while hunting is asking the killer to come forward after the sheriff's office received a mysterious letter from someone apologizing for the death.

Iraq War veteran Larry Bradley, 45, was shot on December 2, the first day of deer hunting season, in rural Gallia County, Ohio.Sheriff's deputies weren't sure who shot Bradley when they found his body, but got a clue around Christmastime when a letter arrived at the office from an anonymous writer claiming responsibility.

'I am so sorry for the hurt and pain that I caused on that day can u please tell the family I am so sorry,' the letter said.

But saying sorry on paper isn't enough for Mr Bradley's wife Denise, who wants legal justice for her husband .

No return address: Larry Bradley, 45, was killed on December 2 while deer hunting in rural Ohio. He was shot to death with a gun that wasn't his and now someone has written an anonymous letter claiming responsibility for the death

Confession: Around Christmas, the sheriff's office received this letter from a man claiming to be Mr Bradley's killer

'I know accidents can happen, but when they’re this big, you take responsibility for it,' she said. 'A letter doesn’t cut it.'

Mrs Bradley spoke about her husband at a press conference earlier this week in hopes of coaxing the killer to come forward.

The last thing Mr Bradley did was call his wife 
Denise, asking for help. She received the call at 8:23 am, while still 
sleeping in bed at their Bidwell home.

In the five minute call she heard her husband husband struggling and thought he was having a heart attack.

'I said, "What's wrong?" Mrs Bradley recalled.

'He said, "You just have to help me."'

She heard him choking and then silence.

When authorities reached Mr Bradley, he was 18 feet above ground in a tree stand.

He had been shot, but not with his own gun. The wound went through his rib cage and passed out of his body. They say he died in just minutes.

Gallia County Sheriff Joe Browning decided to release part of the letter in hopes that the person responsible will come forward and admit to his actions.

'A letter doesn't cut it': Mr Bradley's wife Denise spoke to press earlier this week, in an attempt to coax the killer to come forward and face justice for his actions

'They were having a hard time with this themselves,' Sheriff Browning said. 'This is the right thing to do.'

Mrs Bradley also spoke about her husband before his tragic death.

The divorced mother of two girls married Mr Bradley in 2003 and they had their first child together, daughter Riley, just 10 days before he shipped off to Iraq.

In addition to serving in Iraq, Mr Bradley served two tours in Desert Shield/Desert Storm.

When he returned Riley was almost a year old and they had another child, son Colton, the following summer.

Their children are now 8 and 7, and life hasn't been easy without their father.

'Riley said she was glad Daddy got to spend Christmas with Jesus this year,' Mrs Bradley said.

She says that while God will forgive killing her husband, it won't happen unless the person who did it takes responsibility.
