Lost his post: Commander Andy Coles was returning to his cabin when HUMS Astute headed into a sandbank

The commander of the Royal Navy’s newest nuclear-powered submarine was taking a shower minutes before it ran aground, an official inquiry has concluded.

The 24-page report says Commander Andy Coles was spotted returning to his cabin as HMS Astute, the UK’s most advanced hunter-killer sub, headed into a sandbank.

The embarrassing detail is included in the inquiry which found that a catalogue of errors contributed to the beaching of the £1billion submarine off the west coast of Scotland on October 22, 2010.

It adds that the 330ft flagship vessel, which had surfaced, ran aground on shingle off the Isle of Skye because the officer on the bridge was not using the correct radar, did not have a chart and was not used to navigating in the dark. The Navy’s humiliation was compounded when a rescue vessel crashed into HMS Astute, causing even more damage.

The cost of repairs to the sub is understood to have run into hundreds of millions of pounds.

Nobody has been court martialed over the incident, but the Navy said three officers had been disciplined.

The Ministry of Defence refused to name those who were blamed, but Cdr Coles, 47, lost his post a month after the incident.

The report said the sub was late for a rendezvous with another ship and ended up ‘cutting a corner’. Once Astute was stuck, senior officers also failed to take the correct action because ‘the gentle nature of the grounding did not give any cause for immediate concern’.

Rear Admiral Ian Corder, head of the submarine service, said he accepted all the findings. He added: ‘The submarine service has learned from this incident.’

John Ainslie, co-ordinator of Scottish CND, said: ‘The report reads like the script of an episode from Dad’s Army. It is a catalogue of obvious failures which led inexorably to an embarrassing fiasco.

‘The people commanding the Navy’s newest nuclear submarine showed even less competence than Captain Mainwaring and Corporal Jones.’
