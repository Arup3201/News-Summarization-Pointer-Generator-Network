Arturo Vidal failed to rule out a switch to Manchester United, fuelling speculation that he could be set for a move to Old Trafford.

Juventus director general Giuseppe Marotta revealed they wouldn't stand in the Chilean's way if he did decide the time was right to move on, but Vidal insists he is only thinking about training.

The 27-year old was questioned about his future after a Juventus trained session in Singapore.

He told The Mirror :'My future is to train well.'

A possible transfer had supposedly hit a snag according to his national team coach as United were worried over the midfielder's fitness and a previous knee injury.

Vidal had knee cartilage surgery at the beginning of May and was rushed back to feature in the World Cup.

Louis van Gaal continues to look for a marquee midfield signing at United but Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri is keen to keep hold of his stars, including Arturo Vidal.

Paul Scholes questioned Manchester United's transfer policy this summer following their opening day Premier League defeat at home to Swansea and Van Gaal insists he is assessing his options.

Scholes said. 'They miss the likes of [Patrice] Evra, [Nemanja] Vidic, Rio [Ferdinand] and you saw they were inexperienced and got caught.

 'The big thing about Louis van Gaal spending big money now is – who comes in? Is the quality there? The two big players haven't come – Toni Kross and Cesc Fabregas.'
