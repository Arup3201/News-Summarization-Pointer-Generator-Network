Hibs chairman Rod Petrie insists the time has come for fan ownership at Easter Road – even if it could ultimately cost him his position.

The Edinburgh club have unveiled plans backed by Sir Tom Farmer, who currently owns 98 per cent of Hibs, for a £2.5million flotation that would allow fans to take a 51 per cent controlling stake.

Farmer, whose own shareholding will be dramatically diluted by the influx of new cash going straight into club coffers, has also cleared Hibernian’s bank debt and halved the overall borrowings of the club.

The scheme, which has the influential backing of Easter Road legend Pat Stanton, opens the door for supporters – many of whom have been vitriolic in their demands for Petrie’s resignation – to ultimately call the shots in the boardroom.

‘Obviously, as the balance changes from 98 per cent ownership by the holding company and two per cent by supporters at the moment, closer to the 51 per cent of supporter ownership, then that will lead to greater influence of other people to have a say in who is on the board and what roles people have,’ Petrie said. ‘That will come out of the process we are on.

‘Today is about an important announcement for the club, it’s not about dissecting what’s happened over the last few months. It is a fantastic opportunity for Hibernian supporters, it’s what they have been saying they wanted.

‘I spoke to Pat Stanton this morning. He is welcoming it on behalf of supporters. It is something they want to unite behind.

‘It is important we understand this is a step along a journey. Over time, subject to the various approvals, there will be an opportunity for the fans to have a greater stake in the football club.

‘Together, as other people come on board and contribute to it, we will have a bigger group of people who are able to take the club forward.

‘All money raised by supporters will go into the club to help finance football activities. The money raised will not be used to buy shares from existing shareholders. Instead, the club plan to issue new shares in return for the money raised.

‘I think this is the way forward. The whole environment of football has changed. There is even a Scottish government working party looking at fan ownership and fan engagement.

‘The supporters put their faith in the club – and we’ve put our faith in the supporters. Together, we can take the club where it should be.’

Petrie reassured fans that Farmer isn’t about to remove the safety net provided by his financial strength, always ready in the event of an emergency, saying: ‘Sir Tom Farmer is not a guarantor but I understand the point about the comfort he provides.

‘Nothing changes. The holding company and every other shareholder have the shares they have at the moment. What we have done is take the opportunity for other people to have new shares.’

Stanton, welcoming proposals that contain cast-iron guarantees over the ownership of Easter Road and the club’s East Lothian training facility said: ‘A lot of people have come forward since relegation and they’ve done so because they care passionately about our club. A lot has been said – and now it is the time to get behind the team and support this plan.

‘As far as I am concerned, the plan gives people what they have been telling me they want, a much greater stake in their club.

‘I am particularly delighted that the stadium and training centre will remain in the ownership of the club – and therefore the supporters.

‘I would urge supporters to look at what is being proposed and I think they will find it to their liking. Things also look to be going in the right direction where it matters most, on the park, and I would urge everyone to unite behind the club.’

The proposals will go before shareholders at the club’s AGM on January 28 and, with Farmer already on board, they are guaranteed approval.
