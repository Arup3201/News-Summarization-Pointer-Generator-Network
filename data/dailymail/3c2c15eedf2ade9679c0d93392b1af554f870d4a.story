A husband killed his wife by pushing her down the stairs and putting a skipping rope next to her body to make it look like an accident after she discovered he was having an affair, a court has heard.

The body of Louise Evans, 32, was found in the hallway at her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, after neighbours heard her scream followed by an 'almighty bang'.

Her husband, Alan, is alleged to have pushed his wife of 12 years and then smothered her as she lay unconscious in the early hours of July 10 last year.

By the time paramedics arrived at the 
couple's semi-detached house the mother-of-three’s body was already cold
and she was in the early stages of rigor mortis, Worcester Crown Court heard.

The
jury were told that just before she died, Mrs Evans has discovered her husband had been having an affair with Amanda 
Chadwick, in her 30s, who worked at St Mary's School, Kidderminster, 
where his three children attended.

Mr Evans and Ms Chadwick exchanged 'thousands' of text messages including ones detailing sexual acts, the court heard.

Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the jury the Evans' had separated twice before he begged his wife to return.

Despite
claiming he would break contact with his lover Evans bought a secret 
SIM card so he could chat with her without his wife knowing.

Mr
Hankin told the court: 'We know Louise Evans suspected the affair, we 
can also see from the text messages between the defendant that she did 
not accept that he and Amanda were just good friends.

'On
June 18 he told her the marriage was over because he no longer loved 
her. She left to stay at her mother's taking the children with her, 
leaving the defendant in the house by himself.

'She
returned after he assured her he would try to make the marriage work, 
but she confided in a friend that he hadn't been holding up his end of 
the promise.

'Louise went on
the internet to check his phone records where she said she found 
thousands of texts between the defendant and Amanda.

the bottom of a flight of stairs when she rushed around to her home in 
Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the court was told

'She
called him at work with her suspicions. After that conversation Alan 
immediately telephoned Amanda and they spoke for an hour.'

Evans,
wearing a grey suit, white shirt, blue tie and glasses wept in the dock
as the jury heard how his wife was found dead in their home.

A couple of days before Louise died he bought a secret SIM card to make contact again.

Mr
Hankin added: '...Rrather than end the affair he and Amanda Chadwick, who was at the time 
still married to her now ex-husband Simon, actually continued to plan 
for a life together, even talking about having children.

'And he continued that affair after his wife died.'

Earlier Mr Hankin had told the jury that Evans television and phone showed he lied to police about when he had been asleep.

He also revealed that Evans had been the first person to bring up the vacuum cleaner and the skipping rope in interviews.

Mr Hankin said: 'He told police he had seen the [vacuum cleaner] when he had gone to have a bath earlier in the night.

'He
also said he could not remember how Louise was lying when he found her.
How could that image not have been imprinted on his memory, the image 
of the person you say you love lying possibly dead.

'He
was sober that night and there is no record of an illness that would 
prevent him from waking up, how can he not have heard his wife, who 
weighed over 12 stone, crash down the stairs.

'If she was conscious she must have screamed as she fell, and if she wasn't then there would have been an almighty crash.

'The walls were thin and the laminate flooring caused the sound to echo. It is inconsistent that he was asleep.

'He
even told police he had been woken up by his children shouting and 
pushing over an iron. And he didn't sleep through his phone vibrating in
his pocket.

'You will hear him go from calm to hysterics in the 999 call later, that 999 call is a sham.'In reality we know that he had subjected her to a violent assault, her death was not an accident.'

Fatal: Mother-of-three Louise Evans, 32, was found dead at the foot of the stairs at their home on 10 July

Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC had earlier set out the prosecution's case.

He said: 'This case is about the murder of Louise Evans, she was the wife of the accused.

'She died between the 9th and 10th of July last year. He murdered her at their home.

'Louise was found dead at the bottom of the stairs shortly before 1am on July 10.

'The defendant denies he killed her, he says he was asleep downstairs when she must have fallen by accident to her death.

'Examination of her body shows that she did not die immediately. She lay at the bottom of the stairs for a short time.

'The
prosecution case is that the defendant pushed or threw her down the 
stairs and if she did not die very shortly after then he smothered her 
to death.

'A skipping rope was positioned close to her body to make it seem like she became entangled in it.

'When
a neighbour who was a registers nurse came to help the defendant she 
told police that Louise’s body was already "as cold as marble" and that 
she thought it had been left there for at least an hour-and-a-half.

'Hayley and Charles Weale, who lived 
next door, shared a wall with the Evans family. The only separation was a
party wall around four inches thick.

'They told police they had become used to living with the sounds from the Evans household.

'Mr Weale even told police he could tell when they were having sex, although that had become far less frequent in recent months.

'At
around 10pm Hayley told police she heard Louise scream ‘oh my f**king 
god’, the walls were thin and Hayley heard every single word, ‘oh my 
f**king god’.

'This was unusual, Louise was never known to swear in front of her children.

'They
then heard what Charles said sounded like something being dragged 
across a laminate floor and Hayley said sounded like the opening and 
closing of drawers and banging of doors.

'At
around 11.30pm they were woken by am almighty crash. It was so loud 
that Charles got up and sat at the end of the bed, it sounded like it 
had come from within their own house.

'He said they heard reverberation from the double doors downstairs as if they had been slammed shut.

'If
we look at the pictures of the house you will see that number 112 [the 
Evans’s house] there was also a set of double doors at the bottom of the
stairs.

'Post mortem 
examinations were carried out by Dr Lawler, a home office pathologist 
with over 30 years’ experience, who has examined 1,363 homicide victims.

'There were injuries to Louise’s face,
it was concluded these were not from a fall as there was no abbrasion 
around the injuries.

'On 
further examination it was discovered she had a broken eye socket. Dr 
Lawler says this type of break is most commonly found from an assault.

'It
is caused when pressure is exerted on the eye itself, changing the 
pressure in the socket and fracturing the thin bone protecting the eye.

'This
injury would have been caused by a kick or a punch. Dr Lawler said the 
injuries to her face could have rendered her semi-conscious or 
unconscious.

'The abrasions and bruises on the rest of her body show that she was still alive when she fell down the stairs.

'No cause of death could be gained from the examination, it was recorded as unascertained.

'Dr
Lawler said in his view it was most likely that she was smothered, but 
that no signs would be present of smothering, if she was unconscious 
there would be no signs of a struggle, and you would not need to hold 
the throat, merely close the airway.'

Evans denies one count of murder.

The jury was shown detailed maps of the injuries to Louise’s body as well as pictures showing her lifeless body lying at the bottom of the stairs.

They were told that a vacuum cleaner was found at the top of the stairs with its hose uncoiled in a loop by the bathroom.

Mr Hankin said friends told police this was 'very unusual', and that other than the skipping rope there was no sign of any other items left on the stairs.

Toxicology reports showed Mrs Evans had no traces of alcohol or drugs in her system when she died.

The trial, which is expected to take six weeks, continues.
