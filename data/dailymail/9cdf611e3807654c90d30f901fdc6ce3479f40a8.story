A married couple who dress each day in authentic 1950’s outfits are delighted to have reached the final of a national competition celebrating their pastime, overcoming years of torment.

Frankie and Melanie Calland, from Howden le Wear in County Durham, are both addicted to dressing in the styles popular over half a century ago, and have suffered years of abuse over their unusual passion.

However, the pair refused to be put off, and have now beaten hundreds of other hopefuls to reach the finals Mr Vintage UK and Miss Vintage UK; a national vintage fashion contest.

Both Melanie and Frankie, pictured with three of the couples five poodles, were individually addicted to clothes dating from the 40's and 50's and when they met it was a match made in heaven

When Melanie and Frankie met in 1988 they bonded over their love of the 1950s, particularly its fashions

Frankie, 49, and Melanie, 47, have dressed in authentic 1950s style clothing for over 20 years, despite having had eggs and bricks thrown at their house because of their appearance.

'In the past we'd get abused because of the way we looked.  We had bricks and eggs thrown at our windows and abuse hurled at us in the street.  At the very least we'd get stared at,’ Melanie laments. 

Both Melanie and Frankie were individually addicted to clothes dating from the 40's and 50's and when they met it was a match made in heaven.

The couple, who source their wardrobe through vintage fairs and shops, suffered years of abuse over their lifestyle choice

She went on to fashion college and soon afterwards met Frankie at a Rock n Roll club in 1988, who was also addicted to the fashion of the same era. 

The pair, who live with their five poodles, continue to dress each day in the style of the 40's and 50's, despite experiencing frightening bullying.

In the end the abuse became so bad the couple felt they had no other option than to move house.

But in the last couple of years Melanie and Frankie have noticed a sea change in people's attitudes towards them. 

She says: ‘We now get complimented and I have people asking me where I get my dresses and accessories from. They are genuinely interested and I think it's because it's all on trend at the moment - although Frankie and I have been dressing like this for more than 30 years.’

Melanie, who studied fashion at college, often buys vintage fabrics and sews her own clothes

Their incredible wardrobe has been built out of years of scouring vintage fairs with the dedicated couple, who together run fancy dress hire shop called Fantasia, even travelling as far as America to find original clothing.

Melanie also buys vintage fabric and makes her own clothes.

The couple will now move forward to the finals of Mr Vintage UK and Miss Vintage UK later this month

Recently she spotted the UK vintage fashion competition on Facebook and decided to enter them both.

Frankie says: 'We thought it would be a bit of fun, and thought why not?  After all it was right up our street.'

The pair beat off hundreds of others, many younger than them, to earn their individual places into final which is being held at the Twinwood Festival in Bedfordshire on August 24.

'I don't know what will happen on the day but we're both excited about it. 

‘Frankie’s going to wear a grey New Yorker suit from 1947 or a brown gabardine suit from 1952.  

‘As for me I’ll wear a cream and black suit unless it’s boiling hot, then I’ll probably plump for a dress,’ Melanie says.

‘But at the end of the day we’ll just going for the fun of it.  We love the way we dress and we wouldn't change it for the world.  

'There's not much style around these days, everything seems so baggy and shapeless and it's all elastic, stretchy stuff which often doesn't look flattering. 

'By comparison styles from 40's and 50's are so glamorous and that's why I love wearing them.'
