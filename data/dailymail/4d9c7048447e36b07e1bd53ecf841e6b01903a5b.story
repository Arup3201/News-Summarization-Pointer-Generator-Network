Rory McIlroy has announced he will represent Ireland at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil when golf makes its return to the Games for the first time since 1904.

The 25-year-old, who would be eligible to play for either Great Britain or Ireland, had considered not playing at all to avoid upsetting people.

But he has now said he has made his decision ahead of this week's Irish Open at Fota Island.

'I’ve been thinking about it a lot,' he told a pre-tournament press conference. 'I don’t know whether it’s been because the World Cup has been in Brazil and I’ve been thinking a couple of years down the line.

'Thinking about all the times that I played as an amateur for Ireland and as a boy and everything, I think for me it’s the right decision to play for Ireland in 2016.'

The Northern Irish golfer is Catholic by birth, but is not believed to be particularly religious, and comes from the predominantly Protestant Holywood area of Belfast.

He has previously spoken of being in an 'extremely sensitive and difficult position' over the decision, releasing an open letter on his Twitter account in September 2012 in response to quotes attributed to him which said he felt 'more British than Irish'.

Asked if he had been 'torn' on the issue, the former world number one said today: 'More worried about what other people would think, rather than me. But you’ve got to do what’s right for yourself and what you feel most comfortable with, and ultimately that was the decision that I made.

'I was always very proud to put on the
 Irish uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy, and I would be very 
proud to do it again.

'Just
 because now that I’m playing golf for money and I’m a professional, I’m
 supposed to have this choice or this decision to make, where if you 
look at the rugby players, you look at cricketers or hockey players, 
they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf.

'I don’t think there’s any point to change that or go against that just because it’s a different event or it’s the Olympics.

'I’ve had a lot of time on my own the last few weeks and just been thinking about it a lot. It’s something that’s been quite important to me and something that I needed to make some sort of decision or some sort of stand on it.

Changes: McIroy's decision to represent Ireland comes just weeks after he announced he had broken off his engagement to tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, 23 (right)

'Just weighing up everything, and thinking back about the times that I played for Ireland and won the European Team championship with Ireland, won a lot of great amateur titles representing Ireland, I just thought why change that? Basically it’s just a continuation of what I’ve always done.'

McIroy's decision to represent Ireland comes just weeks after he announced he had broken off his engagement to tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, 23, saying he had realised he was not prepared for 'all that marriage entails'.

The couple, who were together for three years, had been due to marry in November and had sent out their wedding invitiations the weekend before McIroy ended their relationship.

'The problem is mine,' he said. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. Everyone has been through break-ups and it's obviously very, very difficult.'
