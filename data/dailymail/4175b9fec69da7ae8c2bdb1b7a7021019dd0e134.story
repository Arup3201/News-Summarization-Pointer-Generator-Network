The rivalry is legendary. A fixture which began during World War One has evolved into one of football’s most dramatic duels, helped along by the presence of the greatest players on the planet and some very short fuses.

Pele or Maradona? Messi or Neymar? Kaka, Rivaldo, Batistuta, Riquelme... when it comes to South American superpowers Brazil and Argentina, the flow of talent seems endless.

Add passion and the Latin American ‘temperament’ and this is a match with a history of tantrums, too.

Lucky Beijing, then, for being able to host the Superclasico de los Americas at the Bird’s Nest Stadium on Saturday. A normal two-legged clash will be decided by a one-off match this year.

Both countries have replaced their managers – Gerardo Martino and Dunga are the new coaches – since the World Cup, which ended so miserably for hosts Brazil.

Kaka is back for Brazil, Lionel Messi is fit and raring to go for Argentina and the ingredients are there for yet another memorable meeting.

June 2012: Argentina 4 Brazil 3 (Friendly, New Jersey)

These two countries tend not to do ‘friendlies’ for obvious reasons but Brazil wanted top-class opposition as they prepared for the Olympic Games in London and they certainly got it. Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick, including a winner with a few minutes to go. Ezequiel Lavezzi and Marcelo were both sent off for an ‘altercation’ in injury time. For the record, Brazil’s scorers were Romulo, Oscar and Hulk while Federico Fernandez was the other Argentine who found the net.

June 1990: Argentina 1 Brazil 0 (World Cup, Turin)

Diego Maradona’s sublime pass and Claudio Caniggia’s deadly finish earned Argentina the win but this was all about the post-match shenanigans, since confirmed by the big mouth of Senor Maradona. Branco of Brazil was given a bottle of water by the Argentine backroom staff as they treated an injured player and claimed afterwards that it was doped with tranquilisers. Argentina furiously denied the accusation but the ‘Holy Water Affair’, as it was dubbed did happen – Maradona spilled the beans on a TV show later.

Just to really ram it home, Argentina’s favourite football chant, to the tune of Bad Moon Rising by Cleerance Clearwater Revival, relives that very match.

Lyrics as follows: Brazil tell me how it feels / to have your father at home / I swear to you that even though years go by / we will never forget / that Diego [Maradona] dribbled you / then Cani [Caniggia] scored against you / you're crying since Italy / and you'll see Messi / he will bring us the Cup / Maradona is greater than Pelé

September 2006: Brazil 3 Argentina 0 (Friendly, Emirates Stadium, London)

KaaaaaaKaaaaaa. Yes, Brazilian commentators had a field day with Kaka’s name after the most amazing goals from the substitute. Kaka took possession just outside his own ‘D’, set off on a jet-fuelled run, leaving a certain Lionel Messi in his wake, before drifting out to his right and scoring from an acute angle. Anyone in north London that night had a treat.

July 1991: Argentina 3 Brazil 2 (Copa America, Santiago)

The tally of goals equalled the number of red cards in yet another tasty meeting between the two old foes. Franco scored for Argentina in the first minute, cancelled out by Branco, who presumably was not accepting dodgy drinks from anyone. Franco and Gabriel Batistuta put Argentina into a 3-1 lead. Joao Paulo pegged one back. Now for the sendings-off: Claudio Caniggia and Mazinho went for a fight in the first half, Enrique and Marcio Santos ditto in the second. Careca followed, having been on the pitch just a few minutes. 

August 2008: Argentina 3 Brazil 0 (Olympics, Beijing)

This semi-final was supposed to be all about Lionel Messi v Ronaldinho, who both played for Barcelona, but Sergio Aguero took centre stage instead. Former Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano was also to play a pivotal part and, again, there were red cards. Brazil finished with nine men after having Lucas Leiva, also of Liverpool, and Thiago Neves sent off in the last 10 minutes, both for tackles on Mascherano. Watched by Maradona, Aguero scored twice in five minutes, with suggestions that the first hit his hand. Aguero also won the penalty as he drew a challenge from Breno and Juan Riquelme scored from the spot.

February 1937: Argentina 2 Brazil 0 AET (South American Championships, Buenos Aires)

As the countries were tied after the group stage of what was to become the Copa America, Buenos Aires hosted a play-off decider. There had already been ill-feeling with Argentine fans accused of racist chanting – they called Brazil’s player macaquitos (monkeys) too. When the Brazil team heard further chants, they walked off the pitch and left the stadium before the match was finished. The match is known as ‘The game of shame’.

June 2005: Brazil 4 Argentina 1 (Confederations Cup, Frankfurt)

Football was the winner here, in the traditional pre-World Cup warm-up tournament. Brazil were two up within the first quarter of an hour through Adriano and Kaka. Ronaldinho volleyed goal No 3 before Adriano wrapped up the scoring for Brazil. All Argentina had to cheer was a late header from Pablo Aimar. Just three weeks earlier Argentina had beaten their old foes in a World Cup qualifier.

June 1978: Argentina 0 Brazil 0 (World Cup, Rosario)

Once again, the story was not so much the match, which was an attritional scoreless draw, but what went on afterwards. Both countries were tied on three points at the top of their group so making their final group fixture crucial. Brazil beat Poland 3-1 during the day, which left hosts Argentina knowing they needed to win by four goals. They duly crushed Peru 6-0 amid allegations of match-rigging. It was as a result of that that FIFA decided to make the final group games kick off at the same time. 

July 1982: Brazil 3 Argentina 1 (World Cup, Barcelona)

A proper Group of Death pitted Brazil, Argentina and Italy together and it was Argentina who missed out although Maradona, who had just signed for Barcelona from Boca Juniors, managed to grab plenty of headlines with a red card for kicking Joao Batista. A Brazilian side with names like Zico, Junior, Socrates and Falcao proved too good for Argentina. Zico and Junior both scored with the third coming from Serginho.

February 1946: Argentina 2 Brazil 0 (South American Championships, Buenos Aries)

Players fought with police, fans invaded the pitch and both teams had to go to the dressing rooms while order was restored in a match which has gone down in folklore in South America. The spark was ignited when both Jair Rosa Pinto and Jose Salomon went for the same ball – and Argentine captain Salomon’s leg was broken in two places. Tempers flared and chaos ensued. Salomon never played professional football again.
