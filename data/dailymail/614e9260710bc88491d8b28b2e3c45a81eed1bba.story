Former beauty queens have posed in bikinis again to prove that women don't need to hang up a two-piece once they reach a certain age.

Gay Spink, 60, Pat Morgan, 53, and Della Draper, 51, are all former Miss Great Britain or Miss UKs who say they feel happier and more confident about their bodies now than when they were younger.

Gay, a massage therapist and married mother-of-three from Halifax took the crown in 1973.

Aged with confidence: The former beauty queens all agree they feel better about their bodies now than when they were in their 20s

As Miss GB she had to walk down London's Oxford Street in just a bikini and jewellery but she said she actually feels better about her body today after gaining fitness by taking up running.

'I feel my body is much better than 25 years ago. At 35, I had had three children and I felt out of shape,' she told The Mirror.

'Now I run regularly. At 40, I took part in my first triathlon and have run the London Marathon five consecutive times. If you had told the 22-year-old that won Miss Great Britain back in 1973 she would be running marathons at 60, she wouldn't have believed it!'

Pat, from Newcastle, who continues to model 35 years after she was crowned Miss GB, agrees keeping active and eating a balanced diet is key to her body confidence.

She said: 'I eat healthily and exercise to make me feel good - being trim as a result is just a bonus. It's a cliche but age is just a number and if you feel good you look good too.

'Life does get better over 40 and over 50, and I believe it will be even better after 60. I feel much more comfortable in my own skin.'

Miss UK in 1982, Della, from Lincolnshire, now helps one of her two daughters run a jewellery business as well as taking on challenges such as walking the Inca Trail and the Arctic Circle.

She told The Mirror walking, cycling and skiing has kept her looking good - not 'faddy diets'.

She added: 'I don’t deny myself anything when it comes to food and at 4pm every day I have a cup of tea and something sweet.

'I have embraced the fact I am over 50 and am just grateful that I’m happy, healthy and alive. I don’t believe in surgery. Yes my body is going to go downhill but I am happier than ever because I have accepted these changes.'

The former beauty queens' attitudes towards their age and appearance reflects the results of a recent survey that found one in three women over 50 are happier with their body now than they were in their 20s.

Online fashion retailer Isme.com quizzed 2,000 women aged 18 - 70 and found those fifty plus were the most body confident.

Wiser: The trio all said they have grown more confident with age

Whilst 87 per cent of all women polled admitted to feeling self-conscious in a bikini on the beach, those aged 60-69 said they were the happiest with their figures.

The women in their 50s and 60s said they felt invigorated and are pursuing a more active lifestyle than they did in their 30s and 40s, and as a result are in better shape. 

The study was commissioned to support a new range of beachwear from isme.com, designed to flatter and fit the 50 plus body shape.

The brand reunited the beauty queens to model the styles that include tummy sculpting, unwiring and flattering cuts.
