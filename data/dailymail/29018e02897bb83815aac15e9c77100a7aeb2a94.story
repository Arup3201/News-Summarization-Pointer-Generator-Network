When you consider the likes of Dirty Den, Pat Butcher and the Mitchell brothers, the Bible isn’t quite the first thing that springs to mind.

But according to one of the producers on EastEnders, that’s exactly where the gritty soap gets many of its storylines from.

Jenny Robins, who oversees future plots on the long-running drama, yesterday revealed it is regularly inspired by the Bible, citing the stories of David and Goliath, Sodom and Gomorrah and Samson and Delilah as prototypes for the show.

She admitted the BBC show’s creators scoured the holy book for ‘amazing stories’ which were used as ‘source material, the whole time’.

Long-serving – and long-suffering – characters such as Dot Cotton or Pat Butcher, it was implied, were likely to bear a resemblance to Moses or Job.

Perhaps more astonishingly, Miss Robins claimed it was used like the Bible to ‘look for lessons in how to live’. 

And, in a rather odd comment given that the show is well-known for its violent plots, she said soaps ‘founder’ when they try to introduce murder, mayhem and violence into a domestic setting.

The claims will provoke critics of the 
BBC, who have in the past expressed annoyance at its negative portrayal 
of Christian characters.

In 2010, the corporation was hit with complaints of bias over the portrayal of EastEnders’ murderous pastor Lucas Johnson, who was obsessed with the Bible.

Yet Miss Robins likened the soap’s plots to ‘parables’ offering ‘hope and morality’ and said: ‘EastEnders slays all before it when it is moral to its core. The good are rewarded, the bad are punished, plausibly. A hero is cruelly, arbitrarily tested but refuses to give in or surrender. 

‘That could be a description of EastEnders or the book of Job.’ Speaking at the BBC’s Re:Think festival in Salford she said: ‘The prototype of every EastEnders story can be traced back to one source.

‘The same story shapes, all of them present in the Bible, occur again and again and again.’  

She said viewers wanted to see the archetypes of biblical stories presented ‘in a manner we understand’ which was ‘easily digestible’ and ‘relevant’. ‘In EastEnders alone the biblical parallels are almost too numerous to mention,’ she said.

But she admitted the show seemed to find telling stories about Christianity itself the hardest.
