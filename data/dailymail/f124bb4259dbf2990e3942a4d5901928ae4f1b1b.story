New York City is known for having millions of inhabitants, some of whom squeak, crawl to the kitchen to eat crumbs, and there are even those critters that live in mattresses and feast on human blood.

The dead and frozen snake left in the middle of the road on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Saturday morning is not a usual pest sighting for New Yorkers who may pride themselves on having 'seen it all.'

Photographer Margot Merhoff took some grizzly pics of the dead snake road kill she saw this morning and sent them over to Gothamist.

Hisss city now: This snake mysteriously ended up on a street on Manhattan's Upper West Side 

'Frozen UWS road kill on 75th between Amsterdam and Columbus! Why and how?!' Margot Meyerhoff wrote along with her grisly images. 

'Saw it on my way to the gym and numerous explicit words came out of my mouth,' she added.

'Looks like it was run over, but then froze in attack position, with his head raised. Belly looks pretty full too. Ick!'

According to Factually.Gizmodo.com, snake heads can still bite one hour after they are decapitated or killed which may explain why the snake's head remained in an attack pose.

It still remains a mystery as to how the snake ended up in the busy New York intersection as city residents are not advised to leave their reptiles or any other pets in the street.

Snake pancake: This snake has had better days and it looks like it may have seen the bottom of a car tire as part of its body is crushed 

Heads up!: Snake heads can still bite one hour after they are decapitated or killed which may explain why the snake's head remained in an attack pose.
