Thailandâ€™s general election last month has been declared invalid by a court, it was revealed today.

The ruling over the election on February 2 will further delay the formation of a new government after months of street protests aimed at bringing down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

Elections were not held in 28 constituencies, where anti-government protesters had prevented candidates registering - but the constitution says they should be held on the same day nationwide.

Polling was disrupted by protesters in around a fifth of constituencies, leaving the House of Representatives without a quorum to convene and select a new prime minister.

It is the latest chapter in an eight-year crisis putting Bangkok's royalist establishment and middle class against supporters of Miss Shinawatra and her brother, ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

Mr Shinawatra was toppled by the army in 2006 and lives in exile to avoid a jail term for graft.

Now in their fifth month, the protesters have shut government offices and at times blocked major thoroughfares in Bangkok to try to force out Miss Shinawatra.

Some 23 people have died and hundreds have been injured in the violence. Miss Shinawatra called the election in December to try to defuse the protests and since then has headed a caretaker government with limited powers.

The violence and political paralysis has dented confidence, prompting cuts to economic growth forecasts. Miss Shinawatra's Puea Thai Party had been expected to win.

But the main opposition Democrat Party threw in its lot with the protesters and has demanded electoral changes before any vote, aimed at reducing the influence of Mr Shinawatra.

Parties led by or allied to him have won every election since 2001. The judges voted 6-3 to declare the February vote unconstitutional, but it was unclear when a new vote would be held.
