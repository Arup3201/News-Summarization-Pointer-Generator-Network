With everything from underwater weddings to nuptials where everyone is dressed as a character from Shrek, making your special day unique is becoming increasingly challenging.

But one couple appear to have found a solution - and all they needed was a 3-D printer.

Instead of splashing out on bride and groom cake toppers that looked nothing like them, Emily and Carl Osgathorp, from Oxfordshire, used the technology to create lifelike mini statues of themselves or 'threlfies' [3D selfies] to adorn their cake.

In order to create the exact replicas each stood on a rotating turntable to be scanned into a computer

To create the perfect likeness, the pair stood on a rotating turntable in order to scan their images into a computer, using the same technology as the Xbox Kinect.

The image was then sent to a 3D printer, which printed them out, layering up 0.1mm thick plastic threads to create the mini statues.

Once complete, the mini-statues were placed on top of their wedding cake - and proved the talk of their wedding which took place at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.

Mrs Osgathorp, a marketing manager, said: 'It was great. When it was on the cake everybody was like: "Oh, my God that is you?" It was so instantly recognisable that it was us.'

The unusual cake toppers were made with the help of friend and technology expert Steven Dey, who offered to create the 3D print outs with his own, state-of-the-art equipment as a wedding present.

Mrs Osgathorp added: 'He said to me: "wouldn’t it be cool if you could have a little 3D version of you and Carl?"'

It took just 20 seconds to scan the couple at Mr Dey’s house and two hours to print their miniature doppelgangers in plastic.

Talking about his creations, Mr Dey said: 'I haven’t seen anywhere in the UK doing cake toppers like this one.

'It caused quite a stir. I guess it is something a lot of people haven’t seen before.' He added: 'I did it for fun.

'There is an interest in 3D selfies. After doing my friends and their kids, other people have started asking for it.

'Doing 3D selfies is a new thing. There are not many places in the world doing it.'
