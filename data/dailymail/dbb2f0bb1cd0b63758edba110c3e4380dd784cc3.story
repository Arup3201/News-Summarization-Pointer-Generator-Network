It’s everyone’s favourite stress release and for the residents of Charlotte, North Carolina it’s just become a whole lot more accessible.

Nature’s version of bubble wrap has appeared on top of  an expanse of water in the South East of America and there’s only one thing anyone can do – pop some bubbles.

Stretching for as far as the eye can see in the video, the air pockets of ice appear in a range of different shapes and sizes.

The video maker walks across the ice with the camera facing downwards so as to pick up her feet, capturing the very moment she tramples on the bubbles.

Exploding under her weight, the air bubbles disperse with a satisfying sound – just like the real thing.

While bits of ice propel from the sides of it from the pressure of her foot.

The frosty weather is a result of winter storm Remus, dubbed as one of the worst to hit South East America

Pop! Applying pressure to the frozen bubble  the video maker captures the moment it explodes with a satisfying sound

The wintery weather being experienced in the South East of America at the moment is due to a storm named Remus.

Dubbed one of the heaviest snow storms on record in parts of the surrounding Mississippi and Alabama, the weather has caused white outs, stand stills in traffic and even four deaths so far.
