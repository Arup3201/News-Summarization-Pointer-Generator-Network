The 'amputee push-ups' record attempt was held at The Ministry of Defence of Georgia, in Tbilisi, yesterday.

A planche push-up is a difficult form of exercise which requires good strength and balance in order to hold yourself up using your arms only.

Cpl Dadiani was watched in his world record attempt by friends, colleagues, and Vakhtang Kapanadze, Chief of General Staff of the Georgian Armed Forces.

The soldier lost both his limbs while on patrol during the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.

Its main purpose is to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and aid in rebuilding key government institutions, but has engaged in combat. 

All NATO member states contribute with troops to ISAF, as well as a number of non-member states including Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Finland.
