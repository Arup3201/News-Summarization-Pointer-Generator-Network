Hapless jobseekers are listing sleeping, watching TV and even browsing Facebook on their CVs, according to a poll.

The pointless pastimes listed as 'outside interests' also include making milkshakes, online dating and eating takeaways.

Bosses said applicants risk being laughed out of the job market and should spend their spare time picking up more useful skills.

Updating Facebook was named the worst interest on CVs in a survey of 1,000 HR specialists

'Whereas a spare-time role in the Army Reserve in which you can get paid to learn new skills such as cyber security, driving and engineering as part of your military training, as well as improve your leadership, team working and personal fitness, will benefit you in your day job and make you stand out for all the right reasons.'

Mark Elborne, president of General Electric, said: 'We are proud to recruit, support, offer development opportunities and retain Armed Forces personnel.

'Our experience has shown that staff with military training demonstrate high levels of commitment, efficiency and reliability.'
