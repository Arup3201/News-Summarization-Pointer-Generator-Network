Home invasion survivor William Petit has had a wonderful year and for the first time since 2007, he will be able to enjoy Christmas with one of his children.

Dr Petit and his wife of one year, Christine, have shared photos of their newborn son William and are clearly enjoying their time as parents once more.

The latest photo that Christine, a professional photographer, shared on her Facebook wall of the father holding his weeks-old son looking out at the first snowfall, captioning the picture with lines from a poem about rebirth.

Dressed for the season: The Petits have a lot to celebrate this Christmas, and it looks like the newborn boy is ready to help raise their Christmas spirits in this holiday outfit

'Love these two! This poem really touched me... just so appropriate for the situation, and so moving,' Christine wrote of The First Snowfall by James Russell Lowell.

Happy and uplifting family photos are something that have not been a familiar sight in the Petit household ever since 2007, when Mr Petit's wife and two teenage daughters were raped and killed in a brutal home invasion.

The family was held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky.

Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape. His daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, and wife Jennifer were killed in the home.

After the tragedy, Dr Petit met Christine Paluf at his local country club when she offered to volunteer for the Petit Family Foundation, which was created in the memory of his late wife and daughters.

When the killers went on trial in 2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the courthouse along with his relatives and listening through hours of agonizing testimony.

Last year they married and moved into a small home in Farmington River in western Connecticut.

In August, the couple announced that Christine was pregnant with their first child, and the boy was born just days before Thanksgiving.

Adorable: Christine wrote on Facebook 'Pinkies up!! There's a new nerd in the Petit household!'

'Our son is a beautiful Thanksgiving and Christmas gift,' Dr Petit said at the birth of his son, William Petit III.

'He is very lovable and sweet. I will tell him of his two big sisters, Hayley and Michaela, and how they always helped others with smiles on their faces. I am sure they and their mother Jennifer are smiling down upon him.'

Christine, whose marriage to Dr Petit was her first, has been happily adding photos of her adorable young son to the Facebook page for her photography studio.

In one, he poses with a copy of Le Petit Prince and wears horn-rimmed glasses and she jokes that 'there's a new nerd in the Petit household!'

Bundle of joy: William Arthur Petit III was born on November 23 to Christine Petit and her husband Dr William Petit

The new year is bound to bring big changes for the growing family- aside from the presence of 'little Bill'- as Christine wrote that she found a new photography studio on the river just days before her son was born.

Dr Petit's name has also been speculated as being a possible Republican challenger in a run against the sitting Democratic congressman. He has apparently had meetings with state party leaders but has made no formal statements pertaining to his run yet.

Since his wife and daughters' deaths 
in 2007, Dr Petit has retired from practicing medicine after losing his 
wife and daughters, and he has now dedicated his life to the foundation 
he created in their honor.Â 

His
foundation aims to foster the education of young people, especially 
women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic
illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by 
violence.
