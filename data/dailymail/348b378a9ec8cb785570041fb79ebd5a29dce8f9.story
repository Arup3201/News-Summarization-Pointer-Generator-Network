Top spot: Kirsty Bertarelli (then Roper) as Miss Uk in 1988 tops the rich list of women

More women than ever before are included on the list of Britain’s wealthiest people.

In a week that saw the country slip into a double-dip recession, the list also shows the super-rich are defying the economic gloom, with a rise in the number of billionaires.

The 1,000 biggest fortunes in the UK now total £414.26billion, up 4.7 per cent on last year, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2012.

It beats the previous high of £412.85billion set in 2008, months before the financial crash that has left millions of ordinary families struggling to make ends meet.

The list features 77 billionaires, compared with just 53 in 2010. It also features a record 108 women, up from 105 last year.

Ex-model Kirsty Bertarelli is the richest woman in the UK, thanks to the £7.4billion fortune she shares with her Swiss-born husband Ernesto – whose family made its money in pharmaceuticals.

The couple are sixth in the overall rich list.

Mother of three Mrs Bertarelli, 40, was formerly Kirsty Roper, a singer from Staffordshire who was crowned Miss UK in 1988. Now a songwriter, she wrote the No.1 hit Black Coffee for the girl band All Saints.

Charlene de Carvalho, 57, the only daughter of brewing giant Freddy Heineken, is the next richest woman, sharing a £5.49billion fortune with her husband Michel.

Lady Green, wife of Sir Philip Green, slips from third to fourth with £3.3billion after the couple’s Arcadia retail group, which includes Topshop, saw profits fall by 38 per cent.

The Queen is the 32nd richest woman and 
262nd overall with a personal wealth of £310million. Topping the overall
rankings, with an estimated £12.7billion, is steel magnate Lakshmi 
Mittal, 61, whose family have led the list since 2005.

Despite his fortune falling by 27 per cent in the past year, he just stays ahead of Uzbek metals magnate and Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov on £12.3billion.

Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, 45, came in third with £9.5billion, down £800million on last year.

The wealthiest UK-born man is the Duke of Westminster, 60, in seventh place with £7.35billion thanks to his London property empire.

Among other UK-born billionaires, 
diamond retailer Laurence Graff’s wealth soared by £1.3billion to 
£3.3billion, while inventor Sir James Dyson’s fortune swelled to 
£2.65billion, up by £1.2billion.

JCB owner Sir Anthony Bamford, 66, leapt from 36th to 20th on the list with £3.15billion, up by £1.5billion.

Andrey Andreev, 38, the London-based Russian businessman who founded the online dating site Badoo, is a new entrant in the list worth £500 million.

Joanna Shields, the European vice-president of Facebook, is expected to add to her wealth when the business floats.

Top of the list of the wealthiest people under 30 is Thomas Persson, 25, whose family clothing chain H&M means he and his brother Karl-Johan are valued at £700 million, while Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is in eighth place with a personal fortune of £54 million.

Singer Adele is worth £20 million, making her the wealthiest young musician.

Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and his wife have lost almost a quarter of their personal fortune over the past 12 months.

The couple - who recently spent an 
estimated £6 million on a celebrity-studded beach party to celebrate Sir
Philip's 60th birthday - are today worth £3.3 billion, down from £4.2 
billion, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Sir
Philip ranked at number 13 in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, but 
in the latest update of the nation's richest people he is placed at 17.

The Green's clothing-store empire 
includes the well-known high street brands Miss Selfridge, Dorothy 
Perkins, Evans, Wallis, BHS, Topshop and Topman.

Overall
profits in parent company Arcadia fell 38 per cent in 2010-11, which 
Sir Philip blamed at the time on an unseasonably warm autumn that had 
dented sales of winter clothing.

The
revelations of Sir Philip's drop in fortune comes after the magnate 
celebrated his birthday in Mexico last month in typically flamboyant 
style and with no expense spared.
