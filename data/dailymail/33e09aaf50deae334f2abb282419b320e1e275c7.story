New York Giants running back David Wilson is walking away from his childhood dream after being told by doctors he 'should not play football any more' due to the risk of a serious injury posed by a spinal condition.

NBC Sports reports that on Monday the Giants placed Wilson on waivers as 'injured' when the third-year tailback received a grave diagnosis after an injury in practice that left him numb in the arms and legs.

Wilson says in a statement 
released by the team, 'I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me, or pity
 me.'

'I lived my dream. A lot of people only get to dream their dream. I lived that dream. Now I have a chance to dream another dream and live that, too.'

Wilson posted a drawing on Instagram with a caption that read, 'At age 8 I told my #Dad I wanted to play football in THE NFL at this point in my life I have done that.'

'Once a Giant, always a #Giant,' he finished.

The Giants drafted Wilson in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft after a bright college career at Virginia Tech, where Wilson was named ACC Offensive Player of the Year in 2011.

Early fumbling problems aside, Wilson finished his rookie season with the Giants with 1,925 all-purpose yards, establishing himself as a formidable rusher, receiver and special teams player.

In 2013, Wilson landed on injured reserve for the season after an injury he suffered in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles in week 5.

Giants doctors examined him at the time and diagnosed a condition known as 'spinal stenosis,' where the space inside the spinal column contracts.

Wilson underwent spinal surgery in January and it wasn't until last month that doctors cleared him for full contact in practice, according to ESPN.

But only a week later, Wilson suffered a 'neck burner' after colliding with guard Eric Herman in practice, said the New York Post.

Wilson was sidelined with numbness in his extremities and missed the Giants' preseason opener against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

In a eulogy to David Wilson's career, the New York Times quotes Jene Bramel, a pediatrician who blogs about football injuries, that Wilson risked 'paralysis and quadriplegia' if he suffered damage to the spinal cord, and that in a weakened condition his spine might not be able to protect from these injuries.

Giants coach Tom Coughlin, who spoke with Wilson on Monday, called his attitude a 'great lesson for all of us.'

'Nothing that was said got him to a state of melancholy,' Coughlin told reporters by teleconference 'There's a lot to be said about his inner strength right now.'
