It is 25 years since 22-year-old Phillip Zerrillo was hit by a car and left to die outside a gas station in Cortland, New York.

The driver was never found and his then-one-year-old son, Phillip Jr, has grown up yearning for the truth.

But now the mysterious cold case could be solved after 25-year-old Zerrillo bumped into a woman who claims she was in the vehicle that night.

He was at a gas station buying coffee when the supposed witness approached him.

Killed: Phillip Zerrillo, 22, was walking home on May 25, 1990, when he was hit by a car and left to die 

Answers? His son, Phillip Jr, 25, was approached by a woman in a gas station claiming she saw the incident 

'She said, 'Are you a relation to Phil Zerrillo?' and I said that was my father and he had passed away. She said, 'I knew of your father...I didn't know him personally but I was in the vehicle the night that he was killed,' the son told NBC News.

The woman told him the driver's name and that the car is buried in a plot of land that now lies under a garage.

'I said, "Why didn't you come forward at the time?" And she said, "I was scared." I was so shocked I don't remember if she ever told me what her name was. And then she took off in a blue minivan.'

His father had been walking home from to his apartment on May 25, 1990, after staying with family five miles away.

Hours later he was found alive but gravely wounded on a street by a passing motorist.

He died en route to the hospital.

'Some days I wonder if I should have let it fly over,' he said. 'I mean, it has been 25 years.

Struggling: The victim's sister (center), stepfather (right) and son (left) are optimistic of solving the case

'Some days I wish they'd find out who did it and I could just choke them. Other days, I feel like if they found them and they were sentenced to jail, it would ruin another family, and I don't want that.'

The woman's revelation prompted Cortland police to reopen the case - and they have been flooded with tips.

'They were inundated,' Trooper Nathan R. Riegal, a spokesman for Troop C, said. 'Now they are going through those leads.'

Meanwhile, the Zerrillo family has been struggling to cope with the grief - which they believe caused the victim's mother to suffer numerous strokes.

'It absolutely killed her. She was destroyed. She lost her soul,' said her ex-husband Stephen Joseph, who was the dead man's stepfather.

'I talked to her about letting it go and she said, 'I can't forgive whoever killed my son. They took my life away from me,' Joseph said.
