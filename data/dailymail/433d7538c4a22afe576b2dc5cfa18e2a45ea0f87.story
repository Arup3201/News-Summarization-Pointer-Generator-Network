Tom has already landed two big film roles and is set to appear in 'Ted 2' and 'Entourage' next summer.

Producer and actor Mark Wahlberg recently admitted his friend is very talented, saying: 'Tom is in the movie. He plays himself, but he does an amazing job. Funny, funny moment.' 

Tom has been hailed by many as the best quarterback in NFL history.

Brady is the only quarterback to lead his team to six Super Bowls, and holds the record for the most total Super Bowl touchdown passes.
