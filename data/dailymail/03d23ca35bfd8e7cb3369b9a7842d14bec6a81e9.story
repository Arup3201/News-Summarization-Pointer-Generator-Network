Federation Square in Melbourne is moving up in the world – big time. Once voted as one of the world’s biggest eyesores, it has now catapulted into the top ten public squares across the globe.

The $450 million building opened in 2002 to great controversy over the design and costs with many describing the architecture as simply ugly.

Then to add insult to injury - the 20th century design was voted fifth on a list of the world’s ugliest buildings in 2009, alongside a library in Kosovo, a television tower in Prague and New Zealand's 1970s-era parliament building.

But now the buzzy square, which has about 9 million visitors each year, has done a complete turn-around by coming in at sixth place in the top ten public squares around the world.

Federation Square has gone from being one of the fifth biggest eyesores to being voted in at sixth place in the top ten  public squares in the world

The Naghsh-e Jahaan Square in Isfahan, Iran took out the top gong for the best public space which is lined with shops and cafes, a green area in the centre and the great Shah Mosque to the north of the square

University of Melbourne architecture professor Philip Goad said the aesthetics of a building became almost irrelevant when it came to choosing the best public spaces.

‘It’s not got much to do with the style of the buildings that surround it but the fact that it has actually provided Melbourne with a great place to bring people together,’ he said. ‘It actually has events non-stop so people enjoy it – it’s a great place to go in central Melbourne.’

Coming in either side of Federation Square was St Peter’s Square in the Vatican City in fifth spot and the Rynek Główny in Kraków, Poland ranking number 7.

1. Naghsh-e Jahaan Square, Isfahan, Iran

2. Piazza del Campo, Siena, Italy

3. Red Square, Moscow, Russia

4. Trafalgar Square, London

5. St Peter’s Square, Vatican City

6. Federation Square, Melbourne

7. Rynek Główny, Kraków, Poland

8. Plaza de Armas, Cuzco, Peru

9. Times Square, New York

10. Tahrir Square, Cairo

Prof Goad said Federation Square was significant in terms of 20th century public spaces as many others selected for the top ten were designed hundreds of years earlier.

‘It feels like you’re in a piece of outback landscape with the tiny cobblestone from Western Australia which is unusual,’ he said. ‘That’s why people don’t understand it - you wouldn’t say cliffs and valleys in the Kimberly are ugly and it’s got that sense to it.'

Other historical squares receiving a ranking are Piazza del Campo in Siena, Italy as the runner up and Red Square in Moscow rounding off the top three.

Two massive global tourist attractions - London’s Trafalgar Square and New York’s Time Square - featured at fourth and the ninth place respectively.

While the Plaza de Armas in Cuzco, Peru got a mention for eighth place, and Tahrir Square in Cairo completing the top ten public squares.

Prof Goad said the list was an interesting cross section of public spaces throughout the centuries.

‘Fed Square is significant in terms of the last century because most others were taken from across hundreds of years,’ he said. ‘So I think they have tried to balanced and generous in their spread of across time.’

However, he did admit that there were slim pickings when it came to public squares on offer from the 20th century.

'They’ve tried to find a representative new square from the 20th century and it’s essentially one of the few,' he said. 'Most large public spaces were created more than 100 years ago so in actual fact that is a mark of how in the 20th century there were probably very few of these major public spaces.'

Prof Goad described some of the architecture surrounding the most famous squares as 'second rate'.

'It's about the fact that there is a relief from the density of the city and a space to gather,' he said.

Piazza del Campo, Siena, in Italy came in second place with the Tuscan red, shell-shaped medieval piazza that hosts a horse raise - the Palio di Siena - twice a year

Red Square in Moscow, which made it into the top three, is considered the city's central square and surrounded by significant buildings - St Basils, the Kremlin and Lenin's mausoleum

London's popular Trafalgar Square got the fourth spot: since its inception by the great British architect John Nash, the square has been a source of pride for all Brits and is a constant stage for art, culture and other events

Number 5: St Peter's Square is a plaza of huge proportions located directly in front of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City, the papal enclave surrounded by Rome, directly west of the neighbourhood

Rynek Glówny in Kraków, Poland came in at number 7: the space is accessible to pedestrians from 13 different points and is one of the best car-free squares in Europe, as it is generally only accessible via foot

Placing eight in the top ten is Plaza de Armas, Cusco in Peru : As the centre of the ancient Inca capital, the plaza is richly layered with history from its foundation to the Spanish arcades that surround the square and the more modern formal layout with its hard and soft landscape acts as a healthy, beating heart to the city

The bright lights of Times Square comes in at number nine: the world's most buzzing square in the city that never sleeps has a constant stimuli making it an absolute 'eye-gasm' and complete sensory overload

Lucky last but not least goes toTahrir Square in Cairo: huge underground viaducts provides pedestrian accesses - it is filled to the brim with people suggesting its power as a site of solidarity and tool for protest
