Royal Bank of Scotland has been banned from paying bankers bonuses worth twice their salaries by the government.

The Treasury said the huge payouts could not be made while the troubled lender was still part-owned by the taxpayer.

But staff at RBS will still receive bonuses worth an entire year’s pay, and 77 people will be paid more than £1million.

Royal Bank of Scotland has been blocked from doubling bonuses by the UK government

Under new European rules, banks can pay staff bonuses worth 100 per cent of salary.

But to increase it to 200 per cent they must get the agreement of shareholders.

In the case of part-nationalised RBS, the taxpayer is the largest shareholder, and the

UKFI, which manages the Treasury stake, has blocked the increase.

The troubled bank reignited the row over pay in February when it revealed plans for huge bonuses, including £237million for its investment bankers, despite slumping into the red with an £8.2billion loss.

At the time Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned: 'A loss-making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses and, you know, it needs to continue to come down.’

George Osborne''s Treasury said it could not back bigger bonuses at RBS while it is still 'in recovery'

Now RBS has warned that not being able to pay bigger bonuses will put it at a competitive disadvantage because staff could be lured to rival firms with the promise of bigger pay deals.

It said: The board believes the best commercial solution for RBS is to have the flexibility on variable to fixed pay ratios that is now emerging as the sector norm.

‘This would also allow RBS to maintain the maximum amount of compensation that could be subject to performance conditions including clawback for conduct issues that may emerge in future. This position was understood during consultation with institutional shareholders.’

However a Treasury spokesman insisted there could be no rise in the bonus cap at RBS because the bank has not yet completed its restructuring and remains majority public-owned.

The Treasury will not oppose a 2:1 bonus ratio at Lloyds Banking Group, in which it still has a 25 per cent stake, because the bank has largely completed its restructuring.

It added that RBS's pay policies mean that the firm will remain a back-marker in its overall remuneration compared with other banks.

The spokesman added: ‘We have made clear there will be no rise in the bonus cap for an RBS still in recovery, but a bonus cap at Lloyds that reflects the progress it has made in getting money back for taxpayers.

‘A few years ago, bonuses were out of control, banks needed bailing out and the economy was shrinking.

‘Under this Government's long-term economic plan bonuses are down, the banks are recovering and the economy is growing.’

The losses of the taxpayer-backed lender, which is just over 80 per cent owned by the Government, have widened significantly from £5.3billion in 2012.

It includes  £3.8billion set aside for a string of scandal-related charges and a £4.8billion hit for the creation of an internal ‘bad bank’.

The EU bonus rules, which came into force on January 1, limit annual payouts for 2014 onwards to 100% of annual salary, or a maximum of 200% with shareholder approval.

Despite using the rules to block bigger bonuses at RBS, the UK government officially opposes the policy .

It claims the plan will not support stronger and safer banks and has launched a challenge to the rules in the European Court.

Barclays yesterday won the support of shareholders for payments of up to 200 per cent of salary, while also introducing new role-based pay awards that mean staff can still pick up bumper handouts.
