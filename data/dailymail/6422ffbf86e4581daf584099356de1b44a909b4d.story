Less than a quarter of white Americans believe hard work will get them ahead in life and two in three think the country is going in the wrong direction, new polls have revealed.

But blacks and Hispanic Americans have a drastically more optimistic view about the future, with four in 10 Latinos expecting to be their own boss within a decade.

And the minorities also maintain more faith in the American Dream than their gloomy Caucasian counterparts.

Gloomy: Less than a quarter of white Americans believe hard work will get them ahead in life and two in three think the country is going in the wrong direction, new polls have revealed

Only a quarter of whites believe hard work will see them succeed in life, according to The Atlantic/Aspen Institute's latest survey 'America Looks to 2024.'

This
 compares starkly to the outlook of African Americans and Hispanics - 44
 per cent and 49 per cent respectively think people who work hard and 
play by the rules will be more likely to get ahead.

An impressive 40 per cent of Hispanic Americans expect to own their own businesses by 2024 versus just one in 10 white Americans, the results show.

Around three in 10 black Americans expect to be their own boss within 10 years.

Three quarters of whites believe America will no longer be considered the 'land of opportunity' in 2024, while only 55 per cent of blacks and 53 per cent of Hispanics feel pessimistic on this topic.

Unified? Two-thirds are not convinced Americans will be more unified in 2024

While the 
mood of whites Americans is considerably more gloomy, American as a 
doesn't seem to have had much of a confidence boost since the recession 
and continue to have apprehensions about the future of the country.

Respondents generally expect to see a nation more divided by class and race in 2024.

They also expect China and Russia to gain power in the world as America's influence shrinks.

Interestingly, Americans are less despairing about their own health, wealth and well-being over the next decade that that of the country as a whole.

A hefty 49 per cent of respondents expect to weigh less than they currently do in 10 years time, and only 19 per cent expect they'll weigh the same or more.
