Injured veterans yesterday claimed huge delays in receiving compensation from the Ministry of Defence was like a ‘form of torture’. 

Servicemen described suffering ‘mental anguish’ after sometimes still being left waiting for full payouts three years after their claim was lodged because of the backlog.

One veterans' group said average times for cases to be processed for its members had increased nearly threefold since 2010.

Criticism of the delays comes after it was revealed that that the government has been forced to pay nearly £20million in compensation to Iraqi civilians since 2003.

The MOD said the Iraqi claims were handled completely separately from veterans. 

The MoD insisted that waiting times for injured servicemen have improved and are now around four to five months for payments for injury, illness or death caused while in service.

But former RAF Sgt Alex Ford dismissed this as ‘farcical’.

‘For anything other than a plain and simple clear-cut case you are talking at least a year for anything to happen,’ he told the BBC.  

‘It adds to the whole mental anguish of it, you literally have no timescale.

‘You don't know when the case is going to be resolved and you're left wondering about the postman each day...

‘You think, ‘maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow?’ 

Afghanistan veteran Sgt Ford suffered a slip disc during his 25 years in the RAF. He left the service two years ago to look after his wife who also hurt her back whilst serving as a staff sergeant. The couple have both suffered forms of depression.

Afghanistan veteran Chris Yates, from the Royal Engineers, is still waiting for his case to be fully reviewed three years after a truck tailgate gave way and collapsed on him while on duty. 

He suffered a prolapsed discs, a paralysed bladder, severe kidney damage and mental side effects including depression.

Labour MP Madeleine Moon, who sits on the defence select committee, said it was 'offensive' for the government to suggest a 'claiming culture' had caused the backlog

So far he has only received an interim payment of £3,000.

He told the BBC: ‘The last time I phoned them I was told my claim had been passed on to a case worker, but it's now just in another queue.

‘They said it might be weeks before I hear anything as they're completely snowed under with thousands of backlogged cases.

‘I was medically discharged in April 2014, so this is my pension that hasn't been sorted. ‘All my income has stopped and I'm not able to work.

‘There is no light at the end of the tunnel... Everything has been taken out of my hands.’ 

The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association said official figures it had been provided about claims relating to the 1991 Gulf War showed the average waiting had jumped from 82 days in 2010 to 219 days in 2014.

Labour MP Madeleine Moon, who sits on the defence select committee, said it was ‘offensive’ for the government to suggest a ‘claiming culture’ had caused the backlog.

She said: ‘We ask people to put their lives and futures on the line, the work that they do is tough.

'If people are injured, if people's lives are changed that dramatically that they need financial compensation to be able to deal with the day-to-day grind of living with an injury, they should have the financial help that we as a nation have covenanted to provide.’ 

An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘We are committed to dealing with all claims as quickly as possible but it is crucial that every claim is considered on a case by case basis. 

‘These claims are often complex and may require additional information from third party groups so it can take time to ensure everyone gets the compensation they need. 

‘Last year we dealt with around 36,000 claims and we have significantly improved our processes over the last three years so that the average waiting time is now around 4-5 months.’ 

The MoD has paid £19.3million compensation for personal injury claims made by Iraqis against British troops for the five years our forces were in Iraq after 2003.

The average handout to each of the 321 individuals is £60,000 with many more claims yet to be heard. 

The MoD said complaints civil claims from Iraqi civilians were dealt with by a completely different department and should not be compared.

A spokeswoman said: ‘It would be wholly wrong to suggest that UK veterans are left waiting while we deal with compensation claims for Iraqi veterans. That simply isn’t what is happening.’
