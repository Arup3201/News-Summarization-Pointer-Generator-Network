The SNP is on course to take a leading role in the Government of the whole of the UK after a poll showed a record number of Scottish voters plan to back the party.

Almost half of all voters north of the border now say they will support the Scottish Nationalists at the general election – prompting speculation that Alex Salmond could become deputy prime minister in a coalition administration.

The SNP is on course to win as many as 54 of the 59 Scottish constituencies, a result which would mean it holding the balance of power at Westminster.

A record 48 per cent of Scottish voters are now planning to back the SNP in May - with Labour trailing on just 24 per cent

An extraordinary collapse in Labour’s traditional support in Scotland has not been halted by the election of a new leader, former Cabinet minister Jim Murphy, earlier this month.

A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper found that 48 per cent of voters now say they will back the SNP next May – its highest ever predicted vote share in Westminster elections from the pollster.

Labour is on course to get only 24 per cent, the Conservatives 16 per cent, the Liberal Democrats 5 per cent and Ukip 4 per cent.

That would mean the loss of as many as 39 of Labour’s 41 Westminster seats in Scotland – a result which would scupper Ed Miliband’s hopes of entering No 10 with a Commons majority. Instead, the Labour leader would be left having to bargain with Mr Salmond, who is to stand for a Westminster seat, the Gordon constituency in Aberdeenshire, in May.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has overseen a surge in support for the SNP since taking over from Alex Salmond

Mr Salmond stepped down as Scotland’s First Minister after losing the independence referendum in September.

The SNP could end up in a position of power over the entire UK – an unthinkable outcome months after its referendum defeat.

Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and the new First Minister, said the poll was a ‘great early Christmas present’.

She added: ‘We take absolutely nothing for granted – and the hard work begins in the new year to ensure that we achieve a strong group of SNP MPs to give Scotland the strongest possible voice at Westminster.

‘That way, we can use our influence to bring an end to austerity economics, make Scotland free of Trident nuclear weapons, and get the powers Scotland needs to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy.’

The SNP’s campaign director, Angus Robertson MP, added: ‘The poll shows that Jim Murphy has had a “reverse honeymoon” as leader of Labour in Scotland – with the SNP stretching our lead even further since he took up the post. On these figures, Labour would even lose Mr Murphy’s seat.’

Mr Murphy insisted Scottish Labour was ‘changing’. He added: ‘We are one week into a new leadership team and really determined to change.

‘During the referendum Scotland was divided between Yes or No. But in the general election most Scots will be united in wanting to get David Cameron out of Downing Street.’

Polls currently indicate that British voters are set to return a hung parliament for the second election in succession.

There are increasing fears in Whitehall that the election could produce an effective dead heat between the main parties – with only a ‘rainbow coalition’ made up of three or more parties able to govern.

The SNP has indicated that in such circumstances, it would not prop up a Conservative-led government – but could offer support to Labour in return for a series of costly concessions.

Mr Salmond has already suggested his MPs are prepared to start influencing English laws on a ‘vote by vote’ basis to prop up a Labour government.
