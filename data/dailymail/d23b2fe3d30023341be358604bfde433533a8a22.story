The last four inmates on death row in Maryland will live out their final days behind bars, the state's governor ruled Wednesday.

Outgoing Democratic leader Martin O'Malley says executing the men 'does not serve the public good of the people' and their sentences have been changed to life in prison without parole.

Heath William Burch, Vernon Lee Evans, Jr., Anthony Grandison, Sr. and Jody Lee Miles - who have collectively served more than 80 years behind bars - are expected to remain at the North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax facility located near Cumberland. 

News of the repeal comes more than one year after O'Malley scrapped the death penalty in Maryland, making it the 18th U.S. state to do so.

The governor's office argued the sanction does not deter crime, cannot be administered without racial bias and costs three times more than maintaining a prisoner for life.

Policy makers also highlighted that a mistake cannot be reversed if an innocent person is put to death by lethal injection, electrocution, firing squad, hanging, or gas chamber.

O'Malley ruled that capital punishment in Maryland would be replaced with a sentence of life without parole.

Since this change came into play, there have been ongoing arguments over what to do with the remaining death row inmates.

O'Malley noted in a statement Wednesday that outgoing Democratic attorney general Doug Gansler recently asserted that carrying out prior sentences would be illegal in the absence of an existing statute.

'The question at hand is whether any public good is served by allowing these essentially un-executable sentences to stand,' O'Malley said.

'In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland - present or future.'

The governor said he had met or spoken with many of the relatives of the people killed by the inmates, and he thanked them for talking with him about the cases.

But he said that his failing to act at this point in the legal process would 'needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure.'

Vernon Lee Evans, Jr. was sentenced to death together with drug kingpin Anthony Grandison Sr. in 1984 for the 1983 murders of David Scott Piechowicz and his sister-in-law, Susan Kennedy.

Heath William Burch received the same penalty in 1996 for the double murder of seniors Robert and Cleo Davis.

And lastly, Jody Lee Miles was convicted two years later for the robbery and murder of Edward Joseph Atkinson. 

The four men have submitted various pleas over the years in a bid to get their sentences altered. The latest ruling will no doubt divide opinion, however many have have congratulated O'Malley's 'progressive stance' on the matter.
