The cunning game of cat and mouse between England’s greatest detective and his nemesis Professor Moriarty is the stuff of literary legend.

And it almost seemed as if Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch was trying to outwit his on-screen adversary in real life yesterday, as he took ingenious steps to keep his wedding secret.

Yet actor Andrew Scott, who plays the master criminal in the latest BBC adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s books, nonetheless managed to find his way to the Isle of Wight church where the ceremony took place.

Cumberbatch went to extraordinary lengths to keep his wedding secret, especially from the press and his fans.

Roads around the village of Mottistone were cordoned off, staff at the hotel where the wedding party celebrated were sworn to secrecy, and, in a particularly deft touch, a white van drew up outside the church at the crucial moment Cumberbatch and his new bride Sophie Hunter emerged, blocking the view.

The sneaky deployment of the vehicle was a sly echo of the moment in the 2012 TV series when the detective used a truck in the plot to fake his death. 

Scott has previously joked about his screen relationship with 38-year-old Cumberbatch, reacting to the recent news that he is to become a dad, by joking: ‘I don’t think Benedict will ask me to be a godfather. I’m his arch nemesis.’

But he was one of 40 family and friends invited to yesterday’s ceremony at the 12th Century St Peter and St Paul church. Other guests included his War Horse co-star Tom Hiddleston.

The party arrived there just before 3pm to be greeted by around a dozen wellwishers. They enjoyed fine weather but the rain began to fall when the 36-year-old bride arrived at church wearing a traditional white dress at just after 3.20pm.

In Sherlock, Cumberbatch was best man at sidekick Wason's wedding - while in real life, Martin Freeman is thought to have been Cumberbatch's best man

It was thought that Keira Knightley, who starred alongside Cumberbatch in the Imitation Game would attend, but she was spotted in LA today

Invatations were sent to guests via email because the ceremony was organised at short notice, believed to be because the couple wanted it to take place before Miss Hunter gave birth

After the hour-long ceremony, the couple climbed into a car to drive the short distance to Mottistone Manor for their reception.

Cumberbatch’s choice of the Isle of Wight came as a surprise to local residents who had no idea why he had chosen the island. But bride Sophie, a theatre and opera director, is thought to be distantly related to the first Lord Mottistone.

Cumberbatch’s hopes to keep the ceremony entirely secret were foiled when marquees began to appear in the grounds of the manor and road closure signs were erected close to the church.

The star is believed to have spent Friday night at the George Hotel in Yarmouth on the island. That evening, he joined 140 guests for a party there. Staff were sworn to secrecy but one employee said: ‘Benedict had a big party here on Friday night. There were about 140 people and it was a buffet meal. We have all been told to keep quiet about it and not tell anyone.’ 

The happy couple have known each other for five years, but were dating for just five months before the engagement was announced (pictured, guests arrive at the church today)

Several of the partygoers spent the night in the hotel. And yesterday morning, locals joined in the pre-wedding excitement by posting a series of tweets. Local councillor Chris Whitehouse wrote: ‘Isle of Wight’s gone mad with Benedict Cumberbatch marriage fever this morning. Fans of both genders flocking to Mottistone for a glimpse.’

Another added: ‘So if everyone is camped out at Mottistone church to gatecrash the celeb wedding, does that mean Sainsbury’s will be nice and quiet?’

There had been speculation that Martin Freeman, who plays Dr Watson to Cumberbatch’s Sherlock, may have been best man. But Freeman’s partner Amanda Abbington said such rumours were ‘bowel-shatteringly, mind-numbingly wrong’.

Cumberbatch is also a frontrunner to take the Best Actor award at next weekend’s Oscars, thanks to his acclaimed performance as the gay Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing in The Imitation Game.

Spotted: The pair were first seen watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June

Tying the knot: News of the wedding comes just three months after their engagement was announced in Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times newspaper on November 5
