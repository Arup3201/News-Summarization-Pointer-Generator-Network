A Top Gear fan has completed the ultimate motor challenge - building a £5million supercar using scrap and spare parts.

Amateur mechanic Jacek Mazur, 48, made his own replica McLaren F1 for just £20,000. The real thing would cost 250 times as much.

Mr Mazur, from Zabrze, Poland, spent eight years building the replica car, which can hit speeds of up to 200mph.

Taking a backseat: Despite having built a supercar from scratch, Mr Mazur is not a full-time mechanic

Drivers seat: A McLaren F1 normally costs £5million, but Jacek built his using parts from several cars at a cost of £20,000

His previous projects have included building his own Lamborghini Countach and a Porsche 911 - but the British-designed McLaren F1 has been his 'ultimate' success.

Just 106 of the supercars are thought to exist and are out of reach for anyone unable to part with several million pounds.

In August this year, one sold for a staggering £5.1million at classic car auction Gooding & Company.

Mr Mazur, a health-and-safety advisor, said ‘As soon as I saw the McLaren F1 for the first time, I knew I had to have one. I couldn't afford it so I knew I would have to build one myself.

Dedication: Jacek spent eight years putting together his supercar, which can speed off at up to 200mph

Big fan: Mr Mazur has built the car to seat three adults and one child - or one Richard Hammond

All home made: Mr Mazur's replica collection includes a yellow Lamborghini Countach, a Pontiac Fiero, a black Lamborghini Countach and a red Lamborghini Countach

‘Now when I am in my car people just stop and start taking pictures.

‘It is like being on a date with Angelina Jolie or Sandra Bullock in the centre of New York.’

He added: ‘In some ways it is actually better having a replica. The real thing is so expensive I would be afraid to take it anywhere for fear of getting it dirty.’

The incredible McLaren F1 has been built with the help of more than 30 of his friends and family.

He used the engine from an Audi and the brakes from a Mercedes.

The
 father-of-two also spent hours online researching photographs of the 
car and on blogs so that he could build his own parts and the 
streamlined shell of the vehicle.

Mr Mazur even paid tribute to his favourite TV show by building a tiny rear seat for Top Gear co-host Richard Hammond.

He said: ‘I named it the Hamonda in his honour. It is the same size as for a child but I'm sure Richard could be a fit.’

Despite spending thousands of hours in his garage he has managed to keep the support of his wife, Gosia.

She said: ‘This is his passion. Ever since I have known him he has loved cars.

‘He does spend a lot of time with them but it is better than him just sitting in the pub or doing something useless and boring.’

The McLaren F1 was designed by British engineer Gordon Murray and first built in 1991.

In 1998 it set the record for he world's fastest production car in the world with a speed of 231mph.
