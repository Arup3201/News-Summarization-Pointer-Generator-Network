Former Manchester United trainee Sean Geddes was Worcester City’s hero as the Conference North side sensationally dumped Coventry City out the FA Cup.

Geddes played in the same Old Trafford academy team as Danny Welbeck and Ravel Morrison but left to join Walsall before dropping down into non-League football.

But he will be the toast of Worcestershire on Sunday night for converting a first-half penalty after Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge had been sent off for kicking out at Daniel Nti and then smashing home a second-half winner to sink the League One side.

His 54th-minute strike from just inside the penalty area after a neat touch capped the club’s most famous Cup win since they knocked out Liverpool back in 1959.

The Sky Blues pulled a goal back late on through captain Reda Johnson, who had earlier seen a penalty saved by Worcester stopper Nathan Vaughan.

But lacklustre Coventry were undeserving of a second chance in a replay having been well and truly shown up by their unfancied opponents, who clung on through seven minutes of stoppage time.

The streets of Worcester must have been eerily quiet as kick-off drew near. Half the city seemed to have migrated and the travelling hoardes were queuing for the turnstiles to open 90 minutes before kick-off. Once inside, they created an almighty din.

It was a grand day out for a proud club that has fallen upon difficult and uncertain times. Forced to share Aggborough with Kidderminster Harriers for the last 18 months after departing their traditional St George’s Lane ground, progress towards a new home remains painfully slow. Ambitions have been put on pause.

Worcester's first goal came after Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge was sent off for kicking out

This was their first appearance in the competition proper since 2005, when they were beaten 1-0 by Huddersfield Town in a televised second round tie and their manager Carl Heeley urged his players to leave the Ricoh Arena pitch with “no regrets.”

As their 3,200+ travelling fans cranked up the volume in an otherwise sparsely-populated stadium, their team was nearly a goal ahead inside 20 seconds when Nti seized control of the ball and fired inches wide from 25 yards as it sat up nicely for him.

64 places separated Worcester, mid-table in the Conference North, and Coventry, just above the relegation zone in League One but you wouldn’t have known it.

Indeed, it took the Sky Blues, Cup winners in 1987, a good 20 minutes to cobble together a move of note. Jim O’Brien switched the ball side to Ryan Haynes, whose cross was easily gathered by Vaughan.

The Worcester keeper also reacted well to a Frank Nouble flick-on from an O’Brien free-kick but that was all the listless hosts could muster.

By contrast, Worcester were bang up for it. Lively from the off, they hustled and harried the Coventry back line, every corner and throw-in won cheered to the echo by their fans.

Geddes was the stand-out player and his outside-of-the-boot effort from 20 yards on 34 minutes had Burge alarmed. A minute later, his brave diving header dropped just wide of the mark.

Then came the moment that defined the match. Burge had cleanly collected the ball from a cross but took exception to Nti’s attempts to reach it, kicking out senselessly and earning a straight red card.

Nouble was the man sacrificed as substitute keeper Ryan Allsop came on and his first duty was the pick Geddes’ precise penalty out the back of his net.

Cue delirium in the away corner. “Worcestershire is wonderful” was the cry before a noisy rendition of ‘Ring of Fire’.

But they were soon silenced. James Maddison was brought down by Ellis Deeney, brother of Watford striker Troy, in the box and referee Ross Joyce evened the penalty count.

Captain Johnson took responsibility but it was a poor kick and Vaughan dived low to his right to save.

Steven Pressley sent Coventry out five minutes early for the second-half. Ronnie O’Sullivan was on the baize playing Judd Trump in the Champion of Champions snooker tournament downstairs and Coventry had clearly been given a rocket of their own at half-time.

It had little impact. From their first set-piece of the second half, Worcester’s Jordan Murphy saw his header clawed off the line by Allsop.

And two minutes later, Geddes blasted home from just inside the area to put Worcester two-up and into dreamland. The fans at the back of the stand performed the Poznan as jeers echoed around the home section.

Coventry simply had to do something. O’Brien saw two efforts blocked at the near post. It would have been a contentious goal as Vaughan had clattered his own defender Wayne Thomas, who was left lying on the ground.

With their numerical advantage, Worcester looked the more threatening. Substitute Nick Wright saw his effort deflected wide by a desperate block.

Both Geddes and Nti were taken off to rapturous receptions but tired legs were not an issue. They continued to press and Deeney dragged a shot wide with 13 minutes left on the clock.

But a nail-biting finale was ensured when Johnson halved the deficit for Coventry with a back post header from Maddison’s cross with nine to play.

The announcement of seven minutes added on was greeted with groans from the away fans but the Coventry onslaught never materialised and Worcester celebrated as if they'd won the Cup.
