A sex shop entrepreneur is raking in a fortune by turning out of business Little Chefs into sex shops.

Sex shop boss Graham Kidd has now turned his fourth  roadside cafe into a couple-friendly sex superstore, in South Cave, East Yorkshire.

Managing director of Pulse and Cocktails Graham Kidd said: 'The remote location is perfect for us.'

'Our sexy superstores are all about creating a fun, safe, couple-friendly environment.

'Recently, we have found a bit of niche by redeveloping redundant roadside diners.

'This will be our fourth Little Chef conversion.'

The firm already operates at two former Little Chefs in Lincolnshire and is currently converting a third on the A1 near Wakefield.

Only two official objections were submitted to the council's licensing subcommittee over the application by the company.

Neither objector agreed to be named but both claimed the location on the main western approach road to Hull was not a suitable location for a sex shop.

One also objected on moral grounds.

But councillors were told rules surrounding sex shop licence applications prevented moral grounds being put forward as a reason for refusal.

The former Little Chef premises at Beacon Service Area on A63 westbound between South Cave and Newport, with a remote location which is 'perfect for the stores' according to Mr Kidd

There were no objections from either Humberside Police or any nearby parish councils.

Mr Kidd admitted he was aware there had 
been some criticism of the location but believed there will be no 
repercussions once locals realised the benefits.

Mr Kidd said: 'We already have a very large store at Mount Pleasant in Hull, which has been successfully trading for eight years without receiving any complaints.

'The people of Hull seem very happy with what we offer there, even though it's only 100 yards away from an Asda supermarket and a busy retail park.

'This is a very different location but we have found our new roadside locations trade very well.'

Mr Kidd said the new store would include CCTV coverage both inside and out for security purposes.

He told the committee the shop would also operate a strict admission policy, with no one under 18 being allowed in.

In addition, he said staff would also ask anyone who looked under 25 to produce proof of their age.

The new store is expected to create five full-time jobs.

Graham said refurbishment work at the site would also create employment opportunities for local firms.

Tina Holtby, the East Riding Council's licensing manager, said the remote location of the shop counted in its favour.Â
