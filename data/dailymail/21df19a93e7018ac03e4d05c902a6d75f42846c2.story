The new boss of Silverstone wants to drastically reduce ticket prices for the British Grand Prix.

Patrick Allen, who replaced Richard Phillips last year, believes the cost of a race day ticket should be less than £100. The minimum price for a ticket is currently £155.

‘What I would like to do is see ticket prices falling for the British Grand Prix’, said Allen.

‘In my mind I have the benchmark of a £99 admission ticket. I think that is what customers deserve.’

Friday  - £67 

Saturday -  £87.50

Sunday - £155-£340 

Weekend (all three days) - £175- £465

Over 100,000 Formula One fans packed out Silverstone for last year's race as Lewis Hamilton stormed to victory en route to sealing his second drivers’ championship.

Tickets are already on sale for this season’s grand prix in July, with prices for a weekend ticket ranging from £175 to £465. The most expensive race day seats are priced at £340.

‘I would much rather see better ticket offers and once people are here, do more for them,’ added Allen, although a reduction in ticket prices wouldn’t happen until 2016 at the earliest.

‘If you want to get more people here every year, you don't do that by putting the ticket prices up. We are desperately trying to bring the ticket price down.’

Over 100,000 fans descended on Silverstone to see Hamilton claim victory en route to winning the title
