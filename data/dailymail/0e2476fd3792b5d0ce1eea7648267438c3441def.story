A couple whose daughter died six hours after she was born at a midwife-led birthing unit have today warned of the dangers of giving birth away from a major hospital.

Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton appeared on ITV's This Morning to urge prospective parents to be cautious in the face of the new draft NICE guidelines.

The radical shift in NHS policy is set to encourage hundreds of thousands of mothers to give birth in their homes or at stand-alone midwife-led units, away from consultant run labour wards.

Their daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died 
on March 1, 2009, after suffering a rare condition where blood leaks 
from the foetus into the mother during pregnancy.

Richard Stanton and his wife Rhiannon Davies today urged expectant parents to make informed decisions about where to give birth after their newborn daughter died at six hours old after she was delivered at a midwife-led birth unit 31 miles from the nearest major hospital in March 2009

Mrs Davies suffered complications in the last month of her pregnancy, which led to a series of hospital trips and various tests.

But medics responsible for her care, determined she was suitable to give birth at Ludlow Community Hospital - a rural midwife-led unit - around 40 minutes from the nearest district hospital in Shrewsbury.

Just two hours after she was born, Kate's tiny body collapsed and she was flown by air ambulance to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where she died at 4.05pm the same day.

An inquest jury at South Shropshire Coroners' Court unanimously concluded in November 2012 that Kate would have survived had she been delivered elsewhere, and the decision by clinicians to treat Mrs Davies' pregnancy as low risk contributed to Kate's death.

Mrs Davies and her husband Mr Stanton, who married in 2011, said they would urge new parents to ensure they have all the information they need to make the decision about their child's 'most important moment', their birth.

Mrs Davies told the show, her pregnancy had been classed as low-risk, leading medics to tell the couple she would give birth at the rural community hospital in Ludlow.

She said she was given no choice, adding: 'When you are pregnant you are terrified of giving birth, you are in the hands of clinicians and you listen to absolutely everything they say.'

The couple said while they do not want to put people off midwife-led units, which are recommended by the NHS for women who have experienced no complications during pregnancy.

But they stressed it is important women have the right to choose.

The couple appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss the new NHS draft guidelines revealed this week, which say new mothers should be encouraged to give birth in midwife-led units and second mothers should be urged to have a homebirth

A radical shift in NHS policy will see hundreds of thousands more women encouraged to give birth at home.

Mothers-to-be will be told that unless there is a high risk of complications they do not need a hospital delivery.

First-time mothers are to be advised they are just as safe having their baby in a small midwife-led unit as on the labour ward.

For most of those having their second child, giving birth at home is as safe as hospital – and far more pleasant – say new draft NHS guidelines revealed this week.

Currently, 94 per cent of the 730,000 women who go into labour in England and Wales each year give birth in hospital. Only 2.5 per cent give birth at home with the remainder going to midwife-run centres.

Having a baby at home or in a midwife-led centre is far cheaper than having a hospital birth as women do not need a hospital bed.

Staffing costs in midwifery units are also lower and they tend to rely less on pain relief or other interventions.

Studies have shown a birth at home costs the NHS an average of £1,066, compared with £1,450 at midwife-led centres and £1,631 in hospital.

Previously, NHS guidelines said mothers should be free to choose where they gave birth but urged caution over home births for women having their first child.

Women will now be advised to give birth outside hospital as long as their pregnancy is considered low risk and they do not suffer from asthma, diabetes, epilepsy or other chronic health conditions.

Midwife-led units aim to create a more homely environment and there are typically between four and ten beds and water-birth facilities. They are either stand-alone centres in the community or attached to hospitals. Doctors are summoned only in an emergency.

'I support a woman's right to choose, when you are given the information to make an informed choice,' said Mrs Davies.

'In our case we had no idea what could go wrong, how long it could possibly take to get me or my baby to a centre of care.'

The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital was the nearest major hospital to Ludlow, 31 miles away.

Mrs Davies said: 'When Kate was born it was noted she was pale and floppy and her temperature reading was hyperthermic.

'She was in respiratory distress, unfortunately it went unrecognised.

'For a prolonged period of time she was suffering oxygen starvation and was brain dead.'

Mr Stanton said: 'There was only one qualified clinician, one midwife who was alone.

'The inquest showed she placed Kate, who was in a hyperthermic state, into a cold cot and left her alone.'

His wife added: 'She was on her own, I was in another room and Richard had been sent home.

'When the ambulance came they grabbed her and ran, there were no notes, nothing.

'They took her to an air ambulance they had called. The doctor on board had no notes and tried to stabilise her on the ground for some time before they had to leave.'

Mr Stanton said he rushed back to the hospital in Ludlow, and got in the car with his wife and parents with no idea which hospital the air ambulance was heading to.

He said they knew it was a Birmingham hospital and so headed for the city.

But en route his wife collapsed due 
to the shock and he had to dial 999.

Mrs Davies was taken to a hospital 
in Worcester, while he carried on with his parents, desperately calling 
hospitals in Birmingham to try and locate Kate.

Minutes
 later a doctor called him to say he believed he had his daughter, but 
said all the information he had was her time of birth and her name 
recorded as Rhiannon - that of her mother.

The couple said it is vital that parents expecting a child consider how far the nearest hospital and consultant-led team is, before agreeing to give birth at a midwife-led centre

Mr Stanton said: 'We came to this from the perspective of losing Kate.

'It is really important that mothers have
 the choice, but we would urge them to be on the side of caution for 
what's possibly the most important moment in your child's life - the 
birth.

'We go out and we buy the best car seats to cradle them, and the softest linen to wrap them in, to bring them home.

'But mothers should have the opportunity to make choices that should be informed choices.

'With that information should come the times it takes to get to a centre of excellence, a consultant-led unit, a surgery theatre if needed and a paediatric ward.

His wife added: 'Ask for it (the information), research it.

'Think long and hard about giving birth in an environment where you are likely to be transferred in (to hospital).

'Forty-five per cent of home births are transferred in to a consultant-led unit.

'Your fall back is the ambulance service and we know that is under-funded. If you need an ambulance and it doesn't come you and your baby could die.'

After the inquest, Cathy Smith, head of 
midwifery and deputy centre chief for the women and children's centre at
 The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: 'We will now be 
taking the time to reflect on the jury's findings.'
