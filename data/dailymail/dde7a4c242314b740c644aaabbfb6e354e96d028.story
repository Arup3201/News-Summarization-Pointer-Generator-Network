A middle-class couple who pocketed £750,000 in a business con spent the money on luxury skiing holidays, shopping trips to Harrods and a £1.6million country manor.

Philip Murray-Shelley, 45 and then-wife, Margaret Jean, 43, siphoned off cash from their own business to fund their life of luxury - and continued even as the firm was falling into serious financial difficulty.

When the company went bust they turned their backs on staff and refused to pay out any compensation.

Police said that employees were told they were being made redundant without pay-offs at the same time Mrs Murray-Shelley was on a skiing holiday paid for with company cash. 

The couple were jailed on Friday for more than seven years.

Former company boss Margaret Jean Murray-Shelley drove a Porsche 911, sent her children to public schools and kept horses at stables near her manor home in Brecon, Mid Wales.

She took winter ski breaks to the Alps and went on expensive shopping trips to Harrods, funded by company cash.

An earlier court hearing heard the 43-year-old received up to £1,000-a-day in company cash, even when her employees' jobs were at risk.  

Her former husband, who masterminded the fraud, also operated from a separate address in Gatcombe Road, London.

The couple were jailed at Newport Crown Court along with two others after a three-year undercover investigation by police into the complex fraud behind their luxury lifestyle.

Philip Murray-Shelley was sentenced to more than five years after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

Sentencing, Judge Tom Crowther told him: 'This was your scheme. This was a sophisticated fraud that required constant attention and work.'

Margaret Jean was jailed for two years and six months after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

The couple, who have since divorced, ran MJL Group Ltd from Enterprise House at Navigation Park in Abercynon, south Wales.

MJL Group provided professional services to other small firms. It operated by setting up agreements with a credit company for firms needing cash to complete deals.

These small firms then arranged for the credit company to pay MJL in full and would pay the money back to the credit company in installments with interest.

But MJL conned the credit company by creating a series of bogus business contracts to claim extra money.

Not only did the credit company suffer a loss up to £750,000, but the employees of MJL also lost their jobs as money was stolen from company accounts to pay for the lavish lifestyles. 

Accountant Wayne Pulman, 63, from Swansea, was also part of the company scam and used his knowledge to hide the fraudulent activity.

He was jailed for three years and six months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, fraudulent trading and conspiracy to steal.

Andrew Wallace was given a 20 month jail term, suspended for two years, for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Holcombe, of South Wales Police's Economic Crime Unit, said outside court: 'During the investigation company director Jean Murray-Shelley was found to be living in a large manor house in Brecon, valued at £1.6m, driving a Porsche 911, sending her children to public school and keeping several horses.

'At the same time MJL employees were being told they were being made redundant with no payment, Mrs Murray Shelley was on a skiing holiday paid for by funds taken out of the company.

'They continued to trade as a company whilst knowing their company was in serious financial difficulty, giving no notice to their employees of its foreseen closure.'

He added: 'Following a three year investigation all four people were brought before the courts – such was the weight of evidence against them that Andrew Wallace and Philip Murray Shelley entered guilty pleas. 

'Mrs Murray-Shelley and Wayne Pullman were subsequently found guilty by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court.'

'This case shows that crime is not only reserved to within streets or homes, but also within the business community by persons who portray a substantial level of professional credibility.'
