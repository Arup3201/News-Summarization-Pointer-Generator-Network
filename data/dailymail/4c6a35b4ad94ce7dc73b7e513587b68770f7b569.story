Vivien Reynolds has less than two years to live after being diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer three years after being told her smear test was clear

A 45-year-old woman is today dying of terminal cervical cancer three years after doctors reassured her a routine smear test was clear.

Vivien Reynolds says she has been handed a death sentence as the hospital responsible admitted they had made a fatal mistake in reading the test results.

Ms Reynolds, from Widnes in Cheshire, has been told by doctors she could have as little as two years left to live.

Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Trust has admitted full liability for the error, but say no incompetence on the part of staff was involved.

They are expected to make a financial settlement with Ms Reynolds, but she said no amount will ever be enough.

'I've been sentenced to death,' she said.

Her smear test was carried out at her local GP surgery but reviewed by staff at Warrington Hospital in 2008.

Ms Reynolds, an administrator at a haulage company, said: 'This has left me totally devastated. It's changed my life.

'You think you’re going to live forever and it’s taken away from you and It’s really hard to accept and come to terms with.

'When I was told I had cervical cancer it felt like I was on a bungee string and it wasn’t reality. It makes it harder to accept because there was an error.

'You put your trust in the system to do a smear to have it correctly read and to be told it wasn’t, it’s hard, and I want them to change how little time they spend looking at slides.  

'It wasn’t just one person that looked at my slide it was two people, and if both of them misread it, there’s obviously some kind of error in how it has been dealt with and it needs to be reviewed and changes made.'

Ms Reynolds, who has a long-term partner but no children, feels her future has been snatched away.

She said: 'Money will never be enough because this is my life.

'Had I been murdered by somebody they would be doing time with a possibility of a life sentence and I’m not going to get that and I haven’t done anything wrong.' 

The trust says its systems are robust and that the staff involved are fully trained, adding that smear tests are not diagnostic tests and are not 100 per cent effective.

A report of the internal investigation states: 'Guidelines were followed. False negative results are inevitable in screening even in the best laboratories.'

It says human error was a factor in the case, saying the 'abnormal cells were in clumps and difficult to interpret'.

The trust admitted liability but say no incompetence was involved.

The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years.

It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb).

A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis.  Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment.

Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young.  According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011.

The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good.

The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety.

Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year. In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active.

Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.

Ms Reynolds’s lawyers at JMW 
Solicitors in Manchester said abnormalities that signalled she was at 
severe risk of developing the deadly disease were missed on a cervical 
smear test carried out in 2008.

Beth
 Reay, Ms Reynolds’s medical negligence solicitor at JMW, said: 'Once 
someone is diagnosed with cervical cancer the NHS does a review of their
 case to see if anything could have been picked up earlier. 

'Three separate screeners then looked at Vivien’s test and all three of them spotted the pre-cancerous cells.

'We have had our own independent expert review on Vivien’s case which revealed that if she had been diagnosed in 2008 she wouldn’t have needed chemotherapy, could have been treated with a routine procedure and would have made a complete recovery.'  

The solicitor explained that a smear test slide is checked twice.

The first check takes about eight minutes and any abnormalities should be picked up then.  

Any that are reported as clear are sent for a rapid review – a safeguard that is supposed to ensure any signs of cancer that were missed first time around are detected.

But she said as the second check only takes a minute there is greater room for error.

'As a safeguard to pick up on signs that were missed first time it’s inadequate,' she said.

Mel Pickup, chief executive at Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are desperately sorry to hear about Mrs Reynolds’s illness.

'We fully investigated the circumstances of Mrs Reynolds smear test report from 2008, and found that her screening test did not identify a problem that might have then been treated earlier.

'We have accepted full liability for this and apologised.

'When we investigated the smear report, we also checked all the training, practice and standards of our screeners, and found it to be all correct.

'The screeners who provide the programme are trained to the highest standard. Their work is continually quality assessed on a routine basis, and external quality assurance visits are in place to check those standards.

'Screening reduces the chance of cervical cancer by about 75 per cent, but no screening programme can be 100 per cent effective.

'National and regional quality experts advise that false negative tests do occur, and cannot be completely avoided.

'It is really important that women go for their cervical smear test when invited – more than half of all cervical cancers occur in women who are eligible for screening, but don’t attend.'
