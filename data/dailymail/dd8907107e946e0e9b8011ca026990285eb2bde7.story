In the video uploaded to Facebook, Romina Garcia urges girls to stay with their abusive boyfriends 

Ms Garcia, an 18-year-old from Nevada in Las Vegas, has more than 100,000 'followers' on Facebook 

In the clip that has attracted 375,000 views on Facebook, Ms Garcia tells her allegiance of fans: 'I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you, like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does, stay with him. 

That n***** f****** loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police or you know, he - he's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be. He's risking all of that for you.'

She goes on to say that girls should 'appreciate' boyfriends who are prepared to hit their other half. 

She then discusses her own experience of being beaten by her boyfriend. 

'The other day my boyfriend gave me a black-eye, it was my fault, like, he didn't mean - I mean he, he - he was going to hit me but like I moved, so he got my eye.

'After I realised how stupid I was, how I could have avoided everything, I got on my knees and I begged him like please "do not leave me", like, I am so sorry for what I, you know, for what I did.

'Like, you gave me an order and I didn't follow it and now I know not to disrespect you, not to talk back, if he gives me an order to follow it.'

She then posted a follow-up picture with the caption: 'Give me a black eye so I know it's real'. 

But two days later she wrote on Facebook: 'I'm single. My n***** abuse wasn't harsh enough. The next n***** I'm with better put me in hospital from all his tough love, so I know it's real!!!' 

The video was met with much criticism online with this user telling Ms Garcia that she 'got all mixed up' 

The shocking video promoting violence in a relationship was met with outrage online. 

Chandelle Fraser wrote: 'No, if a guy hits you and beats you that means he thinks you are just a peace of s***.

'A guy that really loves you would not punch you. He would kiss you instead of hitting you.'

Another, Essence Thompson said: 'There are no words to explain (this). And quite frankly, I don't care what you've got going on in your personal "love" life. 

'The reason I'm upset is because you're giving this kind of advice to young girls. Girls who follow and look up to you (for some odd reason). You need to stop this. Seriously. It's not funny, not cute, and not right. Just stop.'

Others criticised her for craving attention, labelling her a 'moron', 'dumb' and 'stupid'. 

Geri Burnikell from Support Line told MailOnline: 'This is quite shocking and obviously if you are in a relationship and you love someone, then you don't abuse them. 

'Many of the people she is targeting are young and impressionable and this gives them a distorted image of what a healthy relationship should be. I don't understand why she would promote this. 

'We help people who have been in an abusive relationship and years and years later it can still have an affect on them, on their self-esteem and their confidence.

'It can make them wary of trusting men and going into another relationship in the future and they can start self-harming or develop an eating disorder. People need to know that this isn't normal in a relationship.'  

The 18-year-old looks up to Kim Kardashian as 'she's really rich and famous' and 'she's really pretty' 

She received messages of support from her allegiance of fans who said they 'looked up' to her 

Another user said that her Dad hit her 'but her cares for me and loves me' to which Ms Garcia replied 'yes it does teach you a lot like how to handle a situation and not be a baby about it' 

But the 18-year-old did receive some praise for the video.

One Facebook user said: 'I look up to you girl. You tell how it is. Seriously my man broke my jaw (and) we're still together. It made us closer I swear, after that it put me in my place.' 

Ms Garcia replied to her fan saying: 'Swear. Good for him. These hoes out there just don't know where they belong. I salute him.'  

In response to the controversial video, Ms Garcia said: 'It's my opinion. If I had a daughter and she gave her boyfriend a good enough reason to hit her, I would think that was OK.

'A good enough reason for him to hit her would be her disrespecting him, or talking back or not doing something that he asked her to do.

'I don't ask people to share or view my video. They just do.'

And she said she was unperturbed about the negative reaction to the video. 

'I don't pay attention to it. I get messages, like really negative messages since I made that video. But I don't give time to it.'

Ms Garcia hopes her new-found fame will help her emulate role model, Kim Kardashian. 

She said: 'I love Kim Kardashian. She's my role model. Look at her now, she's really rich and famous. She's a good role model. She's just really pretty.'

The full transcript of the shocking video uploaded by Romina Garcia on her Facebook page. 

Okay you guys, I wanted to address something, mainly with you girls, about your boyfriend or the guy you're talking to and I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does. Stay with him. 

That n***** f****** loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police or you know, he - he's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be, he's risking all of that for you. So that n***** f****** loves you!

And you need to get on your f****** knees and just pray and hope that he doesn't give you another black-eye or he doesn't kill you.

Because honestly, like, a guy that's willing to do that for a girl, it's - I mean, it's amazing, like, not many guys you have out there care enough for the girls to do that. But the guys that do that they're the real like the real ass n***** and you - you girls need to appreciate it.

And you know the other day my boyfriend gave me a black-eye, it was my fault, like, he didn't mean - I mean he, he - he was going to hit me but like I moved, so he got my eye. 

'Like, he hit me in my eye whatever, he gave me a black-eye. But I'm wearing make-up right now so you can't tell but it's on this eye. I was going to go out somewhere today so he took me to get my make-up done because he didn't want people seeing me with him, you know, because I had a black-eye, they were gonna be like "what f***", you know. 

'Or whatever, he just didn't like that or whatever. So I went to go get my makeup done but the fact that he put his hands on me means a lot to me because that shows me how he cares.

'And as you asked like he hit me, like, after I realized how stupid I was, how I could have avoided everything, I got on my knees and I begged him like please "do not leave me", like, I am so sorry for what I, you know, for what I did.

'Like, you gave me an order and I didn't follow it and now I know not to disrespect you, not to talk back, if he gives me an order to follow it and I know you b*****s are gonna be like, well where's your proof, well you know well my proof of like my black-eye, I took a picture of it, it's on my Instagram and my Instagram is romina-kdashian so you can always follow me on there.

'And I just wanna let ya'll know that you need to appreciate your man and if he hits you - stay with him. He f****** loves you.'
