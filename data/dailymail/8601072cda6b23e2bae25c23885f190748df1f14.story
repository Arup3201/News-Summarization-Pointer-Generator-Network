Sony CEO Howard Stringer is to step down after six years, the company revealed today. Sony is struggling to maintain its standing due in part to its TV division's battle to keep up with Samsung

Welsh-born Sony CEO and President Sir Howard Stringer is to step down after six years, the company said today.

Sony said on Wednesday that Vice President Kazuo Hirai will take over the roles of CEO and president on April 1.

Hirai is currently president of Sony's consumer electronics division, and is best-known for the launches of the company's successful PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles.

Stringer will retain the chairman’s post.

The company is now struggling to regain its standing in the consumer electronics sector in which it was once a driving force.   

Sony has been losing money in its television division as it loses ground to South Korean rival Samsung.

Sony signalled last March that Hirai would be Stringer’s successor by promoting him to head consumer products and services, which makes up the bulk of Sony’s $85 billion in annual sales.    

Early last month, Japanese media reported that Hirai was due to take the president’s post as early as April.   

Sony has forecast a fourth year in a row of net losses for the year ending on March 31.

Analysts gave a consensus forecast of 8.8 billion yen ($115.41 million) in operating profit for the fourth quarter of last year and 8.2 billion yen for the full financial year to March.

Sony said it would brief the media on the management changes on Thursday, when it is also due to announce its October-December earnings.
