A father and his seven-month-old daughter have been found dead in their Michigan home after he failed to return the little girl to her mother amid a divorce battle.

The bodies of Daryne Gailey, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures, and his daughter Charley Lillian Hendrick were found in the Oakland County house by authorities carrying out a welfare check on Sunday morning.

Charley, who was found in her crib, died from blunt force trauma to the head and her death was ruled a homicide. But authorities have not given a cause of death for her dad, who had a deep laceration from a boxcutter to his neck when he was discovered in the home's bathroom.

Gailey's mother, 65-year-old Sylvia Majewska, was found on a couch inside the home with cuts to her body and was taken to hospital, where she remains, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Since the deaths, it has emerged that Gailey had filed for divorce only six months after his August 2013 wedding to Charley's mother, Amanda Gailey. The divorce was finalized just three weeks ago.

And more recently, Majewska had filed for a protection order on her son's behalf against his ex, although it was lifted in July, the Free Press reported. It is not clear why it was lifted.

In the protection order, Majewska claimed that Amanda Gailey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had kicked him in the groin and thrown a cell phone at him, according to court records.

Battle: Gailey was looking after the girl following his divorce from his wife Amanda, left. His mother, Sylvia Majewska, right, who was also found hurt, had previously filed a protection order against Amanda

Happier times: The couple were married for just six months before Majewska sought to get their marriage annulled earlier this year, saying that her son did not have the cognitive abilities to marry

Gailey has denied the allegations.

Majewska, who was her son's guardian due to his learning disabilities, sought to get her son's marriage annulled in January, saying he did not have the understanding to marry.

The following month, the baby was born and Amanda Gailey was given full and legal custody of the baby girl. Daryne Gailey was allowed to see his daughter every other Friday with his mother present. 

The bodies were found on Sunday morning after Gailey failed to return the baby girl to her mother following the weekend visit. Authorities went to check on him and they discovered the bodies.

A box cutter has been removed from the home as evidence, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office said. 

Killed: Authorities have not yet ruled the cause of Gailey's death, although he was found with a cut to his neck from a boxcutter. The medical examiner found little Charley died of blunt force trauma to the head

Sheriff's Sergeant Dale Brown said there didn't appear to be signs of forced entry into the home and no one has been charged in the incident.

Deputies said it appeared to be a domestic incident, but would not provide further details, WXYZ reported. 

Gailey had worked as a clerk at a Kroger grocery store in Lake Orion for 15 years, employees said. They told the Free Press that he 'had a big heart'.
