A woman who was crawling along the Interstate 35E outside Minneapolis at night was killed by a hit-and-run driver, police say.

Emily Boone, 28, was found dead on the southbound shoulder of the motorway by police in St Paul, Minnesota, at 9.30pm on Saturday.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Killed: Emily Boone, 28, was found dead after a driver ran over her while she was crawling on the Interstate

According to the Star Tribune, Boone was alone when she fell off a 15-foot wall on to the road.

Lt Tiffani Nielson, State Patrol spokesman, told the paper: 'We don't know why she was in that area at that time.'

She added that it was not clear if Boone had fallen or jumped.

Scene: Boone fell 15 feet from a wall before she was hit. Police are calling for the driver and witnesses

Officers are interviewing relatives to determine why Boone was on her own and whether she had mental health issues. 

'The family is obviously in shock, and they're going through a very traumatic experience,' Nielson told CBS. 'The family would like to know what happened last night as well.' 

An appeal has now been launched to track down the driver.

Police said the car will likely have damage to its undercarriage, and the driver may not know they hit a person.
