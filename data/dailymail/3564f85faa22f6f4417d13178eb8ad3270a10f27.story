Liverpool players had a double celebration on Sunday night as they threw a surprise party for Glen Johnson's birthday after victory in their  Premier League opener against Southampton.

Dressed in masks of the full back's face made specially for the occasion, Johnson was greeted by his team-mates Joe Allen, Brad Jones, Lucas Leiva, Philippe Coutinho, Sebastian Coates and Fabio Borini to try and frighten him for his 30th.

And, considering his milestone birthday isn't until this coming Saturday, the chances are he won't have seen his colleagues' tribute coming.

The happy snapper on the night was Borini's partner Erin O'Neill, who captured the key moments of the night on her Instagram account. 

The decision to hold it a week early came because Liverpool set to face Premier League champions Manchester City next Monday night.

They already had something more to celebrate following their 2-1 win over Southampton.

Raheem Sterling opened the scoring in the first half at Anfield following a sublime ball from Jordan Henderson, before Nathaniel Clyne equalised for the Saints just before the hour.

Daniel Sturridge then scored the winner for Brendan Rodgers' side after 79 minutes to give Liverpool the perfect start to the new season.

Johnson started the game in his less-favoured left back position, with new signing Javi Manquillo preferred on the right-hand side of defence. 

And elsewhere on Sunday night, Liverpool's Spanish stars headed out for dinner to celebrate the arrival of new signing Alberto Moreno from Sevilla.

Manquillo, Suso, Jose Enrique were among those out with their respective wives and girlfriends at San Carlo restaurant to welcome Moreno to Liverpool.

The left-back signed for the club for £12million over the weekend, and was at Anfield to watch his new side beat the Saints on Sunday
