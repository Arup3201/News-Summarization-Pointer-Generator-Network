A newborn baby pronounced dead at birth miraculously started breathing on her own 28 minutes later and doctors still don't know what caused the inexplicable resurrection.

Robin Cyr, 34, gave birth to her fourth child early Saturday morning in Halifax, Nova Scotia but was soon after told the baby girl hadn't survived after being wedged in the birth canal during delivery.

For 25 minutes, Cyr waited for a sign of life but began to give up hope.

Miracle baby: Robin Cyr's newborn daughter was pronounced dead at birth after a difficult delivery but unexpectedly started breathing on her own 28 minutes later

'My aunt looked at me and said, "Your baby girl’s gone,"' Cyr told reporter Ruth Davenport of Metro Halifax.

The baby was taken from the room, but just a few minutes later a nurse came back in, speechless.

That's when another nurse stepped in and said, 'You're baby's breathing'.

'My aunt was there, and it’s a blessing because her prayers are very deep and strong,' Cyr said.  'When she started praying, my baby came back.'

Not even the surgeon could explain what caused Cyr's baby to resurrect.

Back to life: Cyr's nine-pound, 14 ounce daughter is now breathing on her own in the neonatal intensive care unit at a Halifax hospital

'He said it’s a miracle,' said Cyr. 'He said, ‘I’m very sorry I gave up on your baby when I did, because I turned around and she’s breathing on her own."'

Cyr's nine pound, 14-ounce baby is recovering well and breathing on her own in the neonatal intensive care unit.

While Cyr already had a name in mind for the baby, she is considering changing it to something more meaningful.

'Everybody just keeps saying, Miracle, Miracle,' she said.

Namesake: Cyr had a name planned for her fourth child, but is now considering naming the girl 'Miracle'
