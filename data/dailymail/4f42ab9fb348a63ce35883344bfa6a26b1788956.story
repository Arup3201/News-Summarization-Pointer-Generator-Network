Former French President and pop singer wife Carla Bruni gave America's first couple more than $40,000 worth of gifts in a single year, it emerged today.

Presents included a designer Hermes golf bag and Baccarat crystal statuettes of players, according to newly released records.

The incredible generosity will not only further the Sarkozy's Bling-Bling reputation, but confirm that he presided over one of the most spendthrift presidencies in French history.

Extravagant: In one year, Sarkozy gave his American counterpart designer gifts worth $41k

Mr Sarkozy has been accused of accepting millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the L'Oreal heiress and France's richest woman, and deposed Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi.

Now a list of presents given to US President Barak Obama released by the US State Department confirms that Mr Sarkozy was never afraid to spend taxpayers' cash too.

In 2011, he gave his American counterpart a Hermes designer golf had valued at $7,750 and the Baccarat statues depicting golfers at play.

The total amount of gifts given to the 
Obamas by Mr Sarkozy and Miss Bruni, who still uses her maiden name in 
her music career, was $41,675.71 in 2011 alone.

Each gift was accepted, because rejecting the gift would 'cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. Government,' said an American government spokesman.

All
 federal employees in the United States must declare gifts from foreign 
governments or organisations with gifts to the president or the first 
family turned over to the National Archives.

They used to spend more than $1,000 a day on flowers, and had a bread-making oven installed in their official plane.

Such luxury contributed greatly to Mr Sarkozy's unpopularity, and he was rejected by voters after just one term in office last year.

He and his lawyers are now dealing with a number of criminal inquiries which could end up with him getting a prison sentence.
