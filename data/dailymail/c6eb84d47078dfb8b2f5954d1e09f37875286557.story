As bow ties are plumped and hair is coiffed for this evening’s First Night of the Proms, an orchestra will be preparing to play Elgar’s biblical oratorio The Kingdom.

But that isn’t the only curtain raiser, for today the home where Edward Elgar composed some of his finest pieces goes on the market for £2.25 million.

The 18th century four-bedroom house just outside of Bray in Berkshire saw Elgar labour over the oratorio and part of his Cello Concerto.

Historic: the swimming pool was formerly the music room where English composer Elgar wrote his Cello Concerto and The Kingdom

A historic blue plaque marks the gated entrance to the Berkshire mansion where Elgar composed music. The home belonged to his close friend Frank Schuster, a patron of the arts

A historic blue plaque by the gated entrance marks his time in the mansion, stating that ‘he often stayed and composed in this house’.

The present resident is Pauline Turner, a humanist celebrant who has been there for five years.

Earlier, the home was owned by Miss Van de Weyer, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria who regularly stopped by for afternoon tea.

The sale of the home will likely cause a sit among Elgar fans, who have visited the mansion over the years to see where he worked.

Sir Edward William Elgar was an an English composer who achieved international fame in the classical music arena.

His best known compositions include the Enigma Variations and the Pomp and Circumstance Marches concertos for violin and cello.

Born on June 2 , 1857, Elgar was  the son of a music shopkeeper and piano tuner in provincial Worcester, and brought up as a Catholic.

He received practical training as a performer on the violin and other instruments, and taught himself composition.

In Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion and he became an outsider.

He did however attain national prominence in 1899 when his ‘Enigma’ Variations premiered in London. His next major work, the oratorio The Dream of Gerontius, quickly became successful in Britain and Germany.

A decade followed which saw the composition of two further oratorios, The Apostles and The Kingdom and a stream of orchestral works culminating in the First Symphony and the Violin Concerto. When his wife died, Elgar, who had been living in London, moved back to the West Midlands.

He was working with renewed energy on an opera and a Third Symphony when he died in 1934.

There was 
the time when a crew of Norwegian sailors arrived, out of the blue and 
via the river Thames, dressed in naval costumes.

They
 sang Rule, Britannia! and staged a trumpet call outside what was the 
music room , then toasted the moment with shots of schnapps.

As they left the house via the Thames on their rowing barge they raised their oars in salute as they sailed past.

Elgar 
would sit in the music room, which is now the swimming pool, and compose
 music that he would perform in front of an audience that included 
Gabriel Faure, George Bernard Shaw, Dame Nellie Melba, Siegfried Sassoon
 and Arnold Benett.

The property, called Long White Cloud, which was owned by Eldgar’s close friend Frank Schuster, was a regular haunt of the legendary composer in the early 20th century.

In 1906 he came up with The Kingdom and, four years later, worked on his Violin Concerto.

The house was named Long White Cloud, which is the Maori name for New Zealand, by a more recent resident, Stirling Moss.

Mr Moss, 84, is a former Formula One racing driver from England.

Stirling Moss, 84, is a former Formula One driver who raced for England. He was a top racer but never quite managed to get it over the line, becoming known as 'the greatest driver to never win the World Championship' by sports commentators.

Moss was raised in Long White Cloud by his father Alfred, who was a dentist, and his mother Aileen.

His sister Pat was also gifted behind the wheel and she became a successful rally driver.

Moss, who raced from 1948 to 1962, won 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 Formula One Grand Prix.

He would compete in as many as 62 races in a single year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his racing career, including Cooper 500, ERA, Lotus, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Aston Martin, Maserati, Ferrari and Jaguar.

He remained the English driver with the most Formula One victories until 1991 when Nigel Mansell overtook him after competing in more races.

He now lives in West Kensington, London.

It was his family home and he drove his first racing car around the track in the grounds of the property as a boy.

The Mosses owned the home until 1959 and in 1963 the estate was sold and split up into two homes.

Spread across 4,840 sq ft, it has five bedrooms, four reception rooms, an indoor swimming pool and a 32ft drawing room.

It still contains many of the original features including leaded light windows and ornate fireplaces.

Fiona Copeman, an associate director at Savills estate agents, said: ‘Long White Cloud is a historic home set within idyllic riverside gardens.

‘We've had quite a lot of interest in the property and already had six viewings. It is a lovely family home and is in Bray, which didn't flood last year.’
