Homeland Security
Secretary Jeh Johnson on Tuesday defended to Congress the Obama
administration's decision to allow millions of illegal immigrants relief from deportation even as conservatives on Capitol Hill aggressively pushed to defund parts of his department.

Johnson spoke at a hearing before the House Committee on
Homeland Security that marked the first public hearing on President Barack Obama's
executive actions, which are expected to allow as many as five million immigrants to remain in the United States indefinitely, since he announced them late last month.

The DHS head begged lawmakers today not to express their anger at the president and the administration over immigration through the appropriations process.

Johnson told them he could not run his department with the type of short-term spending bill that conservatives on Capitol Hill are considering.

'That is in my judgement a very bad idea for Homeland Security because during that period of a continuing resolution we cannot engage in new starts,' he told them. 'We've got some Homeland Security priorities that need to be funded now. 

The department head pointed out that a new presidential election cycle is about to being and he wouldn't be able to hire new Secret Service agents to protect candidates until DHS is fully funded for the entire fiscal year. 

Furthermore, he said he wouldn't be able to fund 'our enhanced detention capability in Texas with another continuing resolution that gets me to March.'

'I need the help of Congress to support and build upon border security, which I believe all of you support,' he said.

'So, I'm urging that we act on our current appropriations request now for the purpose and for the sake of border security and homeland security,' Johnson concluded.

Republicans in the House and Senate who are deeply opposed to providing amnesty to illegal immigrants have been lobbying their colleagues to pass appropriations legislation that would only fund the Department of Homeland Security through early 2015, when they take control of both chambers of Congress.

At that time they would be able to insert language into a long-term spending bill that would hinge funding for certain immigration agencies and operations on ceasing implementation of Obama's immigration actions. 

House Speaker John Boehner reportedly endorsed the plan in a closed-door meeting today, setting up his party's attempt to block the president's immigration policy in January and a head-to-head fight with the White House. 

At a press briefing afterward he said his conference had not coalesced around a specific plan yet, however.

'I said before Thanksgiving that Republicans would fight his unilateral actions,' the GOP leader said. 

'We’re looking at a variety of options, both for right now and when Republicans control both Houses of the Congress next year. And we’ll continue to discuss with our members a number of options, in terms of how we will deal with this, in consultation, again, with the members.

'But no decisions have been made at this point,' he added.

If Congress doesn't pass new spending legislation by Dec. 11 the federal government will shut down until it does.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant that won't happen, saying again today a shut down is not in the cards.

However, he confirmed that Republicans, who are currently the minority in the Senate, would support whatever bill their colleagues in the House sent over.

'In the short-term, the Senate will be in a reactive role, he said. 'Next year, we'll be sort-of more co-equal partners on that issue. 

'But right now, our view is once it's sorted out in the House, once it gets passed, I'll be supportive of that.'

The White House has made its preference that legislators pass a yearlong spending bill for all government agencies known several times over.

Certainty is good for the economy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said today.

'Were hopeful that Republicans will follow their own advice in that regard and pass a full-year fed budget,' he added.

Earnest said White House officials 'certainly take some heart' in McConnell's promises that there will not be a government shutdown next week.

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said after a  House Republican caucus meeting at the Capitol today that his members had not yet determined how it planned to avoid another politically damaging shutdown while holding the president accountable for his immigration actions

Republicans on Capitol Hill unleashed their fury over the immigration actions today at Johnson.

Regardless of where you stand on the issue, there’s a right way to do this and a wrong way,' the committee's chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul said. 'This is not how democracy works.'

Johnson told the committee he recommended each
action Obama took and continues to stand behind them.

'The reality is that, given our limited resources, these
people are not priorities for removal,' he said.

McCaul, a Republican, said the president's directive would be perceived as
amnesty to those considering crossing the U.S.  border with Mexico, though.

'If we don't think that message is making its way back to
Mexico and Central America, we are simply fooling ourselves,' he said.

'We will see a wave of illegal immigration because
of the president's actions.'

Johnson said the new measures are not amnesty. 'The current situation is amnesty,' he said

Furthermore, he said administration officials 'feel that we had no choice' to act given that Congress couldn't come to an agreement on comprehensive reform of its own.

McCaul argued that Obama did not have the authority to authorize the order, however.

In response, Johnson defended the legality of the action, saying those
who drafted the plan worked closely with the Justice
Department's Office of Legal Counsel.

'I’m satisfied as a lawyer myself — and the person who has to come here and defend these actions — that what we have done is well within our existing legal authority,' he told the committee.

The White House said today it was not surprised that the GOP tore into Johnson.

'Republicans have long...adopted the view - that's contrary to the view of the vast majority of Americans - that we shouldnt reform our broken immigration system,' he said.

Their views on immigration are 'stark contrasts' to those of the president, law enforcement officials, faith leaders, and even some of their fellow Republicans, he added.

Later in his briefing on Tuesday Earnest told reporters, 'the fact is the closest thing we have to amnesty in this country is doing nothing.' And that's exactly what Republicans seem to be doing, he charged.
