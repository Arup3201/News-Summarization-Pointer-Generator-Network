An Egyptian court today sentenced 21 people to death after they were involved in a riot following a football match in which 74 people were killed.

The controversial verdict prompted further bloodshed, as 30 people were killed during reactionary riots outside the Mediterranean city of Port Said's main jail today.

The unrest is part of a wave of violence that has swept Egypt, leaving a total of
 38 people dead in two days.

Today, Britain called for 'maximum restraint' and strongly condemned the violence.

On Friday, 11 people were killed in clashes between 
police and protesters who were marking the second anniversary of the 
uprising that overthrew longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.

President Mohammed Morsi canceled a 
scheduled trip to Ethiopia Saturday and instead met for the first time 
with top generals as part of the newly formed National Defense Council.

The violence in Port Said followed 
the court decision when angry relatives of those sentenced tried to 
storm the prison to free the defendants, shooting dead two police 
officers, according to reports.

Egyptian
 security officials said the military had been deployed to the city, 
where most of those sentenced are from, as police became embroiled in 
violent clashes with protestors.

Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at those demonstrating, who feel aggrieved that they are shouldering the blame for the riots.

The violence during the match last year was the world's worst football related disaster in 15 years.

Fans of Al-Ahly, whose stands were 
attacked by rival club Al-Masry in the 
Mediterranean city of Port Said, had promised more violence if the 
accused did not receive death sentences.

Families of the those killed during the disorder wailed in the courtroom as the judge gave the sentence, while some shouted 'Allahu Akbar' - Arabic for God is great

One man fainted, while others wailed and cried in disbelief as they carried pictures of the young men killed in the soccer riot.

Sentencing: The judge will sentence a further 52 people, charged in connection with the riots, in March

The judge said in his statement, read 
live on state TV, that he would announce the verdict for the remaining 
52 defendants at a later date.

While many of those on trial included alleged football hooligans, nine security officials also face charges.

The death sentences will be sent to a top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for approval, as is customary in Egypt.

Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said the violence which has been seen in the past two days 'can have no place in a truly democratic Egypt'.

'I am deeply concerned by reports of violent clashes resulting in a 
number of deaths and injuries, following demonstrations to mark the 
second anniversary of the 25 January revolution and the verdict in the 
Port Said court case today,' he said.

'This cannot help the process of dialogue which we encourage as vital 
for Egypt today, and we must condemn the violence in the strongest 
terms.

Desperation: Thousands of desperate supporters trying to board a train after fleeing from the stadium

'We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to ensure that
 all protests remain peaceful. I offer the condolences of the UK to the 
families of all the victims.'

The UK remained 'committed as a strong friend of Egypt and the Egyptian 
people to support the aim of strengthening true democracy', he went on.

'The right to peaceful freedom of expression and assembly is an 
essential part of this, but the violence we have seen today can have no 
place in a truly democratic Egypt.'

Many violent soccer fans, known as Ultras, have taken a leading role in protests over the past two years.

Both
 Al-Ahly Ultras and Al-Masry Ultras widely believe that ex-members of 
the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak helped instigate the attack.

The police are also accused of gross negligence over their handling of the incident.

Revenge: Fans of al-Ahly had promised more violence if the accused did not receive death sentences

It is not clear what kind of 
evidence, if any, was presented to the court to back up claims that the 
attack had been orchestrated by regime officials.

All of the defendants - who were not 
present in the courtroom today for security reasons - have the right to 
appeal against the verdict.

The clashes occurred during a match between Port Said's Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly, the country's most successful club, on February 1 last year.

The final whistle prompted more than 
13,000 home fans, armed with knives, iron bars and machetes, to storm 
the pitch and attack rival Al-Ahly players and their 1,200 supporters.

Authorities shut off the stadium lights after the game, plunging it into darkness.

In the exit corridor, the fleeing 
crowd pressed against a chained gate until it broke open. Many were 
crushed under the crowd of people trying to flee.

In the days leading up to the 
verdict, Al-Ahly fans warned of bloodshed and 'retribution' if death 
sentences were not handed down.

Hundreds of Al-Ahly fans gathered 
outside the Cairo sports club in anticipation of the verdict, chanting 
against the police and the government.

While there has long been bad blood 
between the two rival teams, many blamed police for failing to perform 
usual searches for weapons at the stadium.

The Ultras, 
are among Egypt's rowdiest and are proud of their hatred for the police,
 who were the backbone of Mubarak's authoritarian rule.

The Ultras from Egypt's sports clubs 
were engaged in deadly clashes with police near the Interior Ministry 
headquarters in Cairo that killed 42 people less than three months 
before the soccer melee in Port Said.
