The daughter of singer Eartha Kitt has revealed that she never got over not knowing who her white father was.

Kitt Shapiro, 51, described how her mother 'carried the scar of her rejection' throughout her life by both black and white people.

Even when she died in 2008 she did not know who her father was because his name had been censored on a birth certificate given to her 10 years earlier - the first time she learned of her real date of birth.

Kitt was 71 when she was given the document but broke down in tears when her lifelong dream of knowing the identity of her father was shattered.

This, Shapiro believes, was because he was white and officials wanted to protect him.

'It was approaching the 21st century and yet they were still 
protecting the name of the father even though he was clearly dead,' Shapiro, Kitt's only child told the Observer.

'To some extent, I think my arrival completed her because it gave her a family that she never had,' she says.

Kitt's mother abandoned her when she was a young child and she was raised by various brutal aunts and
 never forgot 'the beatings, the domestic drudgery, the constant 
hunger.'

On one occasion, she was tied to a tree and whipped by Aunt 
Rosa 'till the blood ran down her legs.'

Soon afterwards, her mother, 
Annie Mae Keitt, mysteriously died after eating food 'sprinkled with an 
unusual pepper', although there was never any mention of who might have been responsible for the poisoning.

The
 next we know, like an episode in a torrid novel, 'a miraculous event' 
occurs and an Auntie Mamie invites Eartha to live with her in New York.

At school in Harlem, Eartha 'acquired a reputation for her singing 
ability' - and this was the era of Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway and 
'the swanky Cotton Club,' of speakeasies and bars, with 'its mix of 
Latin, West Indian and African-American cultures.'

Eartha
 soon quarrelled with her guardian, and after another routine beating, 
moved out. 'She found herself a job in a sweatshop as a seamstress and a
 room with a Cuban family in the Bronx.' She was soon engaged by a dance
 troupe, where she gained notice.

After dance school, Kitt sought to make a solo career for herself and Britain became a second home for her and her daughter.

It was only when Kitt was invited to give a speech at Benedict College in Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, in 1997 that the singer managed to come to terms with her original home.

During that same speech an attendee asked Kitt about her past and about her parents, as she was from that part of town. Kitt then confessed she had tried to find her birth certificate in the 50s, but had no luck. This re-ignited Kitt's curiosity about herself.

After some digging around, a piece of information led her back down to the South. In the next seven months, Kitt and Shapiro hired a lawyer and started a petition to get the court to open her records. They finally allowed Kitt to see them, but only for 15 minutes. The pair flew down.

'She was very nervous and outside the judge's chambers she went quiet. She was visibly nervous about what she was going to see... It was a female judge who stepped aside while we read the records on her desk. The father's name was blacked out. My mother shed a few tears and then the 15 minutes was up,' says Shapiro, who worked for her mother for more than 20 years.

On that day it was also revealed Kitt had never known her birth date. While she has always put January 26 1926 on her passport, the certificate revealed she was actually a year younger, born January 17 1927.

Shapiro says her mother never really 
felt comfortable in her own skin because she never really knew who she 
was until then. She believes that this failure to find out her mother's 
origins explains her tortured relationship with the South and her own 
identity.

Eartha Kitt passed away on Christmas Day 2008, never knowing her father's name

At that time, 
being a light-skinned black person in the black South was 'just as bad' 
as black person in the white South. Kitt was not accepted by the black 
community and was referred to as a 'yellow gal' (someone who thought they were better than everyone else) from a child.

For Eartha, born in 1927 in 'a 
ramshackle arrangement of backwoods shacks' in the South Carolina cotton
 fields, being born black or of mixed race was like being a Jew in Nazi 
Germany. You were not quite human.

Eartha,
 indeed, had not thought of herself as 'coloured' until she was made to 
enter restaurants by the back door. Even in the Sixties she had 
difficulty buying property in Hollywood, because Bel Air and Beverly 
Hills were neighbourhoods that 'didn’t welcome African-American 
home-owners.'

When her close
 friend Sammy Davis Jr. used a hotel swimming pool, it was 'drained and 
scrubbed by a cleaning crew the next morning.'

Eartha’s
 parentage was uncertain. Her father was white - but who was he? 
Possibly one of the Keitt family, 'the former slave owners,' or, far 
more likely, a recently bereaved local doctor called Daniel Sturkie.

Indeed, John Williams, the author of a biography called America's Mistress: Eartha Kitt, Her Life and Times, believed Kitt's father was Sturkie, though Shapiro says 'there were a lot of names'.
