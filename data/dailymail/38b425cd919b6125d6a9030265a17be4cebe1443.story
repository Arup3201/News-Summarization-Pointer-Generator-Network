If I’m not mistaken, Zlatan Ibrahimovic perpetrated a Marie Antoinette moment just after Paris Saint-Germain’s defeat of Rennes nine days ago.

During the 1-0 win, which prepared them perfectly for Sunday’s top-of-the-table visit to leaders Lyon, the Parc des Princes fans once again whistled and ‘rhubarb-rhubarbed’ their unhappiness with PSG’s lack of ‘élan’.

Asked about it, Zlatan declared that the peasants were revolting.

‘Maybe they ate caviar before we came,’ he sneered dismissively from on high, perhaps forgetting the word for cake.

‘We don’t know what they want. We play good, they whistle. We play bad, they whistle.’

And the concept that PSG’s has become a self-obsessed, out-of-touch court, revolving around the foolishness and self-indulgence of Zlatan the Sun King (or should that be ‘sinking’?) forced its way through on Tuesday night, too.

PSG won at Lille to reach the League Cup Final. But had Lille piped ‘Hi-ho, hi-ho it’s off to work we go’ from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs through speakers in their post-match mixed-zone, they would have scored a victory for the people. Certainly the fans and the media.

Led by Zlatan, players like Maxwell, Zoumana Camara, Marquinhos, Edinson Cavani and Lucas, all in red-hooded sweatshirts, cravenly trotted behind the self-appointed Roi Soleil as he barked the order: ‘Follow me, follow me... nobody talks!’

‘Why nobody talks?’ demanded a reporter. ‘Because I’m the boss’ tossed back Zlatan over his shoulder.

Just another brace of incidents in Zlatan’s descent into physical decrepitude and then irrelevance?

Or emblematic of PSG in isolation from the rest of French football?

In that sense, Sunday night at the Stade Gerland is the beginning not only of the entertaining three-way push for the title (including Marseille) but a hint at a wider referendum on French football.

PSG have not won hearts or minds. Not only in their own stadium, but more widely.

Obviously, given their wealth, the blue-collar mass of French football want to knit by the side of the demise of the aristocracy.

That’s only natural. But Laurent Blanc, and now Zlatan, are symbols of the first era of Parisian mega-wealth - and how it’s in decline.

Blanc will be super fortunate to survive past this summer given that neither his personality nor his football convince.

Ibrahimovic has played magnificently but won’t stay beyond the end of his contract and is quite evidently in physical decline.

Equally, many in French football used to feel similarly about Lyon.

Having never won the title before 2002, they repeated the feat seven times until 2008.

They even reached the Champions League semi-finals as recently as 2010 having often excelled in that competition - winning three and drawing four of their first seven competitive meetings with Real Madrid.

But Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas saw the lie of the land long before Qatar money bought PSG.

After a 5-2 thrashing by Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in March 2009, he announced to the French media that the country’s domestic football was pathetic - ‘third division’ in European terms. He savaged the pitches, the stadia, the development but, above all, the investment of intelligence, forward-planning, marketing and awareness of the football public.

So, six-years on, meet a man of his word. That rarest of breed: a visionary, open, ambitious, ‘judge my words by my actions’ kinda guy. Aulas has ripped up not only the squad but his club’s philosophy of buying foreign stars.

He set out on what has been a thorny and debilitating project to construct a new, larger stadium and has continued to both speak out, and act, on the need to modernise and re-construct almost all of French club football.

He has helped push through FFP, argues for an 18-team Ligue 1, the scrapping of the League Cup and harangues the short-sighted.

Creditably, during Lyon’s rebuilding since their last title win, the club has dropped out of the top three just twice in six seasons.

But if Hubert Fournier’s team can win on Sunday night, then push on to the title, many will view it as a huge and just reward for a strategy of cleverly calculated risk and putting money where the mouth is.

Aulas says: ‘Stadium construction has taken a little longer than expected. It should be ready by the end of this year. Suddenly we’ll have nearly 60,000 capacity, up by 20,000, so filling it is a worry. But it will be easier to fill a stadium custom-built for families and businesses.’

During a process which has nearly ruined big clubs in the past (Chelsea, Valencia), Aulas has cut the player salary bill by 40 per cent. Partly achieved by selling stars, partly by using home-bred youth, partly by recruiting cheaper players, it’s an equation which can lead to the ‘big stadium, poor team, low attendance’ nightmare.

Hence the importance of how Lyon are performing this season. To move onward and upwards, the team must make the new stadium magnetic. Now they have to stop selling.

‘We’ve invested €400million in this project,’ he said. ‘More than Monaco and PSG combined have spent on buying players recently!

‘But we project it should initially generate €40/50m, rising to €64/80m if we consolidate. Then eventually to €200m. That’s without selling players. Figures like this would put us back in the European top 10.’

And they would be welcome.

Atletico Madrid continued their recent derby dominance by hammering city rivals Real Madrid 4-0 on Saturday.

Tiago Mendes opened the scoring for the reigning champions at a raucous Vicente Calderon after 13 minutes and substitute Saul Niguez doubled the lead with an acrobatic goal just moments after replacing Koke.

Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic added to the goal glut in the second half to leave stunned Real thoroughly humiliated.

The win saw Atletico cut the gap to league-leaders Real to four points and ensured they remain undefeated in six Madrid derbies since losing the Champions League Final last May.
