Extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El Niños are expected to double, according to new research.

Climate scientists have warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts, wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years.

The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent and the event in 1997 cost between $35billion to $45billion in damage.

Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. Here, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes

Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific.

The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.

This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns.

The new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others.

Extreme El Niño events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years.

The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent.

An international team of scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, has spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events.

‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study.

‘El Nino events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming,’ he added.

The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.

Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two'

This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns, which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others.

Mike McPhaden of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the question of how global warming will change the frequency of extreme El Niño events has challenged scientists for more than 20 years.

‘This research is the first comprehensive examination of the issue to produce robust and convincing results,’ he said.

The impacts of extreme El Niño events extend to every continent across the globe killed an around 23,000 people in the 1997 event.

Wenju Cai, lead author of the study from CSIRO, said: ‘During an extreme El Niño event countries in the western Pacific, such as Australia and Indonesia, experienced devastating droughts and wild fires, while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of Ecuador and northern Peru.’

The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events. This satellite image shows the El Nino weather phenomena in 1997, represented by the the white area at the equator, which shows how the warm waters stretch from Peru to Alaska

In Australia, the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982-1983 extreme El Niño led to the Ash Wednesday Bushfire in southeast Australia, which resulted in 75 deaths.

The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events.

They found a ‘substantial’ increase in events from the present-day through the next 100 years as the eastern Pacific Ocean warms in response to global warming.

Professor Matthew England, a co-author from CoECSS, said: ‘This latest research based on rainfall patterns, suggests that extreme El Niño events are likely to double in frequency as the world warms leading to direct impacts on extreme weather events worldwide.’

‘For Australia, this could mean summer heat waves, like that recently experienced in the south-east of the country, could get an additional boost if they coincide with extreme El Niños,’ he added.

The impact of this year's El Niño events is expected to be felt by every continent. During the 1997 to 1998 events, damages were said to have been in the region of between $35billion to $45billion.
