Ally Swinton, pictured with his ripped clothes, survived a 2,000ft avalanche fall while walking along a ridge towards Mont Blanc

A British climber miraculously cheated death when he was taken by an avalance and hurled more than 2,000 feet down a steep mountain face and over a cliff.

Ally Swinton, 23, suffered just minor injuries following the incident, which happened as he walked along a ridge towards Mont Blanc, western Europe’s highest peak.

Yesterday, Ally, from Leven in Fife, described how he 'desperately swam and clawed' through the avalanche before being catapulted feet-first down the mountain.

A headshot of Ally, taken by himself three minutes after the avalanche to assess his injuries, shows his swollen and bloodied face.

Another, an aerial shot from the rescue helicopter, shows the avalanched mountain with Ally’s trail at the top dramatically stopping at the point at which he was thrown down.

Speaking from his home in the Chamonix Valley, in the French Alps, he said: 'All I could see was white. I was freefalling in this white room. My mouth was gagged with snow. I spat it out but it just filled up again. I shoved my fingers in my mouth to unplug it.

'I was on this roller-coaster.

'I felt gutted because I knew I was going to die. Completely gutted. I kept shouting: "No, no, no" with a few swear words added in.

'This was the way I was going to go. This was my lights out.'

Ally, who works as a transfer driver and is also sponsored by clothing brand Rab, was climbing with fellow Britons Ben Tibbetts, 30, a photographer from Hereford, and Londoner Misha Gopaul, 33.

They set off from Chamonix at 1am last Tuesday to climb Mont Blanc.

The three experienced mountaineers picked a technical route well within their capabilities that involved summitting the 13,294-ft Aiguille de Bionnassay.

Ally, who has climbed Mont Blanc five times, said: 'I got to the summit of the Bionnassay before the other two. It was about 12.30pm and there was no point in hanging around. I was tired and the winds had picked up. They were only just behind but out of sight around the ridge.

'I put my hood up and kept going. I could see Mont Blanc in the distance. I was just plodding along the ridge, locked in my own wee world, when silently and unexpectedly I fell on my left side. I couldn’t grasp what was happening.'

The whole mountain started cracking into a huge jigsaw of snow blocks. The avalanche was 500 feet wide.

He said: 'I tried so hard to claw at the snow. I was swimming for my life. I was doing a kind of front-crawl, desperately trying to swim my way to the top of the slope that was going with me.

'All I could see was white. I was 
freefalling in this white room. My mouth was gagged with snow. I spat it
out but it just filled up again'

'I was completely desperate. Your mind is telling you that is it, but you just physically keep trying. The top was only a metre away and I gained some ground but it was too late.

'I was desperately trying to get over the slab that was going with me. I tried and tried but I was well and truly engrossed in the avalanche.

'After these few seconds I knew I was going down.'

The south face of the Bionnassay has a rock ridge running horizontally across it. Ally believes his life may have been saved by the fact that he was catapulted over the steepest and smallest section of this cliff.

To the left and the right there are expansive rocks.

He said: 'By now I was in the avalanche feet-first, facing outwards. I was traveling at quite a speed.

'I remember going over the rock ridge because I was in free-fall. It was like being on a roller-coaster going down.

'It felt like I was a while in the air before hitting something.

'I was thinking: "This is really it. I am going off a cliff. I am going to die."'

The vertical drop off the ridge was about 200 feet. When he landed he was hurled with the avalanche debris a further 1,500 feet.

Suddenly he came to a halt. He was sat bolt upright on the avalanche debris which was about three feet deep.

Blood was dripping on the snow from his 
face. His camera was undamaged and he took a photograph of his face to 
assess his facial injuries.

He said: 'I had cut my nose and my mouth was a bit swollen. My left leg hurt but I knew it wasn’t broken. And that was about it, apart from a few other cuts.'

He managed to hobble across the slope, 
praying for a signal on his phone, when suddenly 20 minutes later he saw
a red dot near the summit of Bionnassay. It was Ben’s jacket. He could 
very faintly hear his friends shouting. He then heard a helicopter.

His friends had called rescuers some 10 minutes earlier to report their missing friend. They had been following Ally’s tracks leading to the summit of the Bionnassay when suddenly they stopped.

Ben said: 'I was walking in the tracks Ally had made and suddenly they stopped dead. I saw there had been an avalanche and did not believe it was survivable.

'I screamed at Misha to call mountain rescue. We told them there had been an avalanche and there was no sign of our friend. It’s really not describable how we felt.

'And then to see this unmistakable speck hobbling around down in the distance a good 25 minutes later was the most wonderful feeling. He was alive and mobile.

'When we were in the rescue helicopter I managed to take a picture of the ridge. It shows how Ali’s trail suddenly stops and the crown of the avalanche.'

The trio were airlifted off the mountain and Ally underwent a number of tests in hospital in Aosta, Italy. But he was pronounced fit enough to be discharged later that night.

He said: 'It was a very unlucky incident that happened to a very lucky boy. There had been no tell-tale signs. Nothing felt different. Nothing felt strange or unsafe.

'One day I will redo this route but there’s no intention to do it anytime soon.'
