Chock full of planets: The lighter band of the Milky Way's edge is seen in the night sky over Exmoor

Our galaxy contains at least 100billion planets - approximately one for every star - and many of them could harbour life, a new study claims.

Contrary to previous belief, the latest research by astronomers suggests star systems with planets are actually the norm across the cosmos.

And the analysis only includes planets in close orbits around certain kinds of stars, meaning the massive estimate they have offered could yet be doubled.

John Johnson, assistant professor of 
planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech),
called the estimate 'mind boggling'.

'There's at least 100 billion planets in the galaxy — just our galaxy,' he said.

Jonathan Swift, a postdoc student at 
Caltech and lead author of the paper due for publication in 
Astrophysical Journal, added: 'It's a staggering number, if you think 
about it. Basically there's one of these planets per star.'

Astronomers at Caltech made their 
estimate by analysing planets orbiting a sun called Kepler-32 which, 
they say, is representative of the vast majority of stars in our galaxy.

That system, which was detected by 
Nasa's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope, contains five planets, the
existence of two of which had already been confirmed by other 
astronomers.

The Caltech team confirmed the 
remaining three, then analysed the five-planet system and compared it to
other systems found by the Kepler mission.

The planets orbit an M dwarf star — also known as red dwarfs, this type accounts for about three-quarters of all stars in the Milky Way.

The five planets, which are similar in size to Earth and orbit close to their star, are also typical of the class of planets that the telescope has discovered orbiting other M dwarfs, Swift says.

Therefore, the researchers concluded, the majority of planets in the galaxy probably have characteristics comparable to those of the five planets.

Other teams of astronomers have 
already estimated that there is roughly one planet per star, but this is
the first time researchers have made such an estimate by studying 
M-dwarf systems.

But their 
analysis only considers planets that are in close orbits around M dwarfs
— not the outer planets of an M-dwarf system, or those orbiting other 
kinds of stars.

While Kepler 32 may not be unique, what sets it apart is its coincidental orientation: the orbits of the planets lie in a plane that's positioned such that the Kepler space telescope views the system edge-on.

Thanks to this rare orientation, each planet blocks Kepler-32's starlight as it passes between the star and the Kepler telescope.

By analysing changes in the star's brightness, the astronomers were able to determine the planets' characteristics, such as their sizes and orbital periods.

This orientation offered an opportunity to study the system in great detail, and because the planets represent the vast majority of planets that are thought to populate the galaxy, the system also can help astronomers better understand planet formation in general.

'I usually try not to call things "Rosetta stones", but this is as close to a Rosetta stone as anything I've seen,' said Professor Johnson.

'It's like unlocking a language that we're trying to understand—the language of planet formation.'

As a 
result, they say, their estimate is conservative. In fact, says Mr 
Swift, a more accurate estimate that includes data from other analyses 
could lead to an average of two planets per star.

M-dwarf systems like Kepler-32's are quite different from our own solar system. For one, M dwarfs are cooler and much smaller than the sun.

Kepler-32, for example, has half the mass of the sun and half its radius. The radii of its five planets range from 0.8 to 2.7 times that of Earth, and those planets orbit extremely close to their star.

The whole system fits within just over a tenth of an astronomical unit (the average distance between Earth and the sun) — a distance that is about a third of the radius of Mercury's orbit around the sun.

The fact that M-dwarf systems vastly outnumber other kinds of systems carries a profound implication, according to Professor Johnson, which is that our solar system is something of a cosmic 'weirdo'.

But although the planets in M-dwarf systems orbit close to their stars, it does not necessarily mean that they're fiery, hellish worlds unsuitable for life, the astronomers say.

Indeed, because M dwarfs are small and cool, their temperate zone — also known as the 'habitable zone,' the region where liquid water might exist — is also further inward.

Even though only the outermost of Kepler-32's five planets lies in its temperate zone, many other M dwarf systems have more planets that sit right in their temperate zones.

The implications of a galaxy chock full of planets are far-reaching, the researchers say.

'It's really fundamental from an origins standpoint,' said Mr Swift, who noted that because M dwarfs shine mainly in infrared light, the stars are invisible to the naked eye.

'Kepler has enabled us to look up at the sky and know that there are more planets out there than stars we can see.'
