A 20 minute delay in the rescue of a scuba diver who drowned off the Norfolk coast has caused a row between lifeboat services.

Chris Vanstone, 49, ran into difficulty 60 ft underwater while diving 17 miles out to sea on Friday.

When he surfaced unconscious, a distress call was made while Mr Vanstone was given CPR.

But the coastguard who took the distress call has been accused of ignoring a local lifeguard service in favour of a helicopter that took 40 minutes to reach the scene - a decision which cost 20 minutes.

Although the delay was not the difference between life and death for Mr Vanstone, who could not have been saved even by the closer boast, the overlooked Caister lifeboat service has hit out at the decision to use slower alternatives to answer a distress call.

Humber Coastguard, who co-ordinated the rescue, sent an RNLI boat from Gorleston, Norfolk, and a helicopter from Suffolk, instead of using the Caister lifeboat service, whose base in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was closest to the scene.

The helicopter was called at 1.20pm but did not arrive for almost 40 minutes.

Mr Vanstone, a plasterer from Brixton, South London was then airlifted to James Paget Hospital in Norfolk, and pronounced dead on arrival. An inquest later found that he had drowned.

But in the wake of his death the leader of the Caister service has claimed they could have been there in half the time.

Paul Garrod, the chairman of the Caister service, said that the RNLI base was six miles further along the coast, meaning their boat took substantially longer to arrive, according to The Sun.

‘We could have been there 15 to 20 minutes before any other craft – helicopter or boat. And when you’ve got someone who very sadly died on the boat, you need help straightaway. When a boat puts a mayday out they want someone there now.', he said.

‘We’ve got the fastest boat in the country, and a 250-mile radius.’

A spokesman for the RNLI said: ‘The RNLI is co-ordinated by the coastguard. We respond when we are paged and launch as soon as possible.

‘Overall responsibility for which assets go to each rescue is for them to decide.’

A spokesman for the coastguard defended their decision to send a helicopter to Mr Vanstone rather than the closer lifeboat.

She said: ‘In an incident off Great Yarmouth on Friday 30th August, Humber MRCC was contacted by a dive vessel reporting that one of their divers had surfaced and was in difficulty.

‘The incident occurred 17 miles offshore and the decision was made to send the RAF search and rescue helicopter from Wattisham as this was the quickest way to get the casualty to hospital.

‘The Gorleston RNLI all-weather lifeboat was also requested to launch to assist with the transportation of the dive buddy, particularly in view of the distance offshore.’
