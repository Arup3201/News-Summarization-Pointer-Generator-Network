More than 10 per cent of Brits has had items stolen from their hand luggage while waiting for a flight at an airport.

Turkey, Egypt, France, America and Greece emerged as the most common destinations outside the UK to become a victim of airport theft.

Mobile phones, money and passports were the possessions most likely to be taken, followed by jewellery and iPads or tablets.

Busy airport: Nearly half the victims (42 per cent) said they had been distracted at the time of the theft

Some 11 per cent of the 2,836 adults questioned confessed to having items stolen from them at an airport. With 88 per cent happening at an airport outside the UK.

Of the remaining individuals, 64 per cent said a friend or family member who had fallen prey to pickpockets.

Nearly half the victims (42 per cent) said they had been distracted at the time, while 36 per cent said they were asleep at the boarding gate or departure lounges.

For 12 per cent the theft happened whilst they were going to the toilet or buying goods in airport shops.

Six per cent of travellers said they were asleep at the boarding gate or departure lounges at time of theft

Fewer than half (47 per cent) reported the theft to airport staff, with just 18 per cent of these successfully managing to retrieve the stolen item or find out what happened to it. 

Those polled revealed the most likely items to be taken from hand luggage whilst at an airport were mobile phones (19 per cent), money (16 per cent), passports (11 per cent), jewellery (6 per cent), and iPads or tablets (4 per cent)

The countries in which the most airport thefts happened according to the survey are: Turkey (19 per cent), Egypt (17 per cent), France (12 per cent), America (9 per cent), and Greece (6 per cent).

Leon Edwards, Group Managing Director of Versapak, which carried out the survey, said: ‘When you are at an airport, there are certain circumstances that can have an adverse effect on how aware of personal belongings you are. 

‘I have also noticed at airports that a lot of the time, passengers take somewhat of a lacklustre approach towards their personal security. 

‘Much of the time, bags are kept on the airport floor and unfastened, meaning valuable goods are on show to everyone, including potential thieves.’
