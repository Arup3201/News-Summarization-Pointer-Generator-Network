CNN staff have been accused of making light of the deadly Ebola outbreak by posing for a photo while larking around with two men dressed in Hazmat suits.

Twitter users accused the three New Day anchors of mocking the Ebola crisis after CNN senior producer John Griffin posted the picture on social media.

In the photo, Chris Cuomo, Michaela Pereira and Alisyn Camerota pretend to be scared, with exaggerated shocked expressions, while two men in protective gear stand over them.

The photograph appeared on Griffin's Twitter account yesterday morning and it was deleted just over an hour later. But not before Inside Cable News picked up on it and shared the image online.

One Twitter user accused Griffin of acting in 'poor taste', before adding, 'pretty sad statement from a news "leader"'. 

Another commentator accused CNN of turning issues into 'CSI BS'.

According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed nearly 4,500 lives.

The vast majority of the fatalities have been in West Africa, but America has been on high alert since Ebola claimed its first victim on U.S. soil, when Thomas Duncan succumbed to the deadly disease on October 8.

Two nurses who were treating Mr Duncan also contracted the disease. But both Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are thought to be in stable condition after treatment for the deadly virus.

The distinctive full-body Hazmat (hazardous materials and items) suits with their protective masks have become a symbol of the epidemic, and have been seen on flights, at hospitals and anywhere an Ebola scare has erupted.

Although the virus has been contained in the United States, authorities have been making efforts to control the growing sense of panic among Americans.

In New York, firefighters have been banned from using the word 'Ebola' on their radios in because it could trigger panic in the city.

A New York Fire Department  memo instructs all personnel to use vaguer terms when referring to the deadly virus.

Instead, they should use the code letters 'F/T', as in Fever/Travel, over the radio to indicate a 911 caller has a fever and a history of travel to West Africa. 

'Just like you can’t say bomb on an airplane, we can’t say "Ebola", a source told the New York Post.

'Back in the ’80s and ’90s, taking universal precautions meant someone has AIDS. And we weren’t allowed to say AIDS either.'
