A British father-of-two stabbed to death in Barbados was a former Iraqi war veteran forced to quit the Army after a grenade blast damaged his hearing.

Brian Mulligan, 28, was on a six month contract to the Caribbean island working as a telecoms engineer when he became involved in an early morning dispute with a suspected drug dealer.

The former machine gunner was rushed to hospital at 5.30am on Sunday morning after being stabbed in the chest in the popular tourist area of St Lawrence Gap but he died from his injuries.

Army veteran and telecoms engineer Brian Mulligan had been in Barbados for eight weeks

Mulligan, originally from Forest Hill in South-East London, had served as a soldier for eight years and completed tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland before being medically discharged two years ago.

Colleagues revealed that he had 'served with distinction' and had been ranked tenth out of 360 men in a contest that involved an endurance march and shooting.

Mulligan's army career ended prematurely when he led a charge into an Iraqi house. An enemy grenade exploded close to him and permanently damaged his hearing.

After his discharge, he became a telecoms engineer, installing cables at Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 2.

Mr Mulligan flew to Barbados with other British engineers eight weeks ago to begin a project on the paradise isle, leaving his wife Jenna, 28, and children aged seven and four, behind in Ashtead, Surrey.

Barbados police said he was working with the Caribbean's leading telecommunications company LIME, which is owned by UK-based Cable & Wireless Communications.

The company's offices are in capital Bridgetown, which is about three miles from 'The Gap' where Mulligan was stabbed.

He said: 'He always was a happy go lucky guy. Even when work was hard, he would always be up for a laugh and would be smiling.

'He told me all about his time in the army and how he lost a large percentage of his hearing. It happened from an explosion in a house in Iraq.

'Insurgents released a grenade into building they stormed and he was first in.

'The explosion was in a side room and the walls were so thick it kept the explosion and noise inside, rupturing his eardrums.'

He added: 'He loved serving his country and was gutted to have to be medically discharged.'

In 2005, Mulligan spent six months dealing with riots and public disorder on one of the last British tours of Northern Ireland.

A friend who worked with him at Heathrow said: 'He was a loyal colleague who had served the Army heroically in challenging situations abroad.

'You always felt more confident when he was around because of his cheerful nature.'

Devastated friend and former Army colleague Anthony Sissons, 29, who was working with Mr Mulligan, wrote on his Facebook page: ‘Good night mate!! Keep a seat free for me in about 50 years time when I’ll see you again, sleep well, miss you, x’.

Mr Sissons’ mother Lesley said: ‘My son is distraught. They had gone out to watch the England - Italy football match. Anthony went back to where they were staying but Mr Mulligan and a few others went on to a nightclub when all this happened.’

Mr Mulligan’s wife Jemma, 28, who lives in Ashtead, Surrey, was too upset to comment.

One friend said: ‘Brian has served his country in numerous trouble spots and is a good family man. For this to happen when he is on a supposedly safe island is tragic news.’

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the death of a British National in Barbados on 15 June. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
