A new biography of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno sheds light on his fall from grace in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal.

The long-serving coach, affectionately called 'JoePa' by students, sobbed uncontrollably and continually after the university board fired him for allegedly overlooking the child abuse scandal involving his former assistant coach, according to an upcoming book by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

'Paterno met with his coaches at his house. He sobbed uncontrollably. This was his bad day,' Posanksi writes in his biography, Paterno.

Fall from grace: Joe Paterno (pictured with the Penn State football team in 2004) was overcome with emotion after he was fired from his coaching job in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal

The football legend repeatedly broke down after his ouster, leaving his coaching staff uncertain how to comfort the man who had always appeared tough as nails on the field.

'Nobody knew how to handle such emotion. Joe had always seemed invulnerable,' he writes.

Excerpts of the book, due out August 21, were printed in GQ.

Guilty: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on June 22, 2012 of sexually assaulting 10 boys over 15 years

Posanksi was granted access to Paterno in the summer of 2011 and was entrenched in the coach's inner circle in State College, Pennsylvania, when the grand jury indictment of Sandusky was delivered in November.

He describes how Paterno's son, 
Scott, a lawyer and lobbyist, saw the writing on the wall early on and 
was the first in the family to realize how damaging the scandal would be
on his father's reputation.

'When
Scott read the presentment, he called his father and said, 'Dad, you 
have to face the possibility that you will never coach another game.'

Posanski
also writes that despite Paterno's winning record on the field, he had 
made enemies on the Penn State board of trustees, according to Dan 
McGinn, the PR specialist who worked with the Paterno family when the 
scandal broke.

As 
early as 2004, Paterno had clashed with Penn State University President 
Graham Spanier and did not have allies who would support him, McGinn 
said, citing Paterno family adviser Guido D'Elia.

'The board started to turn [in 2004], we don't have anybody on the board now,' D'Elia told McGinn.

Fired: Joe Paterno (on November 9, 2011) the day he was fired from Penn State in the aftermath of the football team's child sex-abuse scandal

After
Sandusky was arrested on November 5, 2011 and charged with multiple 
counts of sexual abuse, Paterno said on November 9 that he would resign 
at the end of the season from his coaching post at Penn State after 46 
years.

But the Penn State board rejected his resignation and instead voted to fire Paterno, delivering the news in a late night telephone.

'My name. I have spent my whole life trying to make that name mean something. And now it's gone,' he told his son Jay, who had served on the coaching staff of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team under his father.

Goodbye to JoePa: Penn State students remember former head football coach Joe Paterno after his death on January 22, 2012

On November 18, the family revealed that Paterno was suffering from a treatable form of lung cancer.

On January 22, 2012, Paterno died at the age of 85.

An independent report of the scandal, conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, concluded that Paterno, president Graham Spanier, athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz 'failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.'

The report, released in July, called the school officials 'callousâ€™ for their disregard of the child victims.

After a highly publicized trial in June 2012, Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 criminal counts for sexually abusing 10 victims.

He will be sentenced in September.
