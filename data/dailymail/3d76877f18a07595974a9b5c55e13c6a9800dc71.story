France was yesterday rocked by the news that its troubled economy slammed into reverse over the summer.

Official figures showed output fell by 0.1 per cent between July and September - leaving the country on the brink of another recession.

The dismal news came just a week after Standard & Poor’s cut France’s credit rating by a further notch to AA in a humiliating setback for President Francois Hollande.

The performance in the rest of the eurozone was little better with output in the single currency bloc growing by just 0.1pc in the third quarter down from 0.3pc in the previous three months.

The German economy slowed from 0.7 per cent to just 0.3 per cent.

Figures from Italy showed its economy shrank by 0.1pc following a 0.3pc contraction in the second quarter.

But Spain notched up growth of 0.1 per cent  - its first quarter of expansion since early 2011.

The disappointing figures from the across the region were a stark reminder that the eurozone crisis is far from over and fuelled fears of a long and painful recovery.

It was also in stark contrast to the UK where the economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of the year.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney this week said the ‘glass is half full’ in Britain and hailed ‘one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world’.

It came as figures showed unemployment in the UK has fallen to 7.6 per cent and a record of nearly 30m people are in work.

Unemployment in the eurozone is at a record high of over 12 per cent and more than half of Spanish and Greek youngsters who want a job cannot find work.

Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The near-stagnation of the eurozone economy in the third quarter underlines the fragility of the recovery and the growing dangers of a damaging bout of deflation in the region.’

The European Central Bank last week cut interest rates from 0.5 per cent to a new record low of 0.25 per cent in a desperate bid to stave of deflation and inject life into the economy.

But with Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, slowing and France, the second biggest, in decline, experts fear the move was too little too late.

Analysts said the renewed slump in France, following growth of 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, is particularly alarming and piles pressure on Hollande and his Socialist government.

It also made a mockery of Hollande’s claim in August that ‘the recovery is here’.

In a devastating analysis last week, S&P highlighted the risks to the French economy posed by weak economic growth, high unemployment, the rising national debt and ‘elevated’ levels of tax and spending.

The latest downgrade – which could push up French borrowing costs as investors worry about the country’s credit-worthiness – came less than two years after France was stripped of its top-notch AAA rating and sparked fears of fresh turmoil across the eurozone.

French unemployment is at a record high of 11.1 per cent or 3.3m in September and more than a quarter of under-25s who want a job cannot find work.
