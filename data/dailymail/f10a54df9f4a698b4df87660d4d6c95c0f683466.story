Schoolgirl Mia Lindsay, 15, with her mother Zora

Tony Blair’s former boarding school has been accused of ignoring the plight of a pupil whose parents can no longer afford the fees.

Mia Lindsay, 15, a day pupil at Fettes College for five years, is unable to return to complete her vital GCSE year.

Sean and Zora Lindsay say that after splashing out more than £100,000, they believed the Edinburgh school would support them when they fell on hard times.

Mrs Lindsay, 46, was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago. She was forced to leave her job as the operations manager of a casino, leaving the family unable to meet the £23,190-a-year fees.

The school waived the fees for six months while Mrs Lindsay underwent treatment. 

However, this financial assistance ended at Easter and Mia was told she must leave.

She remained for the summer term and the family must now pay back £10,000. 

In January 2013, Fettes was warned by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator that the school’s charitable status could be stripped unless it greatly increased access for poorer students.

Mr Lindsay, 49, a former pupil, said: ‘We are stunned at the cruel way we’ve been treated. Mia has been at Fettes for five years and she loves it.

‘We cannot believe this extraordinary decision at the start of such a crucial year just as she is about to sit the most important exams of her life.

‘We have already paid out over £100,000 in fees over the past years and it’s through no fault of our own we find ourselves in this position.

‘All we were asking is for Fettes to show some compassion during this time of hardship and allow Mia to finish her GCSEs with them.’

The family’s difficulties began last September when Mrs Lindsay was diagnosed with breast cancer.

She says: ‘As a contractor I didn’t qualify for company sick pay and with no income coming in, the school agreed to waive the fees for six months.’ 

However, after six months doctors said Mrs Lindsay was still too ill to return to work.

The teenager has attended Fettes College in Edinburgh, where former Prime Minister Tony Blair went to school, for the last five years but has now been forced to move to a  state school after her parents could no longer pay

Peter Worlledge, bursar at Fettes College (pictured), said: ‘We have every sympathy with the Lindsay family but with finite funds available, Fettes College is simply unable to support every request for financial support'

She said: ‘To see her (Mia) forced to leave in her final year has added huge stress. With the worry of my cancer, it’s been deeply distressing.’

Mr Lindsay, a house husband, says in an effort to overturn the school’s decision, they managed to secure £500 a term from a local charity which helps with student grants.

However the school has said the family must pay the full fees of £7,730-a-term and clear the arrears.

Mr Lindsay said: ‘I am astounded Fettes can claim charitable status when this is how they treat loyal parents.

‘I also can’t believe the school doesn’t have a fund to help parents like us who through no fault of their own, find themselves unable to pay the fees.’

Mia has now started at a local state school, but her parents still hope she can finish her studies at Fettes.

Peter Worlledge, bursar at Fettes College said: ‘We have every sympathy with the Lindsay family but with finite funds available, Fettes College is simply unable to support every request for financial support.’

Fettes College was founded in 1870 after Sir William Fettes bequeathed £166,000 for the education of poor children and orphans. 

As well as Mr Blair, who attended in the 1970s, other alumni include David Ogilvy, one of the biggest names in advertising, and General John de Chastelain, who oversaw IRA arms decommissioning.
