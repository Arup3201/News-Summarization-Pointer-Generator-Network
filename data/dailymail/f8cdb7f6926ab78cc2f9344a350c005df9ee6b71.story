Arrest: The British lawyer is said to have hired the agency for a disgraced Nigerian governor, James Ibori (pictured)

A top lawyer has been arrested after allegedly hiring a British private investigations firm who bribed policemen on behalf of a disgraced Nigerian politician.

Ian Timlin was arrested by officers at his home in Kent in April on suspicion of conspiracy to corrupt a police officer, perverting the course of justice and money-laundering offences.

The former litigation partner at Speechly Bircham, a law firm specialising in tax affairs and corporate transactions, is said to have hired the agency for a disgraced Nigerian governor, James Ibori.

The politician, who was jailed for 
embezzlement last year after stealing around £50million, hired Speechly 
Bircham while the Metropolitan Police were investigating his affairs.

Documents
seen by The Independent newspaper suggest that Mr Timlin hired RISC 
Management, an investigations firm run by former police officers, who 
allegedly paid serving detectives a fee of £20,000 for information that 
was given to Ibori’s defence lawyers.

According
to the documents, a payment of £5,000 was also allegedly made to a 
source for information relating to ‘forthcoming interviewing strategy to
be deployed by police’.

A spokesperson for Speechly Bircham 
said: ‘Given an arrest was made some months ago and there has since been
no charge, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.

'Suffice to say that we have assisted the police with their enquiries.’
