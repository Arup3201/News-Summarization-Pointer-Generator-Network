Jill Kelley and her doctor husband have filed a new lawsuit where they accuse high-ranking U.S. officials of leaking their personal information to the media as part of a 'malicious smear campaign'.

Last year, Florida socialite Mrs Kelley's report of cyber-stalking to the FBI inadvertently revealed an illicit affair between CIA director David Petraeus and author Paula Broadwell, ending the distinguished military official's career. 

In their original lawsuit in June, Mrs Kelley and her husband Scott claimed that in the wake of the sex scandal, the FBI and Department of Defense violated the federal privacy act by leaking their personal information to the press.

The couple are seeking an apology as well as financial compensation.

An amended lawsuit has been filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., an NBC
investigation revealed on Friday, and is designed to pile on pressure by naming top-ranking officials who may be subpoenaed if the case continues.

The suit claims that the Kellys’ names, 
emails and personal information were improperly leaked to the media 
following Petraeus' resignation on November 9, 2012.

Among those named are Deputy FBI Director Sean Joyce, former bureau director Robert Mueller, Attorney General Eric Holder and other top officials who Kelley claims made decisions on the investigation into the Petraeus scandal 'based on the timing of the 2012 presidential election', NBC reported.

Jill Kelley was under intense media scrutiny at the time of Petraeus' resignation due to her reputation for throwing parties for military and intelligence big wigs at her Tampa home near MacDill Air Force Base - headquarters of U.S. Central Command.

The leaks placed the socialite in 
the middle of an avalanche of unfavorable publicity and as a result, she
shouldered the blame as the villain in the downfall of Petraeus and 
General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the lawsuit 
states.

The lawsuit reads: '[T]he government was not legally entitled to treat the Kelleys’ like criminals, pry into and disclose their personal communications, violate their privacy, and disseminate confidentialrecords as well as false information about them.' 

Allegations: The suit says the FBI did not provide Kelley the security protection a victim is entitled to because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election

In September, the Obama 
administration sought to dismiss the lawsuit. The Justice Department 
declined to comment to NBC on Friday about the amended lawsuit. 

The suit claims the leaks violated 
the Privacy Act, which was enacted in 1974 after revelations of illegal 
surveillance by federal agencies in the Watergate scandal.

The Justice Department said in a 
court filing that Kelley has failed to present any facts suggesting that
the FBI and the Pentagon flagrantly disregarded her privacy rights.

In an act that triggered the criminal
probe resulting in Petraeus' forced resignation, Kelley told the FBI 
in May 2012 that she and several U.S. top military officers had been the recipients of 
anonymous harassing emails.

Kelley and her husband 'sought to do the right thing by reporting the facts' to the FBI, the lawsuit says.

But 'rather than protect the Kelleys'
privacy interests as the law and their duty required, defendants 
instead willfully and maliciously thrust the Kelleys into the maw of 
public scrutiny concerning one of the most widely reported sex scandals 
to rock the United States government'.

Some of the anonymous emails ultimately traced to Paula Broadwell were sent to Allen.

The messages included notes on the general's plans to see Kelley in Washington the following week.

Allen was concerned about how anyone else would know about his personal plans.

One email mentioned Petraeus and an 
upcoming social event and military and intelligence meeting with NATO 
leaders in Washington.

The emails to the generals claimed Kelley was up to no good and impugned her motives for befriending the military leaders.

The lawsuit says the U.S. government 
'unforgivably transformed Mrs Kelley's reputation from that of a 
respected business and community leader'.

According to the lawsuit, the FBI 
Washington cyber division and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce directed 
agents in the Tampa Field office to treat the Kelleys' case differently 
than normal criminal investigations.

For example, the suit says, the FBI 
did not provide Kelley with security protection to which a victim is 
entitled because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the 
upcoming presidential election.

The lawsuit also says the FBI in 
Washington directed investigating agents not to proceed with a scheduled
effort to interview Broadwell once the agents had determined she was 
the stalker.

Government officials violated the 
Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches in its review of Kelley's 
emails, the suit claims.

It alleges they have suffered 
financial losses because of the government's actions. They are seeking 
monetary damages and an apology, among other things.

In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea.

She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.
