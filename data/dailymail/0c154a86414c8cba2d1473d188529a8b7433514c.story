Teenage staff at a Melbourne restaurant weren't making any dough but instead were being paid in pizza by their employer.

Restauranteur Ruby Chand was fined $334,818 for underpaying 111 workers at two of his La Porchetta restaurants. Instead Chand offered them discounted pizza and soft drink.

The workers were underpaid a total of $258,000.

Many of his workers were teenagers with one as young as 13 years old and were employed on a part-time of casual basis between 2009 and 2012.

Chand was ordered by Judge John O'Sullivan to hand over the fines in a Federal Circuit Court ruling on June 6, the Fair Work Ombudsman said on Tuesday.

Judge O'Sullivan said the practice of offering workers discounted food and drink instead of pay belonged 'in the dark ages'.

'Ensuring compliance with minimum standards is an important consideration in this case,' he said.

Chand was ordered to pay a personal fine of $55,803, while his companies operating the restaurants - Bound for Glory Enterprises Pty Ltd and Zillion Zenith International Pty Ltd - were each fined $139,507.50 a piece.

The two companies were also required to back-pay workers who had money owed to them, with more than $79,000 still outstanding.

Judge O'Sullivan said the crackdown was to serve as a deterrent for Chand and his companies from possible future breaches.

Ruby Chand, from Tecoma in Melbourne, was fined a total of $334,000 for underpaying staff - some as young as 13

The two restaurants were operated by Bound for Glory Enterprises Pty Ltd and Zillion Zenith International Pty Ltd who were fined $139,507.50 each

'The contraventions themselves and the conduct of the respondents fundamentally hamstrung the ability to confirm the affected employeesâ€™ entitlements during the investigation, the co-operation was less than forthcoming,' he said.

'In that sense I am not convinced the respondents are genuinely remorseful.'

Chand has previously been required to back-pay other employees who were underpaid in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and was warned by Fair Work inspectors that he needed to pay employees what they were due.

The La Porchetta franchises were investigated after receiving a complaint from a parent of a young staff member.

It was discovered almost 60 employees at the Pakenham branch had been underpaid by $130,195 and more than 50 employees at Berwick had been short-changed $127,824.

The court heard Chand was giving half-priced pizzas and soft drinks to employees to 'offset' the cost of their wages.

Underpayments to individual employees ranged from as little as $3 up to $25,358

Employees were also being paid below the minimum wage they were entitled to, and apprentices and trainees were also found to be in a similar situation.

Underpayments to individual employees ranged from as little as $3 up to $25,358.

Part-time and casual employees were taken on as cooks, kitchen attendants, food and beverage service employees as well as part of training programs, allowing Chand's companies access to more than $45,000 worth of Commonwealth benefits.
