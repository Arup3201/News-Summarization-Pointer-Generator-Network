Hillary Clinton does not draw a salary for her work at the Clinton Foundation, 'a source close to Clinton' divulged yesterday, nor does the organization pay the salaries of Hillary's entourage.

The disclosure comes as a Republican 
opposition research outfit pressures the Clinton Foundation to provide 
assurances that it is not directly or indirectly helping to lay the 
groundwork for Hillary's presumed 2016 presidential run.

Hillary's staff consists of approximately seven aides, including Huma Abedin – disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner's wife – who are reportedly responsible for managing her paid speaking
 gigs and helping her promote her memoir Hard Choices, which 
came out last month.

'Cui bono?': It's unclear whether Hillary's nascent presidential campaign benefits from the speaking feed donated to her family foundation when she and daughter Chelsea make public appearances

Huma Abedin, a longtime Hillary aide who worked with her at the State Department and is now her closest confidante at the Clinton Foundation, is a likely campaign spokeswoman if and when Clinton runs for president

Though they
 work out of Hillary's office at the Clinton Foundation, they are not 
employed by the nonprofit, an anonymous source reportedly told Business Insider.

'The Secretary's personal staff is paid for by her personally,' the source said.

It's common practice for campaign aides to be rewarded with government positions after a job well done. And it's no surprise the Clintons would hire trusted aides to manage their nonprofit organization.

But Republican political groups like America Rising PAC and the Republican National Committee are questioning the whether foundation staff are gearing up to join Hillary's 2016 presidential campaign.

The Clinton Foundation website lists the names and biographies of 19 staffers on the foundation's leadership team, of whom half acknowledge their political backgrounds.

In their bios, five members of the leadership team mention working on Hillary's failed presidential campaign, three others say they've worked for Hillary or Bill in some other capacity when the Clintons served as elected officials and another employee acknowledges working for Obama.

America Rising wants the Clinton Foundation to make public a full list of staff or paid consultants who worked for the Clinton in the past or have worked for Obama or the Democratic Party and for both Hillary and Bill to come clean about which speaking fees they've donated to the Clinton Foundation in 2013 and 2014.

Hillary recently said she donates all the money given to her by universities for appearances but has provided no proof to substantiate her claim.

America Rising also requested a list of travel expenses for Bill, Hillary and Chelsea and a document outlining the costs for the Clinton Global Initiative.

A 2013 review of the Clinton Foundation's 
ax documents completed by the New York Post found that the organization 
spent $50 million throughout the previous decade on travel, and America Rising is curious to know how much of that went toward personal travel for the Clinton family.

In an email to reporters on Monday,
 America Rising PAC Executive Director Tim Miller said Hillary's 
assertion that she passes on checks from universities to the foundation 
opened 'the door to questions about just how that foundation is spending
 money.'

Clinton will need as much staff support as she can get if she runs for president, in part to deflect and diffuse controversies -- like the 2012 Benghazi terror attack -- that continue to dog her

'In the 
past, the Clinton Foundation has spent millions on opulent travel and 
lodging for her family, financed glitzy, celebrity-fueled donor events 
and paid key Democratic aides who would likely play key roles in her 
presidential campaign,' he said.

'For Americans to credibly believe these speaking 
fees are being donated to charitable endeavors, the foundation must be 
transparent about how and where it has spent its millions since Hillary 
Clinton joined last year.'

America Rising's concerns that the Clinton Foundation may be serving as the unofficial home for Hillary's unannounced presidential campaign stem from a 2011 internal review of the foundation that cited concerns about perceived and real conflicts of interest within the organization's hierarchy.

The Republican PAC also points to the review and a 2013 article from the New York Times that suggested that foundation could 'serve as a base for [Hillary] to home in on issues and to build up a stable 
of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political 
campaign' as evidence that its charges are not unfounded.

The same New York Times article notes that Hillary brought a staff of approximately seven people with her to the foundation when she left the State Department last year, including Abedin, who has been spotted with Hillary frequently throughout her Hard Choices book tour.

A spokesman for Chelsea Clinton confirmed to the New York Times on Wednesday that the former first daughter is not paid by the Clinton Foundation either, despite holding the role of Vice Chair and contributing a significant amount of time to helping manage her family's charity.

Bill Clinton is yet to disclose personally or through a representative whether he receives a paycheck from the organization on top of the millions he earns annually in speaking fees.
