Tragic: Samantha Kwek, 22, jumped to her death from the 16th-floor of an apartment building near the UN building in New York

A 22-year-old woman who jumped to her death from the 16th floor of a luxury apartment building just one block from the United Nations headquarters in New York was today named as Samantha Kwek.

The Columbia University student fell from a balcony following a fight with her boyfriend, who lives in the building, late on Sunday night. She reportedly left a suicide note.

She landed on East 48th Street in front of 100 United Nations Plaza, a 52-storey building across the street from the Algerian Embassy.

A pocketbook was lying a few feet from her body, which was draped with a white sheet as police investigated.

Miss Kwek had threatened to kill herself in several text messages she had exchanged with her boyfriend Benjamin Small, 30, the New York Post reported.

A devastated Mr Smart today told the newspaper: 'I really don’t know why [she jumped]. She was really, really sad, I guess... I’m mortified.'

Miss Kwek wanted to end their relationship and the couple were thought to have been arguing about breaking up, family members said last night.

Her brother-in-law Vincent Campanella, who is married to Miss Kwek's sister, said the couple were due to join them for a meal to celebrate Chinese New Year on Sunday night but didn't come.

He said: 'This is really a shock for all of us. It's very hard for all of us to believe.

'She's not one to be attached to a guy like that. She's strong and smart and involved.

'To jump out 16 floors takes a lot, to take your life. It all seems a little too fishy.'

Plunge: Police say the woman fell from a 16th-storey balcony at 100 United Nations Plaza

Dino Sajudin, 40, a doorman working 
on the opposite side of the street, told the New York Daily News that 
his friends saw the woman's body on the ground and ran into the building
screaming: 'She just jumped! She just jumped!'

He said: 'We crossed the street together and we saw her lying there.'

Investigators are examining the 16th-floor balcony of the building, which houses several diplomats.

Deb Alter was returning from a 
shopping trip with her teenage daughter and ten-year-old son when they 
came upon the grisly scene.

'We flipped out,' she said. 'My little boy was really shaken up.'

Miss Kwek had long, black hair and was wearing grey Ugg boots, she said.

Another witness said the woman was fully dressed with her coat on.

One man, who declined to give his name, was interviewed by police officers about what he saw.

'I just heard a scream,' the man said, declining to elaborate.

The gruesome death occurred in New 
York's diplomatic corridor, where the UN headquarters and numerous 
offices and agencies are located.

Several nations also house their 
embassies and ambassadors in the upscale neighbourhood where diplomatic 
license plates on dark SUVs are a common sight.
