A millionaire City lawyer jailed after hatching an elaborate kidnap story to escape a drink-drive charge has been freed just one month into his prison term as an 'act of mercy'.

Francis Bridgeman, 43, drunkenly crashed his £50,000 Range Rover into a telegraph pole but tried to escape punishment by telling detectives he had been the victim of a kidnapping.

However, after 200 hours of wasted police time and a court case in which he was jailed for a year for perverting the course of justice, Bridgeman was freed after one month as an act of mercy to his seriously ill wife.

The top lawyer had been originally convicted after Lewes Crown Court heard he crashed his car following a five-pint drinking session with a friend last April.

His claim to police that he had been kidnapped unravelled 
when CCTV footage showed him weaving drunkenly along a train platform at
London Bridge Station after a post-work pub binge, where he drank five 
pints of Guinness with a friend.

Today, after hearing of Bridgeman’s wife’s very serious illness, three senior judges quashed the sentence to allow him to go back home and care for her.

Mr Justice Lloyd Jones, sitting with Lord Justice Toulson and Sir Christopher Holland, told the Court of Appeal that, but for his wife’s situation, the sentence would have been appropriate.

Bridgeman was missing for some time after his car was found locked, with its air bag activated, on a verge in Shovers Green, Ticehurst, East Sussex, the judge said.

When he returned home, he was questioned by police and gave an elaborate account of being kidnapped, hooded and then dumped in a field by his assailant.

However, investigations revealed that he had been out drinking in London after work and was seen unsteady on his feet at London Bridge Station.

Tests showed he would have been over the limit when the smash occurred.

Investigation of the air bag in his car, which would have been sealed, also revealed the presence of his DNA, suggesting he was behind the wheel when it crashed.

Bridgeman continued to deny the lies in court, but by the time he was sentenced had accepted that he was guilty, the appeal judge continued.

His legal team today argued that mercy should be afforded to allow the disgraced lawyer, who is now unemployed, to go back to his wife.

Judge Guy Anthony had originally jailed Bridgeman for 12 months and told Lewes Crown 
Court (pictured) the sentence would have been less if he hadn't spun his
web of lies

She is emotionally and physically dependant on her husband and her condition would make prison visits almost impossible, the court was told.

'Throughout her illness, the appellant has been his wife’s principle carer.

He had taken extensive periods off work to care for her,' the appeal judge said.

'Having regard to all of the matters, we have come to the conclusion that, as an act of mercy in exceptional circumstances, this court should intervene.

'In doing so, we make it clear that we expressly disregard this appellant’s fall from grace.

'The court is able to take the course it takes today simply because of the extreme condition of the appellant’s wife.'

The 12-month sentence was suspended for two years.
