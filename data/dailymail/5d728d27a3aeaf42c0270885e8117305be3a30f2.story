A viral video showing a woman practically inhaling a piece of turkey is causing worry due to the risk of young people attempting to copy the stunt.

The 14-second YouTube clip sees a woman hold up a thin slice of cold turkey meat, and swallowing it in the blink of an eye.

The woman, named Lacey Dallis Robertson from Utah, then smiles for the camera and opens her mouth to show that the meat is gone.

Swift move: Lacey Dallis Robertson from Utah takes part in the #10secondtalentshow with her 'turkey slurpee'

Useful talent: Ms Roberston practically inhales the slice of cold turkey, and it's gone in less than a second

Schlurp: The turkey disappears so fast the camera, right, cannot keep up with Ms Robertson

The original video has been viewed nearly 630,000 times since it was uploaded two weeks ago.

The man in the background, Shaun McBride, a Snapchat-celebrity who goes under the moniker Shonduras, also attempts the Turkey Slurpee, but chokes on the meat.

Mr McBride, 27, also from Utah, is one of few Snapchat celebs who makes thousands of dollars in advertising deals with companies trying to get the 13-25 market.

The video is part of Shonduras' #10secondtalentshow, a project which has thousands of followers around the globe.

Tadaa! Ms Robertson proudly shows that she had swallowed the meat

Proof: As Ms Robertson shows her empty mouth, Mr McBride is attempting the Turkey Slurpee himself

Bad move: Mr McBride, better known under his Snapchat name Shonduras, chokes on the turkey

The Turkey Slurpee video has already resulted in several copy-cat clips, where young teenagers as well as adults try to copy Ms Robertson, and unsurprisingly, choke.

'This is outright dangerous, people could easily aspirate and choke on the meat as a result of trying to swallow as you inhale,' Dr. Robert Glatter, an ER physician at a New York hospital told FoxNews.com

'By comparison, the cinnamon challenge is almost benign.'

'People should never try this home, and kids especially should not do this.'
