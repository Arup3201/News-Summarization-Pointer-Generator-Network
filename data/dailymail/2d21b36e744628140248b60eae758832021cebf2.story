Labour MPs cheered jokes about killing the Royal Family and lynching Tory Cabinet minister Esther McVey at a tasteless Remembrance Sunday event

The Labour party today tried to disown comments made by a senior backbencher about wanting to 'lynch' a Tory Cabinet minister.

Left-winger John McDonnell made the offensive remarks about Employment Minister Esther McVey at a tasteless Remembrance Sunday event, the Daily Mail revealed today.

He told the audience how a campaign had been launched to kick Ms McVey out of her seat, but activists were arguing 'Why we are sacking her? Why aren't we lynching the b******?'.

The Tories condemned the public call for a 'violent attack' on a female MP.

But the Labour party only tweeted a message in response, stating: 'John McDonnell's comments, if accurately reported, don't represent the views of the Labour Party. He speaks for himself.'

Mr McDonnell said he regarded the 'Daily Mail having a go at me' as a 'badge of honour'.

He added: 'All I'm saying is don't blame me for simply repeating what some of Esther McVey's constituents have said at a public meeting.' 

The 'anti-war comedy night' even featured remarks mocking the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London and killing the Royal Family.

Among those attending the event at a club in Covent Garden were former shadow minister Diane Abbott and Left-wing MP Jeremy Corbyn. 

Last night, Ed Miliband faced calls to condemn the MPs for taking part in the 'sickening' event, held as the sacrifices made by our Armed Forces since the start of the First World War 100 years ago were honoured across the country.

But Mr Corbyn risked causing further offence by insisting the comedy night – organised as a tribute to Labour firebrand and anti-war campaigner Tony Benn, who died in March aged 88 – was 'a great event' that he 'really enjoyed'.

In his speech, Mr McDonnell, the MP for Hayes and Harlington, spoke about a visit to Miss McVey's Wirral West constituency, where the former TV presenter faces a major union-backed campaign to oust her from the marginal seat. 

To applause, he said: 'I was up in Liverpool a fortnight ago where Alec McFadden, one of our [union] organisers, launched the Sack Esther McVey Day on her birthday.

'I spoke at a packed public meeting... there was a whole group in the audience that completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept, because they were arguing 'Why we are sacking her? 

'Why aren't we lynching the b******?'

Comedian Steve Gribbin was then loudly cheered and applauded when he said: 'I'm not a fan of the Royal Family, they are a bunch of parasites.'

He added: 'There are royalists in [the audience], I can feel the anger. 'Leave them alone'. No, kill 'em.'

London Labour MP Diane Abbott was also at the event but has refused to comment on the story

Left-wing activist and blogger Mark McGowan, who uses the stage name The Artist Taxi Driver, mocked the Tower of London ceramic poppies as 'a river of blood'. 

Last night Tory MPs demanded that Mr McDonnell have the Labour whip withdrawn until he apologises and withdraws his comments about Miss McVey.

Defence Minister Anna Soubry said: 'These comments, made on Remembrance Sunday of all days, are extremely serious. 

There can be no excuse for a Member of Parliament to fantasise about someone's death. 

'Ed Miliband must remove the whip from John McDonnell. 

The Labour Party must not be a refuge to those who incite violence.'

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: 'It's sickening that Labour MPs chose to mark Remembrance Sunday, a hundred years since the outbreak of World War One, by making vile death threats against a female MP.

'Ed Miliband has totally lost control. His own frontbench MPs are inciting hatred and violence against women.  

John McDonnell should be forced to withdraw his disgusting comments, and apologise.'

The Labour Party, Mr McDonnell and Miss Abbott did not respond to requests to comment last night.

Mr Corbyn, MP for Islington North, said: 'It was a great event and I really enjoyed it.

'Tony Benn dedicated his whole life to ending, not glorifying, war.'

MP John McDonnell

'I was up in Liverpool a fortnight ago where Alec McFadden, one of our organisers, launched the Sack Esther McVey Day on her birthday. I spoke at a packed public meeting, it was absolutely packed but there was a whole group in the audience that completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept because they were arguing, 'Why are sacking her, why aren't we lynching the bastard?'

'Tony [Benn] always said how you can use a ballot box to change the world. But there's [another] way too, which in the old days we called insurrection, now we call it direct action. It's when the Government don't do as you want, you get in the streets or you occupy and you take direct action against them.'

'Electorally, let's just learn the lessons from Tony Benn, electorally let's be absolutely clear, in this election in May coming up we've got to get these b******s out. We've got to destroy this Government. We cannot cope with the re-election of a Tory Government in whatever coalition form it is, because our society cannot cope with it. That's why for those people who are talking about not voting or not mobilising, to be frank that's a combination of dereliction of duty and cowardice.'

Activist Mark McGowan

'We need a new politics. We need radical change, we're moving towards a next general election where no one's got any ******* hope at all. Any decent person would want to vote Labour, any decent person would, but they're in ******* bits. Ed Miliband said they're going to [put] 25p on the minimum wage... we've got every single politician standing up and talking about affordable housing. It's the biggest bunch of s*** ever.'

'Today is 100 years [since the start of the First World War], this is what they're celebrating with a river of blood coming out of the Tower of London from the royals, from the monarch, and they're all there today. And Tony Blair's there today, Tony Blair, that's the Labour Party's gift to the world.'

Comedian Steve Gribbin

'I'm not a fan of the Royal Family, they are a bunch of parasites. Lovely Katie is having a new baby, she's opted for a home birth, she's got so many to choose from… There are royalists in [the audience], I can feel the anger. 'Leave them alone'. No, kill 'em.'
