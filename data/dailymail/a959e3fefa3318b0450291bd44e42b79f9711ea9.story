A sex offender and his girlfriend were arrested on Wednesday after a cell phone laden with child porn images was left in a Walmart shopping cart.

The phone allegedly belonged to Alan Robert Johnson, 33, convicted in 2003 of possessing and transporting child pornography, and his partner Jennifer Sparks, 37. The phone was found by a customer on June 2.

It contained pictures of a naked boys and girls, said police, who are investigating a possible child porn operation that they believe may involve the parents of one of the girls, aged four.

Registered in Sparks' name, the phone was left in a cart at the Walmart Neighbourhood Market on Pine Island Road in Cape Coral, Florida.

Officers tracked down Johnson when they found an email address on the phone which led to him.

They also found his Facebook page which displayed several of the same photos found on the cell.

At the couple’s North Fort Myers home, officers also found pictures and videos of the pair molesting and having oral sex with a four-year-old girl, news-press.com reported. 

'They sexually abused her in every way imaginable,' Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott told winknews.com.

'In fact my most seasoned detectives here said that it's the worst they've ever seen.'

Scott described the pair as 'animals' and said he hoped the girl involved will be able to rebuild her life and move forward.

The girl has since been placed in the custody of the Department of Children and Families.

A further investigation is underway 
into her parents, from Tampa, as police believe they may have 
intentionally left their daughter with the accused molesters and possibly even paid 
them. 

The Sheriff’s Office
said she stayed with the couple around six weeks before being 
transported to someone in Lakeland, where they suspect similar acts were
carried out.

Johnson and Sparks remain in Lee County Jail where they are being held without bail. 

Both face charges of sexual assault against a victim under 12, directing or promoting sexual performance by a child and possession of child pornography.
