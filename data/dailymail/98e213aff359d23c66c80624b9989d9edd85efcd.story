FIFA have clarified their position regarding ‘cooling breaks’ at the World Cup.

It was expected that such intervals would occur during every game of the tournament but FIFA said on Friday that breaks would only be allowed when temperatures exceeded 32C.

That means England and Italy are likely to miss out on such refreshment in Manaus on Saturday night with temperatures forecast for 29C. Humidity is expected to reach 89 per cent and it promises to be an energy-sapping environment for the Europeans.

But a FIFA statement read: ‘Official and mandatory cooling breaks have not been established for the 64 games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, but instead they will be considered on a match-by-match basis.

‘Climate conditions will be evaluated and should the temperature exceed 32 degrees, then the FIFA Venue Medical Office will recommend cooling breaks to the FIFA General Coordinator and Match Commissioner. The implementation of the cooling breaks will reside with the referee.

‘Cooling breaks last three minutes in duration are then implemented by the referee at approximately 30 minutes into the run-of-play in both halves of the match (i.e. around the 30th minute and 75th minute respectively). Three minutes will then be added to stoppage time at the end of each half.’

Three-minute breaks are at referee's discretion but only once temperatures exceed 32C
