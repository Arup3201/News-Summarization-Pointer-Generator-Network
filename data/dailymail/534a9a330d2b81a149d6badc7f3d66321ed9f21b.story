A mother has spoken of her horror after her three-year-old daughter bit into a Greggs pasty - to find a rubber glove inside.

Mother-of-one Karly Hodson, 29, bought the £1.20 cheese and onion pasty as a treat for her daughter Amber on Thursday morning.

But as they were driving home from the bakery in Forest Gate, east London, Amber discovered the blue plastic, narrowly avoiding eating it by accident.

'A mother's worst nightmare': Karly Hodson's three-year-old daughter Amber bit into a Greggs pasty to find a blue rubber glove inside

Ms Hodson bought the pasty for Amber as a treat but says she is unlikely to ever go back to Greggs 

Choking hazard: Ms Hodson says her daughter could have choked on the blue plastic inside the pasty

Fortunately the three-year-old spotted the blue glove in the nick of time, but her traumatised mother says her daughter could have choked.

Ms Hodson, a nursery assistant, told MailOnline: 'I pulled away and she said, "Mummy, what's this?". I said, "Amber, it's a pasty!". She said, "But Mummy, it's blue!". I looked and it was a rubber glove. 

'God forbid if she hadn't seen that rubber glove she could have choked - and I was driving.' 

'If she hadn't noticed it, you never know what could've happened. It could've been a mother's worse nightmare.'

When she got home, a 'fuming' Ms Hodson complained to Greggs but has only received an email in reply so far.

'All I've had is an email, saying send in the pasty so they can carry out an analysis,' she said.

Greggs sent an email to apologise to the traumatised mother but Ms Hodson says that is not good enough

'They've just said sorry, but sorry's not good enough. It's not the first time it's happened, I've got friends who've had the same thing.

'I don't think I'm ever going to eat there again. It's made me feel ill - that's been on someone's hand, you don't know what germs are on it.

'It wasn't a hot pasty either, because my daughter bit into it straight away, so who knows what germs could be in there.'

A spokesman for Greggs said: 'We’re really sorry to hear of this complaint and will investigate every possibility. We have rigorous quality control checks in place before sending our products out to our shops and will be looking at how this could have happened.'
