A little boy will be able to eat chocolate again this Christmas after he received a new kidney from his father.

William Balestrini, three, will be able to tuck into the treat after recovering from a rare condition which made it dangerous for him to eat it.

William, from Crawley, West Sussex, was born with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease – ARPKD - but has now recovered thanks to a kidney transplant.

William Balestrini, three, has autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease which causes cysts to form of the kidneys damaging the tissue. In severe cases, it leads to kidney failure

His condition stopped him from eating a variety of foods including chocolate, cheese and yoghurt.

This is because they contain minerals, such as phosphate, which his failing kidneys were unable to clear from his body. 

Too much phosphate can cause the 
parathyroid gland to secrete a hormone which causes calcium to be 
leached out of the bones causing rickets, poor growth and bone 
fractures.

William's mother, Nancy Rattner, 24, said: ‘It was difficult, because he was so poorly and the only foods he wanted to eat were foods that would harm him.

'We are going all out this Christmas and I just cannot wait.

‘To be able to watch Will really enjoy himself, and tuck into his favourite treats is going to be fantastic.

William had to have a very restricted diet as his failing kidneys were not able to filter excess minerals from his body. He is now able to eat normally after receiving a new kidney from his father

William's parents, Nancy and James, were told before his birth that he might have kidney problems as a scan showed that the organs were slightly enlarged

‘I've already put the decorations up and I can't wait to spoil Will and his brother.

‘Before
 the op Will could barely eat anything - it was hard, because he used to
 get given chocolate all the time and couldn't eat it. But now, he loves
 the stuff.

‘It's great to see him tucking into his favourite food now and really enjoying it.

‘This Christmas will be the first year he eats a Christmas dinner too – we can't wait.’

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a rare genetic childhood condition which causes cysts to grow in the kidneys and damage them.

Symptoms of ARPKD include high blood pressure, kidney disease and liver disease.

In the most severe cases, children with the condition do not survive for more than a few weeks.

Children with less severe ARPKD sometimes lose all of their kidney function by their teens.

If this happens, they will need either dialysis or a transplant.

It is estimated that one in 20,000 babies are born with the condition.

Children with ARPKD are often unable to eat a wide range of foods, including chocolate, because their failing kidneys are unable to filter excess minerals from their bodies.

Of particular concern are phosphate-rich foods because excess phosphate can build up in the blood of people with kidney failure.

This is serious because it causes the parathyroid gland to secrete a hormone caused PTH which causes calcium to be leached out of bones.

This can cause rickets, poor growth and bone fractures.

Ms Rattner and partner James, 32, discovered their oldest son might have a kidney condition at their 23 week scan.

Ms Rattner said: ‘We knew Will may be ill very early on, as scans showed that his kidneys were slightly enlarged.

‘But none of the doctors could say for sure, and there was a nine out of ten chance that he would be ok.

‘When he was born, he seemed fine and the initial tests were clear, so we thought we were lucky.’

But at just 14 hours old, little Will took a turn for the worse.

Ms Rattner said: ‘I was trying to feed him and all of a sudden he went blue and started to shake.

‘We were then told that he had low blood sugar and had some sort of kidney problem.

‘It was devastating. He was hooked up to loads of machines and you could actually feel his kidneys through his stomach.

‘Our lives suddenly took a dramatic turn and it soon became clear that he wasn't well at all.’

William was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where his parents were told the shocking news that their son had ARPKD, and he may need a kidney transplant.

The potentially fatal condition causes cysts to appear in the kidneys damaging them. It can also cause damage to the liver.

Ms Rattner said: ‘We just couldn't believe it.

‘I'd been told that going to Great Ormond Street would be the last resort, and then here we were. Everything was just crashing around me.’

Luckily, doctors were able to stabilise William, increasing his kidney function.

William (pictured with his parents, Nancy and James, and his brother, Arthur) was diagnosed with ARPKD after he turned blue and started shaking when he was just a few hours old

William (pictured after his transplant) received a new kidney when he was just two years old. Both of his parents were eligible to donate but his mother, Nancy, became pregnant with his brother

His mother said: ‘Eventually we were discharged and for eight months everything was fine.

‘But after one of his check-ups we were told he was getting worse again.

‘We rushed back to hospital and Will was transferred to the pre-transplant clinic.

‘I looked at my little baby and just couldn't believe he needed such a huge operation.’

Ms Rattner said: 'It was a very scary time. To watch them both go through surgery was just petrifying. I had to say goodbye to Will on my own as James was in theatre and it was awful'

Immediately, his parents began investigations to determine whether they could donate their own kidneys to their little boy.

Both were a match, but Ms Rattner became pregnant with the couple's second child, Arthur, so it was decided that her partner should donate.

In October last year, when Will was just two years old, the toddler and his father underwent surgery.

Ms Rattner said: ‘It was a very scary time. To watch them both go through surgery was just petrifying.

‘I had to say goodbye to Will on my own as James was in theatre and it was awful. I gave him a little kiss and a cuddle - I was so emotional.

‘It was all a bit of a blur to be honest but they both did so well, I'm so proud of them.’

The transplant was a success and William was out of hospital in ten days, but due to follow up tests over Christmas, the family never got to celebrate.

Ms Rattner said: ‘We were in hospital on Christmas Eve, so the festive period wasn't too fun for us last year.

‘For the first six months after the operation I was always on edge, worried that something would go wrong again.

‘But this year, it's going to be different - I can't wait to spoil Will after all he's been through.

‘There's a chance that he might be lactose intolerant but we'll find a way around it, I can't deprive him of chocolate again.’

Ms Rattner says this year she is determined to spoil William at Christmas to make up for everything he has been through

Tess Harris, chairman of the Polycystic Kidney Disease Charity, said: ‘It's a rare inherited condition, inherited from parents who are carriers.

‘ARPKD is a severe disease but about 8 in 10 babies who survive the first four weeks of life are still alive at five years old. Research continues into finding new therapies but is hampered by lack of funding by government.

‘Sufferers of it feel unwell, have tiredness. Anaemia is also a big problem and very high blood pressure can bring risk of heart disease and a stroke.

‘They may also need dialysis treatment as the kidneys stop doing its job removing toxins from the blood.’
