Peter Chapman took to Facebook to rant after he received slow service in a Costa Coffee in Dorchester, Dorset

A Conservative councillor is being urged to resign after he branded coffee shop staff 'bone idle bitches' who 'needed a good beating'.

Peter Chapman took to social networking site Facebook to complain after he received slow service in a Costa Coffee.

He posted a message slating the members of staff at the branch in Dorchester, Dorset.

His message read: 'Terminally slow (and bad) service from the bone idle bitches at Costa Dorchester today, they all need a good beating.'

Visitors to his personal Facebook page were horrified by his remarks and are now urging Mr Chapman to resign from Weymouth and Portland Borough Council.

Mr Chapman, who has been a councillor for five years, has since tried to back-track from his comments which he said were made in jest.

He said: 'My Facebook status is private and that comment was not made in public.'

But a local womens' rights group has branded the comments as 'terrible'.

Toni McKee, chairman of Women's Action Network Dorset, said: 'I think this is absolutely terrible and there are no grounds for even joking about something like that.

'We are working so hard to break the perception that domestic violence is acceptable, so it is shocking that someone in a public position should say something like this.

The councillor made the comments about the staff in the Costa in Dorchester, Dorset

'I think he should step down.'

Gemma Stephenson, assistant manager at the Costa Coffee shop in Dorchester, said the remarks were 'shocking'.

She added: 'It's not a nice thing for anyone to say, and definitely not something a councillor should be saying.'

Alison Moore, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Dorchester, said: 'I do not know the man but he should consider apologising.

'I can understand the frustration when you are in a queue and it's busy but that is a really unacceptable thing to say and I'm quite shocked.

'If it was a genuine mistake then he should think about how he might be able to repair the damage.'Â
