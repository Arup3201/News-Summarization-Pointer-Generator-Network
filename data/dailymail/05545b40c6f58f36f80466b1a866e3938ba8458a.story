Comedian Roseanne Barr sent Twitter into a frenzy, after she posted a photo of her bloody and swollen face on Twitter, with a caption blaming her injuries on a 'tussle with Bill Cosby'.

The 62-year-old, best known for starring alongside John Goodman in her self-titled sitcom that ran for nine seasons until 1997, tweeted: 'Got in a tussle w bill cosby. U shoyld see that mfer.'

She quickly deleted the bizarre tweet and replaced it with another stating: 'Got a chemical peel to look more sexier. Joked about tussling cosby (sic).'

But not before the comedian had thrown a number of her 263,000 Twitter followers into a frenzy of confusion, with many not quite getting the joke.

While some noted that Roseanne's apparent injuries looked more like the result of cosmetic surgery than a scuffle, others responded with genuine concern and seemed to take the post seriously. 

One commentator asked: 'Are you for real or do you have a great make up artist?'

Another stated: WHOA did Roseanne Barr really get attacked I hope she's joking

'Very confused by what's going on on @therealroseanne's Twitter right now,' a third Twitter user posted after the graphic photo emerged on the site.

Speaking to the New York Daily News just days earlier, Roseanne had weighed in on sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby.

'I don't wanna get sued or have him (Cosby) send anyone to beat me up, but I think it's obvious: 13 to 1,' she told the newspaper.

At least 13 women have come forward claiming they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions.

Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her.

Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, also claimed that Cosby tried to attack her during a gathering at his house in 1967.

The comedian has never been charged and his lawyers have said the assault claims were discredited.

Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer has branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'.
