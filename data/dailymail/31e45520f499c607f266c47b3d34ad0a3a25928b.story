A snowstorm hammered the Great Plains
on Monday, unleashing snow and fierce winds that turned roads to ice, 
reduced visibility to zero and jeopardized thousands of holiday 
motorists' travel plans just two days before the official start of 
winter.

The storm was blamed for a fatal 
accident in eastern Colorado, where a guard and an inmate were killed 
when a prison van lost control along an icy highway.

Eight other inmates and a prison 
employee were hospitalized with moderate to serious injuries, according 
to the Colorado State Patrol.

Batten down the hatches: The snow will move north and east by Wednesday

National Guard troops and sheriff's deputies in the Texas Panhandle were called out on nearly 100 rescues after Interstate 40, a major east-west route, was closed Monday night from Amarillo into New Mexico.

No injuries were immediately reported and several shelters were being set up, Oldham County sheriff's dispatchers said.

From northern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle through Oklahoma and northwestern Kansas, blizzard conditions put state road crews on alert and had motorists taking refuge and early exits off major roads.

The snow started falling on Santa Fe on Monday, seen here, and meteorologists warn that the snow and wind could make holiday travel dangerous, and even impossible, for some people

In northern New Mexico, snow and ice forced the closure of all roads from the town of Raton to the Texas and Oklahoma borders about 90 miles away. Hotels in Clayton, N.M., just east of where the three states touch, were nearly full.

Linda Pape, general manager of the Clayton Super 8 motel said it was packed with unhappy skiers who had been headed to lodges in Colorado and elsewhere in New Mexico.

'They lost a day or two of skiing, and they had budgeted an amount of money they were going to spend, and now they have to spend more staying somewhere else,' she said.

Pape said it's not uncommon for skiers to get stuck in Clayton during the winter, and she keeps two freezers and a refrigerator stocked in case roads are closed.

Terrible visibility: Traffic on the I-25 in New Mexico

Heavy fall: Snow is cleared in Santa Fe, New Mexico on Tuesday afternoon

'They are not happy, but we are not letting them go hungry,' she said.

The storm came after much of the country had a relatively mild fall. With the exception of the October snowstorm blamed for 29 deaths on the East Coast, there's been little rain or snow.

Many of the areas hit Monday enjoyed relatively balmy 60-degree temperatures just 24 hours earlier.

The snow moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle early Monday morning, and 1.5 inches accumulated in about an hour, said Vicki Roberts, who owns the Black Mesa Bed and Breakfast in Kenton. Her inn sits at the base of the 4,973-foot-tall Black Mesa, the highest point in Oklahoma. Looking out her window, she couldn't see it.

'I have a mail route and I'm not going,' Roberts said. 'You just don't get out in this. We'll be socked in here. If we lose power, we'll just read a book in front of the fireplace.'

Disruptions: A woman walks her dog on an uncleared sidewalk as snow covered cars pass her by

Travel throughout the region was difficult. New Mexico shut down a portion of Interstate 25, the major route heading northeast of Santa Fe into Colorado, and Clayton police dispatcher Cindy Blackwell said her phones were 'ringing off the hook' with calls from numerous motorists stuck on rural roads.

Bill Cook, who works at the Best Western in Clayton, said he hadn't seen such a storm since the 1970s, when cattle had to be airlifted with helicopters and the National Guard was called in to help out. His hotel was packed Monday with people 'happy they have a room,' and some of the children were playing outside in the snow.

Keith Barras, the owner of the Eklund Hotel, a landmark in Clayton since the 1890s, said guests were happily milling around the lobby and he expected to be full by nightfall.

'We have lots of board games, one of our customers has a guitar, we have a piano, so there'll be a party tonight,' Barras said.

Though some drivers were inconvenienced, farmers and meteorologists said the storm was bringing much needed moisture - first rain, then snow as temperatures dropped - to areas of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas that had been parched by a drought that started in the summer of 2010.

The big chill: The snow blowers were out clearing sidewalks in Santa Fe as dusk began to fall on Tuesday

Virginia Kepley, 73, spent Monday afternoon baking pumpkin bread to give as Christmas gifts while snow fell on her farm near Ulysses, Kansas.

'I decided to try to get as much done today in case the electricity goes off and I can't make it tomorrow,' she said.

Kepley was grateful for the snow after some of her family's wheat never got enough moisture to sprout last season. A new crop had been planted in the fall for harvest next summer.

'It is wonderful for the wheat,' Kepley said. 'At least we have wheat we can see this year.'

Shut down: Schools closed as the storm moved across New Mexico towards Texas and Oklahoma

In the Texas Panhandle, hotels were quickly filling up after I-40 and a handful of roadways heading north into Oklahoma were closed.

The last available room was booked by 7pm at the Best Western Country Inn along I-40 in Vega, about 30 miles west of Amarillo, as blowing snow severely restricted visibility on the highway, hotel clerk Lena Patel said.

'I don't see anything,' she said, looking from the front window from the front desk.

Long haul truck driver Frank Pringle stopped at a Love's Travel Stop in Amarillo earlier in the day, saying he intended to go as far west as road conditions would allow Monday.

Slippery conditions: Parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Colorado were under blizzard watches or warnings this afternoon

Blizzard: More than a foot of snow and wind gusts of 50 miles per hour are predicted for some parts of the southwest and plains by Tuesday morning

His biggest worry was with four-wheel-drive cars because 'they will shoot past you and cut you off and you have to hit your brakes. And hitting brakes in the snow is not a good thing."In the coming days up to 18 inches of snow is expected 
in northeastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, 
southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado, which were under blizzard
watches or warnings today through Wednesday.

Weather service forecaster Kerry 
Jones in Albuquerque, New Mexico is warned people in the region not to 
be fooled by pleasant weather - the storm is potentially life-threatening and the snow started falling quickly on Monday.

'Those are tremendous amounts of 
snow,' Jones said. 'Add to that the fact that that snow is going to be 
blowing, and you're going to have winds easily in the 40 mph range if 
not higher, it's going to be a very ugly, potentially life-threatening 
situation.'

'We try to reserve these blizzard watches for very intense storm systems,' he added.
