Sergeant Blackman is said to have been devastated by the death of his wheelchair-bound father shortly before the tour of Afghanistan that was to end in shame. Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011.

A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan.

Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later.

Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora.

Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra.

Fighting had been intense, with an 
officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While 
leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle, 
his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the 
warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle.

Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them.

After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion.

His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered.

Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling.

Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan.

After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton.

Highly regarded by senior officers, 
Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its 
discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full 
during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011.

He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily.

Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll.

During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire.

Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty

He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents.

‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’

The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant.

It would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the Helmand execution discovered on his laptop.
