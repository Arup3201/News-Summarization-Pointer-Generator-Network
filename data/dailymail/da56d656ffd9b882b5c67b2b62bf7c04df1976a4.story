Amazon's streaming box, Fire TV, will launch in the UK in October.

The device, which allows users to access on-demand TV, apps and smartphone content as well as games, debuted in the US in April.

It will compete with the Apple TV box and Google’s Chromebox, but the tech giant says that none of the current TV boxes give consumers what they really want.

Setting the world alight? Amazon's streaming box, Fire TV (pictured) will launch in the UK on October 23. The  device allows users to access on-demand TV, apps and smartphone content as well as games

Speaking on the first day of the IFA technology show in Berlin, senior vice president of devices David Limp said: ‘We think that the products that are out there - and we sell a lot of them on Amazon - just haven't offered customers the value that we think you can, and this is an existence proof that you can put a lot of horsepower and performance into a box, at a great value.’

The Fire TV box will be shipped in Europe on October 23. It can be pre-ordered for £79 and Amazon Prime members can pre-order it for £49 for five days. The device will also be available at Argos, Dixons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco.

Talking it up: Amazon said voice search (illustrated) will allow users to say the name of a film, TV show or actor, for example into their remote to find a film. This means no more scrolling through an alphabetical grid

Users will be able to buy a separate controller and download games to play through Fire TV (shown). ‘It doesn't replace an Xbox or a Playstation. There's a group of customers who live and die by those things, but there is a segment of customers that we think is out there that don't make the leap to those consoles,’ Mr Limp said

Processor: Quad core with three times the processing power of Apple TV

Memory: 2GB – four times that of Apple TV or Chromecast

Operating system: Fire OS, based on Android 

Streaming: High definition up to 1080p with Support for Dolby Digital Plus Surround Sound.

Set-up: Box comes pre-registered so there’s no set-up. Previously purchased films and TV shows from Amazon will automatically be places in a Watchlist.

Amazon said that the box is designed to offer users access to films and bring photos, music and games to the living room in one place.

As well as Netflix and Prime Instant Video, owners of the new box will be able to access Sky News, YouTube as well as music services - Amazon Music, Spotify and TuneIn.

Voice search will allow users to say the name of a film, TV show or actor, for example into their remote to find a film. This means no more scrolling through an alphabetical grid. 

A function called ASAP (Advanced Streaming and Prediction) will suggest films and TV shows that people will want to watch and buffers them for playback before a user hits play.

For film buffs, there’s a feature called X-Ray where they can see information about the cast and crew as well as movie trivia.

Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO said: ‘Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price- customers love Fire TV and we’re thrilled to introduce it in the UK.

‘Voice search that actually works means no more typing on an alphabet grid. Our exclusive new ASAP feature predicts the shows you’ll want to watch and gets them ready to stream instantly. And our open approach gives you not just Amazon Instant Video and Prime Instant Video, but also Netflix, Sky News, YouTube, Spotify, and more.’ 

Users will be able to buy a separate controller for £34.99 and download games to play through Fire TV. 

Game on: The controller needed to play video games will be sold separately to the Fire TV box, and will cost £34.99 each. Hundreds games, such as Minecraft, Asphalt 8, NBA 2K14, and The Walking Dead will be available when the box launches next month

No need to flap: With the addition of a controller, Fire TV owners will be able to play games on their TV.  A new multiplayer version of the popular Flappy Bird app (pictured) will be exclusively available to Fire TV

‘It doesn't replace an Xbox or a Playstation. There's a group of customers who live and die by those things, but there is a segment of customers that we think is out there that don't make the leap to those consoles,’ Mr Limp said.

A new multiplayer version of the popular Flappy Bird app will be exclusively available to Fire TV.

Hundreds of high-quality, low-cost games, such as Minecraft, Asphalt 8, NBA 2K14, and The Walking Dead will be available at launch too, with the average game costing £1.07.

The device has a quad-core processor with three times the processing power of Apple TV and four times the memory of Apple and Google’s offerings, so it’s faster and more fluid, according to Amazon.
