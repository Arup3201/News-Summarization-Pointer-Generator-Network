Emergency crews were called to a Pittsburgh apartment on Monday morning after neighbors complained about smelling natural gas and the owner is blaming his cat.

Patrick Bookout left his pet, Bugera, home alone for the weekend. He estimates that at some point  the feline must have hit a burner knob with his paw when he climbed onto the stove looking for food.

Fortunately nobody was hurt after Bookout's upstairs neighbors smelled the gas and called 911 on Monday morning.

‘He runs out of food because he’s a little piggy and he hops up on the fridge. When he jumps up, he has to hit the stove, he hits the burner and it’s on,’ Bookout told KDKA.

Bookout says he wasn’t surprised to hear about the smell of gas in the building when he returned home on Monday morning, since it isn’t the first time that his mischievous cat has turned a burner on.

‘It was only a couple months ago I came home from work and the burner on my stove was on,’ he said. 'Now the arson department is at my house, and my cat’s the culprit.'

Arson investigators were checking out the incident.

According to Bookout, he is going to make some changes inside the apartment to ensure it doesn’t happen again.

'I’m going to take the handle off the stove, and probably leave him outside every day I’m not home,' he said.

Bugera was a stray before Bookout offered him a home.
