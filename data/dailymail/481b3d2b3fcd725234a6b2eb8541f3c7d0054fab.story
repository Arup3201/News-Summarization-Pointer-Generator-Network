This is the moment two teenage gangs armed with knives and a hammer clashed outside a city centre hotel in front of terrified families. 

A gun was fired and an innocent teenage girl was battered to the ground as children watched on in horror while the group of thugs brawled in the streets of Wolverhampton on April 9 last year.

Footage taken on a mobile phone captured the horrifying scenes as they unfolded outside the Britannia Hotel.

Two of the group are then filmed calmly leaving the three star hotel shortly after as onlookers rush to help the two injured females as they lie in the street.

The innocent girls were part of a group who had just arrived in the city to enjoy a night out but found themselves thrust into the middle of the gangland row.

Armed police rushed to lock down the city centre following the disorder which involved at least 15 gang members.

The injured girl was taken to hospital with back and leg injuries alongside a teenage boy who was treated for stab wounds.

On Friday  two of the gang, who cannot be named, were found guilty of taking part in the violence at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

A 16-year-old boy was found guilty of possessing an imitation firearm with intent while a 17-year-old was found guilty of possessing a knife.

Two teenagers have previously admitted their involvement in the incident which was caught on camera at an earlier court hearing.

Nathaniel Nugent, 18, from Blurton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, admitted possession of a knife and affray in August last year.

A 16-year-old boy. from Wolverhampton, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to possession of a hammer and affray.

The four teenagers, who were granted bail, are all facing jail when they are sentenced next month.

During the trial, Philip Beardwell, prosecuting, described the brawl as 'a very serious and ugly incident of public disorder'.

The court heard how a group of five girls heading for a night out in the city after arriving at the bus station were enveloped by the youths fighting in the street.

The 17-year-old was seen waving a knife around moments before the girls heard a gunshot.

The 16-year-old was then seen with what appeared to be a firearm that was then pointed at three of the girls.

Giving evidence, a 17-year-old girl said she had seen a group of around 15 youths running towards the Prince Albert pub and then back towards the Britannia Hotel

Neither the knife nor the gun was found but a blank bullet casing was recovered from the scene.

Mr Beardwell said it could not be proved that a real gun was involved and added 'but you can be sure that it was at least an imitation firearm.'

Giving evidence, a 17-year-old girl said she had seen a group of around 15 youths running towards the Prince Albert pub and then back towards the Britannia Hotel.

She told the court: 'One of them came towards one of my friends who was standing behind me.'

'He was swinging a hammer and shouting threats at my friend.

'He said he was going to hit her with the hammer. I am sure he said he was going to kill her.

'As he raised the hammer in the air I grabbed his arm.

'We were pushing each other and I dropped to the floor. As that happened one of his friends kicked me hard in the ribs knocking the breath our of me.

'Then the youth with the hammer who had fallen over with me got up and hit me with it on the spine quite hard.

'I was curled up in a ball and stayed there for five or 10 minutes.'

Witness Mark Tobin, deputy manager of the Britannia Hotel, told the court: 'A boy about 15 to 16-years-old came from the direction of the Prince Albert Pub.

The court heard how a group of five girls heading for a night out in the city after arriving at the bus station were enveloped by the youths fighting in the street outside the hotel (file picture)

'I heard him say in a local accent, 'Get here blud, you've had it - I'm going to get you'.

'He was holding a lump hammer.

'He held it in his left hand by his leg. I thought something was about to happen.

'He was about 20ft to 30ft away. I saw two females and around 12 males just outside the restaurant. They looked 14 to 18-years-old.

'As I came closer, I heard lots of shouting and screaming. I can't recall what was being said. I saw a male swinging a hammer around aggressively.

'He grabbed one of the females with his left hand by her hair.

'He was swinging her around by her hair trying to get her to the floor. He was swinging the hammer around but I couldn't tell if it hit her. She was trying to fight him off.

'Another male had his hand up and something black was in his hand but I couldn't see what it was.

'I heard a bang which was like a firearm.

'It was a similar sound to when I have been clay pigeon shooting. There was smoke.'

They four will be sentenced at the same court on March 6.
