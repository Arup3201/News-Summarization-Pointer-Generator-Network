Black Friday is named after the day of frenzied shopping in the US after Thanksgiving when retailers traditionally started making a profit, or went into ‘the black’.

The concept was introduced to Britain by online sites like Amazon in 2010, but gained momentum last year when Walmart-owned Asda slashed its prices on electrical goods, leading to scuffles in stores.

British shoppers are expected to spend £363million online alone on Friday, an 11 per cent increase on 2012, according to the Centre for Retail Research. 

The online store has also hired more than 13,000 people across the UK for seasonal positions with the company in their fulfilment and customer service centres

Black Friday, will be closely followed by Cyber Monday on December 1, marking the busiest online shopping period with just 29 shopping days left until Christmas

Last year during Black Friday, Amazon.co.uk saw more than 4.1 million items ordered at a rate of around 47 items per second, with sales peaking at 9.22pm.

During its busiest 24 hour period last year, a delivery lorry left one of Amazon's eight warehouses on average every 1 minute 33 seconds.

Now some online stores are now expecting the day to outstrip next week’s Cyber Monday as the biggest online shopping event of the year.

Xavier Garambois, vice president of EU Retail at Amazon said: 'Whilst Cyber Monday has always been our biggest single day for sales, the growing success of Black Friday illustrates that it has become a much-anticipated date as the nation prepares for the festive season.

'We first brought Black Friday to the UK in 2010 with 300 deals, now we are offering over 3,000 deals and for many, Black Friday marks the start of the Christmas shopping rush in the UK.'

The top most wanted toys this year include the Barbie Endless Curls doll, Disney Frozen ice skating Anna and Elsa dolls, the Girl Tech Password Journal, the KidiZoom Smart Watch and Lego Star Wars.

This Christmas Amazon will distribute customer orders from eight UK fulfilment centres with a combined size of almost five million square feet.

They have also hired more than 13,000 people across the UK for seasonal positions in fulfilment and customer service centres, with an additional 1,000 permanent roles to soon be created too.
