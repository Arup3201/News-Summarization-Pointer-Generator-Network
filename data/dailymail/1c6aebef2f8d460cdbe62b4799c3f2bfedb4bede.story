John Carver said Sir Bobby Robson would be his inspiration in winning the Newcastle manager’s job on a permanent basis, but this was more like Kevin Keegan’s nerve-shredding Entertainers.

At times, the performance was brilliant, at others baffling. Crucially, though, Keegan’s swashbucklers of the mid Nineties invariably scored one more than the opposition.

But to share six goals with relegation candidates Burnley – three times squandering the lead – was not what caretaker boss Carver had hoped for in part one of his audition for the leading role at his hometown club.

In the end, the Magpies were fortunate to escape with a point. Four times Sean Dyche’s side cracked the woodwork and the St James’ Park crowd grumbled their irritation on full-time at the surrender of maximum points.

Carver – in charge with Alan Pardew having quit for Crystal Palace - concedes he was mystified by his side’s collapse.

‘It was like the old days when Kevin (Keegan) was manager,’ reflected Carver, who revealed he has lost Steven Taylor to an achilles injury for the remainder of the season.

‘I’ve never been involved in a football match where that cliche of two halves was so apparent.

‘That was some of the best football we’ve played in the first half. We could have been two or three up. We passed it well, our movement was good and we were positive.

‘But they were direct in the second half and we did not know how to deal with their approach.

‘I’m so disappointed because we were so good in the first half and so poor the second. We were lucky to get away with a point. Burnley should have won the game.

‘If I was a Newcastle fan sitting in the stand then I’d be going to the pub and I’d be disappointed.’

Taylor, Jack Colback and Moussa Sissoko had given United the lead, but on each occasion the Clarets found an equaliser.

Their final leveller came four minutes from time when George Boyd smashed through the weak grasp of rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick. Earlier, a Paul Dummett own goal and Danny Ings’ fifth of the season had restored parity.

Burnley came from two down to claim a point at Manchester City on Sunday and, while they still remain in the drop zone, Dyche – who was forced into three changes before half-time - has reason for positivity.

‘It was interesting day at office, I’ve never experienced losing three players to illness or injury so early in the game,’ he said.

‘But I could not be more proud of the players. Some of our quality was outstanding.

‘Newcastle were excellent for 25 minutes. But our response just shows the unshakable desire and belief we have in each other.

‘Manuel Pellegrini said how bright we were in our forward play the other day and I’m happy with the energy and endeavour of the team.

‘My belief is still there that we will stay up.’

It had been an absorbing affair. The game was just 54 seconds old when Ings sprung Ashley Barnes clear and his stab cannoned off the upright with Alnwick beaten.

But it was Newcastle who seized the lead. They went two years without netting from a corner under Pardew and he had even ordered his analysis staff to produce a report of all goals from flag-kicks in the Premier League in a bid to find a scoring formula.

Jack Colback became the first Newcastle player to score and provide an assist in the same league game this season.

It didn’t work. Under Carver, though, it took just 15 minutes. Colback delivered from the right and Taylor rose to glance home from six yards.

Within four minutes the visitors were level, Dummett inadvertently nodding a dropping ball over Alnwick and into his own net from 10 yards.

No matter, the mood during those early exchanges dictated that Carver’s team would simply go in search of another and they were duly back in front on 26 minutes. Daryl Janmaat rolled a short pass to Colback and he laced delightfully into the bottom corner from 25 yards. But that was where their dominance faded.

Within minutes of the restart after half-time the outstanding Ings sized a curler from the edge of the area and, when that cracked the underside of the bar and bounced out, Barnes headed against the base of the post before a relieved Alnwick smothered.

Again Newcastle needed the frame of the goal to preserve their lead when Ben Mee’s header – from David Jones’ corner – smashed the crossbar.

The pressure eventually told. Michael Kightly swept over a cross from the left and Ings, peeling off Dummett, flicked his header into the bottom corner.

At this juncture you’d wager on only one side scoring again, and it wasn’t Newcastle.

In Ayoze Perez, though, they have unearthed a star. And it was the Spaniard’s jinking run and cross – mishit by Adam Armstrong – which allowed Sissoko to steam in and place beyond Heaton.

But Burnley did not deserve defeat and so it was that Boyd pounced as they again came from behind to claim an invaluable point in their fight for survival.

For Carver, he was just relieved it had not been all three.
