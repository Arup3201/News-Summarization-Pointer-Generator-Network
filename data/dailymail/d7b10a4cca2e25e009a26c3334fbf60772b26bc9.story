Gabriel Paulista has made the right impression on his Arsenal team-mates even if he doesn't understand a word most of them are saying.

Brazilian centre half Gabriel made his debut against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Sunday after completing a move last month from Villarreal in Spain.

Arsene Wenger claimed he had played 'with the handbrake on' but was able to contribute to a clean sheet as holders Arsenal won 2-0 to reach the quarter finals.

Kieran Gibbs said: 'I felt he came in on his debut and did extremely well. He looks like he has been playing at this level for a long time. He has settled in straight away which is good for us. 

'At this stage of the season, we don't want to have any excuses that we fell short from injuries. It is nice to know that we have got a good solid central defence who are all available.

'He doesn't speak any English at the moment and it was the same with Alexis when he came. It won't take him long. We've brushed him up on a few of the sayings for him to get used to.

'There's some pointing and shouting because in training and stuff in the week, Steve [Bould] goes through it with him with one of the Spanish boys who then translates for him what it means in English so he understands when it is said to him on the pitch he knows what to do. That's what is starts from and to get a good understanding it is important.

'One of the biggest things that I've realised from the Boro game from him that he embraces the physical side of the game. That's what we want from a centre-half.'
