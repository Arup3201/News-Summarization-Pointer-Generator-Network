At just 7ft wide, there's barely room to swing a cat.

But there's nothing miniscule about the asking price for this narrow slice of a Victorian terrace near London's Olympic Park.

The curious property, barely wider than it’s own front door, is on the market for £275,000 - three times what it was bought for in February last year.

Estate agents describe the renovated two-bedroom property in Homerton High Street, Hackney, as an 'ideal first-time purchase or rental investment'.

The asking price reflects the east London area's newly buoyant property market, they say.

Details released by the estate agents show a picture of the property's facade but do not mention its modest dimensions.

Before and now: Estate agents say the renovated property in Homerton High Street, Hackney, is an 'ideal first-time purchase or rental investment'

They describe the sale as 'a 
unique opportunity to acquire this beautifully designed, two-storey, end-of-terrace freehold house, with much thought having been given to space 
and light'.

They say the house is within 'easy reach of both the refreshing green spaces of the 
Marshes and Victoria Park, and a host of transport links at hand 
including Homerton overground station, giving swift City access'.

A floorplan shows the property, which was bought at auction for £92,000, covers an area of 703 square feet.

Amazingly, however, it is by no means the narrowest property in Britain.

In 2010, the Daily Mail reported on a house in the Hollingdean area of Brighton that was only 6ft wide and 21ft from front to back.

Yet in that tiny space was an entrance hall, kitchen and shower room on the ground floor, a first-floor living room and a bedroom in the eaves.

The former donkey-cart shed was thought to be Britain's narrowest inhabited terrace home.

The Wedge, off Scotland’s North Ayrshire 
coast, measures just 47 inches at the front - but spreads to 22ft as it 
moves back from the road. It was sold as a holiday home in 2000 for 
£27,000.

And last year, the Mail reported on New York's skinniest house going on sale for a whopping $4.3m - twice what it sold for in 2010.

Once home to Cary Grant and a modern tourist attraction in its own right, number 75 1/2 Bedford St  measures just 9.5ft wide and 30ft deep.

Along with Grant, the property has been home to actor John Barrymore, poet Edna St Vincent Millay and cartoonist William Steig - none of whom, it seems, ever suffered from claustrophobia.

Meanwhile, it emerged last year that a Polish architect was building the world's narrowest house between Warsaw tower blocks, measuring just 60 inches wide.

The four-storey home comes complete with a bedroom, lounge, bathroom and kitchen, stretching back nearly 40ft.

Instead of the traditional staircase, each floor is accessed by a ladder.
