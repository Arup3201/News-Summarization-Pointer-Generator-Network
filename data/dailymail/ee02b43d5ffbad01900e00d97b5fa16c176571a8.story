Aidy Boothroyd enjoyed the perfect start to his tenure as England Under 20 manager as Romania were hit for six in Telford on Friday night.

With Roy Hodgson watching on from the stands, goals from Rolando Aarons, Josh Murphy, Lewis Baker, Kwame Thomas and two from Callum Robinson - all in the second-half - ensured a great start to the season.

It had taken England some time to get into their groove but once Newcastle star Aarons opened the scoring on 54 minutes, goals followed at regular intervals.

Scorers: Aarons 54; Murphy 71; Robinson 73, 89; Baker 78 pen; Thomas 85

Aarons, who impressed on his Premier League debut for Newcastle against Crystal Palace last weekend, was part of an attacking quartet that also included in-form Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom, Liverpool’s Jordon Ibe and Aston Villa man Robinson.

England were on top from the first whistle but, despite seeing plenty of the ball, it took 27 minutes to muster a meaningful chance. Chelsea prodigy Baker curled a free-kick from the left corner of the box that looked bound for the top corner before goalkeeper Razvan Began tipped it over the bar.

It really was a matter of time before the hosts broke the deadlock at the New Bucks Head and Aarons, who scored one and created another on his Newcastle debut at the weekend, duly obliged.

Southampton’s Matt Targett and Chelsea’s John Swift combined down the left and Aarons held off his marker inside the box to fire the ball in off the post.

The floodgates duly opened and England went on to score five more times within the space of 18 minutes. Boothroyd bolstered the forward line by introducing Norwich City’s Murphy, Derby’s Thomas and Southampton man Harrison Reed and Romania had no answer.

Murphy’s strike to make it 2-0 was the pick of the bunch. Targett played a 40-yard ball from left-back and Murphy, watching the ball drop over his shoulder, fired home first-time on the volley.

Two minutes later, Robinson tapped in after Aarons teed him up in front of goal and any doubt over the outcome was removed.

Aarons was then tripped in the box by goalkeeper Began and Baker converted the penalty with aplomb for 4-0.

Cream of the crop: Josh Murphy's strike to make it 2-0 was the best goal of the evening

A late flourish saw further goals from Thomas and Robinson as England capped a memorable victory that gives both Boothroyd and Hodgson optimism going forward.

Boothroyd was understandably delighted after the rout. ‘I couldn’t have wished for a better start. I think it ends off a really good work,’ he told FA.com.

‘I knew we had the players to score, but whilst it’s 1-0 it’s always a little bit sticky and you’ve got to be super-professional and they were.’
