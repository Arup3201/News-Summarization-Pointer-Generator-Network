He might be at the centre of a 'black spider' letter storm but the Prince of Wales appeared to have put the furore behind him as he met children during a visit to Stroud today.

The prince was all smiles as he met stall holders during a tour of the Stroud Festival of Manufacturing and Engineering, and looked impressed when he was shown an engineering project completed by local children.

He also stopped to have his photo taken with two delighted members of the public - and followed it up with a friendly chat.

All smiles: Prince Charles strikes a pose with well-wishers Claire Beard and Emma Goble

Claire Beard and her colleague Emma Goble were touring the festival when they spotted the royal and approached him for a photo to show Ms Beard's mother.

Ms Beard, who works as a front of house receptionist at Stratford Park Leisure Centre, said she addressed the Prince as 'Mr Charles'.

'I asked him if it was allowed and whether I was allowed to touch him,' she said. 'He said it was fine but he asked if I really wanted a picture with him in it. I said that my mum is his biggest fan. He seemed very pleased.'

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she added: 'I’m over the moon that Prince Charles took the time to speak with me and it was an honour to meet the future king. 

'He was very pleasant and extremely friendly.'

Her friend and co-worker, Emma Goble, also a front of house receptionist, added: 'It was fantastic meeting him in the flesh. It was certainly an experience that I’ll treasure and share with my children.'

It is not the first time the Prince has posed for pictures with a member of the public. In July he had his picture taken with scaffolder Sam Wayne during a visit to Newquay, Cornwall.

He also struck a pose with Kent schoolboy Joseph Wilson, 17, who had previously convinced David Cameron to have a selfie with him, during a visit to the flood-hit village of Yalding last year.

Charles officially opened the third Festomane festival - the Stroud Festival of Manufacturing and Engineering - organised by Stroud MP Neil Carmichael. 

He also met Year 8 students from five local schools who were taking part in the Dairy Crest FRijj Challenge to design their own milkshake.

Prior to the Prince’s arrival, the 25 pupils presented their ideas to a panel of judges in a Dragons’ Den-style format.

He later presented the winning students from Maidenhill School with their trophy.

Cutting the ribbon with a pair of Lister shears to open the festival, Charles said: 'I am so encouraged by the so many different stands here and number of companies here doing so well, particularly in the way of exports.

'This country is always renowned as an inventor and it seems we have an enormous pool of talent, and half the battle is harnessing that talent.'

Charles has long had an interest in manufacturing and engineering and supports apprentices in both industries via the Prince's Trust.

He is also a regular visitor to factories and businesses linked to both industries, including, to a Jaguar Land Rover factory in Merseyside for the launch of his Industrial Cadets training programme.

The Stroud Festival of Manufacturing and Engineering  was founded in 2012 to promote Stroud's heritage and showcase local employment and training opportunities - all of which dovetails with Charles' own interests.

Charles is in the middle of a busy run of engagements and, with the Duchess of Cornwall, will visit the West Midlands tomorrow.

He has recently returned from a lengthy trip to Mexico and Colombia, also with the Duchess, and has since tackled a lengthy series of UK based visits.

Most recently, he joined Raymond Blanc for a tour of the National Heritage Garden at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons in Great Milton, Oxfordshire.

Although he looked baffled when the subject of skips were brought into the conversation, Charles, a keen gardener himself, was fascinated by the vast numbers of heritage fruit and vegetable varieties growing in the plot.

In total, the garden has almost 140 rare specimens of vegetable including the Delicata squash and the Carruthers pea.

The site was opened last June to showcase rare varieties of vegetables and educate people about gardening.
