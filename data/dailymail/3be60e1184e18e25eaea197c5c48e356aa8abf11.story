Families have endured a drop in their disposable income for the fifth year running, with an average of £552 lost in the past 12 months, it was revealed today.

In a stark reminder of how bad things have got for British households, one in ten told a survey by the Bank of England they had struggled to pay rent and bills this year.

More than half said their wages had failed to keep pace with inflation, as the cost of living soared and VAT reached 20 per cent.

The number of bill-payers who said they fell behind on payments was 7.5 per cent - almost double the 4.1 per cent it stood at a year ago.

'The environment facing households remains challenging,' concluded the NMG consulting survey for the bank's quarterly bulletin.

A third of workers said they were more uncertain of their future salary than they had been 12 months earlier.

The report said that incomes had fallen and the outlook for was relatively uncertain.

Half of those surveyed admitted to taking steps such as increasing their hours or looking for a new job to help them cope with the financial squeeze.

This would explain why, despite falling employment levels, the total number of workforce jobs has increased by 150,000.

Crunched: The economy has yet to be revitalised by low interest rates, with more than 15 per cent put off spending by concerns over credit

Many put the problems down to Government austerity measures, and their outlook for the future was gloomy as well, with more than two-thirds expecting more pain to come.

The report added: 'Some households reported that the fiscal consolidation was affecting them, mainly through lower income and higher taxes, and that they were responding, particularly by trying to increase their labour supply through finding a new job or working longer hours.'

With confidence at a low and money tight, consumer demand is also falling - leading to fears of another recession.

Interest rates remain at a low of 0.5 per cent, but Britain is on a knife-edge, with home-owners on variable interest rate mortgages admitting they would struggle if these rose by even one percentage point.

Renters were worst affected, with an average disposable income of £450 per month, where the average across all households was £720.

Trying times: Bill-payers are finding it tough to keep up with their commitments

The average pre-tax income per household was just over £2,850.

The Bank of England said credit conditions 'remained tight' and as many as a tenth of respondents said they had been forced to turn to family and friends to borrow money.

It said: 'Over the past year, the recovery in the 
UK economy appears to have slowed. That weakness in the UK demand has 
been driven by falling consumption, reflecting the challenging 
environment facing households.

'Some households were finding that they could not save as much due to lower income or the higher cost of essentials,' added the report.

The number of households who saved nothing at all had increased from last year to two-fifths, and 14 per cent said they had dipped in to savings and other assets to help keep up with bills and repayments.

The average amount of money saved was just £176 per month.
