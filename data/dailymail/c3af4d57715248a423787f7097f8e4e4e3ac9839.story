A bride called off her wedding in China when a boat sent to collect her sank en-route with the loss of six lives.

The tragedy happened on a river near the township of Sanyanggang in Hunan province in the south of China.

The bride was wearing her dress and clutching a bouquet of flowers whilst she waited with her bridesmaids for the boat to arrive to take her to the wedding.

Tragic: The bodies are brought ashore on a boat

Grief: The wedding party and locals were left in shock by the accident

But a savage storm blew up on the water. The bride heard the distant beating of drums - a traditional pre-wedding ritual - aboard the vessel, but suddenly there was silence.

A police spokesman said: ‘The boat had 10 people aboard, the maximum number allowed.

‘They were pitched into the water and forced to swim for their lives to the riverbank.  But sadly three people didn't make it and were lost.’

Fearful: The bride was left too distraught to go ahead with her big day and thought it was an unlucky omen

Extreme weather: The accident happened after a ferocious storm moved in

Search: Officials are still looking for three other bodies

Three bodies were recovered but three are still missing. Police say there is little hope of them being found alive.

‘The bride was waiting and waiting, but the people didnít come. When she heard the news, she almost broke down,’ said one guest.

‘What should have been a happy day turned into a nightmare.’

‘The bride was left too distraught to go ahead with her big day and thought it was an unlucky omen. Instead of celebrating a wedding, a funeral was held for the three people who were recovered as the local town went into mourning.’

The search for the other three bodies continues.
