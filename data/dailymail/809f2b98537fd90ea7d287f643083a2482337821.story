Darren Wilson has officially resigned from Ferguson police following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

His decision to quit the force comes five days after a grand jury chose not to indict him for the killing of the 18-year-old in the Missouri city. 

The 28-year-old has been on administrative leave since August 9 following the incident and hopes the community will now be able to 'heal' as a result of his departure. 

Wilson's attorney Neil Bruntrager announced that he would be stepping down and his resignation would be effective immediately.

Darren Wilson has officially resigned from Ferguson police following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown

His resignation letter states that his decision was based on his own 'free will' and claimed part of the reason was because he was a 'risk' to his colleagues and Missouri residents 

He told the St. Louis Dispatch that he was resigning because of his 'own free will' and didn't want to put his colleagues at risk by staying. 

Wilson said stepping down is the 'hardest thing I've ever had to do' and said being a cop is the only thing he ever wanted to do.

In his resignation letter, the recently-married Wilson said his presence put the residents and officers of Ferguson at risk.  He now hopes the community will be able to 'heal' following weeks of violence and protests.

In an interview with CNN last week, Bruntager said he told Wilson it would be too dangerous for him to go back to his job, saying that his first job would lead him to a back alley where he would be 'executed'.  

The Justice Department continues to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot  Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.

The news of Wilson's resignation didn't seem to appease a small group of protesters who stood outside of the Ferguson police department on Saturday night.

'I've been protesting out here since August,' said Rick Campbell, who added that he didn't care that Wilson had resigned.

Several other protesters who were asked to comment shrugged their shoulders or expressed disinterest. 

During an interview with ABC earlier this week, Wilson said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into Brown's death would clear him, just as a grand jury did

'We were not after Wilson's job,' civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement to AP. 'We were after Michael Brown's justice.'

During his interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Wilson insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career.

However Wilson has said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into the shooting will find 'nothing' and clear him just as a Missouri grand jury did earlier this week.

Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding, that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the St. Louis County, and will remain so.

'While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,' Attorney General Eric Holder , 63, said. 

'In addition, the Department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.'

Wilson, speaking to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday, admitted that he's worried about there being a federal criminal investigation, but is confident investigators will find 'nothing' to suggest he broke the law.

'I stand by what I did,' he said. 'I stand by my training, and just have to wait and see what they determine.'

Stephanopoulos asked Wilson: 'You're confident that no charges will be brought?'

Wilson responded, 'Yeah.' 

I, Darren Wilson, hereby resign my commission as a police officer with the City of Ferguson effective immediately. 

I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. 

For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. 

It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal. 

I would like to thank all of my supporters and fellow officers throughout this process.

The decision not to indict Wilson on criminal charges following the shooting drew mass demonstrations in Ferguson - some violent - that have continued through Black Friday 

Demonstrators have been staging 'die-in's across the country, disrupting the holiday sales 

Mail Online revealed earlier this week that Wilson could have a $1million 'war chest' from donation funds set up by his supporters. 

A woman who founded the movement, who chose not to be named, said she had been subject to a torrent or 'vile' online abuse. 

He has not incurred huge legal fees as his lawyers were all from the police force union and the force is likely to have covered the cost of hiding him until the grand jury verdict was announced. 

There had been reports that he had been paid up to six figures for the ABC News interview. Wilson however strenuously denied the claim suggesting: 'I wouldn't jeopardize me integrity for dollar.'  

Wilson got married on October 24 to 37-year-old Barbara Spalding during a ceremony in Overland, Missouri. He also revealed that he is going to be a father for the first time and just wants a 'normal life' for his family.  

Wilson began his career in nearby Jennings before moving to the Ferguson job a few years ago. He had no previous complaints against him and a good career record, according to Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who called Wilson 'an excellent police officer.'

A few months before the shooting, Wilson had received a commendation for detaining a suspect in a drug case.
