A teenage passenger who was in a car when a 17-year-old girl was shot and killed by Denver police has disputed authorities' account of her death, saying officers opened fire before one of them was struck by the vehicle.

The passenger, speaking late Tuesday to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said her friend, Jessica Hernandez, lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot.

Police have said the Monday morning shooting in a residential alley came after Hernandez drove a stolen vehicle into one of them.

Prosecutors on Tuesday promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a small group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death.

The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.

It was also the fourth time in seven months that a Denver police officer fired into a moving vehicle after perceiving it as a threat, and the city's independent police monitor now says he will investigate the department's policies and practices related to shooting at moving vehicles, which he said poses unique safety risks.

Police spokesman Sonny Jackson offered no new details about the case on Tuesday, citing the department's open investigation.

The shooting happened after an officer was called to check on a suspicious vehicle, Chief Robert White has said. A colleague arrived after the officer determined the car had been reported stolen. Police have said the two officers approached the car on foot when Hernandez drove into one of them, and they both then opened fire.

The car's passenger said police had surrounded the car in the alley, and Hernandez was trying to flee, attempting to drive around one of the squad cars.

The officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside, the passenger said.

Hernandez wrecked the car into a fence after she was shot, according to the witness. Police said the officer suffered a leg injury for which he was treated at a hospital and released.

Officers with their guns drawn then pulled people out of the car, including Hernandez, who they handcuffed and searched.

The passenger was unaware the vehicle was stolen and provided only vague details about what the group of teenagers was doing earlier in the night. 

Both officers involved in the shooting have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation.

'We're angry about it. It's another life taken by another cop,' said 19-year-old Cynthia Valdez, a close friend and schoolmate of the girl. 'She was trying to find her talent. She wanted to find out what she wanted to be. ... Who knows what she could have been?'

Few details were immediately released after the shooting in an alley in the older, middle-class residential neighborhood. The four other people - three girls and a boy - in the car were not injured by the gunfire, and all were being questioned as part of the investigation, police said.

It was not clear whether any had been arrested.

Police Chief Robert White said an officer was called to check on a suspicious vehicle at around 6.30am Monday in the Park Hill section of Denver and a colleague arrived after it was determined the car had been reported stolen.

In a statement, police said the two officers then 'approached the vehicle on foot when the driver drove the car into one of the officers.'

White said both officers then opened fire. The officer hit by the car was taken to a hospital with a leg injury.

Bobbie Diaz, whose 17-year-old daughter was in the car, said she was lying in bed when she heard four gunshots followed by an officer yelling, 'Freeze! Get out of the car! Get down!'

Diaz said she came outside to see officers with their guns drawn pulling people out of the car, including Jessica.

'She seemed like she was not responding, not moving,' she said. 'They just yanked her out and handcuffed her.'

Meanwhile, Diaz said she heard another person screaming, 'She's dead! She's dead!'

'I'm just trying to process everything. I'm just heartbroken for the girl's family,' Diaz said. 'How could something like this happen again?'

Another woman, Arellia Hammock, who has lived in the neighborhood for about a decade, said she heard three gunshots about 6.30am and then saw several police cars streaming down the street.

Hammock said she understands one of the officers was injured, but 'that's still no reason to shoot.'

'They shouldn't have stolen a car. But the cops are too fast on the gun,' she said. 'You've got stun guns. You've got rubber bullets. Why do they have to shoot all the time?'

That sentiment was echoed during the vigil for Hernandez as some held signs decrying police brutality.

One of the signs read, 'Girls' Lives Matter,' a play on the 'Black Lives Matter' slogan that became a rallying cry after the police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City.

'It should have been handled differently. She's a young girl. I'm just not OK with it,' said 17-year-old Destiny Moya, who grew up with Jessica.

Prosecutors promised a thorough investigation  and asked angry protesters gathered outside District Attorney Mitch Morrissey's office for patience.

Morrissey wasn't there during the tense confrontation at his office, where chief deputy district attorneys Doug Jackson and Lamar Sims spoke over shouts and obscenities from some of the protesters.

Jackson said he could not discuss the facts of the case but assured the group that the findings of the investigation will be made public when it's finished.

'You can decide whether we made the right decision or not,' Jackson said.

The girl's cousin, Jose Castaneda, said he was frustrated and didn't want to wait months to find out what happened.

'Let me ask you one question, how would you feel if it was your kid?' he yelled before storming away.

Protesters said they don't trust Morrissey's office to handle the case because the last time a Denver police officer faced charges in a shooting was 1992.

'We are sick and tired of these kinds of things happening and there seems to be no true objective investigation,' said the Rev. Patrick Demmer of the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance.

A shrine of red and white flowers and candles, and a grinning white teddy bear marked the shooting scene Tuesday.

Magaly Castaneda, 17, a friend of Hernandez, visited the site and said she doubted Hernandez would have intentionally hit an officer.

'She didn't even get time to think that she was going to get shot,' Castaneda said.

She had known Hernandez since both were middle school students doing each other's hair and makeup. Castaneda said Hernandez would bring home friends who had nowhere else to go, sometimes exasperating her mother.

'She always had a heart. She always cared about everyone,' Castaneda said.

By law, police are allowed to use force to stop and overcome the resistance of another person. They can use it to match the force and overcome it.
