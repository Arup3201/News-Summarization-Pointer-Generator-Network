Around 300,000 people in Britain have homes worth £1million or more, a report revealed yesterday.

The number of ‘property millionaires’ has ballooned by almost 50,000 over the past year, fuelled by sharp rises in house prices in London and the South East.

While house prices are falling in most regions, particularly the North, around 100 property millionaires were created every day in the capital in 2012.

Exclusive: Property millionaires are going through the roof and London's exclusive Kensington district has the most, including these in the expensive Victoria Road

Grand: The £30m flat in W8 has five bedrooms and is in a postcode where two out of three homes are worth more than £1million

And in Wales... £2.5m could buy you this five-bed detached house on the celebrated Gower peninsula near Swansea

Property website Zoopla.co.uk said 
there were now 300,142 homes which are valued at £1million or more – the
largest number since it started monitoring the numbers five years ago.

Many homeowners bought their property 
for a fraction of the current value decades ago and now discover to 
their delight it is worth a seven-figure sum.

But many others are not so lucky. 
Their home may be worth more than £1million, but they have a super-size 
mortgage which means they have little equity in the property.

To qualify as a property millionaire, 
your home must be worth more than £1million, but it does not matter 
whether or not you have a mortgage.

The research highlights the gap between the value of homes in different parts of the country

The majority of ‘property 
millionaires’ live in London – nearly two-thirds are in the capital. The
South East is the next big winner, with around 62,000.

By comparison, there are just 844 in the whole of Wales.

A spokesman for Zoopla.co.uk, whose 
shareholders include A&N Media, a division of the Daily Mail and 
General Trust, said the research highlights the gulf between the value 
of homes in different parts of the country.

He said: ‘Wealthier buyers are 
relatively impervious to the economic problems affecting the rest of the
market – most notably, when it comes to getting a mortgage. Foreign 
buyers, in particular, have gravitated towards top-end property in 
London over the past few years, which has pushed up demand and prices.’

The research comes as millions are struggling to pay the mortgage on their home. Around a million people are using a payday loan to help to pay their monthly repayments, a report by the housing charity Shelter warns today.

At the other end of the spectrum, 
around 7.2million families do not have a mortgage and own their home 
outright, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Over the last two years, the average 
price of a home has remained at £162,000 despite monthly fluctuations. 
By comparison, the average full-time salary is £26,000.

Many potential homebuyers are 
standing ‘on the sidelines’ because they are too worried about the 
future to buy a property, the Nationwide said yesterday. It warned the 
housing market remains ‘fragile’ with many too nervous about job 
security and a possible triple-dip recession to take the plunge.
