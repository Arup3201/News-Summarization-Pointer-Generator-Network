This is the adorable moment three fluffy owlets spotted a photographer taking their picture - and tried to get a closer look.

Graham McGeorge had been visiting Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia for two months hoping to spot the young birds.

And one day after the trio's parents headed out to try and catch food they heard him shuffling around nearby.

Don't sc-owl, he's taking our picture... Photographer Graham McGeorge had been visiting Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia for two months hoping to spot the young birds

Move over, owl be the one he wants to see: One at a time the Eastern Screech owlets inched towards the edge of their nest, poking their heads out as Mr McGeorge busily snapped away.

What a hoot! There's a photographer outside! Mr McGeorge's patience was rewarded after National Geographic featured the incredibly rare moment in their 2013 photo contest - of which the winner is yet to be announced

One at a time the Eastern Screech owlets inched towards the edge of their nest, poking their heads out as Graham busily snapped away.

His patience was rewarded after National Geographic featured the incredibly rare moment in their 2013 photo contest - of which the winner is yet to be announced.

Mr McGeorge, who is originally from Scotland but is now living in Jacksonville, Florida, said: 'It takes just over an hour to get to the swamp and I spent two months there on weekends and travelling up after work.

'It's extremely rare to see them because they nest within the trunk and any crevice in the tree is usually made by woodpeckers.

'The adults are eight to ten inches tall and the owlets much smaller so unless you know where the nest is you won't see them.

'They are so elusive they hunt at night so you have to be pretty fortunate to be able to photograph them.

'Usually people won't see them until they go to start flying but both parents were away from nest so when they heard me they got really inquisitive.

'I happily waited for a long time watching them poke their heads out every 30 or 40 minutes intervals. It was fascinating behaviour to be able to witness.'

The entry period for National Geographic's 2013 photo competition ends on November 30. The winning photographs in each of three categories will be published in the magazine.
