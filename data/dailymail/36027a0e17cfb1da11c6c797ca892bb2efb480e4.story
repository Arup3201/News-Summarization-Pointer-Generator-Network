Candace Bushnell's New York apartment is now available to rent for $8,000 a month.

The Sex and the City creator  attempted to sell the two-bedroom co-op in September for $2.8million, after she divorced her ballet dancing husband of nine years, Charles Askegard.

According to the listing held by Ann Weintraub, main features of the Greenwich Village rental include a wood burning fireplace, floor-to-ceiling windows, inlaid wood flooring, and a marble-topped kitchen.

Tempting offer? Candace Bushnell's Greenwich Village apartment is now available to rent, for $8,000 a month, after she tried to sell int in September for $2.8million

Ms Bushnell's apartment, a labour of love which was featured on the cover of Elle Decor in
September 2005, was transformed from a 1920's 'wreck' when she 
moved in with  Mr Askegard, to a glossy Plaza look-a-like, marble-filled home.

The 53-year-old told Elle Decor: 'I'm the kind of 
person who would have liked to have lived at the Plaza. I love crystal 
chandeliers and gold leaf, velvets and mirrors, Oriental rugs and 
marble.

Careful characteristics: The co-op boasts southern views and light and two bedrooms - the second bedroom is currently being used as a dining room

Transformed: The kitchen and bathrooms were re-sized and re-done with marble and stone, and new closets were outfitted aroud the entire apartment

'I love things that are old and glittery, that come with layers 
of glamour and past lives. So the moment my husband and I walked into 
our apartment for the first time, we knew that this
was it.'

Located on East 9th St, the high floor apartment sits in a
pre-war, 1925 doorman building.

It boasts beautiful southern
views and light, two bedrooms (while the
second bedroom is currently being used as a dining room), one and one-half bathrooms, floor-to-ceiling windows, inlaid wood 
flooring, a dramatic sunken living room, and a working wood burning 
fireplace.

A former model turned interior 
designer, Susan Forristal, whose tastes range from 'classical to 
contemporary,' directed Ms Bushnell on the apartment's transformation.

The kitchen and bathrooms were 
re-sized and re-done with marble and stone, and new closets were 
outfitted aroud the entire apartment.

According to Ms Bushnell, back in the Twenties the building was considered to have every modern convenience.

She said: 'There were servants’ 
quarters on the top floor, and, in the basement, extensive kitchens from
which young men could order dinner which was sent up in a dumbwaiter.

'It was all very Jeeves & Wooster, reeking of late-night parties and 
illicit affairs, bathtub gin and jazz.'

Ms Bushnell, who created the iconic character Carrie Bradshaw, found fame after her Sex And The City column was turned into a book and then adapted into the hit TV series which also spawned two films.

She
is now set for further success, following a TV adaptation of the 
prequel to Sex and the City, the Carrie Diaries, which will premiere on 
January 14 on the CW network.

Roaring 20's to modern day: According to Ms Bushnell, the apartment reeked of late-night parties and 
illicit affairs, bathtub gin and jazz from the Twenties; their renovation,she said, kept a bit of that glamour

The book tells the tale of 16-year-old Carrie Bradshaw and her life with her family in Connecticut in the 1980s, before an internship with a Manhattan law firm sparks her love affair with New York.

Thought to be the epitome of New York single life, Ms Bushnell married Mr Askegard in 2002, to which her ex-boyfriend Stephen Morris said it was 'Lose-your-independence day' for the writer.

Their marriage broke down after Mr Askegard allegedly had an affair with a Nutcracker co-star 'half her age'.
