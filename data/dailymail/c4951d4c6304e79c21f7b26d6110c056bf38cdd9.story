An exclusive new 220mph supercar named after a legendary and lethal fighting bull is to roar into life  with a £3million price tag.

But only three of the new Lamborghini Venenos - described as a 'street legal racing car' - will be built and sold; and they already have buyers.

The £9million trio have been built specially to celebrate the Italian supercar firm’s 50th anniversary and each will carry a different colour from Italy’s national flag – green, white and red.

Sueprcar: The exclusive new 220mph Lamborghini Veneno, which has a £3million price tag

Speed: The car is expected to be able to accelerate from rest to 60mph in under 3 seconds

The two-seater Veneno is powered by a massive 6.5 litre 12 cylinder petrol engine developing 750 horse-power – equivalent to seven Ford Fiestas – linked to a seven speed manual gear-box with five different driving modes and permanent all-wheel drive, which Lamborghini says delivers ‘a thrilling combination of absolute high-revving frenzy and phenomenal pulling power’.

It is expected to accelerate from rest to 60mph in under 3 seconds.

Lamborghini described the ‘extremely exclusive’ Veneno as ‘a racing prototype and road-going super sports car’ based on the Lamborghini Aventador.

It was unveiled on the eve of the Geneva Motor show in Switzerland at a special evening event hosted by the parent Volkswagen Group at which Britain’s Bentley also showcased its new Flying Spur.

The supercar firm said: 'Only three unique units of the Lamborghini Veneno will be built and sold.

'Its design is consistently focused on optimum aerodynamics, giving the Veneno the look of a racing prototype, yet it holds a regular road license.'

Lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre materials form the single cell or monocoque chassis as well as the outer skin of the ‘extreme sports car’ with an aluminium sub-frame and ‘scissor doors’ which open up and out.

A spokesman for Lamborghini said: 'Fully in keeping with the tradition of the brand, the name of the Veneno originates from a legendary fighting bull.

'Veneno is the name of one of the strongest and most aggressive fighting bulls ever. He is also famous to be one of the fastest bulls in the history of bullfight. His name became popular in 1914, when he gored do death José Sánchez Rodríguez during the bullfight in the arena Sanlúcar de Barrameda's.'

The aerodynamically sculpted supercar 
has razor-sharp lines, an arrow-shaped front, a smooth underbody, four 
sizable exhaust end pipes divided by a splitter, a large central fin and
an adjustable rear wing.

Racing prototype: Lamborghini has described the 'extremely exclusive' Veneno as 'a racing prototype and road-going super sports car' based on the Lamborghini Aventador

To boost aerodynamic flow, the side line of the Veneno is therefore dominated by enormous sills and mighty wheel arches front and rear.

A spokesman said: 'The Lamborghini Veneno brings the aerodynamic efficiency of a racing prototype to the road. Every detail of its form pursues a clear function – exceptional dynamics, optimum downforce with minimal drag and perfect cooling of the high-performance engine.

'The entire front end of the Lamborghini Veneno has been laid out for perfect airflow and downforce. The front end works as a large aerodynamic wing.'

It has 20 inch alloy wheels at the front
and 21 inches at the rear. A carbon-fibre ring around the wheel rim 
works like a turbine to deliver additional cooling air to the powerful 
carbon-ceramic brake discs as they get hot.

Rare: The fourth car, called 'number 0' and created as a test vehicle for the other three, is the only one being shown at Geneva

The Veneno is painted in an all-new, grey metallic-look colour with individual parts highlighed in black in the exposed and visible carbon-fibre structure.

The three cars sold to customers compose a trilogy in green, white and red accents, each of one featuring a single color of the Italian national flag, thus representing a unique piece: ‘The trilogy of three unique vehicles will be produced in the course of the year 2013 and handed over to their future owners.’

A fourth car called 'number 0' and created as a test vehicle for the other three is the only one being shown at Geneva and will also be the only Veneno displaying all three colours of the Italian flag.Lamborghini said: 'Its future has not been determined yet, but it will allow Lamborghini to continue its activity of testing and innovation, both on the road and on the race track.'

All exterior parts are made from carbon fibre which also dominates the interior with an exposed central tunnel and sills.

Two lightweight bucket seats are made from Lamborghini’s patented composite. A specially woven carbon-fibre skin is used to clad the entire cockpit, part of the seats and the headliner.

A spokesman said: 'This unique material is soaked in a very special kind of resin that stabilizes the fibre structure, while allowing the material to remain supple. Like a hi-tech fabric, this extremely fine-looking carbon-fibre matting fits perfectly to any form. And it reduces weight.'
