The larger-than-life family that features on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was apparently given a huge raise after the second episode aired.

Matriarch June Shannon and her brood had been due to get between $5,00 and $7,000 an episode, however that figure was boosted to between $15,000 and $20,000 once TLC realised how popular the show was, reports today claim.

And it seems the family did not even expect or demand the pay increase.

Cashing in? The family behind Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was apparently given a huge raise by TLC, to around $15,000-$20,000 an episode

According to TMZ,  'network honchos approached the family and 
told them they were boosting their salary.'

It added that TLC also offered to cover a number of additional expenses for the family, including a driver and bodyguard figure for Ms Shannon's partner Sugar Bear who was hospitalized recently after a 'mud-boggin' crash.

The site also reports that the network wanted to help the clan relocate to a larger and more secure home, but Ms Shannon declined the offer as she likes to decorate the property over the holidays for the local community.

Ms Shannon has also refused to sign with an agent, despite numerous offers, TMZ says, for fear that a publicity schedule would keep her away from Sugar Bear and her girls.

The subject of the Shannon-Thompson family's salaries came to light last month, when The Hollywood Reporter claimed the family were being paid just $2,000 an episode - a small figure compared with how much TLC would profit from their antics.

Ms Shannon scoffed at the suggestion, however, insisting to TMZ that the family is paid 'a good deal more'.

She refused to divulge the exact amount TLC are giving - vaguely adding 'we're making memories to last a lifetime'.

TV gold: The star of the show is seven-year-old Alana. Her appearance on Toddlers & Tiaras inspired TLC bosses to give her a spin-off series

However other reality TV stars such as NeNe Leakes of Atlanta Housewives and Jersey
Shore's Snooki are known to score six-figure salaries for their on-screen exploits.

TLC offered seven-year-old beauty queen Alana Thompson, aka Honey Boo Boo and her self-proclaimed redneck family their own spin-off series this year after she appeared on Toddlers & Tiaras.

She and her mother sparked concern and outrage from viewers after it emerged that she was drinking caffeinated soft drinks to give her energy before pageants.

The debut season of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo enjoyed an average of 2.4 million viewers er episode.

In response to the showâ€™s success, TLC 
has ordered three HOLLAday specials (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas)
and additional episodes of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has become a 
pop culture phenomenon,' said Amy Winter, general manager of TLC.

'What 
you see is what you get and we are excited to share even more of Alana 
and her family's unbridled hilarity, sincerity and love with our 
viewers.'
