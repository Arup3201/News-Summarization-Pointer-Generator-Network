Ellen DeGeners has hit back at a Christian pastor who accused her of 'promoting a gay agenda' via her immensely popular talk show.

In an article for the Christian Post, contributor Larry Tomczak called out programmes he believes are causing a 'tidal wave of unprecedented evil' to sweep America, including Ellen's show.

But now she has responded in true comedic style, saying she is 'not trying to brainwash anyone', before adding that Mr Tomczak is obviously 'watching a lot of gay TV'. 

Ellen DeGeneres' show was singled out by pastor Larry Tomczak who accused her of 'celebrating her lesbianism and "marriage" in between appearances of guests like Taylor Swift to attract young girls'

Mr Tomczak singled out Ellen for criticism in an opinion piece he posted online called  'Are You Aware of the Avalanche of Gay Programming Assaulting Your Home?'.

As well as targeting her show, he also accused new movie Foxcatcher, talent show American Idol, and sitcom Two And A Half Men of being part of Hollywood's gay agenda.

He attacks Dallas Cowboys defensive end Michael Sam for coming out as gay, calling him a 'castaway', and bashes gay advocacy groups for trying to push the gay agenda on children. 

But the comedian, 56 (pictured with wife Portia de Rossi), hit back saying she wasn't "married" with inverted commas, but was simply 'married, that's it'

Speaking about Ellen specifically, he writes that she 'celebrates her lesbianism and "marriage" in between appearances of guests like Taylor Swift to attract young girls.'

As a remedy he suggests parents need to monitor what their children are watching, point out 'unseemly characters' to kids, and show them 'wholesome' shows instead, such as 'Gunsmoke, Little House on the Prairie and I Love Lucy'.

After being pointed to the article, 56-year-old comedian Ellen took five minutes at the end of her last show to address his claims directly.

Ellen, who wed Australian Portia de Rossi in 2008, said: 'In the article, the pastor criticises a lot of TV shows for promoting gay agendas. 

'He says that Glee has over five [gay] characters. Modern Family had a gay wedding. Anderson Cooper boasts about his homosexuality. If you ask me, Larry is watching a lot of gay TV.'

Moving on to his specific allegations about her show, she added: 'First of all, I’m not "married"' she said, using finger-quotes 'I’m married, that's it.'

'And, Larry, I don’t even know what it means to celebrate my lesbianism. Well, I guess I do,' she added, pulling a party-popper. 'Yay! I'm gay.'

On a more serious note, she said: 'The only way I’m trying to influence people is to be more kind and compassionate with one another. 

'That is the message I’m sending out. I don’t have an agenda. I’m not here to brainwash anyone.'

From the wings an assistant then handed her a black and white hypnosis wheel which she began twirling at the camera, before launching in to one last joke.

'Attention youth of the world: I want you to live your lives being exactly who you are. Be true to yourself — the most important thing is to be true to yourself. 

'The second most important thing is that you wear Ellen underwear and only Ellen underwear.'

After Mr Tomczak also criticised a host of other shows for featuring gay people or characters, Ellen (pictured centre at the Oscars last year) accused him of 'watching a lot of gay TV'
