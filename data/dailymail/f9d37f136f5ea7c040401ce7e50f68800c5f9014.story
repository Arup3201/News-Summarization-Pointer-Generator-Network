Downturn: Business leaders and economists last night called for interest rates to be slashed to zero - amid warnings that Britain could face an unprecedented 'triple-dip' recession. This has piled further pressure on George Osborne, pictured

Business leaders and economists last night called for interest rates to be slashed to zero – amid warnings that Britain could face an unprecedented ‘triple-dip’ recession.

The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) urged the Bank of England to take immediate action to slash the cost of borrowing to homeowners and business, following shock growth figures last week showing the economic downturn is accelerating.

Economists at the Ernst & Young Item Club also backed the call, saying an interest rate cut was ‘not the only answer, but it would help’.

The two organisations are the only forecasters to use the same economic model as the Treasury, meaning their conclusions are based on identical data to that used by Chancellor George Osborne.

Their intervention comes amid warnings that Britain could suffer an extraordinary triple-dip recession unless urgent action is taken to boost growth.

Official figures last week showed Britain’s economy shrank by 0.7 per cent between April and June. Most analysts believe the Olympics effect will pull Britain out of recession later this year.

But, with the eurozone crisis unresolved, there are growing fears of a fresh downturn next year – turning the current double-dip recession into a triple-dip.

Azad Zangana, an analyst at Schroders, said Britain would enjoy an economic bounce until next spring, but would then slump back into recession unless action was taken to resolve the eurozone crisis.

Michael Saunders, at Citigroup, said the outlook was ‘disastrously bad compared with previous [economic] cycles’.

The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee is already under pressure to cut interest rates from their historic low of 0.5 per cent. Some commentators believe a cut to 0.25 per cent could be agreed this week, but others want the Bank to go further and slash rates to zero.

Action on this scale would knock 
almost £500 a year off a typical £150,000 tracker mortgage – putting 
money directly into the hands of cash-strapped families. It could also 
help businesses struggling to pay their debts.

But
it would be bad news for savers, pensioners and those approaching 
retirement, who are already suffering the effects of years of low 
interest rates.

David Kern,
chief economist at the BCC, said a rate cut would be more effective in 
boosting demand and easing inflation than another round of the 
quantitative easing recently favoured by the Bank.

‘A rate cut now could really help business,’ he said. ‘Lower inflation is critical to underpinning real incomes and sustaining demand in the UK economy.’

But former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont warned that existing low rates were already distorting the markets and having a dramatic effect on pensioners.

Mr Osborne received a rare boost at the weekend when the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s confirmed Britain’s coveted Triple-A credit rating, which allows the Government to borrow at rock-bottom rates to service the debts left by Labour.

The Chancellor said the verdict showed the Government was on the right track. He added: ‘This is a reminder that despite the economic problems we face, the world has confidence that we are dealing with them.’

But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘The long-term impact on the underlying strength of the British economy will be more young people unemployed and businesses investing in other parts of the world.

'All those things add up to an economy which ends up permanently weaker, not just temporarily weaker.’
