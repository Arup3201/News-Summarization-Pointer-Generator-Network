A New Hampshire man was arrested on Thursday after authorities say he robbed four banks in Midtown Manhattan and then tried to evade authorities by going through the Lincoln Tunnel - on foot.

Maverick Madore, 20, is suspected of robbing five banks in New Hampshire before his alleged New York City robbery spree. His accomplice in the robberies, Frank Mione, managed to evade police and is still on the loose.

The NYPD says Madore kicked things off about 3 p.m. Thursday when he walked into a Bank of America on Broadway near W. 34th Street and pretended to be holding a gun in his pocket.

Madore demanded cash from the teller, who handed over an undisclosed amount.

Madore then moved uptown, where he robbed three more banks, including a Capital One on Broadway and W. 56th Street - which proved to be the beginning of the end of his alleged crime spree.

Along with some cash, the teller at the Capital One handed Madore a dye pack that exploded when he passed a sensor in the banks entrance way.

After the pack exploded, Madore ditched the ink-covered sweatshirt he was wearing as he jumped into his getaway car, presumably driven by Mione.

Police hot on their trail, the pair's getaway car crashed on W. 31st street near the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Rather than give himself up, Madore tried to ditch police by running through the tunnel towards New Jersey.

Considering his escape plan included running through a tunnel that has only one way in and one way out - and he was on foot - it didn't take long for authorities to take him into custody.

This isn't Madore's first scrape with the law, according to court records obtained by Mail Online, he's previously been arrested for operating a vehicle without a license, reckless operation and multiple counts of criminal mischief (vandalism).

Additionally, he has been arrested on multiple assault charges, and obstructing the report of a crime or injury.

Charges for the alleged bank robberies currently are pending.
