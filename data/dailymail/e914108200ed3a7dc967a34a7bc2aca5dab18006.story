A man who says he found a piece of 'space junk' from a Russian rocket that re-entered the atmosphere over Australia last week has tried to sell it online for $100,000.

An advertisement for the globe-shaped object found on Sunday near Walgett in north-west NSW was posted on Gumtree by a man only known as Peter.

The 13.4kg object was believed to be a fuel cell from a Russian rocket and was 40cm in diameter and made of titanium, according to the seller.

Peter posted a photo of himself holding the globe-shaped object found on Sunday near Walgett in northern NSW on Gumtree for $100,000  

In the advertisement, which has since been removed from Gumtree, Peter said the space junk was found on the Castlereagh Highway, under the Pagan Creek bridge.

A fireball spotted travelling over Australia last Thursday at 9.45pm was the third stage of the Soyuz rocket, which was launched from Kazakhstan on July 8.

It plummeted to Earth at speeds of 29,000km/h.  

'One of the valves is completely burnt off and has left some spectacular flow lines of melting titanium as it re-entered earth's atmosphere,' the Gumtree advertisement read.

'The second valve is still partially intact.'

Peter believes the space junk is a fuel cell from a Russian rocket that re-entered the atmosphere over Australia last week

Professor of Planetary Science at Western Australia's Curtin University, Phil Bland, is one of several Australian researchers currently tracking the rocket's flight path. 

He told the ABC the item Peter was selling on Gumtree certainly looked like space debris, but doubted it was from the Russian rocket seen over Australia last week.

'You may get things scattered a little bit - say plus or minus a few kilometres - but there is no way it can move so far,' he said.

Prof Bland said where the item was discovered was hundreds of kilometres east of the path of the re-entry.
