Tennis fan Pippa Middleton is used to being the centre of attention when it comes to celebrity spotting at ball games.

But today the Duchess of Cambridge's sister was upstaged by a real tennis superstar, as Maria Sharapova cheered from the crowd just inches away from her at the Queen's Club in London.

Fresh from celebrating her French Open win at Roland Garros on Saturday the Russian ace was in London to see Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov play Great Britain's James Ward during the Men's Singles match on day two of the Aegon Championships at the Queens Club in West Kensington.

Maria, 6.2", arrived after Pippa, and was seated just a few rows behind the author.

While the Russian player, 27, was dressed casually in light blue jeans, a slogan T-shirt and a loose, striped jacket, Pippa had opted for a more ladylike look, showing off her recently cut 'lob' (long
 bob) hairstyle, which she wore in loose curls.

Pippa, 30, also wore a Tory Burch white dress with intricate blue and green floral details, which she accessorised with a CH Carolina Herrera Minueto bag and oversized sunglasses.

Just like thrifty sister Kate, Pippa has worn the dress before. She wore it last year in a summer themed photoshoot for Waitrose magazine.

On the brand's website, the dress' description reads: 'Just in time for summer, the Talley Dress is an effortless, work-to-weekend style made in soft stretch poplin with a tailored look.

Both women wore dark black sunglasses but their spectactor style is generally quite different with Pippa choosing a ladylike Tory Burch dress and Maria dressing down in ripped jeans and a T-shirt

'The sleeveless silhouette has a straight fit on top, a figure-defining banded waist and a full, flared skirt that is universally flattering. Wear it with pumps or sandals for easy warm-weather chic.'

Pippa's shorter hairstyle is winning the seal of approval of top style experts.

Celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood, who works with Mariah Carey, Vanessa Hudgens and Louise Roe, was full of praise for the socialite's new look.

'I always think a good few inches chop
 makes hair look thicker and healthier,' she told MailOnline. 'Pippa's 
long locks were starting to look stringy so I like the new do! This cut gives more structure to her 
cheekbones which looked a lot rounder with lengthier locks and I'm 
loving the extra highlight she added to her make-up to accentuate them.'

Known as the pre-Wimbledon warm-up, the 2014 AEGON Championships at London's Queen's Club will see some prominent contenders, including Andy Murry, play.

Australian Open winner Stanislas Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lleyton Hewitt will also play.

The schedule is notoriously loose and the order of play is only ever agreed the night before.

Pippa was last seen out and about in London a month ago, along 
with brother James, 27, girlfriend Donna Air, and friend Tom Kingston, having dined out at Trishna 
restaurant in the capital after Pippa attended a party for supermarket 
Waitrose.

Pippa recently suffered a set-back after her column in The Telegraph was axed after just six months.

According to Us Weekly, a source at the paper said that
 readers 'just weren't into' her fortnightly Sports and Social pieces, 
which touched on various themes from boxing and rowing to shucking 
oysters and flipping pancakes.

'There was a lot of negative mail coming in after each column and there 
were too many off-limit subjects for her,' said the source. 'They ran out of ideas.'

Pippa's 
most recent piece for the Telegraph was published on March 29. It 
featured a recipe for a pasta dish, which she said was 'perfect for 
post-exercise recovery.'

In
 another article called 'Pippa: turning crÃªped crusader for Pancake 
Day,' she explored London to find which restaurants make the best 
pancakes for Shrove Tuesday.
