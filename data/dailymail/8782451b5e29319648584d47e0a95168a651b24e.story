Wayne Rooney had his designer luggage 'ransacked' by security after a nightmare start to his post-World Cup holiday with his wife Coleen.

The Rooneys flew with British Airways to Sin City on Saturday for a family holiday - but without their luggage which arrived two days late in Las Vegas from Heathrow.

Rooney was criticised for his performances in Brazil with England, despite scoring against Uruguay, and is now looking to cool off before returning for pre-season training under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United.

But the striker's holiday got off to a bumpy start as his luggage took two days to join him in the US.

Wife Coleen tweeted: 'Feel sick..... just received my 4 cases 2
 days late from BA Heathrow to Las Vegas.

'Opened them all and they have been completely ransacked.

'Bags shoes bikinis, clothes, toiletries, underwear, pj's, makeup, toiletries taken. Disgusting & the customer service getting is terrible.

She faced a 
string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could perhaps afford to replace the items.

However, 
she angrily replied that it is not about the money, tweeting: ‘And you 
can stick all the sarcastic comments about money. It’s not all about 
money it’s about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff
 that I need for my holiday’.

The couple are staying at the luxurious Encore Beach Club while the footballer enjoys a break before heading back to training with Manchester United.

It is set to be another big season for the striker as he starts work under new manager, Louis van Gaal.

British Airways told MailOnline: 'We are very sorry. We are contacting Mrs Rooney to apologise and have begun a full investigation.'

Coleen may have been the victim of an airport computer glitch that meant some air passengers have still not been reunited with their luggage days after a problem started.

The glitch began on Thursday at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 (T5) and has affected departing British Airways passengers.

Missing: Despite arriving with a large selection of suitcases, Coleen tweeted that not all of them made it

Angry: Coleen took to Twitter to complain about the state of her luggage

Some of these travellers had to fly without their hold luggage and although normal baggage check-in has resumed at T5, not all the affected passengers have got their bags yet.

T5 had a disastrous opening in March 2008 when thousands of bags went missing and there were long delays and cancellations.

A Heathrow spokeswoman said today: 'We experienced intermittent issues with the T5 baggage system between June 26 and 29 which caused some bags to be processed manually. Passengers can now check in bags as normal.

'Manual processing led to some bags not making flights in time. While passengers are receiving bags all the time, it will take several days to reunite all passengers with their bags.

'We are very sorry for the disruption passengers have experienced and we are working round the clock with airlines to reunite passengers with their bags as quickly as possible.'
