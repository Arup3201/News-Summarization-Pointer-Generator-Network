Per Mertesacker has delivered a defiant FA Cup final message, claiming Arsenal are ready to end nine years of disappointment and become winners again.

German centre-half Mertesacker believes victory against Hull City at Wembley can be the launch pad to glory for Arsene Wenger’s team.

‘It would be a big step,’ said Mertesacker. ‘We have been through a lot of difficulties. We were top of the league, then we dropped points and then came back to fourth position. We have won five consecutive games and we want to continue.

‘That is really important. It looks like we are back on track. We have to keep our focus. We think we can achieve something with this group. There is more belief. Eight players have extended their contracts and the manager is likely to do that as well. We are much stronger than when I came in.

‘The core is altogether and this has changed the belief, the togetherness and the confidence.’

Meanwhile, sources close to Lukasz Fabianski say the goalkeeper is confident of starting in the final. Fabianski has played in all of Arsenal’s FA Cup games so far.
