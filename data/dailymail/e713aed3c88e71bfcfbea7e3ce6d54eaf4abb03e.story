The terror attack on a Sydney cafe is well organised and designed for 'maximum publicity' and to create 'maximum impact' of terrorising Australians, a terrorism expert said.

Professor Jeff Lewis of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology said the armed man who has taken hostages inside the Lindt cafe had deliberately chosen iconic Martin Place and the cafe opposite the Seven Network office 'because it would get maximum publicity' and because it represented the spoils of Western society.

Martin Place is one of Sydney's most distinguished shopping precincts with upmarket restaurants, cafes and bars, high-end fashion boutiques and designer shops including Giorgio Armani.

Deliberately chosen: Martin Place was 'deliberately chosen' for the terror attack by Islamic extremists because it is iconic and represents what ISIS hates: Western wealth and capitalism

Maximum publicity: The terrorists chose a spot opposite Channel 7's Martin Place headquarters (above) to get maximum publicity to create terror and to attract followers 

Carefully selected: The Lindt Cafe (pictured, just after hostages were taken inside) was strategic for the terrorists because it was a 'soft' target without security and located across from a television studio

Universal emblem: Profess Jeff Lewis said the use of the Shahada flag (pictured) by the terrorist did not necssarily mean he was from Jabhat al-Nusra, as the flag had universal appeal to devout Muslims

'They have chosen a soft target, that is one that unlike the Sydney Opera House doesn't have security and therefore creates the maximum amount of fear,' Professor Lewis told Daily Mail Australia.

'Martin Place is iconic and represents what people in Islamic State (IS) detest in Western societies' because of its expensive shops, designer stores and other businesses surrounded by government offices and the big banks.

'We don't know yet who is behind this attack, but I wouldn't say it is necessarily Jabhat al-Nusra [the extremist Syrian-based group which uses the flag],' he said.

Well organised: The terror attack was well-organised for mass publicity and maximum fear by chosing a 'soft' target in Martin Place (pictured)

'The Shahada flag is a kind of universal flag. The writing "there is only one God" is supported by every day Muslims in their devotions, and so they could be IS supporters using this flag.'

Professor Lewis said IS had conducted a global promotion campaign over recent months to encourage people around the world 'to just act' and promote terror.

'They have been very active in trying to incite support the western world ,' he said.

'This attack could  be part of some network or co-ordinated plan.

'But it has been very well organised for maximum effect. Modern terrorism is about communication of its message, which is to terrorise its enemies but also to attract supporters.'

Professor Lewis said the attack was 'the most audacious act of modern terrorism associated with Islam'.

'We have yet to learn what their objectives are, but the longer it goes on the more publicity they gain and they are achieving their objectives.'

Professor Lewis is a professor of media and culture, specialising in terrorism.
