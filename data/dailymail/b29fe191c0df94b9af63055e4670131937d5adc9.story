He still lives alone, cooks for himself and enjoys an occasional drink.

And yesterday Britain’s oldest man Ralph Tarrant took centre stage at his 110th birthday party.

Despite reaching the milestone the great great grandfather shows no signs of slowing down, knocking back a glass or two of his favourite whisky.

‘I really don’t know what all the fuss is about, I’ve never really counted the years I’ve just got on with it,’ he said.

‘I don’t feel my age, certainly not 
in my head. I sometimes get a few aches and pains and I’ve been ill 
recently but I’m getting my strength back now. I’ll be happy as long as I
can get about under my own steam and I can do that quite well now.’

He and his wife Phyllis were the 
country’s longest married couple, wed for 79 years, until she died on 
New Year’s Day 2012 aged 102. Mr Tarrant said he has managed on his own 
‘with a bit of help’ and is fit enough to go shopping and cook his own 
meals.

The whole family turned out to celebrate the happy occasion with great great grandfather Ralph

Yesterday every generation of his family gathered at a hotel in Sheffield to toast Mr Tarrant.

Born in Nottingham on July 7, 1903, 
he moved to Sheffield with his family aged seven and left school at 13 
to start work as an office boy in a steelworks.

He became an estimator and steel 
inspector before eventually selling insurance for Refuge Assurance until
his retirement in 1968.

During the war he served in the RAF with 201 Coastal Command, as a corporal based in  Scotland.

Mr Tarrant met his wife Phyllis in 1922 and they married in Sheffield 11 years later, the day after Ralph’s 30th birthday.

He has two daughters, seven grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren and three great great grandchildren.

Mr Tarrant said: ‘There’s no secret to getting old.

Ralph as a young man. His memory is still sharp as a tack and he can clearly recall getting into trouble in a playground dispute

‘There’s no need to live too carefully, I smoked until I was 70 and I still enjoy a drink.

‘I don’t know what the future holds, but I’ll keep going as long as I can.’

His youngest daughter Chris Carter, 
67, who flew in from the US to organise the gathering, said: ‘It’s a 
very emotional day for the family.
