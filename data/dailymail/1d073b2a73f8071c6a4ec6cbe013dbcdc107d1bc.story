The explosive revelation threatens to destroy Mr Salmond's claims that a separate Scotland could use its oil wealth to transform the economy

A devastating private dossier for SNP ministers has sparked warnings that independence could trigger higher taxes or deeper spending cuts.

Internal briefing documents, seen by the Scottish Daily Mail, expose the huge risks in Alex Salmond’s flagship policy to put North Sea oil revenues in a savings account for the future.

The explosive revelation threatens to destroy Mr Salmond’s claims that a separate Scotland could use its oil wealth to transform the economy.

One of the papers, written by a top economic adviser to the government, explains that Scotland ran a deficit for 20 of the last 21 years – even during the boom years.

If Scotland had been independent throughout that period, the expert states that oil revenues would have been required to fund vital public services such as the NHS, schools and policing.

The analysis, written for ministers in March last year but only published now under Freedom of Information legislation, concludes: 'Given Scotland’s fiscal position since 1990, if the Scottish Government had adopted any of these rules in the past there would have had to be an accompanying reduction in public spending, increase in taxation or higher borrowing to ensure that the public finances continued to balance.'

The publication of the private papers comes only days after the Scottish Government’s fiscal commission working group released a public report that recommended the creation of an oil fund.

Last week, Finance Secretary John Swinney said the ‘economic rationale’ for a fund is ‘powerful’ and he went on to blast Westminster for failing to put aside oil revenues in past decades.

Yesterday, a government spokesman insisted that a separate Scotland would be running a budget surplus before investments are made into a savings fund.

But former Chancellor Alistair Darling – chairman of the pro-Union Better Together campaign – yesterday accused the SNP of trying to ‘deceive’ voters.

'Last week they said they could set up an oil fund at no cost,' he said.

'It is now clear that their own private advice says that there would need to be tax rises, spending cuts or more borrowing – or all three. The SNP have quite deliberately set out to deceive the Scottish public.

'This internal SNP paper also confirms that, in all but one of the last 20 years, all the oil money has been spent on public services in Scotland yet SNP ministers tell us it’s just a bonus and not the basis of our economy.

'Scotland doesn’t have to be faced with 
this choice. Being part of the UK means we have the strength of a bigger
economy without the risk of oil volatility.'

Women are a 'key barrier' to Alex Salmond's dream of independence, according to new research.

Analysis by the non-partisan What Scotland Thinks organisation has found that 66 per cent of women are likely to vote No in next year's referendum, based on latest polling figures.

That compares to 53 per cent of men, using data from various polls carried out between July and September.

The 'gender divide' suggests women are less willing to give credence to Mr Salmond's claims.

What Scotland Thinks states: 'The uncertainty about independence felt by women is a key barrier to a Yes vote.'

Norway set up its own oil fund in 1990 and currently has around £450billion put aside - making it the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world.

In contrast, the UK government – in line with other large nations such as the US – spends the money it raises through offshore taxes on public the services and uses it to keep personal taxes low.

According to the government’s Fiscal Commission Working Group in a report to SNP ministers last week, money could start being put into an oil fund within a year of independence.

However, the private document written last March by Simon Fuller of the fiscal analysis team in the Office of the Chief Economic Adviser states: 'There has only been one year since 1990 when tax receipts have exceeded total public spending.

'This suggests that over this period 
North Sea receipts would have been required to fund public services in 
Scotland. Therefore if the Scottish Government had wished to establish 
an oil fund, it would have had to reduce public spending, increase 
taxation or increase public sector borrowing.'

A
second paper for ministers, with no named author or date, adds: 'There 
is likely to be significant demand, at least in the years immediately 
following independence, to use any additional resources to support 
public services and reduce public sector debt rather than investing in 
an oil fund.'

North sea oil revenues would have to be spent on essential public services, the report states

Last night, a Scottish Government spokesman claimed the papers ‘confirm exactly what we have said on this issue’.

'As the Finance Secretary has said, the assumption that Scotland would have to run an absolute surplus before investing in an oil savings fund "has been reflected in the Scottish Government’s early thinking on the subject", he said.

'However, these papers have been overtaken by the expert report of the Fiscal Commission Working Group, who have recommended that an independent Scotland should set up a stabilisation fund and a longer term oil savings fund.

'Based on the model outlined by the working group, Scotland could consider investing modest sums into a long-term savings fund without an offsetting change to public spending or taxation potentially as early as 2017-18.'

He added: 'Oil is the bonus rather than the basis for an independent Scotland’s economy.'
