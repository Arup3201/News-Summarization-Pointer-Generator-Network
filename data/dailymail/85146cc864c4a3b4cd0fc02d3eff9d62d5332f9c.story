An automatic block to protect children from internet porn has been ruled out by ministers, according to a leaked email.

It says that internet firms have been privately assured they will not have to bring in stringent filtering systems.

The revelation makes a farce of a consultation paper that was launched earlier this week asking for views on dealing with adult material.

Campaign: The Daily Mail is calling for a robust automatic block to filter out porn by default

The email says ministers ‘wholeheartedly support active choice’ in which parents would have to say yes or no to adult material when setting up an internet connection.

The Daily Mail is calling for a similar, but more robust, automatic block or ‘active choice plus’ system. Porn would be filtered out by default with users having to opt in to see it.

The campaign has been backed by Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz and Sara Payne, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah.

Support: David Cameron last month said there was
a clear case for looking at default blocks on explicit sites. The 
Mail's campaign has been backed by Sara Payne, right, the mother of 
murdered schoolgirl Sarah

Last month David Cameron conceded there was a clear case for looking at default blocks.

But this has been ruled out according to
the email sent on Thursday by Andrew Kernahan of the Internet Service 
Providers’ Association to 200 members including BT, Virgin, Sky, AOL and
Cable & Wireless.

‘I spoke to the Department for Education this morning about the consultation and they made it clear that UKCCIS (the UK Council for Child Internet Safety), ministers and the relevant departments wholeheartedly support active choice and not default filtering or the so-called active choice plus solution,’ he wrote.

‘The only reason they are consulting on this is because No 10 told the Daily Mail that they would consult and listen to all views.

Proposals: The Government launched a consultation paper an on 'opt-in' system, under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available

‘This is in line with what we’ve been told throughout – that government supports active choice.’

John
Carr, who sits on the board of UKCCIS, said: ‘I am astounded by the 
contents of this leaked email. It reflects a degree of cynicism which 
does not fit with my expectations of this Government in this area.

‘Potentially, it means this whole consultation is a sham with the outcome already pre-determined.’

Helen Goodman, who is Labour’s media 
spokesman, said: ‘This email is explosive. It is very important we have a
proper consultation which gives parents and children’s organisations 
the chance to say why they want to put children first. It is time 
ministers stood up for ordinary people rather than big business.’

The consultation, which was launched by children’s minister Tim Loughton last week, includes an option for ‘active choice plus’, which is favoured by child safety campaigners and many MPs.

This option is being resisted by internet companies, which make millions from adverts for pornographic websites.

In his email, Mr Kernahan, who is public affairs manager at the ISPA, described the ten-week consultation exercise as ‘essentially a questionnaire’.

Last night he said: ‘This was a private email sent to our members.

'It was my take on where we are, which is that the Government and UKCCIS support active choice.

‘The point of the consultation is to get more evidence and views.

'I don’t think this is a foregone conclusion. I was stating the current position.

‘This issue is out to consultation and our members will be making their views known. We do support active choice as the most sensible solution.’

But Mr Carr, who is also secretary of the UK Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘There is growing evidence of the damage being done to children by unrestricted access to hardcore porn.

'We have never said there should be no porn on the internet. But if you want to have access to it, you should have to prove you are old enough to access it.’

Tory MP Claire Perry said: ‘This is exactly what I would expect from ISPA who have been constantly resistant to the idea of changing anything.

‘This issue matters to millions of parents and ordinary people across the country.

'This is even more reason why they should make their views heard in the consultation.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It is simply not true that ministers have already made up their minds, regardless of what one official may have said.

'The reported comments do not in any way reflect government policy. We are seeking views and evidence from everybody.’

Officials yesterday shut down the consultation exercise website following a security blunder.

Site visitors were able to see other people’s confidential responses and personal details – including passwords and email addresses.
