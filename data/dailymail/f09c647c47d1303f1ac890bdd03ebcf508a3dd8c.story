The sun shone for the annual Appleby Horse Fair today, and young travellers made the most of it as they bathed their horses in the River Eden.

Dressed to make the most of the sunshine, the travellers plunged into the cool river to wash their steeds before selling them at the traditional horse fair.

The river was as popular with the horses as the girls riding them as temperatures soared in Cumbria and across Britain after a long and cold winter.

The horse fair, which runs from today until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the oldest fairs of its kind anywhere in Europe. Travellers and horse dealers gather at Appleby, in Westmorland, in the Eden Valley, Cumbria, to meet old friends, conduct business, but primarily to trade horses.

Traditionally they bathe the horses in the River Eden before grooming them and riding them fast along the 'mad mile' to show them off to potential buyers.

As well as horses, the fair also features market stalls selling food and other merchandise as well as fortune telling, palm reading and other live entertainment. Last year the fair was featured in the hit TV series My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.
