Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has penned an emotional tribute message to one of the club's fans who tragically passed away this summer.

Reds supporter Felix Byam Shaw, 14, followed Rodger's side across the country but sadly died on holiday in France on July 18.

And the Liverpool boss is sending a Liverpool shirt addressed to Felix to his family, saying 'You Never Walked Alone' and signing off with 'Your friend..' with his signature.

Felix's love for the club lasted right up until the end of his life - passing away in his favourite Liverpool jumper.

Friends have set up a Facebook tribute page for Felix where well-wishers can leave messages and memories but Rodgers offered his own personal tribute on the back of one of Liverpool's new yellow away shirts.

Heartfelt: Rodgers is currently on tour with Felix's beloved Liverpool in the United States
