Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyer have started very early talks about a possible deal in which the 19-year-old would cooperate in exchange for avoiding the death penalty, according to legal sources.

His defence team got a major boost yesterday with the addition of a prominent anti-death penalty lawyer who has managed to get life sentences for several high-profile clients.

A judge approved the appointment of death penalty expert Judy Clarke to defend Tsarnaev.

Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction during the April 15 marathon.

Three people were killed and more than 260 injured when two bombs exploded near the finish line

But judge Marianne Bowler denied, at least for now, a request from Tsarnaev's public defender, Miriam Conrad, to appoint a second death penalty lawyer - David Bruck, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law.

Tsarnaev's lawyers could renew their motion to appoint another death penalty expert if he is indicted, the judge said. 

The news that he could escape the death penalty for divulging information was reported on NBC News.

High-profile defendants: Clarke successfully 
represented Theodore Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber (left), and 1996 
Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph (right), both of whom received life
terms

Defense strategy: Like with most of her cases, 
Clarke got Jared Loughner, the gunman in the 2011 Tuscon, Arizona, 
massacre, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence

Clarke's clients have included the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski; Susan Smith, a woman who famously drowned her two children; Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph; and most recently Jared Loughner, who shot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the head.

All received life sentences instead of the death penalty.

Clarke has rarely spoken publicly about her work, however, at a speech Friday at a legal conference in Los Angeles, she talked about how she had been 'sucked into the black hole, the vortex' of death penalty cases 18 years ago when she represented Smith.

Legal success: Smith was spared the death penalty and was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison

'I got a dose of understanding human behavior, and I learned what the death penalty does to us,' she said. 'I don't think it's a secret that I oppose the death penalty.'

Bruck has directed Washington and Lee's death penalty defense clinic, the Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouse, since 2004. 

Meanwhile FBI agents investigating the Boston Marathon bombings have visited the home of dead suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's in-laws and carried away several bags.

CNN says at least one bag was labelled DNA samples.

FBI spokesman Jason Pack confirmed agents went to the North Kingstown, Rhode Island, home of Katherine Russell's parents yesterday. She is Tsarnaev's widow and has been staying there.

She did not speak as she left her lawyers' office in Providence, Rhode Island, later in the day.

Her lawyer Amato DeLuca says she is doing everything she can to assist with the investigation.

Lawyers have said that Katherine Russell and her family were in shock when they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Their mother calls the allegations lies.

President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday discussed terrorism co-ordination in the wake of the bombings.

Mr Obama expressed his 'appreciation' for Russia's close co-operation after the attack.

The suspected bombers are Russian natives who moved to the Boston area. Russian authorities told US officials before the bombings they had concerns about the family, but only revealed details of wiretapped conversations since the attack.
