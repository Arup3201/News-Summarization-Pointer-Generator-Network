Nightmare: Stuart Hunt has appeared in court more than 100 times in relation to a ban on clapping

Police have been ordered to carry out an investigation into an ASBO banning a man from clapping or laughing near his neighbours after a court ruled it was breaching his human rights.

In what is one of the UK's more unusual 
ASBOs, Stuart Hunt has also been banned from staring, waving objects and 
being rude and insulting in public.

He has appeared in court more than 100 times for alleged breaches of the order since it was first issued against him in 2007, yet in all that time he has never been convicted.

It was taken out against him by Highland Council after a spat with his neighbours Stuart and Shirley Latham, and remains in place despite it originally being imposed as a temporary measure only.

Mr Hunt, who lives in the Scottish Highlands village of  Drumndrochit near Loch Ness, has now accused Police in Scotland of conducting a conspiracy against him.

This week, during a civil case at Inverness Sheriff Court, Sheriff David Sutherland ruled Mr Hunt’s human 
rights had been breached because the order had never been regularly 
reviewed, nor had it been made permanent.

He added Mr Hunt’s challenge against the order was 'well-founded'.

After the hearing, Mr Hunt said there had been some 'pretty 
dark moments' over the years and claimed he had never been involved with
 the police before the order was imposed.

He added: 'In some ways the last six or seven years have just been a complete blur. Having your name dragged through the mud for this length of time - it has been a nightmare.

'I have been in court on a regular basis and each time it is doing untold damage to my reputation. My wife Kathryn has suffered quite a bit from stress and anxiety. We both have.

'Imagine having the police up at your door every five minutes. It has been ruled as unlawful, unfair and a breach of my human rights and it is time the council removed it.'

Mr Hunt is now hoping the order will be revoked once and for all. The ruling is the latest twist in a saga that began 10 years ago between Mr Hunt and the Lathams over shared access to their homes.

Mr Hunt had built speed bumps on their shared driveway claiming the couple were driving too fast. The case went to a civil court and the Lathams, who argued their cars were being damaged, won.

Mr Hunt was forced to remove the bumps.

The
 legal case cost him £200,000 and since then he claims to have spent about £50,000 fighting alleged breaches of his ASBO.

Mr Hunt has lodged a fresh complaint with Police Scotland. The force has also been ordered by the Crown Office to investigate allegations made by him that police officers have been involved in a 'criminal conspiracy' 
by keeping the ASBO in place for so long and 
attempting to secure breaches of it to justify its implementation.

'I have serious concerns about a number of police officers,' added Mr Hunt.

A Crown Office spokesman confirmed it had received a complaint, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further.

Police
 Scotland declined to comment on the complaint but said any grievance 
would be dealt with through its complaints procedure.

Highland Council said it was now considering its position on the matter.

The Lathams have remained silent on the order following their successful court case.
