Vodafone has apologised to a mother whose six year-old daughter found a home sex video on her 'as new' phone.

Laura Leconte Pais, 31, was given a fresh handset by the mobile giant when her Sony Xperia T broke, so she was not worried that her child played with it.

Staff told the mother-of-two that the secondhand handset had only been used briefly before it came to her.

But she was horrified when she heard moaning noises coming from its speakers as her daughter Stefanie looked for family photos on it.

Upset: Angry Laura Leconte Pais with the new phone, which was full of pornography, and was only discovered when her six-year-old daughter looked at it

She grabbed the handset and found a graphic video of a woman performing a sex act on a man before having full sex.

The phone also contained pictures of naked women from porn websites.

Apology: Mobile phone giant Vodafone provided the phone from their Ashford story and have said sorry to the victim

Portuguese-born Laura, from Ashford in Kent, said: 'I always take pictures of the family, so my daughter asked to look through them.

'I could hear she was on a video but it didn't sound familiar, so straight away I grabbed the phone off of her.

'When I played it back on my own and saw what it was, it was very upsetting.

'The phone should have been put back to factory settings before it was given to me.'

Laura, a professional interpreter, added: 'You try to protect your children from all these things, and keep them innocent for as long as you can.

'I was upset that I was exposed to it, and very upset that potentially my children could have watched a porn video.'

Vodafone said they were investigating why the video was left on the phone which was issued at its Ashford store on May 21.

The company has apologised to Laura, given her a new phone, and offered her a gesture of 'goodwill'.

A spokesman said: 'We are sorry to hear about this, and want to help our customer as much as we can.

'To do that, and to help her prove her case, we need her to give us the memory card itself.'
