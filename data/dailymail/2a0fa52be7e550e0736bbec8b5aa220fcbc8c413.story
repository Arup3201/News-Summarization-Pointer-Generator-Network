MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Vincent Tan has torn into Wigan Athletic, accusing ‘a racist chairman of hiring a racist manager’ as the storm involving Dave Whelan and Malky Mackay escalated.

On a day when the Football Association launched an investigation into comments made this week by 77-year-old Whelan — who could yet find himself banned from his own club — Cardiff City’s Malaysian owner delivered his damning verdict.

Tan, having already been branded a ‘Chink’ by Mackay in the exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist messages revealed by Sportsmail in August, has taken particular exception to Wigan chairman Whelan trying to justify his new manager’s use of the term.

Tan also criticised Whelan for using derogatory comments about Jews — as well as the word ‘Chink’ to describe Chinese people — in an interview with The Guardian.

Whelan has apologised and says he was misrepresented, although initial plans by Wigan to release a statement on Friday were abandoned after Tan’s attack.

‘This is a racist chairman hiring a racist manager,’ Tan told the BBC. ‘I hope that stops at two racists in Wigan, not snowballing to 2,000 or 20,000 racists in Wigan. I think he (Whelan) insulted the dignity of all Jewish people. I think he insulted the dignity of Chinese.’

On Friday, the FA confirmed an investigation had been launched into Whelan. ‘The FA is very concerned to read about the comments that have been attributed to Dave Whelan,’ said the governing body in a statement.

‘We take all forms of discrimination seriously. As with all such cases, this will be dealt with as a priority. The investigation is already under way and The FA’s Governance Division have written to Mr Whelan. He has three working days to respond.’

Sportsmail understands the punishment for Whelan could be severe, even if officials at Wembley struggle to find a precedent.

Players found guilty of racism on the field face a minimum five-match ban. When it comes to a club official the FA might yet point to the case of Northumberland FA official John Cummings, who recently received a four-month ban for telling a female referee her place should be in the kitchen. If the FA follow that path, Whelan could be banned from the stadium that is named in his honour.

But then anti-racism group Kick It Out has already questioned whether Whelan is a ‘fit and proper person’ to run a club.

Tan stressed the need for the FA to take action against Mackay too, even as Wembley officials continue to wrestle with the issue of public and private communication.

Mackay was appointed manager of Wigan despite being under investigation by the FA because of the emails and text messages he exchanged with former Cardiff head of recruitment Iain Moody.

Tan says he hopes the FA ‘considers carefully’ the case of Mackay amid claims, in particular by Whelan, that the 42-year-old Scot is likely to escape action.

‘If that is true and if the FA is taking this matter lightly, I must say I am very disappointed,’ said Tan. ‘The FA must understand that the whole world is watching.’

Tan cited the case of Donald Sterling, the ex-owner of American basketball team the LA Clippers. Sterling was forced to sell the club by the NBA after making racist comments to his girlfriend.

‘Will (the FA) be a regulator on football matters with teeth or a toothless regulator?’ asked Tan. 

Whelan's decision to hand Mackay a return to football has been widely criticised

Whelan, who has already seen one major sponsor part company with the club, also came under fire from leading members of the Jewish community.

Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Whelan’s comments were ‘outrageous and offensive and bring the club and game into disrepute’. Arkush said Whelan’s apology was ‘half-hearted’.

Arkush said: ‘His apology does not go far enough. You cannot insult a whole group of people, and then say, “I would never insult them”, and hope that’s OK.

‘We need to see a proper apology and full recognition of the offence caused. Whelan has a responsibility to set the tone for his players and supporters. Racism and anti-Semitism will prevail on and off the pitch if it’s acceptable and unchallenged in the boardroom.

‘We will be taking up the matter with the FA and Kick It Out.’ 

There was support for Whelan from Hull boss Steve Bruce, who worked under him at Wigan, and insisted he is not a racist.

Wigan captain Emmerson Boyce also welcomed Mackay’s appointment in his column in the Wigan Evening Post. ‘Looking at Malky’s record, Wigan have hit the jackpot in getting him here,’ Boyce said.

‘People make mistakes, things happen, and if he can get us promoted I’m sure people will be talking about the positives rather than the negatives.’
