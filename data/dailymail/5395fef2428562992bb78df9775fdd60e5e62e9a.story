Vitalii Sediuk, the Tinseltown 'prankster' who attacked Brad Pitt last month at a Maleficent premiere, was caught on video in a Los Angeles park dancing and jamming with a group of musicians - all while he is supposed to be completing community service picking up trash as punishment.

Footage released by The Hollywood Reporter shows Sediuk shaking maracas and dancing along with the musicians, before he is seen playing the conga drums. The website has also published a photo of Sediuk on a carousel.

Sediuk was sentenced to 20 days of community service after he attempted to attack Pitt at the May 28 premiere. He was already on probation for crashing the 2013 Grammys stage as Adele was presented with an award by Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull.

Sediuk said he only tried to give Pitt a hug in an interview with the Associated Press.

'I never hit, I never punched, I never slapped Brad Pitt in the face,' he told the wire service. 'This is absolutely false information.'

Pitt has spoken publicly about the incident, calling Sediuk a 'nutter.'

'I was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me,' Pitt told People. 'I took a step back. This guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so I cracked him twice in the back of the head - not too hard, but enough to get his attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just grabbing for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses.

'I don't mind an exhibitionist, but if this guy keeps it up he's going to spoil it for the fans who have waited up all night for an autograph or a selfie, because it will make people more wary to approach a crowd.

'And he should know, if he tries to look up a woman's dress again, he's going to get stomped.'

Pitt was making a reference to a May 16 incident, when Sediuk sexually harassed actor America Ferrera and crawled under her dress at the Cannes premiere for How to Train Your Dragon 2.

Earlier this year, Sediuk harassed actors Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio when he pushed his face into their crotches at red carpet events in January and February, respectively. He was also slapped by Will Smith when he tried to kiss him on the lips at a 2012 movie premiere.
