It’s one of the most unpleasant situations you can find yourself in on a plane – sitting next to a fellow traveller who doesn’t smell very fresh.

And passengers believe airlines can do their part to prevent such an uncomfortable scenario, with more than half of them calling on carriers to give out free deodorant to mask bad body odour, a new survey reveals.

A poll of 1,100 adult travellers by Cheapflights.co.uk found 52 per cent would prefer a stick of deodorant over any other in-flight freebie. 

Sniff test: More than half of respondents in a new survey want free in-flight deodorant along with other perks

Complimentary deodorant is included in welcome packs on some business or first class flights, but those travelling in economy aren’t so lucky.

And it appears many of those who fly in the lap of luxury are also getting the short end of the stick. A review of welcome kits provided by 27 different airlines found that only four included deodorant. 

Four in ten English adults – and 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and Ireland – have been lucky enough to enjoy the pampered experience of business or first class travel on a plane, the survey found. 

Passengers who have received a free upgrade from economy are more likely to get one by flirting than by pretending to be ill or other deceitful means.

Cheapflights.co.uk spokesman Oonagh Shiel said: ‘Many airlines go to great effort to ensure they anticipate customers' needs and expectations but it would seem sometimes it's the smallest of tweaks that are needed to the offering to really hit the mark.

‘After all, nobody wants passengers causing a stink.'
