Javier Manquillo is close to signing a two-year loan deal with Liverpool, according to Spanish newspaper Marca.

The Atletico Madrid defender looks set to seal a loan deal with the Reds after struggling to nail down a first team place under Diego Simeone last season.

Brendan Rodgers has been on the hunt for a right back as he looks to strengthen his squad ahead of the new Premier League season.

Marca are reporting that Manquillo will be loaned to Liverpool for the next two seasons with an 'option to buy' for a figure close to £4million.

Rodgers is interested in taking the right-back on loan with a view to a permanent deal, although reports in Spain of an agreement already having been reached are premature.

Manquillo, who has also interested Arsenal, would provide competition for England international Glen Johnson, who is in the final year of his contract but has reached an impasse with the Reds over a new deal.
