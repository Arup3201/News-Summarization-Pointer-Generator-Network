It’s took 60 designers to create it, 9,300 construction workers to build it and features 10,000 glass panels.

But Beijing’s stunning Yanqi Lake Kempinski hotel is finally on the verge of opening its doors to the public.

Shaped like a rising sun, the  hotel is said to symbolise prosperity while the unusual disc-shaped entrance represents fortune in Chinese culture.

The hotel was designed by Chief Designer Zhang Hai Ao and his team from Shanghai Huadu Architect Design Company.

‘We had an international team because we needed a critical view from people outside of China to give their opinion on modern contemporary Chinese architectural design and to enable us to broaden our ideas on how we can use our design to showcase the Chinese culture to the world,’ said Hai Ao.

Four suite options are available, with the 43 Panorama Suites offering lake and mountain views.

The cost of a room starts at around £150 per night.
