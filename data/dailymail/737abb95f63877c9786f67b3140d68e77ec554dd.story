This is the unusual moment when a man sets up a portable gas stove and starts a cooking demonstration on a train of commuters.

The amateur chef can be seen cooking with a frying pan on what appears to be stacked-up milk crates on a train on the Frankston railway line in Melbourne.

The video shows the man cutting up pieces of food with a pair of scissors and stirring it with a wooden spoon as stunned commuters watched and laugh in the background.

'You want them stems cut in quarters or so,' the man said in the video. 'Give it a bit of a stirrer'.

One woman is seen stepping onto the train and the man looks over at her and says: 'How's it going? I'll have a meal for you in about three or four minutes - lucky lady!'

'Alright, we're up to the garnish - got some mozzarella sticks for garnishing - where did I put those mozzarella sticks? Alright!' he said.

'Be careful, everyone always wonders how to get these sticks in six or seven perfect strands? I know it's a bit difficult - it's intimidating but don't worry about it too much,' as he talks to his audience.

'Just peel peel and count - one - two - three - four - five - six - cooking on the Frankston line!'

Commuters are heard counting along and clapping with him as he starts stirring his pan.

'You want that to sit for a second. You want that mozzarella sticks to become one in the dish [sic] so we want to see it melt in. 

'We don't like to waste time around here so while that sits for 30 seconds, I'm going to get some physical exercise done.'

While waiting for his dish to simmer, he casually starts doing pull-ups while passengers are heard cheering 

While waiting for his dish to simmer, he walks over near the door and starts doing pull-ups while the passengers are heard cheering him on.

The camera man is heard saying: 'Don't knock the f*****g fry pan.'

'That should be about perfect. Turn this one down now because I could hear people in the crowd getting a bit worried,' the man said while he adjusts his gas stove.

'Alright - let's have a bit of a stir.'

It is unclear what followed after the video ended but it seems his audience were in for a special treat.

The video was posted onto Facebook and has received more than 300,000 views since it was posted on Sunday by BJ Gallagher. A caption along the video said: 'Cooking on the Frankston line'.
