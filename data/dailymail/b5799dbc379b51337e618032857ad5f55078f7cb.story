An elderly woman has been taken to hospital with burns after a suspected gas explosion and large fire ripped through her flat in west London.

The woman was rescued by two men who suffered from the effects of breathing in smoke after the explosion and fire in the ground floor flat in Chiswick just after 3pm.

Firefighters evacuated 40 residents from the three floor property and a structural engineer is currently inspecting the damage.

A spokeswoman for London Fire Brigade said a 'large fire' at a five room flat was being tackled by around 30 firefighters and the incident is ongoing.

'Initial reports suggested an explosion but we are still investigating,' the spokeswoman added.

'The fire in Chiswick is under control. A woman has been taken to hospital. The cause of the fire & possible explosion is under investigation.

Meanwhile, earlier today a woman died following an explosion at a house in Crawley, West Sussex. Emergency services were called to a residential street at 12.30pm.

Sussex Police said a woman in her 50s was treated by paramedics but died at the scene in Banks Road in the Pound Hill area of the town.

A spokesman for Sussex Police said that it was not yet clear what had caused the explosion but that foul play had been ruled out.

'Damage is confined to the interior of the house and no other premises are affected," said the spokesman.

'A woman aged in her 50s was taken from the house, treated by paramedics but has sadly died at the scene shortly afterwards. There was not believed to have been anyone else in the house.'

Police threw up a cordon around the danmaged house and closed nearby roads to allow emergency services access to the area and for the scene to be examined by forensic specialists.

The body of the woman, who has not yet been named, was taken to a nearby hospital mortuary where a post-mortem examination was expected to be carried out tomorrow to establish the exact cause of death.

An inquest was also expected to be opened and adjourned later in the week, to allow further inquiries into the tragedy to be completed.
