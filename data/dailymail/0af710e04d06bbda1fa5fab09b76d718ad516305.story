In court: Rachel Farrell, 26, pleaded guilty to the affair with an 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania

A former high school teacher who was charged with having sex with a 17-year-old student on 'numerous occasions' carried out the trysts in her car and in Ramada Inns, it has emerged.

Rachel Farrell, 25, had only been married two months when the alleged sexual liaisons took place.

She was teaching reading to the 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania.

The 25-year-old later resigned and is also now divorced. She is charged with three counts of corrupting a minor.

Police also believe she may have had sex with three other students.

The teen, who is now 18, told police he and his teacher began communicating on Facebook and had sexual encounters with him 'numerous times at many different locations', including parking in secluded spots.

Investigators said some of the encounters took place at a Walmart parking lot and twice at a Ramada Inn in Tannersville,
 Monroe County.

Scandal: Farrell resigned from her teaching post at Bangor Area High School and got divorced

Police said she confessed to colleagues at the school that she had sex with two 17-year-old students, later also 
admitting it to county Detective Robert Righi.

Farrell was married in June 2010. The 
alleged affair is said to have taken place between August of the same 
year and January 2011.

Bangor
 Area High School superintendent Patricia Mulroy said the district 
confronted Farrell as soon it found out about the accusations against 
her and that the matter was turned over to county prosecutors.

Bangor Area High School is no stranger to controversy. A biology teacher fatally overdosed on heroin in 2009, while a male teacher's aide was jailed after admitting drug possession charges and of supplying drugs to students, one of whom went on to kill himself.

In 2010, a nude photo of a female teacher's aide was circulated on students' mobile phones.

Last week, elementary school teacher Shannon Alicia Schmieder was jailed for 40 years for having sex with a 14-year-old student.

It is by far the toughest sentence ever handed out by a U.S. court to an educator accused of underage sex.

The DA in Georgia said they imposed the strict sentence to show this will not be tolerated.
