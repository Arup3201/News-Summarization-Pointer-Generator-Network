A New Jersey animal rescuer was indicted Monday for animal cruelty after police said she hoarded hundreds of pigeons, small mammals, turtles and other creatures in her 95-year-old mother's $1 million home only to let them starve and die.

Authorities said the smell has horrific in the Little Silver home where Gretchen Rell allegedly had the decomposed creatures stacked five-feet high unbeknownst to her mother, who she told to 'never go into the basement.'

Many of the animals that Rell, a 20-plus year volunteer at the Monmouth County SPCA, left to wither in the home and garage were still sealed in their original carrying crates.

Unsettling: Gretchen Rell, a volunteer animal rescuer from Ocean Township, New Jersey, was indicted on Monday on charges she hoarded over 300 birds, reptiles, and mammals in her mother's $1 million home only to let them wither away and die

'Never go in the basement': Authorities say they found animals stacked 5-feet-high from floor to ceiling in the basement of her mother's home, where she warned her never to go

Authorities first discovered the stomach-turning stash of creatures back in March, when they arrested Rell.

'We have more than 300 animals and counting,' Monmouth SPCA's chief law officer Victor Amato told the Asbury Park Press. 'Ninety-nine percent are dead birds. Most of them are seagulls, pigeons, robins, wrens and loons.'

Investigators say they also found turtles, mice, rabbits, possums and other mammals too decomposed to identify 'stacked from floor to ceiling, five feet high,' according to Amato.

Rell's LinkedIn account lists her occupation as MCSPCA Wildlife Coordinator since April 1992.

'I am in charge of placing injured or orphaned wildlife with State Licensed Wildlife Rehabilitators,' Rell writes in the job description. 'I am also in charge of transportation to those rehabbers and facilities.'

Authorities
 say that instead of following through with her job and getting the sick
 and injured animals treatment, she took them home and allowed them to 
dehydrate, starve and perish.

Rell
 was once seen by a number chasing down and capturing an injured seagull
 on her mother's street, one neighbor told the Asbury Park Press. Area 
children were also known take injured animals to Rell.

Some
 neighbors had begun to wonder what Rell was really up to by the time of
 her March arrest and there were complaints of smells coming from her 
mother's home.

Gretchen Rell, 56, pleaded guilty on Monday to hoarding the carcasses of hundreds of animals at her 95-year-old mother's New Jersey home. She will be sentenced to probation and undergo mental health treatment

Sinking ark: The home contained the decomposing bodies of mostly pigeons but also contained various seabirds and ducks, possums, rabbits and mice--many of them in their original sealed crates from a rescue organization

Indicted: Friends called her the pigeon whisperer and her mother's neighbors even once saw her chase an injured seagull down the block, but as of Monday she's been charged with two counts of third degree animal cruelty

So how did she get away with hoarding so many creatures for so long?

'To be honest,' said Amato, 'when you were upstairs, you could smell a slight odor. It wouldn't be what you would expect with 300 dead animals.'

Rell's own residence, where she lives with her husband, is in nearby Ocean Township.

Authorities visited that residence and say they found 60 additional animals.

On Monday, Rell was indicted in Ocean Township on two counts of third-degree animal cruelty, rerports Philly.com.

The maximum possible sentence for the counts is five years behind bars. But even her accusers likely won't push for such a punishment.

'Gretchen was well intended. She is a nice person,' Amato told the Asbury Park Press in March. 'But what happens is they get overwhelmed and don't know how to ask for help. They get carried away. It's hoarding, no matter what.'
