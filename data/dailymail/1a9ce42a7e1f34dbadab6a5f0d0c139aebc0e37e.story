Conservative minister Anna Soubry questioned David Cameron’s immigration policy – suggesting that he was in danger of stoking ‘false fear’ 

A conservative minister last night questioned David Cameron’s immigration policy – suggesting that he was in danger of stoking ‘false fear’.

Anna Soubry, the outspoken defence minister, said she wanted to know why the Prime Minister has pledged to crack down on European workers claiming benefits.

In a colourful interview, she said the Government should not be ‘pandering’ to the view of parties such as Ukip, and warned there was a risk of ‘playing to people’s prejudices’.

The Prime Minister announced last month that he wanted to stem the flow of European migration by cutting in-work tax credits for EU migrants until they have paid taxes in the UK for four years.

But Miss Soubry questioned whether people were really coming over here to sign on to benefits, asking: ‘Is that the real problem?’

The comments highlight differences in the Conservative ranks over immigration following the party’s failure to meet its promise to cut net migration to tens of thousands.

Two weeks ago, figures showed net migration had risen by 78,000 over the past year to 260,000 – well above the 2010 figure of 244,000 – fuelled mainly by incomers from the EU. In a speech the day after the embarrassing figures were released, Mr Cameron unveiled plans to deny in-work benefits for EU workers for four years. These handouts top up low wages and are seen as a key ‘pull factor’ for incomers to Britain.

Interviewed on Radio 4’s PM programme, Miss Soubry questioned Mr Cameron’s insistence that benefits were drawing people to the UK – claiming that migrants were really interested in jobs.

She said: ‘I want to know and understand why my Prime Minister who I have huge amounts of respect for, I genuinely do, I think has done an outstanding job, I want to know why he’s come to that conclusion. Is that the real problem, that people might be able to claim benefits? There’s a danger that you create false fear and sometimes you play to people’s prejudices.’

She added: ‘It’s really important that we make it clear that the majority of people who come to our country come here to work these are good people.

‘Just because some people have a particular view, doesn’t mean to say that you should pander to it.’

This is not the first time Miss Soubry has made a controversial intervention. Last year she said Ukip leader Nigel Farage looked as though he has ‘a finger up his bottom’.

The defence minister also had a run-in with Mr Farage on Question Time, when she told him: ‘You do not talk facts; you talk prejudice.’

Yesterday she said several people had rung her to compliment her on tackling the Ukip leader. In her lively interview, she adopted a broad Australian accent as she spoke about a call she received from Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister’s Australian strategy chief.

She said: ‘The next day, my mobile went. I got, “it’s Lynton Crosby here… yeah, what you said last night, absolutely brilliant”. And I said: “Oh wow, great, thanks Lynton.”

‘The other person who rang me…was David Cameron, saying: “What you said last night… absolutely.”’ She went on: ‘The next person who said something…was Ed Miliband who actually came up to me the next night and said it was the right thing to say. And it was. We mustn’t ever forget that.’

Asked about Miss Soubry’s comments on the Government’s benefits crackdown, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has set out a very clear plan to control migration from within the EU.’
