Dozens of young British men are being trafficked abroad by Irish slave gangs who force them to work on multimillion-pound paving and tarmac scams, it emerged today.

They are recruited in pubs or on the streets by mafia-style travellers who promise free accommodation and good money.

But they often end up working from 7am to 11pm for under £10, with the threat of violence hanging over them if they do not toe the line.

Scam: Gangs within the Irish traveller community have been recruiting British men on the false promise of good money and free accommodation

The disturbing picture has emerged in a leaked report by authorities in Sweden, where many of the captives find themselves, according to the Times.

It reveals how the men are set to work on projects to pave or surface driveways in a dodgy trade worth £11million a year in Norway and £3million in Sweden.

The Project Troy report said: 'Many homeowners around Sweden report the same thing: the knock on the door and a well-dressed English-speaking man offering to pave the driveway.'

But the work is often left incomplete or shoddily done, leaving them to be dubbed the 'tarmac cowboys'. 

In Sweden alone, there have been at least 72 reports of trafficking and forced labour by members of the traveller community since 2007.

The report, by the intelligence section of Sweden's national Criminal Investigation Department, highlights the case of Oliver Hayre.

The 22-year-old died in 2005 when a fire started in his caravan while he had been living and working for Irish travellers on Lomma campsite, in Skane, Sweden.

Swedish police said there was no evidence of foul play, but the report called the fire arson and says that people living there were found to be 'impeding rescue efforts'.

Mr Hayre, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, had been offered work that would apparently earn him £900 a week, but his family said he was treated like a 'slave'.

His father, Martin, 55, said: 'They sent one of the family's grandfathers to the house to meet Oliver's mother, my wife. If he didn't do what they wished when they wished, ill would fall on his mother.'

Project Troy was triggered by intelligence suggesting a 'widespread occurrence of trafficking of members of the public by Irish and British tarmac and paving-layers'.

The UK Human Trafficking Centre, which is now part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the Association of Chief Police Officers has been involved in a Europe-wide investigation into the practice since 2008, but has not made the extent of its findings public.

A source from within the centre disclosed that there is evidence of 213 people being trafficked into, out of and within the UK by gangs between 2007 and early 2010, according to The Times.

More than half were British.

The source said: 'This is an issue which has been on the radar for a while and these figures are by no means exhaustive.

'The figure may well exceed this.'

British police have raided seven travellers' camps across six counties this year.

One of those included Green Acres caravan site, near Leighton Buzzard, where six members of the same family have been charged with slavery and forced-labour offences over the past two weeks.
