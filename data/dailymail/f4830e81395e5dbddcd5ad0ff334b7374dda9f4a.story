He was the accidental hero who stumbled upon an FA Cup and Champions League.

At least, that was Roman Abramovich’s take on Roberto Di Matteo – the trophy-prone fool.

For when Di Matteo triumphantly mounted the steps of the Allianz Arena, fists clenched, smile as wide as the Champions League trophy itself and screamed to his paymaster ‘I’ve done it’, the Russian returned a despairing look of ‘yes, you have, I’m going to have to make you manager now, aren’t I?’.

How dare the caretaker extend his remit to writing history with Chelsea’s first European Cup. How dare he back his owner into a corner.

His temerity was begrudgingly rewarded with a two-year deal. Within five months he was sacked. The accidental hero was now Abramovich’s intentional fall guy.

Di Matteo – save for the odd charming performance as a pundit – has not been seen since. Until now.

Back in management with Schalke 04, footballing fate has it that he will face his former club next month.

Chelsea fans were left angry after Di Matteo was replaced by Rafael Benitez at the end of 2012

It will be two years and four days since his inevitable Chelsea axe when the Blues travel to Gelsenkirchen in their penultimate Champions League group fixture.

For the away fans, it will be a chance to say a belated thank you and goodbye, rather than hello.

It was Rafa Benitez who replaced Di Matteo at Stamford Bridge and, throughout the former Liverpool boss’s reign, Chelsea supporters sang the name of their fallen favourite in the 16th minute of matches in recognition of the shirt number he wore during six years as a player.

The irony is, without Di Matteo’s contribution during those six years – he was integral to maxing Chelsea ‘sexy’ again – Abramovich may well have invested his roubles elsewhere.

The Italian also helped his side to knock Barcelona out of the 2012 Champions League

There were six trophies – two FA Cups, a Cup Winners’ Cup, a League Cup, a European Super Cup and a Charity Shield – during his time in West London, that silverware rebranding a club which had not won a domestic prize since the FA Cup of 1970.

To that end, Di Matteo’s goal after just 42 seconds of the 1997 final against Middlesbrough heralded a new era.

And what of that strike? A run from deep climaxed by a 30-yard blast which cannoned into the back of the net via the underside of the crossbar – it was a stunning reintroduction to the big stage.

His icon was etched in that one moment, his legend later cemented by two more Wembley goals. The first came in the League Cup victory, again over Middlesbrough, in the following season. Then, in 2000 and the last final beneath the old Twin Towers, Di Matteo scored the winner against Aston Villa.

A leg injury would curtail his career at just 31 but he returned to lead out Chelsea ahead of the 2002 FA Cup final with Arsenal, a gesture in ‘gratitude for the midfielder's contribution to the transformation of the club’.

Gratitude, however, was in short supply a decade on. Di Matteo is not the vindictive type to view next month’s meeting as an opportunity for payback or revenge.

Rather, he will accept the gratitude of the Chelsea fans with dignity. And you wouldn’t be surprised if his players on the pitch did the talking for him. Again.
