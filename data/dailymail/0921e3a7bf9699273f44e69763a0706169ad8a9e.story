Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu will boycott the Ballon d'Or ceremony in protest at the transfer ban imposed upon the Catalan club by FIFA.

The Catalans are not allowed to make any signings in the next two transfer windows because of a breach of rules relating to the signing of international players under the age of 18.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld FIFA's ruling after the Spanish giants failed with an appeal to overturn the ban, with Barcelona still relentlessly contesting the charge.

Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona was allowed while the club appealed against the ban on new signings, which is now in force after the CAS upheld the original sanction imposed by FIFA 

Bartomeu has contacted Sepp Blatter to inform the FIFA president of his intended absence from the January 12 award ceremony and insists the club are to sever all ties with the governing body for the duration of the ban.

'FIFA has not told us who made the original charge and during the period of the sanction we will not maintain any institutional relations with them,' Bartomeu said at a press conference.

'I have sent a stern letter to Sepp Blatter and I will not be attending the Fifa Ballon d'Or gala set for January 12.

Bartomeu said relations with FIFA will cease to exist during the period of the sanction

'This is not the end of the matter. I foresee the Barca case becoming a watershed in the football world, just like the Bosman case. However long it lasts, we will not lose this case.'

Barcelona forward Lionel Messi is on the three-man shortlist for football's top individual prize but is expected to lose out to Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo.

The club also have a number of players, including Neymar, Luis Suarez, Andres Iniesta and Xavi, who are in the running to be named in the Fifa FIFPro World XI.
