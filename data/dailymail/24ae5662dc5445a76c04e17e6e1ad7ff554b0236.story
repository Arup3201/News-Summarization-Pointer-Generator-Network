The National Football Museum in Manchester has a new exhibit: Robbie Savage's ponytail.

The former Wales midfielder and current BBC pundit was pictured having his trademark blond locks cut back at friend Howard Yuill's salon last week.

Now the 39-year-old commentator has given the chopped hair to the museum, whose curators appear delighted to add it to their collection of sporting memorabilia, which totals almost 15,000 items.

David Pearson, the museum's deputy director, told the Leicester Mercury: 'Robbie Savage's [haircut] is one of the iconic hairstyles to have ever featured in the Premier League. The National Football Museum is very interested in how we can include this small piece of football history in our collection.'

Savage has joked about the reasons behind his cut, claiming he wishes to 'grow old gracefully.'

On a more serious note, the midfielder, who started his career at Manchester United alongside the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, has twice in recent times mistaken his wife's passport for his own.

Savage almost missed his flight to Brazil with the BBC team for this summer's World Cup, after he brought the documentation of his wife, who also has flowing blonde hair, to the airport. Savage, who also played for the likes of Leicester, Derby and Blackburn, thanked British Airways for 'rushing me through' to the plane, before telling his 1.4 million Twitter followers '[I] nearly passed for her to be fair!'

Viewers could get their first opportunity to see Savage's new, shorter cut for the first time this weekend, should he appear on Match of the Day or with the BT Sport team, whom he has joined this season.
