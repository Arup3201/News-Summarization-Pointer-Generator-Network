Disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney says he doesn't understand the criticism or controversy after a photo was leaked last month of Carney partying with the notorious Corby sisters at a Balinese bar.

In the wake of his shameful dismissal from the Cronulla Sharks, the photograph put the 28-year-old back in the press for all the wrong reasons - but Carney can't grasp why.

Speaking for the first time since the controversy, Carney says, 'I'm not ashamed,' according to the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH).

'Someone asked me to pose for a photo... If people are kind or decent to me and ask for a photo I'm not about to be rude to them.  I'm not ashamed to appear in a photo with them... I don't see the big issue or the interest in the picture.' 

Trio: Todd was photographed partying with Schapelle Corby who was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago, and her sister Mercedes last week

In the snap, the sacked Cronulla Sharks player has his tattooed arms draped over the sisters' shoulders and a big smile on his face.

The photo was leaked to the media from a private social media account - and Carney believes that the picture came from the Facebook page of a mortified Mercedes Corby.

'I saw (Mercedes) the day after it hit the headlines and she was very apologetic. I don't hold it against her. She didn't do this to me,' Carney tells SMH.

Corby, 37, was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of cannabis to Indonesia.

And 29-year-old Carney has escaped Australia after his 'bubbling' scandal, which showed the sportsman urinating into his own mouth in a lewd photograph taken in a hotel toilet.

The 'bubbling' photo was and leaked on social media and led to him being sacked from his team.

Corby lives with her sister in Kuta, Bali, where Carney is currently holidaying.

Just three months after being released from jail she got back together with her Indonesian boyfriend Ben Panangian, who supported her while she was locked-up.

It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island.

On 16 July, Carney first graced his social media accounts since his spectacular exit from the sport.

He was all smiles with former Cronulla Sharks teammate Wade Graham, as the pair caught up mid-week for a sweet treat.

He captioned a photo: 'Always good company and laugh with this frick @wadegraham17 #waffles #yogurberry,'

Fans were supportive of Carney's return to social media, sending him well wishes, with one saying: 'Good on ya @tcarney86 bounce back bigger and better,' while another posed the question on everyone's lips: 'What are u going to do now after that thing u did @tcarney86.'

Carney's sacking followed years of controversy including run-ins with police and NRL officials.

In 2009, a full-frontal naked photo of Carney appeared on a rental phone in Canberra.

The telephone company apologised after a woman found the images on a phone she was loaned by a Telstra Shop while her handset was being repaired.

Career breaker: Todd cut a far different figure to that when he hit the headlines more than a month ago amidst his 'bubbling' scandal

In 2006, while playing with the Canberra Raiders, he was charged with drink driving and lost his license for five years. He was later caught driving while disqualified and failed to stop for police, which resulted in his being sentenced to community service.

He allegedly urinated on a man in a Canberra nightclub in 2008.

Later that year he was de-registered and banned from playing in the NRL competition until 2010 due to his on-going string of alcohol-related incidents.
