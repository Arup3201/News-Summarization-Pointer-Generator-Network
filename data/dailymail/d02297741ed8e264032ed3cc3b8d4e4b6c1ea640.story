The first close-up images of the massive asteroid Vesta have revealed a northern hemisphere littered with craters - including a trio nicknamed 'Snowman' - and a smoother southern half.

Running along the asteroid's equator are deep grooves - a surprise to scientists who did not expect to see such features.

Chief scientist Christopher Russell, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said last night: 'We're seeing quite a varied surface.'

Rough terrain: A set of three craters - nicknamed 'Snowman' - are seen in this image of the northern hemisphere of Vesta taken by Nasa's orbiting Dawn spacecraft from a distance of about 3,200miles

The images were taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft, which began orbiting the 330mile-wide rocky body last month and has now started to beam back incredible surface details that the team is only beginning to pore over.

It is the first time that Vesta has been viewed up close. Until now, it has only been photographed from afar.

Since entering orbit, Dawn has taken more than 500 images, while refining its path and inching ever closer to the surface to get a better view.

The probe will officially start collecting science data next week once it is 1,700miles from the surface. It will get as close as 110miles while it orbits Vesta for a year.

Vesta's southern section is dominated by
a giant crater, the result of a collision eons ago that is believed to 
have pelted Earth with numerous meteorites, or broken off pieces of 
asteroids.

The northern side is filled with older craters including three that scientists have dubbed 'Snowman'.

Vesta
is 'so rich in features' that it will keep scientists busy for years, 
said Holger Sierks, of the Max Planck Society in Germany, who helped to 
operate the camera.

Currently some 117million miles from 
Earth, Vesta is the second-largest resident of the asteroid belt, a zone
between Mars and Jupiter filled with hundreds of thousands of space 
rocks orbiting the sun.

The belt formed some 4.5billion years ago, around the same time and under similar conditions as Earth and the inner planets.

It
is thought that larger chunks such as Vesta could have merged into 
planets had they not been foiled by Jupiter's gravity. Despite being 
denied planethood, asteroids are of interest to researchers because they
date back to the early solar system.

Powered
by ion propulsion instead of conventional rocket fuel, Dawn slid around
Vesta on July 15 after a 1.7billion-mile cruise. Most orbit insertions 
are tricky because a speeding craft has to slow down or risk 
overshooting its target.

Since Dawn has been travelling slow relative to Vesta, the orbit capture was a ho-hum event.

'It wasn't dramatic, but it is exciting,' said chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Launched
in 2007, Dawn is the first mission to explore Vesta and Ceres, the two 
largest members of the asteroid belt. It is also the largest 
interplanetary probe launched by Nasa, measuring 64ft tip-to-tip with 
its solar panels unfurled.

Unprecedented: It is the first time that Vesta has been viewed up close. Until now, it has only been photographed from afar

Though
the $466million project was conceived long before the U.S. decided to 
send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025, the data gathered by Dawn should
help future manned missions.

After a year, Dawn will move on to Ceres, where it will arrive in 2015.

Unlike dry and rocky Vesta, Ceres is icy and may have frost-covered poles. Due to the possible presence of frozen water, Dawn will not be able to venture as close to Ceres' surface for fear of contaminating the asteroid.

The team does not plan to post raw images online as other Nasa missions have done. Instead, there will be just one picture released daily.
