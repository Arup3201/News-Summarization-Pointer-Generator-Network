Leicester have completed their first signing of the January transfer window with the capture of Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.

The 42-year-old will move on a free from the Blues - ending his 18 months service at the club.

Schwarzer's arrival to the King Power Stadium will be a welcome addition to boss Nigel Pearson as his side fight relegation.

Current first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is currently out injured - having suffered a broken metatarsal during a training session in December.

The Danish international's sustained stress fracture has seen Ben Hamer play in his absence - with the Foxes having conceded seven goals in five games since.

Schwarzer's experience will prove vital to the East Midlands outfit who sit four points adrift from safety at the bottom of the table.

The former Australian international's departure from Chelsea also indicates that Petr Cech is likely to remain at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season at least.

Cech has been linked with a January move away from west London after losing his place to Thibaut Courtois in goal; but that possibility looks remote as Jose Mourinho's side continue to fight on four fronts for silverware.
