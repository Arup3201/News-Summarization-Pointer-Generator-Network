Unite boss Len McCluskey (pictured) has called on Blairites to 'stop stabbing Labour in the back'

Union baron Len McCluskey came to Ed Miliband’s aid last night telling Blairites to ‘stop stabbing Labour in the back’.

The Unite boss rounded on Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn and John Hutton over their warnings that the party leader is heading for defeat.

Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour’s biggest donor, also urged Mr Miliband to ‘bottle the spirit’ of Greece’s far-left radicals, who have taken power in Athens.

Senior Blairites have enraged Labour’s high command in recent weeks by warning that Mr Miliband’s left-wing agenda will lose him the election in May.

In a speech to activists in Birmingham yesterday, Mr McCluskey said Labour should ‘ignore these blasts from the past’.

He added: ‘The electorate is today poised between fear and hope. Fear is the basis of the Ukip menace – blame someone else for all the problems, usually immigrants or foreigners, and seek refuge in an imagined past.

'But it is hope that is blossoming today as we have seen in last week’s magnificent election result in Greece.

‘Labour needs to bottle some of the Syriza spirit and take that anti-austerity agenda to the people here.

‘What it doesn’t need is the Blairite re-treads – the people who sucked the life out of the last Labour government – attacking every progressive impulse, like the mansion tax and saving our NHS.

'So I say to Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn and John Hutton – stick to counting your money, and stop stabbing Labour in the back.’ 

Mr McCluskey said Britain was ‘facing a fight for the future of our society’. He said Tory plans to tighten Britain’s strike laws after the election could result in widespread law-breaking by activists.

‘If a government with the backing of less than one voter in four tries to deny the rights of a movement of millions, we will treat that with the contempt it deserves,’ he said. ‘And if we are pushed outside the law, so be it. If Unite is ever to die, it will not die on its knees.’ 

Conservative Party vice-chairman Bob Neill said Mr McCluskey’s latest intervention was a sign of Labour’s ‘desperation’.

He added: ‘Ed Miliband is a weak leader whom no one listens to. He’s so desperate for friends he’s turned to Uncle Len. The unions buy the policies and pick the candidates, now they’re trying to restore order to Labour’s internal chaos.’ 

Unite has given Labour a £12.8 million since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010, and announced a further £1.5 million donation last week.

Critics warn that the scale of the donations give the powerful union undue influence over Labour policy.

But Mr McCluskey said Unite had a ‘duty to democracy’ to bankroll Labour, and suggested that further seven-figure donations are likely in the run-up to the election.

‘If we lose the election, we understand how much harder that life will be for the people we serve,’ he said.

‘That’s why I’m appealing to each and every one of you – step up to the plate. Do not stand aside from this battle, or let any doubts and reservations paralyse you. We are now facing the fight of our lives.’
