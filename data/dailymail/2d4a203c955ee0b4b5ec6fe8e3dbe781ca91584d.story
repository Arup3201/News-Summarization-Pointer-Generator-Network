A benefits cheat who falsely received more than £20,000 in payments after he claimed he could barely walk was caught on CCTV while heading to work 10-hour days as a butcher.

Carl Pearce first claimed incapacity allowance in February 2003, stating that he was 'unable or virtually unable to walk'.

But he failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) when he started working at a butchers in 2006 - and swindled thousands of pounds in benefits over the next seven years.

False claims: Pearce, pictured on CCTV, continued to receive benefits for more than seven years after he started working at the butchers in 2003. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence today

Investigators for the DWP received a tip off that Pearce, from Sedgley, West Midlands, was working at Melvin's Butchers at Cannock, Staffordshire.

The 55-year-old was filmed on security cameras as he arrived at work on two occasions. The footage shows him walking down the incline to the shop without any apparent difficulty.

Pearce was given a six-month jail sentence suspended for two years after admitting to illegally receiving a total of £20,178 by failing to notify a change in circumstance. 

Duncan Craig, prosecuting at Wolverhampton Crown Court, said: 'He stated that he was unable or virtually unable to walk but his circumstances changed in January 2006 when he commenced employment at the butcher's shop.

'It was discovered that he had been working there five days a week, ten hours a day, since January 2006.'

Miss Alisha Harris, defending, claimed Pearce suffered from a 'catalogue' of different complaints but had been able to 'manage' the pain through medication.

Repayment: As well as his suspended sentence, Pearce, pictured left and right as he walked to work in 2013, was ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid work. He has begun to repay the money claimed

Miss Harris said: 'When he first made the claim for benefits he was told that it would not need renewing. He did not know he had to update his circumstances.

'He suffers from arthritis, high blood pressure and depression.'

The court heard Pearce was still working at the butcher's shop.

As well as his suspended sentence, Pearce was ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid work. He has begun to repay the money claimed.

Recorder Anthony Lowe said: 'Whenever people read of fraud involving the state benefits system they get increasingly impatient of people like me.

'They think we should always send the likes of you to prison and they may have a point.

'But there are features of this case that make it slightly different.

'Undoubtedly you were entitled to benefit at the outset and nobody took the view that your condition required regular medical reviews.

'You may have been led into the belief that you were entitled to continue.'

Sian Fellowes, DWP Fraud Manager said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.

'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.

'Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'
