Martin Brundle believes Lewis Hamilton will be classed alongside his boyhood hero Ayrton Senna in the pantheon of all-time Formula One greats should he claim his third world championship.

Hamilton enters the new campaign, which gets underway in Australia on Sunday, as the favourite to defend the crown he clinched so dramatically at the season finale in Abu Dhabi last year.

Speaking at Mercedes headquarters in Brackley last week, Hamilton spoke of his motivation to emulate Senna by winning a third world title.

Lewis Hamilton could become an all-time Formula One great if he secures a third world championship

And Brundle believes the 30-year-old Briton must be considered in the same bracket as the great Brazilian, and Sir Jackie Stewart, also a thrice-world champion, should he defend his title in 2015.

'If Lewis had finished his career with one championship it would have been a travesty, but if he wins a third he is up there with Sir Jackie Stewart and Ayrton Senna', said Brundle, a veteran of 156 grands prix. 'He becomes one of the all-time greats.'

Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg are expected to renew their battle for the championship with Mercedes the class of the field in pre-season testing. 

The Silver Arrows, winners of 16 of the 19 races last year, boasted more mileage than any of their rivals over the winter, with the apparent pace to match.

But Hamilton's preparations for the new term have been hampered by his very public break-up from girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, the popstar singer who was in Abu Dhabi to celebrate his title triumph last year.

Brundle however, doesn't expect Hamilton's off-track issues to trouble him as it has appeared to do so in the past.

'I think he will be in a better place. I sense he is hungry and I think the Nicole thing happened a lot time before it became public,' said Brundle.

'There is no doubt about it, that he wears his heart on his sleeve and he very open about that, but his speed and his skill are so great he just drives through that.

'He has got to win consecutive championships which is always perceived to be particularly difficult, but he is going to have a dominant car again, so it is Nico Rosberg who he has got to race.

'Lewis was unlucky with reliability last year and if he just does the same thing again he will beat Nico. So, unless Nico has found a way to raise his game, what is going to put Lewis under pressure apart from himself?'
