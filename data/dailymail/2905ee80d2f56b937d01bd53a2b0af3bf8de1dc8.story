The government has launched an extraordinary attack on the United Nations for sending an inspector - branded a 'loopy Brazilian leftie - to Britain to criticise flagship welfare reforms.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps has called on UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon to launch a full investigation into why an official was allowed to issue an ‘outrageous’ report calling for the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ to be abolished.

Conservatives reacted with fury to the interference of a supposedly independent observer from an international agency more closely associated with providing assistance to war zones, famines and natural disasters.

Mr Shapps told MailOnline the government had no idea why Raquel Rolnik had come to the UK to ‘make a political point’ at a time when ‘there are 50million people living in shanty towns’.

Under the Government's welfare reform, social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced since April.

Ministers say the removal of the ‘spare room subsidy’ brings social housing into line with the private sector where renters do not get spare rooms for free. The change will is expected to save around £500 million every year.

But opponents including the Labour party have dubbed it the ‘bedroom tax’ – a term used repeatedly by Miss Rolnik after a two-week tour of the UK investigating the policy.  

She also appeared in photographs with opponents of the policy and met with newspapers campaigning against it.

Mr Shapps said: 'This report is an absolute disgrace. We think it is pretty serious when the UN turns up and issues a report on a critical area of policy.'

But Miss Rolnik remained unrepentant today, insisting the policy was causing 'great stress and anxiety' to 'very vulnerable' people.

After Mr Shapps appeared on the radio defending the benefits changes, Conservative MP Stewart Jackson wrote on Twitter: 'Loopy Brazilian Leftie with no evidence on bedroom tax (sic) masquerading as serious UN official on @BBCr4today demolished by @grantshapps.'

Controversy: The UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Raquel Rolnik, declared: 'My immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished'

Anger: Peterborough Tory MP Stewart Jackson used Twitter to condemn the remarks by Miss Rolnik

The Brazilian, who has spent much of 
her five-year UN post looking at human rights violations in countries 
including Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and Indonesia, has decided that Britain’s 
housing system is ‘going backwards’.

However, it has emerged that she failed 
to meet officials or ministers from the Department for Work and 
Pensions, and during her only meeting with the Department for 
Communities and Local Government, the spare room subsidy was hardly 
mentioned.

Mr Shapps told MailOnline: ‘It is pretty outrageous. She has done this all under the wire. The government was not asked or consulted. There was no official consultation.

‘I quite simply do not know the answer to why she came here. Who invited her? Why not Brazil where there are 50million people living in shanty towns?

‘She is clearly making a political point by allowing herself to be photographed with people campaigning against the policy.

‘I think the UN has got this totally wrong. I think she is in trouble with this. The General Secretary will have to come back with a full response.’

Controversial policy: The bedroom tax sparked fierce protests in London back in March

This is what Raquel Rolnik, the UN's Special Rapporteur on housing, said about the government's welfare changes:

‘My immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished.

'I was very shocked to hear how many people feel abused in their human rights by this decision and why - being so vulnerable - they should pay for the cost of the economic downturn, which was brought about by the financial crisis.

‘The right to housing is not about a roof anywhere, at any cost, without any social ties.

‘It is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night.

'It is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds, their local schools, work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights, like education, work, food and health.’

But speaking at a press conference today Miss Rolnik said she had been alarmed by anecdotal evidence during her factfinding visit to Britain.

Using the term coined by critics of the measure, rather than the Government's preferred ‘spare room subsidy’ tag, she said: ‘I would suggest that the so-called bedroom tax be suspended immediately and be fully re-evaluated in the light of the evidence of its impact on the right to adequate housing and general well-being of many vulnerable individuals.'

She went on: 'The right to housing is not about a roof anywhere, at any cost, without any social ties.

'It is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night.

'It is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds, their local schools, work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights, like education, work, food and health.'

Miss Rolnik's unprecedented visit has taken in trips to London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester where she has spoken to people on housing estates and at food banks.

She claims some tenants were contemplating suicide due to the changes, adding that the welfare reforms could constitute a breach of human rights laws.

Ms Rolnik's final report will be presented in Geneva to the UN Human Rights Council in March.

She claimed that the country was ‘going backwards in the protection and promotion of the human right to housing’.

Ruling: Cuts in housing benefit for those who live in larger homes with spare bedrooms is a breach of human rights, according to a UN inspector

But
 a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman dismissed Mrs Rosnik’s 
findings, saying: ‘It is surprising to see these conclusions being drawn
 from anecdotal evidence and conversations after a handful of meetings –
 instead of actual hard research and data.

‘Britain
 has a very strong housing safety net and even after our necessary 
reforms we continue to pay over 80 per cent of most claimants’ rent if 
they are affected by the ending of the spare room subsidy.

‘These
 changes will help us get to grips with the housing benefit bill which 
has grown to £24billion this year, and make better use of our housing 
stock.

'We’ve given councils £190million to support vulnerable residents who may need extra help.’

A Government source added: ‘The courts in this country have already ruled that the Spare Room Subsidy is lawful.

‘We
 are extremely surprised and disappointed that the UN has come here and 
is directly contradicting the decisions of our courts.’
