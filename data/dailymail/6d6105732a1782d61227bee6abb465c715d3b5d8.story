It is the oldest excuse in the book, told by fibbing school children for generations, but for one teenage girl the dog really did eat her homework - and it nearly killed it

Payton Moody, 13, from Englewood, Colorado, had just finished off her sweet-covered volcano for her eight grade science project when her pet ate it.

Unfortunately for her dog Reggie, the feast had been put together using more than 50 metal straight pins, and chocolate which is toxic to dogs.

Nailed it: Reggie, a two-year-old Labrador, devoured 13-year-old Payton's science project and had to be rushed to hospital to have dozens of nails removed from his stomach

Payton had put together her fake 
volcano using different pieces of sweets, including a chocolate mountain
 and blue M&M water, using metal pins to hold it all in place.

‘She used the pins because I didn’t want the hot glue gun around her younger brother,’ her mother Kara Moody, 46, told GoodMorningAmerica

However, Mrs Moody’s attempt at keeping Payton's brother safe backfired.

The
 two-year-old Labrador managed to knock the project over during an 
unsupervised moment and wolfed down the entire thing, pins and all.

Sticky end: Reggie had more than 50 nails taken out of his stomach and has made a full recovery

When the Moodys came back to their house, they put two and two together and rushed Reggie to the vet.

The
 yellow Labrador underwent emergency surgery to remove the 
pins and the chocolate, which, although a treat for humans, is toxic to 
dogs.

‘They were able to 
take most of the pins out with an endoscopy, but there were still six or
 so in the stomach, so I was called to take the remaining pins out 
through surgery,’ Dr Brian Van Vechten said.

Reggie
 has made a full recovery following his stint in the clinic and to top 
off the happy ending, Payton was awarded an A on her second attempt at 
her volcano.
