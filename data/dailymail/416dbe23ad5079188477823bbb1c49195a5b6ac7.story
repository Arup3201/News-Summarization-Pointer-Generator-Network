If you've always got your head in a book, you might be rather alarmed by Maskull Lasserre's paper creations.

The Canadian artist spends his days carving skulls and skeletons out of thick software manuals.Â 

It took around 200 hours for Mr Lasserre to sculpt this detailed skull from seven of the nerdy tomes using an angle grinder and router - a tool used in woodwork.

Well read: Canadian artist Maskull Lasserre spent around 200 hours carving this intricately detailed skull into seven thick software manuals

Well, that's one use for them: He used an angle grinder and a router to slice through the thick manuals

He has also carved a human rib cage into a stack of newspapers.

Mr Lasserre, 34, from Montreal, Canada, said: 'I am not interested in simply reproducing the trick of carving into books - this could become meaningless.

'Instead, each of my works needs to match a substance with a subject in a way that reveals them both in a completely new way.

Scale and polish? Mr Lasserre said he chose software manuals because they had had a conceptual link to the skull

'I approach my work as a test or experiment. I investigate the mechanical, aesthetic and conceptual potentials of both the technique and material.

'For the skull carving, I chose software manuals because they were the right size and had a bright-white page colour.

'But they also had a conceptual link to the skull. The information in them had been rendered futile after carving the brainless, and equally useless, skull into them.'

Intricate detail: Some of Mr Lasserre's work has been exhibited at his own gallery while other pieces have gone on show in the Museum of Art and Design in New York

Hard work: Mr Lasserre said paper was a very difficult medium to carve because of its grain and the fact the pages are not connected to each other laterally

He added: 'Paper is a very difficult medium to carve because of its grain and the fact the pages are not connected to each other laterally.'

Mr Lasserre also designed and created his own steel press which held the seven manuals tightly together.

He added: 'What I enjoy about my works is the process of creating them. The concentration needed means I tend to work in short bursts, maybe 20 to 60 minutes at a time, to achieve the best results.

'As finished objects, I can only hope that something of the care and attention that I invested in them is accessible to the viewer.

'I also hope that my works inspire my audiences and while also engaging in their interest and curiosity.'Video:  Maskull Lasserre creates his detailed sculptures in Groundbloom documentary
