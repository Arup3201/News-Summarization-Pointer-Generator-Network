With the economy on the critical list, you might expect a Tory business minister to be toiling day and night on plans for the recovery.

But such important matters can be put on hold, it seems, when a baby comes along.

Tory MP Matthew Hancock has decided to take a two-month break this summer after his third child is born.

The minister is behind moves to extend parental leave to fathers as well as mothers and make it interchangeable – a plan criticised by business leaders, who say it will create a huge financial burden for small firms and will discourage businesses from taking on staff.

Mr Hancock told the Daily Mail he was a supporter of the changes, which will come into force in 2015, and added: ‘I am taking paternity leave myself. It’s important to form a strong bond with your children.’

He will take the two weeks paternity leave that all new fathers are entitled to, but will add the MPs’ extended summer recess on to the end, meaning he will take around two months leave.

Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘While everybody would want to wish Mr Hancock and his family well as he becomes a father for the third time, it will rankle that he is granting himself a perk which is not currently available to anyone else.

‘There’s little that angers taxpayers more than when politicians live by one set of rules as they impose another set on the rest of us.’

Mr Hancock, 34, admitted his break was only really possible because of the ‘peculiarities of life as an MP’. He added: ‘I will be in the country and contactable. As a minister, you are always on duty if things crop up.’

The MP lives in Notting Hill, West London, in a road where similar homes go for up to £2million. He has a daughter, six, and a five-year-old son with his wife Martha, 36, who works part-time as an osteopath. Her grandfather, the 1st Baron Inchyra, was British ambassador to West Germany, and her great grandfather was the 1st Viscount Camrose.

Mr Hancock, a former adviser to George Osborne, has been tipped for high office – not least by himself. As a backbench MP, he compared himself to former Tory prime ministers Churchill, Disraeli and Pitt.

In office, he rejected his official departmental photo as ‘too dreary’ and asked for a more statesmanlike one from his website to be used.

Mr Hancock also raised eyebrows by missing a breakfast TV interview after sleeping in – he had been due to discuss the Government’s criticism of ‘shirkers’ claiming benefits. The West Suffolk MP, the son of a businessman, was privately educated at The King’s School in Chester and gained a degree in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford and a masters in economics from Cambridge.

Asked how Business Secretary Vince Cable felt about his impending absence, Mr Hancock said: ‘Do you know what? I haven’t asked him.’

Tory sources pointed out that technically he has to seek leave of absence from Tory whips, while the Department for Business said: ‘It will very much be business as usual, he will be on the ministerial duty rota.’

Family man: Mr Hancock said he had not asked Business Secretary Vince Cable about his impending absence, but a source close to the Liberal democrat said he would be 'supportive'

A source close to Lib Dem Mr Cable said: ‘As a family man, Vince would be supportive of Matthew juggling his responsibilities as a minister and father. We want to encourage fathers to share childcare and that means them playing a more active role.

‘Matthew is entitled to take paternity leave and his child is due to be born just before the summer recess. He works very, very hard throughout the year.’

A friend of Mr Hancock said: ‘He has hardly had a day off since he started and is taking leave by saving up his holiday. He will still be on duty, as well as being on hand to look after the baby. The normal criticism of Matt is that he’s a workaholic, it would be outrageous to paint him as lazy.’
