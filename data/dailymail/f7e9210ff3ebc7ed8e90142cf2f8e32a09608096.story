As the boulder smashed through the windscreen of her car, making a deafening sound as it twisted the metal chassis, Heidi Huber could only look on in shock.

The astonished motorist had just got out her the VW Lupo in a 
car park in Germany's Black Forest when the huge rock came hurtling down
a cliff face plunging straight into the driver's seat.

If she had waited in the car for two more seconds she would have been killed by the  one ton boulder.

Lucky escape: Heidi Huber had just got out her the VW Lupo in a car park in Germany's Black Forest when the huge rock came hurtling down a cliff face plunging straight into the driver's seat

Police say she was treated for shock and minor injuries caused by flying debris.

‘The woman had just parked and got out when the rock fell.

‘She heard a noise and in the next 
moment the rock landed on her car. It was a huge,’ said Breisach am 
Rhein police spokesman Mirko Steffl.

‘She certainly had a bit of a shock, but was lucky to only have lost just her car, not her life,’ he added.

Shocking: The astonished motorist watched her car get crushed by a one ton boulder just two seconds after she'd stepped out of it
