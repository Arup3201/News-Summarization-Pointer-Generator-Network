David de Gea has admitted he wants Cristiano Ronaldo to return to Manchester United but concedes any deal would be difficult to complete.

The Real Madrid forward left Old Trafford in 2009 for Spain but has revealed he would be open for a return to the Theatre of Dreams in the future.

Goalkeeper De Gea has become a key player for the Red Devils and would welcome the addition of the World Player of the Year to the United side.

David de Gea admits he wants Ronaldo to return to Manchester United from Real Madrid

'Of course I would like Cristiano Ronaldo to come to Manchester United,' De Gea told Goal.com, 'but I think it's difficult.'

United have already bolstered their team heavily during the summer with the £60million capture of Angel di Maria from Madrid, with Radamel Falcao also joining from Monaco.

The duo's impressive form since arriving at Old Trafford has drawn praise from De Gea who claims the pair have already adapted to the Premier League.

'They have adapted quickly, both scoring and supplying assists,' De Gea added. 'They will make us better as everybody knows how well they did in Spain [with Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid respectively] I hope they score a lot of goals for Manchester United.'

De Gea also admitted to producing one of his best United performances in the 2-1 win over Everton last Sunday.

The Spaniard saved a penalty from Leighton Baines and produced a string of superb saves to keep the Toffees at bay. 

'It gives you a lot of confidence,' De Gea continued. 'It was an important victory for the team and I will always remember it. It was one of the best [performances] I've had and most importantly because it ended in victory.

'There are days when you play a great game but end up not winning. So in that sense, it was a perfect match.'
