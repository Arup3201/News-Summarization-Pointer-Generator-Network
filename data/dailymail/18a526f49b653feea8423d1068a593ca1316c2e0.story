Thinking of picking up a bottle of wine for dinner tonight? It might be a good idea to give these bottles a wide berth as they currently are the ten most costly wines in the world.

The common assumption that old wine is expensive wine has held true, according to this list. And while the prices are astronomical, they have been described as some of the best wines on the planet.

Eight French wines made it into the top 10 list compiled by wine-searcher.com, as well as two bottles from Germany.

The common assumption that old wine is expensive wine has held true. All of the wines in the top ten list are produced in  France or Germany 

 

And although none of them come close to the world’s most expensive red wine – the £122,380 limited edition 12-litre bottle of Chateau Margaux 2009 sold in Dubai last year – their price tags are still eye-wateringly steep.

From France’s Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Romanee-Conti Grand Cru, Cote de Nuits which costs £8,310 for a bottle to Henri Jayer Echezeaux Grand Cru, Cote de Nuits, also from France at £2,196 these fancy tipples are best considered as investments.

According to wine-searcher.com, which compiled the list, wine prices fluctuate according to supply and demand, vintage, the economic conditions of the wine producing country, and age and maturation.

1. Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Romanee-Conti Grand Cru, Cote de Nuits, France, £8,310

Experts say this is the perfect Burgundy and in order to claim the appellation Romanée-Conti Grand Cru, the wine must be made from at least 85 per cent Pinot Noir grapes. The Archbishop of Paris once described it as ‘velvet and satin in bottles.’
