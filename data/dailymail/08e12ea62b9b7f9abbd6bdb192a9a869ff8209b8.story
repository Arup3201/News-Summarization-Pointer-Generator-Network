A Government forensic scientist has cast doubt on the theory that British businessman Neil Heywood was poisoned by cyanide

A top Chinese government forensic scientist has questioned the official cause of death of murdered British businessman Neil Heywood.

Wang Xuemei said the conclusion reached by Chinese authorities that Mr Heywood, 41, died from cyanide poisoning lacks sufficient evidence.

The statement by Mr Wang, who is with the government's top prosecutors' office, casts doubt on the official version of a scandal that reached into the upper levels of the Communist Party.

Wang Xuemei, an official at the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate, wrote in a blogpost on Wednesday night: 'I feel 
very pained, upset and scared that our court believed the theory 
[Heywood] was poisoned with cyanide.'

Mr Heywood's murder in Chongqing last year is at the centre of the issue, which has seen Chinese politician Bo Xilai ousted from the leadership.

Mr
Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was given a suspended death sentence last month 
after confessing to murdering Mr Heywood over a business dispute by 
pouring cyanide into his mouth.

Earlier this week, the Chinese former 
police chief who sparked the scandal when he disclosed the murder, was 
jailed for 15 years.

Wang Lijuan was convicted of defection, abuse of power, and other crimes after visiting the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in February.

He had revealed that Mr Heywood, who was found dead in November, had been murdered and that the wife of his boss was involved.

Mr Bo was chief of the Communist Party in the south-western city of Chongqing.

He was sacked in February having once been considered a strong contender for a top position.

Mr Heywood's death in a hotel was initially ruled an accident and put down to alcohol abuse, although friends insisted he was not a heavy drinker.

Wang is the first female forensic scientist to work for the country's highest level prosecution body.

Her comments come despite heavy censorship of the case online and little coverage in the Chinese media beyond reproductions of reports from state news agency Xinhua.

Wang queried why none of the normal symptoms of cyanide poisoning were cited in the accounts that emerged from Gu's trial or that of former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun.

An unofficial account of her trial attributed to a person in the court said Gu's defence team had questioned the scientific evidence used against her.

Her legal team reportedly said Wang Lijun took two blood samples yet found no traces of poison, while a third sample that he took – tested only four months later – found low levels of a toxin, apparently insufficient to kill.

Wang Lijun's trial is also said to have heard a recording the police chief made secretly of Gu confessing to him the day after Heywood's death, though no details were given.

In her blog post Wang Xuemei also suggested that the former police chief could have manipulated Gu. She wrote: 'In other words, Wang Lijun could easily have used Gu to do whatever he wanted to do.

'Who would benefit from Neil Heywood's death?'

'I don't care how long the blog is up there. I just want to tell people I feel humiliated.

'I think Chinese criminal doctors are not such idiots. I have done my duty and fulfilled my historical responsibility.'
