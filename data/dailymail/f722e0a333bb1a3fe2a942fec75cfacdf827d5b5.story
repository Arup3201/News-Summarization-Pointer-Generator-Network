The mother of a 21-year-old pregnant woman from Illinois who was strangled and then raped by her drunken supervisor has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her daughter's employer.

Alisha Bromfield was nearly seven months pregnant in August 2012 when she was murdered by Brian Cooper at a wedding.

The victim’s mother, Sherry Anicich, filed a lawsuit Monday accusing Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers of failing to notice 'a pattern of misconduct and violent tendencies' in Cooper.

The 37-year-old, who was Alisha Bromfield's boss, failed to take part in anger management counseling required by Grand Flower Growers, according to court filings cited by Courthouse News Service.

The lawsuit claims that the man was known to be 'emotionally unstable and violent,’ at times hurling items at employees.  

Last month, Cooper was sentenced to two consecutive life terms without parole after being convicted in May of two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. 

Cooper killed Bromfield, of Plainfield, Illinois, when the two were at a Nasewaupee resort for his sister Kellie Stryker’s wedding.

After strangling the expectant mother for refusing to be in a relationship with him, the man raped her lifeless body.

Bromfield’s unborn baby daughter, named posthumously Ava Lucille, was viable at the time but died as a result of her mother’s murder and sexual assault.

According to the lawsuit filed in Cook County Court by Bromfield's mother, her daughter was hired in 2006 as a merchandiser for Grand Flower Growers, a Wisconsin company that supplied blooms to Home Depot stores throughout Illinois.

Cooper also worked for Grand, but according to Sherry Anicich, Home Depot was in charge of ensuring the safety of its grower's staff.

‘Home Depot knew or reasonably should have been aware of this pattern of misconduct and violent tendencies on its premises, since Cooper would publicly decry Alisha as a 'whore' and 'slut' and had been known to throw items at employees,’ the lawsuit states.

Court filings indicate that Ms Bromfield repeatedly complained to Grand management about Cooper's unwelcome sexual advances, but her words allegedly fell on deaf ears.

In her suit, Mrs Anicich alleges that 
her daughter's complaints were not only ignored, but her managers even arranged for Cooper to be alone with Alisha. 

The
 slain woman's family are seeking unspecified punitive damages for the 
‘loss of love, support, guidance, affection and companionship’ of 
Bromfield and her child, Chicago Tribune reported.  

During
 his trial last June, Brian Cooper's defense was that the alcohol he had
 during and after his sister's wedding reception inhibited his ability 
to form intent. He has never denied killing Bromfield.

The civil complaint states that in 2012, Cooper insisted that Bromfield accompany him to his sister's wedding and meet his family.

Following the nuptials, the lawsuit claims, Cooper brought Bromfield to a hotel room he had booked where he continued 'his pattern of verbal and physical.'

The 21-year-old mother-to-be refused Cooper's advances, sending him into a homicidal rage, the lawsuit states.

The inebriated man proceeded to strangle Alisha as she begged for mercy for herself and her unborn baby girl. Once the woman was dead, the lawsuit goes on to say that Cooper undressed and raped her.
