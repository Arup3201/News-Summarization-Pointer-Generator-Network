Republican revelers at a summer barbecue watched in horror as a small plane performing an aerial stunt crashed and burst into flames, killing the pilot.

Randy Humble was said to be throwing toilet paper out the window of his Lake Amphibian airplane on Saturday, when witnesses said they heard the plane’s engine revving loudly and it suddenly dropped out of view.

The aircraft crashed in an open field near the picnic in Viola, Idaho, killing the 60-year-old pilot.

Tragic: Randy Humble's Lake Amphibian airplane crashed in an open field near a picnic in Viola, Idaho, killing the 60-year-old pilot

Humble was the only occupant of the plane.

He was a well-known businessman who owned a local construction company in Moscow, Idaho, Humble Homes, and was known by many of those attending the Summer Barbecue for the Latah County Republicans, according to a Latah County Sheriff spokesman.

‘He had been around here a long time,’ the spokesman said, ‘for the people at the picnic it was pretty tragic when they saw his plane crash.’

Humble's plane was one of two aircrafts that were performing for the event.

Sudden drop: Humble's plane had attempted an aerial stunt but then fell out of the sky

The second plane, described as a small
 Piper Cub aircraft, had performed a low altitude stall just minutes 
before Humble seemed to try and replicate the move. 

Walter Steed, Chairman of the Latah 
County Republican Party, witnessed the incident and said it looked as if 
Humble's plane was just not equipped to perform that kind of stunt.

'I was standing there watching,' Steed 
said, '[Humble's plane] just fell off to the side, I was hoping that there was a deeper
 canyon and that he would have enough altitude to recover but he 
didn’t.'

Raging flames: Guests at the picnic rushed to the crash site and tried to control the flames with fire extinguishers

A local news station, KHQ-TV, reported that Humble appeared to be throwing toilet paper out of his plane window shortly before the crash and Steed said he believed the paper was the pilot's attempt to make a streamer.

FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer only said that Humble’s airplane ‘stalled while dropping something at a gathering and crashed.’

Both the FAA and NTSB are now investigating the accident.

Community: Farm equipment was brought in to control the flames in the pasture where the plane crashed

A coterie of 60 to 70 people were gathered on an outdoor deck enjoying the air show when the plane suddenly dropped.

‘We did not see it hit, we saw it 
fall off to the right, into a rolling ridge and behind some trees ... but 
we heard it,' Steed explained.

Several guests jumped in their 
vehicles and rushed to the crash site. They attempted to use fire extinguishers to 
control the flames, but they soon ran out.

Then local farm equipment was brought in to keep the fire from spreading in the pasture where the plane had crashed and people used blankets to beat down flames.

Shock: Close to 60 to 70 guests were gathered for the Summer Barbecue for the Latah County Republicans when the tragedy occurred

Guests had gathered on 
Saturday in Viola, a town with a population of just a few hundred 
people, for the local GOP shindig.

The party, held at a private residence, kicked off at 4pm and was just getting in full swing when the tragedy occurred around 5:30pm.

The air show had been arranged by the owners of the home where the party was held and the local Republican group was not involved in the air show's planning.

The outdoor event was billed as the highlight of the local GOP’s fall social calendar - offering live music, a guest speaker, ‘time for visiting and lots of good food,’ according to the group’s website.

Candidates running for the state legislature and for the County Commissioner's Office were in attendance.

'Things got pretty quiet,' Steed said about the mood after the tragedy, 'We were going to have candidate speeches but after the crash, that was the end.'
