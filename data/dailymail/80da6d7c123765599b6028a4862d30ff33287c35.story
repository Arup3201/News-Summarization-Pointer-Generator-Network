A four-year-old girl who was hit by a mysterious polio-like disease that left one of her arms paralyzed showed how the condition still affects her on Monday evening.

Sofia Jarvis, who was two when she was struck by the illness, smiled for the cameras and held up her paralyzed left arm as her family appeared at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California for a press conference.

'I was with her in the ER when she was having difficulty breathing,' her mother, Jessica Tomei, from Berkeley, said. 'I know we are so lucky that she's here.'

Sofia became the first known case of the disease in 2012, and since, 24 other children between the ages of two and 16 have been hit by the disease. All suffered paralysis of one or more arms or legs.

Life-changing: Sofia Jarvis, whose left arm is paralyzed due to a mysterious polio-like disease, is held by her father Jeff Jarvis during a news conference at Stanford University hospital in Palo Alto on Monday night

While their symptoms appear like 
polio, tests reveal that none of the children have the disease that 
plagued 20,000 Americans a year before a vaccine was created in 1955.

Public health officials have not yet identified any common causes connecting the cases.

The
 illness is still being investigated and appears to be very unusual, but
 Dr. Keith Van Haren warned on Monday that any child showing a sudden 
onset of weakness in their limbs or symptoms of paralysis should be 
immediately seen by a doctor.

'The
 disease resembles but is not the same as polio,' he said. 'But this is 
serious. Most of the children we've seen so far have not recovered use 
of their arm or their leg.'

This is the case for Sofia, who first developed what looked like asthma two years ago. Her mother told MailOnline that she rushed Sofia to the hospital after she started wheezing and vomiting.

She spent four days in hospital after being diagnosed with asthma and was discharged - but Tomei said she knew something else was wrong.

Struck down: Sofia, from Berkeley, California, had the first known case of the illness in 2012

In hospital: Jarvis, who was two when she was struck by the disease, suffered breathing problems and loss use of her left arm. Her mother said she thought they were going to lose her

The toddler had full use of her left 
arm when she left the hospital but 24 hours later at a follow-up 
appointment, Tomei noticed the girl wasn't moving her left arm - and it 
has remained paralyzed.

'You
 can imagine,' her mother said at the press conference. 'We had two boys that are very healthy, and Sofia was 
healthy until that point. We did not 
realize what we were in store for. We did not realize her arm would be 
permanently paralyzed.'

Before the development of a vaccine in 1955, some 20,000 American children were infected with the illness every year.

The virus mostly affected children under the age of three, which is why it was also called infantile paralysis.

Polio is spread from person to person, mainly through ingesting contaminated food or water.

Most who become infected with the virus are asymptomatic, meaning they don't even get sick. But one to five in 1000 cases can experience paralyzation.

Most paralyzation cases are caused by spinal polio which leads to paralysis in the legs, and unfortunately for those who caught spinal polio before the immunization, there was no cure and paralysis was permanent.

Polio has since been eradicated in U.S. and most of the world. Only three countries have had polio uninterrupted: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria.

In the U.S., children receive four doses of the inactive polio vaccine (IPV) to guard against the illness.

Sofia has undergone intense physical and occupational therapy to restore function to her arm, but nothing helped.

She had surgery nerve transplant in April 2013 but Tomei says the family may have to wait a further two-and-a-half years before they know if it was effective.

Right now, Sofia's arm is completely flaccid and her muscles are shriveled from lack of use.

Sofia improved little after her illness and now has a paralyzed left arm, weakness in her left leg and some breathing problems. Otherwise, she is a happy, healthy pre-schooler, and Tomei is grateful the mystery illness wasn't worse.

'We know we are lucky that the virus did not affect other areas of her spine as that may have caused paralysis of her legs or worse, all four limbs,' she said on Monday.

Doctors are not sure if her illness was a 
virus or something else.

Van Haren said he has studied five 
cases from Monterey up through the San Francisco Bay Area, including two
 that were identified as the disease enterovirus-68, which is from the 
same family as the polio viruses. He said there have been about 20 cases
 statewide.

'We want to temper the concern, because at the moment, it does not appear to represent a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon,' he said, noting similar outbreaks in Asia and Australia.

Van Haren, who diagnosed Sofia, said polio vaccines do not protect children from the disease, but he stressed that it is still important for children to receive that vaccine.

Dr. Jane Seward of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said Monday that the research is still underway in California, and there are a variety of infectious diseases that can cause childhood paralysis.

Concerned: Sofia's mother Jessica Tomei, pictured, said the family initially had no idea she would never be able to use her arm ever again. Sofia's father and two brothers (one obscured, left) joined them

Relief: Tomei added that they were just glad that they did not lose Sofia to the mystery illiness

Any of a number of illnesses could be 
at work, and it's possible some of the cases had one infection and some 
had another. Regarding the presence of EV-68 in at least two cases, "it 
could be an incidental finding," Seward said.

Until officials get more information, Seward said they are not looking around the country for similar cases of EV-68.

The
 California Department of Public Health has not identified any common 
causes that suggest that the cases are linked, said Dr. Gil Chavez, the 
deputy director of the Center for Infectious Disease and state 
epidemiologist.

'Physicians and public health officials who have encountered similar illnesses have submitted 20 reports to CDPH, and CDPH has conducted preliminary tests on 15 of these specimens,' he said.

Mid-century disease: Iron lungs in the Hynes 
Memorial Hospital in Boston during the Polio epidemic sweeping 
Massachusetts in 1955. The vaccination was developed that year and children now receive four doses

'Thus far, the department has not identified any common causes that suggest that the cases are linked.'

University of California, San Francisco, neurology professor Emmanuelle Waubant said doctors believe, but don't have proof, that it's a virus that for most children shows up only as a benign cold. She said a few children, due to their biological makeup, are having much more serious symptoms and she hoped doctors would look for them.

'For a lot of the neurologists who have trained in the last 30 years, it's extremely rare to see polio or polio-like syndrome,' she said.
