A Knight Rider fan spent 10 years transforming a his run down car into a replica of Kitt - the car driven by David Hasselhoff in the classic 80s TV show. 

Scott Bainbridge, 30, spent £18,000 converting an unloved Pontiac Firebird into a car that looks - and sounds - like the hi-tech original.

The postman, who fell in love with Kitt when he first saw it on screen as a child, spends three nights a week working on his car - which needed new carpets, wheels and a custom-made dashboard.

Ready to ride: Knight Rider fan Scott Bainbridge (pictured with his car) spent 10 years transforming a his run down car into a replica of Kitt - the car driven by David Hasselhoff in the classic 80s TV show

Iconic: David Hasselhoff starred as Michael Knight in Knight Rider. Kitt had numerous special features such as Turbo Boost (which allowed quick bursts of speed or jumping over obstacles), the ability to drive 'himself'

Detailed: Mr Bainbridge spent more than £18,000 converting an unloved Pontiac Firebird into a car that looks - and sounds - like the original. Above, the custom-built dashboard inside his car looks like the original

Intelligent: The original Kitt interior. The 'brain' of KITT, essentially a supercomputer on wheels, allowed the car to think, learn, communicate and interact with humans. It was voiced by actor William Daniels in the show

He also carried out extensive welding on the 25-year-old vehicle, and added new wings,   new suspension and brake parts. One of the final touches was a coat of black paint.

But he insists, his work on the car is still not finished. 

Mr Bainbridge said: 'Knight Rider is sort of a combination between technology and a cool car, so when you bring those two together I fell in love with it.

'All the lights on the dashboard, the scanner lights and the car they used was a great looking car to begin with so it really won me over.'

The reincarnated Pontiac has the full Knight Rider dashboard and has been extensively altered to match the on-screen vehicle. 

Kitt, which stands for Knight Industries Two Thousand, was voiced by actor Michael Daniels in the original series.  

Committed: The father-of-two had to install a new engine (seen above) as part of the project. He wants to recreate the car so that it looks like the vehicle seen in the second series of the 80s TV programme

Stripped down: Mr Bainbridge spends at least three nights a week working on his project in his garage in Newcastle. Above, the 25-year-old car is pulled apart before the new engine is added

Passionate: Mr Bainbridge took this photo of the car while he was working on the the wiring, accessories, fuel lines and radiator of his Kitt. The hi-tech vehicle was finished off with a coat of black paint

The vehicle - a supercomputer on wheels - had the ability to drive itself and interact with humans, including its driver, Michael Knight, who was played by David Hasselhoff. 

Mr Bainbridge, father of two from Newcastle, said he is aiming to recreate the car as it appears in the second series of the original TV show. 

He said: 'I first got the car back in 2004, and it arrived on a low loader and it was in a very, very sorry state.

'It's taken me ten years to get it from what it was originally to what you see now - the whole interior has to be redone, all new dashboard, new carpets, new wheels, and that's just to get it to look like the Knight Rider car.'

Mr Bainbridge's Kitt said that the car attracts a lot of attention wherever he goes.

At weekends he takes the vehicle to shows around the country where Knight Rider fans can take pictures with the iconic car.

Work to do: Mr Bainbridge said that although to the general public the car (above, on the road) may look perfect - to Knight Rider fans there are many differences between his car and the original Kitt

Attention: Mr Bainbridge said that he gets a lot of attention when he takes his car out on the roads. The enthusiast thinks that it is because the vehicle brings back childhood memories for a whole generation

He said: 'I get quite a lot of thumbs up and people flashing lights on their cars and people taking pictures of me.

'I think it brings back a lot of memories for people when they see Kitt cruising down the road.'

But Mr Bainbridge insists he still has a lot of work to do on the car. 

He said that although to the general public the car may look perfect - to Knight Rider fans there are many differences between his car and the original Kitt.

He said: 'All the dashboard needs to come back out soon when I get my new set of electronics - that will take a while.

'There's other bits on the body work that need to get sorted out it so it will probably be getting painted for a third time and I've got new interior panels to put in as well.

'The plastics are a tan colour but mine aren't quite right so I've got a new set which need to go on which will make it look a bit more accurate.'
