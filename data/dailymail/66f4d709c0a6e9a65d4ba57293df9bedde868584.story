Bad reverse: Wayne Kevin Beard crashed a stolen car into Deputy Chief Constable's Mercedes

A car thief was caught in the act when he crashed a stolen vehicle into a luxury Mercedes belonging to the local Deputy Chief Constable.

Wayne Kevin Beard, 34, had been released on bail accused of harassing his partner, and was on his way home from court when he got tired of walking and stole the car.

The 34-year-old reversed the Fiat Punto straight into Durham Constabulary's Deputy Chief, Michael Banks' Mercedes, after which he attempted to headbutt the senior officer in a bid to avoid arrest.

On March 9, Mr Beard, from Bowburn, County Durham, was on his way home following his appearance at Peterlee Magistrates’ Court over the alleged harassment.

Enroute to his house he allegedly grew tired of walking and entered a village pub. He rifled through an unattended jacket on a coat stand, taking a customer's car keys and mobile phone, Jonathan Walker, prosecuting, told Durham Crown Court yesterday.

He used the keys to steal the Fiat, but reversed straight into Deputy Chief Constable Banks' Mercedes, parked just yards away.

The senior police officer was alerted at his nearby home, and came out to confront the criminal.

Beard, who by his own account was 'full of Valium, tried to avoid arrest by attempting to headbutt Mr Banks and threatening him, saying: ‘Today is the day you die.’

Mr Banks managed to dodge the attack and received a glancing blow, sustaining minor injuries to his upper lip.

The damage caused to both cars in the crash was estimated in excess of £5,000.

Beard
was arrested shortly afterwards as other officers arrived at the scene and although 
Beard complied with a breath test, he refused to provide a follow up 
blood sample to check if he had alcohol in his system.

Beard admitted aggravated vehicle taking,
assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, theft of the 
mobile phone and failing to provide a blood specimen.

Of all the cars: Durham Constabulary's Deputy Chief Constable Michael Banks was alerted about the crash at his home close to the scene and went to confront Mr Beard, who attempted to headbutt him to avoid arrest

Behind bars: Beard was jailed for two years at Durham Crown Court after admitting he was 'full of Valium' at the time of the car theft

David Comb, mitigating, said Beard, originally from the Midlands, accepts he has ‘a bad record of offending’ but had settled down in recent years, moving to the North-East, working and living with his partner.

Mr Comb added that following a five-year lapse in offending his recent problems arose after he became stressed with the onset of an expected child and began ordering valium from the internet.

Jailing him for two years, Judge Peter Kelson told Beard he has, ‘an absolutely appalling record’, despite an improvement in his behaviour in recent years until the latest incidents.

He added that given his actions on March 9, when, by his own admission, he was ‘full of valium’, a prison sentence was ‘inevitable’.
