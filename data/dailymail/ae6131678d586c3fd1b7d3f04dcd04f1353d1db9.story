Ordeal: Shoshana Hebshi was arrested and led off a Denver to Detroit flight in handcuffs after other passengers reported her and two men sat next to her of 'suspicious' behaviour

A housewife spoke today of the terrifying moment she was arrested at gunpoint on a flight after other passengers reported her as being 'suspicious'.

Shoshana Hebshi, who describes herself as 'half-Arab, half Jewish', was on board a plane between Denver and Detroit on Sunday when she was arrested along with two other passengers after a security scare.

But she was completely unaware she had been singled out, along with two Indian men sitting in her row - none of whom knew each other - before an armed SWAT team stormed on to the plane.

At the time, she had just sent a Tweet on her mobile phone saying '(c)ops in uniform and plainclothes huddle in rear of plane'.

Another
passenger had reported the two men as being 'suspicious', apparently 
after they got up to go to the bathroom in succession.Â 

Mrs Hebshi said: 'Someone shouted for us to place our hands on the seats in front of us, heads down.

'The cops ran down the aisle, stopped at my row and yelled at us to get up.

'One of the cops, grabbing my arm a little harder than I would have liked. He slapped metal cuffs on my wrists and pushed me off the plane.

'The three of us, two Indian men living in the Detroit metro area, and me, a half-Arab, half-Jewish housewife living in suburban Ohio, were being detained.'

In shock, she was held in small cell, strip-searched and then questioned by FBI agents.

'They had done some background check on me already because they knew I had been to Venezuela in 2001.

'They asked about my brother and my sister and asked about my foreign travel. They asked about my education and wanted my address, Social Security, phone number, Facebook, Twitter, pretty much my whole life story.

'I asked what was going on, and the man said judging from their line of questioning that I could probably guess, but that someone on the plane had reported that the three of us in row 12 were conducting suspicious activity.

'What is the likelihood that two Indian men who didn't know each other and a dark-skinned woman of Arab/Jewish heritage would be on the same flight from Denver to Detroit? Was that suspicion enough?

'Even considering that we didn't say a word to each other until it became clear there were cops following our plane?'

Mrs Hebshi was later released without charge, along with the two men.

But initial media reports claimed she and one of the other passengers had been 'making out' during the flight.

Frontier Flight 623, which had 116 passengers on board, landed without incident in Detroit at 3.30pm on Sunday - the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.

Security was already on high alert as memorials took place in the cities and the FBI released information on a credible but unconfirmed terror threat.

FBI Detroit spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said ultimately authorities determined there was no real threat on the Denver to Detroit flight.

'Due to the anniversary of Sept. 11, all precautions were taken, and any slight inconsistency was taken seriously, Ms Berchtold said.

'The public would rather us err on the side of caution than not.'

Mrs Hebshi has since vowed not to fly again on September 11.
