The Hong Kong billionaire playboy who offered nearly £40 million to any man who could turn his homosexual daughter straight, has now said that he hopes the ‘change’ will come naturally.

When Cecil Chao found out about his daughter Gigi's marriage to her partner of eight years, he publicly denied the union and retorted by offering 500 million Hong Kong Dollars to the man who could convince her to marry him.

The 76-year-old property magnate has now accepted 33-year-old Gigi's 'gay tendencies' but has made some heavy hints that he wants her to 're-consider her choice'.

Hope: Although Cecil Chao hopes his lesbian daughter Gigi will change, he has said he cannot force her

‘I'm not saying that she's not okay to be gay,’ Cecil Chao told ABC News 20/20.

‘I mean it's her own choice and her 
own tendency, but she should make sure she knows what she wants. Maybe
what she wants today is different [than] what she wants in the future.’

Ms Chao married her long-term partner 
Sean in a church ceremony in Paris earlier this year, but it was not 
until news of their union was printed in the Hong Kong tabloids that her
father promised the million HKD fortune to any potential male suitor 
able to walk Gigi down the aisle.

Ms Chao had already told her father about
her wedding, and said he was ‘surprised and unpleasantly shocked,’ but 
urged her not to make it public.

Married: Gigi Chao, right,and her partner Sean Eav, had a church blessing in France earlier this year

After a reporter asked Gigi’s partner Sean Eav in September when the two would be married, Ms Eav replied that they already were.

The following media attention prompted
Mr Chao to announce the ‘bounty’, the 33-year-old University of 
Manchester graduate recalls.

 ‘As the reporters had their mikes in 
his face, he just kind of goes, “No. No, she's not homosexual. She's 
not, she doesn't have gay tendencies. She's not married. In fact, I'm 
trying to find a husband for her. Why don't you guys try to help me. 
I'll offer 500 million,”’ Gigi Chao told ABC news/

In denial: Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, who claims to have slept with 10,000 women, still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he won't force her

When the plea for a man for Gigi spread over the world, the offers came pouring in.

‘War veterans from the US, someone 
from Ethiopia, from Istanbul, South America, Portugal, really just from 
all over the world,’ Ms Chao said.

'One American suitor wrote: "I’m interested in the offer. I am a male person, who also happens to be gay."'

Ms Chao insists she will not be ditching her partner – no matter the quality of man her father’s millions can buy.

‘My heart is taken,’ she said.

Ms Chao added that her father ‘s million dollar reward was an act of love and nothing else.

‘I am happy. And he knows I am happy. He just wants me to be more happy.’
