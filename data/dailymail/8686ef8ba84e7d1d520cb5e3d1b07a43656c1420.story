As movie chains across the country slowly begin to announce that they will not screen the upcoming Sony film The Interview following threats of a terrorist act similar to 9/11, some Hollywood- A-listers are doing all they can to make sure the public gets out and sees the film.

Judd Apatow, director Adam McKay and Mindy Project producer and star Ike Barinholtz all took to Twitter to denounce the threats, which come from the group Guardians of Peace, who are thought to be North Korean.

The group does not want to see the film released as it tells the story of two men sent to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Trouble: Hacking group Guardians of Peace have said a terrorist attack could befall any theaters showing The Interview, which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen (above)

Leading the way was McKay, the producing partner of Will Ferrell and director of such comedy classics as the Anchorman franchise. 

'F""k these terrorist threats. Now I'm going to see The Interview on Xmas day,' wrote McKay on Tuesday.

'The idea that threats r going to stop people from going to a theater & laughing is so bleak... Now I've never wanted to see a movie more.'

Barinholtz was a little less extreme, tweeting; 'The Interview is a fuc*ing hilarious movie and you should all go see it and not live in fear of some fuc*ed up country.' 

Apatow responded to him, writing; 'people will now want to see it to know why they are so afraid of it. So their plan to suppress it will ultimately backfire.'

Later in the night, Apatow took to Twitter again, saying; 'I am not going to let a terrorist threat shut down freedom of speech. I am going to The Interview.'

Dialed back: Mindy Project star Ike Barinholtz took some time to praise the movie on Twitter (above)

Very involved: Judd Apatow, the famed comedy director, voiced his opinion on Twitter (above) as well

Proud American: Apatow has been very vocal in denouncing the hackers

Early Tuesday, the hacking group Guardians of Peace, who have been systematically releasing email correspondence and leaking films after breaking into Sony's internal system, claimed an event similar to '11th of September 2001' would occur at theaters showing the film.

Sony soon told theaters that though they would not stop from distributing the film, they were not expected to screen it if they did not want to out of fear of these threats.

The Carmike Cinemas chain, which operates 278 theaters in 41 states, and California's ArcLight Cinemas. whose Hollywood location is one of the most famed and popular theaters in the country,both said Tuesday evening they would not show the film.

Also backing out is Landmark Cinemas, who have now cancelled the film's New York premiere which was scheduled for Thursday at the famed Sunshine Cinema in the city's Lower East Side.
