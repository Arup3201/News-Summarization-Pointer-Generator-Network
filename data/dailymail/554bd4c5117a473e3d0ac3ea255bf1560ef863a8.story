Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has sparked fury after comparing the Chancellor George Osborne to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.

Lord Kinnock, who led the Labour party to two general election defeats in 1987 and 1992, said the public had gullibly accepted Mr Osborne’s ‘lie’ that Gordon Brown was to blame for the recession.

He said this ‘big lie’ was the reason why Labour was still seen by the public as ‘the incompetent party’.

The remarks, published by the Evening Standard today, were made at a Labour party fundraising event.

He said Labour had borrowed £319 billion over its 13 years in Government – but this was dwarfed by the Coalition which had added another £465 billion to the national debt.

Lord Kinnock said: ‘Yet we have the reputation of being the incompetent party, the party not fit to govern, the party that can’t manage the economy.’

Lord Kinnock said Mr Osborne used the six months after the general election when Mr Miliband was fighting a leadership contest ‘to encamp that deep into the consciousness, the deferential consciousness, the believe-the-worst consciousness of the British people.

‘And it’s still “Labour’s fault”. Goebbels said if you tell a lie, tell a really, really, really, big one.’

Lord Kinnock said Labour had left office with a growing economy and the deficit going down.

He said: ‘But of course what George [Osborne] told everybody ...was what he had inherited was a Britain that was in danger of becoming Greece in the North Sea.’

Furious Tory MPs today attacked the comparison with the infamous Nazi propaganda minister.

Bob Neill, the Bromley & Chislehurst MP, said: ‘It is a very desperate comment and an unpleasant smear which shows that Labour have nothing positive to say on the economy.’

A Labour spokesman said: ‘Lord Kinnock was making clear how ridiculous and hypocritical the Conservative attack on Labour continues to be.'
