Brighton bomb hero Brian Murray, who died on March 16, was awarded the British Empire Medal for his heroism

An ambulance man credited with saving Norman Tebbit in the aftermath of the Brighton bombing has died.

Brian Murray, 76, was one of the first paramedics on the scene after the IRA targeted the Grand Hotel in the 1984 attack.

Mr Murray ran into the hotel before  he had time to put on his safety equipment to save politicians staying there during the Conservative Party conference.

He rescued Lord Tebbit, who was trapped on the ground floor, before returning to pull Chief Whip John Wakeman and MP Sir Walter Clegg to safety.

Lord Tebbit led the tributes to Mr Murray, who was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery.

He said: ‘My wife and I remain profoundly grateful to all of those in the emergency services who played their part in rescuing us and others at The Grand.

My recollections of that night are not unnaturally blurred but I remember the kindness and gentleness with which the paramedics including Mr Murray took me from the hands of the firemen who dug us out and took us to the hospital.

‘The last thing I remember of that evening was one of the paramedics, perhaps Mr Murray, asking me if I was allergic to anything. I said: “Only bombs”.’

Mr Murray, who lived in Brighton with his wife Gillian, 64, received messages at the time from the Queen and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who escaped the bombing, praising him for his selfless actions.

Describing his experience weeks after the outrage, he told how he heard a scream for help after entering the pitch-black lobby.

He negotiated live wires and dripping 
water until he discovered Lord Tebbit. Mr Murray gave him oxygen and 
dressed his wounds before firefighters carried him to safety.

He spent the next six-and-a-half hours
 working his way through the bomb shattered building, grabbing trapped 
survivors and hauling them to the front door before heading  back 
inside.

Mr Murray died on March 16 after developing ‘stomach complications’.

His son Trevor Murray, 38, who was 
himself praised as a member of the public for pulling a pensioner away 
from the path of an oncoming train, described him as ‘the perfect dad’.

He added: ‘He was everything that I 
aspired to be in terms of being a father, a family man and in work. 
There is a story of him that night where he carried a bit of scaffolding
 board up the crumbling stairs and made himself a makeshift bridge. He 
was incredible.’
