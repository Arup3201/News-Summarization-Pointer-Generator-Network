Sadio Mane has finally been unveiled as a Southampton player after the Senegalese midfielder was granted a work permit.

The £11.8 million summer signing joined his team mates on Friday but still hasn’t played for the Saints since his deadline day move from Red Bull Salzburg.

Having now received his work permit, Southampton boss Ronald Koeman will assess the 22-year-old’s physical state before determining if the winger can feature against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday evening.

However Mane, Southampton’s second most expensive signing ever, hasn’t played competitively since August 23 for Salzburg and might need time on the training pitch to regain full fitness.

Southampton announced the news on Twitter on Monday, posting pictures of the highly rated winger in a Saints shirt for the first time.

Koeman’s side welcome the Senegalese midfielder lying second in the Premier League after their best start to a top-flight season in 26 years, despite a huge squad overhaul this summer.
