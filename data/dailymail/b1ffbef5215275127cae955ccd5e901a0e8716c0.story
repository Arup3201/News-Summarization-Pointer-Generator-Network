If you've left your Christmas shopping until the last minute, the place to go for the best bargains this year is undoubtedly Moscow, with astonishing savings on leading brands due to the collapse of the Russian rouble.

On a range of glittering potential gifts, we found savings of thousands of pounds compared with British high streets thanks to the Vladimir Putin effect - and, what's even better, you can be there and back before Christmas Eve.

Savvy shoppers could be coming home with some of the most sought after items of the year - including those all-important Frozen toys, iPad Minis and even Cartier bracelets - while saving themselves almost £37,000.

Moscow's stores are currently putting the savings on offer during Black Friday to shame, with visitors to the country able to take advantage of prices which have remained unchanged since before the rouble's drop in value.

But it comes with a stark warning: analysts believe the country is on the brink of a recession, and Russians have been bulk-buying imported products ahead of the current prices rising - which has already started to happen. 

Parents can grab a bargain by travelling to Moscow to buy the latest Frozen goodies: these miniature figurines cost £5.82 less than they do in the UK

Significant savings can also be made on this Nikon camera - which costs just 2,970 as opposed to £4,769 in the UK - and thisTAG Heuer Carrera Calibre 6 Heritage Automatic watch, which costs £4,660 less in Moscow

There are also plenty of savings to be made if you fancy a new TV this December - this Samsung costs £162 less in Moscow than it does in London

Even flights appear to have dropped in price: we found a return trip to Moscow on Sunday, December 21, returning on Tuesday, December 23, for £199 with Transaero.

The falling rouble also means you will be able to stay at some of the country's top hotels for a third of the cost before the drop.

Previously, staying at a five-star hotel would set you back £300+ a night. 

But, according to booking.com, two nights at the iconic and luxurious Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya - where rooms boasts panoramic views of the city's historic centre - will set you back just £89 at the moment.

The historic Metropol, close to the Bolshoi Theatre and also Lubyanka the headquarters of the former KGB, is offering two nights for £158.

For a view of the Kremlin, you could opt for the National Hotel - where Vladimir Lenin lived after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 - for £173 for two nights.

Back in Britain, two nights at the Hilton on Park Lane will set you back somewhere in the region of £235.75.

Flights with Transaero to Moscow cost £199 next week - cheaper than many train tickets in Britain

The prices of top hotels have also dropped considerably since the rouble's troubles - staying at the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya will cost just £89 for two nights

 And then there's the cost of the goods in the shops. 

For example, toys based on this year's hit cartoon Frozen are significantly cheaper: you can get Elsa and her castle for just £25.50, instead of an eye-watering £44.99.

You can also save more than £5 on a set of the popular characters, which are selling for just £17.17 in the Russian city.

Savings can also be made when grabbing a few gifts for the teenagers. The latest iPad Mini, for example, is just £243, as opposed to £319 in the UK. 

Among the other bargains on offer is the prestigious Nikon D4S camera, at £4679 in Britain - found by MailOnline  on sale in Moscow for £2970, a saving of £1709.

Another is the TAG Heuer Carrera Calibre 6 Heritage Automatic Watch 39 mm, with a UK price of £8,250. This luxury accessory is available in Moscow for just £4,590.

For women, the Aquaracer is retailed in Britain for £4,495.00 while in Russia it is on offer for a more affordable £2,532.

Or the steel and ceramic diamond Formula from TAG Heuer sells for £1,995 in Britain, compared with £1,020. 

Fancy some Cartier for Christmas? The Paris Nouvelle Vague Bracelet is for sale at £47,800 in UK, while it was shown in Russia this week thanks to the rouble collapse.

More modestly, the Juste Un Clou Long Necklace which retails for £20,800 in Britain was priced at £14,891 in Russia due to Putin's sinking currency.

Our Moscow bargain-hunters also found a Versace bias cut military dress selling for £56.22 - compared to £1,690 in Britain.

From the same brand, a V-Ray Blue watch priced at £1,200 in London is selling in Moscow for £698.

Juste Un Clou Long Necklace is £œ5,909 cheaper in Moscow than it is in the UK

While buying Cartier's Paris Nouvelle Vague Bracelet in Moscow will save you £œ13,489 on the asking price in Britain

With other brands the savings were not so great but still significant.

For example, a rope detail tweed Stella McCartney dress  costing £1,475 in the UK was listed as £999 in Moscow. A floral printed silk skirt on sale for £920 pounds in Britain retails currently for £771 in Moscow.

However, taking advantage of these bargains isn't quite as simple as just hopping on a plane.  

British citizens travelling to Russia do need a visa, and this must be obtained before travelling. Luckily, this can be got on an express service - meaning you can get your visa within two working days. The standard service takes six working day.   

The collapse of the rouble triggered a spending spree 

The value of the rouble has tumbled on the back of the falling oil price and worries about the outlook for the Russian economy. 

The price of oil has plummeted in the last few months - which has hit Russia hard, as those two items account for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues. 

But Russia has also had to contend with being hammered by sanctions imposed by the West over its land grab in Ukraine.

The two things combined have seen the value of the rouble half.

This time last year, £1 would get you about  53 roubles. At the close of the markets on Tuesday, it would have got you more than 121 roubles.

There has been a bit of a recovery since that peak, with the rouble now hovering around 93 to the pound.

But the shops have yet to catch up: the prices are still about the same as they were last year - meaning your pound is now going far further in Russia.

However, this is likely to be short-lived: Russians have been rushing to the shops to stock up on imported goods before the prices go up.

Already, Apple and Ikea have started to up prices to reflect the change in the exchange rate.
