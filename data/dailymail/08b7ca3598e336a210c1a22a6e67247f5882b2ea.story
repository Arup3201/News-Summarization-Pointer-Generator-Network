The cities of New York and Los Angeles have been the backdrop for countless movies, with their iconic skylines lit up on the big screen.

But the look that has inspired generations of directors is about to be changed for good as LED street lighting is brought in.

While the switch to LED lighting means Los Angeles will save at least $7 million in electricity bills each year, the change iconic city settings seen in films like Collateral will be lost forever. 

The signature urban glow captured by
director Michael Mann has been replaced with a more clinical-looking shine after LA 
replaced more than 140,000 street lamps with LED lighting.

New York and several American cities are following suit, while in Britain areas of Manchester, London and Glasgow already have some LEDs installed.

Up until now, the artificial orange glow of street lamps has been a distinctive feature in films such as Collateral, where the eerie glow added to the tense thriller. 

Director Michael Mann had experimented with HD cameras during the making of the Tom Cruise thriller in 2004, as he tried to capture the essence of the city at night.

Lamps made from light emitting diodes - LEDs - are essentially filled with tiny light bulbs that, unlike traditional ones, don't have filaments that can burn out.

LEDs have a far longer life that regular bulbs, outshining them by thousands of hours.

However, some have an incomplete color spectrum, affecting how objects bathed in the light appear. 

Filmmakers already know how to compensate for changes in artificial light, but the spectrum of LEDs will create new challenges.

Another big change is that LED lamps shine white, which is great for night driving but not so useful if you are trying to shoot moody scenes like the ones in Collateral.

By switching to LED street lamps, Los Angeles and New York City will save $7 million and $14 million a year respectively.

He was so enamored with the way the city looked in the dark that he went to great lengths to capture it, even having a special coat of paint added to the central character's taxi to reflect the sheens found in various parts of LA.

Mann found the orange glow of street lamps and the HD footage were the perfect combination.

'He wanted to use the format to create a kind of glowing urban environment; the goal was to make the LA night as much of a character in the story as Vincent and Max were,' the film's director of photography Paul Cameron told The American Cinematographer.

But the signature urban glow captured by Mann has been replaced with a more clinical-looking shine after LA replaced more than 140,000 street lamps with LED lighting.

New York City is following suit, with former Mayor Michael Bloomberg announcing a plan in October to replace 250,000 street lights in the city, in a move to save $14 million a year in running costs.

The change means that filmmakers will need to make the change to LED lighting, and begin an experimental phase of finding which ones work best.

'Every cinematographer is going to have their own taste for how something should look, and right now, there are still questions about how different brands of LED lights will interact on a set,' Chris Rogers, of rental company Cinelease, told Variety.

One of the obstacles facing lighting crews is how to make the LED glow look natural.

'The interesting thing about non-tungsten
 artificial light sources is that they often produce a non-continuous or
 incomplete spectral output,' Dave Kendricken of No Film School said.

'More simply, you can’t really put colors back 
in that weren’t there to begin with, even by gelling such a light source
 or color correcting in post.'

Once directors have come up with the perfect light balance for LEDs however, it is possible they will find them easier to work with.

'Whether the new look is 
visually preferable is a subjective matter, but you probably won’t find 
as many proponents for the old one,' Kendricken said.

''Especially considering that many of 
these LED fixtures lean toward a daylight balance, they may not only 
offer better overall color rendition, but also better conditions under 
modern cool-native sensors.'
