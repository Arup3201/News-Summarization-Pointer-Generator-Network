An ‘ultra-fit’ police officer died taking part in his first ever Ironman triathlon in New York, an inquest has heard.

Andrew Naylor, 43, was pulled out of the Hudson River during the swimming leg of the 140-mile triathlon.

A post-mortem examination revealed the father-of-three drowned after a blocked artery caused him to have a heart attack.

Andrew Naylor, 43, was pulled out of the Hudson River during the swimming leg of New York's 140-mile Ironman triathlon last year after he suffered a heart attack which caused him to drown

Just a week earlier he and a friend won a gruelling endurance race in Hong Kong where Mr Naylor was a police superintendent.

He was one of 2,500 athletes taking part in last year’s Iron Man U.S. championships in New York.

He was about an hour into the 2.4 mile swim, the first part of the race, which was due to followed by a 112 mile bike ride, and then a marathon over a 26.2mile course, when he fell ill.

Victoria Broomfield, representing the Iron Man championships, said swimmers were supervised by several rescue boats manned by lifeguards and paramedics.

She said in a statement: ‘As soon as Mr Naylor was spotted in difficulty he was pulled out of the water and resuscitation attempts made while the boat made for shore.

‘An ambulance took him to a nearby hospital but he died later.’

Mr Naylor’s body was flown home to Anglesey, North Wales, where he and his wife, Lynn, have a home.

An inquest in Caernarfon heard the highly-decorated police officer would have been unaware of his heart problem.

Dr Tony Caslin told the hearing: ‘The abnormality in his heart may not have been identified and became apparent during a period of extensive exertion.

‘He may have had the condition over several years and may have been entirely unaware of its presence.’

Dr Caslin said the condition could have been easily treated if it had been diagnosed.

North West Wales coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones said: ‘Had he not been swimming in these extreme circumstances he would not have died in this way.’

Mr Naylor set his personal best time of two hours and 32 minutes in the 2009 London Marathon when he finished in 74th place.

He won the China Coast Half Marathon in 2008.

As an officer with the Criminal Intelligence Bureau, he was awarded the Student of Merit award for his ‘outstanding performance’.

He mainly worked in the counter-terrorism unit during his 20-year career, beginning when he emigrated from the UK to Asia in 1992.

The police officer’s mother Gaby said: ‘He was an ultra-fit athlete who had run in numerous marathons.

‘He had prepared for this event so well and was over the moon to be able to take part.

‘It is such a tragedy he has died. I am devastated to have lost a son.’

His wife, who did not attend the hearing, said at the time: ‘It gives me some comfort that Andy died doing something he loved, but we will miss him sorely.’

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
