James Rodriguez is regarded as one of the best players on the planet at present, but the Colombian star showed even he is prone to schoolboy errors on the football field. 

Rodriguez, who signed for the Spanish giants for £63million following some stellar performances for his country at the World Cup, was knocking the ball around at training with his Real Madrid team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Pepe before the midfielder showcased a poor first touch. 

The Colombian was then subjected to an merciless ribbing from Ronaldo, Pepe and co for his awful control.

Rodriguez took it all in his stride. Certainly, his team-mates appeared shocked that the midfielder was capable of misplacing a pass. 

Real Madrid will put the joking aside for the rest of the week as they gear up for Saturday's World Cup Final against San Lorenzo in Morocco.  

Rodriguez's passing blunders are a rarity as the midfielder has shone for Madrid this season
