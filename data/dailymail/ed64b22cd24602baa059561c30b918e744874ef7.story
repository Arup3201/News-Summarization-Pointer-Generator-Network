An 18-year-old man's body was pulled from a pond at the Central Michigan University campus on Sunday, after he went missing early that morning while visiting friends. 

The victim has since been identified as Michael Anthony Hartnett of Dearborn Heights, Michigan. His father reported him missing Sunday afternoon, informing police that he was an insulin-dependent diabetic. 

Local police tweeted his picture shortly after, listing him as a missing person.

Tragic: Michael Anthony Hartnett, 18 (pictured), went missing on the Central Michigan University campus early Sunday morning. His body was found in a pond near the library later that afternoon. His father told police he was an insulin-dependent diabetic

What happened? Hartnett's body was found floating in a pond near Park Library around 4pm - possibly the small body of water seen to the left of the library in this Google Earth view

Hartnett's friends last saw him early that morning, while he was visiting campus for the 90th annual homecoming weekend. 

Police were able to trace his cellphone pings to around 2am when the phone lost power near St Mary's Catholic Church and the library on campus.  

Mystery: The investigation into Hartnett's death is ongoing. An autopsy is scheduled to happen on Monday. It's still unclear what caused his death

Local authorities and Harnett's friends then conducted a search of the area and saw a body floating in a pond near Park Library around 4pm.

Two of his friends jumped into the pond in an attempt to retrieve the body, but police jumped in after fearing for their safety. 

A dive team was eventually brought in and recovered Hartnett's body three hours later.

The investigation into Hartnett's death is ongoing, and anyone with information is asked to contact the police department at 989-774-3081.

An autopsy is scheduled to take some time today.  

'We want to thank the students, CMU Counseling, the staff at St. Mary's, the Isabella County dive team, Mount Pleasant Fire Department and Mobile Medical Rescue for coming together in what clearly is a tragic incident,' Central Michigan University Police Chief Bill Yeagley said in a written statement. 

'Our hearts and prayers are with all of them.'
