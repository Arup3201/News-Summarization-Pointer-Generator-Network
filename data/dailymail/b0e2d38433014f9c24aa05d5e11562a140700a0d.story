A man with a suspended driving license has been accused of killing his wife and critically injuring their special needs son after losing control of their car and ploughing them down outside their home.

Michael Rivard, 48, told police that he was inside the vehicle in Quincy, Massachusetts when it started moving forward and when he tried to stop it, he hit the gas instead of the brake.

The car lurched forward and knocked down his wife, Beatrice, and their adult son, Michael Jr., on the sidewalk outside their home. She was pinned under the Lincoln Continental and died at the scene.

Michael Jr. remains in critical condition with internal injuries in hospital but is expected to survive.

Pained: Michael Rivard allegedly ran over his wife and critical injured his son outside their home

It was not Rivard's first crash; just three months ago, his wife needed to be cut from their vehicle after he crashed it into a telephone pole while he was allegedly under the influence of drugs.

Rivard tried to hide his face in his sweater as he appeared at Quincy District Court on Monday. He was unsteady on his feet and leaned on guards as they took him into the court.

He pleaded not guilty to charges including motor vehicle homicide, negligent operation of a motor vehicle, operating a motor vehicle after revocation, and impeded operation of a motor vehicle.

The judge ordered Rivard to be on a $10,000 cash bail, and his attorney, Raffi Yessayan, said his client was 'devastated' by the accident.

The death came after Rivard, whose license was revoked in 2011, climbed into his wife's car at 7.50am on Monday, police said.

Prosecutor Debi Curley said Beatrice, 67, and her son were walking around the corner when the car darted onto the sidewalk, hit them, snapped a utility 
pole and knocked over a fence.

One neighbour, Eliza Bergstrom, told the Boston Herald she heard screams and saw Rivard's son under the car.

'He was screaming, "My stomach, my stomach",' she said. 'I saw what I thought was a sweatshirt on the ground, then I realised it was his wife. I grabbed her hand, and it was limp.'

Neighbours ran to the family and desperately tried to rescue Beatrice from under the car, using brooms, jacks and shovels, but she died at the scene.

History: Rivard has been in four car crashes since 2011 and has had his license permanently suspended

Curley said Rivard told an officer at the scene: 'I canâ€™t believe I just ran them over.'

Police took Rivard into custody and said he often drove without a valid license. Records show traffic violations, crashes and license suspensions dating back to 1987, according to the Patriot Ledger.

He has had four car crashes since June 2011 and his license has been indefinitely suspended 
on several occasions - most recently in June.

In August, he hit a telephone pole and rescue crews needed a machine to remove Beatrice from the passenger seat, prosecutor Debi Curley said.

'Police found him in the middle of the street, foaming at the mouth, with white powder around his lips,' she said.

Home: The couple, who lived in Quincy, MA, had been married for 31 years and had two adult sons

Rivard was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs, but was later released. On Monday, the judge revoked his bail in the case.

According to their marriage certificate, Michael and Beatrice Rivard married in 1982 when Beatrice was 37 and Michael was 18.

Yessayan asked the judge to release his client on his promise to return to court so that he could plan his wife's funeral - but Rivard has been kept behind bars.

'As a result of this accident, he lost his wife of 31 years, his special-needs son is in the hospital in critical condition,' Yessayan said. 'He wants to be able to bury his wife.'

Rivard will return to court on December 14.
