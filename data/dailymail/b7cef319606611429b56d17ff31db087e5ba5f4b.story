Lukas Podolski's international future is in jeopardy if he doesn't quit Arsenal in January.

The German international is on the peripheries of Arsene Wenger's plans, and has hardly featured for the Gunners this season.

And Germany boss Joachim Low has warned Podolski his place in the international set-up will come under threat if he isn't playing regularly.

Lukas Podolski has made just four appearances for Arsenal this season, all have come from the bench

Podolski has already admitted he is open to leaving the Emirates Stadium due to his lack of playing time.

And Low's words of warning is likely to push the German closer to the Arsenal exit door.

He said last week: 'Of course I am not happy with my situation right now. I can’ t be satisfied with that.

Germany boss Joachim Low told Podolski he has to play for his club if he wants to play for the national side

'We’ll see what happens in January. It is hard when you can’t do what you love.

'I don’t know why that is, you’d have to ask my coach in England

'If you can't play then you can't say he's not playing well or he has a crisis if you're not given the chance.

'If you only come in for eight or 10 minutes it is hard to get into the game.'

Podolski is likely to seek a move away in January, and will not be short of suitors if he does
