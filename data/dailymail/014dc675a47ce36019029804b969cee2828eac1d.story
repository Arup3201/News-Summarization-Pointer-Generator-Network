Real Sociedad sporting director Loren has praised the work done by coach David Moyes since taking over the Spanish club in November.

The former Manchester United manager replaced Jagoba Arrasate, who was sacked last year after a dismal start to the season left the Basque club in 19th place in La Liga.

The 51-year-old Moyes has since led Real Sociedad away from the relegation zone and into ninth in the standings with 10 games of the season remaining.

'It was hard for us to replace Jagoba,' Loren said in an interview with Spanish sports newspaper Marca. 'But the team needed to react and it certainly has done so.

'Our immediate aim has been achieved.

'I think the first thing that David (Moyes) did when he arrived was to try to give the team more solidness and consistency, and you can see that he has achieved that.

'The team is improving.'

Moyes is under contract with Real Sociedad for another season.

'We were fortunate that a man that initially appeared inaccessible to Real Sociedad, ended up coming here,' Loren said. 'I believe he (Moyes) is giving a big contribution.'

Loren believes the arrival of Moyes will open the door for the arrival of British players to the club in the near future.

'It's difficult to bring players from England, unless you have something that can attract the players,' Loren said. 'With Moyes here, the task of bringing players from there (England) can be made easier.'

Real Sociedad return to La Liga action on Saturday when they play away to Malaga.
