This is the moment a brave buffalo charged three lions after they grabbed a young calf from the herd.

The hungry lions crept up on the buffalo and calf in north-west Tanzania, East Africa, causing them to disperse in a terrifying 90-second ordeal.

While the majority of the buffalo escaped, one animal turned back and stood firm against the lions in a bid to protect its young.

But the big buffalo rallied and stood between her young and the lion's teeth while charging horns-first at the circling predators.

Three lions took the opportunity to surround their prey and closed in on the calf.

But the outnumbered buffalo could not hold them at bay and a young lion pounced and snapped away the baby between its jaws.

Only the quick-thinking reactions of the the adult buffalo saved young calf from death.

The 1,000 pound beast ploughed into all three lions just as they looked set to feast on the calf.

And the rest of the herd arrived just in time to mount a dramatic rescue and send the lions retreating with their tales firmly between their legs.

Amateur photographer Andreas Häntzschel, 39 from Aachen, Germany, captured the whole clash on camera while he was on safari.

Andreas said: 'I like the nature, I like travelling and I like to take pictures in a documentary style.

'This was absolutely unreal. This was amazing and you don't get a lot of chances to see something like it.

'To see lions is not too spectacular but to see them fighting is great. The buffaloes were very courageous to save themselves.'

Andreas, who works as a portfolio manager for an energy firm, used a Canon DSLR to take the snaps while filming with a Panasonic Video Cam.

He said: 'Most people ask me how I managed to see that and then they are happy to see the buffalo calf alive.

'But I was so angry that I didn't take my full HD camera with me.'
