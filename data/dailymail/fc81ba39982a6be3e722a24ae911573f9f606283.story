Gerard Pique has signed a new contract at Barcelona and immediately said he expects the club to rise from their curious slump.

The Catalans struggled under Gerardo Martino in failing to progress beyond the Champions League quarter-finals and surrendering the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid.

The central defender has penned a new five-year deal, which could see him finish his career at the Nou Camp, on the back of Luis Enrique succeeding Martino last week.

All smiles: Gerard Pique has signed a new contract at Barcelona until the end of the 2018/19 season

Here for the long-term: The central defender could end his career at the Nou Camp

And - even after a tricky 12 months - Pique is left in no doubt that the new boss can yield success.

'FC Barcelona have to be at the top, winning titles and feeling important among the elite of European and world football,' the 27-year-old said.

'We have a team, and a coach. We have all the ingredients to get back where we belong.'

Barcelona are clearly pleased to tie Pique down to his best years - president Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed he is 'the best centre-back in the world' - while the player himself sees no problem in retiring at the club.

Pique will be 32 if he sees out his contract - something the former Manchester United man is relishing.

'Knowing that I could live out my career here is a big boost for me,' he added.

'I hope we can enjoy as many successes as we have had already.'

The Barca squad never took to Martino's ideas and there appears to be renewed vigour around the place after Enrique was installed.

'I am very excited. In his press conference he showed that he’s very clear about his ideas. He knows this place well and I think he’ll do a lot of good for us.

'I am really looking forward to working under him.'

Let the good times roll! Pique hopes that Barca can regain their elite status under new boss Luis Enrique
