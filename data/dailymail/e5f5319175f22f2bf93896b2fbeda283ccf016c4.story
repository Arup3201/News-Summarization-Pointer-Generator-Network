Tottenham offered their support for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal at White Hart Lane before they faced Newcastle United on Sunday.

The fans bought poppies and placed them on the Poppy wall outside the stadium and showed their respects.

Harry Kane visited the impressive display, before he returned to Premier League action against Newcastle, and put a Poppy on the wall.

The Poppy Appeal is important both to serving soldiers and those no longer serving, particularly injured soldiers and their families.

They need to raise £40 million during the Poppy Appeal 2014 to continue to fund welfare work for Armed Forces families.

All money raised through the Poppy Appeal goes directly to their welfare work.
