This is the moment an innocent puffin trying to feed its young was robbed by a greedy gull.

Having scoured the Northumbrian coast for food, the helpless victim had not noticed a predator watching from a nearby rock.

It was not until he hit the jackpot and set off for home clutching a batch of five sand eels that the gull made its move.

Success: With a batch of sand eels in its iconic beak the doting parent gets ready to head home

Coast seems clear: He sets off, clutching the meal. Not far from his roost, it shouldn't be a long flight

Noticing a second too late, the puffin tried to change course. But the bigger bird was ready.

In an alarming display of survival-of-the-fittest, the pair tumbled to the ground of the Farne Islands in a bid to win the meal.

The incredible scene, captured by amateur photographer Steve Evans, escalated on dry land.

The determined puffin made a run for it on foot.

And despite being apprehended by the savvy gull, all was not lost for the breadwinner who proudly walked away with one of the two remaining fish.

Puffin enthusiast Mr Evans, 50, said: 'I saw the gull spot the puffin whilst on a rocky outcrop, as it took to the air, the puffin saw it and tried to change direction.

Shock: Out of nowhere a giant predator swoops. The black-headed gull tries to turn to grab the eels

Attacked: The puffin had caught some sand eels off the coast of the Farne Islands in Northumbria

'The gull attempted to hood its wings around the puffin and pecked at its fish-laden bill.

'The gull managed to dislodge a small sand eel, as this dropped from the air another bird spotted it and got to it before the gull.

'The gull managed to get a fish from the puffin, once this happened the gull seemed to leave the puffin alone.Â 

'It got back to its burrow with some fish intact.'

Puffins are phenomenal swimmers and hunters as they adopt a flying technique under water. In the air, they beat their 
wings rapidly, over 400 times-per-minute.

Plan B: The tussle moves to dry land where the determined puffin tries to leg it with his food still intact

Relieved but exhausted: Usually known for its speed, this puffin only took home some of his earnings

The black-headed gull is an arch-nemesis of the Atlantic Puffin breed, which resides in the British Isles.

To avoid danger, the black and white auks tend to fly together in confusing formations. Their fast pace and stark colours alarm predators.

Fascinated by these black and white creatures, known for their super-fast swimming technique, Mr Evans from Wakefield, Yorkshire, planned this photography expedition months ago.

Lucky: During the tussle a nearby tern made off with one of the prized snacks as the gull and puffin fought away

He said: 'For many years I have had an interest in the outdoors and the countryside, working several dogs on large Yorkshire estates.

'I have always had a liking for Puffins, this comical bird, but wanted to 
photograph them during the breeding season when they spend time on land.'

Lundy Island, the largest island in the Bristol Channel, near Devon, is named after the Norse word for 'puffin'

Puffins are the symbol of Newfound and Labrador province in Canada, and the namesake of Lundy Island (from 'lund', the Norse word for puffin).

The iconic birds are still hunted and eaten in the Faroe Islands and Iceland.

There are three types of puffin, which are members of the auk family.

The Tufted Puffin, an almost black creature, is native to the North Pacific.

The Horned Puffin, with a fleshy horn above its beak, resides in cold climates like Siberia and Alaska.

The Atlantic Puffin, or 'common puffin', is native to the North Atlantic and the British Isles.

Puffins are known for their ability to swim.

They soar through the water, flapping their wings as if flying through the air.

In a technique unrivalled by other land-based creatures, the black and white creatures have become adept at hunting.
