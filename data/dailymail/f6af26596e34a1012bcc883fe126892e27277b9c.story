Atlanta Falcons defensive end Osi Umenyiora describes returning to his city of birth for the latest International Series contest at Wembley as a 'dream come true'.

Umenyiora, who was born in London, will line up for the Falcons against the Detroit Lions on Sunday in front of over 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.

The 32-year-old spent his early years in England before his parents moved to Nigeria and then to Alabama in the United States.

Now in his 12th season in the NFL, Umenyiora has won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants and appeared in two Pro Bowls.

The defensive end moved to the Falcons in 2013 having spent a decade with the Giants and he appeared in the first International Series contest at Wembley against the Miami Dolphins in 2007 - which New York won 13-10.

He said: 'It's my second time coming back to England and it is a dream come true for me. I hadn't been back to London at all when I left and it had been over 20 years. Coming back in 2007 was a great experience for me.

'All I can remember about England was the weather and the rain because I was seven when I left.'

The Falcons will be making their first trip to England for an International Series contest as they take on the Lions in the first ever lunchtime kick-off at Wembley.

Having been part of the first game at Wembley seven years ago, Umenyiora has witnessed the growth of NFL in England since the International Series began and thinks the league are well on their way to giving London a team of their own.

'There are six teams coming over this year,' he said. 'Next year there might be eight teams and the year after that 12 and then maybe they will think about a team here full time.

'They're doing the right thing. It's a business and they have to expand and there's no better place to do it than here where there is a fan base.'

But Umenyiora thinks the NFL will have to find a solution to the logistical difficulties that moving a team to London would create.

He said: 'Logistics here would be the hardest thing because, as far as having a fan base goes, they'll have that here.

'Canada is right next to the United States and they have an NBA basketball team in Toronto. The Buffalo Bills sometimes play there as well so it is easier travel wise.

'The players will adjust to it. If I was getting paid, there's not much I wouldn't do. They have a fan base here to support a team and the players who come here will get on with it.

'What the NFL will have to do is have players that are from the UK. The people from America that live here would support the game first, but as soon as the people from England understand the game I think they will have a true feeling for it.'

The Falcons landed at Gatwick Airport on Monday morning and will practice at Arsenal's Colney base this week ahead of their game against the Lions on Sunday.

With the game kicking off at 1.30pm UK time, fans back in Atlanta will be watching the game at breakfast time. But Umenyiora is confident the early start will not be an issue either for the players or followers back home.

'They love football over there and they'll wake up at 4am to watch football if they have to so I don't think it will be a factor,' he said.

'I don't know how it's going to play out but we're going to be here for a whole week before the game so we will have a chance to adjust and maybe practice early in the morning or do something that will acclimate us.'
