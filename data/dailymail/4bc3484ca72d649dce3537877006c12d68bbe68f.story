A woman dubbed the 'neighbor from hell' has hit back at the family who say she terrorized them, claiming that she was the one being bullied and that the husband wanted to have an affair with her.

Lori Christensen, 50, from Minnesota, became notorious in 2012 for allegedly targeting her neighbors without good reason.

Police received more than 100 calls about her behavior which ranged from lewd gestures, abusive handwritten signs and one bizarre faux striptease.

Temper tantrum: Christensen defended herself in an ABC News interview in September and lost her temper at the interviewer

Fighting back: Christensen claimed to ABC News last month that her neighbor Greg Hoffman wanted to have an affair with her

Speaking to ABC's 20/20, aired on Friday, she insists that her trouble with Greg and Kim Hoffman stems from their jealousy of her and because 'Greg wants to have a relationship with me'.

'I had no interest in that at all,' Christensen added.

Even as the interview took place, Christensen was seen off-camera losing her temper and boiling over into a tirade of curses.

The Hoffmans began filming their neighbor in action when the taunting became unbearable.

They
 caught her performing a lewd dance - unbuttoning her clothes and 
revealing her legs - as their son celebrated his 12th birthday.

She also allegedly told the boy that he was the 'son of an alcoholic' in front of his friends.

Lewd: The neighbor appeared in front of her house on a regular basis to make rude gestures towards the people who lived across the street

Defiance: The 50-year-old said she was an assertive person who could hold her own

Aggressive gestures: The woman pinned these signs to her garage door but said they were not always directed towards the Hoffmans

She
 also pasted as many as 50 signs to her garage reading: 'Get a life', 
'the guilty talk the loudest' and 'I saw mommy kissing a breathalyzer' -
 a reference to the fact Mrs Hoffman is a recovering alcoholic.

Other accusations include making masturbatory gestures to Greg Hoffman and shouting: 'I wish you'd died' to his wife.

She told ABC she is not remorseful for saying this after Kim's relapse - when she spent time in hospital after a mixture of alcohol and prescription drugs.

'Why? Because that's was where she 
was headed,' she said. 'She was the scotch drinker, not I.'

The giant signs that covered her 
garage, Christensen said, were not always directed at the Hoffmans and 
maintains it was her first amendment right to post them.

When asked if she thought her 'striptease' was bizarre, she shot back that she thought it more bizarre that Mr Hoffman would film her and her daughter.

Her actions have cost her her government job, landed her in jail twice and got her barred from returning to her home and neighborhood.

But, she insists, she is not sorry for what she did and calls the subsequent events simply as 'speed bumps' in her life.

'Why do I have to live my life to make them happy?' Christensen asked. 
'They sat at home every day on their front step watching me and my 
daughter.

I'm assertive. I hold my own. But I'm also a very compassionate person. I've always been happy. I love life.'

The 50-year-old pleaded guilty in July to a felony charge for 
willfully falling foul of a harassment restraining order brought in May 
2012.

Relief: Christensen reserved much of her outrageous behavior for the Hoffman's children (pictured). Their son was called 'the son of an alcoholic' in front of his friends, the family claimed

Two
 felony charges were dropped as part of a plea deal that 
included, ten-years probation, a ten-year no-contact order with the 
Hoffmans and a ten-year exclusion from the neighborhood.

In the interview Christensen claimed not to care about being kept away from her home describing her old neighborhood as 'ghetto' and 'low-class'.

Last week, she tried to withdraw her guilty plea on the charges of violating a restraining order. The judge refused her request and a jury will now determine her sentence.

'It’s been a long road and just to have this behind us is so big,' said Greg Hoffman.

'It has been very difficult for our family and very difficult for the whole neighborhood,' Kim Hoffman said. 'It was unfair.'

The Hoffmans say the plea agreement, even without jail time, is fair.

Hellish: Christensen agreed to a plea deal that includes, 10-years probation, a 10-year no-contact order with the Hoffmans and a 10-year exclusion from the neighborhood

'We’ve
 never been out for blood. It’s just been we wanted our own freedoms 
back and for her to understand and take responsibility for her actions,'
 Kim said.

The Hoffmans moved to Homewood Place 16 years ago, and Christensen moved three years later.

Their
 daughters played together until Christensen's daughter poured nail 
polish on one of the Hoffman girls about five years ago.

When Greg Hoffman went to tell Christensen about it, she yelled at him to take care of his own children.

Inappropriate: The family filmed Christensen performing a lewd dance and unbuttoning her clothes opposite their home as their son celebrated his 12th birthday party

He told the Minnesota Star Tribune:
 'I said, "Lori, you may intimidate everyone else, but you don't 
intimidate us". Those were the last words we spoke to her for two 
years.'

Then in 2009, after
 Kim Hoffman was recovering from a hospital visit following a mixture of
 prescription drugs and alcohol, she caught Christensen screaming at her
 children and pulled them away.

Christensen shouted: 'Why didn't you have a little more Scotch? I wish you had died,' according to court documents.

Police
 Chief Lynne Bankes told the Minnesota Star Tribune he was stunned at 
the level of abuse, which appears to be entirely one-side.

Neighbour from hell: An elderly woman who lived next door to Christensen's home, pictured, reportedly moved out as she could not handle her behaviour

'In
 my 35 years as a police officer, I have never met or heard of anybody 
who is so persistent in their negative behavior toward their neighbors -
 or anyone,' she said.

However Christensen claims that the sheriff did not like her and once called her a 'b****'.

Over 
the past two years, Christensen was charged repeatedly for 
violating harassment restraining orders obtained by the Hoffmans.

Intimidating: They also filmed signs that read: 'Get a life you stalking freak' and 'the guilty talk the loudest'

It
 is not just the Hoffmans who have complained of abuse. One next-door 
neighbour has a court order forbidding Christensen from having any 
contact with her or her young daughter.

An elderly woman who lived on the other side moved as she no longer could stand the woman's behavior, Bankes said.
