A farmer and his sister were both killed in crashes in a bizarre double tragedy at exactly the same spot just six hours apart.

Emanuel Davidescu, 27, died instantly when he lost control of his car and hit an oncoming truck head-on along a motorway in Caras Severin, Romania.

Just a few hours later, his younger sister Maria Patrascu, 22, died on the same stretch of the E70 while heading home after being told of her brother's death, according to local news reports.

Horrific twist of fate: The wreckage of the car driven by Emanuel Davidescu, who died on a Romanian motorway when he struck a lorry head-on just hours before his sister was killed in a crash at the same spot

Her husband was towing a trailer with a tractor when it was rear-ended by a speeding car as she rode in it.

Her children, who were travelling in the trailer, were not hurt in the crash last Thursday.

A police spokesman said: 'It was a terrible tragedy. She was trying to get home after being told of her brother's death earlier in the afternoon.

'She also died instantly although her children who were in the trailer with her were unharmed.'

Double tragedy: Six hours after her brother's death, Maria Patrascu also died on the E70 motorway while riding in this tractor driven by her husband when it was rear-ended by a car
