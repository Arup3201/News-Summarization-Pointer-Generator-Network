Victoria Smith was attacked as she left a house party in Hull

A teenage model fears she has been left blind in one eye after a girl threw bleach in her face in a horrifying attack. 

Victoria Smith, 17, was leaving a house party near her home when she was allegedly ‘ambushed’ by a group of youths and subjected to the terrifying ordeal.

Yesterday Miss Smith – who claims not to have gone to school for more than a year after suffering a seven-year bullying campaign – described how the ‘excruciating’ attack has left her too scared to leave the house.  

Writing on Facebook as Toria Melody, the name she uses in her budding modelling career, she said: ‘One of my eyes is now physically impaired and I am blind in it, I will most likely never receive my vision in my right eye again.

‘The outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front.’ She says the acid has left her with burns on her body and ‘excruciating pain in my eyes’.

‘They are red raw, it went in my mouth, up my nose and I couldn’t breathe,’ she added. 

The teenager, a student at Wilberforce Sixth Form College in her home city of Hull, said she had only recently plucked up the courage to start leaving the house again after what she claimed was a campaign of bullying at her former school, Malet Lambert.

‘It took me a year to finally start leaving my house and going to college after not going to school for more than a year and being so terrified of people after being bullied for over seven years,’ she added.

‘This has 100 per cent set me back and I honestly cannot see myself coming out again for a long time.’ She added that if it hadn’t been for one of her friends, Bethany Wilkinson, ‘I would be completely blind and most probably dead’.

Another friend, Beth Ridley, posted on Facebook that ‘some sick b*****d set her up [and] got us to come to a gathering then threw bleach in Toria’s face and eyes’. 

She added: ‘Don’t understand how ya can do that to another person but thankfully she’s gonna be okay.’  

Miss Smith told police she was attacked at the junction of Albert Avenue and Cobden Street in Hull at 9.20pm on Wednesday as she left a house party with friends. She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary.

Hundreds of wellwishers commented on her Facebook post after reading details of the attack.

The 17-year-old model said she may never regain sight in her right eye after the attack which has left her scared to go out again 

Victoria said she had suffered at the hands of bullies for years before the attack and has now lost all her confidence

One wrote: ‘I don’t know you, but you
 are a shining star writing this showing that these bullies haven’t 
defeated you. Well done, you are a beautiful girl too, don’t let bullies
 make you feel low.’ 

Miss 
Smith later responded: ‘Thank you everyone so so much for all your 
support! It means the world to me I really appreciate it! 

‘Don’t know what I’d do without you all honestly, every single one of you have helped me a lot!’ 

She declined to speak about the attack at her family home yesterday.

Humberside
 Police have arrested a 17-year-old girl on suspicion of causing 
grievous bodily harm with intent. They said investigations were 
continuing after releasing her on bail and are appealing for more 
witnesses to come forward. 

No
 one at Malet Lambert School was available to comment on  Miss Smith’s 
bullying allegation yesterday. The 1,460-pupil  language college was 
ranked  ‘good’ in 2012 by Ofsted inspectors who reported that students 
told them they encountered bullying rarely and that incidents were dealt
 with well.

The incident 
comes amid mounting concern at a rise in acid attacks. Earlier this year
 it was revealed there had been 21 court cases involving such incidents 
in 2013, compared with just five in 2012.
