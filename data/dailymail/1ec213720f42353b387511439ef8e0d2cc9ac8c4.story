USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann says his son should apologise to Landon Donovan for a 'disrespectful' tweet after the star forward was dropped from the World Cup squad.

Jonathan Klinsmann, a goalkeeper selected for the country's Under-18 squad announced last month, followed Thursday's squad selection announcement by tweeting: 'HAHAHAHAHAHAH DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL MY PHONE NOTIFIED ME' followed by four emoticons with tears and another 'HAHA.' The account was quickly deleted.

Apology: Jurgen Klinsmann says his son owes Landon Donovan a huge apology for the mocking tweet

History: Donovan has an impressive record at international level, but was not in Klinsmann's squad for Brazil

'[I am] hugely disappointed. I called him right away,' the elder Klinsmann said during a news conference Friday.

'He realised just a few minutes after that what he's done. He came out of school kind of fooling around with his classmates, and they just went off on Twitter, not being aware of that he's actually followed on Twitter.'

'He has a huge admiration for Landon. He's actually a big fan of him since many, many years. He has his jersey in his room,' the coach continued.Â 

Lesson: Klinsmann said his son will learn a valuable lesson in how to use social media from the incident

'He realised what he's done, so he was devastated yesterday. And obviously as a father you put him in line and he owes him a huge, huge apology. That was highly disrespectful, and I think he got his biggest social media lesson that he could imagine.'
