Banned: Motorcyclist Michael Chester was banned from the roads for 20 months and given a suspended prison sentence

A biker has been banned from the roads after pulling a wheelie for police cameras at 110mph.

Businessman Michael Chester, 42, was ‘showing off’ as he overtook a car with his front wheel almost perpendicular with the tarmac, a court heard.

A North Yorkshire Policeman was left ‘shocked and alarm’ as he recorded Chester doing the high-speed stunt.

The father-of-two today pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on 7 July at Northallerton Magistrates’ Court.

Bench
Chairwoman Jo Senior told him: 'Riding at 110mph on one wheel is 
extremely serious and is a danger to yourself and other road users.

'Motorcyclist deaths are already too high - you could have made it one more on that day.'

Magistrates
imposed a 20month disqualification, sentenced him to 12 weeks 
imprisonment suspended for two years, ordered him to do 200 hours unpaid
work for the community and ordered him to pay £85 costs and a £80 
victim surcharge.

Mrs Senior added: 'You came very close to going to prison today. I hope you know that?'

Chester, of Holmfirth, West Yorks, rode at high speed on his Suzuki GSXR on the A63 near Sherburn-in-Elmet and pulled the wheelie for about 8 seconds.

Prosecutor Katie Varlow told the court
that at 12.15pm a North Yorkshire Police Safety Camera officer was on 
duty inside a Traffic Crime Enforcement Vehicle parked on the southbound
A63 , near Sherburn-in-Elmet when he spotted Chester’s motorbike 
travelling at high speed in the distance.

It is a long, straight road with a 70mph speed limit, the weather and visibility was good.

The road is popular with motorcyclists who tend to meet up at the well-known Squires Cafi.

Mrs
Varlow said: 'The defendant was travelling at a high speed on only the 
back wheel. The front wheel was high an almost at 90 degrees to the 
road.

'It was travelling well in excess of the speed limit and the traffic officer recorded footage.

'The defendant overtook a vehicle on the off-side still travelling on the rear wheel and his speed was recorded at 110mph.

'The defendant has then caused the motorcycle to go back on both wheels, which caused some wobbling.'

Chester pulled the wheelie for about 7-8 seconds and the traffic officer said he was ‘shocked and alarmed’ by what he saw.

Mrs
Varlow said police located Chester at the Squires Cafi and he admitted 
he had pulled the wheelie but claimed he didn’t think it was dangerous.

The court heard Chester has two children aged 11 and seven and runs a garden equipment supply company with his partner.

Mitigating David Tyrer said: 'He accepts his actions were foolish in the extreme and he accepts responsibility for that.'

Chester has been riding motorbikes for more than 20 years and had only one endorsement on his licence, said his solicitor.

'It is not a situation where Mr Chester is a habitual offender and his driving record would suggest the opposite. He has a good driving record both riding motorcycles and driving cars,' said Mr Tyrer.

'He is deeply remorseful for what he has done.'
