One hoarder turned his West Palm Beach home into a rat's nest fed by mountains of prepackaged food. 

The unidentified man's condo filled with boxes, cans, and piles of food across every square inch was found by the Hello Junk Removal company after owner Frank Buttaravoli got a call about the conditions. 

About an hour into the clean-up, the workers began to hear the sounds of the rats.

Owner will likely not be allowed to return to the home

And soon they actually saw them.

'I have not in any hoarder situation seen rats running around like children on a playground,' wroker Rafael Buttaravoli told CBS 12. 

It's still uncertain what will become of the owner.  

Food is a common obsession of hoarders

Workers discovered the rats after an hour of cleaning food

Neighbors said they could hear the rats in the property

Neighbors said the man only left to buy more food

Sadly, neighbors said it was no surprise. 

Andrea Perle said: 'I get up early in the morning, I hear them on the roof.'

And from Bob Durso: 'He goes out two or three times a day. To the Publix, or Walmart. He comes home with food.'

Instead of eating that food he was hoarding all of it. 

West Palm Beach psychiatrist Dr. Mark Agresti called it a common hoarder practice, often symptomatic of survivalists.  

'I don't think he'll be able to stay there,' Agresti said. 'He'll probably have to be moved and monitored.'
