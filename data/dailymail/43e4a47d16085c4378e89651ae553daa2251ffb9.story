Deception: Trusted office manager Sally Etchells was jailed for four years after stealing £39,000 from her employers to fund the upkeep of her seven horses

A trusted office manager who stole thousands of pounds from her employers to fund the upkeep of her seven horses, has been jailed for four years.

Sally Etchells, 45, illegally overpaid herself at least £39,000 from the payroll of the small family firm where she had worked for 25 years.

When she was found out the shameless thief, who was friends with the company's boss, refused to go quietly and instead tried to smear her former employers.

Etchells - who was director of the Arab Horse Society and the respected boss of an equine charity - sent poison pen letters to suppliers falsely telling them the firm was in debt and would not be able to make payments they owed.

Her actions nearly sunk a £500,000 corporate deal and almost caused the closure of Ken Rosebury Limited based in Rochdale, Greater Manchester - a vehicle bodybulding company which employs over 30 people. Etchells had worked at the firm for 25 years.

At Bolton Crown Court, Etchells of Royton, near Oldham - who was chairwoman of the British Amateur Home Produced Arabian Championships - was found guilty of two counts of fraud after a trial.

After the case Andrew Rosebury, 52, managing director of the firm, said: 'She was a family friend and had worked for us for so long, so it feels like a personal betrayal. Her behaviour nearly sent the company out of business.

'After the thefts came to light she wrote to many of our customers and suppliers saying that we were out of business. One firm she contacted was National Blood Service who were about to sign a contract worth £500,000 with us. That definitely would have sent us out of business. We couldn't have come back from losing that deal.

'My wife Jill was the one who spotted the thefts and we are certain that £39,000 was the tip of the iceberg. We could only afford to check the last two and a half years of our finances. Who knows how much she stole before then. Her behaviour was sickening.'

Mr Rosebury said the small family company - that his father Ken set up in 1972 - recently had to go down to three-day weeks because of a reduction in money coming into the business.

'She [Etchells] would always tell the staff that there was nothing to worry about and things would pick up. The lads on the shop floor feel betrayed,' he said.

Mr Rosebury said he does not expect the company, which employs 20 workers, to be able to recoup any of the lost cash. He said: 'I still feel very angry about what happened but I'm happy with the jail sentence. I think she got so long because of the letters she wrote. My dad is gutted. We all thought we knew her so well. This whole thing has been a nightmare.'

Mr Rosebury's wife Jill said Etchells kept between seven and 10 Arab horses at stables near her home in Royton, near Oldham, and used to tend to them every day, both before and after work.

She was also a director of the national Arab Horse Society, helping organise the annual show in Marlborough: 'I knew Sally very well and that is what makes the situation worse,' said Mrs Rosebury.

'The only reason it came to light was because she was on a day off and I was looking at the payroll system. At first I found the £25 and then other small payments. But the further I looked back I even found one payment of £5,000.

'She said at first that she was the victim but the police found a long trail of evidence.' Greater Manchester Police said Etchells was in charge of the payroll and had been responsible for paying wages to staff and herself. She was also responsible for payment of bills and outside payments to associated companies.

When Etchells was confronted, she admitted the money had been paid to the account of a woman that looked after her seven horses. Further investigation revealed that between April 2008 and November 2010, she had overpaid herself by more than £25,000 into her own accounts, including paying more than £1,800 directly into the account of the woman that stabled her horses.

It emerged she had taken a further £14,000 from the company, which had been paid into her own account over a three-year period. This was disguised as payments to other companies and the inland revenue.

Etchells was asked to leave the firm but before she went, she wiped the payroll system to try and erase any trace of the thefts she had committed, risking non-payment to other employees. Bosses then found out about the poisonous letters she sent to their suppliers. Etchells also sent a letter to her former manager making threats about the company.

Det Con Mark Zebrowski from Greater Manchester Police said Etchells had taken advantage of her position to steal money from her employers 'and lead an affluent lifestyle throughout this period.'

'She took large amounts of money from the firm, while at the time the work force was on a three-day week fighting to keep their jobs,' he said. 'Etchells has now been jailed for her crimes and I hope her former employers can take some solace in seeing her behind bars for the ordeal she has put them through.'
