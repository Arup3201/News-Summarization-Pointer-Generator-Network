Simon was spotted just hours after Lauren gave birth catching some fresh air outside of the hospital.

The television personality looked in high spirits as he wore a trench coat, blue jeans, and leather boots.

The X Factor judge previously said of his
 father Eric, who passed away in 1999 of a heart attack at the age of 
81, 'My dad was a brilliant mentor.’

Eric Selig Phillip Cowell worked in the music industry as an executive, paving the way for Simon's own illustrious career.

In 2011 Simon spoke about the devastating impact of his father's death, admitting it was the worst day of his life.

Speaking to Piers Morgan on his Tonight Show on CNN, the mogul spoke in detail about the day 12 years ago that Eric died.

The former EMI executive succumbed to a heart attack in 1999 aged 81, while he was at home with Cowell's mother Julie.

'I can't lie, it was the worst day of my life,' Cowell said, 'a horrible horrible time.'

He
 also credited his father with giving him a unique ability to use his 
charms to be able to reach out and connect with anybody regardless of 
their background.

'He said 
to me - because he was successful, my dad, when he ran his company - he 
said, 'everybody around you has an invisible sign on their head which 
says 'make me important', Cowell revealed.

'What
 I understood from that is that you've got to recognise that everyone 
around you wants to be recognised, wants to be appreciated.

'What
 I try and remember is that when I make a show, everyone has played a 
part in it. The show is created, truthfully, by 500 people every week.'

There'll be no more of that: Simon Cowell steps out of his car in a puff of smoke as he arrives for the birth of his baby son today in New York

Earlier that afternoon, the music mogul was pictured taking one 
final drag on his cigarette as he arrived in New York City with a huge 
grin on his face while preparing for the imminent arrival of his baby 
son.

The X Factor supremo, who had 
pledged to give up smoking ahead of his son's arrival, flew into New 
York on Friday after Lauren went into labour two 
weeks early.

He took the 
first commercial flight from London available on Friday morning and by 
early afternoon was at Lauren's side at Lenox Hill Hospital.

Speaking to photographers outside the 
hospital, the music millionaire, who missed the last day of taping 
auditions for his show Britain's Got Talent, said his baby was due 'any 
second now' and that Lauren is 'doing great'.

Perhaps
 to quell his nerves, Cowell took a puff on one of his favourite menthol
 Kool cigarettes before heading into the hospital. It remains to be seen
 whether he will exchange a Kool for a cigar to celebrate the baby's 
birth.

With a baby on the way, Cowell had declared that he was quitting smoking, but in November he admitted 'I lied.'

Claiming electronic cigarettes "don't work,"  the mogul said: 'There are a lot of boring things that happen when you have a baby

'You have to get rid of] sharp edges, 
cigarettes, alcohol … then there's [baby-proofing] the toilet. But I'll 
have a smoking room!'

Lauren, 37, said she wanted to have the 
baby at home in Manhattan, where her mother could help out and so she 
could be near her eldest son Adam. 

Her mother Carole Sandland is thought to be traveling from her home in Florida  to be on hand when the newborn arrives.

Once their bundle of
 joy is ready to leave hospital, the couple will bring him home to the 
$26-000-a-month apartment they are renting in Manhattan.

The
 news has come as surprise to Simon as Lauren was due to give birth on 
February 28 in one of Manhattan's most exclusive hospitals.

The hospital is where Beyoncé gave birth to Blue Ivy in January 2012 and reportedly hired out an entire floor.

Affluent mothers can pay up to $1,700-a-night for private full-service rooms where there is one nurse to every mother and baby.

Earlier this week Cowell said: 'I am 
keeping my phone on during auditions 100 per cent. If it happens I have 
to go and dash on a plane.

Missing out: Simon will not be attending Britain's Got Talent auditions on Friday due to flying to New York

Glowing: Simon attended Lauren's baby shower back in December of last year

'I probably will be nervous when it all happens. I am going to watch (movie) Father of the Bride tonight to get used to that. I have got a feeling my child is going to be really naughty.'

Cowell is currently overseeing BGT auditions in London's Hammersmith with fellow judges Amanda Holden, comedian David Walliams and singer Alesha Dixon.

The Britain's Got Talent boss revealed that expectant girlfriend Lauren has given him carte blanche to carry on with his hectic workload after the baby arrives.

Doting: Simon had kept a plane on standby so he could get to Lauren in Manhattan as quickly as possible

A squeamish Cowell revealed this week: 'I haven't changed a nappy before and I won't. I just can't do it. I'd like to be at the birth but a little but far away.'

The pop supremo, who notoriously doesn't wake before midday, maintains Lauren is understanding of his workload and has vowed not to make demands of him.

'Lauren knows what my work schedule is like and everything else so she's cool with that.'

Last month the MailOnline revealed that Simon and Lauren had decided to call their son Simon Cowell Junior  However, today, a close source said: 'They're 50/50 right now, so we have to wait and see.'

Although many thought Cowell was joking when he said that Simon was his favourite name, a friend of the couple said: ‘Simon and Lauren have decided that their favorite name for the baby is actually Simon.'

‘For a while it was between Simon and Eric- Simon’s dad’s name, but now it looks like Eric will be the middle name.’

Blooming: A heavily pregnant Silverman was last seen with 54-year-old Cowell on January 9 in St Barts

Indeed, at Lauren’s baby shower, guests brought baby gifts emblazoned with the name Simon on them. Including gifts embroidered with the initials SC.

Meanwhile Ladbrokes have released the odds for the name of the baby and they make it just a 2/1 shot that his son is called Eric after his late father.

Simon Junior is next in the betting at 4/1 or it's a 6/1 shot Harry or George get the nod, but it seems highly unlikely that Louis, Gary or Piers will be the chosen name at 33/1.

The odds also suggest that Andrew is out of the running at 100/1 considering it's the name of Lauren's ex-husband.

News of Lauren's pregnancy broke in July 
of last year- while the New York socialite was still married to 
ex-husband Andrew Silverman.
