A photographer has taken a seagull's-eye view of sea vessels.

Laurent Maes' fascinating series shows yachts, cruise liners and cargo ships in high definition.

The images range from rusty freight ships to pristine luxury yachts - one complete with a lone blonde lady perched on the front.

The very high definition of the source pictures allows them to be printed at sizes up to 10 feet, but Laurent is keeping his technique a secret.

Also an 
architect, the Belgium photographer says his work is a study of form and
 detail, rather than being a nautical work.

He also believes the scale 
of vessels show off both man's ingenuity and our small relative scale in
 comparison.

Mr Maes, who began the project in 2012, explains: 'For all of us, the sea is synonym of travelling and adventures.

'The
 sea is so attractive but also dangerous, all the ships that sail in 
this immensity are the witnesses of the human genius, those incredible 
machines are so big compared with the sailors and passengers that they 
appear a bit terrible, but also defenders.

'I
 wanted to represent ships as graphic objects: their forms and colours 
are amazing.'

Mr Maes says that aerial views of this type have been done before, but never 
with this level of precision.

'I
 don't communicate about the process. For me, the most important is the 
result. It's like a magic trick, it's more funny when you don't reveal 
how it works. If it's well done, the viewers have to feel it's easy to 
do.'

'The
 high resolution of pictures transforms the process of vision that 
becomes more analytic, abstract with a constant dialogue between details
 and general forms. The viewer focuses in on the details of each ship 
which reveal a whole other level of repeating shapes and patterns.

'The moving environment is also changing constantly, because of the wind and the power of the engine's thrust that creates waves, because of the sun or the shadows,' he said

Mr Maes says ''The sea offers each time a new face, it swifts between blues and greens, it's a pleasing palette and the waves produced by the ships are also an important graphic element'

'The
 distance with the subject creates the sensation that the 'world below' 
is more quiet and peaceful while the level of definition creates a 
proximity.

'The conjunction of all those elements makes each picture unique and results in 'SHIPSHAPE' photo series.'
