It was probably the last thing  the people of Hebden Bridge wanted to hear.

They were cleaning up again after the third devastating flood in as many weeks when climate advisers announced that things will only get worse.

Torrential rain has led to unprecedented flooding in the West Yorkshire market town where businesses have been ruined and homes evacuated three times since June 23.

Not again: The River Calder overflowed, flooding homes and businesses earlier this month

Just the start: Shops in the centre of Hebden Bridge were awash as the rainy weather began last month

Monday night brought more devastation as the River Calder burst its banks. The area is likely to get another soaking later this week.

Another week of heavy rain was yesterday predicted for many parts of the UK, triggering 35 flood warnings for today from the Environment Agency.

The April to June period in the UK has been the wettest since 1910 with more than 3,000 properties flooded across England and Wales since the start of May.

The country is bracing itself for yet
more flooding after the Met Office said the torrential downpours will 
continue into tomorrow.

Hebden Bridge saw 500 homes and businesses flooded on June 23, following a month’s rain in 24 hours, and again on July 6.

Then on Monday 1.5 inches of rain – more than two weeks’ worth – fell in three hours, overwhelming drainage systems.

The Met Office yesterday issued another severe weather alert for rain as up to 1.9 inches could fall in the South-West, South-East, Midlands and North-East.

The number of homes and businesses in England that could be at risk of flooding will quadruple in the next 20 years if no further steps are taken to prepare for a changing climate, according to the Government’s climate advisers.

More than half a million homes will be at risk of ‘significant’ flooding without more investment in defences, the Committee on Climate Change warned. 

It said building on flood plains has increased by 12 per cent in the past decade, compared to 10 per cent in other areas.

The
problem is exacerbated by people – inspired by TV makeover shows – 
putting down paving and decking in their gardens, stopping them from 
soaking up rainwater, the committee said.

Lord
Smith, chairman of the Environment Agency, believes the recent freak 
weather – drought followed by non-stop rain – is the type we should 
expect more often.

Easy does it: Hebden Bridge residents are still battling to clear up from last month's floods, which affected more than 500 homes and businesses in the area, Todmorden and Mytholmroyd

Impact: Many of the businesses in Hebden Bridge could not reopen for days and some people reported thefts of their sandbags as desperate residents struggled to keep control

Forecasters say the jet stream – a wind which sweeps across the northern hemisphere from west to east – is ‘blocked’, causing Britain to be bombarded with unsettled rainy weather.

Dr Peter Stott of the Met Office also pointed to ‘a warmer world containing more atmospheric moisture’, adding: ‘Therefore there’s the potential for heavy rainfall events to become more extreme.’

A poll by npower found half of homeowners have been using their central heating over the past month.
