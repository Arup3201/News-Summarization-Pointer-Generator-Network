The Duchess of Cambridge will use the Royal tour of New Zealand and Australia to champion the cause closest to her heart – the children’s hospice movement.

The Duchess is its most high-profile ambassador and she plans to use the tour, which starts tomorrow, to highlight the importance of palliative care for sick children.

It’s a movement that’s hardly recognised in Australia, where there are just two children’s hospices.

Sources close to Kate say her visits to Rainbow Place in Hamilton, New Zealand, and Bear Cottage in Manly, a suburb of Sydney, mark a decisive new step in her philanthropic work, as well as a touching acknowledgement of the mother-in-law she never met.

William’s mother, whose unofficial title became Diana, Queen of Hearts, dedicated much of her life to caring for sick children, a legacy that Kate has now resolved to continue.

Since her marriage to Prince William, Kate has become the public face of a growing campaign to highlight the work of hospices, and wants to use her fame to raise the international profile of care for dying children and to make hospices happier places.

The 18-day visit, which begins in Wellington, New Zealand, is the Cambridge family’s first official overseas trip together and Kate and William’s first major journey with eight-month-old Prince George.

There will be many echoes from the past when the Cambridges’ plane touches down in New Zealand at 11.45am (almost midnight in Britain). This is the country that played host to Charles and Diana when a nine-month old Prince William accompanied them on his first official tour in 1983.

In a breach of Royal protocol, sanctioned by the Queen, the Cambridges are travelling together. Heirs to the throne normally fly separately for safety reasons.

There is already huge excitement in both countries, particularly at the prospect of Prince George’s arrival.

But all eyes will be on Kate, just as they were glued to Diana during her six-week visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1983, a trip that transformed the young Princess of Wales, who had just turned 22, into an international celebrity.

Not that the Duchess is looking for the limelight. Rather, she wants to make it clear she has a serious charitable role as well as that of a wife and mother to the heirs to the throne.

According to a Royal aide, out of the 51 engagements in the next three weeks, it is the visits to two children’s hospices that are especially close to the Duchess’s heart.

The Duchess intends to share her experiences of hospices in Britain with the centres she is visiting.

She may also choose to use one of the visits to give her second overseas speech about the importance of the hospice campaign.

Kate is already patron of the East Anglia Children’s Hospices (EACH), based in Cambridge, which now works closely with Rainbow Place and Bear Cottage.

★The Duke and Duchess – minus George – are expected to spend a night of their Australian tour under canvas, ‘glamping’ in a luxury tent at a resort at the edge of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the shadow of  Ayers Rock.

★25-year-old Kate Kauri, a media-savvy reporter, will document the New Zealand tour on her iPhone and stream it live to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr  and YouTube.

★Kate has had a spray tan to ensure she looks bonzer next to the surfers. Each of her 32 outfits  has been tried on and photographed. The hems will contain tiny lead weights to prevent Marilyn Monroe-style ‘wardrobe malfunctions’.

★The 11-strong entourage includes Sir David Manning (one of the Queen’s most trusted advisers), George’s nanny, two private secretaries, four press officers, two PAs, an orderly – and Kate’s hairdresser.

★Prince George will make his first appearance on Wednesday on the lawns of Wellington’s Government House, the spot where a nine-month-old William crawled for the cameras on a visit with Charles and Diana in 1983.

★George will be taken to Sydney’s Taronga Zoo on Easter Sunday to meet Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats and other locals.

★The Cambridges  will chillax on April 23 at a trendy Adelaide recording studio. The Duke and Duchess will also get a display of skateboarding from the local yoof. Totally rad.

The Duchess will conduct the first hospice visit by herself on Saturday at Rainbow Place. She will meet children, parents and staff, and watch a play therapy session. On Good Friday, April 18, the Duchess will accompany William to Bear Cottage, which is set on the beach at Manly in Sydney. Here Kate will meet six-year-old Kaiya Miller, who suffers from cystic fibrosis. Kaiya will present the Duchess with a bunch of flowers. Kaiya said: ‘I’m most excited about meeting her. I think she’ll be nice and fun.’

One of the senior nurses, Narelle Martin, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Duchess’s visit to Bear Cottage is extremely exciting for the palliative care movement within Australia and the world. Little is known of children’s hospices in Australia and how they function.

‘The Duchess’s visit will showcase to Australia and the world that children’s hospices are happy places, filled with love, care and positive memories.’

The Duchess gave her first public speech at a hospice in 2012 when she opened The Treehouse in Ipswich, which is run by EACH.

It was there that she met eight-year-old Tilly Jennings, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, who suffers from Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare heart condition in which only half the organ functions properly.

It was day none of the Jennings will ever forget. ‘Kate did everything she could to make Tilly feel at ease,’ said Tilly’s mother, Jeanette. ‘She’s so natural with all the kids. Tilly calls her Princess Kate and that’s definitely how she seemed.’

According to Jeanette, the Duchess’s support was invaluable both on a personal and practical level.

She said: ‘Tilly can get very down, but when she met Kate she was on a high for weeks. She still talks about it now.

‘As for the hospice, the Duchess’s support has lifted our profile and in turn that has led to so many more opportunities with all sorts of different people offering help. I can’t tell you what a difference it makes.’

And according to Graham Butland, chief executive of EACH, the Duchess’s support has boosted the campaign internationally. He said that EACH is now working closely with a number of hospices around the world. ‘There can be little doubt that the Duchess is raising the awareness of the need for children’s palliative care services across the world,’ he said. ‘It has received a huge boost, nationally and internationally, since she started to champion it.’

In 2012 Kate launched the first palliative care programme in Malaysia at the Hospis Malaysia. Since the Royal visit, the country plans to open more hospices in different states and the Duchess is being closely consulted about the developments. It is a sign of the movement’s importance to her that last year the Duchess gave her first and only televised address in a video message to support Children’s Hospice Week.

Her interest dates back more than a decade, well before she married Prince William. Her parents’ business, Party Pieces, worked closely with the children’s charity Starlight and Kate found herself helping to organise parties and party bags for sick children.

While she was still plain Kate Middleton she made private visits to Naomi House, a hospice in Hampshire.

A Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duchess is going to Bear Cottage and Rainbow Place to learn about the work of palliative care teams in Australia and New Zealand. She is there to learn and discuss and to share experiences.’
