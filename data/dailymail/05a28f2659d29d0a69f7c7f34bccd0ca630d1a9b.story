Nearly 60 million Americans tuned in to the first debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney last night, as Fox News came away as the victor in cable TV ratings.Â 

Fox News ousted top competitor CNN by more than 4 million viewers in preliminary numbers released on Thursday. MSNBC came in third with 4,710,511 viewers.

Polls taken after the debate last night showed Romney to be the winner in the face of a sleepy performance by the president.

Democratic strategists are now fighting to preserve the narrow poll lead which Mr Obama enjoyed in the run-up to the debate, as fired-up Republicans aim to capitalise on the primetime thrashing and entrench the image of Mr Romney as a potential President.

As both sides of the political spectrum could agree that the clear loser in the debate was 78-year-old moderator Jim Lehrer.
