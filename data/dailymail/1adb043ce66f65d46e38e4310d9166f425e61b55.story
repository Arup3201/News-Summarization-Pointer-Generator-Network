The ex-wife of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been spotted out and about for the first time since her estimated £150million divorce from the Chelsea FC owner.

Irina Abramovich, 46, was dressed smartly in black trousers, a black leather jacket and an orange scarf as she was spotted shopping in Chelsea, south-west London, today.

The former Russian air stewardess married billionaire Abramovich in October 1991 but they divorced almost 16 years later in 2007 - in a divorce settlement said to be in the region of £150million.

Although details of the ‘quickie’ divorce in Moscow have been kept hidden under Russia’s secretive legal system, it is thought Irina was left with a lump sum as well as four homes.

She supposedly won the £18 million Fyning Hill Estate in Petersfield, West Sussex, which was Abramovich's main base in the UK as well as two of the pair’s London homes at Eaton Square and Chester Square.

The Chelsea FC owner is also said to have agreed to pay for the couple's five children; Anna, Arkady, Sonya, Arina and Ilya.

The settlement is a marked contrast to the divorce settlement with his first wife, Olga – who he married in January 1988.

She claims he left her with a two-bedroom flat in Moscow and just enough money to live on for two years when they split in 1989.

Abramovich is now said to own dozens of properties including nine flats in Lowndes Square, Kensington, which he plans to turn into a 30,000 sq. ft. house, as well as a mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens – which he bought for a reported £90million – and a home in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.

He also owns two houses in the Caribbean, a ranch in Colorado, a house just outside Moscow, and the £250million New Holland island off St Petersburg.

He also owns two planes – a Boeing 767 and 737 – three helicopters, a customised Ferrari, two Maybach limousines, a Porsche Carrera, a Rolls-Royce Corniche and a VW Golf, as well as at least three supersize yachts.

Following his two failed marriages, the Russian oligarch is now dating 32-year-old Dasha Zhukova – whose real name is Daria.

The billionaire also owns several super yachts, including 'Luna', which is pictured docked in Riva Sette Martiri overlooking St Mark's Basin between the Biennale Gardens and St Mark's Square in Venice, Italy

The Moscow-born beauty, who is editor-in-chief of bi-annual art and fashion magazine Garage, has two children with Abramovich  - Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 April 2013.

Abramovich met Dasha  - the daughter of Russian businessman Alexander Zhukova - at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father in 2006.

But apparently romance did not blossom between the two until he had split from second wife Irina in 2007.
