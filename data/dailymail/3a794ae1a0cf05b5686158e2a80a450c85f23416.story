Harlequins are set to sign Scotland winger Tim Visser, who is out of contract at the end of the season.

Edinburgh have started their search for his replacement, with the powerful Fijian-born winger Taqele Naiyaravoro being linked with a move to BT Murrayfield.

Although Edinburgh wanted to keep Visser, the Aviva Premiership outfit can offer him a more lucrative deal. They want to tie up the deal as soon as possible to fend off any other interested parties.

Harlequins are set to sign Scotland winger Tim Visser, who is out of contract at the end of the season

The Dutch-born Scottish international has spent nearly six years at Edinburgh since signing from Newcastle Falcons in the summer of 2009.

After he fulfilled his three-year-residency, he became eligible for Scotland and made his debut against Fiji in June 2012, scoring two tries.

The 27-year-old, who has scored seven tries in 17 international appearances, has topped the domestic scoring charts four out of the last five league seasons.

Reports from Australia suggest contact has been made between the SRU on behalf of Edinburgh Rugby and Naiyaravoro, the New South Wales Waratahs winger, over a possible move to Scotland.
