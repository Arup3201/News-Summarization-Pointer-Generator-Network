A British photographer has discovered what could be the world's first hunch-back alligator whilst working in the wetlands of Brazil.

Wimbledon-based snapper and travel guide Paul Goldstein was working in the Pantanal swamp region of the South American country when he stumbled upon the deformed reptile.

Lurking in the reeds, the 11ft caiman was immediately recognisable due the unusual mound on the base of its back.

Unusual: Locals in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil said they have never seen the deformed animal before

According to wildlife expert Mr Goldstein, it was also the first time that any of the Brazilian natives he works alongside had seen the caiman.

Although they are known to travel in groups, or congregations, the ugly alligator was alone.

But according to the photographer, the scaly giant was in good health and did not seem to be hampered by its hump.

Mr Goldstein said: 'I have been to the Pantanal quite a bit and never seen this, more importantly, none of the local guides had either.

One off: The hump may have been the result if an injury sustained in a fight with another caiman or birth defect

'It was on its own, but apart from being light on caiman colleagues the eleven footer seemingly did not seem worse for wear.'

It is thought the hunch may have either been the result of a historic fight injury or a birth defect.Â 

The Pantanal is a diverse wetland area and home to many species, including jaguars and caimans.

Caimans are a four-legged reptile of the alligator family and closely resemble alligators in appearance.
