A former cop-turned-disability schemer has been revealed to have been renting a $1.5million Florida mansion using the money he was given from Social Security.

Glenn Lieberman, 48, was held up by the New York District Attorney as one of the poster boys for the widespread scam when it was announced on Tuesday and now details of how he spent the $175,000 he pocketed have been revealed.

The former New York police officer and his wife moved from New York to the warmer climes of Palm Beach, Florida and are currently renting a waterfront mansion that has a pool and access to a waterway where he parks his two jet skis.

Lieberman was seen turning himself in to 
Manhattan authorities today at around 8.3am after being allowed to drive
 himself up to New York, and could spend up to 15 years behind bars for 
his part in the scheme.

Sending a message: Glenn Lieberman is pictured on a jet ski, clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing

Life of luxury: Lieberman's Palm Beach home had an on-site pool and access to water where he docked his two jet skis

The District Attorney introduced the public to Lieberman by showing a picture of the father-of-two on a jet ski sticking up both of his middle fingers while smiling at the camera.

Aside from painting an unflattering portrait of Lieberman, it also directly contradicts his claims that he suffered from 'depression and panic attacks' after working at Ground Zero following the terrorist attacks.

A former colleague told The New York Post that his illnesses weren't the only false part of his story- as they said he never even worked at the site. 

There were 102 people who were indicted as recipients in the fraudulent benefits scheme, and Lieberman is one of 82 of those people who used to work as a cop, fire fighter or corrections officer.

Some of the accused had been falsely claiming disability funds since the 1980s- with the help of four administrative ringleaders- while others only started after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Many were coached about how they could appear depressed or in the throes of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

It is not known what exactly Lieberman claimed to have, but he started collecting payments in 2009 and has since brought in a total of $175,000.

'When he told me he was a retired 
police officer and I saw how he was living, I told my husband that 
something didn’t add up,' neighbor Cheryl Weinstock told The New York 
Daily News.

Ms Weinstock 
said that she has not seen his Jeep in the Lieberman's driveway but his 
wife Mirla Sanchez's car and their dog, SoHo, are still in Palm Beach.

Not so afraid of crowds now: Joseph Morrone, who said his post-9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working, collected $108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed San Gennaro festival

Busted: Mike Scialabba (left) collected $232,443
 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot
 and Louis Hurtado (right) worked as a martial arts instructor while 
collecting $470,395 from Social Security

Active: Rich Cosentino collected a total of $207639 since May 2008 

Lieberman did work on the force for 19 years as part of the Brooklyn South Gangs officer, and it is not clear if he had picked up a secondary job since moving to Florida. If he did, that would disqualify him from receiving disability payments.

That is how a number of the other fraudsters were caught, and the District Attorney told how some were working as helicopter pilots and martial arts instructors- activities that blatantly went against their disability claims.

The officers were not the only ones in on the scheme, as The Post reports that some of the accused' siblings pulled the same move.

Vincent LaMantia is one of the 102 indicted fraudsters, and his siblings Darrin, Karen and Thomas all told officials that they had psychiatric ailments that made it impossible for them to hold down a job.

All told, the Staten Island siblings collected $596,000- with the largest portion- $287,000- going to Thomas as he began making disability claims in 2002.

Vincent, 43, collected $148,000 and the remaining $161,000 was split between Karen, Kevin and Darrin.

Many of the fraudsters left a virtual trail, including Vincent LaMantia who posted a motivational video online (which has now been removed) where he talked about ways to get rich quick.

Another such example was that of Joseph Morrone, who told authorities that his work after the September 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds.

Not hurting too badly: John Famularo, 58, lives in Nassau, New York and his alleged disabilities- which have not been specifically disclosed- should have prevented him from motorcycling but he proudly posted this to Facebook

Throwback: Famularo had no qualms about posting this old picture of him in uniform online, and he was far from the only 'boy in blue' that was involved in the scheme

On Facebook, he was pictured selling cannolis at the crowded San Gennaro festival in Little Italy.

The suspicion is that there were a handful of 'crooked' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to 'game the system'.

The four alleged 'ringleaders' were identified first, and it is clear that their positions within the NYPD and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years.

Participants would start out by contacting John Minerva, 61, a Detectives Endowment Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito, 64, a retired member of the NYPD.

Minerva or Esposito would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme- Thomas Hale, 89, and former FBI agent Raymond Lavallee, 83.

All four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny. The 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in, as ABC reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988.

The lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors- but not after some coaching.

The district attorney laid out a series of different trigger phrases that would help justify an anxiety condition prescription.

Law on their side: Raymond Lavallee, 83, was one of those two lawyers who then helped process the legal papers which allowed the schemers to get on average between $30,000 and $50,000 per year- with a nice cut for each of the ringleaders

They range from 'I nap on and off during the day' to 'my (family member) is always after me about my grooming'.

Other possible additions included the lamentation that they were 'healthy, active, productive' people but no longer.

'They're liable to say... spell the word "world," so you go "W-R-L-D." Then they're gonna say "Spell it backwards." You think about it, and you can't spell it backwards,"' court papers report that Esposito said in a recording.

All told, the fraudulent claims cost $24.5million in taxpayer-funded benefits.

'For years, federal taxpayers have unwittingly financed the lifestyles of the defendants charged today,' district attorney Cy Vance said in a statement which listed all of the 106 accused.

'Many participants cynically manufactured claims of mental illness as a result of September 11th, dishonoring the first responders who did serve their City at the expense of their own health and safety. This alleged scam further depleted the already limited resources available for battling the real and complex conditions of PTSD and depression.'
