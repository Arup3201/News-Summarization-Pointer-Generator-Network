English people looking for lower tax rates may not have to seek out an offshore haven in future - they could just go to Wales.

The Welsh government is set to be given the powers to reduce taxes in an attempt to attract businesses and individuals to the country from other parts of the UK.

Officials hope the move will help to reduce inequality between the various regions of Britain.

Idyllic: But new efforts to attract English people to Wales are set to centre around tax cuts for high earners rather than picturesque landscapes

House prices in Wales are around two thirds of the UK average, which could tempt English homeowners forced to devote most of their salary to mortgage repayments.

And experts have recommended that the Welsh Assembly should be given the power to make Wales more business-friendly by varying tax rates in the country.

Currently the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland have no tax-raising powers, but the Scottish Parliament will be allowed to set its own rates from 2016.

The Silk Commission which issued a report on the future of Wales last year suggested that the Welsh Assembly should follow suit.

Senior Conservatives are in favour of allowing the Assembly to set its own rates of income tax and stamp duty, according to the Independent.

Policy: Andrew Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, is calling for a cut in taxes

The party's leader in Wales will today unveil a new policy which would see a tax cut for those earning more than £34,000 who are currently subject to the 40 per cent rate.

Andrew Davies said: 'If some elements of income tax are devolved, it would be necessary to look at a period of reduced taxation for those paying the 40 per cent tax rate.

'This would not only send out a strong sign to business in competing regions of the UK, but it would spell out that Wales is well and truly open for business.'

Some 64 per cent of residents in Wales would support the devolution of income tax, according to a poll conducted for the Silk Commission.

Capital: Welsh politicians hope that their new tax powers would attract people to Cardiff and other cities

Currently just seven per cent of Welsh taxpayers are subject to the 40 per cent rate - 1 in 16 - compared to 1 in 10 in England.

The British Government spends more than £6,000 on Wales per head of population, meaning that Westminster is keen to reduce the country's dependency on more economically vibrant areas like London and South-East England.

As well as making Wales a more attractive place to live and do business, giving the Assembly the power to determine tax rates would boost interest in the devolved government.

The new powers would allow local politicians to run for office promising to cut taxes or offer more public services.
