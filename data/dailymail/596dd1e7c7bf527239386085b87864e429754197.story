Harry Pattison, pictured was given a suspended sentence after attacking double-amputee Tom Lawlor

A jilted husband was spared jail after he punched double-amputee war hero he caught in bed with his estranged wife.

Florist Harry Pattison, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, snapped when he found Afghanistan veteran Tom Lawlor enjoying a one-night stand with his wife Gemma Woodcock five weeks after they split up. 

After sneaking into his former home by the back door, the court heard he punched Mr Lawlor in the head as the pair lay on the marital bed.

Pattison was given a three month jail sentence, suspended for a year, a three month curfew, 24-month restraining order and a £1,156 legal bill.

This included £85 in court costs, an £80 surcharge - as well as £691 compensation to the landlord for the criminal damage, £100 compensation to Ms Woodcock and £200 to Mr Lawlor.

Scarborough Magistrates Court heard the couple had been together for five years but married only a year before Ms Woodcock threw him out.

Nick Tubbs, defending, said Mrs Woodcock, who became the sole tenant of the house after the split, was now moving out.

He said: 'Part of the problem with this case was although he had moved out of the marital home he has moved to the family home only a few yards down the street.

'He has enormous regret at what's happened. He has learned a very valuable lesson and is unlikely to be before you again.'  

Mr Lawlor was fitted with two prosthetic leg limbs after being blown up in Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device five years ago when he was a private in the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. 

The former infantry private, 24, met Ms Woodcock back in his home town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, the same evening as the attack took place.

The 26-year-old waitress was on a boozy night out with pals and invited Mr Lawlor back to her place.

They both headed up to her loft attic room, leaving his prosthetic limbs downstairs.

Prosecutor Kathryn Reeve said Pattison, 28, had also been out drinking with friends when he called his estranged wife asking to see their dog.

The back door had been left unlocked and about 4.30am Pattison let himself in.

Ms Woodcock heard the door go and jumped out of bed naked.

Miss Reeve added: 'She came across the defendant at the bottom of the stairs.

'He was very upset she has got another male at the address only a few weeks after splitting up after a long-term relationship.

'Pattison found Mr Lawlor in bed and started punching him, as the ex-soldier yelled he had left his legs down stairs.

'He has prosthetics having lost both his legs while serving as a soldier in Afghanistan,' 

Miss Reeve added.'Gemma jumped on top of the defendant and tried to intervene to defend Mr Lawlor. 

'She was pushed and dragged about and pushed downstairs.'

After smashing the mirror in the bedroom, the disturbance continued in the downstairs where Pattison smashed up a fish tank, flooding the living room.

Pattison then  ran away when Miss Woodcock called police. Mr Lawlor did not suffer any serious injuries.  

Pattison admitted two offences of assault by beating and one of criminal damage last month.

Presiding magistrates Carl Harwood said: 'This was a serious incident of domestic violence. Mr Lawlor was clearly unable to defend himself.

'The incident occurred when you entered the victim's home address uninvited in the early hours of the morning.'
