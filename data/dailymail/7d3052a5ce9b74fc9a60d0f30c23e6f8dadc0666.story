The 101st edition of the race may belong to Nibali, but the stage belonged to Navardauskas for a first Lithuanian win in the Tour.

The day's five-man breakaway of Cyril Gautier (Europcar), Martin Elmiger (IAM Cycling), Arnaud Gerard (Bretagne-Seche Environnemen), Tom-Jelte Slagter (Garmin-Sharp) and Rein Taaramae (Cofidis) were always on a short lead as the peloton kept the escapees' advantage hovering around two minutes.

With 32km to go, Slagter accelerated away from his fellow fugitives and he was out on his own 10km later as the bunch absorbed the other escapees.

The peloton reduced the deficit with every revolution despite the wet roads.

Slagter
 had a slender 15-second advantage at the foot of the day's only 
categorised climb, the category four Cote de Monbazillac.

The
 1.3km ascent might have ended some of the sprinters' chances and Marcel
 Kittel (Giant-Shimano), winner of three of the race's first four 
stages, dropped out of contention.

Slagter
 crested the summit first, ahead of team-mate Navardauskas, who then 
forged on himself on the descent in a bid to hold off the charging 
peloton.

The Lithuanian - 
with watching Garmin-Sharp team-mate David Millar writing on Twitter: 
'If anyone can do this Ramunus can!' - built a lead of 24 seconds with 
7km to go in a technical finale made more difficult by the conditions.

Garmin-Sharp loaded the front of the bunch in a bid to slow the peloton and help their team-mate's bid.

A
 large crash inside 3km to go split the peloton and ended points 
classification leader Peter Sagan's bid for a first stage success of the
 race.

The dissolving group helped Navardauskas as he was able to finish seven seconds ahead of Degenkolb.

As the crash took place in the final 3km, all the riders involved finished on the same time as Degenkolb.

Millar
 was upset after being initially selected before later omitted from 
Garmin-Sharp's Tour team, but was thrilled with the win.

The Scot added on Twitter: 'Amazing. Ramunus aka Honey Badger was my replacement. Job well done. Legend.

'The
 was an amazing performance by the whole of @Ride-Argyle. That was text 
book, even if it did look a bit mad for a while there. WOW.'
