At least 35 Disney World employees have been arrested since 2006 over alleged child sex offences, an investigation has revealed.

The suspects included a ticket seller, a concierge and a trainee tour guide at the Florida resort - and even a night shift manager accused of watching child porn at work while he wrote a church sermon.

Police caught many in stings modelled on the TV show To Catch a Predator, with undercover officers receiving explicit messages before the suspects agreed to meet at a home rigged with cameras.

Trapped: At least 35 Disney World employees have been arrested over child sex offences, an investigation has revealed. Pictured: 40-year-old Allen Treaster, a Disney concierge accused of trying to meet a 14-year-old boy

Caught: Treaster at the police 'sting house'. He was arrested two weeks ago and faces five child sex charges

The latest round of arrests last week netted another 13 suspects, including four who at some point worked at the sprawling Magic Kingdom.

Disney has insisted the theme park is so large, with around 70,000 employees, that those arrested represent only 0.01 per cent of people it has employed since 2006.

But Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said paedophiles have obvious reasons for wanting to work at the resort and wants compulsory 'lie detector' polygraph tests for staff to be made legal.

The toll of Disney workers arrested was revealed after a six-month investigation by CNN's Kyra Phillips and Scott Zamost.

They tracked down many of the suspects still facing trial including 50-year-old Robert Kingsolver, who was employed as a ride repair worker by Disney when he was arrested in February.

Toll: Arrested earlier this year were Walt Disney World employees Robert Kingsolver 
(left), 49, and Joel Torres (right), 32. Both were lured to a house by detectives thinking they would meet a child for sex, police said

Interview: A tearful Kingsolver told CNN he was not guilty and said his family knew he was not a predator

He faces two charges of soliciting a child to commit a sex act after Lake County police say he tried to meet up with a 14-year-old girl.

Kingsolver - who has pleaded not guilty - told CNN he was trying to protect the girl from further harm, was not a predator and loved working at the resort.

'To see the look on the childrens' faces when they get to see Prince Charming or run in to Mickey, that was the best part, to see kids glow, seeing their heroes,' he said.

'They know how much I love them, all four of my kids, and they know their dad is not somebody who would go out and hurt a young child.'

Many more of those tracked down, however, were reluctant to appear on camera.

One of those arrested in Polk County Police's latest crackdown was 26-year-old Zachary Spencer, a ticket supervisor at the Magic Kingdom.

'Spencer initiated contact with an 
undercover detective via a social networking site', police said in a statement last week.

Arrested: One of those from Universal Studios caught in the latest sting was 23-year-old Matthew Cody Myers - who told detectives he had also previously worked in food service at Disney, and at Sea World

'The undercover 
detective told Spencer he was a 13-year-old boy. Spencer initiate 
sexually explicit messages to a person he thought was a 13-year-old boy,
 including mutual oral sex.

'The suspect travelled to the undercover location and was arrested.'

He faces five separate charges, as does 40-year-old Allen Treaster, who worked as a concierge at Disney's Animal Kingdom.

Police arrested Treaster two weeks ago on suspicion of sending explicit messages to an officer he thought was a 14-year-old boy.

'He admitted to chatting about performing oral sex on the "boy." Treaster said that it has always been a fantasy of his to have 
sex with a 14 year old boy'

'He admitted to deputies that he travelled to
 meet a 14-year-old boy to see where things would lead to and was hoping
 for sex,' police said.

'He admitted to chatting about performing oral sex on the "boy." Treaster said that it has always been a fantasy of his to have 
sex with a 14 year old boy.'

Police are also investigating an alleged confession by Treaster that he previously had sex with a 15-year-old boy in a Georgia motel.

The CNN investigation found far more 
child sex arrests at Disney than at Universal Studios, which had five, 
or SeaWorld, which had two.

One
 of those from Universal caught in the latest sting was 23-year-old 
Matthew Cody Myers - who told detectives he had previously worked in 
food service at Disney, and at Sea World.

'Myers
 engaged in an online conversation with an undercover detective who 
identified herself as a 14-year-old girl', police said.

'He admitted to detectives that he solicited 
the conversation about sex and came to the residence with the mindset to
 have unprotected sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl.'

Another arrest was of 32-year-old Patrick Holgerson, a Disney employee accused of sending explicit photos to someone he thought was a 13-year-old boy and 
his uncle.

Bait: Police in Lake County released videos of a previous sting in February. They defend their aggressive tactics

And 20-year-old Timothy Lucas, arrested two weeks ago, was accused of sending a photo of his penis to a detective he thought was a 13-year-old girl.

Lucas told officers Disney had fired him two weeks before his arrest for missing work.

Last month a former Disney employee was sentenced to six years' jail after sheriffs accused him of watching child porn at work - while writing an Easter sermon for the church where he was a pastor.

Cedric Eugene Cuthbert, 50, was fired by Disney after his crimes were exposed.

Ruthless: Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd wants compulsory lie detector tests made legal

In all, the 35 Disney suspects since 
2006 named by CNN are charges with various offences ranging mostly from 
child pornography and soliciting sex to sexual activity.

CNN said of all 42 theme park workers 
it examined, 32 had been convicted, eight had pleaded not guilty and two
 had not yet entered pleas.

The age of consent in Florida is 18.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd has dismissed claims that his aggressive stings amount to entrapment.

He wants to be able to give compulsory
 'lie detector' tests to anyone who works around children - including in a church or a nursery - to check they 
are not a paedophile.

'Why
 do people work at Disney?' he told CNN.

'Well, they work at Disney because they want a
 good, stable job for a great company, but there is always a few that 
are there because they can see children. They can live in a child's 
world.'

However, there are concerns around the use of polygraph machines to see if someone is telling the truth - both from civil liberties groups and experts who doubt their accuracy.

Disney, Universal Studios and Sea World all said they had the highest standard of background checks and took all allegations seriously.

Disney spokesman Jacquee Wahler told CNN in a statement: 'Providing a safe environment for 
children and families is a responsibility we take very seriously.

'We 
have extensive measures in place, including pre-employment and ongoing 
criminal background checks and computer monitoring and firewalls.

'The
 numbers reported by CNN represent one one-hundredth of one percent of 
the 300,000 people we have employed during this time period.

'We continue
 to work closely with law enforcement and organizations like the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as we constantly 
strengthen our efforts.'
