Not interested: John F. Kennedy was indifferent to space travel - until he realised he could use it for political gain

Despite rousing speeches in the early Sixties about his determination to put a man on the moon, U.S. President John F Kennedy was initially very hesitant about space travel.

Correspondence between the newly inaugurated JFK and vice-president Lyndon Johnson in 1961 show that the reason behind the space programme was a chance at political victory over the Soviet Union – not exploring the universe.

During a 1962 meeting with NASA, the 45-year-old president said that he was ‘not that interested in space'.

Space exploration was John F. Kennedy’s weakest area during his first few months in office, according to Hugh Sidey, Life magazine's White House correspondent.

It was the area he was least confident with and records show the young president did not take much interest in educating himself about space, prioritising other matters.

His own science adviser said that Mr Kennedy simply ‘hasn’t thought much about it’.

Mr Kennedy’s indifference to space stretched back to his days as a Massachusetts senator in the Fifties, according to the biography John F. Kennedy: History, Memory, Legacy.

During a dinner with Charles Draper, an MIT professor and aerospace pioneer, JFK and his brother Robert F Kennedy ‘ridiculed’ Professor Draper’s pitch about space travel, and ‘could not be convinced that all rockets were not a waste of money and space navigation even worse’.

However, when the Soviet Union sent the first man into space in 1961, a mere three months after Kennedy had been sworn in as president, the president began to see the political benefits of exploring space.

In the wake of the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy was in need of a political victory, both to show the strength of his government and to demonstrate superiority over the Soviet Union.

The answer, it seems, was to beat Soviet in the race to space. As cosmonaut Yuri Gargarin - the first human in space - returned to Earth in April 1961, fears began to grow in the U.S. that the Soviets were technologically more advanced.

Mr Kennedy turned to vice-president Johnson, and it becomes clear from the letter sent by the president that there was only one reason for his support of the space programme.

His letter to Mr Johnson from late spring 1961 reads: ‘Do we have a chance of beating the Soviets by putting a laboratory in space, or by a trip around the Moon, or by a rocket to land on the Moon, or by a rocket to go to the Moon and back with a man?

‘Is there any other space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win?’

Not long afterwards, on May 25, President Kennedy announced the U.S.’s new goal of landing a man on the moon in an address to Congress.

‘First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.

‘No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.’

Four months later in a speech at Rice University, Kennedy said: ‘The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space.

‘We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.’

Nearly six years after Mr Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, on July 20 1969, Apollo 11 had landed and the following day Neil Armstrong made the ‘giant leap for mankind’ and took the first steps on the Moon.
