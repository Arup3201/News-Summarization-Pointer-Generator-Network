After securing the gold medal in an Olympic race, many would avoid admitting that they cheated for fear of having their title taken away.

That was not the case for South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh who did just that.

The 24-year-old freely stated that he took an additional underwater kick at the start of his 100m breaststroke race last week but justified the move by saying that everyone does so.

Questionable kicks: South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh won the 100m breaststroke last week

Both guilty: The footage shows that both van der Burgh (left) and Australian Brenton Rickard (right) took two vertical butterfly kicks immediately after diving in the water and before taking their sanctioned horizontal breaststroke kick

'If you're not doing it, you're falling behind,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'It's not obviously- shall we say - the 
moral thing to do, but I’m not willing to sacrifice my personal 
performance and four years of hard work for someone that is willing to 
do it and get away with it.'

Victory: The 24-year-old said that while the extra kick may not necessarily be 'moral' it is what everyone does

The Australian newspaper asked the South African about the issue in depth because van der Burgh narrowly beat out their native son Christian Sprenger who came in second.

Van der Burgh came in first in lane four, then Sprenger came in second in lane six and American Brendan Hansen was in lane eight. Because of the limited view of the underwater footage that was posted by NBC Sports, van der Burgh's kick- and that of his neighbor in lane five (who came in seventh place) are shown in detail. If his world-record time is taken away because of the extra kick, Sprnger could move up to first and Hansen could earn a silver medal.

The victor defends his title, however, saying that underwater video shows that the other swimmers near van der Burgh did the same thing: they all took two quick vertical kicks immediately after diving in the water.

Participants are only technically allowed to take one quick vertical kick before going on to take a breaststroke kick (which appears more horizontal) while they are still gliding underwater from their dive.

'I think it's pretty funny of the Australians to complain because in the underwater footage if you actually look at Brenton Rickard in the lane next to me, he’s doing the exact same thing as me yet they’re turning a blind eye,' van der Burgh told the paper.

There is a complicated history over the use of the so-called dolphin kick, which is the kick officially used in butterfly, in breaststroke races and it was previously legal in the sport for an unspecified number of kicks.

Now, certain races incorporate underwater video technology in their efforts to curtail misuse, but since the Olympics is not one of those races, van der Burgh believes that there is little incentive to keep to the rules.

'I’m really for it. If they can bring it, it will better the sport. But I’m not willing to lose to someone that is doing it,’ he said.

NBC Sports reports that while the swimming governing body- FINA- will presumably leave the results as they are, there is a chance that the Olympic committee could reverse the results after reviewing the tape and van der Burgh's revelations.
