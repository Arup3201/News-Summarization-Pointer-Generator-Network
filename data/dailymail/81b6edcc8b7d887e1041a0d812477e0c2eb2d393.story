We'd just about accepted collagen marshmallows and collagen drinks but the latest food packed with the anti-ageing ingredient might just be a step too far.

Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, serves a variety of the meaty treats, which have been designed to beat wrinkles.

The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly. 

Would you eat this all in the name of younger looking skin? A Tokyo eatery serves a variety of the meaty treats, which are packed with collagen and claim to beat wrinkles

This precious protein is the basic building block of the skin, forming mesh-like bonds to hold it firm and stop it sagging.

When we are young, skin is made up of 80 per cent collagen. After the age of 25, we lose it at the rate of about one per cent a year. The result is the twin curses of wrinkles and saggy skin.

Owners of the Zenyaren restaurant in the capital Tokyo - which invented the dish - say they have become massively popular during Japan's summer heatwave.

Chefs prepare traditional skewers of chicken - known as yakitori - but then slowly freeze them in collagen blocks so they keep their freshly barbecued taste. 

Yum? Japanese skincare specialists believe by adding collagen into the diet via these bizarre meals, the effects of ageing can be slowed down but UK specialist aren't convinced

How do they work? This precious protein is the basic building block of the skin, forming mesh-like bonds to hold it firm and stop it sagging.

A standard 'two lolly' serving costs just £ 2.50. Regular Koma Izuma, 47, said: 'It is delicious especially when you are trying to keep cool on a hot day. Refreshing and nutritious at the same time - and great for your complexion.'

Japanese beauticians believe that eating collagen-rich foods keeps your skin young and wrinkle-free.

Tokyo skin expert Tatsuto Tamura explains: 'This has been popular in Japan for generations although only now is it becoming mainstream and known in the West too.

'People here seek out collagen-enriched foods such as chicken, pigs' feet or shark fin because they believe it will help their skin,' he added.

In the US, many restaurants now serve special 'wrinkle free' menus of dishes loaded with collagen.

But the craze has not, however, impressed British skin specialists, and the British Skin Foundation claims that eating collagen does not benefit the skin in any way.

Laura Casewell, editor of The Cosmetic Surgery Guide, told the Mail: 'There's a definite move towards improving the skin from the "inside out" rather than the "outside in" and stimulating our bodies to replace what has been lost.' 

So can these meaty bites beat your crows feet? UK-based plastic surgeons and dermatologist aren't convinced.

Mr Paul Banwell FRCS(Plast) from The Banwell Clinic, said: 'These collagen popsicles sound like a fun idea but unfortunately there is little scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. 

'There are a myriad of more effective aesthetic facial treatments available from skilled surgeons and doctors and I would urge the public to seek tried and trusted methods of rejuvenation.'

This isn't the first edible collagen to come onto the market. There have been various ranges of collagen-infused marshmallows and sweets that promise to 'reduce the appearance of cellulite, and firm and tone skin'. 

'I haven't seen any strong evidence that explains why eating an increased amount of collagen should improve the quantity or quality of collagen in your skin,' says founder of 111SKIN, Dr Yannis Alexandrides.

'Collagen is a type of protein, and works with keratin to provide the skin with strength, smoothness and elasticity - however, it is effectively broken down in your stomach. There's no direct pathway to send collagen to the skin.

'I would suggest a following a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regime to optimise skin health and ensure that your body can manufacture collagen naturally. 

Can these make you young too? We've previously seen collagen-infused marshmallows and sweets that promise to reduce the appearance of cellulite, and firm and tone skin'
