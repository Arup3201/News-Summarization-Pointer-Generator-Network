A man has gone missing from the Sun Princess cruise ship travelling from New Zealand to Sydney.

The ship was due to arrive in Sydney on Tuesday morning but has turned around to retrace its path off the New South Wales coast in search of the 84-year-old male passenger.

'A thorough search of Sun Princess was conducted but the passenger could not be located,' a Carnival Cruises spokesman said.

The luxury superliner, pictured passing under the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 2007, was due to dock at Sydney's White Bay terminal on Tuesday morning

After the man was reported missing, the Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in Canberra was contacted and Sun Princess will continue in search efforts until released by the RCC. 

The ship was due to dock in Sydney's White Bay following its 13-day cruise around New Zealand but will now be delayed,

The ship's next cruise will be impacted, and the company said it is contacting guests to advise them of the change.

In October last year, a 73-year-old man died after he climbed overboard off Western Australia's coast following an argument with his wife. 

The man suffered from dementia and his death was not treated as suspicious.
