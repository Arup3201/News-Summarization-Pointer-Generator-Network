England will play glamour friendlies against world champions Germany and France in the build-up to Euro 2016.

The Football Association announced on Wednesday that the Three Lions will host France on November 17 next year, and it also confirmed England will play a friendly in Germany in March 2016.

Negotiations are also under way regarding potential pre-Euro 2016 friendlies against Holland and Spain.

The FA has already announced fixtures against Italy for March next year and a fixture against the Republic of Ireland at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on June 7.

England manager Roy Hodgson said: 'It's very encouraging that our search for opposition in the international weeks has led to quality teams such as France, Spain and Germany - with Italy and the Republic of Ireland already announced for 2015.

'They will complement the important Euro qualifiers which remain the top priority and we are taking nothing for granted. However, these six potential fixtures will provide the type of test we're looking for going forward.'

The France friendly will not take place in the highly unlikely event that England are involved in a Euro 2016 play-off.

The Three Lions are six points clear at the top of Group E after four matches.
