A Swedish politician yesterday emerged as yet another secret love child of France’s former Socialist President Francois Mitterand.

Mitterand, a notorious philanderer, was infamous for keeping an entire ‘secret’ family on the taxpayers’ expense during his 14 years in office, the longest term in his country’s history.

Now it has emerged that he fathered a son, Hravn Forsne, when he was well into his 70s and towards the end of his career, which came to a halt in 1995.

Family resemblance? Mr Forsne, left, who is now running for the 
Swedish parliament for the Moderate party, confirmed that Mr Mitterand 
was his father in an interview with Stockholm journalists

Mr Forsne,
 who is now running for the Swedish parliament for the Moderate party, 
confirmed that Mr Mitterand was his father in an interview with 
Stockholm journalists.

‘I want to be judged for who I am, not who my father was,’ said Mr 
Forsne, saying that he only met his elderly ‘secret’ father ‘five or 
six’ times before his death in 1996.

Mr
 Forsne’s mother, Christina Forsne, was a Paris correspondent for a 
Swedish news agency and had a 15 year relationship with the French head 
of state between 1980 and 1995.

During this time Mr Mitterand was married to Danielle, the mother of his three sons, and also a committed Socialist first lady.

But he was also juggling his life with another mistress, Anne Pingeot, and they had a daughter, Mazarine.

Mr Mitterrand always had an unconventional love life. In 1974, when he was the unsuccessful Socialist candidate his mistress, Anne
Pingeot was pregnant by him with their daughter Mazarine.

Charles Moore's book 'François Mitterand: A womanising president who shaped Europe' delved into his unconventional marriage.

During his presidency, he lived with his wife, Danielle, and her
lover, in the rue de Bievre, whilst his mistress, Anne, lived just 10 minutes
away from them.

Shortly after
he became president in 1981, he did not live in the Élysée Palace. Instead, he
slept with Anne nightly at a residence on the quai Branly.

Years later,
it emerged that the taxpayer funded a protection squad of 36 men for this unusual
arrangement.

Even on state
visits, the former president took his mistress and not his wife along with him.

In 1987, he took
Anne and Mazarine to Egypt, and walked with them to the summit of Mount Sinai –
to prove he was in good health at 71.

The French politician had a complicated love life throughout his life, and, even made one of
his ex-lovers, Édith Cresson, prime minister.

However, Mr Mitterand was
the only president to have had his extra-marital relations confirmed after newspaper Paris-Match
obtained images of his daughter in 1994, and asked for the president's permission to
publish them.

Two years later his wife invited his mistress and daughter to attend the
president's funeral.

Mazarine, now 39, has already recounted the trauma of growing up as one of France’s most closely guarded secrets.

She said her ‘hidden childhood’ weighed so heavily on her young shoulders that she later had to have counselling.

Mazarine said she was not allowed to call her father ‘Papa’ in public and had to hide in cars when driven to and from the Elysee presidential palace.

When news of her existence became public towards the end of Mr Mitterrand’s presidency, in 1994, she said she felt she was ‘the shame of the Republic’.

When asked directly if Mr Mitterrand was indeed Hravn’s father, his mother Ms Forsne said:  ‘I’m willing to talk about my relationship with Francois Mitterrand. But I’ll not talk about anyone else who is close to me.’

French presidents of both left and right are well-known for their extramarital affairs.

Earlier this year Francois Hollande, the first Socialist to get the job since Mitterand, split from his girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler, after he was caught with a mistress, Julie Gayet, in January.

The bachelor president has never been married, but has four children with his ecology minister, Segolene Royal.
