Andrew Hewes, pictured, got a 'buzz' out of removing his trousers and underwear before driving alongside the girls, a court heard

A scuba diving instructor has been jailed after repeatedly driving past schoolgirls - while naked from the waist down.

Andrew Hewes, 51, got a ‘buzz’ out of removing his trousers and underwear before driving alongside the girls, a court heard.

He was reported by four victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, after they became aware of his car - a Rover with a large car sticker promoting a diving school.

Wakefield and Pontefract Magistrates Court heard how Hewes passed them at least four times while they were walking in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, in December last year.

After originally denying outraging public decency, Hewes was convicted following a trial, and was jailed for 24 weeks.

Dan Smith, mitigating, said his client had no relevant previous convictions, had been married for 32 years and had worked in the Navy, the Home Office and as an engineer. He was also a volunteer diving instructor.

Mr Smith said: “His sense of guilt is overwhelming. He knew he was in the wrong.

'He knew there was a possibility he could be seen.

'He is sorry to the girls. Perhaps they can take some confidence from the point he has accepted his responsibility.

'He now has to face his family, friends and employer and the stigma of the offence.'

District Judge Adrian Lower, referring to Hewes’ interview with a probation officer, said: 'You decided to stop, pull down your underwear and trousers and got back in your car and drove further.

'You described to the probation officer how this gave you a buzz.

'There was clearly an element of planning in what you did. The office has obvious sexual overtones and motivation behind it.'

The judge said: 'The four girls who saw what you did in December last year had to relive that experience by giving evidence at trial.

“The punishment is going to be greater than if you had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.'

He said he had a duty to protect the public and to send out a strong message by a fitting punishment of custody.

Mr Lower added: 'I can’t suspend it. It was a serious matter involving four members of the public of school age. There was repetition and planning.'

After sentence Mr Smith lodged a notice of appeal against sentence but Judge Lewer said Hewes would remain in custody pending an appeal at Leeds Crown Court.
