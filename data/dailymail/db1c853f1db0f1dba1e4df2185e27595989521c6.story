Winners: Graham Nield, 55, and Amanda Vickers, 48, celebrate winning £6,676,215 last year

When Graham and Amanda Nield won £6.6million on the lottery, they could have bought fancy cars or wardrobes full of designer clothes.

But the couple simply can’t shake their thrifty ways and call being rich ‘a headache’.

They still buy their clothes from markets and charity shops – a £6 skirt and £2 jumper are recent bargains – and scour car boot sales.

And they’ll stick to their usual £50 limit on Christmas gifts. Mr Nield is giving his wife four new tyres on her car, saying: ‘I got them at a discount.’

Mrs Nield, 48, said: ‘I can’t change my habits. My friend took me to Harvey Nichols in Leeds and I nearly passed out at the prices.’

Her recent purchases have included 
buying herself a new skirt - costing £6 from the local market - and 
jumpers for her husband from the same place are usually priced £2.

While
he bought her a £3 pair of second hand shoes from a charity shop, 
although they had caught his eye because they were the same style as the
ones she wore on their first date.

The divorcees have five children between them from previous relationships and 13 grandchildren.

They
lived together in Batley, West Yorkshire, for years and Mr Nield, 56, 
finally plucked up the courage to propose shortly after hitting the 
jackpot last August.

With their newly-won riches the couple could have chosen an exotic location anywhere in the world to tie the knot, but true to form they went for the simple option.

The Register Office ceremony took place at Dewsbury Town Hall and was attended only by immediate family.

Mrs Nield even saved money by wearing a dress borrowed from a friend and Mr Nield wore a suit several years old.

They now have the money to buy a fleet of cars, but she drives a two-year-old Hyundai and he has a five-year-old Kia.

Mr Nield said: ‘People keep asking me if I am going to get a Ferrari or a Lamborghini, but what would be the point. We just want to be comfortable, we are so used to living within our means.’

Spend: They refuse to splurge on Christmas presents or their wedding, preferring their normal lifestyle

Commenting on becoming multi-millionaires, he added; ‘It is a headache. The money generates a whole new avenue of problems. We have a solicitor and a financial advisor and we have regular meetings but at the moment it is just sitting in the bank.’

The couple previously had a joint income of around £50,000, but could only afford to rent their home. That has now changed and the one exception to their refusal to splash the cash on themselves has been in buying a house.

They are having a three-bedroom bungalow built for them to live with Mrs Nield’s parents. Her 72-year-old father James is in the late stages of Alzheimer’s Disease after suffering from it for a decade and her mother Joan is recovering from cancer and has severe arthritis.

They hope one day to start a business, but the win has enabled Mrs Nield and her husband to quit their jobs to become carers.

‘Amanda is determined to look after her parents herself and the easiest way to support her in doing that is to move in with them,’ he said.

The couple have also fulfilled an ambition to buy each of their children a house as well.

However, with Christmas approaching they haven’t changed their customary budget for presents of £50 per person in the family.

And Mr Nield doesn’t have to worry about what to get his wife because he’s already spent money on her.

‘I have put four new tyres on Amanda’s car,’ he said. ‘I got them at a discount.’
