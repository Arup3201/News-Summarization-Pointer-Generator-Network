A homeless man was crushed to death by a large metal-clawed crane at a recycling plant after he fell asleep in a wheelie bin, an inquest has heard.

Mark Bradshaw, who was a night supervisor at Biffa Recycling plant in Tipton, West Midlands, knew something was wrong when he heard a sickening ‘thud’.

He then discovered 
the body of Ranjit Singh, 48, among a pile of rubbish when it was lifted
 onto a conveyor belt.

The homeless man was last seen the night before he died on September 7 outside a bookmakers in Smethwick, West Midlands.

Speaking at the inquest, Detective Constable Aki Heer from West Midlands Police, said: 'A post-mortem found he had sustained catastrophic crushing injuries including a broken spine and shattered pelvis and that the injuries were consistent with the large claw machinery found at recycling sites.'

Mr Singh was well known among the homeless community and the inquest heard he often slept in bins behind shops.

He also had twice the legal drink drive limit of alcohol in his blood when he died and had a history of alcohol abuse.

Health
 and Safety inspector Judith Lloyd said the Biffa Recycling site 
processed around 700 tons of rubbish a day and at the time of Mr Singh’s
 death the bay had been dealing with around 200 tons of recyclables.

She said: 'Biffa have a number of systems in place to help drivers deal with people in and around bins.'

A jury concluded Mr Singh’s death was an accident and he had received multiple injuries after being crushed by machinery.

Verdict - Accidental death.
