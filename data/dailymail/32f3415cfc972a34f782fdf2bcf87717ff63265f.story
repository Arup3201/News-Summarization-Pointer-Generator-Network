Last night skywatchers were treated to the annual Eta Aquarid meteor shower.

But later this month we might be in store for a meteor storm that has never been seen before as Earth passes through the tail of a comet.

As our planet passes through debris from Comet 209P/LINEAR, astronomers say we could see as many as 1,000 shooting stars per hour.

On the nights of 23 and 24 May sky watchers could be in for a treat as Earth passes through the debris left by Comet 209P/LINEAR. This could provide observers in the US and Canada with up to 1,000 meteors an hour in what has been described as a 'meteor storm'

The event will occur on the nights of 23 and 24 May, when Earth’s path crosses that of the comet, and will first be most visible from the northern US and southern Canada as well as parts of Europe.

From the UK the event is not expected to be visible, although on before dawn on 24 May some meteors may still be visible.

As our planet moves into the 'blizzard' of of ice and rock chunks, they will burn up in the atmosphere, providing observers below with slow moving but bright meteors.

The reason we could see so many meteors is because all of the debris it has ejected between 1803 and 1924 will be in Earth’s path.

‘This potential new shower is so new that astronomers aren’t sure what to expect,’ said Jane Houston of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

‘Predictions run from less than 100 meteors per hour up to an unlikely but possible meteor storm as high as 1,000 per hour.’

The comet was first spotted back in February 2004, but this is the first chance encounter between it and Earth.

The discovery was made by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project.

It
 completes an orbit of the Sun every 5.09 years, with its orbit ranging 
from just inside that of Earth to almost as far as Jupiter.

Following
 our encounter with its tail, the comet will be as close as 5 million 
miles (8.3 million kilometres) to Earth on 29 May before it makes its 
way out towards Jupiter again on its orbit.

The meteor storm will be visible in the night sky from the northern US and southern Canada, as well as other swathes of the Northern Hemisphere (see next picture). The best views will be towards the North Star (Polaris) above Camelopardalis, with this meteor storm being dubbed Camelopardid

However, there is still a chance the event will not be as impressive as predicted.

‘The idea of a brand new meteor shower is indeed very exciting,’ astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine tells MailOnline.

‘The shower has been referred to as a "meteor storm", however, judging by recent calculations, the idea of a phenomena that will see 1,000 meteors per hour is in fact dwindling.

‘We’re more likely to see a strong shower rather than a storm of meteors.

‘However, of course, we won’t know it’s true strength until we head outside and observe the meteor shower for ourselves when 209P/LINEAR arrives.’

Amateur astronomers are advised to keep their eyes on the sky as Earth makes its way through the comet's tail later this month.

On its first night the meteor storm will be visible in the US and Canada. As Earth rotates and moves, however, parts of Europe should also be treated to a view. As the extent of the meteor storm is unknown, your best bet is to keep an eye on reports as the event draws near

This 30 April 2014 image was taken using the Nasa Marshal Space Flight Center 20" telescope located in New Mexico. Comet 209P/LINEAR (pictured in circle) was first spotted in February 2004, but this will be its first encounter with Earth. The comet completes an orbit of the sun roughly every five years
