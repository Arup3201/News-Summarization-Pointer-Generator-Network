Apple Maps has been a regular source of ridicule since it launched last year after claims it sent users onto airport runways and is missing entire towns, yet it seems the tech firm may have the last laugh.

Figures from analytics firm ComScore has found that while Google Maps has lost almost a third of its users in the past year, Apple’s own mapping service has been slowly gaining in popularity.

The rise is being attributed to the introduction of iOS 6,  which uses Apple Maps as the default navigator.

Before Apple Maps (blue line) launched in September 2012, Google's own mapping service (orange line) was used by around 78% of iPhone and Android owners in the U.S. A year later, this figure has dropped to 43% while Apple's share has slowly risen to more than half of iPhone users

Up until last year Apple’s built-in mapping tools were powered by Google Maps.  

During his keynote speech at the World 
Wide Developer Conference in June last year, ex-senior vice president of
iOS software Scott Forstall announced Apple would be switching to its 
own version of Maps.

The application was then officially released alongside the iPhone 5 in September 2012, yet was heavily criticised for being inaccurate.

Apple briefly kicked the Google Maps 
application off its store in 2009 because Google wouldn’t add 
turn-by-turn navigation tools to its iPhone app – despite the feature 
being available on the Android version.

It was later allowed back on the store, yet this is thought to have been the reason why Apple began developing its own app.

The research was carried out by The Guardian’s Charles Arthur.

He compared ComScore figures from September 2012 – the month Apple Maps launched – to the same app usage figures from September this year.

Last year, there were a total 103.6 million iPhone and Android owners and 81.1 million of them used Google Maps.

During the same month in 2013, the number of phone owners has grown to 136.7 million, yet only 58.7 million of these people still use Google’s mapping service.

This is a drop of almost 36 per cent in 12 months.

During September this year, figures from ComScore also showed that 60.1 million people in the U.S. had an iPhone, and of that number, 35 million had used Apple Maps at least once.

Apple Maps is only available on iPhones running the iOS 6 software and above.

Based on ComScore's figures, 58 per cent of the possible people who can use Apple Maps, do.

Alternatively, Google Maps is available on iPhones and Android phones, so the numbers are higher but the proportion of users is less.

The Guardian also worked out that of the 58.7 million Google Maps users in September this year, 6 million used the app on an iPhone.

Of this 6 million, around 2 million physically couldn’t use Apple Maps because they weren’t running iOS 6 - ultimately leaving Google Maps as one of the only options.

Following the launch of Apple Maps in September 2012 users complained the app sent them onto airport runways, pictured, and even into the sea

Users have complained the app has sent them onto airport runways, onto piers and even into the sea.

Google and Apple use location-based services, including Maps, to learn more about their customers.

Reports last week claimed Google is planning to use location data about its customers to track them on the high street.

Each time a user enters a store of business, Google would be able check their location and then see if that user looked at adverts for that company online beforehand.

It would do this to check advert conversion rates.

Google also serves adverts on its Maps app meaning if fewer people are using it, fewer people will see their ads.

Recent reports found Google makes around $100 million a day by selling Google Ads to businesses online.

This is despite the number of iPhone and Android users rising by 30m
