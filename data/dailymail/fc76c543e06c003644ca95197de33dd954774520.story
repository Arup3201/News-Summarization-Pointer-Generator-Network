Fans of the addictive and frustratingly difficult Flappy Bird game rejoice.

The official app is back after developer Dong Nguyen launched it on the Amazon Appstore - and it has a number of added features including multiplayer controls and new obstacles.

The free app, called Flappy Birds Family, is only currently compatible with Amazon Fire TV game controllers and remote - but it is hoped it will launch on other platforms soon.

Hanoi-based developer Dong Nguyen released Flappy Bird for Android and iOS in May 2013.

Before it was pulled, the Android version was downloaded up to 50 million times, and attracted more than half a million reviews.

It also topped the Apple download charts, although total figures were not officially released.

The game was pulled after Mr Nguyen tweeted in February: ‘I am sorry "Flappy Bird" users. I cannot take this anymore.’

In March, Mr Nguyen told Rolling Stone if the game was to return, he would include a warning to make sure players took a break.

After it was pulled, fans of the game were shelling out thousands for phones pre-loaded with the game.

Flappy Bird replica games and apps then started to appear online and on app stores. 

The game was pulled from app stores in February, after Mr Nguyen became concerned it was too addictive.

This led to Mr Nguyen receiving death threats and abuse from fans, and in March he confirmed the app would return.

True to his word, Mr Nguyen has released Flappy Birds Family on the Amazon store through his .Gears studio.

Neither Mr Nguyen, nor his studio, has confirmed if the app will launch on other platforms and MailOnline has contacted them for more information.

However, the launch of the app on Amazon Fire TV has given fans hope it will appear on Google Play and Apple’s App Store in the near future.

The original Flappy Bird was a single-player game in which users had to steer a bird through green pipes that resembled those in Nintendo’s Mario Bros franchise.

This latest version features multiplayer controls, and gamers also now have to avoid ghosts as they fly through the levels.

‘Flappy Birds now are on Amazon Fire TV with incredible new features,’ explained the app description.

‘Person vs Person mode, more obstacles, more fun and still very hard. Enjoy playing the game at home with your family and friends.’

The game was pulled after Mr Nguyen tweeted in February: ‘I am sorry "Flappy Bird" users, 22 hours from now, I will take "Flappy Bird" down. I cannot take this anymore.’

He admitted he was concerned the game was becoming too addictive, and the pressure was causing him to lose sleep.

In March, Mr Nguyen told Rolling Stone magazine that if the game was to return, he would include a warning to make sure players took a break.

The 30-year-old coded the app in days and many people believed the app was pulled due to threats from Nintendo.
