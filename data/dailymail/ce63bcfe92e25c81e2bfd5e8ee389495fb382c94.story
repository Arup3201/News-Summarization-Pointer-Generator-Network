During it's seven-year run, critics praised 30 Rock as a show on the cutting edge of comedy.

Now it appears the Emmy Award-winning show was also ahead of its time when it came to the news - airing a dark joke painting Bill Cosby as a rapist all the way back in 2009.

In a clip from season three 'The Bubble', recently unearthed by Crushable, Alec Baldwin's NBC executive character Jack Donaghy tries to get actor Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan)  to come back to work at fictional television show TGS in the middle of contract negotiations by hiring a Cosby impersonator to speak to the actor over the phone.

But the plan backfires when Jordan hears Cosby's voice, and reveals he has some bad family history with the The Cosby Show star.

Prediction? In 2009, 30 Rock aired a joke alluding to the allegations of rape against then-beloved comedian Bill Cosby. The joke involved hiring a Cosby impersonator (right) to coax an actor back to work

Under fire: The comedian used to be known as a moral pillar, an image he crafted through is many years playing an upright dad on The Cosby Show. That's changed now that at least 20 women have come forward to accuse him of rape 

'Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin’ on the phone wit’ me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette!' Jordan yells down the line. 

'I think you’re confusing me with someone else,' the baffled impersonator replies.

'1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye!' Jordan responds. 

The impersonator finds himself at a lack of words, saying: 'I’m the guy… with the pudding…'

'Don’t try to tell me what to do! Dr. Heathcliffe Huxtable, wit’ yo’ light-a** kids! Jack! Why would you make me talk to this man?' Jordan finishes. 

Not a Cosby fan: Alec Baldwin's character's plan to get Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan, right) back to work backfires when Jordan reveals an aunt's traumatizing run-in with Cosby in 1971

Jack Donaghy: I’ve arranged for one of Tracy’s childhood idols to reach out to him.

Tracy Jordan: Hello?

Jack Donaghy: Tracy, this is Jack, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.

Rick (impersonator): Tracy, this is Bill Cosby…

Liz Lemon: [whispering] Really? This is your strategy?

Jack Donaghy: [whispering and smiling] I heard him do this at a party!

Rick: …I want you to come back to the TGS for the people who like the jokes and the things.

Tracy Jordan: Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin’ on the phone wit’ me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette!

Rick: I think you’re confusing me with someone else.

Tracy Jordan: 1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye!

Rick: I’m the guy… with the pudding…

Tracy Jordan: Don’t try to tell me what to do! Dr. Heathcliffe Huxtable, wit’ yo’ light-ass kids! Jack! Why would you make me talk to this man?

In 2005, it was a dark joke that most likely went over most viewers' heads. But, it's unlikely the joke was crafted randomly. 

While accusations against Cosby go all the way back to 2004, it wasn't until this October when comedian Hannibal Buress gave a highly-public rant about the comedian which caused scores of women to go public with their stories, ruining the image Cosby forged as a morally upright dad on his television show. 

Buress himself spent time as a writer on 30 Rock, though he wasn't working for the show until after 'The Bubble' was written. However, the fact that Buress knew about the allegations, means it was likely known by others in the 30 Rock writing room.

Show creator Tina Fey is the only person given a writer's credit for the episode, with Donald Glover (who went on to act on Community and also rap under the name Childish Gambino) and Kay Cannon (Jason Sudeikis' ex-wife) serving as executive story producers.

Writer: 30 Rock creator and star Tina Fey is the only person credited with writing the episode. She grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, not far from Temple University where a school employee first called out Cosby for touching her inappropriately in 2004.

That Fey may have known about the allegations against Cosby is also unsurprising, since she grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania near Temple University. 

It was at Temple in 2004 that rape allegations against Cosby first became public, when a  former university employee Andrea Constand accused the star of fondling her. 

The case was ultimately thrown out a little over a year later, since authorities said they didn't have enough evidence to charge Cosby. 

Instead,  Constand field a civil suit in March of that year, and found 13 other women willing to testify as witnesses showing Cosby's pattern of disturbing behavior. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in November 2006.

Fey has not commented on the scandal.
