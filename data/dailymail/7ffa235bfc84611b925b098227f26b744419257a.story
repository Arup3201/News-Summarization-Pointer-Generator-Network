Two women have been tortured for three days and then beheaded in a remote village in Papua New Guinea after being accused of witchcraft.

A team of police rushed to the scene - but were forced to stand by and watch the victims being decapitated with axes as locals refused to let them come to their aid.

A large crowd kept the police at bay within sight of the clearing where the women were lying trussed up on the ground.

Villagers on the island of Bougainville ignored orders to let them go, and instead set about them with axes and knives.

Brutal: In February, a young woman was burnt alive on a pile of tyres (pictured) for allegedly killing a boy

The women, from the village of Tandorima, were accused of using sorcery to kill a popular schoolteacher who died a few weeks ago.

'We couldn't do anything to help these two women,' said Central Bougainville police chief Herman Birengka.

'My men were threatened when they went to the area to negotiate the release of the women. We were helpless. We couldn't do anything to help them because of the threats made against us.'

He said the mob had burned down houses in the women's village, forcing their relatives to flee into the jungle.

'These killings were both barbaric and senseless,' Mr Birengka said.

Sorcery
and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly 
practiced in remote villages across the island nation.

The
cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an 
evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a 
bag of rice,

In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice.

However
the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused 
of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by 
‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders.

As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law.

Last
July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism 
after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and 
use their genitals for sorcery rituals.

In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery.

The gruesome murders follow a number of 
sorcery-related killings on the Papua New Guinea mainland, mostly in 
remote highland villages.

Earlier this year a young woman accused of being a witch and causing the death of a young boy was dragged to a rubbish dump and burned alive, with police once again unable to help because of threats by the crowd.

'I wish we could have helped these two women,' said Mr Birengka in a reference to the latest killings.

'But the villagers who had kidnapped the women were armed with five high-powered firearms, knives and axes.'

He told the Post Courier newspaper that the two women were attacked at their village homes at night and taken to the nearby village of Lopele, where the mob accused them of practicing sorcery and bringing about the death of the teacher.

They were tortured for three days and nights, receiving numerous knife wounds, before being dragged out to a clearing to face execution.

Learning of the imminent murders, police desperately tried to bring in mediators, but all efforts to prevent the deaths failed.

'We did not want to resort to force as the whole situation could have turned nasty with more lives at stake,' Mr Birengka said.

'Even so, I'm disgusted with my officers for failing to find a way of stopping these people who showed utter disregard to law and justice.

'While they might well have been threatened, those police should have tried harder from the very beginning.'
