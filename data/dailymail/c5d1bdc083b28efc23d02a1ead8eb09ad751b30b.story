Team news

Arsenal 

England forward Danny Welbeck could make his Arsenal debut in the lunchtime clash against Manchester City following a £16million deadline day move from Manchester United.

Midfielder Aaron Ramsey (ankle) will be assessed while captain Mikel Arteta (ankle) is back in full training, along with goalkeeper David Ospina (thigh) and full-back Kieran Gibbs (hamstring).

German playmaker Mesut Ozil should be available after returning early from international duty because of a sprained ankle. 

England forward Theo Walcott is a couple of weeks away from returning after a serious knee injury, but midfielder Serge Gnabry (knee) remains out and striker Olivier Giroud (fractured foot) is a long-term absentee.

Provisional squad: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Arteta, Wilshere, Ramsey, Sanchez, Ozil, Welbeck, Ospina, Cazorla, Monreal, Chambers, Flamini, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanogo, Podolski, Campbell.

Manchester City

Manchester City are without midfielder Fernando (groin) and striker Stevan Jovetic (hamstring) will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Arsenal.

Defender Eliaquim Mangala, signed from Porto last month for £32million, and on-loan former England midfielder Frank Lampard are both in contention for debuts after building up their general fitness.

Captain Vincent Kompany is fit after coming through Belgium's friendly with Australia unscathed despite concerns over a calf injury.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Mangala, Nastasic, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Silva, Milner, Navas, Nasri, Toure, Fernandinho, Lampard, Aguero, Dzeko.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Arsenal won 18 of their first 22 Premier League fixtures against Manchester City, but have only won three of the last 12 (D4 L5).

The Citizens have only won one of 17 previous Premier League games away at Arsenal; a 2-0 win in January 2013 (L11 D5).

Indeed, that 2-0 win was also the only time Manchester City have scored more than once in 17 Premier League games at either Highbury or the Emirates.

Danny Welbeck could become only the third player in Premier League history to play for both Arsenal and Manchester United (Mikael Silvestre, Robin van Persie).

The Gunners have won more Premier League games in September than any other Premier League side (48) and also have the best points/game average (2.02).

Arsene Wenger’s side are unbeaten in 19 Premier League games at the Emirates Stadium (W14 D5) and have won their last four in a row there.

Arsenal have conceded four goals from only seven shots on target faced in the top-flight this term.

Manchester City have not lost two consecutive league games since October 2010 – one of the games that they lost back then was against Arsenal.

Arsenal have already gained a league-high four points from losing positions in 2014/15.

Sergio Aguero has scored eight goals in his last 10 Premier League away appearances.
