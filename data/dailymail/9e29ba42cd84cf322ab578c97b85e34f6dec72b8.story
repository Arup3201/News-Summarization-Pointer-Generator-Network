An Israeli political candidate has come under fire after dressing up as an Islamic State captive as part of a traditional Jewish festival.

Anat Roth, a member of Israel's Zionist Bayit Yehudi party, posted a picture of herself on her Facebook account dressed in orange, while kneeling on the floor with her head to the ground.

Behind her stood a woman dressed as an ISIS executioner all in black and with a knife attached to her belt.

It mirrors similar images released by ISIS, which show their captives kneeling in the sand in the desert while extremists stand behind them.

The picture came as Jews across the world celebrated the traditional festival of Purim, which is often marked with colourful costumes.

Ms Roth then captioned the picture: 'This is what we’ll get if we don’t have a big Bayit Yehudi. Happy Purim!'

The image has since been removed but according to the Jerusalem Post, the picture prompted an angry backlash on social media.

Some wrote that Ms Roth should be ashamed of herself, however, her party supporters said her costume was funny.

Ms Roth, is a former peace activist and was once an advisor to ex-Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak.

Her party, Bayit Yehudi, which means The Jewish Home, is a successor to the National Religious Party.

They firmly believe that Jewis are devinely commanded to retain control over the land of Israel.

A group of Jewish men braved the snow storms in New York to walk to the synagogue to celebrate the Jewish festival of Purim 

Meanwhile Jewish families transformed streets around the world as they dressed up as kings and queens, clown, animals and even superheroes to celebrate Purim.

The holiday commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia after a beautiful queen, Esther, foiled a royal advisor's plot to annihilate all the country's Jews in just one day.

It is traditionally marked with parades, the giving of presents, and by observers sporting a host of colourful costumes which traditionally take their cue from the Biblical story of Esther.

Celebrations marked the holy day across the globe, and even the wintry weather in New York couldn't dampen spirits as families made their way to synagogues through the snow.
