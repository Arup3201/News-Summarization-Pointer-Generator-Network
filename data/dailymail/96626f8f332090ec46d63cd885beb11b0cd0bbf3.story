No doubt there were thousands of Chileans who woke up with a sore head on Saturday morning after celebrating their country's 3-1 win over Australia the night before.

But for this group of Chile fans it must have been a particularly painful morning after falling off the back of a pick-up truck during Friday night's celebrations.

In this video released by FailsWorldTV, fans are shown celebrating Chile's World Cup win over Australia by jumping around in the back of a pick-up stuck in traffic.

Pile on: The fans fall onto the road below but amazingly all five quickly get back to their feet

However, their joy turned to pain as the truck moved forward and five fans fell backwards onto the road below.

Amazingly, all five quickly got back up with two of them chasing after the truck to jump back on.

Chile continue their World Cup campaign against Spain at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium on Wednesday night.
