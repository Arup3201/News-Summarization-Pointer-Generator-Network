England's Fran Halsall became the first woman to win gold in both the 50m butterfly and freestyle with her second gold medal in Glasgow on Sunday night.

The 24-year-old produced another record breaking performance to win the butterfly final, finishing ahead of the Bahamas' Arianna Vanderpool-Wallace with a time of 25:20secs.

It was her ninth Commonwealth Games medal in total and secured a never-before-done sprint double.

'I swam a bit faster than last night and it's another PB so I can't complain,' Halsall said.

'I couldn't feel anyone's presence during the race and it's been a good couple of days. I have a lot of faith in my coach James Gibson and I believe in him.'

Her success followed England team-mate Liam Tancock's bronze medal in the 50m backstroke.
