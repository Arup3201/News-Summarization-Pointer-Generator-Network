A heavily pregnant woman has been caught on camera hitting her baby bump with a hammer to prove how ‘hard’ her unborn child is.

Heather Thorpe, 24, was filmed by her former partner, Sean Hanlon, striking herself with the claw hammer around a month before giving birth to her son, Jonathon.

But when Mr Hanlon, 26, showed the video to police, officers refused to press charges, insisting no offence had been committed.

Yesterday Mr Hanlon said he was 
appalled at the police’s decision, adding: ‘If there was a film of 
someone hitting a baby with a hammer they would be in handcuffs in ten 
seconds flat.’

Mr Hanlon 
shot the five-second video in the couple’s living room in October last 
year, just weeks before Miss Thorpe’s due date.

He said he had been filming her on his iPhone when she told him: ‘My baby’s hard as anything – just watch this.’

He
 then began filming her as she walked over to his toolbox. The short 
clip shows Miss Thorpe lifting up her top to reveal her  baby bump.

She 
then grabs the steel claw hammer and hits the side of her stomach twice,
 apparently not caring about the harm that could be inflicted on her 
unborn infant.

He said she had also punched herself before because ‘she wanted the baby to come out’.

Mr Hanlon, a security guard from Lea Village, Birmingham, said: ‘I was completely shocked, but Heather didn’t seem to care.

‘I asked her what the hell she was doing but she just told me to stop over-reacting. Jonathon was born and he was OK.’

The
 couple later separated and Miss Thorpe went to police, accusing Mr 
Hanlon of domestic violence.

When officers knocked on his door last 
December he told them she was lying, and handed over the footage he had 
shot as evidence of her character.

Mr
 Hanlon added: ‘I couldn’t believe it when the police didn’t press 
charges. I also sent the video to social services who have been sending 
someone round to see her regularly, but anyone can put an act on in 
front of them.’

Miss 
Thorpe’s family have claimed her current partner is Jonathon’s 
biological father, although the man himself has denied that.

Miss 
Thorpe, who now lives with her one-year-old son at the home of her 
parents in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, refused to comment yesterday.

The
 West Midlands Police investigation report of the incident, dated 
January 3, states that Miss Thorpe was thought to be eight months’ 
pregnant when the video was shot.

It
 says that a social worker estimated that, ‘On a scale of 1-10  (1 being
 the softest, 10 being  the hardest)...the blows are around 5 or 6’.

The
 document adds that after delivering the blows, ‘Heather puts the hammer
 down and gestures as if to say, “See? I’ve done it”.’ It also reveals 
that six weeks after Jonathon was born, Miss Thorpe bragged to social 
workers that he could give the ‘V-sign’ on demand.

Mr
 Hanlon released the video after a local paper ran a story last week 
about how Jonathon was a precocious ‘superkid’, quoting Miss Thorpe 
claiming he could walk, talk and read at the age of one.

A
 West Midlands Police spokesman said: ‘A report was received in December
 2012 from a member of the public regarding footage of a pregnant woman 
self-harming.

‘A thorough 
investigation was undertaken by police and no criminal offences were 
found. The matter was referred to local adult and child services.’
