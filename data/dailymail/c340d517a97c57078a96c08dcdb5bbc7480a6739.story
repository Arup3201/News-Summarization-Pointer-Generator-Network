Climate talks were hanging in the balance last night, as the world’s nations argued over who should take responsibility for reducing greenhouse gases.

But as world leaders talked into the night, it emerged that the 12-day summit in Peru had generated more carbon dioxide than an entire African country.

More than 12,500 politicians, diplomats, green activists and journalists flew to Lima for the United Nations summit, the latest in a 20-year series of annual climate meetings.

Shocking: It emerged that the 12-day summit in Peru had generated more carbon dioxide than an entire African country

The talks have produced more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the UN admitted, giving the Lima summit the largest carbon footprint of any meeting in the two-decade history of the negotiations.

That is more than the emissions produced by entire nations such as Malawi, Sierra Leone, Fiji or Barbados over the same 12-day period.

The summit is to produce a legally-binding treaty forcing every nation in the world to reduce greenhouse gases.

The talks were scheduled to have finished last night, but were expected to overrun into the weekend as the 192 nations failed to reach an agreement on crucial points.

Britain alone has a team of 45 negotiators at the summit, including Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey and civil servants from three different Government departments.

Jorge Alvarez, project coordinator for the UN Development Programme, said the emissions were so high because a plan to run the summit on green power went wrong.

Instead the huge negotiating complex, built from scratch in the Peruvian capital, has been run on dirty diesel generators.

Organisers had planned to draw power from Peru’s national grid, half of which is fed by green hydroelectric power.

‘We worked to upgrade transformers and generators but for some reason it didn’t work,’ said Mr Alvarez.

Huge temporary structures were built on empty fields the size of 11 football pitches behind Peru’s army’s headquarters.

Concrete was laid, plumbing installed and more than 300 buses hired to transport negotiators to the venue.

Japan had donated 121 electric and hybrid vehicles for the summit – but they have been nowhere to be seen in Lima.

‘Unfortunately, most didn’t arrive,’ Mr Alvarez said, blaming shipping bureaucracy.

The thousands of flights, from delegates across the world, has produced 30 per cent of the estimated total.

Some 6,817 civil servants and politicians, 1,025 UN officials, 3,630 green activists and 1,060 journalists registered for the summit.

The carbon emissions of the UK delegation to Lima are estimated at 220 tonnes.

Each British official attending has carbon footprint of 4.9 tonnes over the 12 days in flights and hotel rooms – it would take the average UK citizen more than seven months to produce the same amount.

Mr Alvarez insisted 100 per cent of the emissions would be offset by Peruvian forestry schemes which would absorb carbon dioxide.

Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Forum, a climate-sceptic think tank, said: ‘UN climate meetings are the most lucrative and most attractive perks for the tens of thousands of green bureaucrats and climate activists who are travelling around the world while telling others to curtail their carbon footprint.

‘It’s a wandering circus of champagne greens to the most outstanding beauty spots and most luxurious hotels on earth.’

Negotiators are trying to reach a global agreement on how to slow the pace of climate change, to replace the disastrous 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was ignored by major powers including the US.

Diplomats have been trying to build bridges ever since, with the aim of signing a final treaty in Paris in December 2015.

They hoped to have a draft agreement in place by yesterday afternoon, with a firm roadmap expected as to how each country would commit to taking action over the coming months.

But the talks stalled as nations bickering about the scope and extent of the pledges.

A key hurdle is a bitter divide between rich and poor nations.

US Secretary of State John Kerry called for poorer nations to step up and take responsibility for the problem

Many developing countries say the West should bear responsibility for taking more action on climate change because they industrialised earlier and have been polluting the atmosphere for longer.

US Secretary of State John Kerry called for poorer nations to step up and take responsibility for the problem.

‘We simply don’t have time to sit around going back and forth about whose responsibility it is to act,’ he told the summit.

‘Pretty simple, folks - it’s everyone’s responsibility, because it’s the net amount of carbon that matters, not each country’s share.’

Britain and the US want the pledges to contain transparent details about how much each country plans to reduce their emissions.

But China and Saudi Arabia rejected the call for public scrutiny – and said only Western nations should have to produce detailed information about their pledges.

Mr Davey told the Mail last night: ‘It is important that we are the toughest, toughest negotiators. People need to know that when Paris concludes next year that there is a set of rules of governance structure which will force every country to adhere to them.

‘Yes we are going to play tough, because I think we have to.’

The cost of the trip to UK taxpayers is estimated to be between £300,000 and £400,000.

A spokesman for the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat said: ‘The UN like many organizations and businesses use video conferencing and other communications technologies to “meet”. But no one has yet found a really credible alternative to face to face intergovernmental negotiations.’

A spokesman for the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘The size of the delegation is consistent with that in previous years.

‘Climate change is among the world’s most complex international negotiations - our delegation is an example of efficiency in engaging in such a huge and important process.’
