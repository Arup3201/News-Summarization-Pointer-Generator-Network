The U.S Government has issued a controversial video telling office workers what to do should a crazed gunman storms their building.

Issued by Homeland Security, the video, called Active Shooter Situation: Options for Consideration, tells workers to flee if it is safe or find a hiding place if trapped should a gunman storm the building.

The video even advises using scissors as a weapon to defend yourself if your are caught in the open.

The four minute clip begins with chilling images of some of 
the most deadly public shootings in recent U.S history including the 
2007 Virginia Tech massacre which saw 32 people shot dead, the 2009 mass
shooting at Fort Hood in Texas and the attempted assassination of 
former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011.

Advice: The video has been released as part of Barack Obama's bid to drive down gun related crime in the U.S

Hide: The video shows office workers scrambling for hiding places while a crazed gunman stalks the building

Take cover: The video recommends staying out of the line of fire

Out of sight: A woman is seen hiding behind a chair and an office bin in a bid to keep out of the shooter's eye line

It then gives a range of advice telling people to 'identify escape routes' from their building, to 'have a plan in mind' and to 'obey instructions'.

The video shows actors playing office workers, fleeing a building, hiding under desks and barricading themselves in darkened rooms.

As well as offering practical such as keeping quiet, switching mobile phones to silent and taking cover out of the line of fire, the clip also shows a worker grabbing a pair of scissors and brandishing them like a weapon.

The scene is accompanied by advice from the narrator who warns: 'If you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available.'

Plan ahead: The video warns workers to identify escape routes from their building

Be prepared: According to Homeland Security it is best to have a plan in mind should a gunman attack

Hide: Workers sitting around a meeting table learn that there is a gunman in the building and leap up from their seats

Safety: The workers hide under the meeting table

Get out: The video recommends fleeing the building if it is safe to do so

Safety first: A Homeland Security clip suggests arming yourself with a pair of scissors if a crazed gunman attacks your workplace

The narrator sagely suggests locking the door of your hiding place or blocking the door with heavy furniture.

The advice is to only call 911 when it's safe to do so and to tell the operator your location, the number of shooters, details of the shooter's weapons, and the number of potential victims.

He also suggests obeying police orders when tactical teams arrive at the scene, telling workers to keep their hands visible, make no sudden movements, to avoid pointing and not to scream or yell.

The video has been released as part of an ongoing attempt by President Barack Obama's administration to drive down gun-related violence in the wake of last month's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Connecticut, which saw 26 children and teachers shot dead.

The 'Options for Consideration' video was already in production before that incident and Homeland Security has been running a programme to prepare people for a shooting incident.

Dial for help: The video suggests waiting until it is safe to call police

Help others: Stopping others from entering a dangerous building is key to surviving a shooter situation, say Homeland Security

The advice to arm yourself with scissors may seem bizarre, but security consultant Andrew Scott told the New York Post that the information in the video is 'adequate'.

He conceded that Homeland Security was correct in recommending that people use scissors to attack a gunman but only in a 'last, worst-case scenario.'

'Just the suggestion [to fight back] is a positive move,” said Scott, a former SWAT commander in North Miami Beach.

'You don’t want to be sheep for the slaughter.'

President Obama has pledged a ban on 
military-type assault rifles and high capacity ammunition clips as well 
as more stringent background checks on anyone wishing to buy a gun.

The proposals have proved controversial.

Drop your weapon: If you are carrying scissors, make sure you drop them put your hands above your head and spread your fingers when police arrive
