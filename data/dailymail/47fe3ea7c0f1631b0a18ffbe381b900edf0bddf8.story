Manchester City will move their first-team training base to the club's new £200million facility next month.

The state-of-the-art complex will now open in phases from October to November, with manager Manuel Pellegrini and his squad officially relocating during the next international break.

Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention, City's head of infrastructure development and corporate responsibility, Pete Bradshaw, said: 'Last year we had one of the worst summers we have had with a lot of rain and that put everything back three months.

'We hoped to catch that up. We haven't managed to do that, so we will take the international break in October to move the first team, the half-term break to move the academy and the rest of the staff will move a fortnight after that.

'We have worked very closely with the first-team coaches and manager to make sure it is not disruptive.'

The new facility, built on an 80-acre brownfield site, features a 7,000-capacity stadium, 17 training pitches and accommodation.
