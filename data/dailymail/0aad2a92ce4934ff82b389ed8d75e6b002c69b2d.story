At 206kg and only 20 years old Nathan Meola was the youngest and heaviest person to audition for The Biggest Loser.

But he didn't make the cut in the final stages for the weight loss reality show and the devastating news caused Nathan to spiral into a deep depression. 

He had pinned every bit of hope he had left on being a contestant to drop the excessive kilos he had struggled with since he was a child growing up in Padstow, in southwest Sydney.

But he slowly overcame the setback and shed an astounding 80kg over the next five years and has maintained his 125kg ripped body for the past three years.

Now 28 years old and working as a personal trainer - Nathan is living proof to his clients that anything is possible without taking extreme measures.

The trainer has hit out at the reality show on his blog comparing it to a 'Japanese game show.'

Nathan grew a great passion for fitness

Nathan said he didn't know why he used to turn to food for comfort but it's all he's ever known.

'It wasn't the food I was addicted to but the act of eating - it was like mental rewards going off in my brain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

Nathan had weight-loss surgery at 18 years-old, the year before he auditioned for The Biggest Loser in 2006, which involved a gastric band inserted to reduce the amount he ate. 

He lost 40kg in six months but said the surgery 'doesn't work just like diets'.

So when Nathan applied for the TV show - he was determined this was the break he had been looking for.

But his world came crashing down around him when the casting agent called with the bad news as he was halfway through an assignment at university.

'She wished me all the best with my weight loss and told me to contact her should I need anything,' he said. 

'I was devastated. All my life I’d been too fat, now at this moment I felt like I wasn’t fat enough. I felt like a failure.'

'All of the happily ever after pictures that had been running through my mind shattered into a million pieces. I would have to say that was the most heart broken I’d ever been in my life.'

'I left uni and cried for the entire day. I never finished that assessment, I failed that subject and almost failed the entire semester. I look back on that day now as my sliding door moment.' 

Nathan quit his job in IT sales and studied as a personal trainer in 2011

No regrets: Nathan dropped the weight on his own

Nathan then stayed at about 200kg for the next four years.

It wasn't until 2010 when he went to a weight loss retreat in the Hawkesbury, about 50km north of Sydney, for four weeks that his life began to transform and he never looked back.

'It was a great experience and the beginning of my changes,' he said. 

'It was the first time I learnt any kind of sustained exercise and it helped me develop a passion for fitness.'

His passion for exercise became so strong that he studied as a personal trainer the following year.

He also quite his job in IT insurance and worked part time at a health food store.

'I trained with people who inspired me and created an environment around me of people who motivated me so it wasn't hard to be healthy everyday.'

Following his success story, Nathan wrote a scathing blog about The Biggest Loser saying contestants 'can’t come out of an experience like that and just be ok'.

'Deep emotional and mental issues that caused the eating addiction in the first place are just brushed aside, replaced by the distraction of the competition, the thrill of potentially life changing prize money, and the promise of dramatic weight loss, combined with the ultimate accountability, cameras broadcasting you to an entire nation,' he says in his blog.

Nathan said feels like a completely different person from his heftier days

H added that the show was not about telling the success stories of people achieving their goals.

'If that were the case then it wouldn’t be a glorified Japanese game show,' his blog said.

'Contestants wouldn’t be forced to compete against each other in weigh- ins, you wouldn’t have survivor style vote offs, you wouldn’t reward for extreme weight loss and punish for weight gain.'

Nathan said he has met former contestants and seen first hand the toll it had taken on them. 

'I’m not sure of the percentage but I know that the majority of the contestants have struggled to maintain their weight once leaving the show,' he said.

He then refers in his blog to a 2008 contestant Andrew Costello who claims that about 75 per cent of the contestants from that series were back at their starting weight. 

Nathan told Daily Mail Australia a female contestant from the show joined him at the weight-loss retreat in 2010.

'She was  really struggling with weight at the time, he said. 

'She had put all of the weight back on - plus more - and is now left with even more damage to try to clear up than she when she started.'

Nathan lives with no regrets saying that not being rejected for the show meant that he had to learn to change his lifestyle without support.

'I had to take the time to fail over and over and over again. I had to get comfortable with how long it takes, and I had to slowly cultivate an environment that supports a healthy life,' he said 

'Most importantly I had to learn about balance, integrating health and fitness seamlessly into my life to create sustainability. 

Although he admits it was a tough road and there was a lot more to turning his life around than 'cutting out Macca's and getting a gym membership' - he still indulges when he likes.

'Now that  I work out six days a week including weight training three to four times a week - I can eat what I like,' he said. 

'Though I have a lot of veggies, fruit, dairy and unprocessed meats - I still have pizza on a Saturday night if I want it.'

He also enjoys chowing down on steak with a creamy sauce and burgers and a side of fries. 

The new improved Nathan feels like a completely different person from his heftier days. 

'My shift in mind set has been so dramatic that is it hard to relate to that now,' he said.

'It's hard to imagine trying to walk around with that kind of weight.'
