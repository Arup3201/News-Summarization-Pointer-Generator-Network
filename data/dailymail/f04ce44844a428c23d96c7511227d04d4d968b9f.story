Spending watchdogs are to investigate claims that private colleges are letting thousands of students accept taxpayer-backed loans without turning up to classes.

Up to 3,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have been claiming the money to study without proper proof of residence in the UK, it is alleged.

One college, dubbed the ‘cashpoint’ by students, was yesterday said to be running classes which were largely empty.

The London School of Science and Technology (LSST) in Wembley is accused of recruiting students off the street and ignoring a lack of basic skills to put more of them on its books.

It is claimed that in one ‘ghost’ class, not a single youngster had turned up 35 minutes after the lesson had started.

‘They go to the gym or the pub, or anywhere they like, but they don’t show up to class,’ LSST student Krisztian Muhasci, 34, told the Mail.

A whistleblower told how a Romanian student described her approach. ‘She said “I get on a plane, I come to London. I stay for a week or two, and then I go back home and I get my student loan, maintenance, and I make more money than I would [in Romania]”.’

Chairman, Margaret Hodge, of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was 'shocked' at the claims

The Commons Public Accounts Committee has asked the National Audit Office to investigate the possible misuse of public funds by private colleges.

It follows Coalition reforms which allowed students at such institutions to claim maintenance loans and grants worth up to £11,000 a year.

Colleges can be handed £6,000 in tuition fees for each student they enrol.  

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ‘pretty shocked’ at the claims.

‘We’re talking about many hundreds of millions, if not a couple of billions, in taxpayer money which was set aside to support higher education,’ she said.

Her remarks follow an investigation into the LSST by the Guardian, which allegedly found some classes had attendance rates of below 40 per cent.

Over the past three years, its students have received more than £25million while the college has benefited from £6.5million paid to it in tuition fees.  

A wider investigation into private colleges by the Department for Business is said to have found that 3,000 Romanian and Bulgarian students have been claiming loans without proof of residence.

LSST chief executive Syed Zaidi denied the allegations, saying that the college’s admissions procedures were ‘undoubtedly robust’.

Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: ‘Students and the taxpayers who provide funding deserve to get a quality service. I am determined to make sure that they do. Where standards are not being met we are taking action.’
