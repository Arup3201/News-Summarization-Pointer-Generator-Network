A bowling alley turned near deadly on Wednesday when a 74-year-old man entered firing off shots in what police say was a failed attempt to shoot his estranged wife.

Armando Tritto entered the Staten Island, New York bowling alley just before 9am, aiming for his 47-year-old wife who was working behind the snack bar in Dongan Hills, police report.

Armed with a .357 Magnum revolver, Tritto fired at least three shots at Maureen Tritto who dove into a closet before the last one was fired through its closed door.

Shooting: Armando Tritto, 74, pictured beside his estranged wife Maureen Tritto, 47, was arrested on Wednesday after allegedly trying to shoot her behind a bowling alley's snack bar

Failing in his shots, which miraculously spared all other employees at Rab's County Lanes, Armando Tritto dropped his firearm at the scene and fled.

Police reported him escaping in a white Ford Fusion before his arrest in Todt Hill which slightly injured two officers after a struggle, SILive.com reports.

Armando Tritto was taken to a local hospital complaining of chest pains before being charged with attempted assault, criminal use and possession of a firearm, reckless endangerment and resisting arrest, the New York Daily News reports.

Inside, Maureen Tritto was found highly emotional but uninjured.

Hunted: Maureen Tritto, who worked at the bowling alley (pictured) for what regulars said has been for the last two years, dove into a closet to shield herself from her husband's shooting

Injuries: No one was injured in the shooting though Armando Tritto, pictured with his wife, was hospitalized for chest pains after his arrest

'She was sitting down afterward. She was really crying. She didn’t want anyone to bother her,' 70-year-old bowler Authur White told the Daily News after entering the lanes moments after the shooting.

Mr White estimated that Maureen Tritto has worked at the lanes for the last two years while her Facebook page listed her working behind the Gennaro's snack bar counter since 2008.

Any sign of the couple having a troubled marriage was disguised from both their Facebook pages by Wednesday night.

Maureen Tritto described herself on her own page with: 'fabulous husband ... gorgeous children .... incredible job .... amazing family ... that's life in a nut shell ... and I'm loving it!!!!'

Life together: Pictured at his birthday, the couple appear to show no sign of previous foul play between them with Maureen Tritto describing him as a fabulous husband

'I go in for coffee a lot; she's really nice,' local bowler Wilbur Koenig told SILive.com. He said he arrived to the scene just in time to witness Armando Tritto's vehicle pealing out of the parking lot.

'I walked in there and somebody said Maureen's husband shot her,' Mr Koenig said.

Frank WIlkinson whose family owns the bowling alley told the paper that there were only three staff members present during the incident.

Dozens of police cars responding to the scene scanned the entire building for any other potential threats left behind.

Speaking with NewYork1, a Rab's Country Lanes employee called the shooting an isolated domestic issue.

'Thankfully nobody was in the building, nobody was hurt and, you know 
what, the community knows we're here. We really appreciate our family 
and those that come around ... We're
all about safety and we provide a safe environment and that's what 
we're about.'
