The 17-year-old father of a baby boy who died just weeks after his birth mother took him back from his lesbian adoptive parents has been charged with first-degree murder.

Four-month-old Gabriel King McFarland was found unresponsive on April 22 by his mother after she left the baby in the care of his father, Drew James Weehler-Smith, at their Des Moines, Iowa home.

The boy later passed away and an autopsy revealed that Gabriel died of an abusive head trauma, which authorities say he suffered at the hands of his teen dad.

The 
tragedy came just a month after the teen mother, Markeya Atkins, changed
 her mind about giving him up for adoption and took him back from the 
women who had brought him up as their own.

Loss: Four-month-old Gabriel McFarland died on 
April 22 after he suffered an abusive head trauma while in the care of 
his teenage father. Gabriel's mother had just taken him back from an 
adoption

Investigators have not yet determined how the baby suffered the deadly injuries but his teen dad was the only one at home with the boy, police told the Des Moines register.

Gabriel's mother, Markeya Atkins, 
had left him in the care of his father so she could run errands around 7.25pm on April 22, police said.

About 25 
minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone 
charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the 
mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith.

Atkins asked her friend to return to the 
apartment but when she did, she saw the father driving away without
 the baby.

Teen mom: Markeya Atkins, 16, took the boy back on March 13, three months after the youngster was born

Loss: Atkins said she could never have imagined that her son would have died after being returned to her

She
 notified the mother, who rushed home and found Gabriel limp and not 
breathing in a glider chair.

'Someone left my 
friend's baby that they were baby-sitting by themselves, and the baby's 
blue,' the friend can be heard saying on the 911 calls, with Atkins crying in the background: 'He just left him here.'

Atkins'
 friend performed CPR before emergency medical personel took over. But the boy was pronounced dead at hospital.

Weehler-Smith, a junior at Des Moines Roosevelt High 
School, was initially charged with neglect of a dependent person but now the murder charge has now been added.

He is being charges as an adult and faces life in prison if found guilty of the murder charge and 50 years behind bars if convicted of endangerment.

Loving moms: The McFarlands said they only heard about Gabriel's death on Tuesday on the news

'I never thought in my wildest dreams this would happen,' Atkins told WHO-TV on Thursday as she spoke out about her son's death for the first time.

She explained that she had initially wanted to give up her son for adoption because she did not think she would be able to care for him.

Rachel and Heidi McFarland adopted the boy and cared for him from birth until he was a few months old - when Atkins changed her mind, as is allowed under Iowa law.

'When you 
have a baby it's like this instinct comes on where a part of you just 
feels like you have something left in this world,' Atkins said.

The
 couple said they were devastated when they learned that the infant they
 had considered their own had died - while watching the news.

Adorable: Police have charged Drew James Weehler-Smith of Des Moines with neglect of a dependent person after he left his son, pictured, alone in an apartment on Tuesday

Scene: According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment, pictured, in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7:25p.m. while she went to the library and to run errands

'It's like he's been taken away from you again,' Rachel McFarland told the Des Moines Register. 'We brought him home from the hospital. I cut his umbilical cord.'

In Iowa, the birth mother has three months and then one additional 
31-day probationary period to change her mind about giving up her baby.

While devastated, the McFarlands are determined not to let the failed adoption and Gabriel's death ruin their lives.

'We're just left to put the pieces back together,' Rachel said.
