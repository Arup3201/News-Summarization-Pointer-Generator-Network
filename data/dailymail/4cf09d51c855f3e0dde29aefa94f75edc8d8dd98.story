A Norwegian politician has provoked outrage after posting a picture of herself wearing a wolf fur coat on her Facebook page.

Campaigners, who fear that hunters may be about to eradicate the wolf population in the Scandinavian country, expressed their anger at the post by Sandra Borch.

The former youth leader of the Centre Party posted the photograph on her page on Monday.

Sandra Borch, a former youth leader for Norway's Centre party, posted the pictures of her wearing a wolf fur coat on her Facebook page. The move provoked angry criticism from animal rights campaigners

She told VG newspaper: 'I knew there would be reactions, but I want to show that I do not care.'

Almost as soon as Ms Borch published the picture, people began to leave angry posts.

Ms Borch has argued in the past that hunters should be allowed to kill wolves to protect their livestock

The politician has argued that Norwegian farmers should be given permission to hunt and kill wolves, to help protect their livestock.

Siri Martinsen, the leader of the animal rights organization NOAH, condemned Ms Borch's statement, claiming the stunt was designed to provoke a reaction.

She said: 'This initiative is quite predictable for a politician who so strongly advocates the killing of wolves and the use of fur, with all the suffering it inflicts animals.

'She's doing this very clearly to provoke, but I'm pretty sure it does not change the attitude of large sections of the population in Norway who say 'no' to the hunting of wolves and who are critical of the fur industry.'

The Progress Party - the junior party in Norway's right-wing government - has said it has no objection to the complete eradication of wolves.

At the start of each hunting season there are normally around 50 of the animals in the country.

That number is expected to fall to just 20 by the close of the season, with some moving across the border to Sweden but many killed at the hands of the hunters.
