Rymel Downer, 25, was jailed for 17 years after a man was shot in the mouth in south Manchester in May, last year

A man has been jailed for an attempted murder outside a barber’s shop after his DNA was found on a lollipop in the burnt-out getaway car.

Rymel Downer, 25, was jailed for 17 years after a man was shot in the mouth in south Manchester in May, last year.

The 21-year-old victim was hit when three shots were fired from a BMW 330D on Lloyd Street South, Fallowfield, at 3.30pm on May 25.

The getaway car was later found burnt out in Whalley Range.

But forensics teams recovered a lollipop next to the gearstick, containing Downer’s DNA.

A CD wallet left in the vehicle also had Downer’s fingerprints on it.

Detectives gathered further evidence against him.

It included mobile phone records which proved he was in south Manchester at the time of the shooting.

Det Chief Insp Pete Marsh, of GMP’s Major Incident Team, said: 'It is utterly miraculous that the young victim survived this attempt on his life.

'Everything about this incident points to a concerted effort to kill the victim and it is only by the tiniest of margins that he survived.

'Downer was clearly confident of getting away with his crime, however officers quickly build up a wealth of evidence against him and today justice has been done.'

Downer, of Moss Side, was found guilty of attempted murder following a trial at Manchester Crown Court

After the shooting the victim was bundled into a car and driven to hospital where he had emergency surgery and survived his ordeal.

Downer, of Moss Side, was found guilty of attempted murder following a trial at Manchester Crown Court.

On Monday he was sentenced to 17 years.
