Draped in flags, South African football shirts, and even their pyjamas and dressing gowns, hundreds of mourners took to the streets around the Johannesburg house of former South African President Nelson Mandela last night as news broke of the death of the man who gave them freedom.

By this morning, as South Africa awoke to a country without its spiritual and moral leader, the mood of the crowd outside the property in the wealthy estate of Houghton, where Mandela died aged 95, had changed to one of exuberant celebration of a man whose struggle had touched so many.

Police had set up a cordon in the exclusive street but there was no sign of trouble - instead people joined in a spontaneous tribute to Mandela, where one man played a vuvuzela and others linked arms and sang struggle songs while swaying in front of a framed photograph of Mandela propped against a tree.
