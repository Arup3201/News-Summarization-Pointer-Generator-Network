Josh Parsons, identified on Twitter as one of the Chelsea fans on a Paris Metro carriage when a black man was shoved off, is a 'vocal' UKIP supporter who once enjoyed a pint with Nigel Farage.

The former public schoolboy posed for a photo with Farage outside a central London pub which was posted on Instagram with the caption: 'UKIP BOYS! What a geezer'. 

City worker Parsons was identified as one of the group seen pushing the commuter off the train on Tuesday while a chant of 'We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it' is heard in shocking footage. 

The Chelsea fan pictured on a train where fans were heard singing a racist chant, Josh Parsons, published a picture of himself having a drink with Nigel Farage with the caption: UKIP BOYS! 'What a geezer'

It came as the Frenchman pushed off the Metro train was revealed to be Souleymane S, 33, who told Le Parisien newspaper: 'These Chelsea supporters should be punished', and confirmed he was making a formal criminal complaint.

The married father of three, who comes from a Mauritanian background, said he intends to visit a police station in the French capital to make a complaint on Thursday.

Mr Parsons, a former pupil of Millfield School, where fees are £11,150 a term for boarders, studies business at Regent's University London, a friend said. 

Ash Williams wrote on Twitter: 'That is Josh Parsons in the black jacket (second from right) season ticket holder.' 

His former school, in Street, Somerset, was attended by James Hewitt, singer Lily Allen and several sports stars.

Finance worker Josh Parsons is just as '21-year-old little boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time', his boss said

He now works for the Business and Commercial Finance Club in central London.

Yesterday, Mr Parsons' social media profiles had been taken down and his family did not respond to enquiries. 

A friend said that he was a backer of UKIP, but the party said today they 'have no idea who he is', and said the picture was taken in a chance meeting outside a London pub. 

Speaking outside his Mayfair office this morning, his boss Miranda Khadr said Mr Parsons would not be coming into work this morning.

She said: 'He is very scared at the moment and he called me to say he is not coming in today.

'He is not that type of person at all (to have taken part in racist chants), he works with me and I'm not English.

'He is a 21-year-old little boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

A second man on the metro train stood behind Mr Parsons was named locally at Jordan Munday, from south-east London.

There is no suggestion that either was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting. 

However, having been inside the carriage during the incident, both will be key witnesses for the police.

Prosecutors have already launched a criminal enquiry for 'voluntary racial violence on public transport', which is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine equivalent to £33,000.

Speaking for the first time, Souleymane – who said he was attacked 'because of the colour of my skin' – said: 'I didn't know that I was filmed. The fact that it is being talked about has given me the courage to go and make a complaint to the police.

'These people, these English supporters ought to be found, punished and ought to be locked up. What happened should not go unpunished.'

Souleymane lives in the Val-d'Oise department to the north of Paris, and was on his way home from his job close to the Richelieu-Drouot Metro station, in central Paris, soon after 7pm on Tuesday evening.

He tried to get on to a train, but found it packed with Chelsea fans on their way to watch the London side's European Champions League game against Paris St Germain.

Chelsea fan Jordan Munday has been named locally as also being on the train.  There is no suggestion he was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting but could be a key witness for police

The Chelsea supporters were filmed pushing a black man off the packed train at Richelieu-Drouot station on the Paris Metro

He told Le Parisien: 'I wanted to get into the carriage but a group of English fans blocked me and pushed me away.

'I tried to force my way on, I kept trying to get back on. In the scramble, I lost my phone. They told me things in English but I did not really understand the meaning of their words.

'I don't speak a word of English. I understood that they were Chelsea fans, and I made the connection with the PSG match, which was taking place the same evening.

'I also understood that they were attacking me because of the colour of my skin. You know, I live with racism, I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the Metro.

'I stood in front of them for a long time. Someone came up to me afterwards and said I'd been brave to stand up to such people.

'I think the whole thing lasted about six or seven minutes.

Referring to Metro workers, Souleymane said: 'After while, RATP staff intervened, but only to make sure there wasn't any fighting.

'Their aim was to make sure the traffic resumed on the line. No other passengers defended me, but anyway, what could anyone do?

'Then the train left, and I walked away, and waited for the next train. I went home and didn't mention what happened to anyone, not even my wife and children.'

'What was I meant to say to my children? That Dad was pushed and shoved in the Metro because he's black? That's hopeless'.  

The man can then be seen remonstrating with the fans, asking for them to let him on and appearing to insist there is sufficient room for him to stand - but he is then pushed off again

The footage was filmed before the Premier League team's 1-1 draw in a Champions League fixture with Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes

The Prime Minister has called the video – shot after Chelsea drew with Paris Saint- Germain on Tuesday night in the UEFA Champions League – 'extremely disturbing'. Chelsea Football Club labelled it 'abhorrent'. 

It evokes the hooliganism that plagued the team in the 1970s. Last night, UK police were hunting those pictured as Chelsea launched a hotline for fans to turn them in. 

They face three years in prison if caught in France, and Scotland Yard said it would consider barring them from matches for up to ten years. David Cameron said: 'I'm sure the French police will be looking at it very seriously.'

The minute-long video was filmed by a British expatriate who sent it to The Guardian. In it, the black man attempts to board, but the gang shove him off.

Chelsea's first black player, Paul Canonville has called for the men to be banned from football for life

The commuter, who is not wearing club colours, asks them to let him on. They shout and push him as he tries to board again. 

A black woman leaves by another door as chants of 'We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it' start.

Paul Nolan, who filmed the clip, told The Guardian: 'He was obviously completely shocked … I don't think he realised who they were. There definitely was a culture shock. I heard a couple of French guys saying: 'I can't believe this. It's insane.'

The fans also chanted 'Where were you in World War Two?' at French passengers, he said.

Chelsea's first black star, Paul Canoville, said the men must be banned for life – but a fan who was on the train claimed it was not a racist attack.

Mitchell McCoy, 17, said: 'A few people were pushing him off because there wasn't much space. People were saying it was because he was black. It's not true at all. I think it's because he was a PSG fan.' 

Of the chanting, he said: 'That song was about John Terry. The only words I know is 'He's a racist, he's a racist'.'

Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 in 2012 for racially abusing then QPR star Anton Ferdinand. 

The Paris prosecutors' office said it was investigating 'racial violence on public transport', punishable by three years in prison and a £33,000 fine. 

There were also reports of UK fans singing anti-Semitic songs and imitating the sound of gas escaping, a vile reference to the Holocaust.

Chelsea said it will 'take the strongest possible action' if the men are club members, adding: 'Such behaviour is abhorrent and has no place in football or society.'
