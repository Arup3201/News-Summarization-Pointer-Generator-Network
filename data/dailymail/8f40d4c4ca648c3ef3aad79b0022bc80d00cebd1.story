A man who cannot put on weight yet suffers with type 2 diabetes has finally discovered what is wrong with him.

Scientists have diagnosed Tom Staniford, one of Britain's leading para-athletes, with MDP syndrome - a condition caused by a single genetic mutation but is responsible for a variety of seemingly unrelated problems.

Tom, 23, was born at normal weight, but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs.

His
 condition means he has no natural cushioning on his body, suffers from 
sore feet, and is at an increased risk of breaking bones in a fall.

Tom's rare condition is triggered by a single genetic mutation which causes a variety of symptoms including weight loss, type 2 diabetes, fused bones and hearing loss

Because
 of the disorder, Tom has unusually high fat levels in his blood, as if 
he was obese. It is this that has led to him developing diabetes.

His hearing also deteriorated during childhood, and he now wears hearing aids.

Tom hopes the new diagnosis will allow 
him to be more accurately classified for events and help his chances of 
success. He is bidding to participate in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.

MDP syndrome is an extremely rare and complex condition and is only known to affect eight people in the world.

He and other patients were found to 
have an abnormality in the POLD1 gene that gives rise to a defective 
enzyme crucial to DNA replication.

He said: 'In some ways, identifying the syndrome 
behind my symptoms shouldn't be important - a name is just a name, after
 all - but it is reassuring to know that there are other people with the
 condition and that we can lead relatively normal lives,' he said.

'What
 could prove crucial, though, is enabling me to be properly classified 
in competitions so that I am not competing at an unfair disadvantage 
against others.

'I 
hope to be able to compete for Great Britain in the 2016 Paralympics and
 this finding could make a real difference to my chances.'

Scientists describe the research that led to Tom's diagnosis in the journal Nature Genetics.

Researchers at the University of 
Exeter, where Tom studied law, compared the cyclist's entire genetic 
code with that of three other patients with the same symptoms. The DNA 
of their family members was also analysed.

Professor
 Andrew Hattersley, a Wellcome Trust senior investigator at the 
university's medical school, said: 'Tom's condition has been a puzzle to
 us for many years. We could see the symptoms, including the very 
unusual case of type 2 diabetes in someone with no obvious body fat, but
 did not know what was causing them.

Tom, a paralympic cyclist, hopes that the new diagnosis will help him be more accurately  assessed for his place in the 2016 Rio Paralympics

'We had to look at 30 million base pairs (chemical components of DNA) in Tom's DNA, and similar numbers in his family members and other patients, to identify the single mutation. This would not have been feasible even a couple of years ago.'

In 2011, Tom became the youngest solo cyclist to be British National Paracycling Circuit Race Champion.

Michael Dunn, head of genetic and molecular sciences at the Wellcome Trust, said: 'This is a great example of genome sequencing coming of age.

'Where previously sequencing a patient's entire genome was prohibitively expensive, it is now far more cost effective.

'As we've seen here, it is no longer just about identifying genes implicated in common diseases, but is about informing diagnoses and prognoses of rare diseases - and, in Tom's case, helping inform his sporting performance.'
