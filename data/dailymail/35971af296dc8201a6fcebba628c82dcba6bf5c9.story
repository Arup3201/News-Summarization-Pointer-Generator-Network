Why not surprise someone this Christmas with a more offbeat calendar for 2014 - featuring the world's bendiest woman. 

Russian-born Zlata, 27, can contort herself into the most extreme poses imaginable and has posed for 12 wonderfully weird shots for each month of the year. 

The former gymnast, who is 5ft 8in, makes every shot an opportunity to show off her suppleness.

Zlata, whose real name is Julia Gunthel, is so flexible she can cram herself into a 50cm squared box. 

She said she was just four-years-old when she discovered her talent and has been bending over backwards ever since.

In 2011 she won a Guinness World record for the fastest time to burst three balloons with her back which she did in just 12-seconds. 

According to the blonde she spends most of her day working out and training for shows around the world.

One of her favourite acts is bending herself backwards at a perfect 90 degree angle, virtually cutting herself in half so the back half of her hands touch her feet.

Her talents also include squeezing herself into boxes just 50cm squared.

Zlata has previously said: ‘Doing these poses just feels natural to me.

'Sometimes it can get a bit uncomfortable if I have to hold a pose for a long time in photoshoots.

‘But I think that’s like anyone who sits down for a long time – their muscles get stiff.

‘I don’t really diet but I have to train very hard to keep my muscles in shape and to be as flexible as possible.’

She does however have a rare condition which makes all her tendons extremely pliable, which helps in her profession.

But she faced jealousy from other girls at a young age in school, due to her abilities.

Zlata, who now lives in Germany, said: ‘In Russia being flexible is a very good thing to be because everyone is really into gymnastics.

‘Some of the other girls didn’t like how good I was.’
