First came the Tamworth Two, now the Durham Duo.

Two little black pigs brought drama to the coastal town of Seaham after escaping from an allotment.

Police raced into action as traffic was held up by the runaway pair, and one was last night under arrest after being found rooting for food in a waste bin.

Pig hunt: Two of the animals went on the run yesterday but this one was caught after it stopped to raid a bin for a bite to eat

But its friend continued to show 
officers a clean pair of trotters and, as night fell, the trail was as 
cold as a frozen pork chop.

The drama in Seaham, six miles south 
of Sunderland, is reminiscent of the famous dash for freedom made by 
Butch and Sundance – the Tamworth Two – in 1998.

The story of the Tamworth Two was later made into a hour-long BBC television drama.

They cheated the butcher’s knife by 
going on the run from an abattoir, swimming the River Avon and 
disappearing into a dense thicket.

They were eventually caught but, 
thanks to the Daily Mail, were given a reprieve from their death 
sentence and lived out their days in an animal sanctuary.

All went quiet in the sphere of 
porcine escapology until Wednesday evening, when the two black pigs – 
thought  to be Berkshire crossbreeds – made  a break from Hill Crescent 
Allotments  in Seaham.

One of the runaways was lassoed by 
37-year-old mother-of-three Shereen Temple, who found it in a back alley
with its snout in an overflowing bin. She is keeping it on her own 
allotment until it can be reunited with its friend.

Neighbourhood sergeant Jim Peel of 
said: 'The owner of the pigs normally whistles at them to get them to 
come back. Everyone is keeping an eye out for the one which is still 
missing.'

Police officers were alerted to the 
escapees after being called when one of the pigs was seen trotting along
the middle of the road heading towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub in the 
town.

Sightings of the new fugitives were reported on social networking sites as they caused mayhem around Seaham.

Dan Johnson Stafford commented via Facebook said: 'Not every day you see a pig holding up the traffic lol.'

Safe: The captured pig, nicknamed Porky, is now being looked after back at the allotments but is missing his partner in crime

Helpers: Painter and decorator Shereen Temple lassoed Porky with the help of her son Robert, 11

Munching: It was this pig's prodigious appetite that caught up with it last night, and he is now being fed fresh fruit and vegetables among other delights

After capturing one of the pigs, Seaham Police tweeted: 'After struggling for 30 mins we caught the pig in Fox Street in Seaham.'

Miss Temple, who helped to catch one of the runaway pigs last night. 

The painter and decorator helped to lasso the pig in a back alley after it was cornered by police.

'He was found in a back lane that was full of rubbish,' she said.

'He was scared when we found him, I tried to catch him but he scarpered down  the alley.

'I tried to lasso it once with a dog lead but it slipped away the first time  and the second time I managed to loop it around it's neck.

'The pig has been nicknamed Porky by some, everyone's talking about him.'

Captured: The one pig intercepted was spotted trotting towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub

Shereen kept the pig in her allotment where she keeps 14 chickens. She also owns two horses which are kept in stables, enjoying fresh food including carrots, apples, grass roots  and some horse feed.

'He's having a good time digging up my vegetables and he's being kept  in the chicken shed for now.

'Apparently the other pig was seen near the allotments this morning, and he was caught but he got away before the officers came to rescue him.

'It's been quite exciting helping to catch them - we just want to reunite him with the other one - we don't know if it's his brother or not.'

While the RSPCA took in the runaway pig, the other has still not yet been found.

Police were made aware of a sighting of the other pig at Seaham Harbour around 11pm last night but when they attended, the pig could not be found.

Another sighting was reported at around 8am this morning, but again when officers arrived at the scene, the pig had once again escaped.

Parallels: This latest escape has reminded people of dynamic duo 'The Tamworth Two' Sundance, left, and Butch, who went on the run from an abattoir

Neighbourhood Sergeant Jim Peel said: 'We had a call around 8pm last night to say that there was a pig on the loose.

'It was running around the roads in Seaham.

'Two PCSOs and response officers attended and they chased the pig into a back alley where the pig was detained.

'That was it for about an hour until a second pig was reported to also be loose.

'About 11pm last night there was a second call saying that a pig was running around Strangford Road, Seaham.

'However when officers searched the area, no pig was found.

'Another call came in around 8am this morning to say that a pig had been seen on Mount Stewart Street in Seaham.

'A further area search revealed no signs of the pig, meaning there is still an animal on the loose.'
