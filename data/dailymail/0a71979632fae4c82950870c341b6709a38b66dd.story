A psychiatric hospital has revealed its hidden rooms and treasures which have remained untouched for more than 40 years after it was set up as Quaker hospital in the 18th century.

Hidden beneath The Retreat lies a morgue which has been under lock and key since the 1960s as well as cupboards, swathed in dust, containing finely preserved treasures such as a cannon ball and monkey skull, which have been accumulated in the last 400 years of the hospital.

The hospital, in York, was set up by William Tuke, a retired tea merchant, in 1796 after he was appalled at the conditions at York Asylum, where Quaker Hannah Mills died. 

Many of the buildings which make up the Retreat, which functions as a psychiatric hospital today, are listed making many of them difficult to renovate.

The Retreat in York today remains a fully functioning psychiatric hospital after it was built for Quakers in 1796

Lancashire boilers were installed in the boiler room of the retreat in 1922 and have not been used since 1970s

This meant some rooms and the items donated from patients and collected from around the world were abandoned and left to accumulate dust for dozens of years.

A room in the basement by the main building contains a huge coal boiler used to heat the entire building with a mass of cogs and pipes stretching into the roof.The Lancaster boiler, which was installed in 1922, has remained completely out of use since the late 1970s early 80s.

A pin board, dated 1915, features a poem believed to have been written by the boiler room's former workers, along with another note reading 'Into this boiler room have walked the best people in the world, my friends.'

Also left preserved is the hospital's former morgue, which was built in the Victorian era and fell out of use in the 1960s, when undertakers were able to collect bodies quicker than before.The room houses the original marble slab used for bodies and an incinerator.

The boiler room had not been used since the 1970s and a poem from 1915 was found on the pin boards there

The mortuary, built in 1920s, has laid unused for decades but the original table has been found preserved

An Electro Convulsive Therapy (CVT) machine (left) was found along with silver service equipment (right) 

Old paint, containing lead, was found stored in rooms - many of which have been under lock and key for years 

Another empty building once housed students in the 1940s and 1950s, and still holds exam books from the 1930s.

In the cellars beneath the main building there is a trolley full of film reels, which are likely to have been shown to patients at the hospitals. 

Dozens of dusty cupboards contain items such as oxide plaster, baby powder, tools, aprons and boots, which have all been well preserved over the last three decades.Other items found include is a cannon ball excavated from Lamell Hill, a vase found on the site in an excavation in the 1800s, an ostrich egg and even a monkey skull.

Martyn Ferguson, who works at The Retreat, said some of the rooms have been left under lock and key 

A trolley containing old film reel was found and was probably used from around 1954 as patient training aids 

An incinerator, from the mortuary and pictured left, as well as an ostrich egg (right) were among items found 

A bedroom to accommodate male trainees, built in 1927, was one of the rooms left abandoned at the hospital

Time records, believed to have been completed in the 1930s, were found in rooms at The Retreat 

Several treasures were found preserved in cupboards and dusty rooms, including a ledger of painting work 

The Retreat in York is a psychiatric hospital open today and was built to improve care for Quakers in 1796

The Retreat became officially operational with the arrival of its first patient, Margaret Holt, from Bradford, for a fee of eight shillings per week.

'The history of The Retreat is wonderful,' said Martyn Ferguson, Head of Facilities Management.

'Over the years there have been lots of different buildings in use as the site has always been a place on innovation in the mental health sector.

Medicines and equipment, found preserved on dusty shelves and in corners were revealed in the rooms

Items of equipment, including an old blood pressure taker (left) and silver service equipment (right) were found 

A vase (left) was found on in the 1800s and silver service equipment (right) was in the steward's rooms

An old syringe is among the items found as The Retreat revealed several of its hidden and unused rooms 

Much of the equipment and items found had been preserved, despite not being used for several decades 

 'When they were not required there, we had to close the doors and leaving them as they were. It is very difficult to upgrade a listed building to modern standards, especially with grounds being a conservation area.'

Mr Tuke's grandson, Samuel Tuke, is also buried in the grounds of the site. 

Joseph Rowntree, the businessman, is also been buried there.
