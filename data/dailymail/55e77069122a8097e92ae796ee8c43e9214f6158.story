Samantha Cameron may have been rushed off her feet as she dashed around London, but fashion still came first for the busy mother, as she carried out her errands wearing a towering pair of heels.

Mrs Cameron, who was joined on her walk through St James Park by two of her children, wrapped up warm against the cold weather, teaming her killer heels with a navy blue coat, matching gloves, and a faux fur scarf.

Wearing what appeared to be a knee length skirt and a pair of thick tights, the 42-year-old pushed daughter Florence in a Maclaren pushchair, while daughter Nancy skipped on ahead.

Three-year-old Florence Rose Endellion Cameron has been revealed as the star of Number 10’s official Christmas card, ready to be sent to world leaders and dignitaries.

Captured by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the Camerons’ youngest child gripping her father’s neck while she snuggles against her mother.

The mother looked fresh faced and pink cheeked as she made her way through the park, alongside other Saturday walkers

It is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because David Cameron has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving to Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are pixelated.

Mr Cameron has recently returned from a tour of China, where he announced ambitious plans for trade links with the country.
