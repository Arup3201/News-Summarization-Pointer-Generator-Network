A 66-year-old Wall Street veteran has won the lottery, after two decades of gambling just to make a point.

Robert Fagenson placed second in the New York State Lotto drawn on December 27, matching five of the six numbers and the bonus number to take home a check for $65,243. 

He told the New York Post that he has been playing twice a week for more than two decades, with numbers connected to his wife's birthday, their anniversary and the birthdays of his two daughters.

'I was just wondering if the system really worked,' Fagenson told the Post. 'Now I know it actually works.'

While Fagenson spent an estimated $5,800 on the lottery in the 20 years he has been playing, it does seem to have been a worthy investment - so he plans to continue. 

In the end, $65,000  likely doesn't make much of a dent on Fagenson's overall fortune, since it's approximately the amount he donated to a Long Island-based animal charity in 2011, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

The Native New Yorker graduated from Syracuse University in 1970 with a degree in Transportation Sciences & Finance. 

He went on to spend most of his career on the New York Stock Exchange, where he was once governor of the trading floor and served on the board of directors.

He is currently the CEO of Fagenson and Co, a 50-year-old brokerage that works in investment brokerage and money management as well. 

According to public records, he owns an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth approximately $2.8million according to Zillow.
