An Australian teenager has put herself through 10 weeks of extreme dieting and intense exercise regimes and treatments - including eating baby food and taking daily ice baths - in the quest to achieve the perfect body.

Queensland University of Technology film student Madeleine Humphreys spent the 10 weeks undertaking the excessive fads and treatments for a participatory-style documentary she and fellow filmmaker Kate Paul have submitted for a class project.

The bizarre diets - including a week of baby food and another of just cabbage soup - left the 19-year-old two dress sizes smaller at the end of the 10-week period.

Ms Humphreys said the documentary, titled Am I Perfect? was an attempt to discover what it means to be 'perfect', why people strive for 'perfection' and if it's really worth the effort.

Going into the challenge the pair made a list of celebrity diets, exercise regimes and the most popular beauty treatments.

She concluded the pursuit of perfection, which included the intense fitness regime Cross Fit and freckle removal via laser, was not worth it.

Ms Paul, 23, said Madeleine ended up losing 22kg (48lbs), and started to go a 'little bit crazy'  - especially during the third week when she was eating primarily baby food.

'She ended up not being able to stomach the baby food and stopped eating as a result,' she told the MailOnline.

'That was definitely one of her lowest weeks - she was really down and struggling to complete her daily requirements.

'It was a bit insane - she started going a bit crazy and dreaming about food.

She wasn't all there sometimes and went a bit wacky. There were times when she didn't have to train she would just stay in bed because she had no energy.'

The baby food diet, which involves replacing two daily meals with jars of homemade pureed baby food and keeping the third meal of the day under 600 calories, gained a cult following after actresses Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon revealed they had experimented with it.

Ms Humphreys said the baby food was horrible way of living - but not as bad as the week on the master cleanse (lemon detox) diet.

'It’s a liquid only diet with a mix of maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water and I was combining it with ice baths and an hour’s stairwalking,' she told the Herald Sun.

She also tried the macrobiotic diet, the cabbage soup diet and raw food diet - fads actresses Gwenyth Paltrow, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Demi Moore were following respectively in the past.

Ms Paul said the pair consulted with a dietician and nurse regularly to ensure their were no serious health risks.

'It actually got the point where the nurse said (Maddie) needed to stop because she was losing the weight so quickly,' she said.

'At the beginning she didn't care but she became really focused on what people thought. She was counting calories all the time and trying to get the scales down. It's that type of mentality that can lead to eating disorders.'

The idea for the documentary came about while the budding filmmakers were sitting in a cafe when they noticed an abundance of women's magazines promoting a range of treatments and fad diets.

'It's an issue we are so bombarded with, there is so much pressure on women and their body image,' Ms Paul said.

'Every girl once in their life has tried a diet or body treatment. You feel the pressure particularly as a female to try these things and look like the people you see in the magazines.'

Ms Humphreys told the Herald Sun: 'We’re both passionate about the beauty pressure women put themselves under and how girls our age are trying to create the perfect female form.

'We wanted to unpack what the myths were for ourselves and the audience and the most honest way was to go through it and experience it for ourselves.'

She said sitting in a bath of ice to burn calories and speed up her metabolism was the craziest thing she has ever done.

The 19-year-old said the project also resulted in some positive change, with the teenager keen to implement group workouts and CrossFit sessions into her new lifestyle.

The documentary is expected to be released in the coming months.
