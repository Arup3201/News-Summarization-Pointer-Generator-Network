Felipe Massa crashed out of the Monaco Grand Prix after slamming into the barriers at the same place for the second day in a row.

Massa missed qualifying on Saturday after hitting the wall at Sainte Devote in final practice and was forced to start from the back of the grid.

He had an almost identical accident during lap 29 of the famous race and was in a neck brace but appeared to be OK as he was taken to hospital for checks.

Shortly after Massa's incident, Pastor Maldonado also crashed after Max Chilton appeared to turn into the Venezuelan, forcing him into the barriers.

The Williams driver then careered into the barriers at speed. The race was immediately red flagged after the incident as Maldonado, who walked away from the incident, was taken to the medical centre.

Williams deputy team principal Claire Williams said: 'He is OK and at the back of the garage. He is a bit shaken up but is OK apart from some cuts and bruises.

'It was not a nice accident but we are really pleased that Pastor is okay.' Max Chilton is under investigation for his incident with Maldonado.'
