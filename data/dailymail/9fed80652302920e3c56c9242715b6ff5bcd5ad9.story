Parents will be forced to shell out more than £100 a week to keep a child occupied and cared for during the six-week summer holidays, according to new research.

It found that holiday childcare is becoming increasingly expensive and that one in six parents had to call in sick last year in order to look after their children during the summer break. And other parents had to give up jobs altogether, due to a lack of childcare.

In Britain the average cost of one week's full time, 50 hours, holiday childcare - including holiday clubs and play schemes - now stands at £114.51, according to the Family and Childcare Trust's annual holiday childcare report.

A survey of parents found that around 17 per cent had to take days off work sick last year to cover childcare during the summer holiday period while others had to give up jobs

Overall, the cost of holiday care is about 1.7 per cent more expensive than last year, the survey found.

Prices dropped 3.1 per cent in the maintained sector - childcare run by local councils and other public sector bodies - but increased by 2.7 per cent in the private sector, including private clubs and play schemes.

The findings show that in England alone, full-time holiday childcare costs on average around £116.18 a week.

Prices are the highest in the South East, with an average weekly cost of £140.88, whilst families in the North West have the cheapest weekly bill at £103.38.

More than a third of those surveyed said it was difficult to find care they could afford during the holiday period, and two thirds, 66 per cent, said that the summer holidays is the most difficult time to find it

In Wales holiday childcare costs £109.66 on average, and in Scotland it is £104.28.

A
 survey of parents conducted by website Netmums and the trust found that
 around 17 per cent had to take days off work sick last year to cover childcare.

This represents almost a million working days lost, the trust said, which it claims costs the economy almost £100million each year.

Family and Childcare Trust chief executive Anand Shukla said parents should not be forced to take sick days to manage their childcare needs

A quarter of the parents questioned said that they had been forced to cut their working hours during the school holidays, and one in eight said they had given up jobs because they could not find childcare.

More than a third of those surveyed, 35 per cent, said it was difficult to find care they could afford, and two thirds, 66 per cent, said that the summer is the most difficult time to find childcare.

Family and Childcare Trust chief executive Anand Shukla, said: 'A combination of unaffordable prices, lack of holiday childcare and inflexible employers is not only causing stress for parents, but it's bad for the economy.

'Most parents have no choice but to work, and should not have to take sick days to manage childcare. This is not the way to operate a modern economy.'

Mr Skukla said the trust is calling on employers and head teachers to help parents manage the school holidays, and for the government to develop a new childcare stratedy that 'properly represents the realities working families face today'.

The study was based on data collected from local authorities and a survey of 1,587 parents.
