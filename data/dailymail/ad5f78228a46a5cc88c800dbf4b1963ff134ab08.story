A gym owner who was shot dead in front of his CrossFit training class on Monday narrowly escaped a shooting last year.

Richard Millsap, a 33-year-old married father-of-two, was forced to take cover as his car was sprayed with bullets on October 14, 2012 in Florida.

He told police at the time that he had no enemies and did not know who would want to shoot him. No one was ever arrested for the attack.

The fitness instructor was shot dead 
earlier this week after a masked man walked up to him in a gym filled 
with people and fired his gun.

Millsap was dead before paramedics arrived at the scene, lying face-down in a pool of blood, according to an incident report released on Wednesday.

The
killer, identified as a black male, and an accomplice are still on the 
loose, following the fatal shooting at the CrossFit Mosaic Gym in Winter
Garden, Florida on Monday. 

The police department released a sketch of the suspect showing him wearing dark glasses and a baseball cap. Evidence included a copper bullet casing on the floor.

Witnesses said that the suspect walked into the gym with his hands in his pocket and straight up to Mr Millsap.

Lt. Scott Allen, spokesman for the Winter Garden police Department, told MailOnline that the victim was a black male in his thirties.

Lt Allen was unable to provide details of where the victim had been shot due to the ongoing investigation. 

There were eight people working out in the gym when the shooting took place just before 7pm, not including the victim.

The killer was chased by one of the gym-goers but he made off in an unidentified car.

No further details were known about the suspects at this time, police said. No one else in the gym was injured but
witnesses were seen sobbing outside the gym following the shooting. 
Many of those at the gym are believed to be close friends with the 
owner.

Members
of the CrossFit community across the country posted their condolences 
and messages of support on the Winter Garden gym's Facebook page.

One friend Matthew Brown wrote in a post that Mr Millsap has a wife and two children.
