Ray Grehan, property developer, is understood to be the former owner of the apartment

It is the most expensive block of flats in Britain, with local shops including Harrods and Harvey Nichols.

But One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge has had its first repossession – a one-bedroom flat worth £5.25million, once allegedly owned by property developer Ray Grehan.

The high-end property agency Strutt & Parker said it had been appointed by receivers to arrange a quick sale of the repossessed ‘entry-level’ flat.

The spacious flat is understood to be previously owned by Mr Grehan, who the Financial Times claim is a bankrupt businessman being pursued by Ireland's National Asset Management Agency.

The apartment is understood to have 
been sold to an offshore company, which the Financial Times claims had 
links to a trust that the property developer is a beneficiary of.

The Knightsbridge property was
then put back on the market following a court settlement between the 
Irish developer and NAMA, the Irish Times reported.

NAMA claimed that the property had been 
undervalued when it was originally sold, the Irish Times claimed, but 
reached a settlement whereby the agency will now receive 85 per cent of 
the net proceeds once the luxury apartment is sold.

For Sale: An 'entry level' £5.25 million, one bedroom flat is back on the market at Knightsbridge's One Hyde Park after the block suffered its first repossession

Luxury: An apartment in One Hyde Park. Residents have private spas and panic rooms

The 'entry-level' flat enjoys one of the most desirable locations in London - and the owner will rub shoulders with the rich and famous

The Financial Times claims NAMA will receive this money once the mortgage owed to Barclays Wealth and Investment Management is paid.

Strutt and Parker refused to comment on the identity of the owner, saying they could not breach their client's confidentiality.

NAMA were unavailable to comment when the Mail Online contacted them.

Peter Wetherell, a leading figure in 
the London property market, said luxury repossessions were uncommon, but
could occur if owners’ business plans went wrong.  

‘Most
of the properties at the top end of the market are cash deals, but for 
their own personal financing reasons [owners] will gear it up [take out a
mortgage on it],’ he said.

The future resident of the sweeping room will enjoy a private spa, squash court, cinema, 21-metre swimming pool, gym and a wine cellar in the building

Flats in the block fetch nearly double the average for the location, averaging between £5,000 and £7,500 per square foot

He suggested the repossessed flat might have been bought to sell on.

Residents
at One Hyde Park are believed to include Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat 
Akhmetov, the Kazakh singer Anar Aitzhanova and the model Naomi 
Campbell’s boyfriend Vladislav Doronin.

They
enjoy ‘bespoke services and amenities’ including a private spa, squash 
court, cinema, 21-metre swimming pool, gym, a golf simulator and a wine 
cellar.

The block has 
high-security features including iris recognition in the lifts, panic 
rooms and bomb-proof windows, and all post is X-rayed.

Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man - estimated worth £143.8m

Professor Wong Wen Young, Taiwanese entrepreneur - estimated worth £29.1m

In
addition to a concierge and valet, residents also enjoy room service 
via a tunnel from the five-star Mandarin Oriental hotel next door.

The
imposing glass tower was unveiled in 2011 at a lavish party with a 
guest list that included Bernie Ecclestone, Lord Lloyd-Webber and Gary 
Lineker.

The flats were built by Project Grande - a joint venture of Christian Candy and the ex-Prime Minister of Qatar - Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al-Thani. They fetch nearly double 
the average for the location, averaging between £5,000 and £7,500 per 
square foot.

Other apartments in the complex have sold for up to 
£140million.

Mr Wetherell 
said: ‘One Hyde Park is an example of the building everyone loves to 
hate, but it redefined the word luxury in central London  property and 
it’s been a resounding success story.’

Critics
complain that flats in the block are rarely occupied.
