Somewhere in their home an incessant bleeping noise was causing the pair endless suffering.

After a year of bearing the noise, and at their wits' end, they decided to pay builders hundreds of pounds to smash through two walls in a bid to find its source.

But the destruction turned out to be fruitless - after they discovered it was an old smoke alarm in a chest of drawers.

Destruction: Paul Henry, pictured, and his wife, spent hundreds of pounds hiring builders to smash through two of their walls to find the source of a bleeping noise

After fruitless searching, Mr Henry found an old alarm clock at the bottom of a chest of drawers

The smoke alarm had a 10-year-old battery inside it which was - unsurprisingly - running out.

Mrs Henry, 68, who lives in Frinton, Essex, with her husband, 67, said: 'To think that we put up with this for a whole year when it had been there in the draw all along.

'But at least the noise had stopped at long last.'

The couple were being driven slowly mad by the bleep after it started more than a year ago.

They finally cracked when the irritating noise went from happening occasionally to going off every 30 seconds for more than two weeks.

After searching high and low, they decided to bring in professionals in their bid to get some peace and quiet.

Retired print worker, Mr Henry, said:
'We really had tried everything to find the damn noise and it had just 
about driven us to the edge of sanity.

'We
really were at our wits’ end - when I was telling friends about it, 
they were looking at me and thinking I was going round the bend.'

The retired print worker was so frustrated when he found the smoke alarm that he smashed it with a hammer

Damage: The couple will now have to pay hundreds of pounds to get the wall fixed

They initially hired an 
electrician to carry out tests on their home’s wiring and when that 
failed, they shelled out £300 for builders to smash holes in 
their two walls with a sledgehammer.

The electrician suggested a builder may have dropped a smoke alarm in a gap in the wall and it was beeping as it ran low on battery power.

He added: 'At first we did think it was our smoke alarms, so we replaced the batteries on them but the noise was still going.

'Eventually it was happening 24/7 and we still had no idea where it was coming from.

'When we hired the electrician, he killed the power to the house yet the beeping continued.

'It
was then that he chirped up and suggested that it sounded like a 
mischievous builder had dropped a smoke alarm into the wall.

'We just had to find out, so I got a local builder in and he crashed through the wall with his sledgehammer.'

Nothing was found. But just as Mr Henry was reaching the end of his tether, he decided to rummage through a chest of drawers.

And to his delight, hidden at the bottom was a five-year-old smoke detector, encasing a 10-year-old battery which was running out.

Upon finding the alarm, Mr Henry decided to smash it to pieces with a hammer.

The couple have now been left with a gaping hole in their wall, which is expected to cost hundreds more pounds to repair.

The alarm was a spare one left over from Mr Henry's voluntary work for Age Concern about five years ago, when he had been handing them out to pensioners.

He added: 'I had been given a load of these alarms and this was one that had been left over and forgotten about at the bottom of the drawer underneath a pile of old Christmas cards.

'Everyone had an opinion on what it might have been, and when I found it and showed it to Jeanette, I said "you are not going to believe this".'
