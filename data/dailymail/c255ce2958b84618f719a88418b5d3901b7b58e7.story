Amish children raised on rural farms in northern Indiana suffer from asthma and allergies less often even than Swiss farm kids, a group known to be relatively free from allergies, according to a new study.

'The rates are very, very low,' said Dr. Mark Holbreich,
the study's lead author.

'So there's something that we feel is even 
more protective in the Amish' than in European farming communities.

Healthy: A study compared Amish children in Indiana to children on farms in Switzerland, where most of the Amish originated

What it is about growing up on farms -- and Amish farms in particular -- that seems to prevent allergies remains unclear.

Researchers have long observed the so-called 'farm effect' -- the low allergy and asthma rates
found among kids raised on farms -- in central Europe, but less is 
known about the influence of growing up on North American farms.

Holbreich, an allergist in Indianapolis, has been 
treating Amish communities in Indiana for two decades, but he noticed 
that very few Amish actually had any allergies.

As studies on the farm effect in Europe began to emerge
several years ago, Holbreich wondered if the same phenomenon might be 
found in the United States.

He teamed up with European colleagues to compare Swiss farming children and non-farming children to Amish kids in Indiana.

Just five percent of Amish children had allergies, compared to 11.2 percent of all Swiss children

Amish families, who can trace their roots back to 
Switzerland, typically farm using methods from the 1800s and they don't 
own cars or televisions.

The researchers surveyed 157 Amish families, about 
3,000 Swiss farming families, and close to 11,000 Swiss families who did
not live on a farm -- all with children between the ages of six and 12.

They found that just five percent of Amish kids had 
been diagnosed with asthma, compared to 6.8 percent of Swiss farm kids 
and 11.2 percent of the other Swiss children.

Similarly, among 138 Amish kids given a skin-prick test
to determine whether they were predisposed to having allergies, only 10
kids -- or seven percent -- had a positive response.

In comparison, 25 percent of the farm-raised Swiss kids
and 44 percent of the other Swiss children had a positive test, the 
researchers report in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

The study did not determine why the kids who grew up on
farms were less likely to develop asthma and allergies, but other 
research has pointed to exposure to microbes and contact with cows, in 
particular, to partially explain the farm effect.

Drinking raw cow's milk also seems to be involved, Holbreich said.

The going theory is this early exposure to the diverse 
potential allergens and pathogens on a farm trains the immune system to 
recognize them, but not overreact to the harmless ones.

As for why the Amish kids have even lower allergy and 
asthma rates than the other farming kids, 'that piece of the puzzle we 
really haven't explained,' Holbreich told Reuters Health.

He speculated that it could be at least partly a result of the Amish having larger families or spending even more time outside or in barns than people on more modern working farms.

Dr Corinna Bowser, an allergist in Cherry Hill, New 
Jersey, said there's also a possibility that inherited factors could 
play a role.

'The Amish are still of a limited genetic pool, I would
assume, because they're much more segregated than the Swiss kids are,' 
she told Reuters Health.

Holbreich said upcoming studies will further 
investigate the differences between the farming groups, with an eye 
toward designing possible interventions.

For instance, pregnant mothers or young children could 
be exposed to the mysterious factors that seem to protect farm kids as a
preventive treatment, he explained.

'The goal is to try to find a way to prevent this 
allergy and asthma epidemic that western populations are facing,' 
Holbreich said.
