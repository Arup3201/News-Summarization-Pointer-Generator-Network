Robin Williams' daughter has been forced off Twitter after internet trolls posted a fake photograph claiming it was her dead father.

Zelda Williams, 25, made an appeal to her 169,000 followers to report two users on Twitter who sent the image to her account. 

She wrote: 'I'm shaking. I can't. Please. Twitter requires a link and I won't open it. Don't either. Please.'

The image has since been revealed to be a fake which was digitally altered to look like Robin Williams. 

The two accounts responsible for the messages, @PimpStory and @MrGoosebuster, have now been suspended.

Furious Twitter users were quick to respond to Zelda to show her their support.

One wrote: 'I hope @zeldawilliams knows the people who love her outnumber the scumbags by about 94,000,000 to 1.'

While another wrote: '@zeldawilliams that is the saddest and sickest thing I have ever seen. I am ashamed if (sic) humanity.'

Later Zelda deleted the tweet but explained how she planned to delete her Twitter account, maybe forever.

She wrote: 'I’m sorry. I should’ve risen above. Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye.'

Zelda has also said she plans to not use Instagram until she 'heals'. She posted: 'I will be leaving this account for a bit while I heal and decide if I’ll be deleting it or not.

'In this difficult time, please try to be respectful of the accounts of myself, my family and my friends. 'Mining our accounts for photos of dad, or judging me on the number of them is cruel and unnecessary.

'There are a couple throughout, but the real private moments I shared with him were precious, quiet, and believe it or not, not full of photos or ‘selfies’. 

'I shared him with a world where everyone was taking their photo with him, but I was lucky enough to spend time with him without cameras too.

'That was more than enough, and I’m grateful for what little time I had. 

'My favorite photos of family are framed in my house, not posted on social media, and they‘ll remain there.

'They would’ve wound up on the news or blogs then, and they certainly would now. That’s not what I want for our memories together. Thank you for your respect and understanding in this difficult time. Goodbye. Xo'.

Last night the actor's heartbroken daughter released a statement about the death of her father.

She wrote: 'My family has always been private about our time spent together. It was our way of keeping one thing that was ours, with a man we shared with an entire world. But now that's gone, and I feel stripped bare.

'My last day with him was his birthday and I will be forever grateful that my brothers and I got to spend that time alone with him, sharing gifts and laughter.

'He was always warm, even in his darkest moments.'

Robin Williams hanged himself on Sunday night while his wife slept in a nearby bedroom.

He had several superficial cuts on the inside of his left wrist.

A pocket knife with what appeared to be dried blood was discovered nearby.

The Mrs Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting star's suicide comes after decades of battling depression and alcohol and drug addiction.

He was also facing significant financial pressures and admitted he was selling a $35million estate in Napa because he could no longer afford it.

Williams struggled with depression and an addiction to cocaine and alcohol for decades. Last month the married father of three was back in rehab 'fine-tuning' his sobriety in a year where he had been working on six movies and a TV series.

Robin Williams was a secret online gamer who was such an avid player, he named his daughter Zelda in honour of his favourite game.

Since his death on Monday, the online gaming community has been paying tribute to the Oscar winning actor who was said to be a huge fan of games such was World of Warcraft and Call of Duty.

One of his favourite series of games is believed to be The Legend of Zelda, and he even named his daughter Zelda Rae, after the princess character in the game.

In 2011, Mr Williams appeared in a commercial for the Nintendo game alongside his daughter.

The advert shows Zelda trying to get her father's attention as he plays the game and ends saying that he had been a fan of Zelda since 1987.

Mr Williams had spoken of his love of online gaming describing it as like 'cyber cocaine'.

He told the Telegraph in 2011: 'Especially if you're online playing against other people, it's totally addictive, you get lost in the world.'  

Now plans are said to be place for World of Warcraft to memorialise the actor as a non-playing character in the game after 11,000 fans signed a petition to urging the game's makers to pay tribute to the 63-year-old.

The petition was created on the website change.org and urged game makers Blizzard to create the character.

It stated: 'It was reported that Robin used to play on the Mannoroth server, and was something of a troll in trade on good days or when anonymity allowed.

'Because of his presence within our community, we the players of ‘World of Warcraft’ are asking Blizzard to kindly create an NPC within the game that memorializes the actor/comedian.'

It then urged Blizzard to 'Create an NPC within World of Warcraft to memorialize the late Robin Williams, an avid World of Warcraft player, and one of the funniest men alive.'

After amassing 11,000 names, Twitter user Celestalon, who is said to be on the game's designers tweeted that they were 'taking care' of the fans' request.

There have also been calls to dedicate the next Zelda game to him.
