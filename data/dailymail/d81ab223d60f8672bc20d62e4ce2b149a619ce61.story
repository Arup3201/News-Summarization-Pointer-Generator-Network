A boarding school education, gifts at Christmas and birthdays …  Charlotte Colquhoun may have been illegitimate, but her baronet father ensured she enjoyed at least some of the privileges of an aristocratic background.

Now the eldest child of Sir Malcolm Colquhoun is quite literally trading on her heritage – by selling herself for sex.

Miss Colquhoun, 37, alludes to her blue blood on explicit websites where she advertises herself as a £140-an-hour ‘escort’ under the name Charlie Foxtrot – claiming her public school education makes her even more desirable.

And the mother-of two has posted photographs of her Old Etonian father, her titled grandfather, the family crest – even her birth certificate – on her Facebook page, alongside intimate photographs of herself semi-naked.

Confronted about her work, Miss Colquhoun told the Daily Mail: 'I’m sure my father would have a fit if he found out.'

Father: Charlotte is the daughter of Sir Malcolm Colquhoun, who owns a 40,000 acre estate and two public schools

Sir Malcom, 65, who owns two private schools in London and a 40,000-acre country estate, fathered Miss Colquhoun when he was 28, after a fling with interior designer Susan Armstrong.

He went on to marry twice – first to an American in 1978, while his current wife Katharine is Australian – but kept in touch with his first child and funded her schooling, even after producing an heir, Patrick, now 32.

Only more recently did they became estranged after she went through a series of crises.

Miss Colquhoun said: ‘I had a very good relationship with my father when I was younger, but through one thing and another I ended up having children very young and I got myself into quite a lot of trouble and a few messes.

'But eventually I managed to turn my 
life around and I wanted to wipe the slate clean and start afresh with 
him. I just want to have a normal father-daughter relationship with him 
and to be included in family life.'

Speaking
 at his London home last night, Sir Malcolm told our reporter: ‘She is a
 sad individual. She has a lot of problems and she only has herself to 
blame.’

Miss Colquhoun, who
 entertains paying customers at her cottage home in the sleepy village 
of Eardisley in Herefordshire, bills herself as an ‘English rose’ 
courtesan, claiming to offer the ‘ultimate girlfriend experience’.

She has posed for a string of naked and topless shots on escort websites. In one more modest image she stares seductively into the distance, posing in a gold and silver mask and lacy black lingerie.

Miss Colquhoun says men can visit her for sex for £90 for half-an-hour, and says she will visit hotels for four-hour sessions at £500.

She also says she will have group sex with men and women, and will agree to be filmed having sex.

In her profile blurb she boasts: ‘You will impressed by my professionalism, attractiveness, intoxicating personality and unique seductive sexiness, having been well educated at boarding school to set me up in the art of intelligent conversation for any occasion.’

She also reveals she lost her virginity in a barn aged 16, and refers to ‘making love on a yacht’.

Miss Colquhoun added: ‘I have some very nice clients, they’re respectable working men and I’m just providing a service like anybody else. Why not make money from it?

‘I’m very, very good at what I do. I make a lot of money, I support my way of life and I have dogs and race horses.’

Sir Malcolm, whose baronetcy dates from 1786, inherited the title from his father in 2008.

His family seat is the stunning Rossdhu House on the banks of Loch Lomond in Scotland, currently the home of the exclusive Loch Lomond Golf Club which leases the land from the estate. The Luss Estate – which includes villages and holiday parks – attracts millions of tourists every year.

Sir Malcolm also owns the £16,000-a-year Broomwood Hall and Northcote Lodge schools in South London.

In 1975 he hit the headlines when he and girlfriend Miss Armstrong, then 25, were arrested in the first class cabin of a Pan Am jet en route from Paris to Australia, by detectives investigating a £10million stolen plane ticket scam.

He was later charged with receiving stolen plane tickets worth £4,000, but cleared of any crime.

Of his errant daughter, Sir Malcolm said: ‘I feel very sorry for this woman. She clearly has a number of problems, all of which are of her own making.’

A close friend of Miss Colquhoun said last night: ‘There are a lot of people who care about her and she must stop this. It’s a very cheap way to earn a living and unbecoming of someone with her ancestry.’

The Colquhoun family crest features the French words: 'Si je puis' which translates to 'if I can.'

The
 name of Colquhoun is taken from an area of land around Kilpatrick near 
Loch Lomond which was granted to Humphrey of Kilpatrick by Malcolm, by 
the Earl of Lennox, in the 13th century.

It is thought that it was his grandson Ingram who decided to change his title to Ingram of Colquhoun.

The name and its derivations are now in 
use all over the world and include Cowan, Kirkpatrick, Kilpatrick, 
Ingram, McLintockm, Calhoon and Cahoon.

In
 around 1368 Robert the 5th of Colquhoun married a woman known only as 
the 'fair maid of Luss', the daughter of the 6th Laird of Luss.

As she was the heir this had the effect of uniting the estates from that point onwards.

In 1603 the Colquhouns clashed with the MacGregors in the most dramatic event in their history at the battle of Glen Fruin.

It
 is believed that as many as 140 Colquhouns died in the bloody conflict 
which saw them trapped by around 400 MacGregors who supposedly lost only
 two members during the conflict.

The
 Clan's first home was built around the 16th century on the west bank of
 Loch Lomond and was a four story defensive fort was visited by Mary 
Queen of Scots and called Rossdhu Castle.

In
 the later half of the 18th century Sir James the 23rd of Colquhoun 
build a new house within sight Rossdhu Castle called Rossdhu House.

His son James later added to it and the building became what is now Loch Lomond golf Club.
