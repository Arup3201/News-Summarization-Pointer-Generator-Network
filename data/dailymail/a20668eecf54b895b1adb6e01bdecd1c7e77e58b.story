This CCTV footage is the last image of a Good Samaritan who was beaten to death by a young mother and two thugs after he tried to act as a peacemaker when his friend was confronted.

Steven Herbert, 34, was on his way home in Hull on New Year's Day when he was horrifically attacked by the trio, who had been bragging online about drunken violence prior to the incident.

The popular chef and father-of-two had been trying to stop the trio confronting his friend when he was punched to the ground and repeatedly kicked until he fell unconscious.

Mr Herbert had been walking home with his friend in the morning of New Year's Day when the gang approached them. 

The court heard how the chef put his hands up to the trio in a conciliatory way and told them, 'Come on now, it's New Year's Eve'.

However, Samuel Jordan, who had been posting photos of himself posing and drinking on Facebook just hours earlier, punched the 'gentle giant' - knocking him to the ground.

Jordan, 22, had also posted images of himself pointing a plastic gun at his head and flexing his muscles while topless with the caption that he was bound for 'jail or the cemetery', prior to the incident. 

One of his accomplices, Soul Humphries, 22 - a rapper who performs under the name 'Konflikt' - helped to beat Mr Herbert unconscious.

Then, as the chef lay on the ground defenceless with his eyes glazed over, their female sidekick Tiffany Clark, 23, straddled him and repeatedly hit him in the face before kicking him in the head.

Mr Herbert died from severe brain injuries sustained in the attack and the three were yesterday jailed for life for his murder. 

The trio were sentenced at Hull Crown Court after being found guilty last month of his death.

Jordan was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars while Clark must serve 14 years and Humphries 13-and-a-half years.

Mr Herbert left behind partner Kim Field, 32, and their two young daughters, Courtney, 13, and Ellie, nine.

Sentencing the trio, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'This is a tragic case, mainly because of the loss of Mr Herbert's life, but the damage goes much deeper.

'It affects his long-term partner, his two children and his many friends. Steven Herbert, 34, was the father of two girls.

'This was pointless, public night-time violence on what should have been a night of joy and celebrations.'

Devastated Miss Field has told of her shock at a young mother being responsible for ripping a family apart.

She asked: 'How can a woman do something like that?

'How? She's a mum herself yet she didn't care about how my children would feel without a dad.

'When I picture Steven lying there in the street, I see her on top of him hitting him while he lay defenceless.

'Those three animals will never know what they have taken away from us. They didn't see my children's tears when I took them to the cemetery for Father's Day where they talked to a headstone instead of their dad.

'They didn't see Ellie having only Steven's picture to kiss to say thank you for every birthday present she got this year.

'Steven was perfect. No one ever had a bad word to say about him. He was just such a lovable man who touched the hearts of everyone he met.

'Life without him is like having my right arm cut off, nothing will ever be the same. He was my first and only boyfriend. We started dating when I was 14 and he was 15. We were a couple for so long that everything I now do without him is for the first time.

'Nothing would have been good enough, whether it was 15 years or a hundred years, but we have some sort of justice for Steven.

'I'm feeling devastated, heartbroken, every emotion possible.'

Miss Field said she treasures the final photo of the couple together, which was taken at a New Year's Eve party with close friends just hours before his murder.

After seeing in 2014, Mr Herbert headed to a pub with a friend while his wife stayed behind to continue chatting.

On his way home at about 6am, Mr Herbert encountered the gang, who had been trying to start rows with innocent strangers in Hull City centre weeks earlier and were again hell-bent on a fight.

Jordan, who had a violent criminal record, had only been released from prison in November.

Popular Mr Herbert has been described by friends and family as a 'gentle giant with a generous spirit'

He was jailed for four and a half years in 2009 for being part of a gang which tried to behead a man with a decorative samurai sword during a burglary.

Prior to the incident, he posted a photo of himself swigging whisky from the bottle with the caption: 'Drowning sorrows :( '

Humphries, meanwhile, had been bragging on Twitter about his fights in the city centre.

He wrote: 'U know what, i was in pub, one lad 2 times the size of me started, night night silly *******.

'Goes to the taxi rank, another lad swang for me missed, night night silly *******. loooool.

'Next thing you know im on the floor in town, cuffed, 4 coppers with tazers surroundin me. thought i was gettin tazered looool.

'Let away no fine nothin, so jus chillin;)'

He added: 'The worst is im cheeky wid it, il beat you then try move your mum or sister'.

In the days before the murder, the pair spoke about 'saving themselves' ready for their New Year's Eve night out.

And Humphries asked Jordan: 'Where we terrorisin?'

Jordan posted: '2014 I'm gunner get so f***** up I wake up in 2015!!!'

And Clark replied: 'Hahahha DITTO! x' 

Following the murder, Miss Field had to identify her partner's body and tell their two young daughters he had been killed.

She recalled: 'I wasn't even allowed to kiss him goodbye. They both started screaming when I told them Steven was dead.

The trio were sentenced at Hull Crown Court (above) after being found guilty of murder. Jordan was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars while Clark must serve 14 years and Humphries 13-and-a-half years

'Ellie was screaming "I want Daddy" and Courtney was saying "no Mummy, no".

'In the weeks afterwards they were really frightened. They kept begging me not to go out on my own.

'They thought if something like that could happen to their dad, their hero, the man who looked so big and strong to them, then it could happen to anyone.'

Miss Field said that it was 'living torture' seeing Clark's lack of remorse during the trial. Clark claimed that she only kicked Mr Herbert 'to get his attention'.

She said: 'She just sat there and scowled at all the witnesses.

'After killing Steven, one of them boasted on Facebook that they had blind-sided him during the attack. Listening to that knocked me ill.

'Steven was just doing what Steven did, trying to protect other people.

'I can imagine him standing there putting up his hands and trying to calm things down.

'He was such a generous spirit and our kids adored him.

'It's good that we got justice for Steven, but it's not going to bring back the love of my life.'

'I know he would want me to be happy and he'd want me to be strong for the girls, but everything is so hard now he's not here.

'Those animals will never know the hurt they have caused. I don't think they would even care if they did.'
