Where do you find the space to harvest rice in a city of more than 4million people?

On the roof of your house, according to one Chinese farmer.

Peng Qiugen has transformed the rooftop of his four-storey house in Shaoxing in east China's Zhejiang province into a fertile farmland.

Efficient: He grows, rice, vegetables and other crops on the 120-square-metre paddy, which sits more than 40 feet above the ground

Hard-working: The farmer has dedicated months to harvesting his produce since completing the rooftop conversion several years ago. Above, a local helps Mr Qiugen harvest his crops

As well as rice, he grows watermelons, vegetables and other crops on the 120-square-metre paddy, which sits more than 40 feet above the ground.

His unusual creation has drawn the attention of locals in the overcrowded city - with many offering to help Mr Qiugen harvest his crops.  

It also appears to have solved a difficult conundrum faced by many
countries around the world - how to produce enough food for an 
ever-increasing population when land and space is rapidly running out.

Bumper harvest: The farmland has boasted an impressive harvest year on year - producing a 30 per cent higher yield than is expected on ground-level land

Despite its alternative appearance, Mr Qiugen's rice paddy has boasted an impressive harvest year on year, according to China Daily.

It has produced a 30 per cent higher yield than is expected on ground-level land - with a staggering 400kg of watermelons grown on the roof in 2012 alone. 

And this year, the farmland's produce is reportedly sufficient enough to feed an adult for a whole year.

However, despite its success, agricultural experts have warned that people should seek out professional advice before attempting to cultivate farmlands on top of their homes.

It is not the first time a novel creation has been erected in Shaoxing, which has a population of about 4.3million people.

Earlier this year, the world's longest and widest multi-pylon cable-stayed bridge was opened in the city - which is situated 200km south-east of Shanghai - following seven years of construction work. 

The Jiaxing-Shaoxing Sea Bridge, which stretches 6.2miles over the Hangzhou Bay, is supported by two cable towers - each one towering a whopping 745ft in the air.

It is designed for vehicles travelling exclusively above 60mph - with pedestrians, motorbikes and cars with a maximum speed below 45mph not allowed to cross.
