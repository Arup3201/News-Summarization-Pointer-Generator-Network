She might be just one year old but Sweden's Princess Leonore, who celebrates her first birthday today, is well on her way to emulating her mother's stellar sense of style.

New photos of the toddler, which were released to mark her big day, show her perched in a gilt-edged arm chair and wearing a delicate rose-pink dress.

Her besotted mother, 32-year-old Princess Madeleine, captioned the pictures: 'Leonore, our little sunshine turns 1 year old today!'

Celebrating: Little Princess Leonore of Sweden celebrates her first birthday today

Leonore's birthday comes at the start of a busy year for the Swedish royals, with 2015 set to include a royal wedding and the arrival of a little brother or sister for the one-year-old.

In December, Madeleine, who is fourth-in-line to the Swedish throne, announced she was expecting a second child with her husband, British businessman Christopher O'Neill.

Speaking in a statement released by the Sveriges Kungahus, or Swedish Royal Court, the parents-to-be said they were 'very happy' and looking forward to the birth.

Unlike Princess Leonore, who was born in New York's Weill Cornell Medical Center, the new baby will be born in Stockholm following her parents' move to the city last summer.

The birth is likely to coincide with another big royal event, the wedding of Madeleine's older brother, Prince Carl Philip, 35, on the 13th June.

His bride-to-be, 30-year-old Sofia Hellqvist, is a former glamour model - a career that was the source of controversy when the couple's relationship was made public in January 2010.

Ms Hellqvist is expected to become Princess Sofia of Sweden following the wedding, although her title will not be officially decided until the ceremony.

Having posed topless in Swedish men's magazines, Ms Hellqvist hit tabloid headlines in 2005 after reaching the final of the scandalous sex and alcohol-fuelled TV show Paradise Hotel.

The shows sees five men and five women stay in a hotel together and included a scene in which Sofia was shown kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson.

However, in 2009, after she met Carl Philip, who is third in line to the throne, in a club, she has softened her image.

The relationship was controversial for a time, as Queen Silvia apparently did not entirely approve of the match.

But it is the prince himself who has the most colourful past, with his 'Wild Summer' of 2012 still referenced by Sweden's tabloid press which delightedly documented his antics.

As well as going on a drunken rampage in central Stockholm while wearing an alien mask, the summer also saw him become the victim of a happy slapping incident during a holiday to Cannes.

He also, following a wild night out, managed to lose his wallet and was forced to hitch-hike to the motor race he was due to compete in, before spectacularly crashing his car on the first lap. 

As the only son of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, the prince was the heir to the throne for a seven months after he was born in May 1979.

But in January 1980 the rules were changed and the principle of primogeniture was introduced, meaning the throne will be inherited by the monarch's eldest child, Crown Princess Victoria.

She will be succeeded by her daughter Estelle, who was born in February 2012.
