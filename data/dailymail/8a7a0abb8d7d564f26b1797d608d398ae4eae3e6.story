Inspirational: Victoria Rathmill has become the world¿s youngest stem cell donor

At the age of just 16, Victoria Rathmill has become the world’s youngest stem cell donor.

The British schoolgirl was spurred on to donate her cells after a family friend was tragically diagnosed with leukaemia earlier this year.

Without her parents knowledge the A-level pupil signed up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in February when she was just 16.

In just a few months she was 
identified as a perfect match to a patient suffering from blood cancer 
and made a donation at a London Clinic last month.

This
selfless act made the teenager from Macclesfield, Cheshire, the 
youngest ever person in the world to provide stem cells to a 
non-relative.

Miss 
Rathmill, who is now 17 said: ‘At first I was like: "I’ll join when I’m 
18, I’m not going to make any difference", but then a friend of our 
family got ill and so I felt the need to join up.’

The All Hallows Catholic College student confessed that she did not tell her surprised parents about her plan to donate.

She
said: ‘It was only a couple of weeks after I signed up that I told my 
mum. Anthony Nolan sent the spit kit out to me and she asked me what it 
was.

‘Though she was taken aback a bit at first, she thought it was a nice thing to do, especially given our friend’s experience.’

After registering with the charitable organisation the youngster received a phone call in October- just six months later- telling her that she had been matched to a patient.

‘After I signed up I just stopped thinking about it really. You just don’t expect to get the phone call within six months of registering,’ she said.

She added: ‘It’s quite shocking to think I’m the youngest-ever - you’re never the first to do anything nowadays, it’s all been done already.’ Miss Rathmill revealed that she would happily donate again describing the process as being similar to giving blood.

She said: ‘It’s just like giving blood really. I would do it again because it’s not that difficult. It’s just a couple of days out of your life to save somebody else’s - and I got a free trip to London.’

The teenager’s proud mother Paula described her daughter as being a headstrong and determined individual.

She said: ‘It never really occurred to me to try and stop her from helping another person in their hour of need. It makes me very proud.

‘Yet even though she’s strong, what she’s doing takes courage and she’s still only 17. I didn’t want her to feel bad if it doesn’t work out for the patient, which it might not.

‘But she’s level-headed and after having gone through the donation process, she knows she couldn’t have done anymore.’ Mrs Rathmill has now urged other parents to encourage their children to donate their cells.

She added: ‘To others who go through this I would say look it up, get involved and then encourage your child as much as you can.

‘I personally feel you have to trust your children to make the right decisions.

‘While it’s up to each family to decide for themselves, the question I asked myself was ‘what if Victoria was ill and a 17-year-old donor could help save her life?’ If the boot was on the other foot, I know what I would want.’

The charity’s bone marrow register is just one of two in the world that accept under-18 donors.

Anthony Nolan chief executive Henny Braund said the teenagers’ donation was ‘genuinely impressive.’

He added: ‘It shows both what a special young woman she is, and how teenagers can be sufficiently mature, caring and engaged with the world around them to help save an unwell stranger.’
