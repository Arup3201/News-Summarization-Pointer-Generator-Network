Tony Blair has risked sparking sparking further controversy after helping poverty-stricken Albania take a step towards joining the European Union

The former Prime Minister has been widely criticised for his decision to open Britain borders to eastern European immigration in 2004 - allowing some 669,000 workers to settle in the UK.

But Mr Blair has defended the decision and has been working to help the formerly Communist Albania be allowed into the club as well.

Mr Blair and his former spin chief Alastair Campbell forged strong links with Albania during the 1999 Kosovo war and last year became an unpaid consultant for the country.

The Balkan nation has overcome concerns about endemic corruption and organised crime to be named an official candidate in Brussels.

EU leaders today formally signed off the decision to allow Albania to start the process of preparing its application to join. Albania has failed to win the coveted status three times since 2009.

Edi Rama, 49, the socialist prime minister, posed for a celebration selfie in the country's capital Tirana with Mr Campbell, which the ex-Downing Street communications chief posted on Twitter.

Albania was isolated from Europe until 1985 while under the leadership of hardline Communist ruler Enver Hoxha. It only began to emerge as a democracy in 1991.

Mr Campbell, a paid consultant, said: 'I have been offering advice, strategy, that sort of thing and just making sure that whenever I see people who are decision-makers anywhere in Europe I just try to break down some of the myths about Albania which have a powerful hold.'

He was in Tirana when EU foreign ministers agreed to recommend Albania for candidate status on Tuesday.

Mr Blair congratulated the country on his Facebook page, adding he had met Mr Rama last week. 'This follows the country’s continued efforts to reform and is a credit to its government and its people.'

Albania is one of Europe's poorest countries - with a population of 3.2 million earning on average 10 times less than workers in Britain.

While Britain has historically supported EU expansion, David Cameron has vowed to veto Albania's membership unless new rules are introduced to immigration.

Mr Cameron has made clear that he will block any attempt to allow Albania to formally join the 28-nation bloc without new limits on freedom of movement.

Countries including Britain and Germany have made clear it will not be allowed to proceed without further efforts to tackle corruption and the introduction of an independent judiciary.

However, Downing Street today made clear that the it will use its veto to block further expansion of the EU without new rules to prevent migrants from new, poorer countries moving to the UK in search of work.

A Number 10 source said: ‘It is absolutely clear that before Albania can ever join, the long-term transitional arrangements would have to apply. If they don’t, we won’t let them in. End of story.’

Mr Cameron is pushing the idea of new countries having to reach a set level of income per head before the borders are opened to the rest of the EU.

It follows concerns about the influx of people from countries like Poland, and more recently Bulgaria and Romania, when they joined the EU.

The prospect of EU expansion has emerged for the first time since the European Parliament elections, in which support surged for Eurosceptic parties.

Mr Cameron believes the introduction of controls on freedom of movement for new controls could be a major gain in his plan to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister set out that all and any future accessions would have to be the subject of the new transitional controls that he wants to see, and that would apply to all and any future cases.

‘This is not a decision on accession, it’s a decision to at some point in the future, it could be several years down the line, this is the beginning of any negotiations.

‘There is a period of negotiations that in some countries’ cases has taken decades, any final decision, at the end of that process requires unanimity, and the Prime Minister is very clear the new transitional requirements he wants to see would have to apply to any and all future accessions.’

Albania will not be allowed to progress in joining the EU without major reforms on the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking.

As well as Britain, other countries taking a hardline stance include Holland, Germany, France, the Czech Republic and Spain.

In a statement, the EU said Albania had to address issues such as the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said that, with the EU's decision, Albania had 'regained its lost dignity in the eyes of international partners.'

'It was not an easy job, Europe is not a door that opens easily. After the (European) elections, things could have gone in another direction. The reason I am thankful to European leaders ... is that they stood by the project of Europe,' he told reporters in the Albanian capital Tirana.
