A Las Vegas dancer on trial for the murder of his ex-girlfriend cried in court on Thursday as he showed the jury how she had died in his arms while he was trying to talk to her.

Jason Omar Griffith claims he had been trying to defend himself as he and Deborah Flores Narvaez struggled during an altercation at his home in December 2010.

He accused Ms Flores, a dancer from the racy Fantasy revue, of being abusive and said he feared she was reaching for a gun when he grabbed hold of her.

Ms Flores had gone to his studio apartment to watch Dexter, the TV series about a serial killer, on the night she disappeared.

Her dismembered and decomposing body was found encased in concrete tubs inside a vacant house, in January 2011.

Describing her as violent and possessive, he claimed that the dancer had threatened him and assaulted him.

Griffith told the court no one had taken 
him seriously when he tried to report Ms Flores for stalking and 
harassing him after they began a relationship earlier in the year.

On the night that she died, Griffith claimed that he was trying to stop her reaching a purse, which he thought contained a gun.

'I think she's reaching for the gun in her purse, but I have no way to know. I was telling her to stop. I pull her back toward me,' he said.

Griffith, a dancer in the Cirque du Soleil, showed the jury how Ms Flores' head had become wedged in his elbows as he fell backwards on the floor of his studio apartment.

'She says, "I'm going to [expletive] 
kill you. I'm going to [expletive] kill you",' Griffith said, adding that she was kicking him with the high heels of her boots and threw her head back against his nose as he held her.

Claiming that he was pleading with her to stop, Griffith said: 'I thought she was listening to me, because she wasn't moving anymore. She wasn't scratching me, or gasping for air.'

Moments later, he claimed, he realized she wasn't breathing at all.

Their fight had allegedly been because Ms Flores wanted him to stop seeing another dancer. He said she had claimed to be pregnant, but a medical examiner said there was no evidence to support this.

Jurors were also played 14 calls that Griffith made to 911, accusing Ms Flores of assault.

The dancer claimed the police response had been that 'a beautiful girl cannon be dangerous'.

On
 Friday, the prosecution is due to question Griffith about the 
differences in what he told the jury and the denials he made to police 
after Ms Flores disappeared.

The
 35-year-old has acknowledged lying to police, and said he hid details 
of the killing from everyone, including his housemate Louis Colombo, who
 testified that he helped dispose of the victim's body.

Griffith has pleaded not guilty 
to first-degree murder, and his defense, Jeff Banks, says the dancer was acting in self-defense.

Offended: Celeste Flores Narvaez, refuted claims in court on May 8 that her sister had been the aggressor in the relationship

'They will show you pictures, and they 
will be gruesome and they will be shocking,' Banks said during the opening statements on May 8.

'But that does 
not change the fact ... that he was scared and he was afraid that she 
was violent, and Jason Griffith was defending himself on December 12, 2010.'

Griffith is accused of choking Ms Flores and asphyxiating her with a plastic bag over her head before trying to dispose of her body in tubs of cement.

The jury has already heard from Ms Flores’ roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg, who testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith’s house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer - and never returned.

After finding her dismembered body in a vacant house, police finally cracked the disappearance-turned-homicide case when they gave Griffith's housemate, Colombo, immunity from prosecution.

Colombo told police he left the house after seeing Griffith put his hands around Flores' neck as they argued. When he returned, he could see Flores was dead.

A friend, Kalae Casorso, told police that Griffith admitted to her that Ms Flores was in the huge tub of cement he and Colombo tried to store at her house.
