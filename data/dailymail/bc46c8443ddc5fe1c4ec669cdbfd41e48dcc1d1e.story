Beleaguered Carnival Cruises has replaced its CEO after 34 years following a string of publicity nightmares, including one trip where passengers were stranded without working toilets for five days.

Despite the media grilling, the company's second quarter profits tripled year-on-year to $41 million - but even that stellar performance didn't save Micky Arison, who is being ousted in favor of long-time board member Arnold W. Donald.

Arison, the son of Carnival co-founder Ted Arison, took the helm in 1979 and will remain on the board after his departure from the top spot. He also owns the Miami Heat basketball team, and was criticized for attending a game while the Triumph crisis was ongoing.

The shake up comes as passengers remain hesitant to book cruises with the Miami-based business.

But lower fuel costs and the timing of some administrative expenses saw Carnival's profit jump up from $14 million for the same period last year, a quarter which it suffered from steep losses on fuel prices bets known as derivatives.

Arison led the company through an aggressive expansion that included the acquisition of several brands, including Holland America, Costa Cruises, Cunard and Seabourn. In 2003, he oversaw a merger between Carnival Corp. and P&O Princess Cruises. Today, Carnival runs cruises under 10 brands.

However, Arison came under fire during Carnival's bad publicity earlier in the year when a string of its cruise ships suffered through mechanical problems and fires.

The most dramatic of them was the 
Carnival Triumph where passengers were stranded at sea for five days as 
toilets backed up and air conditioners failed. There were media reports 
of raw sewage seeping through walls and carpets.

Donald founded and led Merisant, a 
company whose products include sweetener brands Equal and Canderel. He 
also held multiple senior management roles at Monsanto over the course 
of 20-plus years, including president of the company's consumer and 
nutrition sector and president of its agricultural sector.

The Triumph nightmare was followed up with problems on three other Carnival ships - The Elation, Dream and Legend - all which made big headlines.

None of that helped restore 
confidence in vacationers who are still wary after the January 2012 
sinking of the Costa Concordia, also owned by Carnival.

In its earnings release Tuesday, 
Carnival said that advance bookings for the rest of 2013 are running 
behind last year's levels, even at lower prices. Bookings on its 
namesake Carnival line are particularly weak.

Arison said in a statement that Carnival is working to market the 'truly exceptional vacation values' that cruises offer through travel agents and other industry partners.

'We believe these initiatives, combined with slower supply growth, will lead to increased yields,' he said. 'In addition, we remain focused on reducing our fuel dependence. By year end, we will achieve a 23 percent cumulative reduction in fuel consumption since 2005 and expect our research and development efforts in fuel saving technologies to continue to bear fruit.'

Those fuel-savings efforts seem to be paying off. In the quarter that ended May 31, the company saw a 14-percent drop in its fuel bill. The company spent $555 million on fuel, down from $645 million during the same quarter last year.

Cruise companies, airlines and other large consumers of fuel typically make bets, called derivatives, on the price of oil to hedge again any sudden spikes. Last year, Carnival lost $145 million in the second quarter on such bets. This year, that loss was narrowed to $31 million.

During the second quarter, the company took delivery of Princess Cruises' 3,560-passenger Royal Princess, the first of a new class of ships for Princess. Additionally, Carnival Sunshine entered service in May following a $155 million modernization.

Shares of Carnival rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $34.33 in morning trading, following the impressive results.

Earnings totaled of 5 cents per share, up from 2 cents a share last year at this time. Revenue fell 1.7 percent to $3.48 billion.

Excluding one-time items, Carnival's earnings were 9 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 6 cents per share on revenue of $3.56 billion.

February 10, 2013 Carnival Triumph, with 3,143 passengers aboard, suffered an engine room fire, leaving the ship adrift for five days in the Gulf of Mexico. Toilets backed up and air conditioners failed. There were media reports of raw sewage seeping through walls and carpets. The ship was towed to Mobile, Alabama, docking on the evening of February 14.

March 14, 2013 Carnival Dream experienced an emergency generator failure while docked in port at Philipsburg, St. Maarten. The ship was scheduled to leave port around 5 p.m. ET the day before. The United States Coast Guard said they were notified by Carnival that Carnival Dream was experiencing emergency generator problems. Carnival announced that the passengers would be flown back to Florida rather than completing their scheduled voyage.

March 15, 2013 Carnival Legend suffered a mechanical problem with one propulsion pod while at sea. The cruise line cancelled Carnival Legend's scheduled stops in Belize and Grand Cayman, and the ship returned to Tampa, Florida at a reduced speed of 19 knots.
