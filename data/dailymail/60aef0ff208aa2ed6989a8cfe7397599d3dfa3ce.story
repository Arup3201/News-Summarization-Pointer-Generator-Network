Fed up of sickly sweet flavoured ice creams? 

Well, you're in luck because the UK’s first savoury ice cream parlour opens in London this week and aims to offer a gourmet experience for those who like their summer snacks a little less ‘vanilla’.

The pop-up promises to combine the UK’s favourite summer treat with a savoury twist - think blue cheese, cream cracker, ale and twiglet flavoured ice cream. 

Sick of the sweet stuff? A new savoury ice cream parlour is opening its doors in London this week - and smoked salmon, cream cracker and cheese flavoured ice cream is on the menu

All the flavours on offer are made using Jacob’s savoury snacks, including Twiglets and Mini Cheddars and, even better, they’ll be free to all visitors. 

A spokesperson for Jacob's, who are behind the concept, said: 'Jacob’s is always looking for ways to bring its flavours to people in new ways, but I never thought I would see the day when we would be serving a Jacob’s Cream Cracker with ice cream.

'Having previewed the flavours during production I can guarantee that anyone who visits us is in for a real treat.'

Yum? The store, created by Jacobs, will use some of their snacks such as mini cheddars and even twiglets to create the savoury ice cream

The store, which is located in Soho, will also crowdsource a flavour via suggestions made on Twitter. 

Savoury ice creams are having a moment over in the U.S., where chorizo combined with caramel, and cherry-miso flavoured dessert is all the rage.

'I like the marriage of salty and sweet and savoury and sweet,' Sam Mason of OddFellows Ice Cream Co. in Brooklyn told Today.com.

'There is a large segment of people who want something new and exciting that they’ve never had before or would have never thought possible in ice cream form, and I like challenging those people to try it.' 

Salt and Straw in Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, serves up a black raspberry and smoked ham flavour, as well as pear with blue cheese and goat cheese with habanero. 

Bizarre: OddFellows Ice Cream Co. in Brooklyn, New York, offer all sorts of savoury snacks, including Guinness flavoured, left, and even foie gras, right 

Ingredients

DIY: Blue Cheese & Jacob's Cream Cracker Ice Cream Sandwiches

Method

1. Pour the cream, milk and sugar into a saucepan. Bring slowly to the boil then remove from the heat and allow to cool a little.

2. Whisk together the salt and egg yolks in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.

3. Slowly pour the slightly cooled milk and cream onto the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Do not use boiling milk as this can turn your egg mixture into scrambled eggs.

4. Pour the mixture back into the pan and slowly heat, stirring with a wooden spoon continuously, until it has reached 85C (185F).

5. Add the cubed stilton to the saucepan and stir over a low to medium heat until it has all melted. Remove from the heat.

6. Taste and season with lemon juice and a little salt or pepper if necessary.

7. Cool down to 4C (39F) within 90 minutes. To do this, either place the mix in a pan in a sink with cold water and ice cubes, or put the mix in a Ziploc bag inside a pan of cold water with ice cubes.

8. Pour the mixture into an ice-cream maker and churn. Scoop the churned ice cream into a container and allow it to firm up a little before you start assembling your cream cracker sandwiches.

9. Once your ice cream is a little firmer, take it out of the freezer and scoop two generous tablespoons onto one Cream Cracker, season with a good twist of black pepper, and sandwich with a second Cracker. Press down, and use a palette knife to smooth around the edges for a clean finish.

10. Have your packaging - either the plastic tub or some waxed paper - ready, and place each sandwich back in the freezer quickly to firm up before serving.
