Queen Letizia looked the picture of sophistication as she stepped out  today with her husband King Felipe.

Wearing an eye-catching red jacket, which toned perfectly with her husband's deep red tie, the Spanish beauty was every inch the royal style icon as she attended the 75th anniversary of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid.

The stylish royal paired the colour-pop jacket with straight-leg, black trousers, smart court shoes and a printed top.

In her hand she held a red statement clutch bag  and dangling from her ears were a pair of dazzling rubies.

But that's where the scarlet theme ended for the 42-year-old Queen. Her lips were a more subtle dark berry shade and her nails appeared polish-free.

The  couple were joined at the event by the Spanish minister of the Economy and Finance, Luis de Guindos, who joined them for a chat in the auditorium before the event began.

The Spanish National Research Council, where the couple made their appearance, is the largest public institution dedicated to research in Spain and the third largest in Europe.

Since becoming Queen in June this year, Letizia has become known as one of the world's most stylish royals

The institute's aim is to develop and promote research and encourage scientific and technological progress. 

It also manages an extensive network of specialist libraries and has research centres spread around the country.

Since taking the throne in June this year, Letizia and Felipe have been busy with their official duties. 

Between them they've already visited France, Morocco and Holland as well as attending many high profile events at home.

Of course, as parents of Princess Leonor, eight, and Princess Sofia, seven, they have a  young family to keep them occupied too.
