A 13-year-old girl who has been missing for nearly two months is believed to be with an older man in Sydney's western suburbs.

Jazmin Deacon, 13, has not been seen or heard from since August 26, when she disappeared from Blacktown.

But photos on her Facebook page that were published on September 29 show her travelling with an older man at Kingswood, in Sydney's outer west.

Police say they have serious concerns for Jazmin Deacon, as she is believed to be in the company of an older man

Ms Deacon has been active on her social media pages in recent weeks

Police say they have serious concerns for Jazmin's safety given her age and suggestions she is with an older man. 

Meanwhile, in the Hunter region, police are trying to track down another underage missing girl. 

Police believe 16-year-old Taylor Almond is safe, but her family says her behaviour is completely out of character.

She has been seen at the Kotara, Adamstown area, and Newcastle Beach areas in the past week.
