A man who was exonerated after serving 27 years for a crime he did not commit has died suddenly following his arrest and imprisonment two months ago.

James Woodard, 60, was freed in Dallas in April 2008 after DNA tests proved he did not rape and murder his girlfriend Beverly Jones in 1980.

Woodard, who had always protested his innocence and was subsequently denied parole 12 times, was put back in jail in August after being arrested for cocaine possession.

Died in jail: James Woodard was exonerated of the rape and murder of his girlfriend after spending 27 years in Dallas County Jail but died in prison following his arrest in August

Police said there were also several outstanding warrants for his arrest.

This weekend, Mr Woodard, who suffered from seizures, was taken from Dallas County Jail to Parkland Hospital, where he died.

Cory Session, policy director for the Innocence Project of Texas who reopened Mr Woodard's case, told Dallas News: 'It’s a loss that we can’t get back and will definitely miss him.'

He added: 'The impact that he left will overshadow anything in his life.'

Mr Woodward was released in 2008 after members of the non-profit Innocence Project re-examined his case. 

His conviction was set aside after DNA testing showed he didn't commit 
the 1980 murder for which he had spent nearly three decades in prison - the longest time spent in jail for a prisoner before being exonerated. 

Following his release from prison, Mr 
Woodard donated $100,000 of his compensation from the state to the 
project so that they could continue to look for wrongful convictions.

Incarceration: Woodard was returned to the Dallas County Jail in August after serving 27 years for a crime he did not commit

Mr Session said that Mr Woodard's health had suffered after his decades of incarceration.

The Dallas County Jail said it was investigating the circumstances of Mr Woodard's death and that an autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday.

Funeral arrangements have not yet been made.

James Woodward was sentenced to life in prison at the age of 28 for the rape and murder of his girlfriend. He had been convicted by legendary Texas prosecutor Henry Wade who was known for his motto - 'convict at all costs'. 

In recent years, Wade's practices have been called into question - 15 people have been exonerated for their crimes using DNA evidence. Project Innocence Texas is currently examining 250 cases.
