Ahmad said: 'It was very heart-wrenching for me to see him struggle and not be able to help him. Two long nights watching him at the hospital made me cry.'

Ahmad reveals he had already lost a father and another sibling when his younger brother Mohammad was diagnosed with a 'germ cell tumour'.

He said: 'We lost two loved ones in two consecutive years (2011 and 2012), my dear father and brother. It was really painful for our family.

'Then, in 2013, we found out that my younger brother had a critical stage cancer called "germ cell tumour". From our conversation with the doctor, we learned that the cancer was considerable, blocking his kidneys and frontal stomach.'

Ahmad told how his brother was in constant pain because of his condition, which is clearly visible in the photos he took of him.

'It caused him constant pain even though the doctor had provided him with the strongest morphine,' Ahmad recalls.

'He was unable to lie on a bed to sleep even for a few minutes. Due to complications he could neither eat nor drink.

'A surgery to remove an infection left him in even more agony.'

Germ cell tumours mainly develop in the ovary or testicle but it can, on rare occasions, be found in other parts of the body. They tend to grow faster than other types of tumours and have a lower five year survival rate.

In the UK germ cell tumours generally respond very well to chemotherapy and most people are cured.

Ahmad had started the photo diary in the hope that it would end with his brother smiling and well on his motorbike, but he said it soon became clear he was not going to survive the disease.

Mohammad underwent one course of chemotherapy but his body too weak to attempt another course when it failed to stop the cancer.

Suffering: Ahmad Yusni's photo diary of his brother Mohammad's final days, pictured, lay bare his suffering and pain

He said: 'I lost hope that he would recover due to many complications.
 I found my prayers to God changing: "God, plaese stop his pain, even 
death is the only choice, I can't stand to see his suffering anymore".'

But he said his brother remained strong right up until the moment he died despite his awful suffering.

'Even through this long and painful battle, he said thank you to me and told me that he loved me,' Ahamd said.

'Deep in my heart, I felt he would leave us soon when he told me that our father and brother had called upon him for three consecutive nights to join the, in his dreams.

'Then, on an early Saturday morning, he left us forever. His heartbeat dropped dramatically. Although sad, the expression on his face showed that he had found a peaceful, deep sleep.'

As Mohammad had requested, the family laid him to rest beside his father and brother in the same cemetery.
