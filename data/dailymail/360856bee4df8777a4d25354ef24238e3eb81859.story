A 101-year-old woman who lived through the Great Depression received a standing ovation after giving a rousing 90-minute talk to an unemployment group.

Annie Murphy spoke without notes about a difficult childhood which saw her defy her alcoholic father's wishes to attend grammar school - a five-mile walk away each day - and train as a teacher.

The 30 job-seeking adult learners at Gateshead's Dryden Centre were so impressed she has now been nominated for a local award.

Ms Murphy's talk began with her childhood in Gateshead, where she was born in 1913.

She attended school aged five but her alcoholic father, who returned from the First World War with 'shell shock' - now known as post-traumatic stress disorder - wanted her at home.

When she turned 11 he tried to stop her attending the local grammar school, too.

'He wanted me at home looking after my four little brothers and my sister,' she said.

'But even though it involved a five mile walk and two train journeys every day, I was determined to be educated'.

Thanks to her endurance Ms Murphy earned the qualifications to embark on a two-year teacher training course in 1932.

But before she had the chance to begin her career, the Great Depression struck.

She was left having to search for work, and eventually secured a teaching position in Coxhoe, County Durham.

'I know what it's like when you can't find work through no fault of your own, and that's what I told them during my talk,' she said.

The talk also took in major events throughout her lifetime such as the miners' strike and the 27-year imprisonment of Nelson Mandela, who she described as one of her heroes.

The struggle for Ms Murphy did not end when she found a job, however. She told the adult learners she was angry that would have to give up her job if she found a husband.

That never happened, however - as in the same year that she met her future husband Michael, the Second World War broke out.

Because men were needed to fight overseas, she could continue teaching, albeit with a Â£1-a-week pay cut.

It meant she was lucky never to experience long-term unemployment again, and retired happily at the age of 60 after separating from her husband.

Ms Murphy's talk was arranged by a reminiscence group at the Addison Court Nursing Home where she lives in Crawcrook, Tyne and Wear.

Afterwards she said she had wanted to support people who were struggling to find work by sharing her experiences, having lived through war and the worst recessions of the 20th Century.

The home's activities co-ordinator Deb Carter said: 'Annie is just amazing. When she gave her talk, the audience were absolutely fascinated.

'Her memory is crystal clear and she brought events they'd only read about, to life. We are now hoping to line up more talks for her - she really is an inspiration.'

Ms Murphy has now been nominated for an award by a 'Workability Group' in the city, which helps find qualifications for people without a job.

The Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash in October 1929, when years of rapid growth and hedonistic wealth reached a sudden peak.

Images of distraught stock market traders hurling themselves from the newly-built skyscrapers of New York, days after the crash, became some of the most harrowing of the 20th Century.

In the U.S., almost half the country's banks failed and up to 15million were out of work - but the pain was also felt keenly in Britain.

By 1933 a quarter of the UK workforce was jobless.

The people of Jarrow, near Gateshead, even arranged a 'crusade' march on Westminster - whereupon they were told to go home and figure it out for themselves.

The Depression was only fully over once preparations began for the Second World War - an effort which cost millions and prompted an obvious boom in manufacturing.

It was often said to be the worst in British history, but many economists have suggested the current slump is worse.

Although the crash of 1929 was much more dramatic than that in 2008, analysis by Forbes suggests the economy picked up again more quickly afterwards.

British Gross Domestic Product has largely flatlined since the crash, according to the analysts - compared to the Depression where it lifted beyond the pre-1929 level after the worst was over.
