With the summer wedding season in full swing, it seems it isn't just brides and grooms having to stump up hefty amounts of cash for the celebrations - guests are finding themselves footing increasingly chunky bills, too.

The average British woman spends an average of £400 every time they attend a wedding as a guest, according to a study

Women tend to spend £210 on a wedding appropriate outfit - paying £100 for a dress and a further £50 on a pair of matching shoes. Vital accessories such as a clutch bag and jewellery cost an extra £60.

Many women even fork out £60 to get their hair and make-up done for the special event.

Appearance aside, accommodation adds to the pricey bill, with hotels costing £80 for the night. 

And a wedding gift for the happy couple - be it gifts for the home, a donation or a set of vouchers - sets most people back £50.

Being a close friend of the bride has obvious perks, but with that comes plenty of extra costs, 
mainly down to the pre-wedding celebrations - in particular, the hen 
party.

With
hen parties becoming more like holidays than the traditional 
'party the night before the wedding', women are likely to spend £300 for a
short getaway with the girls.

When asked about the general price of being a wedding guest, almost half of women quizzed agreed they would spend up to £400 on a friend's wedding, without any hesitation

However, when quizzed about the general price of being a wedding guest, almost half of women agreed they would spend up to £400 on a friend's wedding without any hesitation.

Dress: £100

Jewellery and accessories: £110

Hair and make-up: £60

Accommodation: £80

Presents: £50

Additional costs (hen parties): £300

Over two-thirds agreed that buying an outfit for the wedding worked out as the most expensive part.

One respondent commented: 'I love weddings, but the amount of saving you have to do beforehand is ridiculous. I was invited to two of my best friends' weddings in the same year and ended up spending £1000 in total.

'It seems like a lot, but once you have two outfits, accommodation and the hen party paid for, it does all add up. I didn't want to miss out on anything so I just made sure I saved way in advance.'

Another woman who took part in the survey said: 'I honestly think weddings are becoming way too extravagant and expensive, especially when you have a family to pay for.

'I ended up turning down a couple of weddings last year simply because we couldn't afford them. With all the travelling and the cost of finding somewhere to stay, it would have been £150 just to sort that out. All weddings seem to come at the same time as well.'

A spokesperson for PromotionalCodes.org.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'Weddings are sun and fun and exciting time for everyone, but they are definitely a very expensive occasion, especially for women.

'The best thing to do when you know you have an upcoming wedding is put a bit of money aside every week, that way you have your money at the ready when the costs come flying in.'
