Millions of families face rising mortgage interest rates that will add £300 a year to the cost of a £100,000 home loan.

The RBS-NatWest group is pushing up rates from 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent while Halifax, one of Britain's biggest lenders, followed suit by pushing its own home loan rate up from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent.

The increases come despite the Bank of England maintaining its base rate at just 0.5 per cent and will be met with fury by homeowners, who will see the moves as rank profiteering.

Rate rise fears: Other borrowers are braced for increases in mortgage rates after the hike at RBS-NatWest

It’s the fear factor in markets that drives up borrowing costs – even when the UK base rate remains unmoved.

The
 Bank of England has kept its key bank rate pinned down at 0.5 per cent 
for nearly three years in a bid to keep borrowing cheap for individuals 
and businesses.

However, 
banks also need to borrow from each other on money markets so that they 
have enough to lend out as loans and mortgages. Even money they have 
lent years before on mortgages needs to be ‘funded’ by borrowing fresh 
batches of money.

The rates on this inter-bank lending - known as LIBOR - are influenced by the fear factor in the markets.

The
 concerns about the Eurozone crisis in the second half of 2011 made 
banks suspicious of one another so the key LIBOR rate – the three-month 
sterling rate – steadily rose, up from 0.75 per cent at the start of 
2011 to 1.08 per cent by the end of the year.

Banks
 say they have largely absorbed the rising cost, but feel that they need
 to pass it on – despite the ‘Big Four’ making profits of more than 
£10bn from British High Street banking last year.

Recent
 intervention by the European Central Bank to dole out colossal, cheap 
loans to banks across the Continent appears to have stabilised these 
money markets and LIBOR has fallen marginally in recent weeks.

The
 most recent loans bonanza was earlier this week. RBS took around 
€5billion to add to a similar size European loan in December.

The rise by Halifax will affect around 850,000 households by driving up repayments on a £100,000 mortgage by £24.31 a month or just under £300 a year.

Yesterday it emerged that the 
RBS-NatWest group, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is 
increasing the rate charged to 200,000 of its customers to 4 per cent.

Other banks and building societies 
could now follow suit. Halifax is part of the giant Lloyds group, which 
also includes the Lloyds-TSB and Cheltenham & Gloucester brands.

The increases could not come at a 
worse time for hard-pressed families, who are struggling to make ends 
meet.

Just yesterday the price of petrol hit an all-time high, 
threatening to reverse recent falls in the headline rate of inflation.

The rate rises also amount to a 
significant slap in the face to taxpayers who supported banks such as 
Halifax through the banking crisis of 2008 but who are now suffering 
cuts, austerity and job losses.

Accusations of profiteering will be 
bolstered by official figures published earlier this week that revealed 
how the big banks have dramatically pushed up their profit margins on 
credit cards, overdrafts and other products.

At the same time, the Bank of England 
has kept its base rate at a record 300-year low and has also, since 
2009, poured a staggering £375billion of cheap money into the banking 
system through so-called  quantitative easing.

Sources close to the banks involved, 
however, claimed that the prices they are being charged to borrow money 
on the wholesale markets have risen in the past year and they have no 
choice but to pass the increase on to customers.

The banks also blame the rises on a need to offer better interest rates to savers.

RBS has already ordered the increase of 0.25 per cent to 4 per cent on its RBS and NatWest-branded offset mortgages

Homeowners sat on Halifax standard variable rate mortgages at 3.5 per cent received a rude shock, as the lender hiked their monthly payments.

The mortgage lending giant has an estimated 1 million borrowers paying its standard variable rate (SVR), many of whom will had reasoned that they are safe from having their rate jump as long as the UK base rate remains at its record 0.5 per cent low.

But Halifax’s recent move to lift a cap on its SVR meant a rate rise of almost 0.5 per cent for all.

A rise from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent would add £735 a year to the cost of a £150,000 interest-only mortgage.

One insider said: ‘The change acknowledges that the cost of funding a mortgage in today’s market has risen.

‘The increase to the rate reflects the
 fact that raising money through retail savings and in the wholesale 
markets is currently very expensive.’

Following the Halifax rise –
 which will take effect from May 1 – a customer with a 
£100,000 mortgage would see monthly repayments rise from £714.88 to 
£739.19.

The Consumer Credit Counselling Service said: ‘Households are being hit by a double whammy.

‘High interest rates and the squeeze 
on household budgets across the board are  combining to make it even 
harder for people to repay their debts, and many are  at risk of falling
 even further behind.’

Marc Gander, of campaigners the 
Consumer Action Group, said: ‘If consumers think that banks are 
suffering alongside them in this economic crisis, they really do not 
understand what is going on.’

The fall and rise of borrowing costs: The key rate of three-month sterling LIBOR - the interest rate banks charge each other for short term loans - fell from 6.3% in 2008 to a low of 0.50% in 2009 before steadily climbing to a peak of 1.08% at the start of 2012

Home buyers pay a ‘premium’ of nearly £50,000 to live in a spa town.

House prices in spa towns in England and Wales are around 27 per cent or £48,123 higher than neighbouring towns, averaging £275,397 last year.

Prices there have typically climbed £1,077 a month and nearly £130,000 overall since 2001, Lloyds TSB research shows.

Spa town homes now cost 8.3 times gross annual earnings.

Ilkley in West Yorkshire boasted the highest premium, at almost double the prices of surrounding areas.

Boston Spa, also in West Yorkshire, came second with an 85 per cent premium, followed by Bath in Somerset (53 per cent), Church Stretton, Shropshire (45 per cent) and Tunbridge Wells, Kent (34  per cent).

The higher rates come 
just days after Britain’s big five banks – HSBC, Santander, Barclays, 
Lloyds and RBS –finished revealing their financial results  for last 
year.

Overall, the five made profits of 
£10.7billion from their high-street banking operations, excluding the 
cost of compensation to their payment protection insurance victims.

John
 Mann, a senior Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, described 
any rate rises as an ‘outrage’ considering the money Halifax took when 
it was bailed out by the taxpayer.

He said: ‘They take taxpayer money in 
the form of a bail-out and then take their money again through their 
mortgages – it is totally unfair.’

RBS has announced its increase, to take effect on May 1, on RBS and NatWest-branded offset mortgages.

The same change will apply to its ‘One Account’ range, which includes Virgin One, DirectLine One and NatWest One.

It blamed the increase on the higher cost of wholesale borrowing, which it had now decided to ‘pass on’.

The ‘bad bank’ set up by the Government to manage the toxic loans of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley repaid £2.15billion to taxpayers last year.

But this progress came at a high price for homeowners, as 8,749 families had their properties repossessed – a 10 per cent increase on 2010.

Debt charities yesterday said that families were paying for the reckless lending of Northern Rock and B&B, which brought the banks to their knees.

Taxpayers were also warned that it could
 be up to 15 years before the rescue loans were repaid, with almost 
£47billion outstanding.

UK Asset Resolution, established by the Government to manage the bad loans issued by the stricken lenders, announced that profits had soared 145 per cent to £1.09billion last year.

This enabled it to repay £2.15billion to the Treasury, taking its total repayments to £3.1billion.

While the ‘bad’ part of Northern Rock has prospered, the ‘good’ part – which runs savings accounts – made a £79million loss in the first half of last year, and fell £232million into the red in 2010.

Yesterday UKAR revealed a surge in repossessions as families failed to keep up with mortgage repayments.

Cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Northern Rock’s Newcastle heartland were particularly hard-hit. 

Richard Banks, chief executive of UKAR, insisted it had done everything in its power to help struggling families.
