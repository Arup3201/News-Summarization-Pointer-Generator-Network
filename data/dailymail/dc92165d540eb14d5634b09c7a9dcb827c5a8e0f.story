With gruesome beheadings, mosques being blown up and bloodied corpses strewn across the dusty ground, it has all the hallmarks of the latest Islamic State recruitment video.

But this shocking footage has been compiled by the U.S. State Department in a propaganda drive of its own to discourage would-be jihadists from joining the terror group.

Its emergence comes as President Barack Obama prepares for a critical speech on Wednesday in which he intends to begin laying out his strategy for defeating the Muslim extremists.

The video, which has been viewed more 
than 500,000 times, was posted on YouTube with the title Welcome to the 
'Islamic State' land in a campaign called 'Think Again, Turn Away'.

Social media warfare: The U.S. State Department has posted a chilling video online showing executions (above) and suicide bombings in a drive to discourage would-be jihadists from joining the Islamic State

Gruesome: The video compiles shocking images used in the Islamic State's own propaganda footage in recent weeks, including this one of prisoners being killed and crucified

Hard-hitting: The video, which has been viewed more than 500,000 times, was posted on YouTube as part of a campaign called 'Think Again, Turn Away' to dissuade U.S. citizens who may be thinking about joining ISIS

It starts with the phrase: 'Run. Do not walk to ISIS land' before showing a body being thrown off a cliff.

Then, using macabre clips posted by IS in its own videos, it proceeds to show executions, crucifixions and suicide bombings - skills it says sympathizers can learn if they join the group.

Many of the images are far too graphic to show.

It ends with the sarcastic sign off: 'Travel is inexpensive because you won't need a return ticket!' followed by more images of blood-covered bodies slumped on the ground.

Shocking: The video also contains security footage of a suicide bomber (top left) blowing up a mosque

The campaign, directed at Muslims in the United States, aims to counter the Islamic State's powerful social media machine which has been used to recruit fighters from across the world

Mocking tone: The video lists so-called 'useful skills' like blowing up mosques which ISIS sympathisers can learn if they join the group

The campaign, directed at Muslims in the United States, aims to counter the Islamic State's powerful social media machine which has been used to recruit fighters from across the world with messages and videos on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

Alberto Fernandez, co-ordinator of the State Department's Center for Strategic Counter-terrorism Communications, which runs the program, has called it ‘participating in the marketplace of ideas', according to CNN.

The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group’s extremism.

'Our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda', the State Department said on the campaign's Facebook page.

As 
concerns grow over the allure of ISIS to some young men, it’s hoped that
 the video will steer them away from travelling overseas.

At present, more than 100 U.S. citizens have travelled overseas to join the jihadist group.

The video ends with the sarcastic sign off: 'Travel is inexpensive because you won't need a return ticket!'

In an escalation of the offensive against IS, President Obama is expected to lay his strategy when he meets with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House tomorrow.

He will then deliver a speech on Wednesday on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.

Lawmakers said in advance that they would like the president to give specifics.

The president should target command and control centers and oil refineries controlled by insurgents within Syria, suggested Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees.

Rubio, claiming that Obama has committed 'presidential malpractice in his foreign policy,' said he is eager to hear directly what Obama 'should have said months, weeks ago.'

'First, clearly explain to the American people what our national security interests are in the region' and spell out the risk that Islamic State militants pose 'for us, short-term and long-term, and why they matter,' Rubio told CBS' 'Face the Nation.'

'Clearly, he's put together a coalition of the willing - we have heard that before - to tackle this problem,' said House Intelligence Republican Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN. 'That's good.'

Sickening: The US State Department video is intended to shock would-be jihadists from wanting to join IS

The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group's extremism

Speaking Monday on MSNBC, Rogers said, 'I think in Congress we need to expose all members to the level of threat that those of us on the national security committees see every day.'

He said Washington political leaders should not give the Islamic militants the 'time and space' to grow into a more formidable force, which he said happened with the al-Qaida terrorist network.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on the same CNN program that Obama needs to spell out both the diplomatic and military components of his strategy.

'Time's a-wasting, because we have now said that we're going to go on the offensive. And it's time for America to project power and strength,' Feinstein said.

Obama sparked criticism, most of it from Republicans, for his remark last week that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for confronting Islamic extremists gaining both land and followers in the Middle East.

His upcoming sessions with lawmakers and the speech to the nation are clearly an attempt to try to show he now has an evolving strategy in place.

'The next phase is now to start going on some offense,' Obama said in an interview with NBC's 'Meet the Press.'

'But
 this is not going to be an announcement about U.S. ground troops,' he 
added in the session taped Saturday and broadcast Sunday.

The operations will be 'similar to the kinds of counterterrorism campaigns' the U.S. has waged in the past, Obama said. 'In Syria, the boots on the ground have to be Syrian.'

At the recent NATO summit in Wales, the U.S. and nine allies agreed to take on the militants because of the threat they pose to member countries.

In addition to laying claim to territory, the militants have targeted religious and ethnic minority groups and threatened U.S. personnel and interests in the region.

At Obama's direction, the U.S. military has conducted more than 130 airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq in the past month.

In retaliation, the group recently beheaded two American journalists it had been holding hostage in Syria, where the organisation also operates.

But the president has repeated his opposition to sending in U.S. ground troops to engage in direct combat with the militants, who have laid claim to large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.

Lawmakers have pressed Obama, so far unsuccessfully, to expand the airstrikes further.
