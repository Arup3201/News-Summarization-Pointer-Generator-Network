Number of terminally ill people choosing to die Assisted suicides deaths have soared by 43 per cent in a U.S. state in the last year alone, latest figures revealed yesterday.

The number of people who died in Washington state after they ingested lethal drugs climbed dramatically from 116 in 2012 to 159 last year.

The 2013 figure is also three times the number who committed assisted suicide in 2009, the first year of the operation of the Death With Dignity Act.

Assisted suicide was legalised in Washington state in 2008 and the Act came into force at the beginning of March the following year (pictured is Mount St Helens in Washington state)

Ninety-seven per cent of the people who died last year were classed as ‘white non-Hispanic’, about half were married and three quarters of them had at least a college education. More than 90 per cent of those who died had either cancer or a degenerative disease.

A total of 61 per cent said they wanted to die because they feared becoming a ‘burden on family, friends or caregivers’.

Others said they no longer wanted to live because they were afraid of ‘losing autonomy’ or ‘being less able to engage in activities making life enjoyable’. 

Just 36 per cent voiced concerns about the ability of doctors to control their pain. 

Assisted suicide was legalised in Washington in 2008 and the Act came into force at the beginning of March the following year.

It applied to people judged to have about six months or less to live and whose decision to end their lives had the support of two doctors.

In the first 10 months of 2009, a total of 64 people took their own lives, and in the following years the numbers increased each time, rising from 85 in 2010 to 101 in 2011.

Elspeth Chowdharay-Best, the honorary secretary of Alert, the UK anti-euthanasia group, described the latest surge was ‘absolutely horrifying’.

‘People are wilfully ignoring the evidence of what happens when assisted suicide is legalised,’ she said.

‘Time and again we incremental increases in the numbers of people dying and in some places we see the categories of people who qualify for death widening repeatedly.’

The Washington State Department of Health Death With Dignity Act report comes just weeks after figures from Belgium revealed that doctors there are killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia.

The statistics from Brussels also show a huge 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia cases in the last year alone in a country which in February became the first in the world to extend euthanasia to children.

In Britain, the former Labour Minister Lord Falconer has introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into Parliament to legalise assisted suicide.

It will have its Second Reading in the House of Lords on July 18 when peers will have the opportunity to vote on the proposed legislation for the first time.
