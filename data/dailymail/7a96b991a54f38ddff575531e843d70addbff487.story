An eagle belonging to a species facing extinction died when a branch fell onto its cage - inside a conservation group breeding centre.

'Arakan', 15, was one of just 250 adult Philippine eagles left alive, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The unlucky bird was crushed when days of torrential rain caused a huge branch to shear away from a tree and plummet onto Arakan's cage at the Philippine Eagle Foundationâ€™s centre in the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines on January 18.

Gulf News reported the trees are planted inside the centre because the conservation group attempts to simulate the birds' conditions in the wild.

The eagle, also called the 'Monkey-eating Eagle', is one of the largest birds of prey in the world and can have a two-metre wingspan.

The eagle is known to be geographically restricted to the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.

The majestic birds are monogamous and they bond for life and are admired for their elongated nape feathers.

The Philippine Eagle Foundation has been primarily responsible for producing fourteen captive-bred Philippine Eagles to date.

It also rehabilitates injured eagles recovered from the wild.

Efforts to release rehabilitated birds into the wild have suffered setbacks. In October last year, a young male eagle was found apparently shot to death just two months after it was freed.
