A primary school teacher has shed five stone after being tormented about looking like Muppets character Miss Piggy by students while at university.

Katie Milner, 22, tipped the scales at 15st 3lbs after years of eating on takeaway food, chocolate and up to five bags of crisps a day at university.

She had gained so much weight it took her 10 minutes to put her shoes on and caused her to suffer from ankle and chest pains. She also developed asthma.

Cruel: Katie Milner was called Miss Piggy before she lost weight

But 5ft 3ins tall Katie decided she needed to lose weight after being called fat and branded ‘Miss Piggy’ by fellow students at university.

Over the last three years, Katie has managed to shed five stone. Her weight has now settled at a more svelte 10st 3lbs and she has dropped from size 20 to a trim size 10.

Yesterday
Katie, from Meriden, West Midlands, said: 'I couldn’t believe what I 
looked like. I was huge and decided enough was enough.

‘I would be called a ‘fat pig’ by some people and 'Miss Piggy', which was hard to take.

‘When I saw a photograph of myself looking really big I knew I had to do something.

‘I’m
grinning in all of the photos of me when I was fat, but it was all a 
front. I wasn’t happy. I had no self confidence and I hated the way I 
looked.’

Katie, who started as a primary school teacher last September, used to hoard chocolate and crisps in her bedroom as a child.

She said: ‘My weight was always an issue from a young age and it had a big impact on my self-esteem.

‘I
used to try silly diets that were dangerous and, at the age of 17, I 
was put under the observation of a doctor and dietician as I was making 
myself sick.’

She said: ‘I’m so much fitter and healthier and no longer asthmatic.

‘I can do 10 mile runs, my ankles are back to a normal size and I no longer suffer stomach or chest pains.

‘I have also noticed a real difference in my love life.

‘I never really had many boyfriends because I had no self confidence but I am getting a lot more attention from men now which is great.

‘I was engaged a few months ago but we split up and now I’m a single girl and loving life.’
