Ahead of Saturday’s eagerly anticipated El Clasico match between Real Madrid and Barcelona, Facebook’s data team has created a global map that shows which team is preferred in nearly every country across the globe. 

These fierce rivals happen to be the most-liked sport teams on Facebook: FC Barcelona has more than 77 million likes while Real Madrid comes in close second with 75.5 million likes. 

Real Madrid’s own Cristiano Ronaldo is also a social media superstar having recently become the first athlete in the world to reach 100 million Facebook likes. 

This global map created by Facebook's date team shows the breakdown of Barca and Real fans in the world 

British Facebook fans are firmly in favour of Luis Enrique's side while Brazil’s football fans have unsurprisingly chosen national idol Neymar's club.
