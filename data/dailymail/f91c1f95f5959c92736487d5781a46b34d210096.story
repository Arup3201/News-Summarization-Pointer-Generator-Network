 

This shocking footage shows a woman being kneed in the face and pulled around a room by her hair by a shopping centre security guard after she protested at being detained in a holding room. 

Amazingly, the woman - who was banned from the mall in Sydney for shoplifting - was charged with assault after the video was viewed by police.

It is also used by the security company to 'entertain' staff as part of a gag reel video of CCTV mishaps, according to Seven News.

Merrill Bates (wearing blue) has been charged with assaulting a security officer, despite CCTV footage indicating she was the apparent victim in the violent attack

The female security stormed into the room and pinned Ms Bates back, appear to slam her against the wall

The woman was allegedly prevented from accessing the footage until after her court case, despite asking to see it.

Merrill Bates had entered the Westpoint Blacktown shopping centre in September and was put in the room after being recognised by security staff. 

She is seen kicking the door before it is quickly pushed open, hitting her in the face. The security guard then appears to lunge at her.

The female security stormed into the room, hitting Ms Bates with the door as it opened (left). She then slammed Ms Bates against the wall. At this point, Ms Bates swung at the security guard

After Ms Bates hit out at the security guard, the security guard is seen kneeing her in the face and pulling her to the ground by her hair

‘I was worried I was going to get hurt with how little I am,’ Ms Bates told Seven News.

‘I was worried she was going to break my bones with how big and hard the door is.’

Ms Bates is shown retaliating to the attack once, hitting out at the security guard.

For the remainder of the footage, she protects her head with her hands as she is pulled by her hair and flung against the wall, to the floor and against the metal bench.

Two other security guards are seen running in to separate them.

Ms Bates says she asked for the footage, but no one allowed her to see it until after the trial. She says the footage shows that she was retaliating to an attack that was initiated by the security guard

There has been no disciplinary action for the security guard, an employee of Millennium High Tech, according to Seven News

However, after this incident Ms Bates was detained and charged with assaulting the security guard.

As Ms Bates slapped the security guard once, she pleaded guilty to the assault, hoping for a lenient sentence but hsaid she may not have done so if she had seen the footage before the case got to court. 

There has been no disciplinary action for the security guard, an employee of Millennium High Tech, according to Seven News.
