Looking more like a stealth aircraft because of its black paint job, Boeing's highly anticipated first Dreamliner 787-9 has been handed over to Air New Zealand at a glitzy ceremony in the United States.

New Zealand's national carrier became the first airline to receive the Rolls-Royce powered, fuel-efficient passenger plane when it was unveiled in front of hundreds of aviation enthusiasts at the Future of Flight museum near Seattle on Thursday.

In line with the country's all-conquering All Blacks rugby union side, the aircraft was decked out in the dark hue with the iconic silver fern breaking up the uniformity on its tail.

The new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner delivered to Air New Zealand was the first of its kind

Boeing delivered its first 787-9 to Air New Zealand in front of a crowd of thousands of media and guests

It was painted in New Zealand's signature colour of black with the iconic silver fern on its tail

It took 12 painters five days and about 350 litres of paint to complete the sleek look.

Inside the 63m-long plane, the theme continues with its passenger seats covered in black upholstery contrasted with a violet colour for the backs of the chairs and television screens installed in the head rests.

When full, the Dreamliner's two economy cabins will fly a total of 263 passengers along with 18 business class ticket holders and 21 in premium economy, with a range of 15,372km.

The difference between the 787-9 and its sister Dreamliner model is mostly cosmetic. Its body is more than 6m longer than the 787-8 and will fly up to 40 more passengers an additional 830km using 20 per cent less fuel and 20 per cent lower emissions than similar-sized airplanes.

Like the earlier model, it will also continue to offer passengers features such as large windows, roomy stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride.

The plane is 63m-long with a wingspan of 60m, with a cruise speed of more than 900km and range of 15,000km

The new aircraft boasts a capacity of 302 passengers, with 18 business class and 21 premium economy seats

So far, Boeing has received 409 orders for the 787-9 from 26 airlines worldwide, which is almost 40 percent of all 787 orders.

The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner will makes its maiden flight in October, flying from Auckland to Perth - one of three international routes including Auckland to Tokyo and Auckland to Shanghai.

Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon said the delivery of the 787-9 was the start of an exciting new era for the airline.

'It's a privilege to be the global launch customer for this aircraft and our team is looking forward to flying it home to New Zealand,' he said.

'The 787-9 is a real game changer and we canâ€™t wait for our customers to experience it.'

Boeing's John Wojick said the delivery was a tribute to the hard work and dedication of the organisation's employees.

'Air New Zealand was a perfect partner for us in developing the 787-9, given its innovative spirit, unique mission requirements and geography,' the senior vice president of Global Sales and Marketing said.

'The 787-9, combined with Air New Zealand's exceptional onboard service, will set them apart from the competition by providing an unrivaled flying experience.'

The plane is confirmed to fly three different international flights from Auckland to Perth, Tokyo and Shanghai

Air New Zealand currently has 10 of these planes on order with Boeing, and replace the current 767 fleet
