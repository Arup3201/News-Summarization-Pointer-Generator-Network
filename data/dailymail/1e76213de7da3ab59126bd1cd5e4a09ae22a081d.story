Top earner: Jo-Anne Wass will earn £155,000 a year for two years after quitting next month, it has emerged

One of the most powerful women in the NHS is to be paid £300,000 over two years  after leaving her job.

Jo-Anne Wass, a senior director at NHS England, will earn up to £155,000 for each of the next two years – even though she is quitting next month.

The 46-year-old is a close ally of NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, the ‘man with no shame’, who has been forced to retire early over his links to the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

It is understood that Miss Wass arranged to leave before his replacement arrives next month, to take up an unpaid consultancy role at Leeds University.

NHS England insisted they would carry on paying her salary for up to two years as she is ‘on secondment’, even though she will not return.

Details of the extraordinary agreement, uncovered by Health Service Journal, have emerged as thousands of nurses and midwives will find out today that their pay will be cut in real terms.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is understood to have ignored the advice of independent experts to grant NHS staff a pay rise of 1 per cent.

Instead, the increase will be between 0 and 1 per cent, but as the rate of inflation is just below 2 per cent it is effectively a pay cut.

Charlotte Leslie, a Tory MP and member of the Health Select Committee, described the pay-off as ‘absolutely unbelievable’.

‘It shows that the NHS is a tale of two worlds,’ she said.

‘There is the hard-working front line who abide by economic rules and austerity.

'And then you have this kind of luxury bubble of NHS management which is completely unaccountable, still splashing out money like it grows on trees. It’s vital we burst this bubble.

‘This news is a punch in the face for people working on the front line and taking a hit, seeing people poncing around in quango bodies seemingly getting enormous pay-offs.’

Tory MP Andrew Percy said Miss Wass ‘should do the decent thing and reject this salary’.

The news comes after Jeremy Hunt refused to raise NHS staff pay by 1 per cent despite expert advice

Miss Wass was last year named as one of the ten highest earners in the health service, on a salary of between £155,000 and £160,000.

She lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with her husband John and has worked for the NHS for 24 years, currently as the national director of human resources and organisational development.

A spokesman for NHS England said they had agreed with Miss Wass to continue paying her, adding: ‘There are real benefits to encouraging the links between local education and the health care sector.

‘Jo-Anne thinks it is right that NHS England has certainty in planning for the future. As a result, Jo-Anne has made it clear that she has no intention of returning to her role.’
