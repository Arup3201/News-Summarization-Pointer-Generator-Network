It was an occasion for joyous remembrance, not sadness, yesterday as members of the Royal Family recalled the remarkable lives of the late Queen Mother and her daughter, Princess Margaret.

A service at Windsor Castle, organised by the Queen, saw glowing tributes paid to the royal women, who died within weeks of each other ten years ago.

The event turned into even more of a celebration as the royal family gathered, when Princess Anne announced that her son, Peter Phillips, and his wife, Autumn, had just been safely delivered of a baby girl.

Royal
family: Princess Beatrice, Timothy Laurence, Sophie, Countess of 
Wessex, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, 
Princess Eugenie, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and 
Princess Anne attended the ceremony for the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret this morning

Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall looked elegant in 
blue and cream coat with a matching broad-brimmed hat, while Princess 
Beatrice chose a silk floral pencil skirt and cropped blue jacket with a discreet cream fascinator

The Queen wore a pale lavender suit with 
flower-trimmed hat, while Princess Eugenie wore a red printed dress and navy coat and hat

Isla Elizabeth Phillips – the Queen’s 
second great-grandchild - arrived at Gloucestershire Hospital late on 
Thursday night weighing a healthy 7lb 4oz. New man Peter, who recently 
quit his job at Royal Bank of Scotland, was present at the birth.

The couple chose the name Isla in 
honour of the family’s links to Scotland and ‘because they liked it’, 
while Elizabeth was, clearly a tribute to Peter’s grandmother.

Isla is now 13th in line to the throne
as her mother renounced her Catholic faith shortly before she married 
and Buckingham Palace said yesterday that everyone was ‘delighted’ by 
her arrival.

Almost every senior member of the 
Royal Family turned up for yesterday’s service, the most notable 
exception being the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who were, remarkably, 
given permission to go skiing.

Potential Olympics horsewoman Zara 
Phillips is understood to have been training while Prince Edward was 
absent as he is on an official visit to France.

In advance of the Queen and her 
husband, Prince Philip, who arrived by car just in time for the 11am 
service, the rest of the family made their way down to St George’s 
Chapel from the castle on foot, laughing and smiling in the unseasonably
warm sunshine.

Princess Beatrice, eldest daughter of 
the Duke of York, was the most stylish among them in a form-fitting 
floral dress, cropped navy jacket and jaunty fascinator with LK Bennett 
shoes.

Beatrice, who has lost almost two 
stones in weight, has been keeping her figure trim with regular personal
training sessions and is tomorrow due to start and take part in the 
National Lottery Olympic Park Run, which will see 5,000 members of the 
public become the first people to cross the Olympic finish line.

She was accompanied by her sister, 
Princess Eugenie, who has also noticeably lost weight of late and looked
equally smart in a patterned mini dress and navy coat.

The Countess of Wessex wore one of her trademark striking hats, set at an acute angle and featuring a froth of black feathers.

The eye-catching headgear certainly 
caught the eye of her nephew, Prince Harry, who appeared unsure which 
cheek to kiss her on, prompting the pair to burst into giggles.

Also among the group were the Prince 
of Wales – who was exceptionally close to his grandmother - his wife, 
the Duchess of Cornwall, wearing a blue and white Bruce Oldfield dress 
and coat with a Philip Treacy hat, and Princess Anne and her husband, 
Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence.

A smiling Harry was followed into the chapel by his cousin, Princess Eugenie, who wore a printed Marc Jacobs dress and navy coat by Austique and hat by Marzi

praised at a memorial service today for 'enriching' the lives of their 
family and friends

Inside the chapel, where the remains 
of the Queen Mother and Margaret are both interred, the Dean of Windsor,
the Right Reverend David Conner, said that both women had 
‘significantly enriched’ the lives of those present.

‘Each of us here this morning will 
cherish some special personal memories; memories that awaken once again 
sentiments of affection and respect,’ he said.

Among the congregation at the private 
service were playwright Sir Tom Stoppard and actress Felicity Kendal, 
friends of Margaret who both attended her memorial service in 2002.

Also present was the Queen Mother's 
official biographer William Shawcross and horse trainer Nicky Henderson,
a friend of the Queen and her mother.

Margaret’s son, Viscount Linley, who 
was accompanied by his wife, Serena, and sister, Lady Sarah Chatto, and 
their children, gave a reading, a religious piece by the former Dean of 
Westminster, Eric Abbott - titled The Compassion of God and the Passion 
of Christ - part of which was read at his mother's funeral.

Hymns sung included O God, Our Help In Ages Past, Angel Voices Ever Singing, and Now Thank We All Our God.

The Queen Mother died peacefully in 
her sleep 10 years ago to the day - March 30 2002 - aged 101, while her 
daughter died the previous month aged 71, after suffering the third in a
series of strokes.

The period was a momentous one for the
Queen who was celebrating 50 years on the throne as well as mourning 
the passing of her beloved mother and younger sister.

At the end of yesterday’s service the 
Queen, Philip and senior members of the royal family were privately 
taken to the King George VI memorial chapel where the remains of the 
King, his wife and their daughter are interred.

Beatrice attracted endless attention for her unusual fascinator at the royal wedding last year - not all of it good - and has since opted for much more subtle headgear
