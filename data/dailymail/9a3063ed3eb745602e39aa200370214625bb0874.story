Azrum Begum, 54, from Bradford, West Yorks, was admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary for routine gall bladder surgery, but later died from multiple organ failure after a series of errors in the operation

A mother who died due to a series of errors following a routine operation was told by nurses to 'stop being a baby and grow up', an inquest heard.

Azrum Begum, 54, from Bradford, West Yorks, died in 'astronomical pain' after a routine operation turned into a disaster when surgeons left holes in her stomach, the hearing heard.

Her grieving family said she was told by nurses to 'stop being a baby and grow up' before dying in hospital of multi-organ failure two days after gall bladder surgery.

They added that staff, annoyed by Mrs Begum's cries of pain, refused to give her more medication and switched off her bedside bell to reach medical staff.

The mother of three had two holes in her stomach muscle caused by a pen-like instrument used in surgery at Bradford Royal Infirmary.

Ms Begum's son Mohammed Faraz told the inquest: 'She was in astronomical pain.

'Because of her rheumatoid arthritis she has a high pain threshold but she was behaving like a child.'

It was not until the morning after the operation that nurses alerted staff and an urgent CT scan was ordered, the hearing heard.

Communication breakdowns meant Mrs Begum's surgical team were not informed the mother was being kept in hospital because of pain, meaning she did not get a post-operative review after surgery.

Meanwhile, Mrs Begum's urgent scan was delayed by hours after a porter couldn't find her after she was moved to another ward.

Coroner Dominic Bell said there had been a catalogue of deficiencies in care given to Mrs Begum in her last hours.

Surgeons repaired the holes in her stomach, which the coroner concluded were most likely caused by surgical instruments in her previous operation.

Bradford Teaching Hospital Trust's interim director Dr Robin Jeffrey expressed deep regrets for the way Mrs Begum was treated at Bradford Royal Infirmary.

He said: 'I'd like to express our sincere regrets to the family for how this has turned out.'

Bradford Teaching Hospital Trust's director Dr Robin Jeffrey said the Trust had learnt a number of lessons and made changes since Mrs Begum's death - such as better checks on patients recovering from surgery

Dr Jeffrey said the Trust had learnt a number of lessons and made changes since Mrs Begum's death in November 2012 from multi-organ failure.

Changes included supervising trainees, more observations and better checks on patients recovering from surgery.

Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Bell said there had been a number of deficiencies in care but added he was satisfied with investigations since carried out by the NHS Trust.

He said: 'I'm also satisfied that the deficiencies in care were identified and that they have been appropriately addressed with remedial action.

'I see no requirement on my part to take any further action.'

Following the inquest, Mr Faraz said: 'We feel we have got more information about lessons learned and changes made than the Trust made us privy to before.

'We are happy about that and that the Trust has said it will meet us again.'

Speaking today, Mrs Begum's eldest son, Mohammed Ayaz, said: 'It was like the Nurses were calling my mum a wimp.

'One nurse even said to her, 'Come on now, I've had this operation and it wasn't so bad'.

'My mum had a high pain threshold because she has suffered with arthritis for the past 30 years, she has had operations in the past.

'She said to me that she has had operations before and has not known pain like this, but the nurses assured me it was normal and so I said to my mum that it was normal.

'But I was wrong, and the medical professionals were wrong.

'My mum was going in for a routine operation and she ends up coming out dead.

'Mum just wanted the operation over with, she was looking forward to going on holiday visiting her mum in Pakistan, she should not have died.'
