A father has found a creative way to spend time with his baby while his wife was away.

He shared a 53-second video on YouTube, giving insight into how he likes to entertain himself and the baby - inspired by the well-known mask from graphic novel-turned-thriller movie V for Vendetta.

Although it is unclear what country the man or baby are from, user 'Perfect Daddy' identifies himself as Bartosz in his YouTube profile and says he is the father of three-month-old Emily.

The video, titled 'What happens when my wife leaves me alone with a baby', shows a man filming his baby as he sticks thick black eyebrows and a goatee on her.

The little one happily complies, even sharing a few giggles with her dad as he laughs at his makeover attempt.

It replicates the mask worn by popularised character Guy Fawkes from V for Vendetta but is also the infamous symbol of online hacktivist group Anonymous. 

Posting the clip under the username 'Perfect Daddy', he leaves a description of the video: 'My wife left me with a baby.' 

He introduces himself in his profile as Bartosz and a father to Emily. 

'I'm happy to see that you like my cute baby,' he wrote.

'I was thinking about adding some funny movies with her in the future, so if you want, just subscribe my channel.'
