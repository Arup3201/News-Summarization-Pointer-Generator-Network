In a story that mirrors the 1961 Hayley Mills film The Parent Trap (and the 1998 Lindsey Lohan remake), a couple are remarrying more than 30 years since their divorce after their daughter reunited them.

Bev Worsnop was just 16 when she married her childhood sweetheart Robert Worthington in 1975 in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

They split up five years later but finally found love again after their daughter Kelly Worthington, 32, got back in touch with her dad a couple of years ago.

It must be love: Robert Worthington and Bev Worsnop are today remarrying, having first married in 1975 but getting divorced five years later

They'll get married for the second time at Bolton Register Office, Greater Manchester, today.

Bev said: 'We first met when I had a party in my house while my parents were away. I'd been to the Stag's Head pub in St Helens Road beforehand and met Robert.

'I told him I was holding a party and he said he was going to one too. It turned out it was the same party. We were married at the old Bolton Register Office in the town centre and stayed together for five years.

'I was only 16 and was pregnant, but we both felt we had been too young to get married. We wanted some freedom.'

However, when their daughter, Kelly from Tonge Moor, wanted to get back in touch with her father, the couple, who live near to each other in Aldersyde Street, Great Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester, were reunited.

Ms Worsnop said: 'We had a 30-year gap during which I remarried and then separated again. But Kelly got me and Robert back together.

'She'd grown up living with me, but wanted to make contact with Robert. So I left a note at his home just under two years ago, saying Kelly wanted to get in touch with him.

'Kelly is now over the moon that we are getting married again. There's a lot of catching up for us all to do.'

Reunited: Ms Worsnop is keeping her wedding dress a secret from her 59-year-old husband-to-be, but their daughter Kelly will be a witness and granddaughter Lauren Richards Worthington, aged 17, is a bridesmaid

Ms Worsnop asked her father, Arthur Ellis, aged 82, of Great Lever, about her marrying again. She said: 'He is giving me away at the wedding.'
