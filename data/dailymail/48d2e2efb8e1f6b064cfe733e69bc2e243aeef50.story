Police had to break up motorists massing at Illinois gas station on Sunday night - after a glitch meant the Shell station was charging just one cent for a gallon of fuel.

The national average for a gallon of gas is $3.294 but some lucky drivers in Woodstock, Il, filled up for just $0.011. Word quickly got round and police officers arrived to investigate the congestion.

Sergeant Dennis Leard told the Northwest Herald they cleared the line of cars but it immediately reformed. Police then noticed the very cheap gas and realized what was happening.

Bargain: Gas was available for a short time at 1 penny a gallon thanks to a glitch at a Shell station in Illinois

Fill up! One lucky driver got 10 gallons of gas for just 12 cents

'The clerk didn't appear to be aware (of the price change),' Leard told the Herald. 'We made him aware of the situation and instructed him to shut off his pumps and fix the problem.'

Sergeant Leard said the bargain fuel was available for around two hours at 315 N. Madison St in the town 51 miles north west of Chicago, before police stopped it after 9.30 on Sunday night.

Shell worker Drita Castillo told CBS that she had no idea how many people benefited from the error but said she felt sorry for her boss and was upset that no one alerted staff to the obvious mistake.

But local radio station Star 105.5 posted photos of the amazing price on their Facebook page.

Sight for sore eyes: The national average for a gallon of gas is $3.294 but some lucky drivers on Sunday filled up for just $0.011

Lucky: No one knows how many drivers got gas at the insane price of $0.011 per gallon

'GAS FOR ONE CENT IN WOODSTOCK! No joke. Here's one listener's receipt and we're sure it's been changed since then. Not bad for 10 gallons...12 cents! What's this 1920?' the station wrote.

Another photo on the page shows a long line of cars waiting for the gas and the stunning display on the pumps. Castillo told the Herald that she had never seen anything like this before.

Though she wasn't working on Sunday night, she was told about the incident on Monday and she immediately checked that prices were back to normal.

'The first thing I did was run outside this morning to make sure the pumps were OK,' she said. 'It's not good for business.'
