Her grandfather is Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone.

So perhaps it’s not surprising that four-week-old Sophia already has her own impressive sets of wheels.

Tamara Ecclestone’s baby daughter has been seen being taken around London by her mother and father Jay Rutland in up to five different prams in recent days.

The Silver Cross: Costs £1,450 before being customised with crystals and silver nameplate

She was first seen in a pink Silver Cross pram customised with Swarovski crystals and a silver nameplate which reads ‘Sophia’. The Balmoral pram, a gift from Miss Ecclestone’s sister Petra, costs £1,450 – before being customised.

The second pram was a Bugaboo Buffalo worth £879 which Miss Ecclestone, 29, chose for a walk through a London park.

Last Wednesday mother and daughter were seen with a cream-coloured Stokke Cruisi Complete. A gift from Mr Rutland’s family, it has built-in ventilation, carry handles and a shopping basket, and costs £1,148.

Two days later, Sophia was out in a £999 Bugaboo Donkey with Andy Warhol canopy featuring a colourful butterfly design based on a 1954 artwork called Happy Bug Day by the late American artist.

The fifth pram was also a Bugaboo Cameleon 3, this time with a cream canopy. The pram costs £819 in its standard version.

At her mother’s £45million home in London, Sophia also has her own baby-sized spa bath – a MagicBath from Italian design firm BluBleu which cost £1,400. It pumps air into the water through ten jets and even has multi-coloured underwater lights.

She has also been given Tiffany ironstone ceramic crockery, with cute blue and yellow duck motifs which belie the £110 price tag.

And for when nature calls, Mummy has a bespoke Hermes nappy bag – costing an astonishing £20,000.
