A 20-year-old man threatened patients and nurses with a gun at a Florida hospital Sunday morning before shooting himself in the head.

Jonathan Rodriguez-Jeff of Deltona shot a glass door entrance at Halifax Hospital's Professional Building before going to the second floor where he confronted a nurse and a patient inside a room.

‘Do you want to die tonight?’ the suspect reportedly asked them.

Rodriguez-Jeff left the room and went into a second room, confronting another nurse and patient, according to NBC6. Shortly thereafter, he committed suicide inside the room by shooting himself in the head, police said.

 ordeal, investigators said. No patients were hurt.

responded to a report of shots being fired at a moving car Sunday at
