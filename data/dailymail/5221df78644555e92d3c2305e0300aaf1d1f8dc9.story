Passengers onboard a Southwest Airlines flight were forced to use its evacuation slides after the captain detected an odour in the cabin and made an emergency landing on Tuesday.

Smoke was reportedly detected less than half an hour after take-off, forcing the captain to declare an emergency and abort the flight from Austin, Texas, to Dallas.

When the Boeing 737 landed safely after returning to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, it stopped on the tarmac because of the fire threat and its inflatable slides deployed.

Flight 481, carrying 107 passengers and five crew members, did not taxi to the terminal because ground crews detected a hot spot on one of its wings.

Workers discovered the hot spot with a thermal imaging camera. 

Passenger Edward Lette told FOX 7 that his first experience of using the evacuation slide was unnerving but exciting.

He said: ‘It kind of ruined my day, but it was fun.’ 

FOX 7 reported that smoke was detected within the plane.

Passengers were put on different flights to make the 50-minute journey to Dallas.

The plane has been grounded while it undergoes an inspection and maintenance.
