A county court judge who approved his own pistol permit has been reprimanded on Judicial Conduct - after accidentally firing the weapon in his courthouse chambers.

Judge Vincent Sgueglia, the sole licensing officer in Tioga County, New York, was trying to repair his .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver during a break in court proceedings when he accidentally fired it at a wall.

The 70-year-old judge discharged the weapon in his own chambers after approving his own pistol permit.

The bullet from the firearm lodged in a wall, but noone was injured after the incident in 2010.

Sgueglia has since been censured by the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct.

According to reports, Judge Sgueglia had begun carrying a pistol after receiving threats from members of the public.

The judge reportedly feared for his own safety after receiving death threats from jail inmates and being followed while driving home from the courthouse.

The commission found that Sgueglia should not have used his decision-making authority for his own benefit, noting the permit has no restrictions and covers 20 pistols.

No one was hurt by the bullet fired from the revolver, but court officials were in a room nearby, it was reported.

Tioga County Sheriffâ€™s investigators determined the incident was an accident.

Sgueglia first took office in 1993 and his term in office was due to end at the end of this year.

He will not serve as a judicial hearing officer after leaving the bench and must not defer to another judge.

Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian said: 'To his credit, Judge Sgueglia readily acknowledged this principle and agreed that he should be censured for violating it and for his carelessness in repairing and firing a weapon in the courthouse.

'We are lucky and grateful that no one was injured.'
