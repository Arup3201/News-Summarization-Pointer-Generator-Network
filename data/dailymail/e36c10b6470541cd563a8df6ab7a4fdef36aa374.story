The treasurer of the scandal-hit police union admitted yesterday that even he didn’t know how much money it had stashed away in its secret accounts.

Just hours after the leaders of the embattled Police Federation quit, the shambolic state of the organisation’s finances were laid bare as treasurer Martyn Mordecai told MPs that he had spent years trying to find out how many millions were in the coffers, but rules prevented him from seeing the full figures.

Mr Mordecai, who has been in the federation for almost two decades and held the £61,000 a year post of treasurer since 2009 despite having no financial qualifications, claimed that he faced ‘abuse’ by branch colleagues just for asking how much money they have in secret ‘off-shore’ reserves.

A number of local branches are still refusing to publish their so-called ‘number two’ accounts, despite warnings from ministers that the union must open its books or face tough new laws forcing it to reform.

It also emerged yesterday that the police federation spent 50 per cent more than previously thought on a controversial PR firm who advised using ‘guerrilla tactics’ against ministers just weeks before the Plebgate scandal.

The body, which represents 127,000 rank and file officers, lavished £15,000-a-month on a media strategy calling for a military-style ‘blitzkrieg’ to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers.

A West Midlands branch of the organisation, which was at the centre of the ‘Plebgate’ storm, also paid out an extra £60,000 to the same public relations firm for anti-government posters, adverts on buses and bus shelters in Westminster and around the West Midlands during party conferences.

The deal was agreed just weeks before the Plebgate incident in September 2012, involving then chief whip Andrew Mitchell who allegedly called policeman at the gates of Downing Street ‘***ing plebs’.

Yesterday Mr Mordecai disclosed for the first time to a parliamentary committee that the federation has more than £21million in the bank and total assets of more than £107million.

A further £4.5million is buried in ‘number two’ accounts, but three branches in North Yorkshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire have refused to declare even to their national leaders how much money they have to the astonishment of MPs who said the organisation faced a ‘last chance saloon’.

When chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Keith Vaz asked why Mr Mordecai didn’t know about the reserves, he told him that the rules don’t currently allow the treasurer to see the figures, saying: ‘I have been trying to find out for a while, probably when I started off in 2009.’

He went on: ‘The funding system is archaic, it’s fundamentally wrong, that’s one of the reasons I want to stay.’ Mr Mordecai insisted that there was ‘nothing illegal’ in the secret accounts, exposing him to ridicule from MPs who pointed out that he doesn’t know how much is in the accounts and what they are used for.

He told the committee that his health had suffered after being subjected to ‘abuse’ from colleagues who did not want to disclose the number two account details.

Amid allegations of rampant spending on wining and dining on federation credit cards, Mr Mordecai confirmed that 30 board members had credit cards.

Under questioning from MP Michael Ellis, he also revealed that two senior figures flew out to Italy to source ‘toilet pods’ for the Federation’s £26million luxury HQ in Leatherhead, Surrey.

The revelations came just a day after two leading officials dramatically quit on Monday.

Chairman Steve Williams and general secretary Ian Rennie resigned following a series of investigations by the Daily Mail.

In January an independent review of the union by former Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington called for top-to-bottom reform and an end to a bullying culture.

Yesterday he warned the organisation faced a ‘very dangerous moment’.

He said the resignation of Mr Williams and Mr Rennie could pave the way for members who want to block much-needed reform to be elected as the new leadership.

He said: ‘I do think they need to think hard about this because the danger is - this is a very dangerous moment for the Federation.

It could be that the resignation of these two people will allow the people who want to block reform, it will allow them to be elected.’

Yesterday outgoing chairman Steve Williams said: ‘The Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) is currently in a necessary period of change.

‘Our purpose as a federation is to act as the representative body for our 127,000 members, the rank and file officers who bravely put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect the public.

There is a huge amount of excellent work being done across the organisation to support these goals.’

‘We will endeavour to engage and engender debate around the recommendations of the review as the decisions we make will provide a blueprint for considered, lasting change and guide the Federation into the future.’
