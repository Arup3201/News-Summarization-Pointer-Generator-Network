A 'lorry load' of evidence relating to an investigation into alleged police corruption over the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was systematically shredded over two days, it was reported today

THE mass shredding of files from a major Scotland Yard corruption inquiry was yesterday branded ‘an out and out disgrace’ by a murder victim’s brother.

Alastair Morgan, whose private eye brother Daniel was killed by an axeman in a plot allegedly involving police officers, hit out following reports that a ‘lorry load’ of documents from a top-secret corruption probe had been destroyed over two days.

The latest revelations deepened the Metropolitan Police ‘shredding scandal’ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force.

The large-scale destruction of corruption files was a key finding of a review of the Stephen Lawrence case, published earlier this month, which suggested possible links between an allegedly corrupt officer involved in the Lawrence case – former Detective Sergeant John Davidson – and the investigation into the Morgan murder.

Married father-of-two Daniel Morgan, 37, was found with an axe in his head in a south-east London pub car park in 1987.

His murder remains unsolved, despite five investigations. An independent judge-led panel of experts is now reviewing the police handling of the murder, amid claims corrupt officers prevented convictions.

Mr Morgan’s family say he was on the verge of exposing police corruption when he was killed. His brother Alastair added: ‘We need a supervised outside investigation into the shredding of the Met’s corruption files.

'This is not a mistake.’

Inquiry: The Bishop of Stepney, Sir William MacPherson, Tom Cook and Dr. Richard Stone - at the preliminary hearing of the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry in 1997

Following publication earlier this 
month of the review by Mark Ellison QC, it is now feared corrupt 
officers who thwarted justice in the Morgan case could also have 
shielded those who murdered Stephen in a racist attack in Eltham, 
south-east London, in 1993.

Buried
 in the review is a reference to a police intelligence report, dated 
April 28, 2004, concerning Operation Abelard, the investigation into 
Daniel Morgan’s murder.

The report had ‘specific emphasis’ on Davidson, and stated that he was attached to the initial Morgan investigation in 1987.

It
 said: ‘DS Davidson has been investigated by this command 
(Anti-Corruption Command) in the past and is known to associate with 
some of the subjects of not only Operation Abelard but also several 
other Directorate of Professional Standards investigations.’

Mr
 Ellison’s report found evidence to suspect that Davidson had acted 
corruptly in the Lawrence case, and that material had been withheld from
 the subsequent 1998 Macpherson Inquiry into the police’s handling of 
the black teenager’s murder.

The
 material that was shredded in 2003 was from a wider, top-secret 
investigation into possible police corruption that began in 1993 and 
came to be known as Operation Othona.

The
 Ellison report said it needed to see the Othona files to investigate 
possible links with the Lawrence case, and to establish what was known 
about police corruption at the time of the Macpherson Inquiry.

The latest revelations deepened the Scotland Yard's ¿shredding scandal¿ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force

It
 is alleged that when Stephen was murdered, Davidson was having a 
corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris, the gangster father of one of
 his killers, David Norris. The ex-detective denies this.

Some
 computer files relating to the Othona operation were found on a hard 
drive in a cardboard box in the Met Police’s professional standards 
department in November 2013.

But
 paper copies of the intelligence were missing. The Ellison review was 
told there had been a ‘mass shredding’ of them in 2003.

One source told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been a ‘lorry load’ of documents, photographs and videos.

In
 a message on Twitter yesterday, Alastair Morgan made clear he does not 
accept an innocent explanation for the mass shredding.

He
 told senior officers: ‘Don’t take the public for fools gentlemen. The 
shredding of the Othona files is an out and out disgrace.’

Yesterday
 Davidson, 65, said: ‘I am not corrupt. I would like to speak but I 
can’t basically. I am paying a lot of money to my solicitor and he’s 
told me to talk to nobody. That includes the Press.’

Scotland
 Yard said: ‘The Met was informed by a former employee on February 4, 
2014 that in 2003, two staff were tasked to shred a quantity of 
documents that related to corruption inquiries.

The information supplied by the witness was scant but the Met felt it necessary to pass it on to Mr Ellison’s review.

‘Met
 officers now intend to meet the witness to clarify their account. At 
this time the Met has little detail on the circumstances that led to the
 shredding.’
