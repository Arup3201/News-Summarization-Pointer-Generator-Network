A species of mussel which could devastate Britain’s wetlands and add millions of pounds to water bills has been discovered in a reservoir near London Heathrow Airport.

Quagga mussels – identified as the greatest single threat to Britain’s wildlife by an alien species by scientists – were found in the Wraysbury Reservoir, Staines, last week. 

The tiny molluscs, originally from the Ukraine, measure 2in long but breed so prolifically their vast colonies can block pipes and cause flooding.

They also eat pollutants and turn them into concentrated toxic faeces which can poison water.

The Wildfowl and Wetland Trust’s Jeff Knott said: ‘This could be devastating to British wetlands and cost millions to protect drinking water supplies.’
