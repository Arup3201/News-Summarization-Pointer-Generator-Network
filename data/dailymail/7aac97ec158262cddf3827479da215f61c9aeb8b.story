Burglars may have used Google Street View to raid a millionaire bank boss’s secluded mansion and steal £100,000 worth of jewellery.

Thieves broke into the home of Robin Bowie, founder of investment bank Dexion Capital, after apparently gaining intimate knowledge of the layout of his sprawling property.

They stole a hidden safe which they carted away in a wheelbarrow before making off in a silver-coloured saloon-style car just as Mr Bowie’s wife Sally, 51, arrived home at 7.30pm on January 10.

The safe held a haul of expensive jewellery and several thousand pounds in cash.

The thieves struck at the palatial mansion of Mr Bowie in East Langton, Leicestershire, where he lives with his wife Sally, 51, and their three children Georgina, Isabella and Johnny.

The intruders used a ladder to scale the 6ft-high perimeter wall at the front of the property before forcing open an upstairs window.

The gang then used a steel rod which they found on the family’s tennis court at the rear of the house to leaver out the safe which was bolted into a hidden cupboard.

A wheelbarrow in the garden was then used to transport the heavy safe to a waiting getaway car. The gang were almost caught when Mrs Bowie returned home seconds before the gang sped away.

He said: 'There was a combination of jewellery stolen. Things that were from my father and from my wife’s grandparents and parents, as well as things I had bought.

'My wife only saw one man but we think there would have had to have been more.

'I think they knew what they were looking for.

'We have lived in the house for 19 years and this is the first time we have been broken into.

'We do not have CCTV on the house. It is perfectly possible that whoever was responsible looked the property up on the internet.

'We live in an age where images and information is readily available on the internet and on the whole that is perfectly healthy and a good thing.

'However, Google is obviously a useful tool to those people planning burglaries.'

After dumping the wheelbarrow, the three raiders escaped in a pale, silver-coloured saloon-style car with the registration plate beginning with the letter R.

Yesterday Mr Bowie released pictures 
of the jewellery which was stolen in the hope that dealers who were 
offered it would report it to the police.

He added: 'It just makes you so much more apprehensive and less open to people. You become more suspicious about things.'

The jewellery includes watches, a necklace, bracelets and earrings.

Valuable: These are just two of the items of jewellery kept in the safe stolen by the thieves

Heirlooms: While some pieces had been bought by Mr Bowie, others were left to him and his wife by family

Investigating officer Detective Constable Melanie Fisher, of Leicestershire Police, said: 'The victims have been left upset at the loss of their family jewellery and are keen to do everything possible to ensure the return of their property.

'We would urge jewellers and pawn brokers to have a look at the images and contact us if they have been approached by someone selling similar items or even visited by someone asking for them to value the items.

'We are also keen to speak to anybody who saw someone acting suspiciously in the area at the time or who knows who may be responsible for the burglary.'
