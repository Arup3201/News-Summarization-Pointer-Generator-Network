A DJ who killed a friend with a single punch after a row about a cartoon penis was cleared of manslaughter today.

Victim Anthony Thompson, 26, had woken up after a house party to find a crude lipstick drawing had been scrawled on his face while he slept as a joke.

Fists flew when a furious Mr Thompson challenged fellow party-goer and DJ Thomas Evans, 32, to a fight - after mistakenly assuming he had drawn the genitalia, the court heard.

Cleared: Thomas Evans, 32, claimed he had acted in self-defence when Anthony Thompson, 26, challenged him to a fight outside a block of flats in south London.

The pair squared up outside a block 
of flats in south London and Evans punched Mr Thompson after he was hit 
with a glancing blow.

Mr Evans claimed he had acted in self-defence when he delivered a knock-out blow to Mr Thompson, adding that the victim swung the first punch at him, the court heard.

Mr Thompson fell to the floor, hitting his head and sustaining fatal brain damage.

Evans was cleared of manslaughter by an Old Bailey jury after nearly 15 hours’ deliberation spanning three days.

He doubled over in the dock as the 
verdict was announced before clasping his hands and beaming at jurors, 
while Mr Thompson’s family stormed out of the courtroom.

Describing the clash in a police interview, he said: ‘It was like a Rocky film where they both punch at exactly the same time.

‘But he threw the first punch. Then I flung my left hand out.

‘It was just a straight reaction, a defence mechanism - that’s what it was.

‘I didn’t even think. I just done it.’

Fatal blow: Anthony Thompson, 26, died after he was struck with a single blow and hit his head on the floor following argument at a party in Tooting Bec in February of 2012

Both men had been to a party at a one-bedroom third-floor flat in Holmbury Court, Tooting Bec, on February 5 last year.

Evans
 had spent the previous evening DJing at the nearby Bec Bar while Mr 
Thompson had been to a nightclub at the O2 Arena in North Greenwich.

The house party, organised by Vanessa 
Barrows, had started at around 4am and continued until 2pm, by which 
point Mr Thompson had fallen asleep in an armchair.

Spark: Vanessa Barrows told the court she drew the cartoon penis on his face using lipstick

Ms
 Barrows, who smiled and winked at Evans as she entered the witness box 
on crutches, said: ‘Some condoms fell out of his pocket. We had a laugh.

‘So I got my lipstick out and drew a penis on his face.’

Friend Marlon Fuller was also smeared with lipstick while he was sleeping.

Mr Thompson was not initially upset by the cartoon penis, but began boasting he could knock Evans out.

As the older man tried to leave, Mr Thompson followed him and squared up to him outside.

He continued to challenge his opponent and stripped off his top before delivering a glancing blow to his jaw.

Evans then punched Mr Thompson with enough force to send him crashing to the ground with his head spinning.

Prosecutor Peter Clement said: ‘This defendant didn’t know it but the expert evidence is that his first punch is likely to have been fatal.’

Mr Thompson was pronounced dead two days later and Evans handed himself into police the same day.

Evans, of Morden, south London, had denied manslaughter.
