Portugal's new coach Fernando Santos has lost his appeal against an eight-match FIFA ban for misconduct at the World Cup.

The former Greece coach was given his punishment for verbally abusing match officials during his team's World Cup clash with Costa Rica.  

FIFA says its appeal committee rejected Santos' challenge.

Santos can appeal again to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

He was hired by the Portuguese Football Federation on Tuesday despite being banned from the touchline for eight competitive matches.

Santos will serve the sanction during European Championship qualifying, though he can pick the team and attend training sessions.

It could rule him out of the entirety of Portugal's qualification campaign.  

Portugal appointed Fernando Santos to replace Paulo Bento after a difficult World Cup and poor start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign 

The manager took Greece to the World Cup knock out stages for the first time in their history

It was a defeat that cost former coach Paulo Bento his job after presiding over an awful World Cup 

The 59-year-old coach was sent to the stands during the second round game in Brazil. 

Santos was banished from the dugout after extra time, which finished 1-1. Greece then lost the subsequent penalty shootout.
