A husband and wife are facing charges over the death of the womanâ€™s elderly mother, after they allegedly forced her to live in a shipping container on their property, despite freezing conditions.

Michael Anglin 55, and his wife Jassy, 52, faced court in Queensland Australia yesterday where they were charged with culpable negligence occasioning the death of Janet Mackozdi, 78.

Ms Mackozdi died in July 2010 with the post mortem showing the most likely cause of death was hypothermia.

Michael and Jassy Anglin have been charged over the death of Jassy's 78-year-old mother, whom the couple allegedly forced to live in a shipping container on their property despite freezing conditions

The court heard that the couple housed the elderly woman in an uninsulated shipping container on their property in Tasmania, Australia, where temperatures dropped to minus three degrees Celsius.

Mrs Anglin and her husband of more than 20 years kept Ms Mackozdi in such conditions despite the fact that she required the same care as a two- or three-year-old child and required assistance bathing, eating, and using the toilet, the Cairns Post reported.

Police told the court that the couple washed and dressed Ms Mackozdi three hours after she died, before driving her to the hospital, rather than calling an ambulance as part of an elaborate ploy to mislead authorities about the nature of her death.

The couple allegedly told a nurse that they had taken Ms Mackozdi for a trip to a national park, but she died a short time later.

The accused pair moved from Tasmania to a beachside suburb in Queensland four years ago.

At the hearing yesterday, they were denied bail and flown back to Tasmania under police escort, with Magistrate Anthony Gett saying they posed an unacceptable flight risk due to the seriousness of the charge and the strength of the case against them.

The case continues at Court of Petty Sessions at Hobart on Friday.
