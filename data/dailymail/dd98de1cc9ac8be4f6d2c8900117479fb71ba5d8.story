Hi beauty buddies, welcome back to BBB!

The weather’s been a bit unpredictable here in England recently. One minute it’s gloriously sunny, the next there’s hailstones hammering down over our heads! I know which side of it I prefer…

Anyway, it’s nearly June and hopefully we’ll be seeing some serious sunshine soon.

Summer is the time for bold, bright colours, and so I’ve taken inspiration from the fresh, minimalistic make up looks on the Giles and Missoni S/S ‘13 catwalk shows to create this fabulously wearable summer 'pop' lip.

Pop it! Summer is the time for bold, bright colours, says Binky, who has taken inspiration from the fresh, minimalistic make up looks on the Giles and Missoni S/S '13 catwalk shows for this bright lipped look

Here’s how I did it.

To start off, I applied the Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation and Concealer. The foundation itself has a great creamy consistency – it’s not too thick and provides the perfect amount of breathable coverage for the daytime.

I put a little bit on the back of my hand and dabbed it gently onto my face using my fingertips. I wanted a fresh, dewy base for this look, so this product was the ideal choice; it gives skin a gorgeous radiant glow without looking too caked-on. 

 

How To Do A Hot Pink Lip With Binky

This look is all about the lips, so naturally I didn’t want to go overboard with my eye make up. A touch of white eyeshadow was all I needed to define the eye area and make me look more awake – I opted for the light shade from the Guerlain 6 Couleurs Eyeshadow palette.

Using a small brush, I swept a small amount of the shadow onto my eyelids and tear ducts. This helps open up the eyes without drawing attention away from the main attraction – the lips!

Following this, I brushed a coat of Guerlain Maxi Lash mascara onto my lashes for a hint of definition. This mascara is great for lengthening and curling the lashes; I applied just enough to give my lashes a natural looking flutter.

When wearing matte lipstick, particularly in a colour this bold, it’s essential to make sure the lips are prepped beforehand so you get a perfect, long-lasting finish.

I used the bareMinerals Loud and Clear Lip Sheer in Tangerine Trance to do this; it’s a gorgeous lip balm which moisturises the lips and provides a smooth base for which to apply lipstick, as well as helping the colour stay put for longer.

After making sure my pout was primed to perfection, I liberally applied Daniel Sandler Luxury Matte Lipstick in Gigi for a super-vibrant pop of pink. This lipstick is the ultimate in show-stopping colour; it’s a bright fuschia with blue undertones – you certainly won’t go unnoticed with this shade!

I then went back to the Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation and Concealer and dotted a little bit of the concealer around my lips to cover up any mistakes I had made. I also dabbed some on my Cupid’s bow to make my lips look fuller and more voluptuous.

For the finishing touch, I swept a teeny bit of the Clarins Skin Illusion Powder across my cheekbones to give a subtle glow.

If you’re working on a budget, here are some fab alternatives you can use to recreate this look:

Rimmel Wake Me Up Foundation

MUA Pearl Eyeshadow in Shade 2

Maybelline Great Lash Mascara

Vaseline Lip Therapy Lip Balm

Rimmel Moisture Renew Lipstick in Funtime Fuschia

MUA Undress Your Skin Highlighting Powder

So there you have it – a gorgeous summer pop lip that works brilliantly for day or night. Now all I need is some sun….

Until next time,
