A Silicon Valley suburb is quietly transforming from a sleepy community of summer cottages and apricot orchards into an ultra-affluent utopian society for tech executives.

Los Altos, California, before best known as the place where Steve Jobs built the first Apple computer, is changing thanks Sergey Brin, Google's 38-year-old billionaire co-founder.

Brin is reportedly revamping the city
in his own image by bankrolling a real estate investment firm that has 
been scooping up properties in the municipality of about 30,000 people.

'Los Altos is being transformed,' Ron Labetich, a longtime Los Altos real-estate broker, told The Wall Street Journal.

Passerelle Investment Co. is causing a stir in Los Altos by renovating properties and, in some cases, charging below-market rents to mom-and-pop businesses that cater to the tech set making their home there.

But Brin, who is reportedly worth about $17billion, is not alone. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a nonprofit created by the late Hewlett-Packard Co. co-founder and his wife, has also kicked in to the effort as well, The Journal reports.

The developments include plans by Passerelle to build a hotel and office space on a property it co-owns with the city of Los Altos

Passerelle Investment Co. is 'now the 500-pound gorilla downtown,' Los Altos Mayor Val Carpenter tells The Journal in a recent story on the topic, adding that the firm's moves have 'energized' the town.

You can get a sense of what Passerelle has in mind for the once-sleepy town from its website, where it states its philosophy in utopian terms.

'We approach real estate development from a socioeconomic perspective. Our investment analysis weighs financial return as well as social and environmental benefit,' the firm says.

'Ownership...requires a heightened sense of obligation and responsibility. Decisions go beyond one’s own portfolio because they affect the community, surrounding commercial and residential space, fellow building owners and the future of the downtown.'

Brin, who makes his home in nearby Los
Altos Hills, has, through Passerelle, purchased at least a half-dozen 
properties in the town in the last three years, The Journal reports.

So
far, the firm has reportedly brought in businesses that cater to 
families, such as a children's bookstore, a children's "playspace" and a
cafe called Bumble that has a supervised children's play area and 
sandbox.

He also told The Journal the firm has lent a helping hand to some tenants, including himself, by temporarily reducing rents when city construction clogged up a nearby street, making it harder to reach the stores.

Admittedly, Los Altos's real estate revolution is taking place apart from Brin's efforts. Forbes reportedly recently ranked the city as the 24th-most expensive ZIP code in the entire U.S. with the average home being hawked for more than $2.5 million.

The town's ethnic makeup is reportedly 70.6 per cent white, 0.5 per cent African-American, and 23.5 per cent Asian, according to the 2010 Census. The town boasts just under 11,000 homes, of which the vast majority are families of about three people.

The town also boasts some of the best public schools in the U.S. with a large per centage of students eventually matriculating to top universities.

Frederic Sischka, owner of Fast Frame 
of Los Altos, a picture-framing shop in a large building bought by 
Passerelle in 2010, told The Journal the firm has helped to prepare Los 
Altos for the recent influx of younger parents with kids.

'The Passerelle crowd had a vision that there needed to be things for younger people to do,' he reportedly said.

City officials told The Journal they were willing to work with Passerelle to draft proposals for redevelopment of a parking plaza jointly-owned by both the city and Passerelle.

Kid-Friendly: The 'Passerelle set,' as one local referred to people connected with Brin's firm, has been encouraging child-friendly mom-and-pop shops to set out a shingle in the company's properties

Transformation: Once known as a summertime haven of orchards and quaint cottages, Los Altos is now home to one of the most affluent ZIP codes in the entire U.S.

City council members have been more skeptical about the firm's separate proposal to replace 18 parking spaces with a public 'gathering space' behind one of its buildings.

Los Altos is also the beneficiary of other downtown real-estate ventures. Earlier this summer, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation opened its modern, energy-efficient headquarters building in downtown Los Altos.

Labetich told The Journal the city's leaders set the stage for downtown's rebirth several years ago when they increased the height limit of commercial buildings in the district and expanded the sidewalk areas in front of stores, among other infrastructure improvements.

He also noted to the paper that other developers are trying to build a shopping area downtown or are planning dozens of townhouses and condos nearby.
