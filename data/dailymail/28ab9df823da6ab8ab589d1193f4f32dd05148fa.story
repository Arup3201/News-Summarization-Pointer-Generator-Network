It was once an eagerly anticipated new block of flats, built to help with the housing crisis in Hull and standing as the city's tallest building.

But in a mere eight seconds Highcourt, a 20-storey tower block measuring more than 190ft high in the Orchard Park estate of Hull, was flattened to leave just a pile of rubble behind.

People lined the streets to watch the demolition, which took place almost 50 years after the high rise was first built.

Highcourt, Hull's tallest building (left) containing flats, was demolished and turned into a pile of rubble (right) in just eight seconds

The tower was demolished using explosives on Sunday afternoon. 

It was knocked down as part of a 'masterplan' for the state which will see a new shopping centre, a care home and affordable housing built.

But for some people who had seen the vast tower block planned and built, the scale and speed of its destruction was a sad event. 

Samantha Clark, 58, said: 'I was a young girl living in north Hull when this block of flats was built.

Highcourt was built in 1969 to help with the housing crisis and extended over 19 floors but yesterday explosives were used to demolish it

The building began to topple to the right hand side as the explosives tore through the bottom section and dust and rubble collected

As the tower began to fall huge plumes of smoke and clouds of dust were seen coming from the building as it clattered towards the ground

In seconds the 190ft high building fell towards the ground to make way for a planned new estate that will see new houses built

Eight seconds after the explosion the tower block was no more, and replaced by smoke and piles or rubble as workmen looked on

'I remember the new building being celebrated because there was a houses shortage at the time but now its demolition is being celebrated. It is quite emotional really.'

The tower was built in 1969 and stood as one of the tallest parts of the city, along with Hull Royal Infirmary.  

Jim Roles, 61, said: 'I can't believe that a block of flats that size, which took an age to build, could be demolished as quickly as that.

The 19 storey building was flattened to the ground on Sunday afternoon and workers will now have to begin clearing the large site

All that is left of Highcourt high rise is now large slabs of concrete and twisted metal after it was demolished within a matter of seconds

The tower block, shown previously, was built in the 1960s and was the tallest building in the city of Hull, as well as the infirmary

'One minute it was there, the next it was gone and that is that. It was an eyesore but I will miss it when I walk past every morning.'

More than 400 affordable homes are currently being built on the estate - many of which are being made more energy efficient.

Councillor John Black, of Hull City Council, said: 'It is an exciting time for residents of Orchard Park.

'Highcourt was one of the tallest buildings in the city along with Hull Royal Infirmary so it is a big deal that it is coming down but our masterplan for Orchard Park will improve the estate hugely.'
