Two hammer-wielding thugs have been captured on CCTV smashing 29 windows in an attack on a family house - and the victims have no idea why they are being targeted.

On one occasion, the men even threw sawdust, insects and a live mouse into the car of the concerned couple, who have one grown-up daughter.

Police have now issued the footage in a bid to trace the men, who have vandalised the house in Worsley, Salford, in Greater Manchester, several times.

The CCTV images, taken after the first 
incident at 1.30pm on March 20, clearly show the two hooded offenders 
walking around the house, on Alfred Avenue, with a hammer and breaking 
the windows.

Since then, there have been a number of other suspicious incidents that appear to target the same house.

On April 10, a person was seen trying to break into the property, before throwing a container of sawdust, insects and a live mouse into the householder's car.

The victims have told police they can think of no reason why they have been targeted and are becoming increasingly concerned.

Detective Constable Steve Powell, of 
Salford CID, said: 'This has been a disturbing turn of events for the 
victims who are at a complete loss to explain why they are being 
targeted in this way.

'Not surprisingly, the incidents are beginning to have a psychological effect on them and they are desperate for them to stop.

'With that in mind, I now want people to take a good look at the CCTV image.

'They are of excellent quality and have been circulated internally, but no one has yet identified them.

'We take this kind of persistent criminal damage and anti-social behaviour extremely seriously and I want to reassure residents that we are determined to tackle this.'
