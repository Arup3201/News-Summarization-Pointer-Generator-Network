Amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone  have been captured by an astronaut on the ISS.

The incredible views of tropical cyclone Bansi were spotted in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius, when the ISS was east of Madagascar.

The calm ‘eye’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling  clouds as it made its way across the ocean.

The images were taken by Italian European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti aboard the ISS earlier this month.

Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that develop in the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere. They produce gale force winds of about 39mph (63km/h) on average and rotate in a clockwise direction.

If the winds reach 73mph (118km/h), the system is called a severe tropical cyclone. The strongest winds are always near the eye, but damaging winds can extend hundreds of kilometres from the cyclone’s centre.

Cyclones form in warm oceans when sea-surface temperature exceeds 26.5C and there are favourable wind conditions.

They can persist for several days but lose their energy when they move over land or colder oceans, or are disrupted by another wind system. 

They show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye.

According to Nasa, the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds.

The low-light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast.

‘It looks like the storm is powering up some sort of weapon!’ said Phil Plate at Slate.

One image also shows a thin green line over the horizon known as airglow, which occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun.

The camera again accentuates this effect, which is an atmospheric phenomenon frequently seen by astronauts.

Stars appear above the airglow layer, and the solar panels of a docked Russian spacecraft jut into the image.

Tropical cyclone Bansi formed in the southwestern Indian Ocean on 11 January this year.

By the time Cristoforetti's photos were taken, on the following day, Bansi had achieved tropical cyclone strength, with sustained maximum winds over 115 miles (185km) per hour.

The cyclone would reach category 4 strength before becoming a weak extra-tropical system on 19 January.

Another image by Cristoforetti (shown) also revealed a green line of 'airglow' above Earth near the cyclone, with part of a Russian spacecraft also in the image. Airglow occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun. Bansi formed on 11 January and became a tropical cyclone before weakening by 19 January

Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, pictured, was born in Milan, Italy on 26 April 1977. She was selected as an Esa astronaut in May 2009 and, on 23 November 2014, she launched on her first mission to the ISS aboard a Soyuz spacecraft as part of Expedition 42

On 15 January at 6.15am UTC (1.15am EST), Nasa's Terra satellite captured this visible picture of tropical cyclone Bansi east-northeast of the island of Mauritius
