A photographer captured the moment a bold fox greeted his human visitors by nibbling on a woman's head in an unusual display of affection.

The fox approached a group of photographers after spotting them as they explored the British Wildlife Centre, in Surrey.

The images were captured by photographer Megan Lorenz, 38, after she spotted the fox affectionately chewing the hair of a fellow photographer.

Greeting: This fox offered an unusual display of affection by biting a photographer's head

'Affectionate': The fox slowly approached the group of photographers during a workshop at the British Wildlife Centre

Tame: Foxes are usually suspicious of strangers, but this inquisitive fox approached his human visitors

She said: 'The fox began softly chewing on another photographer's hair.

'As scary as most people would find it, I wished it had been me that had that incredible experience.

'This encounter happened while I was on a photographic group workshop at the British Wildlife Centre.

'One of the foxes got a bit curious and walked over to investigate.

Captive: The fox was soon distracted and went to re-join another fox in the enclosure

'I didn't want to startle it as they can be very timid even when they are captive animals.

'So I didn't move from where I was standing, but instead I took a couple of photos to remember the moment.'

Although foxes are usually suspicious of strangers, this inquisitive fellow slowly walked up towards the visitor, and began to gently nibble away at her hair.

Ms Lorenz said: 'The fox was soon distracted by an employee at the centre and moved away to re-join another fox in the enclosure.

'Incredible moment': Ms Lorenz said she wished it had been her that the fox greeted

Bonds: While foxes are not normally fond of humans they can form bonds with cats and dogs

'I think the young woman breathed a bit of a sigh of relief as the fox wandered away from her.

'It's best to leave wildlife wild, this was a captive fox but if it was wild, it's always best to keep your distance.'

Although not fond of humans or most other animals, foxes can in fact form an unlikely bond with cats and dogs.
