Astronauts making a rare, hastily planned spacewalk replaced a pump outside the International Space Station today in the hopes of plugging a serious ammonia leak.

The prospects of success grew as the minutes, then hours passed and no frozen flecks of ammonia appeared. Mission Control said it appeared as though the leak may have been plugged, although additional monitoring over the coming weeks will be needed before declaring a victory.

'I will tell you that we're happy. We're very happy,' said Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy space station program manager.

Spacewalk: Astronaut Chris Cassidy took photos as he worked on repairs to the ISS on May 11, 2013. Cassidy and crewmate Tom Marshburn are believed to have repaired the dangerous ammonia leak

Concern: NASA emphasized that the lives of the multinational crew were not in danger but both Russian and US space experts were scrambling to swiftly fix the problem

Ammonia: Astronauts discovered a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system

'We didn't see any obvious signs of a leak, but it's going to take some 
time...for us to look at the system, evaluate the system and make sure
we did, indeed, stop the leak.'

Montalbano expects it will take 'a good four weeks, five weeks, maybe even a few weeks longer.'

'Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,' he told reporters.

Christopher
Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn installed the new pump after removing the 
old one suspected of spewing flakes of frozen ammonia coolant two days 
earlier.

They uncovered 'no smoking guns' responsible for the leak and 
consequently kept a sharp lookout for any icy flecks that might appear 
from the massive frame that holds the solar panels on the left side.

'Let
us know if you see anything,' Mission Control urged as the fresh pump 
was cranked up. Thirty minutes later, all was still well. 'No snow,' the
astronauts radioed.

'We have our eyes on it and haven't seen a thing,' Marshburn said.

NASA
said the leak, while significant, never jeopardized crew safety.

The
space agency never before staged such a fast, impromptu spacewalk for a
station crew. Even during the shuttle program, unplanned spacewalks 
were uncommon.

The
ammonia pump was the chief suspect going into Saturday's spacewalk. So 
it was disheartening for NASA, at first, as Cassidy and Marshburn 
reported nothing amiss on or around the old pump.

'All
the pipes look shiny clean, no crud,' Cassidy said as he used a long, 
dentist-like mirror to peer into tight, deep openings.

'I can't give you any good data other than nominal, unfortunately. No smoking guns.'

Engineers
determined there was nothing to lose by installing a new pump, despite 
the lack of visible damage to the old one. The entire team - weary and 
stressed by the frantic pace of the past two days - gained more and more
confidence as the 5 1/2-hour spacewalk drew to a close with no flecks 
of ammonia popping up.

'Gloved
fingers crossed,' space station commander Chris Hadfield said in a 
tweet from inside. 'No leaks!' he wrote a half-hour later.

Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada has tweeted that the problem, while serious, has been stabilized

Crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station on Thursday

Flight
controllers in Houston worked furiously to get ready for Saturday's 
operation, completing all the required preparation in under 48 hours. 
The astronauts trained for just such an emergency scenario before they 
rocketed into orbit.

This area on the space station is prone to leaks.

The
ammonia coursing through the plumbing is used to cool the space 
station's electronic equipment. There are eight of these power channels,
and all seven others were operating normally.

'We
may not have found exactly the smoking gun,' Cassidy said, 'but to pull
off what this team did yesterday and today, working practically 48 
straight hours, it was a remarkable effort on everybody's behalf.'

NASA
officials remain mystified as to why the leak erupted. Ammonia already 
had been seeping ever so slightly from the location, but the flow 
increased dramatically Thursday.

Montalbano
did not know, as of Saturday evening, how much ammonia was lost. 
Another spacewalk will be needed to replenish the supply.

With
the repair work behind them, the astronauts and ground controllers 
turned their attention to the impending departure of three of the six 
crewmen.

Marshburn
has been on the space station since December and is set to return to 
Earth late Monday, along with Hadfield, a Canadian, and Russian Roman 
Romanenko. Cassidy is a new arrival, on board for just 1 1/2 months.

By coincidence, the two Americans performed a spacewalk at this troublesome spot before, during a shuttle visit in 2009.

'This
type of event is what the years of training were for,' Hadfield said in
a tweet Friday. 'A happy, busy crew, working hard, loving life in 
space.'
