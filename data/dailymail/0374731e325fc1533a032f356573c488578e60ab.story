Twice as fast: Dymista treats hay fever symptoms of a running nose, sneezing and itchy eyes

A nasal spray that claims to treat hay fever twice as fast as existing medication has been launched as pollen levels hit a springtime peak.

Dymista spray contains two drugs which work differently to treat the misery-making symptoms of a runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes.

It combines a corticosteroid and an antihistamine – normally taken as tablets – which scientists say work more effectively together than alone.

Trial data of 4,000 patients shows the spray relieves symptoms within five days, up to three days faster than when the drugs are used individually.

Until now the medications have been prescribed separately. From today the Dymista combination will be available from GPs and specialist doctors, although not all hay fever patients are likely to get it.

Around one in four people has hay fever – also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis – but the spray is targeted at moderate-to-severe sufferers.

It will be a matter of clinical judgement whether a patient's symptoms are bad enough to qualify for the spray, which will cost the NHS £19 for a month's treatment.

With the Met Office forecasting high pollen levels throughout England on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, many sufferers will discover whether their current medication works.

Maureen Jenkins, of charity Allergy UK, said: 'People often think of hay fever as a 'nuisance' condition, causing little more than a runny nose and itchy eyes.

Relief: 'Many people cannot control their symptoms, despite the wide range of treatments available'

'Unfortunately, the reality is that 
hay fever and allergic rhinitis can have a prolonged impact on quality 
of life by preventing people from sleeping, working, studying and even 
carrying out simple everyday tasks.

'Many
people cannot control their symptoms, despite the wide range of 
treatments available. These people should talk to their doctor or a 
specialist to assess the severity of their disease and receive adequate 
treatment for symptom control.'

Previous research found schoolchildren severely affected by symptoms risk dropping a grade in summer exams.

The Dymista spray contains azelastine, which blocks natural substances called histamines that trigger allergic symptoms, and fluticasone to reduce swelling and inflammation in the nasal passages.

Among possible minor side effects is drowsiness, nasal dryness and mild nosebleeds, although the majority of users are unaffected.

Allergy: The recent sunny spells have 'rapidly brought different pollens into play', experts have said

Patients taking Dymista should expect it to work within five days – up to three days faster than when single drugs are used.

Dr Glenis Scadding, consultant physician in rhinology and allergy, at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital in London, said hay fever sufferers should get treatment as early as possible, particularly given the delayed start to the season.

The recent sunny spells have rapidly brought different pollens into play, she said, adding: 'This new spray offers a novel approach because we know that antihistamine given via the nose is twice as effective as oral treatment, and when given with a steroid they work together remarkably well.

'I really hope GPs will use this for patients with the worst symptoms – they tend to be those that end up in their surgeries in despair because they can't control them with over-the-counter products.'
