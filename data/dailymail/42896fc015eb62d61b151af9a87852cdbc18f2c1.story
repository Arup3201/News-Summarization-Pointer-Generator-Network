Fusilier David Lee Collins, 18, from Manchester, who was stabbed outside the club in Ayia Napa in November 2012

The mother of a teenage soldier stabbed to death in Cyprus broke down in tears at an inquest as two of his killer’s friends refused to answer key questions over her son’s death.

Fusilier David Collins, 18, was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife as he tried to settle a nightclub dispute in the party resort of Ayia Napa, Cyprus.

He died without knowing his young girlfriend Aimee Williams was pregnant with his second child.

The 17-year-old delivered a healthy girl five months after his death.

David’s killer Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman, 20, originally from Somalia,
 but living in London, was jailed for eight years in Cyprus for manslaughter
 after claiming he was 'provoked' and ‘lost self-control’.

Two of Osman’s friends Umar Anwar and Tukki Abbas Shah, both 18 were initially arrested in connection with the killing
 but were later freed - even though 11 flick knives and two knuckle 
dusters were found in the hotel room they were all were sharing.

During an inquest in Stockport, Greater Manchester, on Thursday Lisa Minot, 38, was reduced to tears as the two men refused to answer questions and maintained her son had started an argument by asking the three men 'are you bad men?’

They claimed the statement was British slang for wanting a fight - but they refused to answer a number of questions after advice from a coroner that they did not have to say anything which could be incriminating.

Afterward Mrs Minott said: 'We are disappointed that Anwar and Shah who were involved in the incident which led to David’s killing decided to rely on their right not to answer some of the questions which were potentially self-incriminatory rather than give the inquest a full and true account of what happened.

'This has left us with unanswered questions, in particular about the motives for this senseless killing.

'We know that nothing can bring David back. Our primary concerns throughout the process therefore has been that nothing like this ever happens again.'

At the time of his death in November 2012 David was based at a British Army base at Dhekelia and had traveled to Ayia Napa to go clubbing with army colleagues as a final celebration before flying to Afghanistan the following day.

While in Club Black 'N White, friends from the 2nd Batallion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers saw David, of Chorlton, Manchester, mopping blood from his face after he said he was punched.

David approached Osman and his two friends and a scuffle broke out. Fusilier James Sullivan and another soldier - Fusilier Jordan Ramsbottom - attempted to diffuse the situation but David was ejected from the club by security.

While outside, Mr Ramsbottom noticed that David’s t-shirt was covered in blood and he had a one inch stab wound close to his heart. He collapsed at the scene and was pronounced dead by paramedics who attended.

Mr Ramsbottom told the hearing: 'I saw David and he was dancing but he was holding his face because it was bleeding. I went to the bar to ask for tissues. Someone had punched him and I asked who and he said he didn’t know but was going to find the guy and ask.

'He said it happened on the dance floor. He walked across and I saw him speaking to a dark-skinned man and we followed towards where he was. While they were talking two other guys approached and started shouting at David and attacked him.

'Three of them surrounded him and jumped on him at once. We tried to break it up and the security took David outside. I followed him outside and he asked me whose blood was on his clothes. He had a lot of blood on his t-shirt and it was sticking to his chest.

'Something was not right. I checked under his t-shirt and could see a hole in his chest one inch wide. I could see his muscle through the hole.

'I picked his t-shirt up to have a better look and could see muscle and tissue. I started to shout at people to get an ambulance. David tried to walk and talk but he couldn’t. He was dizzy.

'We just wanted to enjoy our night because it could be our last for a long time.'

Speaking in a quiet mumble, Anwar said: 'I was on the dancefloor having a chat and a cigarette - I had no problems with anyone.

'A white stocky male approached me and tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I ‘was bad’ and repeated it and I could see him clenching his fists so I pushed him away then he punched me in my face and I fell to the floor.'

Anway rejected allegations he knew Shah had picked something up - believed to be the knife - from the back of a quad bike they had used to travel. He also refused to answer questions on whether he knew the knuckle dusters and knives were in the hotel room.

Shah said David approached him and a quick discussion followed before Anwar was punched in the face and a fight broke out. But he could not recall anything after the event until he went outside the club and saw revellers stood around David.

In a statement to the inquest, Osman said: 'A huge guy and two more men approached me and said they were from Manchester and started fighting with us.

'They began punching us on the dancefloor. I tried to defend myself and hit him back.

'Because of that I pulled a knife from my pocket and put it to his face. He wasn’t scared and jumped towards me to attack me.

'That was the moment the knife stabbed his chest. 'That was when I realised what happened and the security came and pulled him out. I saw him on the floor injured.'

Osman later retracted the statement and claimed he was in fact stabbed in the hand. However he pleaded guilty to manslaughter before trial and a murder charge was dropped.

Reaching a conclusion of unlawful killing, South Manchester coroner John Pollard said; 'There was an altercation that led to what I feel can only be described as an unprovoked punch to David Collins' face.

'I think it’s fair to say that David wanted to sort it out and find out why he had been hit.

'He went over to the three men and I suspect started talking to them and it is my view his colleagues were ready to assist him.

'There is a further scuffle and there is no doubt in my mind that Osman stabbed him with this knife he had in his possession.'

At Osman’s sentencing hearing in Lanarca it was claimed Osman had bought two brass knuckles and 11 switchblades as 'souvenirs' to take back home and give to friends.
