Only three in ten people with a common mental illness such as depression get treatment, a leading psychiatrist has said.

Professor Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that some youngsters with mental health issues get ‘literally no’ treatment.

Prof Wessely told a newspaper, in his first interview since taking up the post in June, that the nation would not tolerate it if these figures related to cancer care.

The expert said that in some areas patients are routinely waiting for up to two years for care.

He told The Guardian: ‘People are still routinely waiting for - well, we don't really know, but certainly more than 18 weeks, possibly up to two years, for their treatment and that is routine in some parts of the country.

‘Some children aren't getting any treatment at all - literally none. That's what's happening.’

He said a larger proportion of people with severe mental illness have access to treatment but the figure still only stands at around 65 per cent.

Prof Wessely said that although the NHS has an aspiration to deliver parity of esteem between physical and mental health services, ‘the gap is now so big and yet there is no more money’.

He added: ‘If people really want true parity in the sense of actual 90 per cent of mental health patients are treated within 18 weeks, just like they are for other disorders, that is going to have to mean money will have to move from acute to mental health. Genuine money.

‘As there is no more money, that would mean significant losses in other sectors.’

The news comes after the death of actor Robin Williams, who was found hanged in his bedroom at his California home earlier this week.

The Mrs Doubtfire star was discovered by his personal assistant on Monday. Williams, 63, had grappled with severe depression and addiction.
