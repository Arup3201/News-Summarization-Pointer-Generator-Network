An artist is making a big impression with his tiny pieces of art.

Roy Tyson specialises in creating unique images and installations using miniature figures. 

Often he uses everyday props and taxidermy to create a humourous scene designed to be fun and intriguing.

Big ambition: Two golfers have a go at hitting this ball in Anything's Possible by Roy Tyson

In one piece, tiny forensic officers examine cigarette butts while in another fishermen cast their lines into a drain. 

All of the miniature figures, affectionately known as Roy's People, are hand painted to give them personality and charm.

The 26-year-old, from Stanford-le-Hope, in Essex, buys the figures and paints them before taking their pictures.

The pictures have been displayed in exhibitions and are on sale.

Roy Tyson is an artist making a big impression with his painted figurines

He recently told the Essex Echo that 
street art is his biggest influence. He said: 'I like Banksy and the way
he uses street art. 

'For me, the street art I do is just 
looking at things that are every day and seeing how little people can be
used to make these things look funny.

'It makes objects look different, 
it’s a mixture between things that are going on in the world and things 
that just pop into my head.'
