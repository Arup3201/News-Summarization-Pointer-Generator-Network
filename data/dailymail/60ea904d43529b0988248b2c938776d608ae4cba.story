It has long been seen as a destination for the more discerning shopper.

But it seems it isn't just the quality of the groceries that draws customers to Waitrose – it's how quickly they can buy them.

The supermarket has come top in a league table of how long shoppers spend queuing at the checkout.

Queue: Customers are irritated having to wait to pay for their groceries

On average it took a minute less to get to the till at Waitrose than at Morrisons, which came bottom of the list.

The supermarket, which is part of the 
John Lewis partnership, had an average queuing time of two minutes and 
51 seconds, just ahead of Asda, where shoppers can expect to wait six 
seconds longer, at two minutes and 57 seconds.

Tesco came third, with its queues 
lasting for three minutes and five seconds on average. Customers at 
Sainsbury's have to wait significantly longer, with a waiting time of 
three minutes and 47 seconds.

In last place was Morrisons, which had
an average queuing time of three minutes and 52 seconds, according to 
figures compiled over the past year by trade publication The Grocer.

The magazine carries out a weekly 
mystery shopping survey to track prices, service and availability at the
five leading grocery retailers.

Waitrose has been attempting to widen 
its appeal away from its upmarket image, with boss Mark Price saying he 
didn't want people to call the chain 'posh'.

Last month it pledged to match the cost of 7,000 products at Tesco, and it has also launched a cheaper Essentials range.

Speedy: Waitrose has the fastest queuing time of two minutes and 51 seconds

In May it emerged that Asda is trialing a new type of 'hybrid' checkout which could be the answer for time-strapped shoppers.

1. Waitrose 2 mins 51 seconds

2. Asda 2 mins 57 seconds

3. Tesco 3 mins 5 seconds

4. Sainsbury’s 3 mins 47 seconds

5. Morrisons 3 mins 52 seconds

The special till can switch from a check-out operated by a member of staff to a self-scan till in just a moment.

The chain thinks it could put an end 
to clock-watching customers reaching a till to find the 'This till is 
closed' sign displayed. 

Four hybrid checkouts have been trialled in Asda’s superstore in Keighley in West Yorkshire.

A spokeswoman for Asda said the trial
had gone 'very well' and that it would be rolling out the tills at 
another four superstores later this summer.

The biggest advantage of the hyrbids,
which can be used by customers with trolleys as well as those with 
baskets, is that it will enable the store to have checkouts that are 
always open.

Self-scan tills first appeared in the UK in 2002 and were trialled by Asda and other supermarkets in 2003. 

But they quickly became notorious for frustrated shoppers by announcing the presence of 'unexpected items in the bagging area'.
