Having a father who is leader of the Liberal Democrats might be embarrassing enough.

But Nick Clegg's children also have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad-dancing in the kitchen  of their £1.5million townhouse to Meghan Trainor's hit 'All About That Bass'.

Becoming the latest political leader to lift the lid on his family life, Mr Clegg spoke about the 'very strong' bond with his wife Miriam and their three sons, and baulked at the idea of betting his family home on his re-election in May.

Nick Clegg revealed how he enjoys dancing in his kitchen, and admitted some of his collapse in support could have been avoided

David Cameron posed in his kitchen chopping tomatoes and carrots, Nicola Sturgeon showed off her top-of-the-range coffee machine.

But Mr Clegg suggested he uses his kitchen for dancing rather than cooking. Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Lib Dem leader said: 'We are very lucky to have a very strong [family]. 

'We both come from very strong, warm families and both of our families are large, boisterous, loud, warm families. 

'We do sort of dance together a bit, we were all dancing in the kitchen to All About the Bass the other day and I don't think my kids were very impressed by my dancing but I enjoyed it.'

He also revealed how his eldest son, Antonio, is almost too old for a fatherly kiss when he does the school run twice a week.

'He's 13… I still just get a little kiss in if I can,' Mr Clegg said.

Polls suggest the Lib Dems are heading for an electoral bloodbath on May 7, with Mr Clegg facing a battle to hang on to his seat in Sheffield Hallam.

He has repeatedly insisted the party will defy the 'cottage industry' of pessimism, but stopped short of betting the family home on his survival. 

He told ITV's Kate Garraway: 'I'd put a very healthy bet on it. Would I bet my house? That's slightly unfair on Miriam and the boys if it goes pear shaped… 

'Do I think it is essential to have Liberal Democrats around the cabinet table? Unsurprisingly I really, really do. 

'Politics is not for the faint hearted and what goes up, goes down, what goes down, goes up. You can't just give up.'

He admitted he has faced a 'topsy turvy' time in government, and some of his collapse in support could have been avoided. 

He said: 'I think some of it, I'm sure not all of it, but I think some of it is probably inevitable. If you, as the traditional third party in Government, go into coalition with one of the two bigger ones, it's just a highly controversial thing to do.'  

Asked if he likes David Cameron, Mr Clegg replied: 'Um, it's not like or dislike really. We've worked out how to work together I suppose, it's quite a business-like partnership.'
