These adorable baby flying foxes are orphans but they’ve been hanging out in a new comfy home with their own blankets, bottles and dummies.

The tiny Australian natives are being cared for at a special flying fox nursery at Wildlife Victoria in Melbourne, Australia.

Just weeks old, all have lost their mothers to various accidents such as being electrocuted while flying into power lines.

Tucked up tight: These orphaned fly foxes are being cared for by volunteers who are refilling formula bottles, rotating dummies (pictured in their mouths) and swaddling them in blankets

Wildlife Victoria volunteers are helping to keep them safe and healthy until they are old enough and strong enough to return to their colony.

The volunteers are working round the clock to refill formula bottles, rotate dummies and swaddle them in blankets to help them feel secure.

Imitate nature: Rescuers give the babies dummies to imitate their natural instinct to suckle to their mother's underarm nipple. During their first weeks of life, babies are completely dependent on their mothers and so share a very tight bond with them

Baby flying foxes have a very strong 
bond to their mother and are completely dependent on them in the first 
few weeks of life, clinging constantly to them for food, security and 
warmth. They are flightless at this time.

Rescuers often give babies dummies to imitate their natural behaviour suckling to their mother's underarm nipples.

The older orphans are also getting practice hanging on cables in the nursery.

The city of Melbourne has a flying fox population of around 6,000 – which can swell to more than 30,000 over summer when babies are born.

Until they're ready: The babies will be cared for at the special flying fox nursery until they are old enough and strong enough to return to their colony

When they grow up: When they are fully grown, flying foxes - Australia's largest bat - fly up to 31 miles every night in search of food

The bats fly up to 31miles (50 km) every night in search of food and disperse up to 60,000 seeds during their journey.

Their
 numbers have been decreasing in the neighbouring Australian states of 
New South Wales and Queensland which has led to a rising population in 
Victoria. Projects to plant more native trees in Melbourne and 
surrounding areas over the last 30 years has also attracted the bat 
species.

The flying fox is the largest bat living in Australia and grow to have an average wingspan of 1metre (3.2ft).

Fully grown: Adult flying foxes grow to have an average wingspan of one metre (3.2ft)
