Good Morning America correspondent Amy Robach's return to ABC has been pushed back from the previously announced date as the network was side-lined by the sudden announcement that their weather anchor would be leaving the show just days later.

Robach has been off the air since discovering via a televised mammogram that she had breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes. 

She had a double mastectomy and 13 lymph nodes removed, and sent a grateful email out to colleagues on November 22 announcing that she would be back on the small screen on December 2.

All smiles: Amy Robach, seen here on Wednesday, had a successful operation to remove the cancer and has told how it will be a long recovery process but she has yet to appear back on TV

High spirits: Robach said that while the disease has taken an emotional toll on her, she is determined to live to see her young children grow up and get back to work

Support: She tweeted this photo of she and Champion in the ABC studios shortly after GMA ended on Wednesday

That never happened as she did not appear on Monday's broadcast nor has she been seen on the program this week- even though she has been in ABC studios.

Instead, the GMA staff had to deal with a surprise departure as well as her planned return as it was revealed this weekend that longtime weatherman Sam Champion was leaving the network and headed to The Weather Channel to launch his own flagship morning show.

The news of Champion's departure only broke over the weekend and his last day on the news program was this morning.

ABC press representatives refused to comment on the timing of Amy's return in relation to Sam's sudden departure, only reiterating how well she is doing.

Robach made that point herself as she was pictured smiling as she entered the Manhattan offices of ABC this morning.

She followed that with a photo of her own- posting a picture of her hugging Champion behind the scenes this morning with a shirtless cardboard cutout of him in the background.

Last day: Sam Champion is leaving ABC after 25 years with the network and heading up a new show on The Weather Channel

Happy faces: The cast dedicated much of the last week to celebrating their departing comrade, never mentioning the fact that the return date for Amy Robach has been pushed back- and not for health reasons

'I love @samchampion soooo much... Especially his hot bod! #missualready,' she posted at 9.29am New York time.

Much of GMA on Wednesday was dedicated to Champion, with tributes, highlight reels and even the unveiling of a 100-square-foot mosaic of his face made entirely of marshmallows.

October 1: In front of millions of viewers, a hesitant Robach undergoes her first mammogram as part of GMA's Breast Cancer Awareness campaign. Host Robin Roberts, who is a breast cancer survivor herself, urged the 40-year-old correspondent to have the test.

October 30: Robach goes back to the doctor's office for further tests where they confirmed that she had two tumors in one breast, abnormal cells in the other and 13 cancerous lymph nodes.

November 14: She underwent a bilateral mastectomy. They were able to save her nipples and doctors inserted expanders behind her chest muscle to stretch the area before inserting implants in a few months with a second surgery.

November 22: Robach writes an emotional and upbeat memo to ABC staffers saying she is 'excited' to be back at work on December 2.

The weekend of November 30 and December 1: News that Sam Champion will be leaving ABC to work at The Weather Channel.

December 2: Champion and the GMA co-hosts confirm the news during the show, lavishing him with praise and wishing him the best. Robach does not appear on air.

December 4: Champion's last day is celebrated throughout the program. Robach tweets a photo of she and Champion hugging backstage.

The spectacle for Champion was thrown together over the weekend, and was publicly announced on Good Morning America on Monday where his co-hosts lathered him with praise.

The effusive send off appears to be ABC's attempt to have the complete opposite situation that rival program The Today Show faced when one of their co-hosts, Ann Curry, left the show under significantly more tense circumstances.

In their efforts to make sure that Champion- and viewers- felt loved as he left, they effectively over shadowed the return of Robach.

On November 22, she wrote a memo to ABC staff proclaiming that while she had 'been through the ringer' with her cancer treatment, she was excited to return.

'As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work,' she wrote in the email.

That never ended up happening and she has not made an appearance on the air at all this week.

Media insiders are not the only ones noticing, as a number of Robach's Twitter followers responded to her photo this morning.

'How are you Amy. I thought GMA would give us an update,' a woman named Christine wrote.

'So nice to see you. Hope you are back on the air soon,' another user wrote.

The last-minute side-lining of Robach becomes even more pointed as this week's issue of People magazine begins to hit newsstands today, with the mom-of-five on the cover.

Under normal circumstances, GMA would have likely done a segment welcoming her back and tying it into the publication of her cover story.
