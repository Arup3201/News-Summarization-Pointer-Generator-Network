Opera isn't normally a field associated with animal cruelty, but the two worlds have collided in China after a singer posted pictures of herself wearing a headdress made from kingfisher feathers. 

Web users and conservationists quickly criticised her indifference towards animal welfare after it emerged the accessory was made from the feathers of no less than 80 of the colourful birds, according to the People's Daily Online.

Outcry: Opera singer Liu Guijuan is heavily criticised for showing off her headdress (pictured) made with feather from 80 kingfishers 

Peking opera singer Liu Guijuan wrote in her post on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, that she had bought the rare headpiece more than a decade ago for 120,000 yuan (£10,775).

'It is made with the feathers from under the wings of 80 kingfishers,' she said the post.

Miss Liu, a well-respected opera artist from Tianjin city, said the current market price for the headdress is no less than 400,000 yuan (£42,583). 

She added that she is often envied by fellow artists at the backstage for wearing such pieces. 

The post immediately attracted attention of Chinese animal lovers, who said art shouldn't come at the cost of sacrificing innocent birds.

'I feel like these people should step down. Who wants to see you if you build your art upon animal's suffering. We would rather you get out!' Commented one web user.

But there were some supportive voices too. 

'Liu Guijuan has followed industry rule and the headdresses are just for performing purpose, it has nothing to do with environmental protection,' wrote one unnamed web user.

Others suggested that artists could just as easily use fake feathers to create realistic costumes.

Victim: Two of the 11 types of kingfisher in China are protected species

Faced with public outcry, Miss Liu initially didn't back down.

She replied in her comments: 'I'm doing this in respect to art. In order to buy the best (headdress), I'd rather spend more money and use more kingfishers.' 

She also indicated that Chinese Peking opera master, Mei Lanfang, used to collect headpieces with feathers from  kingfishers.

However, she took down her original post not long after.

Two of the 11 types of kingfisher in China are protected species.

People's Daily Online reported in the same article that the police authority in Guangdong seized nearly 60,000 dead kingfishers last October.

But no further information was released on what these kingfishers had been killed for.
