Police were posted at the gates of a primary school after a jealous mother confronted a teacher over claims she had an affair with her husband.

Debbie Cavanagh is said to be furious at the member of staff, who she used to consider a friend, because she believes she had a seven-month relationship with her partner.

After making the allegations, the mother, who is in her late 20s, began sending threatening messages to parents and staff at the school.

She then decided to have a showdown with the teacher, prompting officers to be sent to Duddingston Primary School in Edinburgh as a precaution.

The teacher, who is off work but has not
 been suspended, strongly denies the affair.

Despite the altercation, Police Scotland have said no further action is being taken by officers, but education chiefs from Edinburgh City Council are said to have begun an investigation.

Mrs Cavanagh has condemned what she has seen as a failure to take action against the staff member, believing she should be suspended from her post.

But she was tight-lipped about the alleged meeting she had with her supposed love rival.

Wearing a pink hoodie and speaking outside her home in the Scottish capital, Mrs Cavanagh said: 'My husband admitted he had the affair and gave a statement to the education board.'

Scene: Officers were stationed outside Duddingston Primary School in Edinburgh after the angry showdown

Asked about the confrontation with the
 teacher, she said: 'I won’t confirm or deny that it happened, but I 
will say that it's the kind of thing that happens to dirty people.'

Mrs
 Cavanagh told a local newspaper she was convinced her husband had been 
cheating on her with the teacher between May and December last year.

She said she had even asked the teacher what she would do if she found out her partner was involved in an affair with another woman.

The teacher allegedly told her she would cut the other woman’s hair off.

It is understood that Duddingston Primary, which has a roll of around 380, became involved in the episode after Mrs Cavanagh sent threatening messages to teachers and parents.

Mrs Cavanagh added: 'I complained to the school and had a meeting with the head teacher and the business manager and my husband. He admitted it all.

Claims: The teacher in question has denied the alleged affair and Police Scotland has said no further action will be taken

'The business manager said, "Can we keep it between ourselves if the teacher apologises?".

'They said it could get very messy and wreck the school’s reputation. I said "over my dead body".

'I asked if she had been suspended and they said "no".'

A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed they received a report of antisocial behaviour against Duddingston Primary School on January 20.

'No further action has been taken.'

Regarding the allegation against the teacher, a spokesman for Edinburgh City Council said: 'A complaint has been received and is being looked into.'
