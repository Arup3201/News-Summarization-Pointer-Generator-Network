Confident: Edward Davey said Cumbria's withdrawal will not stop the waste management programme being successful

Britain’s long-term nuclear plans have been thrown into disarray after the only county willing to store radioactive waste pulled out of the running.

Cumbria County Council voted against studying the possibility of building a £12billion underground dump in the region, over fears it could damage tourism.

Ministers branded the decision disappointing, while unions representing nuclear workers said the move was ‘short-sighted’.

The decision is a blow to the coalition’s plans to develop a new generation of nuclear reactors, as it will have to either convince another authority to host the site or hope that Cumbria will change its mind.

Although radioactive waste is currently kept in surface storage, the Government is committed to creating a long-term underground facility.

It has also pledged that future nuclear power station would only be built if ‘effective arrangements’ for dumping were in place.

Proponents of nuclear power fear that without these plans for waste burial, any new stations would almost certainly be subject to legal challenges.

Speaking after yesterday’s decision, Cumbria council leader Eddie Martin said: ‘Cumbria is not the best place geologically in the UK - the Government’s efforts need to be focused on disposing of the waste underground in the safest place, not the easiest.’

He added: ‘Cumbria has a unique and world-renowned landscape which needs to be cherished and protected.

'While Sellafield and the Lake District have co-existed side by side successfully for decades, we fear that if the area becomes known in the national conscience as the place where nuclear waste is stored underground, the Lake District’s reputation may not be so resilient.’

If the area becomes associated with nuclear waste 'the Lake District's reputation may not be so resilient' says council boss

Cumbria Council Leader Eddie Martin said as Cumbria already has Sellafield nuclear plant, any more nuclear facilities in the area could damage the Lake District's reputation

Energy secretary Edward Davey said: ‘I am confident that the programme to manage radioactive waste safely will ultimately be successful, and that the decisions made in Cumbria today will not undermine prospects for new nuclear power stations.’

He added: ‘We remain firmly committed to geological disposal as the right policy for the long-term, safe and secure management of radioactive waste.

'We also remain committed to the principles of voluntarism and a community-led approach.’

Britain currently has ten nuclear power stations, generating a total of ten gigawatts of electricity, around 19 per cent of Britain’s electricity needs.

By 2023, all but one - Sizewell B in Suffolk - will have become obsolete. This could trigger an energy crisis, as one third of Britain’s old-fashioned coal-fired and oil-fired power stations will effectively be outlawed by environmental legislation at the same time.

In October, Japanese engineering giant Hitachi paid £700million to take on a project to construct plants in Wales and Gloucestershire, boosting Government plans for a new network of atomic power stations.

But Greenpeace energy campaigner Leila Deen last night warned that without adequate waste facilities, no new plants can be built.

‘Even the Prime Minister admits we need a plan to store waste before we can build a single new plant. This decision shows that dumping waste in uncertain geology near one of the country’s most pristine national parks is not a solution,’ she said.

‘Ministers must now re-consider their nuclear ambitions and turn their attention instead to clean, sustainable and renewable energy.’
