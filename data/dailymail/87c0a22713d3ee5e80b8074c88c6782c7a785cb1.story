The widow of a man who was murdered outside a preschool by her mentally-ill lover appeared in court yesterday, accused of lying under oath about their affair.

Andrea Sneiderman, from Atlanta, was initially accused of arranging her husband Rusty Sneiderman's killing but murder charges were later dropped. Her lover Hemy Neuman was convicted after telling police an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it.

Yesterday, Sneiderman's defense attorneys painted her out as a happily married mother devastated by her husband's death, not the woman prosecutors described as engaged in a 'forbidden romance' with her boss.

The contrasting portraits of Sneiderman emerged during opening statements in her trial on charges of lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's death.

DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury: 'The evidence will show a forbidden 
romance that ends in murder, silence despite her suspicion, and lies to 
conceal the truth from her family, from her friends, from the police and
from a jury.'

Sneiderman's husband, 36-year-old Rusty Sneiderman, was fatally shot in November 2010 outside a suburban Atlanta preschool while he was dropping his son off.

Neuman was convicted of the killing in March 2012, but he was found to be mentally ill.

He told mental health examiners 
he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an 
angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John.

The angel ordered him to 
fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview.

37-year-old Sneiderman has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any romantic relationship with Neuman.

DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury that evidence in the case will show that soon after Sneiderman took a job at General Electric, she formed a friendship with Neuman that quickly blossomed into a romantic relationship.

But because she was married with young children, she felt conflicted about it and was hot and cold with Neuman, Hill said.

Emails the state plans to present show 'she feels torn between her reality and her desires,' Hill said.

Andrea Sneiderman had willingly participated in a relationship with Neuman, sharing deep personal secrets with him, sending him photos of her children, and sharing kisses and other physical contact with him during business trips, Hill said.

But she failed to tell police about her relationship with Neuman and failed to tell them she suspected he might be involved, Hill said.

'If the police had known about the relationship, they would have known why someone wanted Rusty dead,' she said.

Sneiderman also lied under oath 
during Neuman's trial last year, denying the romantic relationship and 
lying about when she found out her husband had been shot, Hill said.

As
she was driving to the preschool after getting a call from an employee 
there about an emergency, she called her father-in-law and told him his 
son had been shot, even though no one had told her that yet, Hill said.

Defense
attorney Tom Clegg told jurors that Sneiderman told police the day 
after her husband's killing that Neuman had tried to break up her 
family.

She was happily
married, brushed aside advances from Neuman at work and never 
complained to human resources because she didn't want to create problems
for herself and couldn't imagine he would do harm, Clegg said.

'The
bottom line is Hemy Neuman was a pest, Hemy Neuman was a nuisance. Hemy
Neuman, to this woman, was not a threat,' Clegg said.

Sneiderman cooperated with police and suggested Neuman might have been involved, Clegg said.

She
was so broken up over her husband's death that, on what would have been
their 10th wedding anniversary, she put on her wedding dress and went 
to the synagogue in Florida where they got married, hoping to feel his 
spirit, Clegg said.

The
state called several witnesses on Monday, including a waitress who said
she served drinks to Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman in Greenville, South 
Carolina, in October 2010, and a hotel front desk clerk from Longmont, 
Colorado.

The state also showed several video clips of Andrea Sneiderman's testimony from Neuman's trial.

In one video clip, Sneiderman is shown talking about a business trip she and Neuman took to Greenville, South Carolina.

She
testified they had dinner and then went to a bar. They had one or two 
drinks, she got up and danced alone and then he joined her on the dance 
floor and twirled her, she testified.

They had no contact other than partner dancing, she said.

The
state called Christine Olivera, a bartender who was working that night.
Sneiderman seemed upset when they arrived and took her cellphone with 
her to the bathroom, Olivera said.

When
she came back to the bar, she had sipped her drink and seemed to cheer 
up, Olivera said. Neuman led Sneiderman onto the dance floor and after a
short while, Sneiderman danced flirtatiously, as if she were seducing 
Neuman, Olivera said.

Unusual urgings: During his trial, Neuman said that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it, as did a demon who sounded like Barry White

The
two kissed more than once and eventually left the bar in each other's 
arms, pausing to kiss on the sidewalk, Olivera testified.

In a video clip from Neuman's trial, 
Sneiderman is seen testifying that Neuman was in Longmont, Colorado, at 
the same time she was there for work in July 2010 and that she believed 
he was there for work. But in an email exchange from that time that she 
reads aloud, Neuman tells her he was not there for business.

When a lawyer asks her about that, she says she supposes he was there to see her, maybe to stalk her.

The state called Brady Blackburn, a front desk clerk from the hotel where Sneiderman stayed in Colorado.

In
an employee log from the hotel, there is a message from another clerk 
saying Neuman called and instructing Blackburn to read a short love note
to Andrea Sneiderman.

Blackburn
also testified that hotel records showed that he checked Sneiderman 
into her room and that her booking was modified from one guest to two.

Sneiderman was arrested at a home in 
Putnam County lat last year and was being held without bond.

Footage of Sneiderman dressed in khaki 
shorts and a long-sleeve shirt surrounded by law enforcement officials 
as she left the house was aired at the time, as she was handcuffed and 
placed in a patrol car.
