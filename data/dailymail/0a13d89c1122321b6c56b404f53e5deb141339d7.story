An Israeli hairdresser has created an 'invisible' skullcap made from human hair so Jewish men can cover their heads without fear of being targeted in anti-Semitic attacks. 

Barber Shalom Koresh fashioned the skullcap - or kippa in Hebrew - from hair samples to obscure wearers' identities as Jews following a rise in anti-Semitism in Europe.

The caps are proving particularly popular in France, Mr Koresh says, which has seen a spate of  attacks on Jews in recent years, including the recent killing of four Jews in the hostage stand-off at a kosher supermarket in Paris.

The hair pieces were created by barber Shalom Koresh, who has seen particular interest from Jews in France following that attacks in Paris

'This skullcap is washable, you can brush it, you can dye it,' Mr Koresh said in his salon in central Israel. 

'It was created so people could feel comfortable going to places where they are afraid to go, or places where they can't wear it, and feel secure.' 

The hairdresser's skullcap, which he calls the 'Magic Kippa', comes in different colours. Prices start at around £37 for synthetic hair while caps made from natural hair cost just under £60.

The skullcap, which can be washed and dyed, is fastened onto the wearer's real hair with hidden clips.

Maor Hania, who models the hairpiece at the salon, said: 'You don't feel a thing. It feels like it is part of your hair. There isn't such a difference between this and a regular kippa. It feels the same.'

Devout Jewish men traditionally wear skullcaps as a sign of respect and reverence for God. 

The kippas come in different colours and cost between £37 and £60 for either synthetic or natural hair caps

Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, who teaches at a prominent Jerusalem yeshiva, said that skullcaps must be visible but that Jews who were 'in danger' could conceal them.

Recent anti-Semitic attacks have deepened fears among Jewish communities in Europe, with many feeling vulnerable to discrimination.

The attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris saw terrorist Amedy Coulibaly kill Jews Yoav Hattab, 21, Yohan Cohen, 20, Philippe Braham, 45 and Francois-Michel Saada, 64. The bodies of all four men were flown to Jerusalem to be buried. 

Following the attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged European Jews to move to the Jewish state, saying he would welcome them with 'open arms'.

A 2013 EU report found that one in five European Jews avoid wearing kippas or other Jewish symbols for fear of being harassed or attacked. The skullcap could also serve Jews travelling to the Middle East, where some Arab countries can be hostile to Jews.
