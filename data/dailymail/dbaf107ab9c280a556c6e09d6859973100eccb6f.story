With dazzling flashes of green, blue and white, a mysterious object lit up the Utah sky early this morning.

It silently soared over the state at around 4.40am, seemingly lingering for a few seconds.

But while some excitedly rushed to report a UFO, one astronomer claims it was a burning meteor that was so far away it couldn't be heard.

Dazzling: It silently flashed brighter than the moon, lighting up the sky for a number of seconds

A video captured the a burning white ball's passage through the sky.

Seconds later, neighbours took to Twitter reporting flashes of blue and green.

One wrote on UFO Stalker: 'At approximately 4:43 am I was in my back yard having a cigarette. 

'The sky was crystal clear, and as usual I was looking up at the sky, looking at the Orion constellation. 

'Then in front of me I saw a bright green, white, blue, light with a tail. 

'Reminding me of a falling star, except much larger, and slower. 

Strange: The light slowly faded as the object drifted out of view slowly and steady as others saw it to be blue

'Then I thought of the meteor over Russia. As I watched this object, I had time to think how big it appeared, and that it was traveling silently. 

'It lasted several seconds, four to eight. As it moved across my field of vision the tail seemed to be sparking, or breaking off in pieces. 

'It was close enough that I expected to hear a crash, as it seemed to be traveling in a downward direction. 

'As it travelled (sic) behind structures and out of my sight, I thought I should go see if I could find it, thinking that it would have come down very close. 

'I did not go though. I do not know what it was. I know it was not a simple falling star. It was way to big, and moving way to slow.' 

Speck: It then inexplicably lost all its light before gradually lighting up again, which many said is like a UFO

Contradicted: An astronomer claims this behavior is typical of a bolide meteor which is about to combust

According to Patrick Wiggins, the NASA/JPL solar system ambassador to Utah, the variety of flashing colours is typical of a bolide meteor, which combusts at the end of its flight. 

It is caused by the rock cooling down as it passes through the atmosphere.

Once the bolide explodes, it will likely send pieces hurling down to earth - which could be very valuable.  

If nearby, the sheer pace of the bolide could be so loud it could crack windows

But Wiggins explained, despite shining brighter than the moon, it was lightyears away because it was silent.
