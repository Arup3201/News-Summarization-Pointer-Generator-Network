Police say a car crossed the center lane on a New York road and crashed head-on into a larger vehicle, killing four teenagers and leaving three other people with serious injuries.

The collision happened just after midnight Saturday in Farmingdale on Long Island.

Nassau County police say a 2001 Nissan carrying five teens was traveling west when it crossed into the eastbound lane and was struck by a GMC Suburban at about 12:04am.

Jesse Romero, Carly Lonborg, Tristan Reichle and Noah Francis were all killed in the tragic crash, reports the New York Post.

The impact threw two of the teenagers, all students at Farmingdale High School, from the car.

One, Cody Talanian, 17, survived but is in a critical condition at Nassau University Medical Center.

According to Newsday, the front of the SUV slammed into the passenger side of the Nissan, crushing the small car.

'It was 
really a horrific scene,' Farmingdale Fire Department spokesman 
Christopher Pieloch, who responded to the accident, told Newsday.

The
 two people in the GMC, a man, 53, and his female passenger, suffered 
serious injuries but are expected to survive, police said.

Both vehicles were impounded for brake and safety checks. The investigation is ongoing.

'My wife, she can’t believe it,' the father of Jesse Romero told the New York Post.

'She can’t talk much. My whole family, we are all shocked as she is. I can’t believe it either. They just came and gave us the bad news.'

Social workers and psychologists will be at Farmingdale High Monday to provide grief counseling to students and staff, she said.

The Reverned Michael Duffy of St. Kilian Church, which three of the young people attended, told the New York Post, 'We visited one of the families, we prayed with them. This is one of those days when your homily goes right out the window.

'There are no words when an event like this occurs.'
