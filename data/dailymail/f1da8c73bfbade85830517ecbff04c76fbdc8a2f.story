Roy Keane has been busy promoting his latest autobiography, The Second Half, by sniping at the numerous enemies he made during his career, but one former adversary has bitten back.

Ex-Liverpool midfielder Jason McAteer admits the pair 'don't get on' after he criticised the then Irish captain's infamous exit from the 2002 World Cup while clashing on several occasions during their playing days.

During a television interview with beIN Sports, McAteer recalled an incident while he was at Sunderland where he mocked Keane by telling him to 'Put it in your next book', which subsequently led to the former Manchester United captain being sent off for a malicious elbow in the final minutes.

It's revealed that McAteer's claims that the book refers to him as Keane's 'hero' is all an elaborate joke

The Irishman then proceeds to check if the fracas did indeed make it into Keane's second autobiography (it didn't) by reading an excerpt, which he claims praises him as being his foe's 'hero' and 'favourite' - before it's revealed that he had penned the quotes himself.

It's not the first time that McAteer has reacted to Keane's book after he previously tweeted: 'For someone who don't like the limelight Roy certainly knows were the the light switch is !!.'

Another former player on the receiving end of a proven pre-meditated attack by Keane, Alf-Inge Haaland, has also used social media to taunt his nemesis.

The former Leeds midfielder, who was infamously injured after a foul  in 2001 that ultimately led to a £150,000 fine and lengthy ban for Keane, temporarily tweeted 'Cant take a man seriously when hes got a beard like.... (alongside an image of a captured Saddam Hussein) in reference to the Aston Villa coach's then overgrown facial hair.
