Creepy details emerged today about the plot by a grown man to lure a 13-year-old girl he met over the internet across state lines.

Police charged Jorge Garzon, 45, with sexual assault, child endangerment and child abuse after Alexandra 'Allie' Loftis was found in his Jersey City apartment, and a neighbor's account of their interaction is shedding light on the relationship between the apparent ill-matched lovers.

Eduardo Morillo, who rents a basement apartment in the home Garzon lives in with his parents, testified that he met Allie when he was invited into Garzon's room to clear his computer hard drive.

Arrested: Jorge Garzon, 45, of Jersey City was arrested and charged with sexual assault, child endangerment and child abuse

Mr Morillo, a computer engineer, did not know why the grown man wanted to erase his hard drive, but was able to easily clear the drive.

Mr Morillo told The Jersey Journal that because the young girl looked happy and relaxed, he assumed she was a relative of Garzon, saying that they 'touched' and 'hugged' one another in a close way.

Little is known of Garzon except that he is divorced, lives with his parents, and a father of two.

'They were acting as if it was a family together,' Mr Morillo told the paper.

The truth is far more cringe-worthy.

Efforts: Family of Allie implored volunteers to take to street corners in matching T-shirts handing out fliers on their missing daughter, all around the city

Unsuspecting: Eduardo Morillo went into Garzon's room to erase his hard drive and thought Garzon and Allie were related

Mr Morillo only learned that the pair were not actually related when a journalist came to his door after Garzon was arrested and asked if he had seen the missing girl.

Police say Alexandra 'Allie' Loftis vanished from her Boston home for nearly two weeks after boarding a bus headed to New York City on November 4th, sending her parents on a relentless hunt to get their daughter back.

Allie was located at Jorge Garzon's Jersey City residence and taken into police custody around 9am Wednesday, after police say they received a tip off.

Garzon, who also goes by the name George Gonzalez, was arrested just over an hour after her recovery at the Jersey address.

After their daughter disappeared, Mr 
Loftis says she never turned on her cell phone or went on Facebook, 
despite him describing her as tech savvy.

'We have left voice mail messages on 
her cell phone until it got filled up. We’ve tried every method we think
 possible but haven’t heard from her,' Mr Loftis told CBS after her 
disappearance.

Pleading, in hope that she may see 
their efforts and pain online, the family devoted a Facebook site to 
their missing daughter, posting a flood of photos of them together.

That made it even more concerning for him, with his fear that Allie could have been held against her will.

Custody: Police say Allie took a bus from Boston Massachusetts to New York City, disappearing for nearly two weeks before she was found Wednesday in Jersey City

Her father did confess his believe that she may have met someone online.

Garzon, who Allie was found with, is 
currently being held in custody in the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office
 pending charges which have yet to be filed.

Affirming Allie's father's fear, the two are believed to have met online, a sources close to the investigation told NJ.com.

The circumstances surrounding both her
 disappearance and the activities since she ran away are still under 
investigation, according to police.

Adventure: Allie, shown with her father and mother, had expressed frustration and boredom with their quieter Massachusetts community to her father, possibly building up to her New York City escape

Search: Allie's parents searched all the areas of the city they thought their daughter might go, focusing on Brooklyn where they knew she was more familiar
