Vladimir Putin could control Europe or America if he were not so busy, according to Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone.

The pair, who have been seen together at recent sporting events, often defend each other’s viewpoints. But now the British billionaire has gone even further in praising Mr Putin, 62, during an interview with Russian newspaper Vedomosti.

Mr Ecclestone, 83, reportedly praised the Russian president – who is widely blamed for stoking the conflict in Ukraine in recent months – saying: ‘He’s [Putin’s] a first-class person. I always supported him.

‘He could control Europe or America; he is able to deal with it. But I think he is very busy. Let him finish what he’s doing and then we’ll see.’

The Formula One boss was spotted deep in conversation with Mr Putin in the hospitality grandstand at the Russian Grand Prix last weekend.

The two men are believed to have met several times over a deal that secured the Black Sea resort of Sochi as the venue for the event, Russia's first of its kind.

Moscow is reportedly paying £31million a year to Formula One, thought to be the highest ever grand prix hosting fee.

It is not the first time Mr Ecclestone’s comments concerning the Russian leader have caused controversy.

He previously spoke of his ‘great admiration’ for Mr Putin and said he ‘completely agrees’ with his views on homosexuality - which included advising gay athletes to stay away from children at the Winter Olympics - and said they had been misrepresented.

‘He hasn’t said he doesn’t agree [with homosexuality], just that he doesn’t want these things publicised to an audience under the age of 18,’ Mr Ecclestone told US broadcaster CNN.

‘I completely agree with those sentiments and if you took a world census you’d find 90 per cent of the world agree with it as well.’

Previously, Mr Ecclestone has expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler and said his friend Max Mosley, the son of British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, ‘would do a super job’, as prime minister, adding: ‘I don’t think his background would be a problem.’

Despite the controversies over the crackdown on rights in Russia, and the behaviour of Russian-backed militias in the Ukraine, Mr Putin has also retained the support of some British political figures.

Earlier this year, Scottish SNP leader Alex Salmond refused to apologise after he commended the Russian leader for ‘restoring a substantial part of Russian pride’ in a magazine interview.

The F1 boss said: 'He could control Europe or America; he is able to deal with it. But I think he is very busy'

Asked about whether he admired Mr Putin, the SNP leader said: ‘Certain aspects. He’s restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.

‘There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the intermesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire. Russians are fantastic people, incidentally, they are lovely people.’

While in March, Ukip leader Nigel Farage controversially said he respected Mr Putin more than the ‘kids’ who run Britain.

The Ukip leader said he did not like or trust Putin, or want to live in Russia, but claimed he was doing a better job on foreign policy than David Cameron and the foreign secretary, William Hague.

At the time, Deputy PM Nick Clegg condemned support for the Russian president as ‘utterly grotesque’.
