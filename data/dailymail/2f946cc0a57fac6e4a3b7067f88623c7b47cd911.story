A teenage father killed himself when his girlfriend discovered he was swapping obscene messages with a male teacher, a court heard.

Anthony Stubbs, 16, vanished following the confrontation with 18-year-old Charlotte Mason, who had just given birth to their daughter Lily. He was later found hanged in woodland.

The primary school teacher, 34-year-old Iwan Harding, appeared in court yesterday accused of sending him indecent messages.

The court was told he had asked Anthony about the size of his manhood, described him as a ‘horny lad’ and offered sex.

He also sent indecent images of himself to the teenager along with an explicit video of two men performing a sex act.

The pair met through Love Leap, a dating website.

Although users must be 18 to register, Anthony was able to set up an account under the tag ‘young, sexy gay’.

Julie Hughes, prosecuting, said Anthony went missing on November 24 last year following the argument with Miss Mason.

‘The messages themselves are obscene and indecent and, to an extent, that is conceded by the defendant in interview,’ she told Caernarfon Magistrates’ Court in north Wales.

Detective Sergeant Richard Horton, of Lancashire police, said that although Anthony’s body was not found until January 14 he had killed himself in woods near his Leyland home soon after he vanished.

His mobile phone showed he had contacted 14 people through Love Leap, including a 47-year-old Manchester man.

He also spoke to 12 others via the internet video telephone service Skype.

Tudur Owen, defending, said the case raised ‘issues of public concern’ because the Crown was alleging that the sending of salacious texts between two individuals amounted to a criminal act.

Mr Owen said: ‘It’s a tragic case [but] there were no fixed plans for the men to meet. A lot of it is effectively fantasy.’

Harding, who has been suspended by his school, accepted he sent images and a video to Anthony who, he said, had claimed to be 17.

But he denies sending grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages between October 7 and 19 last year.

District judge Andrew Shaw reserved his judgement until next month. He said he wanted more time to reflect because the case was an ‘important’ one which could have ‘substantial implications’ for future hearings.

Harding, of Llanberis, north Wales, was granted bail with a condition not to have unsupervised contact with a child under 18.

Anthony discovered he was going to be a father when he was 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born last September.
