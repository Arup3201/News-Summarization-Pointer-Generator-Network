Ross Barkley is the latest talent to come off the Everton production line and the club's Under 21s manager Alan Stubbs has seen the midfielder's remarkable rise first hand.

Both boyhood Blues, 'Stubbsy' believes it was just a matter of time before Barkley made it and hopes the youngster is selected in Roy Hodgson's 23-man England squad for this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Sportsmail spoke to the Toffees coach about Barkley's breakthrough, Everton's up-and-coming academy stars and the club's famous 'School of Science'.

Evertonians knew all about Ross Barkley before he burst onto the scene in the Premier League this season. Did you expect him to have such an impact?

Yeah, I did (laughs). Ross has had a big impact. I coached him for two or three years and he always stood out and has fantastic ability.

It has to be said the season he’s having comes two years on from breaking his leg. Ross may have made the breakthrough even earlier but for the injury. Whether it was this season or last, it was only a matter of time before he made it.

Flying high: Stubbs hasn't been surprised by the huge impact Barkley has made at Goodison Park this season

Proud: Barkley, pictured with Graeme Sharpe (left), scooped Everton's Young Player of the Season award

Do you think Barkley will make into Roy Hodgson’s 23-man England squad this summer and help lead the nation to World Cup glory?

For Ross to go to Brazil with England would be fantastic. How many 20-year-old lads can say they’ve been to the World Cup?

For me, not only as an Evertonian but also as an England fan it would be good to see him selected – I’ve been waiting for England to win the World Cup since 1971!

It’s Hodgson’s decision whether or not he’ll play and we have to respect that.

Everton have seen a number of talented youngsters make a name for themselves after coming through the ranks. Notably Wayne Rooney and now Barkley. What’s the club’s secret?

I think the biggest thing is the infrastructure at the club – the scouting, coaching and development of players. I think you also need that ‘luck’ element, too, to have players like Rooney and Barkley.

Everton’s record over the years and the number of players brought through speaks volumes.

Tyias Browning was named Everton’s Under-21s Player of the Season at the club’s End of Season awards on Wednesday night. How close is he to breaking into the first-team?

Tyias has progressed at a real rate of knots and I think he’s close. He just needs to keep doing what he’s been doing and has a great opportunity of breaking into that first-team.

Young midfielder Ryan Ledson also picked up an award and was named Academy Player of the year...

Ryan’s the baby, he’s only 16 but has been a real credit to himself. He’s made a few appearances for the Under 21s this season and for us that’s a bonus.

Sometimes you can be a bit cautious about the impact playing in those games can have but, physically, he’s coped. It bodes well.

Ryan’s one of a number of bright young players at Everton.

Meanwhile, Seamus Coleman scooped the main awards being named Player of the Season as well as the Player's Player award. Aged 20 when he joined the club in 2009, the Republic of Ireland international has had an excellent campaign...

In all honesty, nobody in their wildest dreams could have envisaged what Seamus has gone on to achieve when we first signed him for £60,000 from Sligo Rovers. 

All credit to Everton for scouting him. The club took a chance and he’s been a revelation. He’s a modern day full back; can score goals, attack and is a real handful.

Class act: Coleman is a modern day full back, scoring goals and being able to attack, according to Stubbs

Everton have had to deal with a number of injuries towards the end of this season meaning Browning, Ledson and Luke Garbutt have all made appearances on the bench. What advice do you give the younger players when they’re given the nod?

I tell them to go and enjoy it but to not forget the reasons which got them there. The fact you’re on the bench doesn’t mean you’ve made it. It’s the first step in a long process. You don’t stop learning in football until the day you retire.

With Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Sheedy, David Unsworth and yourself all coaching at the club's Finch Farm training ground, there is a real core of Blues legends currently back working at Everton. Do you think this benefits the club's young players?

I think it can only be beneficial to see the likes of Sheedy (Under 18s manager), Ferguson (first-team coach), Unsworth (Under 21s assistant) and myself working at the club. We’ve been there, done it, lived the dream and it goes a long way.

We’re not just there on a name alone, though. We have to be good coaches and are there because we’re doing something right.

You spoke to Everton chairman Bill Kenwright in the summer about the vacant manager’s job before Roberto Martinez was appointed as the club’s new boss...

Yeah, I spoke to the chairman and we had an informal chat. It’s an ambition of mine and something I want to do in the future and I will be a manager one day.

Everton have enjoyed a brilliant season under Martinez despite some fans being worried when the Spaniard first arrived at Goodison Park. Did you expect the club to perform so well this season?

I think you can be a bit wary when a new manager comes in and have to expect a bit of a transitional period. We could have perhaps looked and thought: ‘We’ll take eighth place, aim for a top ten finish,’ but we’re fifth and the manager has done very well.

Impressive: Roberto Martinez has enjoyed an excellent campaign during his first season as Everton manager

Ambition: Stubbs insists he will go into club management one day having been interviewed for the Everton job

Evertonians have often been heard singing ‘The School of Science, is on its way back’ this season, harking back to the positive brand of football played by past Everton sides. Do you try to get the youngsters playing 'the Everton way', too?

We always want the lads to play football. We’ve never been direct and instead try to play. That philosophy has always been part of the club but I think Martinez has reinforced it. The players are playing in a positive environment and we try to educate them. 

At Everton, the ‘School of Science’ was always at the forefront during the 60s, 70s and 80s and now it’s back. Hopefully we can maintain it in the 21st century.

With Martinez at the helm and the talented youngsters coming through, how far can Everton go?

It’s difficult to put a finger on it but we have to aim to get as high as we can. We’ve made good strides this season and have some fantastic players at the club.

Alan Stubbs was speaking at a Barclays Thank You Day event, where two amateur football teams were given the opportunity to play at Everton's Goodison Park by Barclays.
