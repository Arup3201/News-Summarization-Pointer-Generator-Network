Diagnosis: Jacquie Beltrao made the announcement on Twitter last night

Sky News presenter Jacquie Beltrao revealed last night on Twitter that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.

Mrs Beltrao, 48, who presents sports news on the Sunrise show from 6am to 9am during the week, told her 33,000 followers that she learned of her illness on Christmas Eve.

Fans and Sky News colleagues responded by sending hundreds of supportive messages, which the presenter suggested may have brought her to tears.

The journalist, a former Olympic athlete, described the week between her diagnosis and announcement as 'a wobbly time' and said it was the reason she had been absent from the social networking site.

Mrs Beltrao, an Irish-born mother of three posted: 'Been neglecting my twitter had a bit of a
 wobbly time of it - diagnosed with Breast Cancer on Xmas Eve - all 
positive thoughts welcome !!'

Messages of support flooded in, from fans as well as fellow Sky journalists including Sunrise presenter Eamonn Holmes and news anchor Kay Burley.

Mrs Beltrao later thanked the well-wishers for their words and said they 'made me feel all emotional - not good when you're about to do eyeliner!'.

Later in the evening she thanked well-wishers for their messages of support, and posted photos of her New Year's Eve celebrations, assuring her followers that 'All will be good'.
