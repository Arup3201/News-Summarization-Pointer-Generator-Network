The family of a Minnesota couple missing in the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster have said they accept the decision to end the search.

In a blog posting, the children of Jerry and Barbara Heil of White Bear Lake said they are 'certainly disheartened to hear the news' but understand.

Italian emergency officials decided to end the search due to the danger posed to rescue workers.

The Heil family said in a statement: 
'We cannot express enough our sincere gratitude to all those involved in
the search and rescue effort. Time and time again, the rescuers faced 
many perils in the hopes of reuniting the missing with their families.

'We
will be forever grateful for all those who worked so hard for people 
they did not even know, yet understood how important their job was for 
those that remained waiting for news.

'As
we struggle to come to grips with this tragedy, we find comfort knowing
Mom and Dad are now in a better place free from any worries.'

The Heils are the only Americans missing following the January 13 disaster.

Some 4,200 passengers and crew were on board the Costa Concordia when it capsized.

Seventeen
bodies have been recovered, of which one has not yet been identified. 
Sixteen people remain listed as missing but are presumed dead. The last 
time anyone was found alive was January 15.

The Heils are active members of the Church of St Pius X in White Bear Lake, a St Paul suburb.

Church members describe the Heils as quiet, kind people deeply involved in their congregation.

Jerry Heil, 69, who retired from a job
at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, would teach religious 
education classes, and Barbara Heil, 70, would bring baked goods to 
class members.

Diane 
Vorwald, 48, who uses a wheelchair, said Jerry Heil would come to her 
home weekly to administer communion. In the summer, he would bring her 
fresh pies, she recalled.

Ms Vorwald said: 'He's done a lot for me. It's a loss to me.'

The Heil family is now making plans for a memorial service within the coming weeks.

The frightful images of the sinking Costa Concordia have scared off some cruise passengers, at least 
temporarily, during the industry's peak booking season.

Travel agents - who book more than 
two-thirds of cruise passengers worldwide - have been nervously watching
bookings ever since the Costa Concordia, which is owned by Carnival, ran aground on January 13.

On Monday, they got a new reason to be nervous - bookings fell 
significantly for Miami-based Carnival following the Costa 
accident.

Attention is now focused on Royal Caribbean Cruises, 
which reports earnings on Thursday. An increase there could show that 
passengers are fleeing Carnival over safety fears. A decrease could 
indicate an overall distrust of all cruise lines.

Nearly 11million Americans took a cruise last year, generating an 
estimated $14.5billion in revenue for the industry, according to 
PhoCusWright, a travel research firm.

Like the rest of the travel 
industry, cruise lines are still recovering from the Great Recession.

Several new mega-ships started sailing just as passengers struggling 
with their finances decided to stay home. But 2012 was supposed to be a 
year of moderate growth.

Carnival won't say exactly how much bookings have dropped, but it 
disclosed on Monday that in the 12 days following the Concordia capsizing 
there was a per cent decline 'in the mid-teens compared to the prior 
year'.

Reservations hit a low on January 16, the company said in its annual
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Carnival operates 101 ships under several brands including Costa, 
Carnival, Cunard, Holland America, Princess and Seabourn.

It said 
reservations with the Costa line are 'down significantly' but difficult 
to interpret because many Costa customers were rebooked on other ships 
because of the loss of the Concordia ship.

'Despite these recent trends, we believe the incident will not have a 
significant long-term impact on our business,' the company said.

Carnival's statement is the first evidence that passengers are hesitant 
to embark on cruises after seeing the awful images of the Concordia 
shipwrecked off the Italian coast.
