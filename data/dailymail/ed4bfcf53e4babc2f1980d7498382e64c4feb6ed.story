Marijuana lovers in Oregon had a cause for celebration last Tuesday, as election night saw the drug's legalization with the passing  of Measure 91.

One woman was so happy, that she licked a reporter covering a pro-pot party in Portland. 

KOIN news journalist Tim Becker was reporting live from a party at Holocene nightclub in southeast Portland when a young blonde woman appeared behind him and licked his ear.

The hilarious clip has now gone viral online, and MailOnline has identified the bold reveler as an employee at a local dispensary.

Cannabis celebrations: KOIN news journalist Tim Becker was reporting outside a pro-pot party last week, when a woman appeared behind him and licked his ear 

Broadcast interrupted: Becker was reporting about the celebrations after Oregon passed a measure, legalizing marijuana in the state 

Challenge accepted! The woman, who asked MailOnline not to be identified, said she licked the reporter's ear on the dare from a friend

The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, says she was standing outside the event space with friends when the reporter started talking to the camera.

One of her friends dared her to go up and lick his face, and at first she refused. 

But the woman agreed after her friend 'double-dog dared her' and the rest is internet history. 

While the reporter seemed to think the joke was funny, she says his cameraman didn't see the humor and called her immature.  

The passing of Measure 91 legalizes marijuana in the state of Oregon, but the new law will not be effective until next July. Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize the drug, and Alaska passed a similar  measure for legalization last week.

Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana possession in 1973.
