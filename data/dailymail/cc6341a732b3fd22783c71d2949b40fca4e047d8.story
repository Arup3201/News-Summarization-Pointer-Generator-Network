A British man threatened to kill an air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol, a court heard.

The alleged incident took place on June 2 on an Emirates service from London to Dubai.

A Dubai court was told that the threat was made by the 40-year-old, named only as A M, amid several outbursts of verbal abuse directed at cabin staff and unseemly behaviour that included throwing food at other passengers.

Trial: A British man threatened to kill an Emirates air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol, a court heard

The defendant began drinking shortly before take off, the trial heard, and 20 minutes into the journey, The National reported.

It reported the Indian flight attendant, 30, known only as B S, as saying: 'He was eating and throwing away food on the floor, then eating off the floor.

'I went to him and asked him to return to his seat and have his meal there. I then brought a garbage bag and started picking up the food he threw away.

'He also threw food on passengers around him and jumped from his seat to the aisle and started making a mess. Some passengers asked to change seats from near him.'

B S also alleges that A M pulled on her shirt so hard that she felt pain, then told her that she was a 'sex slave'.

The court then heard that he threatened to slap her, kill her and chop her up.

Another attendant E M, 26, from Egypt, told the trial: 'I was ordered to attend to the problem and, when I did, I saw him jumping on his seat and pulling B S from her shirt, then insulting her with very bad words.'

A M allegedly then set the plane's fire alarms off by smoking a cigarette in the toilet, which caused considerable worry among passengers.

When he was told that he would be met by police once the plane had landed he responded with verbal aggression then fell asleep, the trial heard.

He denies all charges and the trial has been adjourned until September 24.
