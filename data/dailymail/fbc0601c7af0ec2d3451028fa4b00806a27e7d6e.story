Amelie Mauresmo could be found the other night sitting on the floor outside the men’s locker room waiting for her player to emerge after his Australian Open fourth-round win.

Of all the uncertainties and backstage undercurrents surrounding Andy Murray’s semi-final against Tomas Berdych on Thursday morning, one thing is for sure: his coach will not gain access to the inner sanctum to offer advice.

While Dani Vallverdu’s presence in Berdych’s box gives this encounter a fascinating dynamic, it should not be overlooked how important the match is for Mauresmo — still in some senses the outsider.

A win for Murray and a return to a Grand Slam final will silence many doubters, who question whether he made the right decision to hire her as Ivan Lendl’s long-term replacement.

Defeat, though, will leave the Mauresmo appointment open to debate, and it will be all the more galling to have had the long-term ally he split with sitting in the opposition box.

Murray is aware of all this and has become protective of his coach, going out of his way to sing her praises after a run when he has looked much more his old self.

He is also persisting — to the puzzlement of Vallverdu — with his line that everyone in his slimmed-down team is now working together.

‘When everyone is pulling in the same direction, then things are going to improve,’ he said.

‘I feel like I made some big improvements to my game and physically in the off-season, and I think that has showed so far in this event.

‘I enjoy working with Amelie. She’s fantastic. She gets on very well with my team, too. She has a good personality to coach and a lot of experience, so I’m happy with the way it’s working. I’ve got some things to look forward to later in the year with Kim (his fiancee), and when you’re content with things and happy in the people you’re surrounding yourself with, that’s a positive.’

Murray is set to come up against his long-term friend Dani Vallverdu, who now coaches Berdych

He felt the need for change late last season, especially after the drubbing he took at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the hands of Roger Federer.

‘Clearly the way things ended at the O2 wasn’t the best way to end it. Maybe there were some reasons for that. I think things right now are much smoother and calmer, and everyone’s a lot less stressed than was the case at the end of last year.’ It must be said that his excellent results, bar Federer, in the post-US Open period do not talk of a team held back by disharmony.

There is the sense that Murray is using his loyalty to his coach, and the conflict-by-proxy with his old friend Vallverdu, as motivational fodder.

While Mauresmo was keeping her counsel, Vallverdu talked publicly on Wednesday in a way that he was never allowed to do when working with the 27-year-old Scot. The Venezuelan is now his own man, but still knows better than to wind up Murray.

 The Scot was in fine form to defeat Australian hope Nick Kyrgios in straight sets in the quarter-finals

‘Last year he might not have been as fit,’ said Vallverdu. ‘He went through back surgery. It’s normal that it takes time to get back to where you were before.

‘I don’t see it as any different to where he was two or three years ago. I think he’s at the same level when he was winning Slams and I’m happy for him.’ He does not recognise the issue Murray raised about not pulling together, and added: ‘To be honest, I don’t know what he means, at least from my side.’

What he and Murray do agree on is that Vallverdu’s inside knowledge is not going to be the defining factor in this semi-final.

‘I don’t think so,’ said Vallverdu. ‘They know each other’s games very well. I don’t think I am the advantage. Andy and Tomas are the ones playing against each other. If at the start of the tournament you’d asked Tomas or Andy if they’d like to be in this situation, they would have said yes.’

The other semi-final sees a re-match of last year’s classic quarter-final between Stan Wawrinka and world No 1 Novak Djokovic. On that occasion Wawrinka won 9-7 in the fifth and went on to claim the title.
