The court heard Corrupt detective Daniel Withnell was 'living in a realm of fantasy'

A corrupt detective who tried to frame an innocent man, water down criminal charges against a drugs suspect and even falsely claim a hit man was out to kill him has been jailed for four years.

Det Con Daniel Withnell, 30, was arrested after he offered to plant a shotgun and drugs on the ex-partner of a high class escort in exchange for £19,000.

He turned to corruption after his life 'spiralled out of control' due to a failed business and living well beyond his means. He made friends with gangland villains in the hope they could help him pay off his massive debts.

During one incident Withnell illegally accessed a police database to alter the charge sheet of a suspected drugs baron who had been arrested on suspicion of a £495,000 drugs and money laundering racket.

Posing as a prosecution lawyer the crooked constable - based at Salford, Greater Manchester - sent ‘advice’ suggesting the investigation against his friend should be shelved or made subject of lesser allegations.

His scam unravelled after he met with 48-year-old escort Claire Smethurst who wanted to set up her ex-lover Leroy Thomas after a stormy break-up.

Withnell suggested planting drugs and a shotgun in Mr Thomas’ car after Smethurst text him saying ‘the f****er needs sorting out’.

She gave him £19,000 in cash but got cold feet the following day and called the plan off - before reporting Withnell to police during a meeting at a Manchester hotel.

He was arrested and suspended from Greater Manchester Police on October 22 last year but then sent an anonymous text to another officer posing as an informer and warning a hitman was out to kill Withnell.

Smethurst received a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for her part in the plot after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice

Believing the text was a real threat to his life - police deployed 20 officers, three sergeants and two armed response unit vehicles to find the fictional gunman.

But after further investigations it emerged Withnell had sent the texts himself as part of a plan to an 'engineering a sense of duress for the ongoing investigations.'

Withnell, from Bolton, whose father was also a police officer pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice.

The court heard he was 'living in a realm of fantasy' when he intimated he could use his position and contacts within the police force to get his acquaintance off the drugs supply charge. He has since quit the force.

Passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell told his offences represented a 'gross breach of trust.'

The judge told Withnell: 'At the time you had 12 years of service and some of that time was as a detective and I am sure for most of that time you would have been an effective police officer who gave reason for your family to be proud of you - especially your father.

Claire Smethurst paid Withenll to frame her ex-boyfriend on a trumped up charge. She gave him £19,000 in cash but got cold feet the following day and called the plan off - before reporting him to police

'Your personal life was out of control. You made extremely unwise relationships for a police officer.

'The fact you were crippled by debt meant that when you saw the opportunity of obtaining a large sum of money you did.

'The scandalous nature of that case is perhaps misleading as I am satisfied that there really never was any intention of planting the shotgun and you didn’t have any corrupt colleagues and anything you said to her was little more than sales patter from nothing more than a corrupt sales person.

'This is a man who has squandered a successful future'Judge Michael Henshell on Withnell

'You are entirely the author of your own fortune. Whatever your personal circumstances were, the means you used to relieve yourself of the burden was entirely wrong and criminal.'

In mitigation, defence lawyer Mr Alex Leach said: 'He was crippled by debt as a result of repeated financial failure in business.

'It prevented him from being able to provide fully to the children of which he is a father.

'His father described his son as becoming vacant, withdrawn and illogical. It’s obvious the defendant was much changed.

'By the time he came to offer to commit the offence with Claire Smethurst he was overwhelmed by circumstance.

'It’s to his credit he never acted on any of the foolish ideas proposed. It was all fantasy.

Withnell, from Bolton, whose father was also a police officer pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice

'He had 12 years of service and in his earlier career he did not begin his service motivated by greed or dishonesty rather than altruism and serving the public where he worked hard and well.

'This is a man who has squandered a successful future and who will live with the consequences long after custody has expired.'

After the case Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley of Greater Manchester said: 'The conduct of former DC Daniel Withnell fell well short of what is expected of a police officer.

'Police officers, staff and the communities of Greater Manchester would be appalled by his actions, which detract from the hard work that our officers and staff do on a daily basis.

'GMP expects the very highest standards of all its officers and staff. They should be honest and act with integrity and should not compromise or abuse their position.

Smethurst received a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for her part in the plot after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice last month.

Smethurst, of Westhoughton, Bolton, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment in prison suspended for two years after she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice at an earlier hearing.
