Nicholas Overton, 35, willl be questionned over a string of robberies after being given day release from prison

An escaped convict will be questioned over a string of robberies after being given day release from prison - less than half way into his eighteen year stretch.

Nicholas Overton, 35, who was locked away over a string of armed robberies in 2006, escaped a month ago.

He had been released for the day from HMP Thorn Cross in Warrington, Cheshire - only to fail to return, sparking a nationwide manhunt.

Today police recaptured fugitive Overton, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire in a dawn swoop on a house in Crewe following a 28 day manhunt.

He will now be quizzed over a knifepoint robbery at a Coop store in Haslington, near Crewe carried out just days after he was reported missing by prison bosses.

Officers are also looking into the possibility the raid was linked to other robberies at a nearby off licence and others shops in the Macclesfield area.

A 38-year-old woman was arrested on harbouring an escaped prisoner. Enquiries are continuing.

A row has broken out over Overton's escape which occurred on August 22.

A friend of a shopworker who was held up at gunpoint by Overton during his last crime spree said: 'It's disgraceful - what was he doing out of prison.'

Overton had received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court in 2006 for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out upon shops across five counties over a two-month period.

It was not known why Overton had been granted day release.

Cheshire Police said the knifepoint robbery occurred at 8.44pm on September 12 at the Co-Op in Crewe Road.

A man entered the store and selected a pint of milk before approaching the counter and handing the cashier a £1 coin. As the shop assistant opened the till he produced a 6 inch knife and leaned over the counter to take cash from the till.

The shop assistant attempted to stop the man from taking the money, but the offender escaped with a quantity of cash. A blue green Audi A6 which has the registration plate V990 DBB was seen in the area at the time and Overton is being linked to the vehicle.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Release on temporary licence is used to prepare prisoners for their eventual release from custody.

'We fully support the police in their investigation and we are examining the circumstances of this case to identify any lessons that can be learned.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
