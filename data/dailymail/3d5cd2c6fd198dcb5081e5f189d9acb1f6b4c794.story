Former Chelsea star Salamon Kalou has revealed he was inspired to join his new club Hertha Berlin by seeing Germany win this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Kalou, 29, told newspaper Bild that the German league is now a major attraction for top players after Joachim Low's side became world champions.

The Ivorian international signed for Hertha on a free after leaving Lille at the end of last season, and hopes he can add to the side's attacking reputation.

'Everyone wants to play in the Bundesliga after the World Cup,' said Kalou. 'I'm no different. I spoke with plenty of my international team-mates about Germany and they only had good things to say. 

'Hertha play really great, attacking football and I love a challenge!'

Kalou is known in England primarily as a winger, but will be looking to secure a starting berth in the German capital. 

'Centre forward's my favourite position,' the Ivorian international told Bild. 'I played out wide for Chelsea, but that's because they had too many strikers. 

'At the end of the day, though, I just want to help the team. I haven't set myself any goals. The important thing is that the team's successful.'

Record: Kalou scored 30 league goals in just 67 games playing as a forward for Lille after leaving Chelsea
