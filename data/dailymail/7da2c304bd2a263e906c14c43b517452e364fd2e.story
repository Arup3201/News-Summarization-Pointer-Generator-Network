The woman shot in the stomach before Ismaaiyl Brinsley assassinated two NYPD officers has been released from hospital.

Shaneka Thompson, 29, was released from a Baltimore Hospital yesterday after spending just over a week recovering from a gunshot wound inflicted by Brinsley on December 20.

After shooting the Air Force reservist, Brinsley went on to murder Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in New York, in an apparent act of revenage over the police killings of two unarmed black men this summer.

Brinsley shot Ms Thompson, an Air Force reservist in the stomach and threatened to kill her if she called the police; he then travelled to New York and killed Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos

Ms Thompson's grandfather James Delly told the New York Post  she was 'feeling fine' and that her family was 'very happy'.

He said his granddaughter isn't fully recovered, but was 'progressing'. Ms Thompson is staying with her mother.  

Brinsley's rampage began with an early-morning visit to Ms Thompson's Baltimore apartment. After shooting her he threatened to kill her if she called police.spo

The 28-year-old then caught a bus to New York where he killed the two officers, before running into the subway where he took his own life. 

Ms Thompson's release, comes as tensions between the New York police and Mayor Bill de Blasio continue to sour.

De Blasio was booed during an officer swearing-in ceremony yesterday, and hundreds of officers turned their backs on him during Ramos' funeral on Saturday. 

Some officers have been highly critical of de Blasio for remarks about police relations with black Americans that they say incited the shooting.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was jeered yesterday when he addressed New York police officers during a swearing in ceremony at Madison Square Garden

Hundreds of officers also turned their backs on de Basio at Ramos' funeral on Saturday  

While de Blasio was speaking yesterday as 884 new police officers were sworn in at the city's Madison Square Garden, the crowd jeered.

De Blasio praised the city's police as 'the finest police department in the world,' and said the new officers had made a 'heroic choice' to join the force.

Despite the praise, de Blasio was given only tepid applause compared to Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who took the floor next.

When de Blasio said police would have to deal with problems they had not created, someone shouted: 'You have created them.'

When he took the podium, Bratton continued to mount his defense of the criticized mayor, citing his 'passion' for the police during 'very difficult times.'

Aides for de Blasio pointed out that this wasn't the first time the mayor has been booed at a ceremony. 

The funeral for the second officer killed by Brinsley is scheduled for this weekend. 

A prayer vigil will be held on Saturday for Liu, 32, and he will be buried the following day.
