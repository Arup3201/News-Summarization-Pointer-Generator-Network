They normally inhabit the deep waters far off our coast, but thanks to our warm weather huge barrel jellyfish, weighing up to 35kg, have been spotted just off the beaches of Cornwall.

Attracted by plentiful plankton the creatures have ventured closer to shore as they feed and reproduce in vast numbers, forming dense groups known as blooms.

Scuba diving photographer Charles Hood captured this creature with his 6’3' tall son Will, just off St Michael’s Mount, Penzance, Mr Hood was stunned to find a massive group of barrel jellyfish spread out over an area of eight square miles towards Lands End.

‘We usually get perhaps a dozen sightings a year,’ said Mr Hood. ‘But at the moment they are everywhere, itís like a super bloom with some of them a metre and a half in size.

‘There is a massive amount of plankton forming which they seem to be feeding on.’

The Marine Conservation Society said it had received reports of jellyfish being spotted across the south coast and west coast of England, as well as parts of Scotland because of the warmer weather.

Easily identified by their distinctive smooth bell and cauliflower-shaped mass of tentacles that house hundreds of tiny mouths, a digestive system and stinging cells, the jellyfish feed only on microscopic plankton but thankfully pose no threat to swimmers as their sting is not strong enough to harm humans.

Will, 16, said: ‘It was my first encounter swimming with them and although there’s nothing to fear from their sting I felt fine as I was in a drysuit. 

‘There was a tiny little fish living in the tentacles that appeared to be immune to the sting, They could swim relatively quickly for a jellyfish, perhaps about half a kilometre per hour.’

Both humans and jellyfish will be glad to know continuous sunshine could be on the way for the 
next 40 days – if British folklore is to be believed.

Many
 will welcome the fact the Met Office is forecasting bright sunshine and
 temperatures of 25C, as superstition states that if the sun shines on 
July 15, it will continue to do so for the next 40 days.

Temperatures were expected to reach 25C across many parts of the country yesterday before soaring to the late twenties on Thursday and Friday making Britain hotter than some European holiday destinations including Ibiza, Nice and Barcelona.

Temperatures could rise to a sweltering 30C in 
many parts of the country on Thursday and Friday, including in the south
 east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the UK over 
the next few days. Sun-seekers enjoyed the sunshine in Bournemouth 
today, including Talia Jade Rahl, one (left), and Charlotte Finch, six

Wednesday also looks promising, with the bulk of England and Wales likely to remain dry and sunny.

It
 will herald the start of another hot spell in Britain, where 
temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations
 such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice.

Temperatures
 will start to rise from Thursday, peaking on Friday when the 30C 
barrier could be reached for the first time this year, with the most 
likely location somewhere to the north-west of London.

Forecasters say there is is a 'very good chance' the hottest day of the year so far could be surpassed by Friday. The hottest day of 2014 so far was July 4, when 28.7C (83.7F) was detected in Norfolk and Essex.

However,
 the balmy conditions towards the end of the week – which could see the 
hottest day of the year so far surpassed – could bring ‘thundery’ rain.

Mr
 Williams said there was a chance heavy showers could develop in parts 
of the UK on Thursday before it clears later in the afternoon.

However,
 despite the blip, temperatures are expected to rise to a sweltering 30C
 in many parts of the country on Thursday and Friday, including in the 
south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the UK 
over the next few days.

Mr Williams said there was a very good chance the hottest day of the year so far could be surpassed by Friday.

The hottest day of 2014 so far was July 4, when 28.7C (83.7F) was detected in Norfolk and Essex.

However,
 despite the ‘hot and humid’ weather, forecasters have warned the 
conditions could be uncomfortable for some as it will feel muggy instead
 of fresh.

Met Office 
forecaster Helen Roberts said ‘thundery downpours’ could give brief 
respite from the hot and sticky weather on Friday and Saturday.

She said: ‘Most people won't enjoy these conditions. It can be difficult sleeping during the hot humid nights.

‘Although it probably is shorts and T-shirt weather, you will need a brolly at the same time.’

Many will be relieved it stayed dry  to coincide with the folklore of St Swithun's Day. While legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country will be in for 40 days of sun.

The conditions, which should 
ease when a band of fresher air sweeps in on Sunday, are not expected to
 trigger the Met Office's official threshold for a heatwave.

While
 the legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 
40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country 
will be in for 40 days of sunshine.

The British folklore dates back to c.800, when St Swithun was a Saxon bishop at Winchester Cathedral.

As he lay on his deathbed he asked to be buried outside where he would be trodden on and rained on.

His
 wishes were followed for nine years, then on July 15, 971, the monks of
 Winchester attempted to remove his remains to a shrine inside the 
cathedral.

This week's warm weather heralds the start of another hot spell in Britain, where temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice.

According to legend, the 
removal was accompanied by ferocious and violent rain storms which 
lasted 40 days and nights and were said to indicate the saint's 
displeasure at being moved.

The
 story soon became British folklore and ever since the weather patterns 
on July 15 have been closely followed by the superstitious.

The
 folklore’s rhyme reads: 'St Swithin’s day if thou dost rain, For 40 
days it will remain. St Swithin’s day if thou be fair, For 40 days 
’twill rain no more.'

However,
 the Met Office has routinely said there is no ‘scientific evidence’ 
supporting the folklore and said numerous studies have been carried out 
on past weather observations, with none proving the legend to be true.

It
 also said that since the start of records in 1861, there has been 
neither 40 dry or 40 wet days following the corresponding weather on St 
Swithun's Day.

While
 it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for 
the next 40, there is some element of truth to weather patterns 
continuing.

By this point in the summer, the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of August.

The jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere.

It
 tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and 
marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the 
south.

If it is 
sitting to the north of the UK, then warm air tends to invade from the 
south, usually associated with high pressure building in from the 
Azores, leading to fine and settled weather for the British Isles.

However,
 should the jet stream sit across the UK or to the south, then cooler 
air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across 
the country from the Atlantic, leading to unsettled weather.

So far, the jet stream is pointing directly towards the British Isles, indicating unsettled weather.
