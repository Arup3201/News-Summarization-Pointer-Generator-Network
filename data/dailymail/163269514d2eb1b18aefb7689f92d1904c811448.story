With a £4million mansion in picturesque Swedish countryside, a 60ft pool and an exotic dancer girlfriend roughly half his age, life is good for Sven-Goran Eriksson.

Posing for Sweden’s answer to Hello! magazine, the former England manager, 66, showed off his ‘dream house’ which he has just put on the market, giving a rare glimpse into his gilded lifestyle.

His flat-screen TV is so large it would make some of the footballers he once managed blush, while the pebble drive outside the 12-bedroom mansion has room for ten cars.

Romance: Sven-Goran Eriksson with former nightclub dancer girlfriend Yaniseth Bravo outside his £4million mansion in picturesque Swedish countryside

At the table: Eriksson at dinner with Yaniseth, her son Alcides, in the yellow top, and members of his family

Features: As well as the heated pool, the seven-acre estate boasts a gym, a private lake, a beach house with sauna, tennis courts and a garage big enough for four cars

Watching TV: He claims he was forced to put the mansion up for sale after losing £10million through the actions of a financial adviser who was declared bankrupt

As well as the heated pool, the 
seven-acre estate boasts a gym, a private lake, a beach house with 
sauna, tennis courts and a garage big enough for four cars.

Add
 to that the fact that the Swede now has his own Italian wine range – 
known simply as ‘Sven’ – and you may feel he has done well out of life.

And
 this is just his holiday home where he spends two weeks a year. In the 
words of the hotel porter who once delivered champagne to George Best 
and found the footballer entertaining a scantily clad Miss World on a 
bed covered in casino winnings: Where did it all go wrong?

In
 the Expressen Söndag magazine piece, Eriksson – who had high-profile 
affairs with Nancy Dell’Olio, Ulrika Jonsson and Football Association 
secretary Faria Alam, among others – is pictured with former nightclub 
dancer girlfriend Yaniseth Bravo, who wears a scarlet Lacoste tennis 
dress and diamond earrings.

He opens up about his love life and his girlfriend of five years, whom he met in Mexico when he was managing the national side.

'We don’t get to spend much time together, but it has worked out nicely up till now. I like her of course and she is not the type of person that is demanding, which is nice'

Miss Bravo, who has a nine-year-old son, Alcides, by her ex-husband, now lives in Panama while Eriksson manages Chinese club Guangzhou R&F for £2million a year.

The long-distance relationship works well, despite Eriksson being based in China, he says.

‘We don’t get to spend much time together, but it has worked out nicely up till now. I like her of course and she is not the type of person that is demanding, which is nice,’ he says.

He claims he was forced to put the mansion up for sale after losing £10million through the actions of a financial adviser who was declared bankrupt.
