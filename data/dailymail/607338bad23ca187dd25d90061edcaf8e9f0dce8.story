Adidas' 10-year deal with United begins at the start of the 2015/16 season, ending American sportswear rivals Nike's 13-year association with the club.

In April, Forbes magazine valued the Old Trafford outfit as the second most valuable team in the world at £1.77billion.

They were second to Real Madrid's £1.92billion value, but that has changed following United's deal with Adidas.

Despite missing out on Champions League qualification last season, Louis van Gaal's side commands the highest kit and sponsorship deals in the world - which includes their £53million-a-year deal with American car manufacturer Chevrolet.

Barcelona - Qatar Airways - £26million

Bayern Munich - Deutsche Telekom - £23million

Real Madrid - Emirates - £23million

Liverpool - Standard Chartered - £18million

Sunderland - Invest in Africa - £18million

Regardless of the club's debt, Wall 
Street predicts that the Manchester outfit will stay at the top of this 
chart for years to come with Adidas boldly predicting they will record 
£1.5billion worth of replica shirt sales over the term of their 
contract.

In addition Forbes reports that over in Spain La Liga teams are looking to distribute their next television deal collectively rather than individually, which would dent Real and eternal rivals Barcelona's financially power.

At present the Spanish duo generate around £106 million each in television revenue in comparison to current champions Atletico Madrid who earn £36million.

Fair share? Atletico Madrid earn £36million in La Liga television rights compared to Real's £106million
