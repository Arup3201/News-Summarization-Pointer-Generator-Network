In the face of criticism from the President of the Human Rights Commission and even members of his own party,Tony Abbott believes he should receive a ‘ big tick of approval’ for his actions around people smuggling and ‘stopping the boats’.

Mr Abbott, who’s approval rating as risen to a four month high, backed himself and the actions of the former Immigrations Minister, Scott Morrison, saying the report released by the commission investigating the conditions of children held in detentions is a ‘political-stitch up’. 

"This government has lost confidence in the president of the Human Rights Commission."

However, not all Liberals are singing the same tune with the Communications Minister, Malcom Turnbull speaking out on behalf of Ms Triggs, highlighting her stellar reputation in the legal community as a ‘very distinguished legal academic’.

Amidst all the controversy he says it’s important to focus on the issue at hand which is the 211 children still detained in Australia and the 199 children on Naru.

‘The issue is not Gillian Triggs, or personalities, or arguments about the Human Rights Commission. The issue is the children,’ he said.

The 10-month-long inquiry found prolonged immigration detention causes significant mental and physical illness. 

Between January 2013 and March 2014 records show there have been of hundreds of cases of assault, 128 cases of self harm and a sickening 33 reports of sexual assault . 

The report has labelled the Australian governemt’s practices as a clear violation of international human rights law, calling for a full royal commission into the detention of children.

The Liberal government denies their criticisms of Ms Triggs are an attempt to discredit the report. 

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton hit back saying the report is ‘historically’ representative of previous Labor government’s policies which saw peak numbers of children in immigrations detention centres at nearly 2000 in mid 2013, a number Mr Abbott claims is now under 200.

His comments come as the Australian Federal Police are set to investigate claims that the government offered Ms Triggs an incentive to resign from her role as the nation’s human right executive.

Labor wrote to the AFP on Wednesday initiating the investigation into whether the offer of a senior legal role for Ms Triggs constitutes a bribe.

Mr Abbott insists Prof Triggs was not asked to resign and no inducement was offered.
