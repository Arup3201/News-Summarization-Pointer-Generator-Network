If there's one British designer who knows how to do wearable fashion, it's Jasper Conran.

Season after season he serves up super feminine designs that women actually want to wear and garments that they'll look and feel good in.

Talking FEMAIL through his AW15 collection backstage ahead of the show on a blustery Saturday morning, he made his mission clear.

'When I design for women, I want them to walk into a room and look good,' he said.

Jasper Conran unveiled a wearable collection of cashmere dresses and hair-on-calf A-line skirts inspired by Japanese paintings at London Fashion Week today

'I'm thinking about their lives and I ponder: "does this actually work? Is it a real thing? When they walk into a room, are they going to look ridiculous or great?".'

Judging by his collection of fitted cashmere dresses, hair-on-calf  A-line skirts and the sexiest silks, Jasper has hit the nail on the head.

Shapewise, Jasper aimed to make his collection easy and loose and not overly tight for AW15

Taking inspiration from 19th century ukiyo-e prints from the Japanese designer Kunisada, Jasper's dreamy silk and cashmere designs were emblazoned with graphic woodblock patterns.

Broken stripes and chevrons in viridian green, rich chocolates and berry hues were broken up with bursts of brighter colours.

Comfort was key, as always, and pleated silk skirts, chunky hand knit tunics and cosy chocolate cashmere reigned supreme. 

'Shapewise, it's easy and loose and not overly tight this season; it's voluminous,' he said. 

'The collection is so wearable,' concluded Jasper. 'These are cashmere knits you can live in. You don't need a house anymore when you've got these! '.

His audience, including Laura Whitmore and Yasmin Le Bon, will no doubt be climbing over each other to cocoon themselves in his cashmere come Autumn.
