A panel of international handicappers has made the race to be Europe’s top horse for the 2014 Flat season a three-way tie between Aidan O’Brien’s Derby winner Australia, John Gosden’s electric miler Kingman and Kevin Ryan-trained The Grey Gatsby, winner of the French Derby and Irish Champion Stakes.

All three horses were each given a handicap rating of 127 after enjoying stellar seasons.

But the honour of being rated the Longines World’s Best racehorse for the year has been handed to Japanese star Just A Way (130).

The son of sire Heart’s Cry was beaten five lengths by Treve in the Prix De L’ Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, his only run in Europe.

But more store was put in his visually impressive six and a half length win in the Group One Dubai Duty Free in March. His other wins in 2014 included the Grade One Yasuda Kinen at Toyko.

It is the first time a Japanese horse has been rated the world’s best.

Just A Way finished second to Epiphaneia in the 2014 Japan Cup and that rival, with a rating of 129 was rated the second best in the world.

Europe did provided five of the top 10 rated performers with dual Arc de Triomphe victor Treve on 126 and emphatic German Derby hero Sea The Moon on 125.

Taghrooda, a stablemate of Kingman's, was top-rated three-year-old filly with a mark of 123 after winning the Oaks and King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes.

The Fugue, also from the Gosden yard, earned a rating of 124 thanks to achieving Group One glory for the third successive year with victory in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot.

Seasoned French-trained stars Cirrus Des Aigles and Flintshire each acquired a rating of 123 to end the year as the joint top-rated European older male horses alongside the O'Brien-trained Magician, who raced in four countries during a busy year.

Edward Lynam's Slade Power (119) ended 2014 as the highest-rated European-trained sprinter, by winning the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and Darley July Cup.

In so doing, he was rated just ahead of his stable companion Sole Power, winner of the King's Stand stakes and Nunthorpe Stakes, and the Betfred Sprint Cup scorer G Force. Both were put on 118.
