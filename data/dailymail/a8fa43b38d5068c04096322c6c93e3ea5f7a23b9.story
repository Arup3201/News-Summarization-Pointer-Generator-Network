Women who engage in 'fat talk' - critical remarks in relation to eating, exercise or their own bodies - are less popular with other women, according to the latest study.

Meanwhile, women who are overweight but make positive statements about their bodies are much more likeable.

Many people believe engaging in such self-deprecating dialogue helps initiate and strengthen social bonds with other 
women - but research from the Body Image and Eating Disorder Lab at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, America, proves this may not be the case.

Women who engage in self-disparaging conversation about food, exercise and bodies are less liked by their peers

Alexandra Corning, research associate professor of psychology and director of the lab, asked women aged between 18 to 25 to study other women looking at photographs of themselves.

The
women looking at the photos who made 'fat talk' about themselves, 
whether they were overweight or not, were rated significantly less 
likeable by the women studying them.

Whereas, the women who were overweight but made positive statements about their bodies were rated as more likeable.

Women who are self-deprecating about their bodies are less popular among peers than those who are happy about their size, even if they are overweight

Corning, who presented the study at the Midwestern Psychological Association annual conference, said: 'Though it has become a regular part of everyday conversation, "fat talk" is far from innocuous.

'It
is strongly associated with, and can even cause, body dissatisfaction, 
which is a known risk factor for the development of eating disorders.'

Many
people believe that engaging in 'fat talk' helps endear themselves to others and 
strengthens friendships.

Corning added: 'These findings are important because they raise awareness about how women actually are being perceived when they engage in this self-abasing kind of talk.

'This knowledge can be used to help national efforts to reduce "fat talking" on college campuses.'
