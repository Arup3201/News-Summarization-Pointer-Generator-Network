One hundred and 10 years to the day since the club was formed at a meeting in the Rising Sun pub, Chelsea's players were out in the watery spring sunshine preparing for their Champions League clash with PSG.

All of Jose Mourinho's squad were present at their training ground in Cobham in Surrey, apart from John Obi Mikel, who trained alone with a physio as he continues to recover from minor knee surgery.

Mourinho was first out with assistant Rui Faria followed by the players in vibrant yellow training kit, all looking happy and positive ahead of tomorrow's clash at Stamford Bridge as they launched into their stretching exercises.

The tie is poised at 1-1 after the first leg in Paris, but Chelsea No 1 Thibaut Courtois insists he holds no fear in facing Swedish forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Speaking to RMC, the Belgium international said: 'No, I'm not afraid. I played against him three weeks ago, and I played well. I hope to stop him again on Wednesday. I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.'

'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait.

'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0. We have to play to our strengths by trying to score goals and win the game.'
