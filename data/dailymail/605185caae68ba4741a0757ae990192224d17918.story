Security services are reportedly keeping tabs on 12 friends of terror suspect Numan Haider, the teen who was shot dead by police after allegedly stabbing two police officers.

The 18-year-old from Melbourne was killed with a single shot to the head by a Victorian police officer on September 23 near the Endeavour Hills Police Station.

Haider had been under investigation by authorities for at least three months before his death. Now ASIO are monitoring his associates, a close friend of the teen has told the Herald Sun.

'We're being terrorised by ASIO,' they claimed. The friend, who was not named, added: ‘We are not a threat. We’re normal people.’

Numan Haider was allegedly shot dead by police after stabbing two police officers in Melbourne

Daily Mail Australia have contacted ASIO for comment. 

In the months leading up to his death, police were reportedly concerned about some of Haider's recent activities and rhetoric. 

They had raided the family home hours before the stabbing incident, Victorian police commissioner Ken Lay told ABC 774 radio.

Officers then arranged to meet Haider near Endeavour Hills Police Station in the city's south-eastern suburbs, where the incident occurred.

Mr Lay said there was evidence suggesting Numan Haider had discussions with other people prior to the stabbing.

'There's some information that he was certainly talking to other people around the time,' Mr Lay said. 'It's certainly something we're pushing.'

'Having said that, there were some really worrying pieces about this young man's behaviour that we are working through.’

A friend of Haider's has claimed that ASIO are now 'terrorising' around 12 of his associates 

Mr Lay denied claims that Haider was conducting a beheading after it was reported he had been carrying two knives and an Islamic State flag recently.

'There is nothing, absolutely nothing to suggest that was the intention,' he said.

Police allege Haider greeted the Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on the night of his death.

Seconds later, he repeatedly stabbed both officers.

A coronial inquiry began on 3 October, where it was revealed police officers had arranged to talk to Haider about his recently cancelled Australian passport on the day that he died. 

Counsel assisting the coroner, Jessica Wilby, said Haider stabbed a Victoria Police officer in the arm and an Australian Federal Police officer in the chest and face.

He was still holding the knife in his hand when he was shot dead, Wilby said.  

Haider was killed with a single shot to head by a childhood learning centre

Haider reportedly previously came into contact with police when he was with a group of men outside the Dandenong Hub - a shopping arcade in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs.

They were questioned by as many as 15 police officers.

George Sarkatzis, who owns Alabenlo music store at the arcade, said he had spoken to the teenager following the incident.

He said about five to eight police officers surrounded the group on a Thursday afternoon.

'He wasn't like angry, he was just upset,' Mr Sarkatzis told Daily Mail Australia. 'He said: 'I don't have the freedom to express my beliefs''.

'My main concern was if you want to preach a belief in a peaceful place, don't wear army pants.'

But this is not the first time Mr Sarkatzis had seen a group gather outside the Dandenong Hub.

'I've seen (people) now and again. They do come here and canvass their beliefs but I'm not sure if they were the same beliefs that he had.'
