Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has today denied allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series.

In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

The allegations, reported in the Mirror, come just weeks after Clarkson was accused of racism over referring to a 'slope' on a bridge in an episode filmed in Thailand.

But Mr Clarkson this morning took to Twitter to deny the allegations, telling his 3.29m followers: 'I did not use the n word. Never use it. The Mirror has gone way too far this time.'

According
 to the Mirror, Clarkson uttered the n-word during filming of the third 
episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota 
GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount.

Telling
 viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the 
two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting 
rhyme.

David Cameron today distanced himself from Jeremy Clarkson, a fellow member of the exclusive 'Clipping Norton set'.

The two men are often seen together at events in Oxfordshire.

But today Downing Street sought to prevent being dragged into the row over the n-word.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'Usage of that word would be quite wrong. If there are reports and allegations I am sure that is something the BBC would want to look at.'

Asked if the PM would use the n-word, he added: 'Certainly not.'

Audio forensic 
experts studied the clip and confirmed to the newspaper that, in their view, Clarkson 
had used the word, which is deemed highly offensive.

In the version of the show which aired in February 2013 he was heard to say 'teacher'.

Legal
 experts have said that if the presenter used the word, he could have breached equality 
legislation, depending on the context in which the word was used and 
whether a crew member had been offended by what was said.

'If it had been brought to the attention 
of the police they would have considered whether an offence had taken 
place and whether it was in the public interest to prosecute,' said 
solicitor Lucy Scott Moncrief.

'All
 employers and programme makers have policies on discrimination and I 
would have thought that this kind of language would have been a breach 
of those and could have led to disciplinary action.'

A BBC spokesman said the corporation wanted to establish the facts before commenting. MailOnline has also contacted Mr Clarkson's agent but there has not yet been a response. 

Clarkson was also accused of racism after he tweeted a picture of his black 
West Highland terrier and revealed he had named it after Ivory Coast 
footballer Didier Drogba.

Last week the 
executive producer of Top Gear admitted Clarkson 
had called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction 
of a bridge in Thailand during an episode.

There was outcry when he used the word, a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, during the show's two-part Burma special, screened in March this year.

Producer Andy Wilman said he regrets the 
'light-hearted' wordplay and realises 'that it can be considered 
offensive to some here and overseas'.

Mr Wilman made the 
statement after Indian-born actress Somi Guha instructed lawyers to make
 a formal complaint about the use of the word, which she described as 
'casual racism'.

'When we used the word ‘slope’ in the 
recent Top Gear Burma Special it was a light-hearted word play joke 
referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man
 who was crossing it,' he said.

Last night, Clarkson put out a contrite statement that he 'loathed' the N-word and would never, ever, use it

This is not the first time that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments.

In March, Indian-born actress Somi Guha, 36, threatened to sue the BBC for up to £1million after Mr Clarkson allegedly used the word 'slope' - a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - in the Top Gear Burma special.

In
 the series finale, the three hosts - Richard Hammond, James May and 
Jeremy Clarkson - are tasked with building a bridge over the River Kwai 
in Thailand.

After 
completion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope 
on it', as a man walked towards him on a makeshift bridge.

A BBC spokeswoman for Top Gear said the Corporation had no comment on Miss Guha's action.

On
 April 21, Jeremy Clarkson was accused of racism yesterday for naming 
his black West Highland terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea 
star Didier Drogba, who is from the Ivory Coast.

Clarkson,
 who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name
 our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’

Clarkson later used his Twitter account 
to respond to the allegation, and said: 'I'm not a racist. I am 
currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near Wales.'

In December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in 
front of their families'.

Weeks later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'.

In his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson 
wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the 
‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains.

He went on: 'We were not aware at the time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word 'slope' is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be widely recognised in the UK, we appreciate that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas, for example in Australia and the USA.

'If we had known that at the time we would not have broadcast the word in this context and regret any offence caused.'

In the show, presenters Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May build a makeshift bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand.

As the challenge came to a conclusion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment – but there’s a slope on it.'

Richard Hammond replies: 'You’re right, it’s definitely higher on that side.'

At the same time, an Asian man is seen walking across the bridge towards the two presenters.

Ms Guha, 36, later claimed that broadcasting Clarkson's comment amounted to unlawful discrimination by a public body.  

Her lawyers, Equal Justice, claimed her 
action could cost the BBC £1 million in punitive damages under equality 
laws unless it apologised and took the hit motoring show off the air.

They said 
she was one of a group of people who were offended by the term - and so 
sought legal advice from the firm, who previously worked on racism 
allegations surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother.

Clarkson
 later used his Twitter account to respond to the allegation, and said: 
'I'm not a racist. I am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives 
quite near Wales.'

Today James May, who features on Top Gear with Mr Clarkson, tweeted his support for his colleague.

After news of the controversy broke, Mr May - also known as Captain Slow - wrote: 'Jeremy Clarkson is not a racist. He is a monumental bellend and many other things, but not a racist. I wouldn't work with one.'

He then used the hashtag #ThatIsAll to make his point.

Richard Hammond, who also works on the show with Mr Clarkson, echoed Mr May's statement.

On Twitter earlier today, he wrote: 'I 2nd May's comments re Clarkson. I can list a million things wrong with him, but he is absolutely not racist. An idiot, yes.'

Earlier this month, Mr Clarkson was also criticised after tweeting the picture of the dog, named Didier Dogba.

He asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’

Twitter
 user Gbolade Oguntomole said: ‘It’s racist man! Casual racism! You 
should be ashamed of yourself. I like you Jeremy Clarkson but this is 
wrong!’

Others,
 however, defended the television host, saying that the name was funny 
and labelling Clarkson a racist was an over-reaction.
