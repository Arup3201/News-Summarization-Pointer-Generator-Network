Eric Trump's bride-to-be Lara Yunaska doesn't need to buy a Halloween costume this year, thanks to her scary looking wrist injury.

The 31-year-old CBS producer posted a picture today of the painful stitches in her arm, the result of the horse riding accident she got into last week.

'Happy Halloween. I have a built-in costume this year!  #FrankensteinArm,' she captioned the photo taken at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where she was presumably having her injury checked out by doctors.

The bride-to-be broke both her wrists in a riding accident last Thursday, just two weeks before her November 8 wedding to the son of billionaire businessman Donald Trump.

Since then, she has posted a handful of understandably morose photos of her bandaged wrists to Instagram, captioning one: 'Wedding countdown: 2 weeks and 2 casts to go! #HopeImAFastHealer.'

This is an optimistic outlook, since a broken wrist typically takes between six and eight weeks to heal; so with her wedding going ahead as planned, she'll be wearing more white than she bargained for. 

Lara first announced the injury last Thursday with a selfie from her bed, captioned: 'There's no place like home. Also, a #selfie w two broken wrists is quite a task. #imexhausted.'

Passion: Despite her painful fall, Lara has stated that it won't stop her from getting back on a horse. 'There are inherent risks that we all take in life. When you truly love something, it's worth it,' she wrote

But despite her painful fall, Lara has stated that it won't stop her from getting back on a horse. 'There are inherent risks that we all take in life. When you truly love something, it's worth it,' she wrote.

'I wouldn't take back one day of riding - stuff happens. I will ride again and it will be better than ever. Most importantly, I still get to marry the love of my life on Nov 8th.'

Lara and Eric, 30, announced their engagement last July and over the summer, revealed that the wedding would take place at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 8.

Engaged: Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara last July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York

Eric's father Donald told MailOnline on Wednesday that 'it's going to be interesting' for Lara to fit her casts into her dress at the wedding.

'She'll either disguise it, or else she'll hold it up proudly. That'll be interesting, right?' he said.

Trump added that even though her wrists are injured, it won't have any effect on exchange of rings. 'At least her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said.

The real estate mogul added that what matters most is that they love each other. 'It's too bad,' he said of the accident. 'But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.'

The couple, who have been together for six years, will begin the wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday November 7, followed by the black-tie ceremony on Saturday and a brunch on Sunday.

Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara last July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York.

Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair, washboard abs and permanent tan.

After graduating from North Carolina State University, she attended the French Culinary Institute where she obtained a degree in Pastry Arts.
