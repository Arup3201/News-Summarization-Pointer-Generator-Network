A team of engineers from Daejon, South Korea, have produced gasoline formed from E. coli for the first time

Few people who have eaten food contaminated with E. coli and have suffered food poisoning as a result could imagine that there might be a good use for the bacteria.

But Korean engineers have discovered a method of producing gasoline from the germ, which adds to the increasing number of biofuels.

The scientists said that the chemical composition of gasoline is quite simple as is is made up almost exclusively of hydrocarbons (or alkanes) with some additives and blending agents.

Increasing concerns about the environment and limited fossil fuels have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from a range of sustainable resources.

Although scientists have successfully produced diesel using microbial methods, they have not had much luck in making gasoline, which is equally in demand as a fuel for various modes of transport.

Researchers have previously made long chain alkanes to create diesel, but have struggled to replicate short-chain hydrocarbons that can be used to create a substance similar to gasoline.

However, the team of engineers from Daejon, South Korea, have cracked the problem to produce gasoline formed from E. coli for the first time, dvice reported.

Korean engineers' discovery of making gasoline from E. coli (pictured) could add to an increasing array of sustainable biofuels as well as potentially leading to people deliberately cooking with an E. coli-derived product, in the form of vegetable oil, and even wearing it in the form of make-up

They did this by using metabolic engineering to make short fatty acid derivatives that allow biosynthesis of short-chain alkanes. which yielded the gasoline as well as fatty esters and alcohols, simply by adding extra enzymes.

Their discovery could lead to people deliberately cooking with an E. coli-derived product - vegetable oil, and even wearing in in the form of make-up.

However, the technique is still in its infancy and on a small scale. It has only produced 580mg of gasoline per litre.

But with refinements in performance, productivity and concentration, it could one day prove a viable and flexible substance.
