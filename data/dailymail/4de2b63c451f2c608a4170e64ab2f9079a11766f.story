A woman who tried to jump over a cemetery fence to escape an alleged attacker had to be cut free after impaling her leg on an iron spike.

Firefighters used saws and grinding tools to rescue the woman who tried to hurdle the perimeter of Vine Cemetery in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, because the nearest gate was locked.

She was then taken to hospital so surgeons could remove the spike which was still sticking out of her thigh.

Stuck: The woman tried to hurdle the 5ft perimeter of Vine Cemetery in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, because the nearest gate was locked

Trapped: The unidentified woman ended up impaled on the iron spike

Response: Firefighters used saws and grinding tools to set the woman free as a passer-by held her up

Witnesses claimed the unidentified woman was running away from someone who attacked her. During her escape, she tried to leap over the fence and got her leg trapped  in the process.

Realising she was stuck, she began to wave her arms frantically in a bid to track down a motorist who called 911.

When fire crews and paramedics arrived, they draped a white cloth over her head to shield her from sparks flying off the saw blade.

The woman remained conscious and alert, talking to the emergency crew throughout the ordeal.

Amber Judge and Dorothy Molion dialed 911 when they saw the woman. 'She was crying big time,' Judge told the Standard Speaker. 

'We helped to hold her up because her other leg was getting numb,' Molion added. 'We were trying to keep her calm because if she panicked, it would have been worse.' 

'She wanted me told hold her hand. She wanted me to stay with her.'

Within 30 minutes of the 911 call, a section of the fence was cut free and crews lifted the woman off the fence with a 5-foot length of iron post still protruding from her leg.

'We removed a section of the fence and sent it with her to the hospital. It was the only way to prevent her from bleeding to death if the spike cut through an artery,' said Fire Chief Brian Mandak. 

A police investigation into the incident is underway. 

Rescue operation: Using the machinery, they cut out a section of the fence so she could be treated

Protection: A white sheet was placed over her to stop the sparks from the saw flying into her face

Pain: The team of emergency service personnel then had to carefully lift the woman from the fence

Treatment: She was taken to hospital with part of the fence sticking out of her thigh
