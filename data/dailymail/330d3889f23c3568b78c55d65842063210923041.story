A rookie Jersey City cop was shot in the head and killed by a man witness say had no plans to rob the store and wanted to kill police so he could become famous.

Melvin Santiago, 23, died instantly early Sunday morning after Lawrence Campbell, 27, took the gun from an armed security guard at a Walgreen’s and shot the officer before he could even get out of his squad car. Campbell was gunned down seconds later by cops on the scene.

Santiago was a lifelong resident of the northern New Jersey city directly across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan and had only last year graduated from Hudson County Community College with a degree in criminal justice.

Heroic death: Jersey City Police Officer Melvin Santiago was gunned down by Lawrence Campbell, a man with multiple drug convictions and suspected in a previous homicide

Campbell, also from Jersey City, stabbed then beat the security guard before remarkably apologizing to a customer for his behavior, WCBS reported.

'Watch the news later, I'm going to be famous!' Campbell told the woman, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said during a Sunday press conference.

The gunman then began firing on the cops as they arrived only minutes later. Police said Sunday that Campbell had also been linked to a previous homicide in the city.

'This guy deserves nothing, his name should be forgotten,' the slain officer's mother, Cathy McBride, told the New York Post.

'Don’t give him any notoriety,' she continued. 'He killed my son. My son was 23 and a good kid and didn’t deserve to get a bullet in his head doing his job, all because someone wanted to be famous.'

Santiago was on the police force less than one year, and his family claimed to the New York Daily News that he was living a childhood dream.

'He’s been dying to be a police officer. His uncle was also a police officer; this is what he wanted to do,' aunt Aggie Hernandez told the paper.

'He was just an amazing person. He was our baby.'

The suspect: The gunman was wearing burgundy sweatpants, according to a witness, his body was lstill on the ground hours after he killed Officer Santiago

Police were called to the 24-hour Walgreen’s about 10 blocks from the city’s Journal Square neighborhood just after 4.00 a.m., WABC reported.

Reports
 differ as to whether Santiago was driving or a passenger, but what is 
clear is that he was shot as he was about to exit the vehicle.

Newspaper delivery person Jean Belviso told the New York Daily News she saw the man, wearing burgundy sweatpants and a baseball cap, walk calmly out of the store.

Also wanted: Police are also searching for Daniel Wilson, who they believe was involved in a previous homicide with Campbell

He then began shooting as Santiago’s police cruiser arrived in the parking lot, she added.

‘We thought he was running, coming toward us,’ said Belviso. ‘He kept on shooting.’

Belviso reported seeing bullets fly through the squad car’s windshield. One of them fatally struck Santiago in the head, others shattered the car’s rear window. Images from the scene showed 13 bullet holes in the car's windshield.

'He was a great guy, he always looked out. Even if you did something bad, he’ll teach you. He taught me a lot,' 12-year-old cousin Jeramiah Hernandez told the Daily News.

'The last time I spoke with him was after his graduation we went to Appleby’s and we celebrated,' the distraught young boy continued. 'That was the last time I saw him.'

Family told the paper he had only graduated from the police academy a few months ago. City payroll records show he was hired by the department July 15, 2013.

Friend Gary Narwold told the Post Santiago was a 'great guy who loved what he did.

'He wanted to work the West District, which is known around here as the Wild, Wild West.'

Another friend identified only as Baruti told the Post that his pal 'was proud to be a cop — it was what he always wanted to do.'

Campbell was an ex-con with multiple drug convictions and prison stints, criminal records showed. His most time behind bars came to an end this past January. That sentence ended two months of freedom after a previous three-year term.

Where it happened: The suspect fled this Walgreen's after mercilessly beating an armed guard and stealing his gun

Shut down: John F. Kennedy Boulevard, one of the city's busiest streets, was closed for hours after the shooting

Ashley 
Etienne, a 17-year-old niece of security guard Pierre Monsanto, says her
 uncle was severely injured in the attack that resulted in the suspect 
taking his gun.

‘We don't know what happened, but he was badly beaten,’ she told the Jersey Journal.

Fulop called it ‘a horrible day’ for the city during a Sunday morning press conference.

‘It
 is a tragic situation when any officer is killed in the line of duty,’ 
Fulop continued. ‘Melvin was an officer who represented everything one 
would want to see in a police officer. 

‘I know the entire city's thoughts and prayers are with the Santiago family during this difficult time and we mourn together.’

The shooter’s dead body remained on the ground more than four hours after police shot him dead, he has yet to be identified.

Show of solidarity: Dozens of cops from both the Jersey City Police Department and the Port Authority Police remained outside Jersey City Medical Center in the hours after Santiago was pronounced dead at the hospital

Officers gathered Sunday morning outside Jersey City Medical Center, where Santiago was pronounced dead, in a show of support for their fallen comrade.

Walgreen’s said no customers or employees were harmed in the incident.

The store has a security guard because of the high crime rate of the area it is in, only blocks from the notoriously crime-ridden, gang-infested Greenville neighborhood.

'My God, it sounded like fireworks,' a local resident identified only as Mike told the paper. 'The amount of shots, and so fast, like 'pow, pow, pow, pow!'

'And then I heard the sirens. Those shots went on forever. I really thought it was fireworks,' Mike continued. 'There's no big staff in there at that time of the night in the Walgreen's... I wouldn't go in there late at night..'

Multiple calls and a message left by MailOnline for further comment from Jersey City police went unanswered.
