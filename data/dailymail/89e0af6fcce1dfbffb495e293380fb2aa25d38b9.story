An NYPD detective wept in court as he described chasing down a suspected cop-killer only to return to the crime scene and find his partner dying from a gunshot wound to the face

Glenn Estrada was chasing  Lamont Pride after he allegedly murdered policeman Peter Figoski during a botched robbery in December 2011.

But today in court Estrada spoke of the moment he returned to find Figoski unresponsive and on a stretcher.

Senseless killing: Lamont Pride is accused of shooting NYPD officer Peter Figoski in the face

With Figoski's daughters in court, he wiped tears back as he spoke about his partner of four years, who he considered a 'brother.'

Another officer, who was the
first to find Figoski, took the stand after Estrada, 43,

'I
still didn’t recognize the male until I looked down to the waist and I 
saw a revolver,' said Officer Mario Gandini reported the New York Post.

'Then I knew it 
was Officer Figoski. He was the only one who backed us up with a 
revolver,' Gandini said.

He explained this was clear to him because some of the older cops, like 
Figsoki, still carried revolvers instead of the newer standard-issue 
Glock semiautomatics.

Gandini explained he ran to his patrol car to find something to cover Figoski’s face, but couldn’t find anything suitable.

The father-of-four was pronounced dead 
several hours later at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. 

The 47-year-old could have retired two years before with a full pension.

Pride and the alleged getaway driver Michael Velez are both on trial for murder.

Two other men involved in the robbery will face trial later this year, while a third cooperated in exchange for a plea deal.

In court prosecutors played surveillance videos that showed Estrada chasing Pride for four blocks

Figoski
and Estrada were part of a back-up team of officers who responded to a report of a break-in at the basement apartment in the East New York section of Brooklyn, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

The building owner, who lives on the first and second floors, called 911 at about 2:15am.

The first officers walked toward the back of basement to help three men they thought were robbery victims, reported Huffington Post.

They
passed a room where Pride and Velez were hiding, prosecutors said, and 
as the officers were helping the supposed victims, Pride slipped out of a
side room behind them.

Just as he was making his escape, he ran into Figoski on the stairs.

Police said Estrada was outside, struggling with another suspect.

After the chase police recovered a silver semi-automatic pistol under a parked car near where Pride was arrested.

The trial continues.
