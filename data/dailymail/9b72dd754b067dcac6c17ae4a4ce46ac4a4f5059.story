Yaya Toure wants to meet with Manchester City to thrash out his future, according to his controversial agent.

Toure's days at the Etihad Stadium may be numbered, with City prepared to listen to offers for the 31-year-old and the player himself admitting he is open to new challenges.

Now the Ivory Coast international's agent Dimitri Seluk has revealed that he wants to talk to City about the way forward.

'We have had different offers for Yaya but we must speak to Manchester City,' Seluk said.

'People think he will stay because of money but we don't care about money. If Man City don't want him - no problem. 

'I want someone to say that they want Yaya to stay at Manchester City. Yaya is a legend at the club. All the supporters like him, he's helped them make history.'

Despite Seluk's claims, the fact that Toure earns more than £1m a month at City could yet put a spanner in the works of a potential transfer to a club like Inter Milan in Italy.

Toure has two years left on his current contract but has not managed to have the same influence on Manuel Pellegrini's team this season.
