'After dating for five years, my relationship with Irina Shayk has come to an end. We believed it would be best for both of us to take this step now.' 

Ronaldo showed no sign of being down after his split from Shayk when he was spotted picking up his son - Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr - from a school in Madrid.

A couple of admirers had waited nearby and asked the sportsman for a selfie, and he happily obliged, appearing to be in good spirits. 

He became a father back in July 2010 and has previously admitted that being a parent changed him.

'Of course something like this affects you. It's a different type of responsibility,' he said

'Maybe I feel more comfortable. I'm comfortable when things are going well: my family, the club, my friends, that gives me important support for everything else.

'I would love him to like football, for him to be my successor, but we'll see what happens.

'My son will be whatever he wants,' he added.

The identity of the mother has never been revealed, but it was reported in 2011 that she was a 20-year-old British student who was paid £10million to give up her parental rights. 

Ronaldo's split from the stunning model, whom he'd been with for five years, was confirmed at the weekend, after days of speculation after she unfollowed him on Twitter.

She was also notably absent at his third prestigious Ballon d'Or win celebration on January 12.

However, in her absence was a sports journalist Villalon who was also pictured celebrating with him on the day in Irina's absence.

'There are 3! Golden ball congratulations! Zurich 12/01/15,' she wrote in the caption. 

The popular star was approached by another admirer who was keen on speaking to Ronaldo

Victoria's Secret beauty Shayk's spokesperson revealed on Saturday: 'We can confirm Irina Shayk has ended her relationship to Cristiano Ronaldo of five years.'

A massive argument between his mother and his long-time love may have resulted in the demise of their romance.

Ronaldo's alleged new flame, who is an avid follower of his successful sports career, is a state broadcaster who graduated with law and journalism degrees.

The 26-year-old noticeably braved the plummeting temperatures and sat in the stands at Real Madrid's game against Getafe on Sunday, cheering on the world-famous star with a couple of girlfriends.
