Gold Coast police are preparing for a painfully long fortnight as Schoolies Week hits full swing this week. 

A hot weekend saw 19 arrests for antisocial behaviour and police were called to break up a brawl between two girls at Cavill Avenue in Surfers Paradise. 

Another fight broke out between 10 young men, with one suffering a broken nose.The mayhem is expected to increase later this week when students from NSW and Victoria join the party. 

Surfers Paradise was awash with up to 30,000 school leavers on Sundaynight, as  teenagers drank away into the night.

A young woman was left with a bloodied face after what could have been an alleged assault on the first day of Schoolies celebrations on Saturday night, but police say they know nothing about it.

The picture was posted to social media and police are aware of it but say they have not received any complaints over the alleged incident and have no information about the young woman and could not confirm whether there had been a brawl or fight. 

Despite this, police have praised the general behaviour of party goers which saw more than 30,000 Schoolies descend on the party capital of Australia for the week long celebrations.

Officers arrested 35 non-Schoolies on 40 charges, mainly for public nuisance-type offences, three non-Schoolies also received fines for public drinking.

'Generally police were pleased with the behaviour of Schoolies, with only a small number of the large crowd coming to the attention of police,' a Queensland Police Service statement said. 

Gold Coast Schoolies advisory board chairman Mark Reaburn said up to 18,000 school leavers went through the gates of the designated entertainment hub on the beach from 7pm to midnight.

'It’s all going as planned,' he told the Gold Coast bulletin.

Up to 30,000 school leavers are expected to party at Surfers Paradise clubs and pubs on Sunday night.

Grant Gehrke from Red Frogs, an internationally recognised Schoolies support organisation, says first night of celebrations he's been pretty impressed with the scope of the Schoolies behaviour.

Party organisers encouraged the teenagers to keep hydrated during the festivities 

16,000 wristbands were given out to party-goers as a way of identifying the Schoolies from the 'Toolies' 

'First night quiet and healthy generally,' he said, 'I would say generally say harmless fun, they settle in, scope out the place and weren’t doing too much a lot on the beach, having fun enjoying themselves.' 

He says there were over 16,000 wristbands given out to Schoolies, as a deterrent to identify 'Toolies' and over the week it builds.

Red Frogs has a 24/7 hotline for Schoolies to contact when in need and they can support Schoolies by taking them home at night if they have lost friends.

There were 42 schoolies issued with fines for drinking in public on Saturday night

'We can meet them anywhere across the coast and walk back them to hotel with a team of four,' he said.

As the name suggests they also give out red frogs but the bucketload. 

'Give four to five tonnes out across Australia in 14 different locations, it's an ice breaker, a lot of kids are excited to have us visit their hotel.'

A large police presence during the week-long event will be supported by about 1000 volunteers who will mingle with revellers, keeping an eye out for trouble and offering support

'We also give out pancake shakers, add water, each team carries, it's there to gain trust with the kids.'

Red Frogs also have about eight teams to go to Bali next week.  

'Volunteers there's over 1500 nationally, Victoria has four locations to kick off from Saturday, WA and Rottnest Island started today with over 100 volunteers.'

'On the Gold Coast we have 11 support services,' said Mr Gehrke.

'For Schoolies we spread the message to take responsibility for their own actions, drink plenty of water, don’t go anywhere alone, look after friends, and don't let social media ruin your future.' 

Police have expressed their concerns over persistent drug dealers, peddling toxic narcotics to vulnerable teens coming of age in the party town.

Police and local support organisations for schoolies have warned kids not to put inappropriate images on social media

The young teens are seen as a hot market for money thirsty drug dealers and police believe substandard drugs may be peddled due to a string of recent crack downs on the narcotics.  

Speaking to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Major and Organised Crime Squad boss Detective Inspector Scott Knowles said suppliers will be looking to fill the demand and the quality of drugs would no doubt be inferior. 

'They don't have quality control. Their only interest is to make money and walk away, so it's the youth who wear the consequences.' he said.  

There was music and festivities all night long for schoolies on the Gold Coast

A large police presence during the week-long event will be supported by about 1000 volunteers who will mingle with revellers, keeping an eye out for trouble and offering support. 

More than 250 officers will maintain a highly visible patrol through streets and hotels during the week-long festival. 

Authorities have warned those attending to be safe and watch out for each other.

Police have also cautioned Schoolies against posting inappropriate photos on social media, saying they could come back to haunt them. 

Authorities have said that Surfers Paradise remains a popular spot for school leavers to party, although some are choosing to head overseas to Bali and Fiji. 

Acting Chief Superintendent Des Lacy says the main concern was people jumping from balcony to balcony on high-rise buildings.

'We've already seen catastrophes occur when that happens,' he told media this week.

'What we ask of young people ... (is) if you see that sort of behaviour please let us know.'

A 17-year-old schoolgirl from Brisbane fell to her death from a Surfers Paradise balcony two years ago.

Supt Lacy says his main message to those attending celebrations is to look out for one another.

'As the slogan says: `Be safe, watch your mates',' he said.

He also cautioned party-goers against posting inappropriate photos online as they could be viewed by potential employers. 

The main concern each year was excess alcohol consumption, although schoolies had been more tame over the past few years, he said. 

Last year Queensland Ambulance Service staff treated about 500 schoolies within designated party precincts on the Gold Coast.

Most were treated for minor injuries, such as cuts, but many were treated for alcohol intoxication and a small number were treated for illicit drug use.

Assistant Commissioner Dee Taylor-Dutton reminded those attending to keep hydrated, with temperatures expected to reach the high 20s.
