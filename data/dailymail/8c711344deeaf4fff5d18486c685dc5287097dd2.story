Lance Armstrong has accused world cycling chief Brian Cookson of showing too much leniency in the sport’s ongoing battle against drugs.

Cookson, the former head of British cycling, has left himself open to such accusations after the International Cycling Union allowed Astana to retain their World Tour licence despite five of their riders testing positive for banned substances.

And Armstrong even cited the UCI’s decision to ‘rush’ through Team Sky's request for Chris Froome to get emergency steroid treatment for asthma.

Speaking in his latest interview, this time with the BBC, Armstrong said Cookson’s predecessor – Pat McQuaid – would have been ‘lynched’ had it happened on his watch.

‘If McQuaid had made the same decisions Cookson has made in his first year, he would have been lynched,’ said the man stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for drug use. Do we like what we have got so far?’

Armstrong rode for Astana after a four-year break from the sport in 2009, but the team that is run by convicted drug cheat Alexander Vinokourov have seen five of their riders caught by testers in the last year. It is also the team that boasts the winner of last year’s Tour, Vincenzo Nibali.

Armstrong said ‘everybody thinks’ Astana should have been kicked off the World Tour, while he also criticised Cookson for failing to get team managers like Vinokourov and Tinkoff-Saxo's Bjarne Riis (another former doper) to cooperate with the panel set up by the UCI to investigate cycling’s drug culture.

The American has talked to the Cycling Independent Reform Commission twice and is now waiting to see if his efforts will be rewarded with a recommendation that his lifetime ban from sport should be reduced when CIRC delivers its report next month.

But he is disappointed there has not been more pressure on Vinokourov and Riis – successful riders from the Armstrong era – to also give evidence. Armstrong certainly has a point.

‘If I'm Brian Cookson, I would make it a deal point that you have to come in and talk,’ he said.

‘So if Riis doesn't talk to you, or Vinokourov doesn't, there should be consequences. I don't know those to be examples, but I can imagine.

‘If you don't come in to talk, you don't just get passed.’
