Apple is to unveil the new generation iPhone at an event next month, insiders say.

It is believed the event, allegedly on September 10, will see the launch of the upcoming iPhone 5S and possibly also a rumoured 'low-cost' device.

Indicated updates on the iPhone 5S 
include sensor which can identify the owner by his or her fingerprints.

The new generation iPhone expected to be launched on September 10 will run new software iOS 7 and possibly include a finger-print scanner

Photographs have leaked of a smartphone 
dubbed ‘5C’, supposedly intended as a cheaper version of the popular 
iPhone, with a plastic case.

Due to its relatively expensive price tag, Apple is struggling to succeed in emerging markets, something which the rumoured September event could change, according to AllthingsD.

Previously the company has solved this problem by offering its old models at a lower price, but cheaper Android phones have seen their market share dip, the tech-website said.

Rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest iOS7 Software implied a scanner function.

Price drop: It has also been rumoured that Apple will launch a low-cost device, the plastic-case Iphone 5C, to target mid- and emerging markets

The code describes a user touching the 
Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, 
that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 
'recognition is complete'.

code discovered in iOS 7 suggests phones running the software will be 
able to record video at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather 
than around 30 frames per second.

This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films. 

The iOS 7 software also lets users swipe between menus, select apps and control the device's screen using just head movements.

A string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software, pictured, gives the strongest indication to date that either the iPhone 5S or the iPhone 6 could have a fingerprint scanner

When the Switch Control feature is enabled, it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps.

When the required section is highlighted, users can move their head to the left to select it.

Other new features include Night Mode in Maps that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark.

The new iOS7 software for iPhone includes a radical redesign of menus and icons as well as improved notifications and better photo-organising abilities.
