This is the moment a group of football hooligans, including a town councillor, start drunkenly brawling on a train while terrified passengers watch on.

The shocking scenes, caught on CCTV, show a group of 15 Nottingham Forest and Doncaster Rovers fans packed into a small area punching and kicking each other.

Town councillor Steven Marsden, 53, from New Balderton, Nottinghamshire, also threw a bottle into the raging fight - slicing the nostril of another man.

This shocking image shows a brawl between 15 Forest and Rovers fans aboard a Leeds-bound train. One man can be seen launching at another with his arms raised as another is pushed backwards behind him

The men, who all boarded the train in London Kings Cross, throw punches at one another. At one point Town Councillor Steven Marsden throws a bottle in to the group - with broken glass from the object showering over the hooligans

Passengers and staff ran for safety as the brawl spilled out onto the 
platform of Newark station in Nottinghamshire.

The group were jailed for a total of 60 years at Nottingham Crown Court.

The court heard how the two groups boarded the same Leeds-bound train at London Kings Cross on April 27 last year.

Jamie Johnson, a Forest 
fan, was involved in an argument with a Doncaster fan as the train left 
London.

He then phoned a friend in Newark, Nottinghamshire, saying he feared for his safety.

When the train pulled in to the station, five friends of Johnson were waiting on the platform.

Another CCTV image shows the fight developing. The tension began when the group got on to the train in London - with one Forest fan Jamie Johnson getting in to an argument with a Doncaster fan

Johnson then called his friends, saying he feared for his safety. The group of five men then waited for the train to arrive in to Newark station

The group, all Forest fans, began banging on the windows before the two groups confronted each other by an exit lobby.

Chris Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'They banged on the windows of the train, so Doncaster Rovers supporters in the carriage reacted to that undoubted provocation, and made their way to vestibule areas of carriages E and F.

'Doncaster Rovers Supporters goaded Nottingham Forest supporters on the platform. It was clear each group were threatening each other. Violence broke out in vestibule F and on the platform.

'It was clear each group were threatening each other. What began as a scuffle soon developed into a brawl.

More men pile into the fight from the platform. The men were jailed for a total of 60 years for a series of crimes including assault

Passengers and staff fled the carriage for their own safety. Judge Andrew Hamilton said the incident was 'disgraceful'

'Punches were thrown, kicks delivered, members of the group used violence toward each other. Beer bottles and cans were thrown.'

Town Councillor Steven Marsden pleaded guilty to wounding and affray after he launched a bottle into the raging brawl.

He was jailed for 12 months after the court heard the bottle slashed co-accused Ashley Allen's nostril.

Allen, 19, a Rovers fan from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was left with permanent facial scarring following the attack. He admitted affray and was conditionally discharged for 18 months and banned from football matches for three years.

Judge Andrew Hamilton said: 'It's a 
moment of madness Mr Allen will have to live with for the rest of his 
life. This was a disgraceful incident.'

Other
 Forest fans on the train were Jamie Johnson, 30, of Warburton Street, 
Newark, and Ian Watson, 30, of Tennyson Street, Balderton, who both 
admitted affray.

Johnson, 
who was involved in the argument in London and called his friend in 
Newark, was jailed for 12 months and received a six-year banning order.

Watson got an 18-month community order, with 140 hours of unpaid work and a £400 costs order. He was banned from football grounds for three years.

Other Forest fans convicted of affray were Christopher Cox, 48, of Coddington, Nottinghamshire, and Danny Smalley, 25, of Newark, who were both sentenced to 12 months in prison and handed six year football banning orders.

Luca Tricarico, 23, of Leyland, Nottinghamshire, was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for 18 months, 180 hours unpaid community work, £400 costs and a three year football banning order.

Steven Jaye, 25, and Benjamin Weir, 22, of Newark, were both given a three month prison term suspended for 18 months, 140 hours unpaid community work, £400 costs and a three year football banning order.

Seven Doncaster Rovers fans were also sentenced, three, Jordann Whitnall, 19, of Thorne, 43-year-old Graham Howarth of Scawthorpe; and Nigel Barnes, 42, of Scawthorpe, were jailed for o four months in prison, suspended for 18 months, 140 hours unpaid community work, ordered to pay £400 costs and handed three year football banning orders.

A further three men, Mark Redfearn, 42, of Armthorpe; 45-year-old Gary Flately of Balby; and Andrew Toyne, 23, of Kirk Sandall, were handed 140 hours of unpaid community work each, three year football banning orders and ordered to pay costs of £200 for Section 4 Public Order offences of threatening behaviour.

Afterwards, British Transport Police Detective Inspector Glen Alderson said: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for the passengers and staff who were at the station and on the train at the time of the incident. They were left fearing for their safety and understandably shaken and traumatised by the incident.

'Glass bottles were thrown and one of the defendants involved in the fighting was stabbed in the face with a broken bottle.

'We quickly launched an investigation and detectives worked hard to gather evidence against each of the fifteen defendants.

'We simply do not tolerate this type of violent and barbaric behaviour. We've had great success in dealing with football related disorder, and serious incidents such as this are thankfully very rare on the railway network.

'By working closely with clubs, the rail industry, and football authorities, we're making inroads into tackling the type crime that can ruin match days for law-abiding fans and members of the public.

'I hope that being banned from the club, along with the sentences handed down today serves as a stark reminder that football related disorder on the rail network is utterly unacceptable and will seek the maximum penalties for anyone involved.'
