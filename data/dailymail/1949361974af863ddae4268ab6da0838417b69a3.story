Located in 163 stunning acres of lush parkland, the drive up to Galgorm is breathtaking.

With the raging River Maine on one side, the 18th-century former country house stands proud as we pass well-kept lawns and towering trees.

Nestled in the Belfast countryside, it’s clear to see why this is a haven for celebrities wanting to relax and get away from it all.

Country retreat: Galgorm Resort & Spa is 30 minutes outside Belfast in Ireland and is nestled in 163 acres of beautiful countryside

Stunning views: Guests can order afternoon tea in the conservatory which overlooks the River Maine

Misha Barton, Jemma Kidd, Michael Fassbender and Liam Neeson have all stayed at the luxurious Galgorm Resort & Spa, which is 30 minutes from Belfast city centre.

Inside boasts 75 contemporary-decorated bedrooms, three restaurants as well as a top-class spa with treatment suites, a glitzy Boudoir room and an outdoor hot-tub.

Also available are one and two bedroom self-catering cottages and log cabins.

My friend and I check into our spacious twin room, which overlooks the horse stables and idyllic woodland.

Beautiful location: The resort - which dates back to the 18th century - started life as a country house

And relax... the resort offers a host of treatments, including massages in a room for two

Galgorm’s estate is vast. As well as fishing, there’s pigeon shooting, archery, walking, jogging, mountain biking and horse riding as well as golf nearby.

But I’m here for the spa. Inside is luxurious and beautifully designed, using local stone and natural wood.

Guests are free to wander around in robes, taking advantage of the facilities on offer before being pampered with a massage or facial.

I while away a few hours going in and out of the five sauna and steam rooms – each of which offers a different type of heat and temperatures, and there's also an ice fountain for those who are brave enough and want to cool themselves down afterwards.

There’s also an infinity hydrotherapy pool, and an outdoor Jacuzzi pool – as well as thermal water-heated stone-loungers in an all-glass conservatory-style building, overlooking the lawns outside.

Afternoon tea is on offer in the River Restaurant Conservatory which overlooks the stunning grounds where Galgorm is situated

The resort offers treatments for couples - including an aromatherapy bath, during which guests can enjoy a glass of bubbly

It would be easy to lose an entire day here, but I have a massage booked.

Upstairs is where visitors will find The Boudoir - a glamorous, pink, gold and bling-style room with hanging see-through pod chairs that is available for women to hire for parties or exclusive events.

I wander to my treatment room – inside which guests can also arrange a Cleopatra Bath priced at £30 to laze for 25 minutes in a hydrating milk bath.

My therapist’s build is incredibly slight, which leads me into a false sense of security. Gentle she is not.

Using her fingers, knuckles and even her elbows, she attempts – and succeeds - to work out all the knots that are in my back and shoulders.

Breathtaking setting: Galgorm is situated next to the raging River Main which offers an incredible backdrop for photos

There are three onsite restaurants for guests to use - including a pub and an Italian eatery. Pictured: The Conservatory 

Homely decor: The suites at the resort have recently been refurbished and now boast a modern design

And it’s not until after my treatment that she reveals she used to massage body builders.

Feeling rejuvenated, I head inside the resort for lunch at the River Room where afternoon tea is served in a conservatory with floor-to-ceiling panoramic views of the powerful river.

It’s where guests can also enjoy fine dining in the evening, matching dishes to an extensive wine menu and a port selection from the hotel’s cellars.

It’s slightly out of our price range, so we opt to dine at Italian restaurant Fratelli that night.

Travel like an A-lister: The retreat has hosted a number of celebrities

Carol stayed  at Galgorm Retreat & Spa. A two-night stay in a superior room costs from £149pp based on two sharing. It includes a three-course evening meal with a bottle of house wine in either Gillies Bar & Grill or Fratelli, afternoon tea and breakfast Monday to Thursday during December. BA flies from London to Belfast from £49 one way.

Inside boasts a rustic decor with a roaring fire in the middle - perfect for winter evenings.

We spend the evening stuffing our faces with garlic bread dripping with cheese, spicy pasta and creamy mozzarella, followed by cheesecake and washed down with a few glasses of wine.

The on-site pub Gillies Bar & Grill is still lively as we walk through to head back to our room.

Live Irish music is blasting out, and there are large open log fires, exposed beams and stone walls completing the country-getaway style.

But we carry on walking through.

As tempting as it is to join the party, there’s an entire day of lazing by the pool to be up early for tomorrow...
