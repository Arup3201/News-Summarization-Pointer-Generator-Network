Accused: Ryan Wyngarden goes on trial this week for the murder of his sister and her husband

The jury in the murder trial of a Michigan man accused of killing his sister and her husband for fear that she would reveal their incestuous love affair on Tuesday heard opening statements from the prosecution and the defense, which painted two very different pictures of the double homicide.

Ryan Wyngarden, a 52-year-old married father-of-four from Zeeland, stands accused of shooting dead Gail and Rick Brink in their Park Township home in November 1987, only 18 months after their wedding.

The prosecution in the case opened the trial Tuesday in Grand Haven by trying to convince the jury that the killings were premeditated – and that Wyngarden had admitted to his wife that he murdered the couple.

Ottawa County Assistant Prosecutor Lee Fisher said in court that Mr Wyngarden was jealous of the relationship between his sister and her newlywed husband, and that the defendant was concerned that Gail Brink might reveal the truth about their sexual relationship.

Wyngarden's defense team insisted that the 52-year-old man was innocent and had an alibi for the time of the murder, MLive.com. 

Defense attorney David Hall laid out a theory where a motorcycle gang with connections to a drug ring may have been behind the slayings.

The defense also insisted that no incest had occurred between the siblings during their teenage years.

The case of Rick and Gail Brink laid unsolved until investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview Wyngarden and his wife.

At first, Pam Wyngarden stuck to the 
story she had repeated for decades: that she and her husband were 
visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at 
the time of the killings.

But during interviews in January 2013,
 the mother-of-four changed her story, saying that she could no longer hide his secret and claiming that her husband had 
admitted to shooting dead the Brinks.

At
 a hearing in February 2013, she said they had only been dating a few 
months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he 
feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as 
teenagers.

'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.'

Killed: Rick and Gail Brink were shot dead in their home in November 1987, 18 months after they married

Victims: Wyngarden allegedly shot the couple because he was worried she would reveal they had sex as teens

At a hearing last year, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating.

'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, "What's wrong?" and he said, "I shot and killed Rick and Gail". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.'

When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said.

Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one.

She said she married him regardless of 
his confession because she craved love and support for her and her two 
children, one of whom was his.

According to the prosecution, Mrs Wyngarden told detectives that her husband brought her to his late sister's home and showed her where Gail and her husband were killed.

Afterwards, the 52-year-old man allegedly warned her: 'If you ever tell anyone about this, the same thing is going to happen to you.'

Pam Wyngarden is expected to take the stand and testify against her husband as the star witness for the prosecution.

Fisher told the jurors Tuesday that the married woman will talk about how her husband allegedly left angry voicemails for investigators after they questioned the couple in October 2012.

Mr Hall, who represents Wyngarden, said in court that his client stills stands by his alibi.

In his opening statement, the defense attorney raised the possibility that the Brinks couple may have been victims in a case of mistaken identity.

According to Hall, the previous owners of Gail and Rick's Park Township home, who had moved out not long before the murders, had been linked to narcotics trade and had connections to a Detroit-area biker gang.

The previous homeowner, who was said to be a one-time police informant, is expected to testify during the trial as a witness for the defense.

The trial is expected to last two weeks. Wyngarden remains in the Ottawa County Jail.

Denial: Wyngarden sobbed throughout the hearing in February 2013 and yelled that he was not guilty

In the years after Wyngarden allegedly
 told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and 
would not allow her to have any friends in fear that she would tell 
them, she said.

As she spoke in court last year, her husband sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't!'

But Crystal Beelen, a former girlfriend of 
Wyngarden's, also testified that Wyngarden admitted that 
he had had a sexual relationship with his sister when they were 
teenagers.

The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding.

In the hearing last year, Mrs Brink said she found her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home.

The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths.

The case fell cold as investigators found
 no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been 
victims of mistaken identity.

Ottawa County Sheriff's Capt. Mark Bennett told Michigan Live
 that several civilians, retired officers and sheriff's detectives are 
expected to return to the town to testify about the on-scene 
investigation.

The trial is expected to take at least two weeks. If convicted, Wyngarden would face a sentence of life in prison.
