The Ministry of Defence will not be bringing in mandatory pregnancy tests for women despite a British soldier who did not know she was pregnant giving birth on the frontline in Afghanistan.

There has been growing pressure for testing servicewomen before they head to the frontline after a Fijian-born British servicewoman had a son in Camp Bastion on Tuesday – just days after the Taliban launched a deadly attack on the UK’s main base in Helmand.

It has also been revealed that 200 women have had to be sent home from Afghanistan and Iraq since 2003 because they have been pregnant.

But this is 
the first time a UK soldier has given birth to a baby in Afghanistan.

Camp Bastion, Afghanistan: A Fijian woman soldier stationed at the British base in Helmand gave birth on Tuesday. The super fit squaddie did not even realise she was pregnant

Unexpected task: The soldier, who has not been named, was taken to Camp Bastion's £10million field hospital where Army medics delivered her baby

Currently soldiers have hearing, sight, blood and weight-related tests but nothing to find out if they are carrying a baby.

'No, we will not be bringing in mandatory pregnancy tests. We do not test women for lots of things and believe it really is up to them to come forward if they are pregnant,'  a MoD spokesman told MailOnline.

'The problem is that we could test them before they go but they could only produce a positive test weeks later. So we do not do it.

'There is only about ten cases a year and as soon as they find out we sent them home.'

The baby was born five weeks premature and both mother and child were said to be doing well.

A 'specialist paediatric retrieval team' 
from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford will travel to Afghanistan in
 the next few days to provide care for the soldier and her son on their 
RAF flight home.

The birth has stunned military chiefs and led to calls for extra medical checks on women who are sent to the warzone. 

The
 soldier, a gunner in the Royal Artillery who helped provide covering 
fire for troops fighting insurgents, was unaware that she was carrying a
 child.

She had been deployed with the 12th Mechanised Brigade since March, but two days ago complained of severe stomach pains.

Can you be pregnant on the front line?  

The MoD says that nobody can be deployed on operations if they are pregnant and if they fall pregnant or are found to be pregnant on tour then they will be sent home immediately.

If they are at sea then they will be taken to the nearest port and sent home.

As soon as they get back their duties until maternity leave starts will ensure they are kept healthy and safe.

Are there pregnancy tests carried out before tours?

No, testing of this kind does not happen on the basis that they believe a person would not knowingly go on tour when they are pregnant. Personnel have hearing, eyesight and blood tests, as well as BMI measurements, but no pregnancy test at the moment. Although this new case may increase the pressure for one.

What if they are on active service in the UK?

A pregnant woman can remain in the job up until the 28th week of pregnancy then they must stand down. She will be medically assessed and must have another one before she returns to work.

When can they return to front line duties?

No servicewoman will be sent a warzone until at least six months after they have given birth, unless they volunteer - but this still may be subject to certain conditions.

To her astonishment, medics informed her that she was about to give birth.

She was in the 34th week of her pregnancy, meaning she conceived before flying to Afghanistan for her six-month tour of duty.

She
 was taken to Camp Bastion’s £10million field hospital where doctors – 
who are  more used to carrying out amputations and treating bullet 
wounds – delivered her son.

Despite its location, the hospital is one of the best equipped in the world and has portable X-ray machines, an operating theatre, CAT scanner and an intensive care unit capable of treating up to 20 seriously-ill patients.

A military source said: ‘This has left us completely gobsmacked. You prepare yourself for dealing with war wounded at Bastion – not a mother giving birth to a baby. It is the talk of the camp.

‘This is a very unusual case. The mother deployed not realising she was pregnant and had no idea she was pregnant until she gave birth. She has not done anything wrong.’

Lieutenant Colonel Andrea Lewis, commanding officer of the field hospital, said: ‘This is a unique occurrence, but my team is well-rehearsed in the unexpected and they adapted brilliantly to this situation.

‘I am pleased to report the mother and baby are doing well and we are all delighted at the outcome.’

The Fijian soldier had passed her tough pre-deployment training, which included a gruelling eight-mile march and five-mile run, without an inkling that she was pregnant.

A senior Army insider said: ‘It is bizarre that she didn’t feel some side effects of the pregnancy. She is obviously pretty fit and strong. The strains and demands on soldiers working on the frontline make it surprising she didn’t realise.

Emergency treatment: Bastion's medics are more used to treating bullet and blast wounds than delivering infants

'But the conditions of deployment, the different diet, the heat of the Afghan summer, the different hours of working, mean that many soldiers feel a little odd and put it down to the change of environment.

‘The baby’s successful delivery is a wonderful testament to the outstanding job the medics do here. It shows how they can use their extraordinary skills to turn their hands from saving lives to delivering babies.

‘A lot of the medics are reservists and work in hospitals back in the UK so the concept of someone giving birth is not completely alien to them. But they do not have paediatric equipment here so they had to make do as best they could.’

A woman killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul left a final message on Twitter weeks before she died, reading: ‘I am back in Afghanistan and wonder what lies before me this time.’

Jeni Ayris, pictured right, of Edinburgh, died alongside 11 fellow aviation workers when a female insurgent rammed a car laden with explosives into their minibus as they drove to the airport on Tuesday.

She had been due to leave the country this weekend to see friends and her sister Patricia.

Islamist body Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack. It said the bombing was a response to a US film lampooning the Prophet Muhammad, which has sparked lethal riots across the globe.

South African-born Miss Ayris, 46, had spent 17 years in the Scottish capital.

She had been in Afghanistan to organise flights for charities and non-governmental organisations.

A friend, Richard Kellett, said: ‘She loved her job. She would go out there for three months at a time . . . when she came home on leave she always looked forward to going back.’

A statement from Miss Ayris’s family described her as ‘a warm, kind and generous person with an everyday objective of  helping everyone she met’.

Major Charles Heyman, who edits the 
British Army handbook, said the incident was ‘astonishing’. He said: 
‘Commanders need to start thinking very, very carefully about what sort 
of medical examinations female soldiers have before they deploy on 
operations.

'A simple urine test would indicate if someone was pregnant. The Army now needs to tighten up its procedures.’

Since 2003 at least 70 British servicewomen have been sent home from Afghanistan after discovering they were expecting. And at least 102 female soldiers were evacuated from Iraq after it was found they were pregnant.

Last year the Mail told how Private Kayla Donnelly, then 21, from Penrith, Cumbria, served in Helmand unaware that she was seven months’ pregnant.

She had conceived before going to Afghanistan as a machine-gunner and thought her weight gain was due to high-calorie Army rations. It was only when she collapsed in Tenerife after her tour of duty that she realised she was pregnant.

Around 500 British women are currently on duty in Afghanistan. They can serve in any unit except those whose primary role is to ‘close with and kill’ –  engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.

Eight women have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, two per cent of the total fatalities. They include Corporal Sarah Bryant, 26, from Carlisle, serving with the Army Intelligence Corps, who was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2008, and Second Lieutenant Joanna Dyer, 24, from Yeovil, a friend of Prince William and also of the Army Intelligence Corps, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007.
