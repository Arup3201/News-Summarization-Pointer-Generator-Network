A hacker turned FBI informant has warned that the US government is failing to protect Americans from cyber attacks which could shut down airports, phone systems, and water supplies.

Hector Monsegur, one of the founding members of LulzSec - an offshoot of notorious hacking group Anonymous - claims the nation relies on rogue security contractors like Edward Snowden to thwart external threats.

With no body monitoring the FBI-employed hackers, he says, national security is fragile and easily destructible. 

Warning: Hector Montsegur, a former hacker who caused $50 million damages, warns the current security system is flawed and fragile, insisting that the US is doing little to protect citizens from potential cyber attacks

'In all reality there is no security,' Monsegur told CBS's Charlie Rose, in his first interview after avoiding jail thanks to allegedly preventing 300 attacks and securing seven arrests.

The 31-year-old's own hacks that led to his arrest caused up to $50 million damages, including one sting on an FBI-affiliated firm.

'Hackers could break right into the airport, the phone systems, obviously, the water supply systems - shut them down,' he said.

'It should be an inspiration to the American government to focus on our infrastructure. 

'We have a sickening reliance on security contractors, the companies that Edward Snowden worked for.

'Who will guard the guards, Charlie? Our security, the people we pay for - the people we hire with tax dollars - are not really secure themselves.'

Montsegur became an FBI informant after the bureau threatened him with 26 years in prison and potential harm to his two children. 

Under the code name Sabu, Montsegur had already inflicted around 250 attacks, including one of the Tunisian government's internal system at the height of the Arab Spring.

Back story: Montsegur was a prominent hacker before he was caught by the FBI and became an informant

Secrets: He was enlisted to relay his conversations with fellow hackers to the bureau for investigations

'It was amazing,' Montsegur said of his life as a 'hacktivist'. 

'I saw finally I was able to do something that contributed to society regardless if I was at home in the Lower East Side, in the projects, behind a computer.'

Eventually, he was hooked. 

'After you're hacking for so long you reach a point of no return,' he said. 'Regardless if you fear that they're gonna get you one day, it's too late.'

But he shocked the hacking community when he turned against them following an offer from the FBI.

It is a move that was praised by a judge as extraordinarily helpful. 

'That personal characteristic of turning on a dime and doing good and not evil is the most important factor in this sentence,' said US District Judge Loretta Preska at his sentencing in May.

Preska imposed a term of seven months behind bars — equal to what he'd already served — which means Monsegur was a free man after his sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court. 

In his CBS interview, Montsegur explains how he didn't think twice about the bureau's offer when an agent threatened his children.

Didn't think twice: Montsegur says he had no qualms about switching sides after they threatened his children

'He said, "Well, we know who you are, we know what you're doing, and we also know you have two kids in the house. You make the decision",' he recalled. 

'So it's clear as day they had an understanding that my weakness was the kids.'

For the next three years, he continued interacting with Anonymous and LulzSec - but under the watchful eye of federal detectives.

'I was able to intercept attacks that were happening against the government and -- share it with the government so they could fix these issues,' Montsegur said.

Controversially, Montsegur defiantly insists he did not unmask his fellow 'hacktivists', insisting he merely provided data that the FBI used to make arrests.

'It wasn't a situation where I identified anybody. I didn't point my fingers at nobody,' he said. 'My cooperation entailed logging and providing intelligence. It didn't mean, "Can you please tell me the identity of one of your mates?"'
