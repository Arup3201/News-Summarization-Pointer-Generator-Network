A lawsuit has been filed against Facebook claiming the social-networking site is systematically snooping on private messages to mine data that it sells to advertisers.

Matthew Campbell from Pulaski County, Arkansas, and Michael Hurley from North Plains, Oregon, argue that Facebook has ‘systematically violated consumers’ privacy by reading its users’ personal, private Facebook messages without their consent’.

The suit claims that the messages are scanned if an address to a third-party website is included in the message.

This link is then analysed to build a profile of the user, it argues.

According to the suit, independent security researchers have discovered that Facebook analyses users’ private messages not to aid their transmission, but to ‘mine… data and profit from those data by sharing them with third parties, namely advertisers, marketers, and other data aggregators’.

Users, it reasons, 'are likely to reveal facts about themselves that they would not reveal had they known the content was being monitored'.

Facebook, it says, is in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.

It adds that Facebook has cloaked these activities from its users, but ‘is candid about these activities in its technical guidance for web developers’.

A Facebook spokesperson said: ‘We continue to believe the allegations in this lawsuit have no merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.’

Computer expert Graham Cluley said: ‘I don’t see anything necessarily wrong in principle with online services automatically scanning messages between individuals, and examining the links that they are sharing.

‘Indeed, if Facebook’s security team didn’t have such systems in place I would believe them to be disturbingly lax in their duty of care for users.

‘After all, if you didn’t properly scan and check links there’s a very real risk that spam, scams, phishing attacks, and malicious URLs designed to infect recipients’ computers with malware could run rife.’
