Thousands of Twitter users are expressing their solidarity with news magazine Charlie Hebdo with the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie after the attack at their offices this morning.

Journalists around the world led the trend for the hashtag, which translates as 'I am Charlie', as events following the massacre unfolded this afternoon.

By 4.15pm, nearly five hours after three gunmen stormed the building and opened fire in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, it had already been tweeted more than 250,000 times, according to one social analytics website.

The three masked attackers burst into the satirical magazine's offices at 11.30am this morning, opening fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name.

Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France – men who had regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed – including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier.

The phrase #JeSuisCharlie had become a rallying call within minutes of yesterday’s attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo.

By late afternoon it had been tweeted more than 250,000 times by people showing their unity with the satirical magazine and the victims. 

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted the hashtag and wrote in French: ‘The response to such demonic violence is love for those who suffer and virtuous action against evil’, followed by the same tweet in English.

Twitter users wrote poignant outpourings of grief alongside the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag last night.

One, Sebastien Kuntz, said: ‘To all the ordinary people around the world standing up for freedom despite terrorist threats... My heart bleeds #JeSuisCharlie.’

Another, Lara Meone Savine, wrote: ‘France stands together and the world stands with France. Your love, unity is beautiful and inspiring. I’m with you tonight.’

Showing their solidarity with the magazine, thousands of Twitter users also posted the hashtag along with the famous Voltaire misquote: ‘I do not agree with what you have to say, but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it. 

Many of the tweets included satirical cartoons, including one published in 2012 by New Yorker magazine of a blank square with the message: 'Please enjoy this culturally, ethnically, religiously and politically correct cartoon responsibly. Thank you.'

Another tweet under the hashtag by David Pope, political cartoonist at The Canberra Times in Australia, included a cartoon showed a masked gunman standing next to the corpse of a cartoonist. A speech bubble says: 'He drew first.'

Among the first to use the hashtag was Thierry Puget, who made the graphic at the top of this story, which has been widely retweeted by others expressing solidarity with the magazine.  

Others posted images of Charlie Hebdo's most famous and controversial front covers of recent years, including one of an issue supposedly guest-edited by the Prophet Muhammad promising 'a hundred lashes if you don't die laughing.'

The US embassy in France was one of those which changed its official Twitter profile, @USEmbassyFrance, to show the #JeSuisCharlie logo as its picture.

Meanwhile the French news agency AFP tweeted a photograph of its dozens of staff holding placards, and held a minute’s silence for their fellow journalists.

Google France paid tribute to the Charlie Hebdo victims by posting an image of a black ribbon below its search box, and the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag was also shared by tens of thousands of people across the image-sharing website Instagram.

A Facebook group called Je Suis Charlie was set up to inform people of vigils throughout the world – which it described as ‘good gatherings of peace-lovers’ – and had attracted more than 80,000 members within hours of forming.

Charlie Hebdo’s website crashed last night and when it returned online simply showed a black screen with the words ‘Je Suis Charlie’ in white, followed by a link to a seven-page document with ‘Je Suis Charlie’ written on each page in seven languages, including Arabic, German and Spanish.

Twitter user Jay McKinnon wrote: ‘Tonight’s crowds give me hope that France will show us that #JeSuisCharlie means more freedom, not less.’

The ‘I am…’ sentiment has become a fiercely powerful expression against injustice. The phrase ‘I am a man’ was first used during black civil rights strikes in Memphis – which had the support of Martin Luther King.

It was also used last year in Missouri, America, amid civil unrest and protest against the killing of black teenager Michael Brown when protesters chanted and wore T-shirts bearing the phrase ‘I am Michael Brown’.

By midday there were reports of up to 12 people dead and 10 wounded, four critically, including journalists, administrative staff, and police officers who attended the scene.

President Francois Hollande described the bloodbath as a 'barbaric attack against France and against journalists' and vowed to hunt down those responsible.

As well as the AK47 assault rifles, there were also reports of a rocket-propelled grenade being used in the attack, which took place during the publication's weekly editorial meeting, meaning all the journalists would have been present.

They are said to have sought out staff 'by name', according to a police source, adding that Charbonnier, known as Charb, a cartoonist responsible for an anti-Islam front page, was among those killed.

Mr Charbonnier was included in a 2013 Wanted Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam article published by Inspire, the terrorist propaganda magazine published by Al Qaeda.

Cartoonists Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski were all also reported dead.
