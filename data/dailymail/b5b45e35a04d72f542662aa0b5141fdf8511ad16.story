A young Australian jihadist in Syria may have left his old playboy lifestyle in Melbourne behind but he’s still keeping up with friends via Facebook.

Mahmoud Abdullatif fled the country four months ago, turning his back on the nightclubs, flash cars and motorbikes that he and his friends used to enjoy.

Now, instead of posing with women he poses with rifles on Twitter and Instagram.

The social media savvy jihadist’s Facebook page features his name spelled out in bullets and a photo of a dead child’s hand.

Mahmoud Abdullatif has posed with rifles on Twitter after arriving in Syria

One bloody image accuses the US and Israel of being ‘child killers’.

In August, his friend posted on old photo of them together as children, dressed up for a family wedding.

‘Remember this pic makes me laugh everytime. Hope ur safe and hope to see u soon inshallah. (""Wait for me at da gates"") love u kuzzii [sic],’ he wrote.

Another friend commented: ‘Missing you Mahmoud Abdullatif xox.’

Back in February, when he is still believed to have been living in the Melbourne suburb of Coburg, Abdullatif commented on a photo of his friends dressed in suits for a wedding.

As the men stood by a white Maserati sports car, Abdullatif wrote: ‘Thanks sis, I need a wife! Lol [sic].’

Abdullatif has only recently changed his name on Facebook and limited who can see his profile.

Before he freely posted under his real name to his 1,042 friends on the site. Even now, despite being in Syria, he is still adding new friends.

He belongs to trance night clubbing groups on Facebook and a group called ‘i wonder if i've ever aten a Mcdonalds burger that has been spat in [sic]’. 

He left his home in Melbourne for Syria four months ago and is believed to now be part of the Islamic State

His ‘likes’ include a page about Swedish girls and one that says ‘Turkish girls are gorgeous’, a page called ‘Trying to convince all 46 b**ches you talk to that you're not a player’ and ‘If She Roll A Good Blunt, Wife That B**tch.’ He’s also a fan of the sexist page ‘High heels were invented so women could put away dishes on the top shelf’. 

At some point this year, Abdullatif’s thoughts turned from women and partying in nightclubs to joining the murderous Islamic State group in Syria.

A friend told the Herald Sun that they believe he was indoctrinated via social media and that the family didn’t know about his extremist views until he got to Syria.

One post on his Facebook page shows the type of social media propaganda that he has been influenced by.

Taking aim at the 'Kuffar', the Arabic word for 'nonbelievers', one of his profile picture says: 'When you're against a group of Muslims and the Kuffar are against them too, then know that you've aligned yourself with the Kuffar against your own brothers.

'And know that if that's the case, there is definitely something wrong with your view..

'If you want to see where the most righteous of Muslims are, then look at where the arrows of the Kuffar are pointing.'

One of the pictures on his Facebook page shows his name spelled out in bullets 

His family and friends have reportedly tried to persuade him to come back but they don’t believe he is actually fighting in Syria yet.

‘He is always with little kids there. If you were fighting there would not be little kids, maybe the gun is a protection thing but everybody has guns over there,’ the friend said.

Abdullatif’s Lebanese family reportedly live near the Syrian border and have witnessed the country’s brutal civil war.

Meanwhile, his uncle by marriage is a former Operation Pendennis terror suspect who attempted to sue the Victorian Government because of the way he was allegedly treated while he was held in a maximum security jail.

Hany Taha was acquitted of a plot to blow up the MCG stadium and the Crown Casino in Melbourne after being charged with being a member of a terrorist group and attempting to make funds available to it.

He was held on remand from November 2005 to September 2008.
