The coolest invention for adventurous new mothers is here.

Parents could soon be able to take their
toddlers out on skateboarding trips with them - as a pushchair has been
invented that combines the two.

The wacky contraption consists of an elongated skateboard,
known as a longboard, which has the seat section of a child's buggy attached to
the front of it.

Children between the ages of nine months and four-and-a-half
years old can comfortably sit in the buggy while their parents can hop on the
back and propel it along.

The bizarre product dubbed the Longboardstroller has also
been enhanced with a brake at the back and handlebars for steering behind the
seat section.

It will also mean parents will be able to take their
children out on much longer 'walks' they can with a normal stroller.

The product has been created by design studio Studio Peter
Van Riet in Antwerp, Belgium, for buggy brand Quinny.

Inventors behind the Longboardstroller hope it will be an
environmentally friendly alternative to travelling in cities and that parents
will choose it over a car or bus.

Around eight prototypes of the product have been invented
and it is currently being tested and evaluated for health and safety measures.

Peter Van Riet, 42, owner of Studio Peter Van Riet, said: 'Last year we were approached by Quinny and they had an idea to make a
stroller you could stand on.

'We met with parents o talk about it and came up with
the idea of a stroller combined with a long board.

'With just a stroller alone you can travel maybe half a
mile and this offers a solution to go further without having to use a car or
another form of transport.

'It's also environmentally friendly which is one of the
main points behind it.

'To make the prototype we used part of an existing
stroller and had a longboard made out of wood and fibreglass to make it
stronger.

'It can hold children from about nine-months-old up to
four-and-a-half years, with a maximum weight of around 2st 7lbs.

'Adults stand on the back and use the handles to steer
or they can lean from side to side which also changes the direction.

'We are currently thinking about safety features such
as what kind of brake it needs, how to attach the children and board sizes.

'It is difficult to say how much it will cost as it is
not for sale yet but a good longboard costs up to £300 so it will be a bit
more than that with the extra parts.'
