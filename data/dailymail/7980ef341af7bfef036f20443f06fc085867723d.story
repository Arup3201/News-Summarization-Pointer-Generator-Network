Shia LaBeouf has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct stemming from an incident at a Broadway show in June. 

The 28-year-old actor looked forlorn as he entered court accompanied by his legal team, dressed in a sharp suit and tie but with a scruffy beard and hair.

He entered the plea on Wednesday before a Manhattan judge. If LaBeouf remains in treatment for three months and stays out of trouble for six months, he'll be able to withdraw the plea and the case will be dismissed.

Disorderly conduct is a violation, not a criminal offense. His publicist has said the episode stemmed from an alcohol problem and that the actor has since gotten treatment. 

Following his brief court appearance today, the 28-year-old was seen in jeans and a Jetsons T-shirt checking out of the Greenwich Hotel in downtown Manhattan with a backpack. 

LaBeouf was accused of disrupting a performance of Cabaret starring Alan Cumming.

On June 26, the former child actor had reportedly spent the afternoon drinking margaritas at Iguana Bar in Midtown and watching Belgium play South Korea in the World Cup.

Later that afternoon, he was seen wild-eyed and disheveled as he chased a homeless man through traffic in broad daylight around the city's Theater District, photographs show. 

It seemed the actor wanted either a bag of McDonald's food or a baseball cap that the man had. The actor repeatedly said: 'It's me, Shia', earlier reports showed.

Then, hours later, the troubled actor was led away in tears from the Studio 54 theater on West 54th Street around after causing the disturbance during the first act of Cabaret.

On Twitter, Tony nominated composer Benj Pasek wrote: 'Just saw Shia LaBeouf in handcuffs in tears surrounded by 6 police offers outside of Cabaret the musical.'

LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life? Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun.

Officers told the New York Post that LaBeouf was 'incoherent and agitated' during the arrest. One said that the actor smelled bad and told lies about having served in the military. 

Since the melee, he has been taking part in an outpatient alcohol treatment program. 

LaBeouf is best known for appearing in the first three Transformers films.

Shia LaBeouf's arrest for disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater in June is just the latest incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star.

At the end of last year, the Transformers star admitted that he had plagiarized 52-year-old cartoonist Daniel Clowes' graphic novel in a short film, HowardCantour.com, starring Jim Gaffigan.

Making a point: LaBeouf at the Berlin Film Festival in February 

Observant viewers attacked the film as an almost direct adaptation of Clowes' 2007 comic even though Shia had initially failed to give Daniel any credit.

His actions were called 'shameless theft' by the comic's publisher Eric Reynolds and a steady string of apologies from Shia ensued.

He then made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film Festival with a brown paper bag over his head.

Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'.

Early this year, LaBeouf also got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth.

And last year, the actor famously quit the production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, explaining why he pulled out of the show.

In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped.

In February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage. He then later turned up at his neighbor's door, allegedly waving a kitchen knife.
