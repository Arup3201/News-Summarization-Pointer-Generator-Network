More than half of Britain’s train commuters will soon get super-fast broadband on the move.

The Government plans to invest heavily on new mobile wi-fi equipment, promising data speeds at least ten times faster than current services.

It will be funded by a record £70 million fine to be levelled on Network Rail for delays to services. The company responsible for rail infrastructure has admitted that only 89.9 per cent of trains run on time, short of the official target of 92.5 per cent.

The wi-fi upgrade is promising internet speeds more than 10 times faster than current services

A spokesman for Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘We all know how frustrating it is to have our internet constantly disrupted on trains. At the moment it happens too often. Passengers expect and deserve better and with these plans, that is what they’ll get.

Wireless internet technology has developed in leaps and bounds in recent years, with a remarkable number of advancements connecting almost every facet of society.

In a move that adds new meaning to the term surfing the web, researchers are working on creating a 'deep-sea internet'.

A team of scientists from New York have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in Lake Erie, and are now hoping to create an industry standard for underwater communications in the world's seas and oceans.

The technology could be used to send data between submarines, for example, collect and send data from the sea floor to help detect tsunamis and other disasters sooner, as well as monitor fish and mammal numbers.
