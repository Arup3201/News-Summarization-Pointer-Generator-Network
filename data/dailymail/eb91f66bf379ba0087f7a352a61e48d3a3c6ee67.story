A young couple have caused outrage in Malaysia and Singapore by posting erotic photographs and videos of their sexual exploits on a blog.

Alvin Tan, 24, a law student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), and his girlfriend Vivian Lee, 23, have been heavily criticised in both countries for the revealing blog called 'Sumptuous Erotica'.

The blog - which also contains close-ups of the couple's genitals - has challenged the conservative values in both countries, where pornography is illegal.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Controversial: Alvin Tan, 24, and his girlfriend Vivian Lee, 23, have caused outrage in Malaysia and Singapore by posting erotic photographs and videos of their sexual exploits on a blog

Even men's magazines such as Penthouse and Playboy are banned.

In the blog, as reported by the Times of India, the couple said sex was a natural reproductive process which does not deserve the stigma attached to it.

However, by Tuesday the blog was taken down by the couple because of 'family pressure'.

In a video posted on YouTube, Lee said: 'We actually shut down the blog because of family pressure.'

Tan added: 'Yes, we will continue doing what we love doing. But it's more of a question of timing. We probably won't continue again so soon from now.'

People attempting to gain access to the blog are instead asked to give their names and email addresses if they want updates from the pair.

The blog has since become a major topic of debate in the Malaysian media.

Even senior members of the government have waded into the row.

Information Minister Rais Yatim, speaking in the Star newspaper,Â  said Malaysia has 'legal redress' under the Communications and Multimedia Act, which oversees the country's Internet content.

However, he said the government would rather not use this until seeing what the Singaporean authorities are pursuing.

The NUS confirmed today that Tan will be questioned by officials at a disciplinary hearing. Critics of the pair want him expelled from the university.

Government officials in Singapore have not commented but a number of social media sites have been inundated with calls for Tan's scholarship to be revoked.
