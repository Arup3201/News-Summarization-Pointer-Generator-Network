The seven-year-old son of former Chicago Bears player Adrian Peterson has died  eight months after being diagnosed with cancer.

AJ was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor on June 18 last year at the age of six.

His father and mother, Angela Peterson, raised nearly $40,000 for medical costs.

On Tuesday morning, former running back Peterson wrote on Facebook: '#Ajsoars is in Heaven, where he belongs... #ajsoar #P3 #MyFirstSuperHero'.

Battle: AJ was given a five per cent chance of survival when he was diagnosed with a tumor last June

The family documented AJ's journey on a GoFundMe page since his diagnosis.

He was taken to hospital on June 18 after appearing 'scatter brained' and 'imbalanced' with slurred speech.

A pediatrician referred him to hospital immediately.

Following blood tests, a CT scan, an MRI scan, and multiple tests, doctors discovered a Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma tumor embedded in his brain stem.

Surgery could be life-threatening and other treatments are largely ineffective.

AJ, who had three siblings aged five, four and 11 months, was given a five per cent chance of survival.

In January, he fulfilled his dream of becoming a police officer: he was sworn in by Round Lake Police Department in Illinois.

A memorial will be held for AJ on Saturday afternoon near the family's home in Kingsland, Georgia.
