Microsoft has unveiled its next-generation Xbox, the Xbox One - described as an 'all-in-one entertainment system for a new generation'.

The Xbox One can be completely controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures, and with the new Instant Switching feature users can ask the Xbox to 'watch TV', 'open Internet Explorer' or use it to change channels quickly without having to find the remote control. 

Microsoft's Xbox One also comes with a multi-tasking Snap Mode that lets users run more than one service at any one time, such as watch a film while checking emails on Internet Explorer.

Microsoft's Xbox One will launch in November. It has improved voice recognition and gesture controls, built-in Skype features and multi-tasking Snap Mode. Microsoft originally planned to restrict the use of second-hand games but has now backtracked

Microsoft's Xbox One came tenth in the list of general searches, beating the PlayStation 4. However, Sony's new console did come ninth in the global top 10

Microsoft's completely redesigned  Xbox Kinect sensor uses 'time of flight' and captures 2GB of data including heart rate, weight transfer and the slightest movements of joints. Under patent plans, users may soon be able to perform certain actions - that will be recorded using the Kinect sensor - while watching TV shows and earn rewards

Microsoft executives also touted the Xbox One as a replacement for the set-top box.

The new Xbox One console will be 
shipped with a completely redesigned Kinect sensor. 

Kinect is Microsoft's motion-sensing technology that lets you play games using hand gestures and body movements.

The new sensor uses 'time of flight' that records photons bouncing off your body.

Microsoft claims it can collect over 2GB of data 
per second - including your heartbeat, weight transfer, slight joint 
movements and more - and then uses this data to measure your movements and react 
to your gestures.

Xbox Live manager Marc Whitten said that voice recognition with the new Kinect sensor is 'more conversational and supports the voices of the whole family.'

Whitten also explained that the Xbox controller has similarly been redesigned with more than 40 new 
components and new D-Pad makes the controller 'more immersive.' 

Microsoft's new Xbox One console has improved voice controls that can switch TV channels, for example, and an updated Kinect sensor that can monitor users' movements. A patent applied to the US Patent and Trademark Office by Microsoft has unveiled plans to potentially use such technology to track what TV shows and adverts users watch, and then reward them with virtual points or physical products

Microsoft additionally unveiled an update to its Smart Glass technology with the new Xbox One.

Smart Glass acts as a 'second screen' that lets you currently control your Xbox 360 console with your phone or tablet.

The
 company claims it has more than 10 million downloads of the technology 
and has made it work more efficiently with the new Kinect sensor.

Elsewhere on the console, Microsoft has integrated Skype features into the operating system.

Microsoft officially bought 
video-calling software Skype in October 2011, and replaced its Windows 
Live Messenger with the software earlier this year.

With the Xbox One, users will be able to make Skype calls in widescreen HD, and start and end calls using voice controls.

Skype on Xbox One also has a group 
calls feature that lets users phone multiple people through a TV, and 
the calls can sit on the screen in Snap Mode while users use their TV to do
 other tasks, play games, watch TV and so on.

Hardware-wise, the Xbox One has a faster processor and improved graphics card, as well as a Blu-ray disc drive, USB 3.0 connections, a 500GB hard drive and 8GB system memory.

Don Mattrick, President of the 
Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft did not announce how Xbox 360 is changing but added 'exciting news' about the service will be announced at E3 in June, in Los 
Angeles.

It was confirmed, however, that Xbox Live will keep the same subscription models it currently has.

The Xbox One has a built-in TV guide that can be opened using voice controls. If a patent application submitted by Microsoft is successful, users will be able to use this guide to search for specific TV shows and series that have rewards attached. Users can then watch these shows to earn the rewards and put them towards new items for their avatars, or media downloads

Microsoft has added more servers and a dedicated DVR to Xbox One, which lets users record game and film progress, upload it to the cloud, and pick it up where they left off on another console or Windows Phone.

On the subject of games, Phil Spencer, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Studios announced that games will be 'more immersive, more personal and more connected than ever before.'

Microsoft has announced that racing simulator Forza Motorsport 5 will be available at the launch of Xbox One as part of an exclusive deal Xbox has with Forza developer Turn 10 Studios.

The release date and a trailer for the game were unveiled at Microsoft's Xbox One launch event in May by Eric Hirshberg, president and CEO of Activision, pictured, the firm that makes the game

An exclusive TV show based on the Microsoft's Halo franchise was announced by Steven Spielberg at the Xbox One event in Washington

Other exclusive deals 
with popular franchises include a TV series based on the sci-fi shooter 
Halo, and the event was wrapped up with a world premiere of Call of 
Duty: Ghosts which is also launching exclusively on Xbox One.

Plus,
 within the first year of Xbox One, Microsoft Studios plan to announce 
15 new exclusive games, including eight brand-new franchises. 

Before tonight's event, rumours were 
circulating that Microsoft would announce plans to launch its 
IllumiRoom technology with the Xbox One.

Microsoft Research Project released a video of the technology in January.

However, there was no mention of the 'real-life holodeck' technology that projects images and lights from whatever game or film you're watching 
around your living room.

It's now likely Microsoft will announce its plans for this technology at this 
year's E3 conference In Los Angeles, in June.

The Xbox One controller has more than 40 new components and has a better-fitting battery. It has been developed using feedback from gamers. The D-pad has also been tweaked to make the controller 'more immersive

Tom Parsons, Reviews Editor, Stuff, gave MailOnline his first impressions:

'The Xbox One is clearly designed to blend into the lounge rather than stick out, so it’s not the most exciting looking device.

It looks as though the Xbox One will perform very similarly to Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4 although rumour has it the Xbox One has slightly slower type of memory, which could prove to be a disadvantage.

The way you interact with the consoles seems to be the big difference, though – the new Kinect’s advanced voice and gesture control should make it a very hands-off experience. If it works as well as Microsoft says it does.

Because the Xbox One integrates all of your TV and web content, and can be controlled entirely through voice and gestures, it should appeal to plenty of non-gamers – as long as it doesn’t cost too much.

I’m a little disappointed by the physical design and dimensions, especially of the Kinect camera, and I’m concerned that it might not be powerful enough for ultra high definition 4K graphics.

One thing’s for sure – the battle between Sony and Microsoft looks like it’s going to be more fierce than ever when Xbox One and PS4 launch.

Meanwhile, Microsoft confirmed tonight that the Xbox One will allow second-hand games to be played - for a small fee.

A company spokesman said Microsoft was 'designing Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games'.

This announcement follows concerns raised that single-code activations would effectively lock games to one of the new consoles.

The new Xbox One is expected to launch 'later this year' and BlockBuster has already opened up pre-orders for the device with a £20 deposit.

Ahead of tonight's event, Microsoft announced a new interactive TV show that will only be available Xbox Gold subscribers. The show, called 'The Music Room' starts on 29 May at 8.30pm.

Microsoft will be looking to take aim at Nintendo, as well as Sony, with the launch of its new Xbox One.

Sony was first to showcase plans for its upcoming PlayStation 4 - but not the actual box - at an event in New York last February.

The reaction to that console, which featured richer graphics and more social features, was mixed.

A new trailer for the PlayStation 4 was released yesterday ahead of today's Microsoft announcement.

Many of the Microsoft Xbox One specifications are said to be similar to those expected with the PlayStation 4.
