When a British rock star ‘married’ her Texan heiress girlfriend, the two women wanted their big day to be unforgettable – and spent more than £100,000 to make sure.

Deborah Dyer, better known as Skunk Anansie lead singer Skin, and billionaire’s daughter Christiana Wyly held a lavish civil partnership ceremony near Verona in Italy.

Guests quaffed cocktails at the historic Villa Di Campo hotel, danced to an orchestra and feasted on £25,000-worth of fine cuisine. Up to £10,000 was splashed out on flowers and cocktails alone.

However, the couple now claim their day was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, after being left with a string of unexpected bills.

In the weeks after the  wedding, they received demands totalling £62,000 from the caterers,  musicians, florists and a  children’s entertainer.

The singer and the heiress say they had paid a wedding planning firm a one-off fee which was supposed to cover all the costs for the day.

They are now suing the women-only ‘lifestyle management’ firm Besos Concierge, of Hampton, Middlesex, for £100,000, saying they paid an all-inclusive fee for it to plan the event and cover the costs of the ceremony and party.

Claiming their memories of the happiest day of their lives have been tainted, the couple have issued a High Court writ against Besos and its boss Michelle Candice David, 28, demanding their money back.

It is understood the firm and Miss David, of Hounslow, west London, will contest the claim.

Skunk Anansie formed in 1994, broke up in 2001 and reformed in 2009. Their hits include You’re Too Expensive for Me, We Love Your Apathy and Good Things Don’t Always Come To You.

On her website, 45-year-old Miss Dyer writes about herself saying: ‘A bit of anger can be very useful in the right place and time, it gives you sparks, gets you moving, feeds your passion, separates the girls from the toys!’

Couple: Skin is a DJ and model, but best known as the lead singer of Skunk Anansie while her partner Christina Wyly is an environmental advocate

Miss Wyly – described by her partner 
as ‘my gorgeous wifey’ – is the daughter of Sam Wyly, one of the 1,000 
wealthiest people on the planet. An environmental campaigner, she boasts
 on her website how she successfully badgered her father to divert some 
of his fortune to green causes.

The 78-year-old Texan billionaire, a 
close friend of George W Bush, made his millions through a string of 
capital ventures in computing, the financial sector and a steakhouse 
empire.

According to the High Court writ, Miss Dyer and Miss Wyly, who 
live in a £1.6million farmhouse near Petersfield, Hampshire, enjoyed a 
three-day celebration last August at the Verona home of a family friend.

But about a month later ‘several of the wedding suppliers began to 
contact the couple requesting payment’, said the couple’s barrister, 
Abra Bompas.

By February, nine suppliers including 
the orchestra had been in touch demanding their fees, she added. She 
alleged that the wedding planning company had initially admitted in an 
email that it was ‘liable for these outstanding payments’ and ‘would 
arrange for all the suppliers to be paid in full’.

Apart from the £62,000, the couple are
 also claiming £30,000 they say they were required to pay Besos – which 
means ‘kisses’ in Spanish – as a ‘membership fee’, plus £8,687 they 
allege they paid the company, and a further £15,423 of their cash they 
say it still holds.

Besos and Miss David’s defence to the 
action was not available from the court, and the claims in the writ have
 yet to be tested in evidence before a judge.

But the company is believed to be 
accusing the celebrity couple of failing ‘to provide sufficient sums’ to
 cover the costs of their wedding, a claim they deny.

Through its solicitors, the  company denied any obligation to make any outstanding payments  to suppliers.
