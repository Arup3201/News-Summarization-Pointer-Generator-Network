A driver from Minnesota has been hailed a hero after using 'superhuman strength' to rip open the door of car that was on fire, saving the man inside.

Bob Renning had been driving along the interstate in New Brighton on Sunday when he saw a SUV behind him burst into flames.

When the 52-year-old rushed over to the vehicle, which was filling with smoke, he saw its driver Michael Johannes trapped inside.

The fire had knocked out the SUV's electrics system, causing the windows and doors to lock.

Renning said when he tried the door and looked inside the vehicle he could see Johannes frantically pounding on the window.

Despite not being fit, Renning somehow managed to prise the door open by gripping the top of the frame and bracing his foot against it.

The door bent in half and the window shattered, leaving enough space for Johannes to crawl to safety.

State trooper Zachary Hill said Renning, who is in the Air National Guard, had used 'superhuman strength' in the rescue.

'I don't think I could take a crowbar and fold the door like he did,' Hill said.

Renning was also shocked by his own strength, and told the Star Tribune: 'I'm still not exactly sure how I did it.'

He added: 'Iâ€™m just a slightly overweight Air Force First Sergeant, for crying out loud.'

Johannes has also praised his rescuer, saying that just moments before he had been certain he was facing death.

'Thirty seconds later and I would have been done,' Johannes, who was treated for a cut to his head and smoke inhalation, said.
