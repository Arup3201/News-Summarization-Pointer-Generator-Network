The festive season is generally considered to be one of the busiest and most stressful times of the year.

Finding time to buy presents, cooking a Christmas dinner for the whole family and the nagging worries about how much the whole lot costs can leave some with their fair share of anxiety at this time of year.

But despite the tiredness, family tensions and financial pressure, nearly half of men think women exaggerate the stressfulness of Christmas, according to a new study.

A third of men think they could do a better job of organising Christmas than their partner

But 42 per cent of women say hosting Christmas Day is their most stressful job of the year, while 85 per cent say men don't understand how much work it takes

What's more, an antagonistic third of men reckon they could do a better job than their partner if they were in charge of the festive preparations.

But, four in ten British women would not trust their other half to execute essential Christmas tasks, whereas they'd get it done right first time.

And a staggering 85 per cent of women claim men don't understand how much work goes into creating the perfect Christmas, nor the stress it causes.

The study showed, though, that 42 per cent of women said that hosting Christmas Day is their most stressful job of the year.

A further two in five women worry their hosting skills on Christmas Day will be criticised by family and friends.

The study into stress at Christmas revealed that keeping guests entertained, planning meals, and getting embarrassed by a partner or child are the biggest worries.

Stress can come from all sorts of sources at this time of year, including braving the crowds searching for those last minute presents

The research, by hotel chain Travelodge, found the week leading up to Christmas to be the worst for sleep throughout the year.

Psychologist Corinne Sweet said: 'The stress of Christmas can be avoided if people lower their expectations of it.

'I would suggest taking time out from a busy schedule while having a nap can do wonders if you've not had much sleep.

'People will also benefit from having some quiet 'me-time' every once in a while.'

Financial worries can also come to the fore at this time of year as people bid to show their loved ones how much they care

Nearly half of Brits will miss 21 hours of sleep this week in the lead up to Christmas Day, according to a new study.

As we stay up late to wrap gifts and attend festive parties, 45 per cent of us will have to live on just five hours shut-eye each day, while the recommended average is eight.

Christmas stress means four in ten sleep-deprived adults will also get up an hour early each day this week to complete festive preparations.

Dr Chris Idzikowski, of The Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said: 'It is important that Brits try to keep a regular sleep pattern in the lead up to Christmas.'Sleepiness is as dangerous as drinking and people have to be very careful if they're driving or doing anything else that requires full attention.'Â
