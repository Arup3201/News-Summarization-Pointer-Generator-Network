Conor McGregor has played down fears over the scratch on his nose ahead of his fight with Dennis Siver.

The Irish featherweight is one win away from a world title shot against champion Jose Aldo but was pictured with the cut during his preparations.

McGregor was quick to reassure fans it will not affect him in Boston on Sunday night, however.

'It's just a graze from a velcro strap during my final spar last week, he told Sportsmail.

'The cold out here has made it dry up; it looks worse than it is.'

McGregor, who signed a deal with Reebok on Wednesday, also reacted to comments from a Dublin senator that the sport of mixed martial arts is 'vile'.

McGregor hopes his clash with Aldo will take place in front of 80,000 fans at Croke Park later this year.

But Catherine Noone revealed she had asked for the sport to not to be licensed, although she later backtracked.

And McGregor said: 'It is an educational process for some people to learn about the safety in the sport.

'The facts show that this a safe sport; we go through rigorous testing before we get in the Octagon.

'You will always get critics and people won't always be on board but the facts speak for themselves.

'I am on my journey and focused on my training but I must have a responsibility to teach these people.

I am introducing these people to a new way of fighting so I'm introducing them to the health and safety too, I suppose.'
