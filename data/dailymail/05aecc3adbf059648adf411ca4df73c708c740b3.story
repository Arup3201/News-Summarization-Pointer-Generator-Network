US President Barack Obama said the growing crisis in Iraq threatens America but rejects the idea of sending troops to fight militant organizations 'wherever they pop up'.

Obama said his administration would not fall into the trap of 'whack-a-mole' foreign policy when a global, targeted response was needed to counter extremists.

I think it's important for us to 
recognize that ISIS is just one of a number of organizations that we 
have to stay focused on,' Obama told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell.

'This
 is going to be a global challenge and one that the United States is 
going to have to address but we're not going to be able to address it 
alone.'

Concerned: US President Barack Obama told 'CBS This Morning' journalist Norah O'Donnell (right) that Sunni militants which have taken over parts of northern Iraq pose a 'medium- and long-term threat' to America because of their extreme ideology

He added: 'And as I said yesterday, what we can't do is think that we're 
just going to play whack-a-mole and send US troops occupying various 
countries wherever these organizations pop up.

'We're going to have to have a more focused, more targeted strategy and 
we're going to have to partner and train local law enforcement and 
military to do their jobs as well.'

He said Sunni
 militants that have seized Iraqi towns pose a 'medium- 
and long-term threat' to the US because of their extreme ideology, but expects that the local populations would 
reject ISIS because of their violence.Â 

Meanwhile U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is 
discouraging Arab nations from sending financial support to even 
moderate opposition Sunni groups in Syria, fearing the aid could be used to help the growing insurgency in Iraq.

Kerry says he delivered that message to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi during their meeting Sunday in Cairo.

He says he plans to make the same case to other leaders in Sunni-dominated Arab states over the next several days, as the region's security is facing a critical moment as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant gains ground in Iraq.

The group has taken over parts of Syria in what is rapidly deteriorating into a cross-border war. He'll urge Arab states to work together to defeat the group.

The news comes as rebel fighters from
 Islamic militant group ISIS have captured four more towns in Iraq 
including a crossing on the border with Syria.

Qaim,
 Rawah and Anah all fell to rebels fighters yesterday, while civilians 
in the town of Rutba are negotiating a surrender after units stationed 
on the outskirts threatened to start shelling.

The
 towns, the first to fall in the mainly Sunni province of Anbar, were 
captured as Shiite volunteer soldiers marched through Baghdad as the 
country heads towards sectarian war.

The
 capture of Rawah, situated on the Euphrates River, and the nearby 
settlement of Anah, also raises the prospect that ISIS militants are 
marching towards a dam at Haditha.

Unrest: Mehdi Army fighters loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr joined in the marches which also took place in the southern cities of Basra and Amarah on June 21

Defense: Kurdish Peshmerga troops secure an area in the town of Sulaiman Pek in Salahuddin province on June 21, as Sunni fighters seize a border post on the Iraq-Syria frontier

If the dam and adjoining power station were destroyed, it would cripple the country's power grid and cause widespread flooding.

Iraqi military officials said more than 2,000 troops were quickly dispatched to the site of the dam to protect it against a possible attack by the Sunni militants.

Rawah's mayor, Hussein Ali al-Aujail,
 said the militants ransacked the town's government offices and forced 
local army and police forces to pull out.

Rawah and Anah had remained under government control since nearby Fallujah fell to the Sunni militants in January.

The
 capture of a border crossing at Qaim has allowed ISIS to move heavy 
artillery and vehicles from Syria with ease for use on Iraqi 
battlefields. Troops have long been able to cross unimpeded.

Syrian rebels have already seized the facilities on the Syrian side of the border and several other posts in areas under their control.

Police and the army said the Sunni insurgents seized Qaim and its crossing, about 200 miles west of Baghdad, after killing about 30 Iraqi troops in day-long clashes on Friday.

The officials said people were now crossing back and forth freely.

Chief military spokesman Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi acknowledged Qaim's fall, saying troops aided by local tribesmen sought to clear the city of 'terrorists'.
