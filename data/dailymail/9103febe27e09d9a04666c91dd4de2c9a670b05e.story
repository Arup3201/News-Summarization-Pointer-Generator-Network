Controversial: Women's rights groups have called for Secretary for Security Lai Tung-Kwok to retract his statement

Hong Kong's security minister has been criticised for saying women should 'not drink too much' if they want to avoid being raped. 

The remarks were made by Secretary for Security Lai Tung-Kwok who was presenting figures on crime in the city which showed rape cases had risen by 60 per cent.

'All of these (rape) cases happened between those who know each other.

'They are either friends, close friends or they just met a few hours ago,' Lai said on Tuesday. 

'Some of these cases also involved the victims being raped after drinking quite a lot of alcohol.

'So I would appeal that young ladies should not drink too much', he added. 

But the comment resulted in people taking to social networking sites including Facebook and Twitter to express their anger.

Campaigners for women's rights called for Lai to retract his statement and instead concentrate on arresting attackers. 

Linda Wong, executive director of Hong Kong's Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women, said the remarks were a step backwards.

She told AFP: 'The under-reporting of rape in Hong Kong is already very high and some of the reason is women feel that people will put all the blame on them'. 

A government spokesman said Lai had no intention to blame the victims.

According to the latest figures, the number of rapes in the first quarter of the year had risen by 13 to 35.
