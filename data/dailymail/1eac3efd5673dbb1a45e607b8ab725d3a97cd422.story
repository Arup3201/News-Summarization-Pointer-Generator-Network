Two callous thieves were caught on camera using homemade scoops to dip into into a wishing well filled with donations meant for sick children with cancer.

The heartless pair targeted the wishing well at the Wookey Hole tourist spot in Somerset, which each year collects thousands for charity Children with Leukaemia.

It is not known exactly how much they got away with, but Chris Goodchild, the owner of the popular attraction, is now offering a £500 reward to catch the thieves.

'It's just the lowest of the low,' he said. 'Stealing from charity. It's sick. You don't get any lower than that.' 

CCTV - installed after staff at Wookey Hole noticed there wasn't as much money as usual in the wishing well - captured the two stealing coins meant for children with cancer

The duo were captured on CCTV after staff noticed there weren't as many coins in the well as usual last November. 

They soon caught the thieves in the act, watching them fishing into the disused well to get the change.

But the pair got wise to being watched, and stole the camera from the wall. 

Mr Goodchild said: 'We noticed the difference in money and put up the cameras and less than a month later we saw them taking the money.

'Because it's a charity thing we don't know how much is in there until they come to collect it. I'd say there was a few hundred pounds that has gone missing though.

'Over the years we've raised several thousand pounds for charity, it's been here eight years and we've never had a problem with it before.'

Wookey Hole's wishing well raises thousands for Children with Leukemia every year - and its owner is offering £500 to catch the thieves

It is thought a few hundred pounds have been taken from the fund.

He added: 'They've used tools with scoops on the end, they must be quite long as it is about 4 foot deep. 

Avon and Somerset police are asking anyone with any information to call 101, quoting reference: 10756/15.
