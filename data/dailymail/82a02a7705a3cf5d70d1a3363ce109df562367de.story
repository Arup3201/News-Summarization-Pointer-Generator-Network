Italy may have sealed England's World Cup fate by failing to beat Costa Rica on Thursday, but we can't say that Mario Balotelli and Co weren't chasing the game after they were caught offside an incredible 11 times.

The last time that many offsides was recorded in a World Cup game was at the 2006 tournament and came from Italy again... twice! The Azzurri managed to rack up 11 offsides against USA in the group stages and Germany in the semi-finals before eventually winning the tournament.

There have been 12 occasions of a side getting more than 11
offsides in a World cup game since 1966, with Englandâ€™s 20 against Kuwait in 1982 the
most.

Not again! Italy were caught offside 11 times in their 1-0 defeat to Costa Rica at the World Cup

The Spain '82 tournament will be best remembered by England supporters for Bryan Robson's goal against France after 27 seconds - the fourth fastest in World Cup history. However, it was the group game against Kuwait that brought England their unwanted record.

Trevor Francis scored the only goal in the 1-0 victory at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao, but it is  the twenty offside calls that has remained a talking point - that's approximately one every five minutes.

Serial offenders! Italy twice racked up 11 offsides in a game on their way to winning the 2006 World Cup

England had already secured qualification as group winners while Kuwait had come into the game after one of the most controversial events in World Cup history when they stopped playing to concede a goal against France after hearing what they thought was the referee's whistle.

Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and 
president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch and remonstrated until the Soviet referee disallowed the goal - only for the French to score minutes later and win the game 4-1.

Deadlock broken: Trevor Francis scored the only goal of the game, but was guilty of missing more chances

Kuwait became the first Asian team to ever face England and put in a decent performance albeit against opposition who had nothing to play for.

England were generally in control throughout the game but were guilty of a succession of missed opportunities before Francis and Paul Mariner combined to break the deadlock. The same two players had the best chances thereafter but looked more interested in conserving energy for the more challenging tests ahead.

Having topped the group with victories over France, Czechoslovakia and Kuwait, England eventually bowed out in the next round after goalless draws with West Germany and Spain - where Kevin Keegam largely blamed for missing several chances, despite nursing niggling injuries.
