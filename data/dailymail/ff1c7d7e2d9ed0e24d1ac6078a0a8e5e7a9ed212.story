Wojciech Szczesny is excited about the competition for Arsenal's No 1 jersey this season after the club signed David Ospina from Nice.

Ospina moved to the Emirates in July after shining for Colombia as they reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil.

Szczesny says that after Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea when his contract expired it was inevitable that Arsene Wenger would strengthen in that position during the current transfer window.

Relishing the competition: Arsenal's number one in action during training ahead of the new season

Battle to be number one: Szczesny has said the arrival of David Ospina has not faze him in the slightest

'I love a challenge,' the Polish shot-stopper told Arsenal.com.

'I was expecting someone to come because Lukasz has left for Swansea and I wish him all the best. I knew someone would come in. I'm just going to do the same thing over again, I'm going to try my best in every game and every week in training. Hopefully that will be enough.'

Szczesny, who played in Sunday's Emirates Cup defeat to Monaco, thinks the first-team squad are reaching the right level of fitness ahead of the new Premier League campaign.

'It would have been nice to win a cup that we play at home, but that's not what we talk about in pre-season,' he said. 'We want to prepare and make sure we are at our very best at the weekend [in the Community Shield] and then against Crystal Palace in [the Premier League].

'Last year we had a long pre-season and we played a lot of games in Asia. This year is completely different but I think everyone is looking sharper every single day.'

Safe hands: The 25-year-old put in some fine performances for Jose Pekerman's side during the tournament

The 24-year-old is confident that by signing the likes of Ospina, Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy, the club can push on from their performances last season, during which they won the FA Cup, their first trophy in nine years.

'We were close to being right near the top last year in the Premier League and we managed to win the FA Cup. This year we added some players and we're looking stronger. The confidence is flying high and hopefully this year we can challenge for the Premier League.'
