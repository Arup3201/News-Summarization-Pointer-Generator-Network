It stands just a few paces from a glorious, sandy beach and boasts a veranda from which you can watch the sun set over one of Britain’s most picturesque seaside towns.

Little wonder if the Edwardian charm of Compass House proves irresistible to anyone browsing holiday brochures and internet sites for an Easter break this year.

But if they want to take the family, they’d be advised to check their dates.

Costly view: The price of renting Compass House in St Ives rises from £889 to £2,899 during the school holidays

For the price of renting this otherwise modest retreat in St Ives, Cornwall, more than trebles during the week in which thousands of families head off with the kids on their school holidays.

Booking Compass House for the week ending Saturday March 23 costs £889.

A few hours after they close the doors and prepare it for the next arrivals, however, the price rises instantly to a £2,899.

The huge rise applies all through the Easter school holidays before jumping again to a staggering £4,499 for the peak weeks of July and August.

Only out-of-season periods see rates fall – to a special-offer £670, if you happen to have booked it for a week beginning from today.

The changing rates for the wooden ‘seaside villa’ show how the average family can struggle to find a reasonably priced break during school holidays.

Record numbers of parents are taking their children out of school in term time to avoid tourist industry exploitation, according to teachers’ unions.

Just as well, as Compass House has no on-site parking. It has a modern fitted kitchen and sleeps six but has only one bathroom.

Yesterday no one had made a booking for any dates during the school Easter holiday period, but five weeks in the premium-price summer had already been booked.

Fluctuation: Despite the huge prices charged during peak season, Compass House sees rates fall to £670 if booked for weeks out-of-season

Agents Cornish Gems, a holiday company which also rents other houses with prices from £200 to nearly £6,500, said: ‘It’s probably one of the only properties we’ve got where the price does actually vary quite dramatically from low to high season.’

Founder and co-director Julianne Shelton added: ‘It’s in such high demand in the summer, it’s really because of that.

'Over and above this factor, the prices diversify so much due to its prime location – there isn’t another property like it in the area. Guests absolutely love it.’
