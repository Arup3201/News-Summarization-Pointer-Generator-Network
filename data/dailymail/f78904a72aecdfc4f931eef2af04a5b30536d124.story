When Sara Price-Parker's mother made the heartbreaking decision to have her adopted, she hoped she would be giving her daughter a childhood free from pain and suffering.

But Denise Sanderson - who was 23 and single when she became pregnant - could not have known that her daughter's beloved adoptive mother, Brenda, would be struck down by cancer while Sara was still a child.

Aged just nine, the little girl had to watch as Brenda's health deteriorated, and she died when Sara was only 16.

Reunited after 44 years: Sara Price-Parker and her mother, Denise Sanderson, who had her adopted as a baby in the hope it would give her a  better life

Now 44, Sara, from South Wirral, said it was terrible seeing her mother in pain. 'I couldn't
 cope with it at all,' she said.

'She got so sick I would avoid coming home. I 
couldn't handle seeing someone I loved so much so ill.

'When she died the backbone of the family was gone - the laughter and 
the spark. I felt cheated. Cheated that I didn't have a mum anymore.'

Sara always knew she had been adopted by Brenda and her husband, David. They said she made their family complete as she became a sibling for their son, John.

Heartbroken at losing Brenda, two years later she decided to seek out her biological parent, Denise.

She recalls: 'Although
 I felt the betrayal towards my adoptive mum, the questions I wanted 
answering wouldn't go away. I wanted to know what her life was like, 
what happened to her?'

Through her research, Sara discovered that Denise had also had a sad childhood, losing her own mother when she was just seven.

Holding her baby again: Denise said giving her daughter away was the hardest thing she's ever had to do

Sara explained: 'She lost a parent at an early age and I 
did. The paperwork said she wanted me to grow up in a normal family with
 two parents which she never had, it must have been a horrendous 
and heartbreaking decision to make.'

Via the adoption paperwork, Sara was able to find out the address where Denise had lived when she was 23 but she had long moved on. Sara wrote to the neighbours and they recollected her living at the home but believed she had emigrated to Jamaica. This brought Sara's search to a dead end.

She went on to marry her husband, Mike, and they have a son, Joel, 12.

Sara said being a mother made her realise how much she missed her own mum.

She said: 'I adore being a mum. It's this little person walking around who's a piece of 
you. But I haven't had a mum for so long, I can't remember what it must 
be like to have a mum.'

Decades on from when she first started searching and still desperate to see if she could find her biological mother, she enlisted the help of ITV show Long Lost Family.

She said on the show: 'I feel cheated, I've lost two mums. there's a huge gap in my life. I need to find her.'

The programme researchers discovered Denise had married a man called Alfred Sanderson (nicknamed Sandy) in Blackpool a few months after Sara was born and they had eventually settled in Oregon.

The show's presenter Nicky Campbell flew across the Atlantic to hear Denise's story and find out if she would be willing to be reunited with her long lost daughter.

Retired Denise, now 67, said knowing Sara was searching for her was a dream come true.

She explained how giving her daughter up had been the worst day of her life. She told of how Sara was conceived and how she thought giving her away would mean she would have a better life.

Happy ending: Long Lost Family presenters Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell helped mother and daughter find one another again after Denise had emigrated to the U.S

'When I was 17 I came to live in Blackpool with my sister, that's where I met Sara's father. We went out for three years and got engaged but it was a stormy relationship. When I found out I was pregnant I realised it wouldn't be good and finished with him,' she explained.

'I thought the best thing for Sarah was for her to be adopted. She was put into a foster home for six weeks and I went to see her every weekend with Sandy, who I had met when I was seven months pregnant.'

Denise sad she didn't consider keeping Sara and raising her with Sandy as they 'had only been going out for a couple of months so I didn't know what was going to happen.'

She hoped by giving Sara away, she could guarantee she would have a happy childhood. But she said saying goodbye to her baby was the hardest thing she'd ever had to do.

She recalled through tears: 'When you go to the adoption agency, straight away the baby is taken off you. You go to another room to do the paperwork and that's it, you never see your a baby again. That was really hard.'

She added: 'I just wanted her to have the best as I had a messy childhood, I didn't want there to be any chance of her having a bad childhood.'

Denise took comfort from a letter Brenda and David sent her after they adopted Sara in which they wrote of their love for the baby and gratitude to Denise. They said they would tell her of Denise when she was old enough to understand.

Brenda and David were loving parents and they were able to give Sara the idyllic and stable childhood Denise had desired for her.

But she was devastated to hear that Sara's happiness was cut short when Brenda was diagnosed with cancer.

Success: The presenters made it possible for Denise and Sara to meet again in Blackpool in tear-jerking scenes in Monday's show

Sara said despite the trauma, she has no regrets about her upbringing and is glad she was able to be raised by Brenda and David.

She told the show's other presenter, Davina McCall, of Denise's decision to give her away: 'She did the right thing, I have had such a nice life. She couldn't foresee what would happen. I wouldn't change anything.'

Sara said she was delighted she had a 'second chance' at being a daughter again after Denise had been tracked down and agreed to come back to England to meet her.

'Wouldn't it be lovely to have someone to confide in and to phone up, to have a grandmother for Joel,' she said wistfully.

On hearing this, Denise said: 'I'm honoured she thinks I can fill the gap in her life left by her adoptive mother.'
