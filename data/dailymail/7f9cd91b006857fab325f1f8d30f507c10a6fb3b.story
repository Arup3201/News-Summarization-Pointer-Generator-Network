Confrontation: Michael Schmidt was shot by police after barricading himself in an apartment lobby

An assortment of drugs and other unidentified substances were found inside the apartment of the Dallas attorney who was killed in a shootout with police last Thursday.

Authorities say they found a ‘green leafy substance’, a ‘white powdery substance’ and various types of pills in Michael Edward Schmidt’s safe.

Police also found a ‘penis shaped’ marijuana pipe and 10 driver’s licenses in the safe, along with white and yellow pills in clear plastic baggies.

They discovered 'white, yellow, orange, blue or brown pills' in a bottle labeled Alprazolam, an anti-anxiety medication that had been prescribed to him, according to court documents released by Dallas News.

Authorities also found 54 hydrocodone pills in a clear plastic sandwich baggie, the records state.

They did not find evidence that Schmidt had a prescription for those pills.

An unidentified white powdery substance is being tested which was found inside capsules.

The Dallas lawyer, 47, was shot dead by police on Thursday after he reported a burglary at his home and then barricaded himself in the apartment complex lobby.

Police claim Schmidt started to fire at them when they responded to calls of a break in at about 1.45am on Thursday.

Marriage woes: Schmidt's 20-year marriage to his high school sweetheart had recently ended. The couple had four children together

Schmidt, whose 20-year marriage had recently ended, was shot as he approached police during the confrontation.

No
 one else was injured in the shootout, but Schmidt's 11-year-old 
daughter was in his Glass House by Windsor apartment at the time.

The shooting took place in the building's lobby and resulted in the windows being shattered by gunfire.

The incident began when Schmidt allegedly told an employee in the complex that his apartment was being broken into.

But
 when police arrived, the father-of-four is said to have barricaded 
himself in the main lobby, where witnesses claim he fired several shots.

Officers told Dallas News they tried to negotiate with Schmidt but when he continued to shoot at them, they fired back.

Schmidt, who represented clients in medical negligence cases at his father's law firm, had recently separated from his wife.

The couple had started dating when they were teenagers and had four children together.

He
 was a leading lawyer, having been voted Super Lawyer seven years in a 
row and was listed as one of the 500 Leading Lawyers of America.
