Open champion Rory McIlory has apologised for being unable to show off his prized Claret Jug to Northern Ireland’s political leaders today, because 'it needed a good clean' after his big night out celebrating.

The three-time Major winner met with Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness at Stormont Castle in Belfast.

But the newly crowned Open winner was empty handed, having left the jug - which last night took pride of place on the table of a Belfast nightclub - at home to soak.

He said: 'I am sorry I don’t have the Claret Jug, it’s not going everywhere with me. It actually needs a bit of a clean after last night.

'It’s an amazing trophy and something that I am obviously very proud of and hopefully there are many more to come.'

McIlroy first visited Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness three years ago in the wake of his first Major win - the 2011 US Open.

'I am obviously very, very proud and honoured to come back home and come home as an Open champion and to be congratulated by everyone,' said McIlroy.

'I am very proud to be from Northern Ireland, I am very proud of where I come from and I will never lose touch of that, and I will never lose sight of that - I will never forget where I come from.

'To be able to share these sort of moments with people from back home and close friends and family, it’s absolutely wonderful.'

Mr Robinson said he hoped McIlroy could complete the Grand Slam of Major wins with victory at the US Masters at Augusta, Georgia next April.

'We are really proud of him,' said the Democratic Unionist leader.

Apology: He told them: 'I am sorry I don't have the Claret Jug, it's not going everywhere with me. It actually needs a bit of a clean after last night'

'Not only in terms of the achievements of a fantastic golfing career and the competitions he’s won but he is a tremendous ambassador for Northern Ireland.

'He gives the kind of messages about Northern Ireland that we want people to hear - a good news story relating to Northern Ireland.

'And apart from all of that he’s a thoroughly decent fella.'

Mr McGuinness said the Open represented 'undoubtedly the greatest prize in world golf'.

Party: The jug night took pride of place on the table of a nightclub as McIlroy and his family and friends celebrated

Historic: McIlroy joined the elite list of golfers to have won three of the four major titles at Hoylake on Sunday

'It’s been absolutely a huge buzz for all of us,' said the Sinn Fein veteran.

'We are living in a world now where there’s an awful lot of sadness in different parts of the world and this just brings so much happiness and joy to all of the people here that one of our own is seen to be one of the greatest golfers in the world today. No mean achievement by the age of 25 and coming from Holywood in Co Down.'

When Mr McGuinness speculated that McIlroy could go on to achieve success on the fairways for 25 or even 40 more years, the young golfer interrupted.

'You should have stopped at 25,' he joked.
