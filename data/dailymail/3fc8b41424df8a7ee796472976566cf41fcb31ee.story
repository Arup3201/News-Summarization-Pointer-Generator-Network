Wellesley College has revised its admissions policy to formally allow transgender students who identify as female.

The women's-only liberal arts school in Massachusetts - which costs roughly $59,000 per year to attend - never explicitly banned transgender applicants.

However, it said in a statement on its website Thursday that it felt compelled to clarify its policies 'in an era of a changing understanding of gender identity.'

The college’s board of trustees approved the new policy on Wednesday night.

Under the new guidelines, Wellesley College says it will consider for admission any applicant who 'lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman.'

It adds that if gender identity is not 'clearly reflected' in application materials, the college will request additional information 'that may include a letter from a parent, healthcare provider, teacher, or clergy.'

The updated code will come into effect in time for the next admission cycle for the Class of 2020.

The move follows similar policy changes at all-women's colleges such as Mills College in California, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and Mount Holyoke and Simmons College, both in Massachusetts.

Wellesley said it will not accept applications from transgender men, but would 'continue to support' any student who decides she no longer identifies as a woman during her education there.

Wellesley, which was founded with the intention to prepare women for 'great conflicts' and 'vast reforms in social life' first opened its doors to students on September 8, 1875.

Prominent graduates include former First Lady Hillary Clinton and ABC news anchor Diane Sawyer.
