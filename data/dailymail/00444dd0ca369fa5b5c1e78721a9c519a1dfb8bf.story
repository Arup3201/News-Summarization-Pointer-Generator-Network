Jobless people are being offered a course on how to 'design your own tattoo' - paid for by taxpayers.

The free sessions on tattoo art paid for by the Labour-run Welsh Government's anti-poverty programme was yesterday blasted as a 'waste of public money'.

The skin ink sessions for the unemployed are described a 'free fun interactive course that will develop your artistic skills to be able to design tattoos for yourself and others'.

The six-hour course is being run at a series of venues around Bridgend, South Wales, as part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help people get back to work.

But leading Lib-Dem Welsh Assembly member Peter Black hit out at the tattoo courses - and said it shows the job-creation scheme is a flop.

He said: 'It is difficult to see how this venture can be justified.

'This important regeneration programme is not delivering what is expected of it and now we see it being reduced to fun tattoo design classes.'

The Labour Welsh Government has spent around more than Â£200million on the Communities First scheme over the last ten years - but did not disclose how much is spent on the tattoo course.

Mr Black said: 'Tens of millions of pounds have been spent on Communities First over the last decade or so but what indicators that are available show that in employment, health and education terms this money has had little impact.

'The Government needs to revisit how they are spending this money so as to deliver the results we need in helping deprived communities back to work.'

The tattoo sessions are being held for free at community centres in Caerau, Cornelly and Sarn areas of Bridgend later this month.

It is aimed to 'support people to acquire the appropriate skills to become job-ready and gain sustainable employment.'

A spokesman for Communities and Tackling Poverty Minister Jeff Cuthbert hit back by dubbing the attack as 'snobbish and grossly misleading'.

He said: 'The Work Programme publicises the fact that it has found work for young people in this growing industry - is Mr Black complaining about these jobs?'

'The truth is he has seen one advert about one small project in one Communities First area and run to the press without first making proper enquiries about the facts of the matter.'

A spokesman for Bridgend council said: 'The "Design your own tattoo" session should not be taken at face value.

'It is carefully structured to help people develop confidence and important skills in areas such as communication, creative thinking and working with others.'
