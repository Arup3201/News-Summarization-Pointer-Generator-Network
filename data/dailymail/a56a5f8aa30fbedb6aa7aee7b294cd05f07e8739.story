SIMON JONES: Manchester United midfielder Anderson is due to sign for Internacional on Monday.

Talks have been ongoing since last week with the Brazilian side, the player's representatives and United in discussions about cancelling the 26-year-old's contract.

Internacional want Anderson to play in the Copa Libertadores and are understood to have offered a four year contract worth around £25,000 a week after tax with a £650,000 annual bonus.

Anderson is due in Porto Alegre with his agents on Monday for medical tests before being unveiled on Tuesday.

SIMON JONES: Nice are going to the French Administrative Tribunal in order to try and have Hatem Ben Arfa available to play for them this season. The Ligue 1 side signed the Frenchman from Newcastle United earlier this month.

However, Fifa ruled that Ben Arfa could not play for the club this season as he has already played for two clubs Newcastle and Hull.

Nice are citing the example of Manchester City midfielder Bruno Zuculini who has just cancelled his loan with Valencia to move to Cordoba. Zuculini played for Manchester City in the Community Shield also.

SIMON JONES: Hull City defender Harry Maguire is in talks over a potential loan move to Wigan.

Maguire, who arrived from Sheffield United in the summer, was left out of yesterday's 3-0 defeat to Newcastle.

Manager Steve Bruce wants to help his former club and allow 21-year-old Maguire to gain more experience.

SIMON JONES: Burnley are poised to offer £2.5million for West Bromwich Albion midfielder Graham Dorrans.

The 27-year-old Scotland international has been the subject of loan enquiries from Birmingham, Middlesbrough and Fulham. Burnley also asked about a loan but Albion will only consider a sale and want around £3m.

SIMON JONES: West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa have asked about a loan deal for Tottenham midfielder Etienne Capoue.

The 26-year-old France international was also the subject of interest from Sevilla and Real Sociedad this week and is considering his options as he looks for regular game time. Capoue was left out of yesterday's squad for the game at the Hawthorns.

Tottenham have rejected an offer from AC Milan for Paulinho. Juventus and Inter have aslo expressed an interest in the Brazilian.

SIMON JONES: Tottenham target Seydou Doumbia is poised to join Roma from CSKA Moscow after the clubs reached agreement on a £12million transfer for the Ivory Coast striker.

SIMON JONES: Southampton have intervened in discussions between Inter Milan and Juventus over the future of Dani Osvaldo.

Juventus had offered a £375,000 fee to Inter to take over Osvaldo's loan until the end of the season, however, Southampton, the striker's parent club, want to control the player's future as they consider whether he can be utilised in their own deals as they look to bring in players themselves.

Inter are threatening to sue Osvaldo for breach of contract after he went AWOL from training for two days following a spat with Mauro Icardi and fell out with coach Roberto Mancini. He had been training on his own.

Juventus want Osvaldo to replace Sebastian Giovinco who is moving to Toronto. Osvaldo, 29, was loaned out by Southampton after a training ground fight with Jose Fonte.

SIMON JONES: West Brom have rejected a bid from Al Gharafa for striker Brown Ideye.

The 26-year-old joined last summer for a club record £10million from Dinamo Kiev but has failed to impress with just two goals in 16 appearances.

Qatari club Al Gharafa had initially asked to take Ideye on loan but Albion will only consider a sale and want to recoup the bulk of their summer outlay.

Al Gharafa are considering a revised bid but have three other options as well as Ideye and want to secure a striker before their season kicks off next weekend against Michael Laudrup's Lekhwiya.

NEIL ASHTON: Darren Fletcher's £75,000 a week move to West Ham is in jeopardy after he returned to Manchester United today after failing to agree to terms at Upton Park.

Fletcher, 30, returned to Manchester this morning as West Ham consider their options ahead of his proposed move to Upton Park.

JOHN EDWARDS: Mike Phelan is linking up again with his old Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce at Hull City, as exclusively forecast by Sportsmail last week.

Former United midfielder Phelan has agreed to join Hull boss Bruce as number two at The KC Stadium and could even be there for today's lunchtime kick-off against Newcastle.

Either way, Bruce has confirmed he expects Phelan's appointment as successor to former assistant-manager Steve Agnew to be ratified over the weekend and that the ex-Norwich coach will begin work officially on Monday.

As revealed in Sportsmail, Bruce targeted his one-time Old Trafford colleague as soon as he quit his coaching role at Carrow Road, nearly a fortnight ago, and believes his experience and know-how can prove crucial in steering Hull away from relegation trouble.

Juan Cuadrado and his agent Alessandro Lucci have just arrived in London ahead of completing the move from Fiorentina to Chelsea

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman wants to bring a utility player in before the transfer deadline, with Tonny Vilhena and Filip Djuricic top of his shopping list.

This month, like so many winter windows before it, has been quiet at St Mary's, with the loan addition of Eljero Elia the only arrival at the top-four contenders.

That is how Koeman had planned to keep it until injuries began to mount and midfielder Jack Cork rejected a new contract in favour of a move to Swansea.

Now, the Dutchman is looking to bring in a new player, with his key targets Benfica's Djuricic - a Serbia international who spent the first half of the season on loan to Mainz - and Vilhena at former club Feyenoord.

Costa Rica star Bryan Ruiz looks to have swapped the Championship for a relegation battle in La Liga.

Spanish side Levante announced they had reached an agreement with Fulham for Ruiz, but are waiting for the move to be approved by FIFA. 

Levante said in a statement: 'Levante have signed Bryan Ruiz with the LFP, pending the authorization of FIFA, after Fulham and Levante reached a loan agreement for the player until the end of the season.'

Ruiz scored a last minute winner for Fulham against Reading earlier this month - which was the last of his five goals this season for the Cottagers.
