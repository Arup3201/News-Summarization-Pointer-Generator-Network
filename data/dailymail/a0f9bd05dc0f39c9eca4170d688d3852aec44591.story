If you're a man dating a woman named Jennifer, Jessica or Michelle, then it might be time to start worrying.

According to a new survey, those are the names most often given to women who pick their men for the size of their bank balance rather than for love.

Other names that indicate a preference for money rather than romance include Lisa, Ashley, Amanda and Melissa.

Top of the list: Women named Jennifer and Jessica are most likely to pick cold hard cash over love

1. Jennifer

2. Jessica

3. Michelle

4. Lisa 

5. Ashley

6. Amanda

7. Melissa 

8. Stephanie

9. Nicole

10. Angela

Rounding out the top 10 gold-digger names list, which was compiled by website DirtSearch.org, are Stephanie, Nicole and Angela.

Dirt Search is an American website that lets users check potential partners for evidence of a criminal past or bizarre behaviour courtesy of its database of police records.

The data behind the website's choice of names is the result of more than two million background checks, which found women bearing those names are the most likely to be involved in petty crime.

Illegal ways of making money favoured by the world's Ashleys, Lisas and Jennifers include petty theft, property crime and vandalism.

But it's not just the ladies who have been on the receiving end of a less-than-flattering background check at the hands of the brains behind Dirt Search.

According to the website, men named Michael, David, John and Robert are the most likely to have been caught committing petty crime, while the US state of Arizona was found to have the highest number of people interested in checking their new partner's background.

Exception: Nicole Scherzinger is with Lewis Hamilton for love but not every Nicole chooses the same

Suspect: Women named Lisa or Amanda are also potential gold diggers according to dirtsearch.org

For those who do happen to be dating a Jessica or a Jennifer, the site has this advice. 'Look out for a sense of entitlement and check whether they have trouble paying their bills.

'Gold diggers
 drop hints that they may be evicted or their car might be repossessed 
when instead they are buying $400 shoes and watches.'

Other warning signs, say the brains behind the site, include being more than 15 years younger, never paying for anything and having a penchant for expensive things.
