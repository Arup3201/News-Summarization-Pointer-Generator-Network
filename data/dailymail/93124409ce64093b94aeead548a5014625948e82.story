A crocodile expert has told how a ring on his finger saved his arm when he was attacked by one of his 2.5m maneaters

Craig West spent five days in the Royal Darwin Hospital and needed plastic surgery and stitches on his left arm when his saltwater pet, named Lucifer, turned on him while he was doing maintenance in the croc's pen.

When Lucifer got hold of Mr West's fingers and thumb, he could feel the beast's teeth hit his bones.

Craig West, who has been a reptile wrangler for decades, was attacked by his pet saltwater crocodile, Lucifer

'He grabbed my fingers and pulled them sideways, it was lucky he didn’t have my whole hand or he would have gone into a death roll and ripped it off with my arm,' Mr West told NT News.

But his injuries could have been a lot worse.

A ring given to Mr West by his son a decade ago saved the reptile enthusiast's finger.

The 43-year-old said he was lucky to escape last week's attack.

Mr West was able to pull his hand free when Lucifer released it for a split second to get a better grip.

'A ring my son gave me 10 years ago was on my wedding finger and took a lot of the impact, it saved that finger because a (croc) tooth crunched right through it, the ring had to be cut off,' he said.

The 2.5m croc almost took off one of his fingers but a ring saved it

But with decades of experience behind him as a reptile wrangler, this is not the first time Mr West has had a close call.

He said this latest attack served as a reminder to others who wanted to tangle with salties.

'They’re not a pet they’re not something that’s ever going to be friendly with you,' Mr West said.

'You’ve got to be aware of that all the time because the instant they have the chance to go and grab you, they’ll grab you every time.'

Mr West said a crocodile's reflexes were 15 times faster than a human's.
