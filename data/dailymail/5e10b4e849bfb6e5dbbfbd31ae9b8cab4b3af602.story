A married couple who have dressed alike every day for 33 years say it is the clearest way of showing that 'we're together.'

Donald Featherstone, who made a fortune from inventing the plastic pink flamingo lawn ornament in the late Fifties, and his wife Nancy, told The Sun that they even phone each other when they are not together to ensure that their style is in sync.

Luckily the large Victorian home that they share in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, has enough closet space to house their unique fashion collection which includes 600 custom-made outfits and dozens of identical his and hers accessories.

Synchronized style: Donald and Nancy Featherstone from Fitchburg, Massachusetts, started dressing alike in 1980, four years after they married - they say it is the clearest way of showing that 'we're together'

Dressed to impress: The Featherstone's unique fashion collection includes 600 custom-made outfits

Mr Featherstone, 77, usually wears bold print shirts, while his wife of 36 years dons dresses cut from the same cloth.

Recalling the first time they experimented with the look-alike concept, Mrs Featherstone, 60, said: 'I made Don the same shirt I was wearing. We’ve dressed alike ever since. We love it.'

The former dressmaker, who started making her own clothes aged 12, has sewn hundreds of ensembles in an array of eye-catching fabrics over the years. 

She said she is often drawn to tropical 
prints that remind her of her husband's famous molded bird, which was 
manufactured by Union Products and first hit the market in 1958.

Full-blown obsession: The couple even have matching sleepwear - as does their dog

Some standout twinsets include 
Chesterfield coats topped with bowler hats, brown wool suits and loud 
Christmas-colored Hawaiian shirts.

Their dog Smokey also boasts a wardrobe of his own, and they like to dress him up for special occasions.

The couple's love story started in August 1975 when they met at a hardware convention in Chicago.

That day Mr Featherstone made up his 
mind that 'someday' he would marry Nancy - and a year later,  on July 23, he did.

Ready, set, go: With so many options to choose from the couple say that they base their outfits on whoever gets to the closet first - they own more than 600 pieces of custom-made clothing

Mrs Featherstone said that when she met 
her husband he was 'very prim and proper' and would only wear 
long-sleeved shirts, a tie and a suit.

But following her mother's advice, she started jazzing up his style by making him more colorful outfits.

'I made Don the same shirt I was wearing. We've dressed alike ever since. We love it'

She first had the idea to make duplicate garments after she remembered a tradition at Jennings Junior High School in Missouri, where couples wore matching shirts to the end-of-year dance.

It was in 1977 that the Featherstones first slipped into the same looks - a pair of polyester ‘play shirts'.

Then on Easter Sunday of the same year 
Mr Featherstone stepped out in slacks, a sport coat and pink silky shirt
 while his wife donned a pink, silky dress.

Their dressing-up habit soon became a full-blown obsession and in 1980 they went full-time.

Attracting attention: The Featherstone's synchronized style was documented in the film After Happily Ever After, which explored the secret to wedded success

Today, with so many options to choose from they say that they base their outfits on whoever gets to the closet first.

Mrs Featherstone, told the New York Times in 1997 that neighbors, friends and relatives always ask 'why' they do it.

'I recall Donald saying that he would still feel a little flutter of
 new love every time he saw Nancy'

She replied: 'First and foremost, it's fun! We like it! But it's also the clearest sign we can give that we're together. For Donald and me, that's our deal.'

Meanwhile her husband explained in Kate Schermerhorn's 2011 documentary After Happily Ever After, which explored the secret to wedded success: 'We are always together, and that’s the only way we like to be.'

After working with the Featherstones Ms Schermerhorn described their bond as inspiring.

She
 told MailOnline: 'They definitely seemed very in love and in fact, told
 me that they couldn't remember the last time they had left the house 
separately.

'I recall Donald saying that when they were in the supermarket together he would still feel a little flutter of new love every time he looked down the aisle and saw Nancy.' 

The Featherstones aren't the first two people to show they're together through matching outfits:

Husband and wife Mel and Joey Schwanke from a small city outside Omaha, Nebraska, have dressed alike for more than 35 years and never leave the house unless they are dressed in the same pattern.

'We don’t dare go somewhere without having matching outfits,' Mr Schwanke told KETV. 'Every day, my tie matches her dress.'
