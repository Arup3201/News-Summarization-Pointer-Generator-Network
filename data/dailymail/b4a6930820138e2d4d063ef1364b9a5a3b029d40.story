Neil Lewis, 72, from Colchester, drowned his lodger's cat after it broke his model aeroplane

An elderly man drowned his lodger's cat in an apparent revenge attack after it knocked over his model aeroplane.

Neil Lewis, from Colchester, placed the animal in a pet box before submerging it in the River Colne until it stopped breathing.

The 72-year-old - who owned another cat - later justified his actions by telling police the cat was a 'pain' and 'scratched things'.

The cat was taken to a veterinary surgery after a witness called police, but it was already dead on arrival.  

Colchester Magistrates' Court heard how Lewis's lodger Alexander Hammond had brought the kitten home last November.

He had found it at the town's railway station and was unable to trace its owner.

But the court heard how Lewis -who has bipolar - began developing some 'hatred' for the cat, as it got older.

At one point, Lewis suggested to Mr Hammond that they should take the cat into a nearby meadow and set it loose. 

But in April this year, he had had enough of the cat and decided to carry out the killing.  

Colette Harper, prosecuting, said: 'As it got older, he noticed the defendant had some hatred for the cat.

'He told him he was fed up it because it knocked his model airplane over.'  

She added: 'He was seen to place the pet carrier fully in the water.'

The court was told how, when police arrived at the scene, Lewis told them: 'I didn't like that cat, it was always a pain and scratched things.'

He added: 'There's another cat at home I like - that's my cat.' 

Laura Austin, mitigating, told magistrates that Lewis had a 'significant history of mental health problems'.

She said: 'This was exacerbated by a serious traffic accident he was involved in a year ago. He knows in hindsight what he did was wrong.

'He saw a short-term solution to the perceived problems he was facing at that time, not thinking of the consequences.

'The defendant is a somewhat educated person who, without these mental health difficulties, would have behaved entirely differently.'

Lewis admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

He was given an 18-week prison sentence, which was suspended for two years. He was also put under a lifetime ban which stops him from keeping animals.
