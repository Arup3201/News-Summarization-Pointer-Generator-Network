Two former female employees of Goldman Sachs are seeking class action status for their lawsuit accusing the New York-based bank of widespread gender discrimination and creating a 'boy's club' atmosphere of binge drinking and visits to strip clubs.

H Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich petitioned a Manhattan federal judge today to let them sue Goldman on behalf of current and former female associates and vice presidents.

They said in a filing that they have statements by former Goldman employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence of earnings and promotions from the firm's records to support their claims.

'Women report a "boy's club" atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored,' the filing states.

Ms Chen-Oster and Ms Orlich sued Goldman back in 2010 for unspecified damages and an order requiring the firm to fix the alleged gender bias. With today's filing, they hope broaden their case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at the firm, Bloomberg News reported.

Goldman Sachs has denied their claims and is fighting the lawsuit.

'This is a normal and anticipated 
procedural step for any proposed class action lawsuit and does not 
change the case’s lack of merit,' spokesman David Wells said today in an e-mailed statement.

In it the suit, the two claimed female vice presidents earned 21 per cent less than men and female associates 8 per cent less. They also said Goldman promoted 23 per cent fewer female vice presidents to managing director relative to their male counterparts.

capital management at Goldman, is the only woman among the firm's 10 
executive officers. She was named the 26th most powerful woman in New 
York by Crain's New York Business in 2013.

Goldman didn't elevate a woman to partner until 1986, according to Forbes, 117 years after it was founded.

Denise Shelley, a former vice president at Goldman who left the firm in 2009, said in a separate court filing that men at the bank repeatedly called women 'bimbos', mocked a new employee who won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs.  

Ms Shelley, who sat on the steering committee of Goldman's network for women, said in the filing that she was called a 'party girl' by a managing director after joining colleagues at a bar.

Ms Chen-Oster and Ms Orlich are asking U.S. District Judge Analisa Tores to certify a class of female associaties and vice presidents who worked for Goldman in its investment banking, investment management and securities divisions beginning September 10, 2004.

The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 10-cv-06950, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
