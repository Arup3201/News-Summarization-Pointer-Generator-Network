Two distinguished authors — arguably the most celebrated in their fields — will take centre stage at our autumn literary lunch.

Dickie Arbiter served as Press Secretary to Queen Elizabeth and media manager for Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He is the only royal commentator to have been present at the Queen’s Coronation and her Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees.

As well as his duties as a royal spokesman, he media managed all the Queen’s major ceremonial engagements as well as the arrangements for royal funerals, including that of Diana, Princess of Wales.

He is considered one of the most knowledgeable commentators on the British monarchy, and broadcasts extensively on royal matters both in Britain and abroad.

His new book, On Duty With The Queen, is his frank account of life with the Royal Family, told with the wit and insight of a seasoned raconteur.

We are proud to mark the centenary of the outbreak of World War I with eminent historian and Daily Mail journalist Sir Max Hastings. The prize-winning and best-selling author of numerous books on both World Wars, his latest — Catastrophe: Europe Goes To War 1914 — is a passionate defence of why this was a conflict in which Britain had to fight and a brilliant description of the early theatre of war from Ypres to Serbia, Prussia and Galicia.

Catastrophe has been praised by the critics for its depth of knowledge and empathy for its subjects. As one wrote: ‘This is a magnificent and deeply moving book. With Max Hastings as our guide we are in the hands of a master.’

In the chair once more is Gyles Brandreth, our genial master of ceremonies, whose books include diaries, biographies, the popular Oscar Wilde detective series (‘very entertaining’ with ‘rattlingly elegant dialogue’) and his inspirational The 7 Secrets Of Happiness, now also a one-man show.

HOW TO BOOK

Our lunch is held at the four-star Lancaster London Hotel, West London, overlooking Hyde Park, on Friday, September 26, from noon.

There will be a three-course lunch with wine preceded by a reception with cash bar at which guests can meet the authors. There will also be book signings after lunch.
