An Australian newsreader who declined a challenge to tip a bucket of ice over his head for charity has been met with criticism from people offended by his message.

Sunshine Coast WIN sports presenter Lincoln Humphries delivered the on-air message to 'everyone, everywhere' encouraging them to stop 'pouring fresh water' over their head and 'wasting ice.'

Responding to a viewer's request that he participate in the ALS Project, Humphries said it was a 'worthy cause' but wasting water wasn't necessary in aiding charity considering the shortage of it in other countries.

Queensland newsreader Lincoln Humphries turned down an ice buck challenge on live television

He criticised people who poured ice and water over their head because it was a waste of the resource other countries are short on

He suggested a number of other charities as alternatives to the ALS challenge

He encouraged people to show their support for The Red Cross and Cancer Council, instead.

'Ice is for keeping fresh produce fresh, beers cold and your nipples hard,' he said.

He also said charity was not about 'putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of ice and water.'

Reacting to unpopular feedback about his take on the charity challenge, Humphries reportedly apologised on Facebook where he said he shouldn't have used his position 'as a soap box.'

He also called it a 'gross error of judgement', according to 9news.

But Humphries wouldn't comment about the supposed apology when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. He did however defend the good work that ALS is doing.

He also said he was 'pushing for a national, annual MND day'  to ensure the cause lasts.

'The fundraising has been nothing short of astounding,' he said.

'But we need to make sure it's something with longevity and real meaning.'

He said donating a day to the cause, like Daffodil Day which he is a strong supporter of, would help to maintain its longevity.

'(It's) to ensure this isn't forgotten before the ice melts, so to speak, like so many Internet fads before it,' he said.

It comes as a string of celebrities, both in Australia and around the world, have posted videos on social media showing their support for the ALS Project.

Although he believed the ALS ice bucket challenge was a worthy cause he found a host of alternative charities people should donate to

The newsreader told viewers to 'deal with it' at the conclusion of declining his Ice bucket challenge

Donating or buying from the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul charity stores was also a suggestion of his

Since the ice bucket challenge went viral earlier this month, everyone from Oprah Wingrey to Iggy Azalea and  have taken part in the stunt.

Shane Warne, Kylie Minogue, Jessica Mauboy and Liam Hemsworth have been added to the list of homegrown Australian celebrities to show their support.
