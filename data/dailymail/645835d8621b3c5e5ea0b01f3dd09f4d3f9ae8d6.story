Admissions: Jurors heard that Lewis Dale, pictured, has admitted that he stabbed his grandmother to death

A teenager has admitted stabbing his grandmother to death while high on mephedrone - then stealing her TV to swap for his next fix, a court heard.

Lewis Dale, 17, also repeatedly stabbed his grandfather as he and his wife lay sleeping in their bedroom. Jurors were told that the horrific 2am attack left Irene Dale, 78, dead at the scene.

The jury at Hull Crown Court heard that Mrs Dale shouted 'What are you doing?' to her grandson as he pierced her heart and lungs through their duvet with a kitchen knife.

Dale, who had cut the phone lines, then left the house in a taxi, carrying a suitcase containing a bundle of designer clothes and his grandparents' HDTV, according to prosecutors. He later swapped the television for five grams of party drug mephedrone - also known as 'meow meow'.

He was arrested by armed police later that day, at which point he only had two grams of the drug left.

Dale denies murdering his grandmother and attempting to murder his grandfather.

Adrian 
Strong, prosecuting, told the jury that the facts of the killing were largely admitted, and that they would have to decide whether or not 
Dale had the intention to kill.

The court heard that Dale had been taken in by his grandparents, who let him stay at their home in the weeks leading up to the incident.

On the day of the stabbing, Dale had disappeared for three hours to visit his drug dealer, from whom he bought £50 of mephedrone.

Mr Strong told jurors: 'The defence will claim at the time of the attacks he was the subject of a drug-induced psychosis as a result of him taking mephedrone.

'They will say it is a partial defence to murder. Mephedrone or M-Cat is a relatively new drug which was known as meow meow - a legal high until a few years ago. It is now banned.

Stabbed: Irene Dale, left, died of her wounds in the bed where she was attacked. Allan Dale, right, was also attacked several times as his grandson made his escape, jurors heard

'The prosecution case is Lewis Dale was not suffering from a drug-induced psychosis and was showing the effects of taking this drug.'

Jurors heard how Dale walked into his grandparents' bedroom, wearing a dressing gown with the hood pulled up, at around 2am. Mr Dale Snr awoke to see his grandson armed with a kitchen knife.

'He was aware of a presence in the room,' said Mr Strong. 'Before he could do anything, Allan Dale described how Lewis lunged at him and plunged a knife into his chest.

'As his grandparents lay in bed he repeatedly plunged the kitchen knife into Allan Dale’s upper body, Irene Dale awoke and shouted: "Lewis , what are you doing?"

'Lewis Dale broke off the attack on his grandfather and went around to his grandmother’s side of the bed where he repeatedly stabbed Irene Dale to the chest through the duvet that she had over her.

Accused: Dale, left and right, denies murder and attempted murder. Jurors heard they will have to decide whether he was capable of intending to kill at the time of the attack

'Allan Dale got out of bed, Lewis then stopped the attack on Irene, threw the knife at his grandfather, left the room and went downstairs.

Mr Strong told the jury the weapon Dale used to kill his grandmother was the heaviest one in their kitchen block.

He said: 'If you take the heaviest instrument and aim it at the chest and abdomen you can sure it was an attempt to murder.'

The prosecution also argued that Dale's actions prove he was capable of rational thought, and planning to kill.

Mr Strong said: 'Around the time he was in his grandparents room he was texting his dealer. He was able to take part in a relatively-complicated plan and this is not an illustration of a drug-induced psychosis.'

Scene: The house in Hull where Irene Dale was stabbed to death

'There is no real difference between the drugs transaction at 1.30pm and the one at 3.30am. There is the same element of planning. He had the wherewithal to buy the drugs, made the planning and executions.

'The Crown says if he had a psychotic episode it would have lasted some time. Not one of the people who examined him at the police station recognised psychotic behaviour.

'Lewis Dale was only concerned with himself, when he arrived at the police station. He asked what had been done with his suitcase of designer clothes. He asked what was going to happen to him.

'There was nothing about what he had done to his grandfather. This is someone who is so selfishly motivated to get a drug who steals a TV.

'This was a man thinking about how he was going to satisfy his own needs. Drugs are important in this case, but drugs are more about his motivation for the crime rather than an excuse.'

The trial continues.
