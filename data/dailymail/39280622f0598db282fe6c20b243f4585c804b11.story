AQA Chief Executive Andrew Hall, above, said time saved doing less GCSEs could be used to do extra curricular activities

Teenagers pressured into taking up to 15 GSCEs are being given an education of quantity rather than quality, according to the head of the country’s biggest exam board.

Pupils who are led to believe that taking more subjects is a ‘good thing to do’ are being misled, said Andrew Hall, chief executive of the AQA board.

Instead of having more subjects on offer for testing, schools should provide more time for extra-curricular activities, community volunteering and work experience, said Mr Hall.

And pupils should sit a maximum of eight GCSEs, suggested Mr Hall, so that a greater focus can be given to developing life skills and preparing teenagers for work.

His comments were made as AQA launched a project predicting how the country’s education system will evolve over the next 12 years.

Mr Hall said that if the number of subjects students are examined in is reduced, education standards will improve.

He said there is ‘nothing wrong with a rigorous, solid education system, but not exams for exams sake.

‘Some students without doubt think – or are encouraged to think – that 14 or 15 GCSEs is a good thing to do.

‘My personal opinion is that it’s not. Look at the current Government’s accountability measure – the best eight, with double weighting for maths and English.

‘To me, that doesn’t sound like a bad volume. What the eight is I don’t want to get into, but that leaves space in the curriculum for the other things. Educationally it will be better.

Mr Hall criticised the obsession with achieving high results, and said that little time is given to developing other important skills at school.

‘What’s missed when you are doing these extra GCSEs? I think working in the community is an important part of developing social life.’

‘It’s a middle-class way of describing it, but I think things like leading a Brownie pack is an important life skill for young people.’

A spokesperson for Michael Gove's Department for Education said it should be left to individual schools to decide how many exams their students will take

His speech somes as the Department of Education is redesigning league table to track pupil’s progress in their best eight subjects rather than the number of students getting C grades in five GCSEs.

Mr Hall said the average pupil currently sat around 10 exams but some took up to 15. He said a more innovative approach to teaching using digital technology will stop schools from becoming ‘exam factories’.

He acknowledged that some teachers had lost faith in the examining process because of poor marking saying: ‘On occasions every exam board gets things wrong.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It is down to schools to decide how many GCSE subjects their pupils should study – but it is vital that however many pupils take, it is in their best interests.’

‘Our new 'best eight' accountability measure will ensure that secondary schools will focus on the progress and performance of pupils in a broad range of eight key GCSE subjects, including core academic subjects.’
