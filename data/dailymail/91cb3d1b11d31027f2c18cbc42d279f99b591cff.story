The father of Olympic snowboarder Seth Wescott has died in a boating accident.

James B. Wescott, a retired Colby College track and field coach, from Camden, Maine, died on Tuesday.

The Maine Warden Service recovered his body on Tuesday night from Megunticook Lake

Wardens say the 71-year-old was in a single person sculling boat around 8 a.m. when he fell into the water and failed to resurface.

Divers found his body about 12 hours later.

Mr Wescott was rowing with his friend Jeff Foltz of Camden who heard him cry out before falling into the water.

'It’s the most helpless feeling I’ve ever experienced,' Mr Foltz told the Bangor Daily News on Tuesday afternoon.

'One minute we were having fun and working out. Sixty seconds later, he was gone. You just can’t explain it. You just have to have faith.'

'He was really a magnificent athlete. He was doing things on a cardiovascular level that most 35-year-olds would be proud to do,' he said.

'It wasn’t a rowing accident - something else happened. I couldn’t get to him in time.'

Mr Wescott helped 11 athletes earn All-American status.

His son, Seth Wescott, is a two-time Olympic champion in the snowboard cross event. 

When contacted Tuesday night by email, he sent a photograph of his father rowing in his first Head of the Charles race in Boston last fall.

'I can’t say anything more at this moment,' Mr Wescott wrote, reported the Press Herald.

Mr Wescott retired in 2003 from Colby College.

It said in a statement Tuesday: 'We were deeply saddened to learn of the presumed drowning of Adjunct Professor of Physical Education and Athletics Emeritus James B. Wescott.'
