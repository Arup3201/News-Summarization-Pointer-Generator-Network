Talk about your peaking too early. Normally fans know that these major events are a marathon, not a sprint. And if we did ever forget, then the Olympics comes along every four years to remind us.

With a major football tournament, there is often the sense you can still squeeze in a bit of real life early on, before you formally retire to the settee for the foreseeable future.

Then Fred goes and flops to the floor for a crucial penalty in super slowmo. And Robin van Persie is neither a bird, nor a plane as he is captured by multi cameras gliding through the air for his headed version of the Marco van Basten volley.

Down he goes: Fred goes down to win Brazil a penalty

In other words, do you remember not many weeks ago when some people were saying ‘England against Italy, 11 o’clock at night? That’s a bit late, isn’t it?’.

Cut to Saturday night, and in the words of  a Stevie Wonder classic other than the BBC’s theme tune ‘Another Star’, our nation had caught ‘jungle fever’.

Even before we went across to Gary Lineker and the boys in Rio, other BBC folk were already at it. ‘High pressure will dominate’ weatherman Matt Taylor told us prophetically on the forecast.

While the lady on continuity duties - presumably wrapped in the flag of St George in her voice over booth - exclaimed ‘let’s do this’.

And - because I’m guessing he missed the old ‘barber window’ before he left - even Gary Lineker’s hair looked excited!

When we joined him in the BBC studio, he was doing a reasonable impression of a Harry Enfield Double Take Brother. So much so in fact, that when he told us there was ‘a late injury to Buffon’, you couldn’t help thinking, do you mean your one, Gary? 

Perhaps not surprisingly, the only person who appeared to be remaining super cool under pressure was, mais oui, Thierry Henry.

The experts: The BBC had Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand in the studio

While all around him were in shirtsleeves and starting to glow somewhat with expectation, Monsieur Va Va Voom was suaveness itself. And as if to emphasize the point, he was also sporting what might possibly be the only cardigan in the whole of South America.

The laconic Frenchman is already proving the perfect foil in a finely balanced pundit line up. Alan Shearer is looking very much at home, to me. He seems to really be relishing the rapport that he and Lineker have been building on Match of the Day.

And already in Rio, we’re beginning to feel the benefit. ‘This is Rooney’s biggest game for England. He has to perform’ he insisted. It was a decisive, bold point, and deliberately made.

Then there’s Rio Ferdinand; in Brazil to continue his burgeoning TV apprenticeship. And as the current Premier League pro in the line-up, he played his role with style.

‘You’ve got to kick him’ was his verdict for handling Mario Balotelli. Which may have sounded rather agricultural, but was part of an astute answer that gave us first hand insight into a man we were about to see in the middle of the action.

Not quite with his finger on the pulse was a man who, at times, sounded like someone perhaps ought to check his? Whereas commentator Guy Mowbray sounded like he was in the heart of the action, his co-commentator Phil Neville felt as if he was phoning his work in from his front room. While the missus was upstairs trying to get some sleep!

And it wasn’t so much what he said, it was just the thoroughly flat lined manner in which he said it.

Brother Gary has hit the ground running as a TV pundit. But Phil is going to need some serious producing between now and his next game if he is going to even begin to match his sibling at this tournament.

Of course at times, only downbeat will do. And this was the case when Mowbray sighed ‘the anguish of Roy and Ray’ over what could well end up being the enduring TV image of this game. That of Messrs Hodgson and Lewington simultaneously placing their heads in their hands.

It was a moment of despair that was reflected on the return to the studio. Shearer in particular was ticking there, having earlier called on Rooney to bring his A game.

Backlash: Phil Neville has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on Twitter

He made it clear he didn’t think he had delivered. To which Rio put up a boisterous defence of his former team mate. But Al bit. ‘He’s got to score there, Rio’ he said rather tersely.

Causing Ferdinand to further defend his old pal. Even Henry got involved by pointing out that Rooney had ‘done everything but score’. But Shearer was not letting it go. ‘The most important thing’, he responded unequivocally.

Well, it was hot, and we had lost. But at least it was honest and passionate. And our French friend did manage to lighten the mood a little towards the end when he said of Pirlo’s late free kick, ‘he’s that good he meant to hit the crossbar’.

That got a chuckle from a studio that already feels like you can’t wait to get back to it.But let’s just hope that Phil Neville has also embraced some of that spirit the next time we hear from him.
