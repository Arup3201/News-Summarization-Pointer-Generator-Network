Gerard Houllier regards it as the game which galvanised French football. ‘People started loving football in France from that time,’ he said. ‘Everyone thought they were the victim of something and in France we like victims. We got together. Two years later we were European champions.’ 

It was a sticky July night in Seville with six goals, a tense penalty shootout and tears. Perhaps these emotions did propel France to the top of world football, but anyone who watched that World Cup semi-final in 1982 will remember it for a chilling moment 10 minutes into the second half when Patrick Battiston was knocked out cold by a kung-fu charge from goal by Harald Schumacher.

Cowardly: Keeper Harald Schumacher races from goal but bypasses the ball and and heads for Patrick Battiston

Schumacher's kung-fu charge on Battiston

Battiston crashed into the ground, landed on his front and flipped on to his back. Michel Platini, who had slid the pass for Battiston to chase, was first to the stricken full back. He thought his friend was dead. ‘He had no pulse, he looked so pale,’ said Platini.

When the teams meet in the World Cup, as they do on Friday in Rio de Janeiro, those images are rekindled, still capable of provoking horror: the lifeless figure carried from the field with his right arm dangling limp over the side of the stretcher.

Platini takes Battiston’s hand and holds it as he walks beside the medics, kisses it and lays it gently across his team-mate’s chest before returning to complete the game.

Thankfully, the story has a happy ending. Battiston is today the Academy director at Bordeaux and fully aware of his place in World Cup folklore: the innocent victim to Schumacher’s evil aggressor whenever these European rivals clash.

Sickening: West Germany keeper Harald Schumacher collides with France's Patrick Battiston

‘Entrenched in our memories is this charge by Schumacher who flattened the little Frenchman,’ said 57-year-old Battiston. ‘That’s how things are. People talk to me about 1982 often. But it wasn’t only about me.’ 

He broke two teeth, cracked three ribs and damaged a vertebra but holds no grudge, describing Schumacher as ‘someone who wanted to win at all costs’ and ‘went way over the top’.

Battiston had only just come on as a substitute and recalled how he had noticed from his seat on the bench how the German goalkeeper had seemed ‘hyped up’.

Thirty-two years on, there will be no cry for revenge as the teams meet again in the Maracana  Stadium. ‘I have forgiven,’ said Battiston. ‘We will never know if it was deliberate or not. Over time I have come to realise people have forever marked him with this.’

Back home in Germany after  losing in the final to Italy, Schumacher began to understand the impact his challenge had made — not only on the health of Battiston, who was recovering in hospital — but on the public.

The Cologne goalkeeper made an apology. ‘Maybe he did feel guilty,’ said Battiston. Schumacher would later claim he had been unaware how serious the injury was. Also that French players surrounding Battiston kept him at a distance with threatening glances.

Dutch referee Charles Corver had not even awarded a foul, let alone flashed a yellow card. Houllier, who is at the World Cup as part of FIFA’s technical study group, agreed there is no way the goalkeeper would have stayed on the pitch in the modern game.

Had it occurred this year in  Brazil, Schumacher would have been instantly dismissed for a reckless challenge endangering an opponent and the incident would have been investigated by the same disciplinary chiefs who have banned Luis Suarez from all football for four months for biting.

All hell would break loose if Manuel Neuer performed a similar assault tomorrow. Even in 1982, it was extreme and a television audience was stunned, concerned and aghast at the arrogance of the  German. A goal-kick was awarded and he seemed impatient to take it. He kept putting the ball down, flicking it up, passing it with team-mates, sticking it under his arm as if bored by the delay as the medics attended to Battiston.

Later in his book, Schumacher said: ‘Feeling very awkward, I stood in goal messing around with the ball. It was cowardice. Perhaps it was the first moment in my life when I was a real coward.’Corver claimed he had missed the impact because he followed the ball. Battiston’s effort had bounced narrowly wide.

If anything, it was Schumacher’s flippant post-match remarks offering to pay for the dental work which annoyed him the most. ‘It was pretty gauche,’ said Battiston. ‘To this day I have a cracked vertebra and broken teeth.’

He recently stumbled across footage of the game on television and was intrigued by the drama that unfolded as he slipped into a coma

The match went into extra time where there was an explosion of four goals in little over quarter of an hour. A volley by Marius Tresor and a strike from the edge of the box by Alain Giresse put France 3-1 up. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, unable to start because of injury, came off the bench to pull one back and Klaus Fischer equalised.

It was exactly the style of end-to-end game which has typified this World Cup in Brazil. West Germany’s Uli Stielike was the first to miss from the spot, denied by Jean-Luc Ettori, but Schumacher responded with saves from Didier Six and Maxime Bossis.

The ‘hero’ raised a triumphant arm above his head as Horst Hrubesch won the shootout and the Spanish crowd whistled their disapproval. West Germany were already unpopular, having conspired with Austria to knock Algeria out at the group stage.

France were distraught. After centuries of neighbourly disputes, these two European powers were suddenly fierce rivals in the world of football. Shortly after the World Cup, a French newspaper poll rated Schumacher as the nation’s most hated German, just ahead of Hitler. He was dubbed ‘The Butcher of Seville’.

Two years later, Platini led France to the European title and they  collided with West Germany again in the semi-finals at Mexico 86, in Guadalajara. Again the French were defeated, this time 2-0 and without quite the same drama.

This will be the first World Cup meeting since. Brace yourselves.
