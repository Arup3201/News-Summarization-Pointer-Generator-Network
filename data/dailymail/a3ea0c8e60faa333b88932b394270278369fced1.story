A weekend New York Times story that questioned the government's intelligence following last year's terror attack in Benghazi, Libya has members of Congress crying foul.

Some believe the report's conclusions were calculated to help Hillary Clinton's future political fortunes.

'I don't know why they put it out, unless it was for political reasons,' Rep. Lynn Westmoreland said during a 'Fox and Friends' broadcast on Monday.

The Georgia Republican said the Times was 'laying the groundwork' for a Clinton presidential run.

'Of course, Secretary Clinton was in charge at the time,' said Westmoreland of the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack on state Department facilities.

'I think they're just ... trying to absolve her from the lack of security that was sent over there, the number of requests for security that was turned down.'

The Times reported that the attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi was not solely the result of a pre-planned, carefully coordinated terrorist action, as American intelligence has determined in the 15 months since the military-style assault left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others dead.

Instead, the report claims, an ad hoc group of Islamist militants were largely motivated by a blasphemous video, made in the United States, which circulated on YouTube in the week preceding the attack.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was laid waste by militant Islamists on September 11, 2012, and the Obama administration initially claimed an anti-Islam video sparked the attack -- a claim now reinforced by a controversial New York Times story

On the critical question of whether the Benghazi attack was preplanned by terrorists or generated spontaneously by a street mob, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked a Senate panel in January, 'What difference, at this point, does it make?'

Earlier on the same day as the Benghazi debacle, violent protesters in Cairo, Egypt demonstrated against the video.

And President Barack Obama, 
then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-UN Ambassador Susan 
Rice all pushed that version of events during 
the short time between the Benghazi attack and the 2012 presidential 
election.

But the CIA determined almost immediately that it was a premeditated terror attack. Clinton's State Department sanitized the agency's approved talking points before Rice went on television to denounce the video, removing references to a Libyan terror group affiliated with al-Qaeda.

It was Clinton who presided over the State Department at the time of the attack. Her agency was also faulted, under her leadership, for failing to beef up security in Benghazi after several requests from Stevens.

Now poised to run for the presidency in 2016, Clinton aides see the Benghazi episode as a significant political obstacle. And Republican political operatives told MailOnline that the Times story seemed constructed specifically to help her.

One, a GOP-linked campaign adviser in the swing-state of Ohio, said the report 'was meant to give Hillary Clinton an escape hatch' so she can 'cite The New York Times every time someone claims she lied about the video.'

'We talk about plausible deniability all the time in political scandals,' the operative said. 'We'', this smells like a recipe for political deniability.'

In a ceremony marking the U.S. return of the Benghazi victims' bodies, both Obama and Clinton referred to the anti-Islam video, despite likely knowing the CIA's conclusion that an al-Qaeda-linked group had preplanned the attack

Another,
 an election lawyer in Florida who was central to President George W. 
Bush's razor-thin victory over then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000, said
 that the Times story would 'set the Benghazi investigation back months'
 and 'give the Hillary people something to point to, because God knows 
they can't point to the facts.'

Both asked MailOnline to withhold 
their names. 'It's election season,' said one, 'so it's time to start 
filtering what I say publicly again.'

Two Clinton advisers failed to respond to requests for comment.

New York Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal wrote on Monday that his paper wasn't expressing a political preference with the story.

'Since I will have more to say about which candidate we will endorse in 2016 than any other editor at the Times, let me be clear: We have not chosen Mrs. Clinton. We haven’t chosen anyone,' he wrote.

U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (L) said Monday that the Times was attempting to 'absolve' Hillary Clinton of her responsibility in the Benghazi mess in order to aid her future election hopes

Times reporter David Kirkpatrick, who wrote the contested story, defended his reporting on the Sunday NBC program 'Meet the Press.'

'There's just no chance this was an al-Qaeda attack,' he said, 'if, by al-Qaeda, you mean the organization founded by Osama bin Laden.'

Kirkpatrick wrote on Sunday that he determined 'Benghazi was not infiltrated by al-Qaeda, but nonetheless contained grave local threats to American interests. The attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned, but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs.'

Witnesses to the events of Sept. 11, 2012 told Fox News on Monday that the Times report is 100 per cent wrong.

Benghazi 'was a coordinated attack. It is completely false to say anything else. … It is completely a lie,' one witness said.

Lawmakers, particularly Republicans, agree.

'What we do know is, it was not an accident,' California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa countered during the same broadcast. 'These are terrorist groups, some of them linked to or self-effacing or self-claimed as al-Qaeda-linked.'

Issa chairs that House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has aggressively investigated the causes of the Benghazi attack and allegations that the Obama administration engaged in a post-Benghazi cover-up.

But 'there is a group that was involved [in Benghazi] that claims an affiliation with al-Qaeda,' Issa insisted.

Emotions: President Obama shed a tear in May as he answered tough questions about Benghazi during a rare public press conference

That organization, the Libyan-based Ansar al-Sharia, has claimed partial responsibility for 
the mortar, rocket-propelled grenade and automatic-weapons barrages.

Issa also said he knew of no evidence suggesting that the controversial anti-Islam video gave rise to the attack.

Writing on Sunday about the events of 
Sept. 11, 2012, Kirkpatrick reported that 'a Libyan journalist working 
for The New York Times was blocked from entering by the sentries 
outside, and he learned of the [anti-Islam] film from the fighters who 
stopped him.'

'Other Libyan 
witnesses, too, said they received lectures from the attackers about the
 evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet,' Kirkpatrick 
reported.

Renewed emphasis on the now-infamous video put members of congressional intelligence committees on their heels, and forced 
them to defend their conclusion that al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups 
planned the attack and carried it out with ruthless precision.

The
 resulting debate has been reduced to the thorny but semantic question 
of whether or not Ansar al-Sharia is part of the al-Qaeda network.

Blasphemy: A 13-minute trailer for a low-budget film portrayed the Muslim prophet Muhammad as a gluttonous, vicious womanizer whose parents were unknown to him

Was it an anti-American attack or the product of religious righteousness? The New York Times story has reignited a debate that Congress thought it settled months ago

'The assertion [in the TImes] that Ansar al-Sharia does 
not have links to al-Qaeda was wrong' and contradicted by 'the intelligence, to
 a large volume,' House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Rogers drew careful distinctions between the Pakistan-based 'al-Qaeda core,' led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, and its affiliates – including Ansar al-Sharia – that have sprung up throughout the Arab world.

'Did they have differences of opinion 
with al-Qaeda core? Yes. Do they have affiliations with al-Qaeda core? 
Definitely,' Rogers allowed.

Fellow
 Republican Rep. Peter King, a New Yorker who has chaired the 
intelligence committee in the past, declared on Fox News that 'Ansar 
al-Sharia is considered part of the 
al-Qaeda network, supporters of al-Qaeda, and they have a training camp 
right out near Benghazi. So I’ve known all along it was Ansar 
al-Sharia, and I consider that to be an al-Qaeda affiliate.'

Wrong? Susan Rice, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appeared on five different Sunday talk shows following the Benghazi attack, claiming throughout that it resulted from the video's publication on YouTube

Madame President? Former Secretary of State and former first lady Hillary Clinton is expected to run for president, and GOP operatives suspect the Times story was a conscious effort to give her 'plausible deniability' about the attack which happened on her watch

Rogers insisted that his committee has 'gone through some 4,000 different classified cables leading up to the event, talked to people on the ground during the event, done the postmortem on the event through the committee investigation.'

That effort, he suggested, should trump what a news organization with more limited resources can conclude with any certainty.

California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who sits on Rogers' committee, said U.S. intelligence included intercepted phone calls and other conversations that contradict the Times.

'They didn't have the same access to people who were not aware that they were being listened to,'  said Schiff. 'They were heavily reliant, obviously, on people that they interviewed who had a reason to provide the story that they did.'
