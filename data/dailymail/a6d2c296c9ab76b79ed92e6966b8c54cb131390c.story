Illinois-based Mead Johnson says another batch of tests done on its Enfamil Premium Newborn infant formula found no trace of the bacteria tied to the death of a Missouri baby.

Preliminary hospital tests indicated 10-day-old Avery Cornett died December 18 of a rare infection caused by bacteria known as Cronobacter sakazakii. The source of the bacteria hasn't been determined, but it can be found in powdered formula.

Avery had consumed Enfamil Newborn formula.

Little victim: Ten-day-old Avery Cornett from Missouri, here with his big sister Audrey, from a rare infection after consuming the milk Enfamil

Avery from Lebanon, Missouri, had appeared to suffer from an upset stomach before he died.

The Lebanon Daily Record reported that
Avery was taken to St. John's Hospital-Lebanon late last week after 
appearing lethargic and displaying what his family said were signs of a 
stomach ache.

He was later moved to St. John's 
Hospital-Springfield, and preliminary tests showed that he had 
contracted a rare bacterial infection, Cronobacter sakazakii, the 
newspaper reported. 

He died Sunday after being removed from life support.

National retailers including Walgreen,Kroger and Safeway pulled the powdered infant formula from their shelves.

Wal-Mart pulled the batch of 
powdered baby milk from more than 3,000 of its stores across the U.S,  even 
though the manufacturer claims the batch tested negative for the 
bacterium before being distributed.

But after investigation,The Food and Drug Administration, the
Centers for Disease Control and the Missouri Department of Health found no trace of the bacteria.

Cautionary action: Wal-Mart decided to withdraw the product pending an investigation into Avery's death. Here is the Missouri store where Avery's formula was purchased

Public health investigators will also 
look at environmental factors, such as the water used in preparing the 
powdered formula, and at anything else the baby might have ingested.

A spokesman for Mead Johnson Nutrition, 
which produces the formula, said: 'One of the things every batch of 
product is tested for is Cronobacter. We went back and checked on the 
batch in question, and it had tested negative for Cronobacter.'

The government did not ordered a recall of the 12.5-ounce cans of Enfamil Newborn powder with the lot number ZP1K7G. 

Worrying symptoms: Avery was taken to the hospital when he appeared lethargic and appeared to have an upset stomach

Defence: A spokesman for the company that makes the formula said all products are tested for Cronobacter, and follow up tests on the batch fed to Avery tested negative

The Missouri Department of Health 
advises parents to follow World Health Organization guidelines for 
safely preparing powdered infant formula, Terlizzi said.

'This includes washing your hands 
with soap and water, thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in 
hot, soapy water and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a 
time,' she said.
