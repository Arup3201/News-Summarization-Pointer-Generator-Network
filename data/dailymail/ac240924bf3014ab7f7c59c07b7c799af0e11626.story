Lee Mason is the most decisive referee in the select group when it comes to straight red cards but sometimes he sees ones which just are not there. 

When Gabriel Agbonlahor went into a strong challenge with Ashley Young it was hard to see who had made the foul. Both players were fully committed and the Aston Villa player's momentum meant he caught the Manchester United man with his right leg as he followed through. 

Mason would not have been influenced by the United players who surrounded him, he had already decided and gone for his top pocket where he keeps his red card. I hope the card is rescinded on appeal.

There was an interesting incident at White Hart Lane from which Tottenham got their first goal. 

The home side were rightly awarded a free-kick for handball which Harry Kane took immediately. His pass went towards Christian Eriksen, who was clearly in an offside position, but he ignored the ball. Nacer Chadli ran on to it and crossed for Kane to score. 

The assistant did very well to hold his flag and was absolutely correct to do so. However, replays highlighted that the ball was moving when Kane took the free-kick.

Mike Jones should have seen from this from his position and ordered the free-kick to be retaken.

Another excellent offside decision came from Dave Bryan at Manchester City when Frazier Campbell looked well offside before his overhead kick went just wide. 

Replays showed how good a decision this was but his form was certainly not matched by Peter Kirkup at the other end. 

Trailing 2-0, Crystal Palace should have got back into the game when James McArthur headed home a Yannick Bolasie cross. However, Kirkup flagged for offside when Fernandinho, who was right in front of him, had clearly played McArthur onside.

There was some lovely justice seen at St Mary's when Jon Moss missed Phil Jagielka clearly kick Shane Long when he was in the air. 

Moss must have thought that Jagielka had kicked the ball so wrongly awarded a corner from which Southampton got their opening goal.

Southampton didn't get a penalty for this kick on Shane Long by Phil Jagielka but scored from the corner

Craig Pawson was right to award QPR a penalty when James Morrison pulled back Leroy Fer at a corner, but the home side should have had another when Joey Barton was sent sprawling in the area when caught by Morrison's trailing leg.
