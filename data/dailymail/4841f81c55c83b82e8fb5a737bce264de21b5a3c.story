Britain missed David Cameron’s flagship foreign aid target last year despite handing out an extra £2.7billion, it emerged yesterday.

The figures, buried in an official report, suggest the country could have to fork out up to £750million extra by the end of next month in order to hit the target this year – although Government sources insisted the final increase would be lower.

The revelations are an embarrassment for the Prime Minister who has repeatedly boasted about meeting his pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s annual income on foreign aid.

Ministers are now backing legislation which would make it illegal for future governments to miss the aid target. Critics said the figures demonstrated the ‘idiocy’ of trying to hit an ‘arbitrary’ target.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘This just goes to show the absolute nonsense of committing this ludicrous target into law. We have thrown billions at it and still missed it, and now we will presumably throw hundreds of millions more at it.’

The foreign aid budget was increased by more than 30 per cent last year in order to meet the target. The £2.7billion increase took total spending to £11.5billion.

In April this year the Department for International Development (DfID) boasted this amounted to 0.72 per cent of Britain’s Gross National Income (GNI) – exceeding the target for the first time.

But the latest DfID report suggests that new, higher estimates of GNI mean aid last year actually amounted to 0.67 per cent.

Spending was about £400million short of the sum needed. But, with UK growth running at an estimated 3 per cent, the Government would have to find another £750million to hit the new measure this year.

The problem is similar to the one that landed the UK with a demand for £1.7billion from the European Commission last month.

Estimates of GNI have been revised upwards three times this year by the Office for National Statistics, adding £107billion to the total. The changes mean targets based on GNI have gone up.

The last of these revisions, which added about a third of the total increase, results from EU accounting rules that include estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running. Government sources said DfID will be allowed to stick to old accounting methods this year to ensure a ‘consistent methodology’. The effect of this will be to limit the impact of the rise in GNI.

Our economy will grow ten times faster than that of France this year and four times faster next year, according to official Brussels figures.

The European Commission expects output in the UK to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015. This compares with growth of just 0.3 per cent in France this year and 0.7 per cent next year.

The International Monetary Fund has predicted Britain will next year overtake France to become Europe’s second biggest economy behind Germany.

But, even with this, the figures still suggest aid spending may have to rise by about £500million, taking the total aid budget to £12billion.

DfID insisted it had met the target based on economic figures ‘at the time’. The department declined to comment on the likely implications for this year’s aid budget.

International development minister Desmond Swayne told Total Politics magazine the aid budget is ‘not popular among a significant proportion of the public’ but said it was the right thing to do.

The latest figures come despite a frantic effort by DfID to hit the target last year. A highly critical report by the Commons international development committee revealed ministers splurged almost £100million a day in December.

Last week an independent report slammed DfID for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries.
