A wedding ring accidentally dumped into a trick or treater's candy bag on Halloween has miraculously been found and returned to its rightful owner.

When children from the Chicago suburb Naperville voraciously dug through their Halloween candy they noticed an item that wasn't quite like the others.

The Carlin children had been trick or treating in their uncle's town of Plainfield where worried resident Jennifer Vasek was desperately searching for her wedding ring after accidentally dropping it into a candy bag.

Found: Jennifer Vasek's diamond wedding ring was returned to her after a kind family from a neighboring Chicago suburb spotted it in their Halloween candy  

Returned the treat: David Carlin and his sweet kids returned the Wedding ring to a tearful and overjoyed Vasek the next day after they spotted her fliers reporting her ring had been missing 

'At first, I thought it might be a toy ring,' David Carlin, who works for the state treasurer's office, told the Chicago Tribune.

'I took a photo of it and text-messaged my brother, saying we're going to want to come trick-or-treating in your neighborhood every year from now on.'

Carlin told the Chicago Tribune that he enlisted the help of his two daughters aged 6 and 8 in solving the mystery of the ring.

'The girls immediately got very excited about the prospect of solving the mystery,' he said.

Over in Plainfield,Vasek noticed the diamond inlaid band of her wedding band was missing right before she hopped into the shower that night.

Jennifer Vasek and her husband Joe celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary on October 23 just days before. 

'I'd been giving out handfuls of candy,' said Jennifer Vasek.

'I knew my ring was a little loose, but not to the extent that it might fall off.'

Vasek reported her ring missing to Plainfield police and the next day the Carlins made flyers to post around the town in the hopes they would find the owner of the ring.

'We woke up the next morning, made fliers on the computer, printed them off and jumped in the car to go out there,' Carlin said.

While they were on the way to post their signs David Carlin's brother who lives in Vasek's town saw a saw a sign  saying, 'Lost, wedding ring in trick-or-treat bag.'

Carlin's brother text messaged him of a sign the Vaseks posted and he called Vasek straight way.

Married: Joe and Jennifer Vasek celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary just one week before Halloween

'I pulled off to the side of the road, called the number and told her: 'We have your ring.' All she said was "I'm going to cry!" '

Vasek said she was extremely grateful and was in tears when her ring was returned.

'I was in such joy and shock, I did not find out more information ... as I would like to thank them in some way,” she wrote. 

'We always hear about so many negative things happening in today’s world, I really wanted to spread this positive, as I am truly blessed by this awesome selfless family,' Vasek told the Plainfield Patch.

Vasek tried to give them a reward but the Carlins would not accept.

'Her reaction was the best part of all of this,' Carlin said.

'It lets you know you did the right thing.'

Carlin said he believes in Karma and paying it forward. He referenced a woman from Mesa, Arizona who lost her wedding ring but has yet to get it back. 

Loss: Brooklin Yazzie, from Mesa, Arizona is desperate to find her wedding ring after she accidentally gave it away with the Halloween candy on Friday night

'I don't know if it helps, but maybe if people out there hear about our story it will help encourage that ring to be returned,' Carlin said.

Brooklyn Yazzie from Mesa accidentally gave her ring away in Halloween candy.

Yazzie said the ring is not necessarily expensive but has sentimental value.

She was only 20 years old when she married her husband 10 years ago, and says she couldn’t afford a fancy ring at the time.

‘If you were to try and pawn it or sell it you could probably get $50 for it. It's not an expensive ring,’ she said.

‘It’s my wedding ring, you know? I mean you could replace it but it’s not the same.’

Yazzie has created posters to try and alert people to the lost wedding ring. She has plastered them all around the area where she lives in the hope that someone has it.
