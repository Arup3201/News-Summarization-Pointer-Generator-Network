Fulham finally got their season back on track following the departure of madcap manager Felix Magath with a win against Doncaster Rovers.

Kit Symons has taken temporary charge and in his second game got the vital win they needed to halt a slump of three defeats in a row.

Bryan Ruiz and Dan Burn put them comfortably ahead before half-time, enough to mean James Coppinger's second-half strike meant nothing, although the visitors had a golden opportunity to level proceedings from the penalty spot late on- only for Theo Robinson to have his spot-kick saved by Marcus Bettinelli.

Magath owned up to telling Brede Hangeland to rub cheese soaked in alcohol into an injured thigh while he was in charge, but it was the Doncaster defence that melted away in this Capital One Cup tie.

In the 16th minute, Fernando Amorebieta played a long ball from the back which was nodded down by Hugo Rodallega and crisply finished from eight yards by Ruiz. 

They made it two on 32 minutes when Ross McCormack crossed deep from the left and Dan Burn rose to easily head in from four yards out.

Doncaster's Coppinger all too easily turned Burn and powered a shot past Bettinelli on the hour mark as the visitors got themselves a foothold back into the game.

But Bettinelli wasn't to be beaten again, as he made a smart stop to thwart Robinson from the penalty spot on 77 minutes, after Tim Hoogland was penalised for handball.

The victory may only have been against League One opposition, but it gives them a foundation to build on as they bid to move off the bottom of the Championship table.

Their only win this season apart from this fixture was also in the competition, seeing off west London rivals Brentford in the last round of the Capital One Cup at Griffin Park.
