In a beautiful sea of red, yellow, navy and light blue, more than 1,300 cyclists took to central London's streets on Sunday in aid of Help for Heroes.

They stood on the famous Mall for an extraordinary photography to mark out the colours of the iconic medal logo used by the Armed Forces charity.

The Hero Ride saw hundreds of organised bike rides from around the country meeting in Blackheath, before travelling 10 miles to Horse Guards Parade.

Some 300 fundraisers arrived from Paris,
having set off from the French capital with the support of the Duchess 
of Cornwall on Tuesday.

It comes 11 days after the death of soldier Lee Rigby, killed while wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt in Woolwich, south-east London, although the event was planned before this.

A Dawn Raid challenge involved 250 cyclists leaving the Tedworth House Recovery Centre in the garrison town of Tidworth, Wiltshire, at 2am to embark on a 90-mile journey to London.

And over 150 wounded veterans and service personnel paused to pay their respects at the Monument to the Women of the Second World War before riding in formation along The Mall.

The event was expected to raise around £1million for Help for Heroes, which will provide support for those who have suffered injuries in recent conflicts, as well as their families.

Blunt,
who was an officer in the Life Guards and served in Kosovo before 
taking up a music career, said: ‘For me the most inspiring thing was 
seeing at the very front of the peloton a group of our wounded soldiers.

‘Rather than me with my two arms and two legs on my bicycle, some of them are missing one or two or three limbs, and still they've been the fastest and the fittest and the guys with the biggest smiles on their faces.’

The 39-year-old went on to praise the work done by Help for Heroes. ‘We send our soldiers away to 
represent us as a nation to try to bring peace and stability to other 
people's countries as best they can,’ he said.

‘In doing so some of them have given their lives and some have lost limbs and suffered incredible injuries. When they come back, in the past it's been hard for them to have the long term care that they deserve.

‘Help
for Heroes has really enabled the public to do what the public has 
always wanted to do, to support them, to get funds to the right place.’

Cavendish, who is a patron of the charity, praised the crowds who cheered on the riders.

‘I was lucky enough to drive behind a 
group and I saw how everyone was beeping their horns, clapping and 
cheering,’ the 28-year-old said. ‘It was tremendous to see the support for our forces and for Help for Heroes.’

Famous
faces were on hand to lend their support, with Top Gear presenter 
Jeremy Clarkson and former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks seen.

Nick Oxley's father Stephen was one of the cyclists who rode all the way from France to the capital. Nick,
26, who attended the ceremony with his sister Emily, 23, said: ‘We're 
very proud of our dad. His legs are aching but he's still standing.

‘It's been a great day. Help for Heroes is such an important charity. It's so meaningful to so many people. It fills a gap that's not done by the state.’

Carol, 69, and David Hollis, 72, of Chingford, Essex, turned up to the event to show their support for the charity.

Mrs Hollis said: ‘Help for Heroes is a brilliant charity which I have supported for a while. Seeing all those cyclists ride into the House Guards Parade was amazing. I got goose-pimples. An event like this shows people what the charity does and what it stands for.

‘Help for Heroes has been in the news a lot since the death of Lee Rigby. This is a great tribute to Lee and is a good news story for the charity.’
