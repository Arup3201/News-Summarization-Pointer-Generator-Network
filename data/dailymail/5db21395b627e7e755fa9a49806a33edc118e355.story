Walter Smith has ruled out a return to Rangers in any official capacity.

The Ibrox legend admitted on Tuesday that he regrets becoming a non-executive director under Charles Green’s regime in November 2012, before being elevated to chairman six months later.

He resigned from that role in August 2013 – citing a ‘highly dysfunctional environment’ – and is adamant that his only future involvement at the club will be as a fan.

Three years ago, Smith was involved in a takeover bid that included Douglas Park - whose consortium is still awaiting an answer on the £6.5million emergency funding package they have offered the current board.

However, while insisting Park would be well capable of restoring ‘trust’ between supporters and the hierarchy, the 66-year-old wouldn’t be tempted by a comeback to a formal role under any regime.

‘No, I wouldn’t go back onto the board again,’ said Smith, speaking at the launch of Level5 PR, a Glasgow-based media relations and sports management company.

‘I found it was an environment I wasn’t particularly comfortable in. I went on (the board) for what I felt were the right reasons. I thought at the time I could maybe help. As it turned out, I was wrong.

‘I had resigned on two occasions and then eventually, being more or less the last man standing, I took the chairman’s position for a wee while to see if I could help.

‘I quickly realised that wasn’t going to be the case. There was nothing I could do to make any difference so I stepped away. I wouldn’t become involved as a director or anything like that again.’

Asked if that reluctance would extend to a technical position, such as director of football, he added: ‘Walter Smith as a manager would never have had anything to do with a director of football.

‘If you are a football manager you run the club.

‘I’m not going back. I’ll go back as a supporter. I’ve been along to a few of the games. That’s really what I’ll be doing now, taking my grandkids to a few of the games. I hope they can maybe support a Rangers more like the one I used to support myself.’

Smith, who won 10 league titles over two spells as Rangers boss, still reflects ruefully on accepting the directorship in the first place.

‘Is it a regret? Yes, it is,’ he said. ‘I did what I thought was best to try and help out. I think that if you were seen not to be trying to help after what happened with Craig Whyte then people would have said you know a bit about the club and should go back in. But it turned out that wouldn’t have mattered anyway.

‘I don’t think anyone would have thought all this would have carried on over three or four years. It has been turmoil more or less throughout this time.’
