Richard Montañez is a walking, talking American Dream.

Working as a janitor at a California factory with no qualifications and barely able to speak English, the Mexican native's simple idea for a snack took him from mopping floors to meeting U.S. presidents and flying in corporate jets.

It all started in 1976 at the Frito-Lay plant in Rancho Cucamonga, when a machine broke in the Cheetos assembly line.

'Some of them were missing the cheese because the machine had broken, so I took some home. I put some chili powder on it, and it tasted good, Montañez said.

American Dream: Richard Montanez spoke at an annual Power of Diversity event and told the crowd how his 'PhD' - poor, hungry and determined - lead him to the position of executive vice president, multicultural sales and community activation, for PepsiCo North America

So he came up with a recipe that
 his family, friends and coworkers loved before making the brave decision to take his 
idea to the CEO of the company.

The father-of-three persuaded the secretary to put his call through to the CEO who, after hearing his idea, invited him to do a demonstration.

Montañez didn't even own a tie, but 
he rushed out to buy one and picked up a book on marketing from the 
library to prepare his pitch.

The
 president loved the idea and since then, the flaming hot line of 
products was born, including 'Flamin' Hot Cheetos' - which is one of 
Frito-Lay’s top selling snacks.

Great idea: Flamin' Hot Cheetos are now one of Frito-Lay's biggest selling snack

The 55-year-old's simple idea also influenced future ethnic products including Hispanic products for KFC and Taco Bell.

Montañez was a keynote speaker on Tuesday at the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce’s annual Power of Diversity event.

During his speech, he told the crowd how his 'PhD' - poor, hungry and determined - lead him to the position of executive vice president, multicultural sales and community activation, for PepsiCo North America, The Kansas City Star reported.

'If you’re leading a company and you 
don’t have diversity, you don’t have inclusion. I don’t know how you’re 
going to survive,' he said. 'I 
don’t know how you got this far.

'My disqualifications are the very things
 that qualified me. Your own people will hold you back,' he
 warned them. 'Break ranks. That’s diversity and inclusion. Don’t just 
hang out with your own.'

His prime message was that 'there’s no such thing as "just a janitor"...if you act like an owner'.

In the last three decades, the former janitor has met U.S. presidents, spoken at the United Nations, teaches leadership to MBA students at a California University and travels in corporate jets.

He was recognized by Hispanic Lifestyle magazine as one of the most influential Hispanics in corporate America and has been featured in News Week and Fortune 500 magazine.

The 55-year-old often tells a story from his childhood, when the other kids in school would stare at him because he brought in a burrito for lunch and they all had bologna sandwiches.

When he asked his mother if she could make him the same lunch as the other kids, she said no and told him, 'This is who you are'.

The next day she gave him two burritos and told him to make a friend. By the end of the week, he was selling them for 25 cent each. 

Since becoming a success, he has given back to his community by providing scholarships to young Latinos as well as food, clothing, school supplies and other services for Feed the Children.

The father-of-three still lives in Rancho Cucamonga with his wife of more than 30 years, Judy.
