Calais Mayor Madame Natacha Bouchart has proposed a 'Sangatte 2' hostel in the town for 400 migrants

A children’s summer camp set in idyllic surroundings on the outskirts of Calais could soon become home to hundreds of destitute UK bound migrants.

The town’s mayor, Madame Natacha Bouchart, has proposed a ‘Sangatte 2’ hostel for 400 migrants to appease the local population of the port where currently 1300 Asians and Africans are squatting in sordid camps and disused buildings.

Sources say the Jules Ferry leisure camp set in open countryside next to a beach and sand dunes looking over to the white cliffs of Dover is the most likely of four potential locations favoured by local politicians.

The camp’s buildings are capable of housing several hundred people and are fully equipped with sanitary, shower and cooking facilities. It is located about three miles from the town centre and the ferry terminal.

Both Madame Bouchart and president of a charity organisation which feeds migrants, Jean Claude Lenoir, are both said to favour the summer camp.

But the Jules Ferry camp’s proximity to the port’s ferry terminal and trucker’s depots is likely to enrage lorry drivers who regularly clash with migrants attempting to break into their trailers and stow away to the UK on ferries to Dover.

If the camp is turned into ‘Sangatte 2’ migrants would be able to take shortcuts through the sand dunes passing Second World War German bunkers and reach the truckers’ depots within half an hour on foot.

Meanwhile, the former director of the original Sangatte hostel run by the Red Cross has warned that the creation of new state-run hostel would escalate the number of migrants coming to Calais, causing more chaos.

In an interview with newspaper Voix du Nord Michel Derr, said when Sangatte was created in October 1999 the number of people arriving tripled in just three months.

The majority of Calais migrants are camping at what has been dubbed ‘Jungle 2’, a vast open air squat with no running water or toilets situated on land owned by a chemical factory.

Hundreds more migrants are being housed and fed in huts provided by local village councils and charity groups at Teteghem and Grande Synthe near Dunkirk as well as Norrent Fontes on the motorway south of Calais.

In early August the factory obtained a court order for the eviction of the migrants at ‘Jungle 2’ but Calais prefect Denis Robin announced he would only bulldoze the camp after migrants had been informed of their asylum rights in France.

It is feared they may break into trucks or stow away to the UK
