Multiple people were injured today as chaos broke out on the streets of Bangkok the day before a general election which has divided Thailand.

Gunshots rang out while at least two explosions were heard at anti-government protests, with six people wonded in front of a suburban shopping mall in the north of the city.

Sporadic gunfire continued into the evening, with masked men openly firing handguns as security forces used M-16 rifles to fire warning shots into the air.

Tomorrow's election is almost certain to return prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra to power, despite efforts by some opposition supporters to disrupt the poll.

The violence came amid generally peaceful protests around Bangkok and revived chilling memories of political unrest in 2010, when supporters of former leader Thaksin Shinawatra - Ms Yingluck's brother - paralysed Bangkok in protest against the Democrat Party.

Today's attack took place in Bangkok's Laksi district, close to the Don Muang airport, where Ms Yingluck's fans gathered in support of the election.

Ten people have died and at least 577 have been wounded in politically related violence since late November.

The protests' leader, opposition boss Suthep Thaugsuban, has called for a peaceful blockade of roads, but has vowed not to stop people voting.

'The people will not close the polling booths, but will demonstrate on the roads,' he said yesterday. 'They will demonstrate calmly, peacefully, without violence. We won't do anything that will hinder people from going to vote.'

Election Commission secretary-general Puchong Nutrawong said the commission has instructed staff to halt voting if there is rioting or other violence.

'We don't want this election to be bloody,' he said. 'We can get every single agency involved to make this election happen, but if there's blood, what's the point?'

The military has stayed firmly on the sidelines so far, in contrast to the past. It has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy.

Ms Yingluck's party will almost definitely win the election, which the Democrat Party is boycotting, but experts expect further stalemate as the opposition is unlikely to accept the result.

The protesters, camped out at major intersections in the city and blocking key roads, forced polling stations in 49 of Bangkok's 50 districts to shut last weekend - some voters were physically pulled away from the polling booths.

Mr Suthep wants to rid the country of the Shinawatra family's political influence and accuses MsYingluck, who swept to power in the last election in 2011, of being Mr Thaksin's puppet.

The protesters say Mr Thaksin - who now lives in Dubai to avoid a jail term for graft - is a corrupt crony capitalist who took advantage Thailand's fragile democracy, using taxpayers' money to buy votes with populist giveaways.

Mr Suthep wants to set up a 'people's council' of notable individuals before another election is held, effectively undermining the country's democratic processes.
