As Britons across the UK look forward to the last Bank Holiday of the summer, research reveals the average person will spend an extra £113 over the three-day weekend.

In a bid to make the most of their extra day off, Britons spend 120 per cent more than they would on a normal weekend.

Over the course of an average weekend, people spend around £94 but when it comes to a Bank Holiday all thoughts of budget go out of the window – with spend increasing to a whopping £207 per weekend per person. 

Bank Holiday: Going for a walk and going on a day trip are listed in the top 10 activities to do over the weekend

1. Go for a walk

2. Life admin

3. Go out for lunch

4. Go on a day trip

5. Go out for dinner

6. Go out for breakfast

7. Go away for the weekend

8. Stay with friends

9. Visit an attraction

10. Have people to stay 

Out of the 2,000 British adults questioned for the latest survey, one in eight claimed their spending got out of control, while nearly a quarter admitted they'd spend more than they usually would.

While the luxury of having an extra day off allows Brits to fit in some cheap and cheerful activities, including long walks and life admin, eating out is hot on the agenda for the Bank Holiday.

Those enjoying the extra day off will enjoy at least three meals at a bar or a restaurant - three times as often as on a normal weekend.

Train carriages and car parks will also fill up as more than half of the UK's residents head out on a day trip away from their home town, with the average Brit budgeting £42.10 to get away. 

Going out for breakfast, lunch or dinner are among the top things that Brits like to do over the long weekend

Those in the West Midlands are set to splurge the most, spending 90 per cent more than on a normal weekend – £354.27 – followed by Londoners, who will splash £350.29 (80 per cent more), and people in Yorkshire, who will spend £310.98 (98 per cent more than usual).

Brummies are most likely to hit their local attractions and eateries over the Bank Holiday, whilst the people of Wales are most likely to leave town and go away for the weekend.

'As the summer draws to a close, it's clear that we Brits are keen to go out with a bang, splurging more than double the amount we usually would as we make the most of the extra day off,' says Anita Naik, Consumer Editor of Vouchercodes.co.uk.
