A hat-trick of tries from winger Joel Monaghan helped Warrington complete a stunning comeback against local rivals Widnes in a thrilling Super League play-off clash at the Halliwell Jones stadium.

The Wolves, aiming for a third successive Grand Final appearance at Old Trafford, looked to be in danger of falling at the first hurdle as they trailed the Kevin Brown inspired Vikings 18-0 after half an hour.

But Monaghan, Super League’s top try-scorer, was on hand to rescue his side with his three-try haul and Rhys Evans also touched down with Stefan Ratchford landing three excellent touchline conversions to settle an epic contest 22-19.

The one downside for Tony Smith’s team was what looked a serious injury to full back Matty Russell who was stretchered from the field following a second-half collision with Macgraff Leuluai.

Brown, who earned selection in the Super League Dream Team for the first time this week, created all three Widnes tries in a dominant first half first for the Vikings but they just ran out of steam in the second half.

Paddy Flynn claimed two tries for the visitors and Rhys Hanbury also touched down with Danny Tickle landing three goals and Brown a drop-goal as they led 19-6 at half time but failed to add to their score in the second period.

The Wolves now face the rest of the play-off games on the road and will travel to Challenge Cup finalists Castleford in the next round.

Warrington were without injured skipper Ben Westwood and Simon Grix as well as the suspended Paul Wood but welcomed back centre Ryan Atkins after missing the previous week’s defeat at Wigan.

The Vikings were still without centre Stefan Marsh but captain Jon Clarke, Brown, Hanbury, Eamon O’Carroll and Tickle all returned after being rested for the final regular-season game at Salford.

Widnes, making their first appearance in the play-offs after finishing eighth in the Super League table, made the perfect start as they stunned the Wolves with two almost identical tries in the opening nine minutes.

The Vikings took full advantage when Warrington were penalised for obstruction in the opening stages and that allowed the visitors to set up the position from which Brown put in an inch perfect kick and Flynn just managed to touch down.

And Widnes repeated the dose four minutes later when it was Brown again whose perfectly placed kick over the Wolves line allowed Flynn to just beat Evans to the touch.

Tickle kicked two excellent touchline conversions to give Widnes a 12-0 lead.

It got even better for the Vikings after half an hour when the impressive Brown sent Hanbury racing clear and he evaded the attemped tackle of Russell to score. Tickle again converted to make it 18-0.

On one of their rare forays into Widnes territory the Wolves posted their first points four minutes before half time when some crisp passing from Richie Myler and Chris Bridge allowed Monaghan to touch down in the corner.

Ratchford landed his conversion attempt from the touchline to cut the Widnes lead to 18-6.

But two minutes before half time the influential Brown cooly added a drop goal to give his side a 19-6 lead at half time.

Warrington claimed their second try of the game three minutes after the restart when a superb pass out of the tackle by Bridge allowed Monaghan to claim his second try of the game and Ratchford again landed an excellent touchline conversion to make it 19-12.

And five minutes later Warrington scored again when Evans crossed in the corner and cut the deficit to three points at 19-16.

The Wolves hit the front on 56 minutes when a break down the right by Bridge released Monaghan to claim his hat-trick and Ratchford was once again on target with the conversion to make it 22-19.
