The 50p top rate of tax looks certain to be abolished for high earners by 2013, while tax breaks are to be accelerated for millions at the other end of the income scale.

In tandem with a move to scrap the rate, Chancellor George Osborne is expected to speed up moves to raise the threshold at which income tax kicks in to £10,000.

A senior Cabinet minister admitted yesterday the supertax is doing ‘more harm than good’.

Well-timed intervention? Eric Pickles said he backed calls to scrap the 50p tax rate on incomes over £150,000 as George Osborne faced more pressure to act

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles 
spoke out after 20 of Britain’s leading economists called on Mr Osborne 
to scrap the tax, introduced by Labour at the height of the financial 
crisis.

But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls claimed a temporary cut in the VAT rate to cut prices at the checkout would be more likely to kick start the economy.

In a joint letter yesterday, 20 
leading economists – including former Bank of England Monetary Policy 
Committee members Dr DeAnne Julius and Dr Sushil Wadhwani – warned that 
Britain now has one of the highest personal tax regimes in the 
industrialised world.

This makes it ‘less competitive 
internationally, and making us less attractive as a destination for both
foreign investment and talented workers’, they wrote.

Mr Osborne describes the tax, levied 
on income over £150,000, as a ‘temporary measure’. There is growing 
speculation that in his Budget next spring he will announce the 50p rate
is to be scrapped the following year.

But abolishing a levy which affects only the wealthiest 320,000 people in Britain will be fraught with political danger.

Is it worth scrapping the 50p tax rate to boost the economy?

The Chancellor has commissioned 
research into whether the tax loses more revenue than it brings in by 
driving wealth creators away and encouraging tax evasion.

Mr Pickles 
said: ‘There is a strong case to say [the 50p tax rate] isn’t actually 
contributing very much and on balance is probably doing more damage than
good.’

Lib Dem sources said their price for agreeing to abolish the tax would be an alternative tax on the wealthy.

Business Secretary Vince Cable is 
pushing to revive his idea of a ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than 
either £1million or £2million.

But Lib Dem colleagues say that is 
unlikely to be approved by Mr Osborne and are working on proposals for 
alternative taxes on the wealthy once the 50p rate is scrapped.

‘We are 
not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate, but when you’re saying 
everyone must pay their share you do have to ensure that means 
everyone,’ said one.

Keep 50p tax: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the Government would be better off cutting the rate of VAT to boost economic growth

The 50p tax affects nearly 320,000 taxpayers – 1 
per cent of the total number of taxpayers. They contribute 24 per cent 
of income tax raised by the Government, according to HMRC figures.

Former Conservative Cabinet minister 
John Redwood said scrapping the 50p rate would actually lead to an 
increase in the overall tax take from high-earners. He added: ‘Unless we
get more money out of the rich we are not going to get the deficit 
down.’

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said cutting the 50p tax rate was ‘the last thing we want to do’.

‘If you have any money for tax cuts, 
you don’t give it to the top one per cent of people, who tend to 
actually save quite a lot of it. It should be given to those at the 
bottom, to raise the tax-free allowance up to £10,000, because people in
that situation will go out and spend it in the shops.’

Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told BBC Breakfast that the Government would be better off cutting VAT.

'If you really want to get spending and purchasing power into the economy quickly, rather than doing it through personal allowances, which tends to be a bit diffuse, better to have a temporary cut in VAT because a cut in VAT puts money into people's pockets straight away. It will have more of an impact upon the economy,' he said.

'But to be honest, if he was to do personal allowances rather than VAT it would be such a change of direction.'

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The 50p 
rate is a temporary measure. The Government is committed to a 
competitive tax system, but in reducing the deficit, we have always been
clear those with the broadest shoulders should carry the greatest 
burden.’

Talks: Ana Botin accidentally showed off the paperwork as she left Downing Street

The chief 
executive of Santander was photographed in Downing Street yesterday with
papers suggesting she had been tipped off that banking reforms would be
delayed.

Spaniard
Ana Botin had been for private talks with the Chancellor George Osborne
ahead of the release of a report by the Independent Commission on 
Banking into the future of the industry.

The
ICB is expected to call for banks to be ring-fenced, separating their 
‘casino-banking’ investment divisions from the retail divisions.

But
Miss Botin had a document which stated: ‘It will take a significant 
amount of time before any changes (from the ICB report) are legislated.’

There has been mounting 
speculation that the reforms will be shelved until at least 2015 because
of warnings from banks that they could trigger another downturn.

It
came as Business Secretary Vince Cable holds a meeting today with 
smaller banks, such as Metro Bank, Virgin Money, Aldermore and Walton 
& Co, to discuss how the Coalition can make it ‘easier’ for new 
banks to establish themselves in the UK.

Blunders with documents outside No 10 are not unusual, and Miss Botin is in good company.

Development
Secretary Andrew Mitchell last week risked a diplomatic row when he accidentally
showed off a secret Government memo welcoming the departure of 
Afghanistan's President Karzai.
