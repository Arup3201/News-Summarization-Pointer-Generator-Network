Mauricio Pochettino is getting tough with his under-performing Tottenham squad and insists that player reputations mean nothing to him.

The Spurs manager won his first four matches in charge at the club, after taking over in the summer, but has since lost two and drawn two.

They now face a tricky tie against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night in the Capital One Cup to turn that form around, where places for Saturday's north London derby against Arsenal are up for grabs.

One of the difficulties the former Southampton boss faces is utilising a squad largely assembled under Andre Villas-Boas, in a period when chairman Daniel Levy sanctioned more than £100million worth of transfers after Gareth Bale moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee.

Some of the larger deals included signing Roberto Soldado from Valencia for £26million Erik Lamela from Roma for £25.7million and Paulinho from Corinthians at a cost of £17million.

But when asked if reputations meant anything to him, Pochettino replied: 'No, I select the team, but they, the players, show me. They are not different. We have 25 or 26 players and they are all in the squad. If I decide you play, you play, but the name is nothing for me when I pick my team.'

Their recent poor form was particularly apparent in the shock slump at home to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, when they lost 1-0 to a side bottom of the league.

Pochettino revealed that he has been 'straight' with his players that the performance, in which they had 63 per cent possession but only one shot on target, was not acceptable.

'To build a winning mentality and a winning team, sometimes you need to lose, you need a big hit in your face to change sometimes the energy and realise that you need to fight every game,' Pochettino added, displaying an adept understanding of metaphor despite his, at times, patchy English.

'You need to fight every training session, you need to play like a team and you need to show more energy like a team in the competition.'

The Forest match is the players' last chance to impress upon Pochettino that they deserve a place in the side for the derby match at the weekend.

And the Argentine has no problem with dropping those who he feels are not playing to the standard he expects, regardless of their price tag.

He added: 'We analyse every game and every performance and after we decide. For me, when I pick the best players for playing in each game, always I analyse how was the last performance.

'And I have no problem to pick different players in different competitions or if it's not in a good moment, if you need to change, you change. It's not a big problem.'
