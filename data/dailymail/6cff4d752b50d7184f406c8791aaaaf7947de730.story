Controversial Tory MP Nadine Dorries has landed signed a ‘six-figure’ book deal to write three novels.

The outspoken backbencher who stunned Westminster with an appearance on I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! hopes to build on her profile by becoming an author.

She told the Mail her book would be offer ‘shock’ value but would not be ‘chick-lit’.

Author: Tory MP Nadine Dorries, a former nurse-turned politician, is adding another skill to her CV

Known for her ability to craft sharp 
political soundbites and putdowns – notably ridiculing David Cameron and
George Osborne as ‘posh boys’ – her publisher hailed her for a 
‘heart-stopping way with words’.

The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire, who appeared on last year's I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!, is expected publish the first part of the trilogy next year.

Mrs Dorries told the Mail: ‘I was blown away by the response. It is just something I did in my downtime. It may surprise people to know that I am not an MP 24/7. I wrote the first book in recess last year and am half-way through the second. I have had time to do it since my daughters have flown the nest, nobody is dependent on me.’

She dismissed critics who queried how she had the time to pen novels between her parliamentary and constituency duties.

‘Lots of male MPs have written books, including William Hague. Nick Boles has written two. Why does no one ever ask how they manage it?’

Born in in 1957, one of three daughters, Nadine Dorries grew up in Liverpool, attending  Halewood Grange Comprehensive before training as a nurse.

Writing for the Mail on Sunday in 2010, she revealed her childhood memories which will form the basis of her novels:

'I spent 25 years in a council house, and whenever I think of my childhood in Liverpool the memories are set in relief against the backdrop of my family home.

I think of Thursday nights, when the week’s pay had run out and how the mothers in my street used to group together and cook a pan of scouse and feed the streets kids, in one kitchen.

The pan was big, having at some time, I am sure, fallen off the back of a ship moored in Liverpool docks.

We were the originators of the Big Society. We lived and breathed it. I may have lived on a council estate but I also lived in a neighbourly community.

It came as a shock, when I reached my teens, to discover that all the neighbours I had referred to as auntie and uncle were not in fact related to me.

Our council house was our home and it meant as much to us as Blenheim does to the Duke of Marlborough.

An Englishman’s home is his castle but castles come in all shapes and sizes.

Publishers Head of Zeus said the 
novel, called The Four Streets, is one of three ‘set in 1950s Liverpool 
about Irish Catholic families struggling against poverty, hardship and 
abuse’, and will be published in April.

Editor
Rosie de Courcy said she 'had to have' the book on her list of new 
releases: ‘I absolutely adored this novel from first word to last. 
Nadine is one of the most naturally gifted storytellers I have ever come
across, with a magical ability to create characters you believe in and a
heart-stopping way with words.

Mrs
Dorries has often spoken of her life growing up in Liverpool in the 
1950s and 1960s, living in a council house which formed the backdrop of 
her childhood memories.

She was suspended from the Tory
party in November last year after jetting off to take part in I’m A 
Celebrity without permission.

Defending her decision to take part in the show she claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions, discussing important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit.

She said at the time: 'If that is where sixteen million people are, it's where politicians need to be too.'

Instead she was pictured performing jokes with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather and eating camel toe and ostrich anus in a challenge against ex-Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan.

It took until May until Tory bosses were satisfied that she would fall into line, and she had the whip restored in time for the Queen’s Speech.

A former nurse, she worked in business and as an adviser to Conservative MP Oliver Letwin before being elected to Mid Bedfordshire in 2005.

In recent years she has been a constant critic of the Prime Minister and Chancellor.

Last year she declared: 'The problem is that policy is being run by two public schoolboys who don't know what it's like to go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because they can't afford it for their children's lunchboxes.

'What's worse, they don't care, either'

A month later she stepped up the attack, claiming: ‘Not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others - and that is their real crime.'

However, amid claims she could defect to the UK Independence Party,  the Tory leadership agreed to let her return to fold as long as she agreed to toe the line.

In June she announced she would stop claiming parliamentary expenses and insisted all MPs should be paid one flat-rate fee.

In a posting on her website, she said her decision would mean she would effectively be working for her constituents for free.

'I have long said that under the present system, before long, Parliament will be a place of millionaires or paupers. I loathe the expenses system and believe it should be scrapped and MPs paid one flat-rate fee,' she said.

'Whilst I draw personal expenses, I cannot argue for reform of the system or put forward the case to scrap expenses. Not drawing expenses puts me in a stronger position to be able to do this.'
