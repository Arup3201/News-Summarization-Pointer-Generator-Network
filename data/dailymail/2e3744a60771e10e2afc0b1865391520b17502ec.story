Get yourself ready for the Grand National with Sportsmail's brilliant sweepstake kit.

Simply print out the sheet, then cut the
names into individual pieces of paper, fold them and put them into a hat ahead of the big race on Saturday, April 11.

Once
 you're ready, you can start your own sweepstake at work, at home or 
down the pub. Charge as much as you like per entry (or as much as people
are willing to pay).

Pineau De Re won the 2014 Grand National at Aintree

The 2015 Grand National will take place on Saturday, April 11 at Aintree

Get people to pay their entry fee and draw a
name from the hat at random. Write down who draws which horse on the corresponding ticket (it saves a lot of argument later!).

Make sure you sell all of the horses. If you have some left
after everyone has brought a horse see if anyone wants another.

Obviously you're free to split the winnings how you wish,
but make sure all the money is paid out in prizes. We suggest you split the
winnings as follows: 1st=60 per cent; 2nd=25 per cent; 3rd=10 per cent; 4th=5 per cent.

A maximum of 40 runners can line up in the race and any withdrawals will mean horses outside the current top 40 will be allowed to run.The horses next in line to move into a starting position are: 41 Alvarado (Trainer Fergal Oâ€™Brien), 42 Soll (David Pipe), 43 Ely Brown (Charlie Longsdon), 44 Royale Knight (Dr Richard Newland), 45 Baileys Concerto (Dianne Sayer), 46 Renard (Venetia Williams)
