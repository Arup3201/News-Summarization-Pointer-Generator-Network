The 54-year-old truck driver dubbed the 'Vampire Trucker' after accusations arose that he kidnapped at least two women and kept them as sex slaves in his semi has prior arrest warrants for assault, it has emerged.

Timothy Jay Vafeades made headlines last week after it was revealed he's accused of holding women hostage for months as they criss-crossed America and even forcing one to wear false 'fangs' with him.

On Monday it was uncovered that he's been wanted for domestic abuse in Florida since November 2012.

Bad trucker: Timothy Jay Vafeades is accused of kidnapped at least two women and holding them against their will in his semitrailer while he traveled the country for work. One of his victims says he wore dentures with vampire fangs, which he seems to be donning in the above Twitter picture

The Miami Herald first reported the finding and the warrant on a misdemeanor charge in Polk County may be read here.

The trucker 'obsessed 
with vampires' is, more seriously, accused of keeping women as unwilling sex slaves while he 
traveled the country for work.

One of those victims includes a 19-year-old relative from Florida.

While
 being held captive, Vafeades filed down a 19-year-old victim's teeth 
with a Dremel after telling her she 'had an ugly smile' and forced her 
to wear dentures while he wore his own pair with vampire fangs.

The truck driver made his first appearance in Minnesota court last Wednesday as he faces charges of kidnapping, transportation for illegal sexual activity and posession of child pornography. If convicted he could face between 10 years and life in prison.

Intimidator: Vafeades successfully kept two women hostage in his semitrailer for months at a time by threatening to beat them if they made eye contact or spoke with anyone

An arrest warrant filed Tuesday in 
Salt Lake City claims Vafeades kidnapped the 19-year-old relative who 
had come from Florida in May 2013 to work with him on his truck, named 
the 'Twilight Express.'

Public
 records indicate Vafeades has been running Twilight Express Trucking 
since 2009, meaning the business name could very well be a reference to 
the popular vampire book series by Stephenie Meyer which was turned into
 a film franchise starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.

On
 their first night on the road, the victim recalls waking up to Vafeades
 sexually assaulting her. She asked what he was doing and he stopped and
 the next day the two traveled on to Wyoming. 

After
 a week on the road, the teen told Vafeades she wanted to go home and 
she grabbed her belongings and went to exit the trailer.

But Vafeades stopped her in her tracks, hitting and strangling her until she blacked out.

For the next six months, Vafeades kept his relative captive with threats and intimidation while they traveled to Washington, Nevada, Texas, Tennessee and other states. Vafeades confiscated the teen's ID and social security card and took the SIM card out of her cell phone so she couldn't make any calls.

She was also forbidden from using public restrooms and was beaten if she made eye contact with strangers.

Despite her pleas, Vafeades forced the teenager to have sex with him more than 100 times during their time together, a criminal complaint states.

Vafeades was arrested at a Clay County, Minnestota, weigh station on November 26, just a few days before Thanksgiving, after officers noticed bruises on the teenager and discovered a 1999 restraining order barring Vafeades from contacting the girl.

Meeting place: Vafeades' second victim says she agreed to go out to dinner with him after meeting him at this truck stop in Salt Lake City, but that he kidnapped her and held her hostage for months

After his arrest, a second woman went 
to authorities to report she had been held captive in Vafeades' truck, 
according to the warrant.

The
 woman told detectives she met the driver at the Sapp Brothers Truck Stop in Salt Lake City in April 2012. She agreed to have dinner with him and got into his 
truck, according to the report, but Vafeades told her about 10 minutes 
into the ride that she was going with him for a week or more.

The
 woman said Vafeades kept her with him for about three months through 
threats and violence, forcing her to have sex with him nearly every day 
and calling her his slave, authorities said.

According to her report, Vafeades told the victim that he 'owner her, that she was never getting out, and that she would do what he told her to do'. He too forbid his victim from making eye contact or talking with anyone, especially men, and if she did he would beat her with a belt while she lay naked on the trailer's sleeper bed. The victim said these beatings happened regularly, sometimes daily and other times weekly.

She said he had her hair cut and colored to disguise her identity and forced her to marry him.

Both
 women said Vafeades watched child pornography often, and a police 
search revealed he kept 'hundreds' of child porn videos and pictures on 
external hard drives. The 19-year-old victim reported that the porn appeared to show girls about 14 years of age.

He also forced the women to do his company paperwork, and never paid them for the work.

The
 trucker faces state charges in Minnesota in addition to the federal 
counts. He is in the Clay County Jail awaiting transfer to Utah.
