Disgraced Florida former teacher Debra Lafave is fighting to be taken off probation eight years after she admitted to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students.

In August a court of appeal reversed a 
trial judge's decision to end Debra Lafave's 10-year non-prison sentence
four years early.

Lafave appealed to the Supreme Court in October and this week she asked the justices to let her remain off probation until they rule.

Dispute: Disgraced Florida former teacher Debra Lafave is fighting to be taken off probation eight years after she admitted to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students, pictured in March

Split: Debra LaFave, left and with her former husband Owen Lafave who she had just married before she had sex with the teenager

The mother-of-two pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year old boy.

Lafave - who is now using her maiden 
name Beasley - was ordered to stay away from children after it was 
discovered she had been having sex with the boy while she was a teacher 
at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida.

Lafave was reported by the boy's mother and was immediately arrested.

She was charged with two counts of felonies after pleading guilty to having sexual intercourse and oral sex on four different occasions with the boy - one of which was at school.

Deal: Lafave, pictured in 2006, avoided as much as 30 years behind bars after she accepted a plea deal

'Too lenient': Lafave appears before Circuit Judge Wayne S. Timmerman, left, in 2005. Timmerman's decision to throw out the rest of Lafave's probation has been criticised - and now overthrown

Excitement: Lafave, who now has two baby twin boys, speaks to reporters in October 2009 after a judge ruled she could have unsupervised contact with children

The disgraced teacher avoided jail entirely, despite facing up to 30 years behind bars if convicted.

The boy's mother did not want him to have to go through the trauma of the trial after learning the it would be televised and agreed to a plea bargain.

She was newly married when she committed the offenses.

Following the court case, she and Owen Lafave divorced and she now has baby twin boys with new love, Shawn Haverfield, 36.

She was then sentenced to only seven years probation and three years house arrest.

The story took a bizarre twist after John Gillespie, the lead detective in her case, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting, while Tampa Bay Police officers were probed when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of Lafave while she was in stirrups in a jail cell.

Racy: Lafave escaped jail time as the boy would not testify and she accepted a plea deal instead

In 2009, once she completed sex offender therapy, a judge allowed her to have contact with her relative's children, though she was still banned from living within 1,000 feet of where children congregate.

But in 2009, Circuit Judge Timmerman said Lafave could have unsupervised
contact with children after she completed sex offender therapy.

And last September, Lafave convinced Timmerman to drop her final four 
years of probation, telling him she had completed the community service,
had two jobs, had two sons and was engaged.

Lafave, who garnered nationwide interest for her striking looks and provocative modelling shots after she committed the crime, is banned from ever teaching in Florida again.
