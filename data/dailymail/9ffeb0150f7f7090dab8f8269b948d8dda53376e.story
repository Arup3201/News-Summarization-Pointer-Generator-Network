Police are hunting a masked gunman who opened fire in a Manchester pub, killing one and wounding three others as they celebrated at a 60th birthday party.

The armed man burst into the Cotton Tree pub, in the city's Droylsden district, shortly before 11.50pm last night and shot dead a 23-year-old man, named by sources as Mark Short.

Three people wounded, believed to be related to Mr Short , have been taken to hospital where their condition is not thought to be life-threatening, Greater Manchester Police said.

Speaking from the scene, Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley said a man burst into the private party and opened fire on a group of men around the pool table.

'We don't believe this to be a random attack, although we are not clear about who the intended victim was,' he said.

'We understand this was a family occasion and that a lone gunman walked into the premises and opened fire on a group of males stood by the pool table.'

Between 20 and 30 people, aged 18-65, were said to be in the pub at the time.

Mr Adderley said officers were keeping an open mind about the motive but said all the victims were known to the police.

Two of the wounded men, aged 25 and 26, were shot in the leg and a 29-year-old man was shot in his lower back. They are in hospital but their injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

The gunman, who was wearing a balaclava, escaped in a Ford Focus, found abandoned and alight in Hattersley soon after.

Extra officers are on patrol in the area and a murder investigation has been launched.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said: 'A young man has been killed in tragic circumstances and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.

'Three others were also seriously injured and I want to reassure the public that we will commit the full resources of our major incident team to investigate this incident.

'We are in the very early stages of this inquiry so to speculate on a motive would not be helpful to our investigation, the victims and their families or the local community.'

He added: 'That said, whoever is responsible has not thought twice about opening fire in a crowded pub and I would urge anyone with information about the gunman, his accomplices or conspirators to contact us in absolute confidence.

'Whether you have overheard someone talking about this before or since it happened, saw the car being abandoned or know anything else, no matter how insignificant you think it might be, please get in touch.

'We will have extra officers in and around the area today and across the weekend and if anyone wants to provide information about this or has any concerns please come and talk to us.'

John Aldridge, 50, who runs John's Barber Shop, next door to the pub, said he had been running his business there for 29 years.

He said: 'It's worrying. You try to keep it in the back of your mind to be honest.'

His business was forced to close for the day while police forensic teams carried out their investigations.

Another neighbour, 84, said he was now moving out of the area.

'It's bad, considering it's right on your doorstep,' he added.

Floral tributes left at the scene read: 'To Mark. Rest in peace. Love and miss you always. Amanda Joyce.xxxx', while another said: 'Bye Mark. So sad. May you have a bed in heaven. All my love. Teresa Joyce. xxxx'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
