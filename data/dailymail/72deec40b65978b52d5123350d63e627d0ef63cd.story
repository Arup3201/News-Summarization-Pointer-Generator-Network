Madam: Symington provided girls she recruited to work at two exclusive apartments with contraceptives and a variety of sex toys

A madam has been convicted of running a 'high class' brothel from luxury penthouse flats close to the waterside homes of Premier League footballers.

Suzanna Symington, 29, recruited girls to work at two apartments in the exclusive Ocean Village Marina, in Southampton, Hampshire.

She provided them with accommodation, security cameras and a video intercom along with contraceptives and a variety of sex toys.

Prosecutor David Jenkins told Southampton Crown Court the 'very high class set up' offered a variety of services from escorting to full sex.

Judge Nigel Pascoe sentenced her to seven months in prison, suspended for a year, and fined her £250.

He told her: 'In life there are sometimes turning points.

'You may like to consider that not going to prison today maybe the turning point in your life - but that is a matter for you.'

Prices at the brothel, known as Elite Devine Honeys, ranged from £80 for 'girlfriend experiences' to £2,000 for a full weekend.

Symington started off as a prostitute herself, working under the name Lucy Devine.

But her business was so successful she decided to expand into two flats, taking a cut of the girls' profits to pay the rent and utility bills.

She had dreamed of becoming a millionaire with a home in the sun, a swimming pool and even a book deal chronicling how she made her fortune, the court heard.

But police raided her brothel after four months in August last year, during which time the business is believed to have made almost £34,000.

Officers found a purse containing £13,410 in cash and a quantity of amphetamine.

Symington, of Southampton, said in police interview the drugs were for personal use to help her lose weight.

The court heard she began working as a prostitute when her gambler boyfriend left her with crippling debts.

Symington was convicted of controlling or managing a brothel for the use of prostitution and possessing criminal property.

The madam also admitted possessing a class B drug.

Toby Long, defending, said Symington had been 'disarmingly' honest and had co-operated with police.

He said her former boyfriend had all but coerced her into opening the brothels and had taken much of the profits she was making for himself.

Symington sat motionless in a figure-hugging black suit with animal print collar and cuffs throughout the court hearing.

She only flashed a smile when an online advert describing her as 'a young dark haired babe' who was 'perfect and perky' was read out.

Ocean Village is a luxurious development, with bars, restaurants, an arthouse cinema and a marina housing dozens of expensive yachts.

Houses on the development are regularly occupied by Premier League footballers from the nearby Southampton FC.

There is no suggestion that any of those players used the brothel.
