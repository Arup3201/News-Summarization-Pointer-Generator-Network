Authorities searching for answers in yesterday's pot rally shooting panic have released a Youtube video that includes footage of a man they believe was involved.

According to Denver police, there are likely two suspects, only one of whom is seen in the video.

'We
are seeking this individual as we believe he assisted the primary 
suspect after the shooting,' said Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson.
'He is the black male with a brown and white checkered shirt'

Panic struck the gathering of some 
80,000 marijuana smokers in Denver early Saturday when gun shots rang 
out and two revelers were left with bullet wounds. Thousands of others 
were sent running for their lives.

Suspect: Police believe this man is one of at least two behind the gunshots that caused the 4/20 pot rally panic in Denver

Police
reportedly spent Sunday morning poring over video footage from the 4/20
celebration in the hopes of finding the culprit and had posted the 
Youtube footage, under the title 'Denver 420 Rally Shooting Crowd and 
Interviews' by Sunday afternoon.

Denver police have turned the case over to their gang unit, but Jackson told the Denver Post it is not yet clear if the crime was gang-related.

'They have their ears to the ground and take care of this sort of thing,' Jackson said.

One bystander said there was no room for doubt in the matter.

'It
was absolutely gang-related,' said Andrew Lindsley, who told the Denver
Post he watched as two men strode 'aggressively through the crowd' just
before shots were heard. 

Worse fear: Tens of thousands ran in fear after several shots were heard fired and some cried that an explosion had gone off according to witnesses

Emergency response: Denver Paramedics, police officers and good samaritans work to help a shooting victim Civic Center Park in Denver on Saturday during the 4/20 pot rally

Prepared: One of the two victims is seen carried away from the scene that was heavily staffed by law enforcement officers and paramedics in light of Monday's bombing at the Boston Marathon

The witnesses and other celebrants, meanwhile, were still wracked from the Boston
Marathon bombing that killed three on Monday, and described mixed recounts 
of what they heard, some saying they heard three shots fired while 
others saying up to eight.

'We were standing just in front of the 
stage when we heard three loud pops, we don't know what it was, we 
couldn't see anything, and right away people started stampeding and 
running towards us, knocking booths over,' event goer Sarina Romero told
KDVR.

'That was when we 
saw police running toward it, guns drawn, 15-20 police officers all 
heading in that direction where the shots came from in front of the 
music stage, right in the center of the crowd,' she said.

'Some people
were yelling "explosion," some people were yelling, "gunshots." We 
couldn't really find if it was coming from the stage or from the side 
because there were just so many people literally just running at 
people,' a witness named Kyle told 7News.

Panic: As many as 80,000 marijuana smokers ran for their lives in Denver after shots rang out ultimately injuring at least two people

Injuries: One victim was shot in the leg and another sustained unknown injuries at Civic Center Park as tens of thousands celebrated the counterculture holiday known as 4/20

Laura Forduno who was one of the thousands running from the scene told the Denver Post she saw one of the victims lying on a street corner.

'There was a gentleman on the floor, lying there, and he was not moving,' Forduno said. 'It was chaos.'

Dean Zimmerman told the paper that he
was one of a few who stopped to help the man after he appeared to have 
been shot in his left thigh.

'I was talking to him, telling him, you're gonna be OK, you're gonna be OK,' Zimmerman said.

He says the man appeared calm, and even 'cool about it,' in Zimmerman's words.

With a nation on edge following 
Monday's attack, the city reported having ample security on hand for 
Saturday's festivities, including a police force on motorcycles, horses 
and undercover who were joined by private security, volunteers and 
paramedics.

Police said 
earlier this week they're especially focused on crowd security in light 
of the attacks that killed three at the Boston finish line.

'We're aware of the events in 
Boston,' said Denver police spokesman Aaron Kafer, who declined to give 
specifics about security measures being taken. 'Our message to the 
public is that, if you see something, say something.'

'It was in the back of my head,' one event goer told KDVR of his initial worry of coming out today.

Saturday was the first 4/20 celebration since Colorado and Washington made pot legal for recreation use.

Reggae
music filled the air, and so did the smell of marijuana, as celebrants 
gathered by mid-morning in a park just beside the state Capitol. Few 
police were initially in sight, though public marijuana use is still 
prohibited here.

'People aren't afraid to come out and celebrate it, the way they used to be,' said 52-year-old Charles Bade of Denver.

Bade carried a tie-dyed flag with a 
big cannabis leaf and wore a garland of fake marijuana leaves around his
neck. He said he's been marking 4/20 privately since he was 11 but 
decided to join this year's public smoke-out to celebrate the votes by 
Colorado and Washington last year to defy federal drug law and make pot 
legal.

Authorities generally look the other way at public pot smoking here on April 20.

Organizers say the event — which drew
50,000 people last year — could bring a record 80,000 this year, since 
it's the first celebration since Colorado and Washington voted to make 
pot legal for recreational use.

Packed: The city expected up to 80,000 people to pack this park on Saturday with the crowd and smoke seen covering it from end-to-end before shots rang out

Taken over: Members of a crowd numbering tens of thousands smoke marijuana and listen to live music, at the Denver 420 pro-marijuana rally that took over Civic Center Park

4/20: April 20th has for years been a celebration of marijuana counterculture, and the 2013 Denver rally draw larger crowds than previous years

Group
smoke-outs were also planned Saturday from New York to San Francisco. 
The origins of the number '420' as a code for pot are murky, but the 
drug's users have for decades marked the date 4/20 as a day to use pot 
together.

Denver's 
celebration this year also featured the nation's first open-to-all 
Cannabis Cup, a marijuana competition patterned after one held in 
Amsterdam.

Similar
to a beer or wine festival, pot growers compete for awards for taste, 
appearance and potency of their weed. Denver's event, sponsored by High 
Times magazine, has sold more than 5,000 tickets.

Snoop
Lion, the new reggae- and marijuana-loving persona of the rapper better
known as Snoop Dogg, received a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from High 
Times. And the hip-hop group Cypress Hill was set to perform a sold-out 
concert Saturday evening in Colorado's iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

Colorado and Washington are still 
waiting for a federal response to the votes and are working on setting 
up commercial pot sales, which are still limited to people with certain 
medical conditions. In the meantime, pot users are free to share and use
the drug in small amounts.

A
citizen advocacy group that opposes marijuana legalization, Smart 
Colorado, warned in a statement that public 4/20 celebrations 'send a 
clear message to the rest of the nation and the world about what 
Colorado looks like.'

'Does
the behavior of the participants in these events reflect well on our 
state?' asked the head of Smart Colorado, Henny Lasley.

The
organizer of Denver's 4/20 rally, Miguel Lopez, said the holiday is 
more than an excuse to get high — it's also a political statement by 
people who want to see the end of marijuana prohibition.

'You
don't have to smoke weed to go to 4/20 rallies. You don't have to be 
gay to go to a Pride festival. You don't have to be Mexican to celebrate
Cinco de Mayo,' Lopez said.

'That's what this is. It's a celebration, it's a statement about justice and freedom and this movement.'
