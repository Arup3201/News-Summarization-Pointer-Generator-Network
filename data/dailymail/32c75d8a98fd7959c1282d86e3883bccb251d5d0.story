A mother has been arrested after she allegedly forced her young daughter to take pornographic photographs of her to send to her inmate fiancé.

Jodi Roberts, from Wabash Valley, Indiana, is facing a federal charge of conducting a performance harmful to minors after making her nine-year-old child take naked pictures of her in sexually graphic poses, authorities said.

Roberts' actions were discovered when prison guards opened a letter containing the lewd pictures that was addressed to her fiancé Jeremiah LaMaster last week.
