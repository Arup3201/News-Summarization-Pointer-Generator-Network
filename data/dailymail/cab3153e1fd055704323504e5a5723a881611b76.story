Forget beard baubles, one man has turned his lengthy facial hair into a Christmas tree, an octopus, a snowman and even a bowl for eating noodle soup.

Isaiah Webb, 30, from San Francisco, has found fame on the internet as Incredibeard, a hirsute and highly creative beard sculptor who says he's 'a simple man on an extraordinary mission'.

He hasn't shaved for 16 years and relies on strong styling paste and his wife's imagination to turn his beard - which extends far below his chest - into bizarre works of art.

Let it snow: On the first day of #Decembeard, Webb created jaunty Fudgy the BeardMan out of his facial hair

Webb, the man behind the Incredibeard persona, posts pictures of his sculpted facial hair on Tumblr and Instagram every Monday under the hashtag #Monbeardday.

Recent beard sculptures include a natty outsize bow tie, an upside-down octopus clutching at his face and for Thanksgiving last month, a cornucopia filled with harvested vegetables.

Each week fans write to Webb suggesting ever more outlandish and voluminous sculptures he could create with his beard. 

This has resulted in some mindboggling creations including a ramen noodle bowl, called the Big Bowl O'Beard Ramen - which he says is one of his favourites - and holders for five beer cups beneath his chin.

Webb said he hasn't been clean-shaven in about 16 years and his beard has been left to grow for the past two years.

Earlier this year he told Mashable that the decorative displays are a team effort. He designs the creations and wife Aphan styles them.

In fact, it was his wife who urged him to grow his beard and pursue this unusual undertaking.

'[My wife] was really the one that kept pushing me to grow a beard, then to grow it out long. She is at the heart of Incredibeard,' he said.

'I may come up with the different beard design ideas, but she is the one that styles everything. She brings the beard art to life. Incredibeard would be nothing without her.'

The Woodsman moustache wax and beard oil from Texas-based grooming company The Bearded Bastard are all he needs to help shape his facial hair.

Kate, 11, a subscriber of News-O-Matic's online children's magazine, asked him to mould this bearded bow tie

'Like a moth drawn to the flame, this beard can't stay away from my face,' says Isaiah of this geometric style

He received many requests for this uncannilly accurate Batman design, called The Bane of My Beardxistence

He said: 'The greatest and most profound thing a man can do is grow a beard. 

'A real beard (one not grown from hormonal imbalance or steroids) is as unique to men as childbearing is to women.

'To truly understand this, you must grow your beard out for at least six months. After six months, the beard will feel just like a child. 

'You'll even start having nightmares of shaving it off by accident. After six months, you'll never want to be alone - I mean clean-shaven - again.'
