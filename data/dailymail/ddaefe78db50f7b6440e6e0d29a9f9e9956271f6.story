A north Florida mayor who is in jail on drug charges has resigned from office.

Hampton Mayor, Barry Layne Moore, was suspended from office in November and is being held in the Bradford County Jail on allegations of selling oxycodone.

Moore was suspended from office in November and submitted his resignation on Tuesday. He has not posted $4,500 bail.

Resigned: The city's mayor Barry Layne Moore was arrested for allegedly trying to sell an oxycodone tablet to an undercover officer around Thanksgiving. He remains in jail unable to cover the $4,500 bond

Uncertain future: The tiny town of Hampton in northern Florida could be wiped off the map after an audit showed city officials have mishandled town funds to a comical degree

Officials say Moore asked city councilman Bill Goodge, who is a sergeant at the jail, to help him with the resignation.

Goodge says Moore didn't want to 'embarrass' the city any more.

The
 decision allows the city to move forward with an election. Acting Mayor
 Myrtice McCullough has been running the city since November.

Moore's arrest came just weeks after he was elected. The city has 500 residents.

'I ride a bicycle around town. I had 
my lights cut off twice last year. If I am a dope dealer, why are my 
lights getting cut off,' Moore asked CNN in an interview from jail.

'I'm a good guy that got caught up in a bunch of nonsense that was bigger than me.'

Moore has been in jail since around Thanksgiving because he can't afford the $4,500 bond.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott immediately suspended Moore after his arrest, but the mayor submitted his official letter of resignation on Tuesday,

His letter was short, and to the point.

'I, Barry Layne Moore, being of sound mind and body, ask that you would please accept this letter as notification that I am leaving my position with the city of Hampton, effective immediately.'

Moore's arrest, which came just weeks after he had taken office, isn't the only thing that has drawn attention to Hampton, a 1-square-mile city of less than 500 people in Bradford County.

Low hanging fruit: There aren't many people in sleepy Hampton, but its location along a busy highway made it the perfect speed trap town

A state 
audit found 31 violations of the city's charter, and violations of 
federal codes and laws and a shocking misuse of funds in the tiny town.

$132,000 was spent at  the BP convenience store next door to City Hall.

'What's
 wrong with that picture?' Jim Mitzel, mayor from 2000 to 2008, asked 
CNN. 'That's a lot of cigarettes and beer and what-have-you. That's 
corrupt as heck.'

They also found that city employees 
had racked up $27,000 in charges on the city's credit card for 'no 
public purpose' and that the city police cars weren't even insured.

Though, there were plenty of them.

The
 city keeps a bloated police force in order to continue pursuing what 
many say is its sole purpose: ticketing drivers as they drive through 
town.

The town has even 
extended its city limits 1,260 feet down the width of a busy highway in 
order to lay claim to any and all traffic violations--end their 
accompanying ticket fines--that occur there.

The
 sight of Hampton Police sitting alongside U.S. 301 on lawn chairs and 
pointing their radar gun at passersby bas become the norm on the 
outskirts of town.

They
 became infamous for ticketing anyone and everyone they possibly could 
for even the tiniest of infractions and between 2010 and 2012 raked in 
an unbelievable $616,960 in fines.

Beginning of the end: The town became infamous for all the speeding tickets it issued an between 2010 and 2012, the city collected over $600,000 in fines. But the state would soon want to know where all the money went

The money allowed them to upgrade their police cars to SUVs and check drivers' speed while wearing pricey riot gear.

One such police officer became known 
by the nickname Rambo because of his swagger and the AR-15 rifle he wore
 while greeting vacationing speeders during traffic stops.

'It
 became 'serve and collect' instead of 'serve and protect.' Cash 
register justice,' local Sheriff Gordon Smith told CNN. 'Do y'all 
remember the old Dukes of Hazzard? Boss Hogg? They make Boss Hogg look 
like a Sunday school teacher.'

To save themselves further 
headache, state officials--including State Senator Rob Bradley, whose 
district includes Hampton--say they just want the town erased from the 
map.

'It’s like something out of a Southern Gothic novel,' Bradley told Time.

That's a lot of cigarettes: Pictured is the Hampton town hall. Not pictured is the BP convenience store next door where city officials managed to rack up a  $132,000 tab

Bradley
 said the support to wipe away the mistakes of Hampton's past is strong 
with area Floridians as well as in the legislature.

'This
 town exists apparently just to write speeding tickets,' Bradley said. 
'Most people don’t understand why it exists in the first place.'

The
 city is also looking to hire a new city clerk and maintenance operator,
 and it has been receiving applications for those positions.

Many residents believe the difficult times are now behind the city and that the community just needs to move forward.

Police in shiny new cruisers toting top-of-the-line guns and combat gear purchased with ticket money would often hide behind this Dumpster. Only, some of those cars weren't even insured

Hampton, Florida has been a town for 89 years, but its notoriety as a ruthless speed trap may soon be its undoing.
