Smiling in the sunshine and brandishing assault rifles, they were brothers in arms.

Siblings Akram and Mohamed Sebah are the latest Britons to be killed waging jihad in Syria’s brutal civil war.

Akram, 24, was a London estate agent who travelled with 28-year-old Mohamed to the country’s increasingly bloody battlefields.

Now they have become the new poster boys for Al Qaeda, which is boasting of their ‘martyrdom’ to recruit more Western fighters.

They
 have been dubbed ‘Lions of Britain’ by fellow jihadists who have 
published their photograph on social media sites popular with 
extremists.

Yesterday the brothers’ distraught father said they had travelled to Syria without telling any of their family.

Akram, 24, who worked for Ludlow Thompson was described by neighbours as 'well-mannered'

Abdulrahman
 Sebah, 62, of Holloway, North London, said: ‘No father or mother wishes
 their children to go to hell, or to whatever you call Syria.

'If someone
 goes there, absolutely 100 per cent they don’t come back.'

A year ago, Akram, who has a biomedical sciences degree, was working as an estate agent in London.

His Facebook page contains photographs showing him enjoying himself on nights out with colleagues.

One shows him with his arm around a female colleague as they celebrate their sales team ‘smashing their target again!’.

A neighbour told the Mail yesterday: ‘He and his brother were always very nice, with good manners.’

Scotland
 Yard fears more than 300 Britons have swapped ordinary lives in the UK 
to go to Syria and fight with groups affiliated to Al Qaeda.

Yesterday, 
radical Islamic cleric Anjem Choudary claimed thousands of British 
Muslims had done so.

The 
Sebah brothers died in unknown circumstances last September, but in the 
past few weeks have achieved notoriety online as their photograph has 
been circulated among admirers.

It shows them clad in military fatigues 
and armed with assault rifles.

An
 internet posting claimed they were fighting with Al Qaeda-linked groups
 Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.

The brothers are local to Finsbury Park Mosque, where hate preacher Abu Hamza went to pray (pictured)

Hamza famously led an outdoor prayer in the north London street surrounded by dozens of police officers

Akram
 studied biomedical sciences at Westminster University from 2008 to 
2011, and worked part time at Marks & Spencer, according to his 
LinkedIn profile.

He joined estate agent Ludlow Thompson, where 
customers gave him positive reviews, with one writing online: ‘He gives 
estate agents a good name.’

He
 later joined Cherry Pick People, a recruitment firm which headhunts 
estate agents, and whose director Alex Wiffen told the Sunday Times: ‘He
 was a really nice guy.’

Mohamed
 Sebah studied for his A-levels at City and Islington College and is 
believed to have later taught English in Saudi Arabia.

A
 neighbour of the family, who are of Eritrean descent and live in a 
housing association house in Holloway, said: ‘We found out they had died
 four months ago, but we were told they had died in a car crash in 
America.’
