A British tourist whose leg was severed when a New York taxi driver lost control and pinned her against a wall is now out of intensive care.

Sian Green, 23, has started rehabilitation for her injuries following the crash in late August. Her lawyer said leaving the ICU ward Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan's Kips Bay, and beginning her rehabilitation marked a 'milestone in her recovery'. Lawyer Daniel Marchese also said Ms Green was in good spirits, according to NBC New York.

Miss Green, from Leicester, was starting a holiday in the Big Apple with her friend Keshia Warren, when the horrific incident happened. The girls were eating hot dogs outside the Rockefeller Centre, on Sixth Avenue, when the unlicensed yellow cab driver mounted the curb and crushed her.

On holiday: Sian Green, right, is now beginning rehab and has left the intensive care unit after her leg was severed when a taxi mounted the pavement in Manhattan, New York City, last month. She was eating a hot dog dog with friend Keshia Warren, left, on the first day of their holiday

Both her legs were severely injured; one was severed at the shin.

Taxi driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon, 24, has defended his actions, saying 'it's not my fault,' it's just accident'. (sic)

He has argued that he accelerated away from cyclist, Kenneth Olivo, 'who attacked his vehicle' because he was afraid he was going to be assaulted.

Olivo, 40, of Manhattan, had recently spent 10 days in jail after pleading guilty in April to menacing after accidentally kicking a dog and then telling the owner's friend that he would 'kill you and your family'.

He also has been arrested at least 24 times in the past - but has not been charged over the incident that saw driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon injure the part-time model Miss Green.

Investigation: Tourists, locals and police officers around the taxi that jumped a curb in Manhattan on Tuesday

Pained: Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon speaks to 
the cameras outside Bellevue hospital today as he gave a brief press 
conference to point the finger of blame at the cyclist involved in 
Tuesdays horror smash and apologized to 23-year-old Sian Green

Solidarity: Alongside Himon was Fernando Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers

The 24-year-old cabbie was not licensed to drive the cab he was using and was originally said to have been arguing with a cyclist when he tried to step on the brake but hit the accelerator instead.

Initial action was taken by the Taxi and Limousine Commission to suspend his licence, and although he only got a summons after the accident, he could eventually be given felony charges.

The incident happened on August 20 and Miss Green, a fashion buyer graduate from De Montfort University, has been in intensive care ever since.

After the crash, her friend Miss Warren wept as she desperately tried to stem the flow of blood from Miss Green’s legs with a passer-by’s dog leash.

A plumber, David Justino, used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet while a pizza truck owner raced to put her severed foot on ice.

US celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known as Dr Oz, rushed to help from his nearby studio when he heard the crash.

Miss
 Green – who said she was determined not to let the injuries ruin her 
life - was taken to Bellevue Hospital in New York where she is now 
beginning her rehab.

Mr Justino, 44, said Miss Green was a ‘strong girl, a brave girl’.

‘From the shin down, it was gone,’ he added. ‘He hit the girl, she flew up in the air.

‘Her
 left leg was severed, the other was mangled. So I just grabbed my belt,
 went over, lifted her up, put it on, held it. She was conscious the 
whole time, the poor thing. I wished she had passed out.’

Himon
 he told the New York Post after the incident: ‘He was in my way and I 
got upset, so I gave him notice that I wanted to pass through. He 
started pounding on my car with his hands and was yelling things at me.

Smash: Police in New York are looking into the incident but have not yet brought any formal charges

Blame Game: Himon says that Kenneth Olivo was physically threatening him moments before the smash and that caused him to accelerate away out of fear - ultimately causing the horrific accident

‘I
 suddenly felt like I had to get out of there. It was becoming a bad 
situation. So I accelerated to get in front of him. I don’t know how, 
but I just lost control of the car. I was in shock.

‘When
 I crashed, I didn’t even see the lady. At first, I didn’t think I hit 
anyone, then I saw her foot by my car... I need a more suitable job. 
There’s too much stress when you’re driving in the city.’

Distraught: Miss Green's best friend Keshia Warren is pictured at the scene in Manhattan on Tuesday

In
 a rather unusual press conference outside the hospital in the days 
after the crash, the taxi driver, Himon, originally from Bangladesh, 
said he was 'very, very sorry' adding 'I'm always going to pray for her.
 I wish her good luck'.

Miss
 Green’s parents Jason and Sonia said their daughter was ‘being very 
strong’ after the crash and she was starting to come to terms with what 
had happened.

At their 
semi-detached family home in Leicester, locksmith Mr Green, 42, said:  
‘She is in recovery now and they have had to amputate what’s left of her
 foot

‘Her friend Keshia is 
still in shock. We are a really close family, we are all devastated by 
what has happened. We just want to be at our daughter’s side.’

They flew to New York along with Miss Green’s boyfriend William Lord.

His father William Donaghue revealed that Miss Green had managed to speak to her boyfriend on the phone following the accident.

‘Sian
 is as upbeat as you can be about this,’ he said. ‘She is determined to 
not let this ruin her life. It’s such a tragic thing.’

Miss
 Green’s aunt Hayley Bennett added: ‘It’s just so terrible. The family’s
 grief-stricken,’ and her sister Rebecca, a model, said: ‘It’s such a 
shock. We’re devastated. What happened is awful but thankfully she’s in 
good hands.’

Miss Green, who worked at Hugo Boss  in Leicester, was also in the running to become Miss Leicester.

Last year in her application to a beauty contest, 5ft 5in Miss Green wrote in the 'talents' section: ‘I have danced since the age of 10 and joined a dancing agency at the age of 16.

'With the agency I was also taught how to stilt walk which I really enjoy. I'm also trying to set up a modelling career.’

She added: ‘I consider myself a very creative person, so my ambition is to have my own line of underwear, which I am currently designing for.'

'Sian is as upbeat as you can be about this. She is determined to not let this ruin her life. It’s such a tragic thing'

William Donaghue, her boyfriend's father

Her manager at Hugo Boss, Paul Richards, said: ‘She’s a lovely girl and we’re all devastated here.’

Police in New York are looking into the incident but have not yet brought any formal charges.

Himon is originally from Bangladesh but now lives in the Bronx. The New York Post also revealed that the taxi driver injured a passenger in a crash in 2010, which was the first year he worked as a taxi driver in the city.

Later that year he was also fined $50 (£32), before getting nine points and $415 (£266) in fines for three violations in 2011. He ran a red light, did 65 in a 45mph zone and performed an illegal turn.
