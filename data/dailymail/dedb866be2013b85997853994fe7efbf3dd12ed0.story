After David Hasselhoff he's the world's most recognised lifeguard but Bondi Rescue's chief lifesaver Bruce 'Hoppo' Hopkins says it's not all fun in the sun, shark-spotting and getting chatted up by girls.

The 46-year-old grew up on Sydney's Bronte beach and got into lifesaving as a casual job when he was still at school.

Fast forward 23 years and he's performed thousands of rescues but says the scariest one was when they struggled with a semi-conscious snorkeller who was drowning and smashing onto the rocks at Bondi Beach.

It's a tough life, but someone's got to do it! Bondi Rescue's head lifesaver Bruce Hopkins details the famous crew's exploits in new book Stories From The Bondi Lifeguards which documents day-to-day life on the beach

And if it wasn't for his 23 years of lifesaving experience the struggling swimmer could have been a goner.

'I was working on Bondi Beach with Kerrbox (fellow lifeguard Rod 'Kerrbox' Kerr)', he tells the Daily Mail Australia.

'And a guy from Fiji or one of the islands had jumped off the rocks to go snorkelling but the surf was huge and he was just getting smashed around. 

'His wife had called us, terrified, and he was struggling to stay up because he kept getting pulled under and thrown into the rocks and as soon as we got there I knew we were in trouble.

'We'd gone out with tubes, flippers and a rescue board each and he was a big guy, around 130 kilos and kept sinking the board. He was in a bad way and at times only semi conscious.

'We had to keep swapping the rescue boards and then putting the tubes around him to try and stop him getting bashed from the impact. It was touch and go and took us a long time, about 30 minutes.

'That's when 23 years of experience comes in as that split-second decision can mean life or death, and if it was one of the younger guys it could have been a very different outcome.' 

The Bondi Rescue boys, who start filming season 10  next month, shot to stardom in 2006 with their first series on Network Ten and it's a massive hit worldwide.

Series 10 starts filming in December and they released a book this weekend, Stories From The Bondi Lifeguards, which details their lives and  day-to-day responsibilities of the beach. 

'It's like herding cattle!' Hoppo says the worst thing about his job is when people don't swim between the flags

The stars of the book are Hoppo and his mates, Rod, Anthony 'Harries' Carroll, Trent 'Maxi' Maxwell, Andrew 'Reidy' Reid,  and tells of the hilarious  pranks they play on each other.

Like the time they set up an unwitting Maxi and trainee Harrison Reid for a penalty shoot-out against one of the world's top soccer players, Italian Alessandro Del Piero.

The lifeguards have also rescued actor Hugh Jackman's children from the ocean and tell how they were paid an impromptu visit from Mr Baywatch himself, David Hasselhoff.

'We put the uniform on him and he thought he was back in Baywatch,' laughs Bruce. 'He's massive, about 6ft 5, and very funny.

'He really enjoyed it and was telling us a few stories about his Baywatch. Sadly no Pamela Anderson though - we're still waiting for her to come down!'

The lifeguards don't get paid for the show but have been able to supplement their  salary from promotional spin-offs and appearances, and 'Hoppo' travels the world as a water safety consultant.

'What keeps me in the job is the lifestyle and you get to meet a lot of people travelling around the world from different cultures, he adds.

'I was in Dubai and an Iraqi guy came up to me. He was beside himself, saying excitedly, 'I can't believe I've met you.' Apparently the show 's very popular in Iraq, which just blows me away.

'And it definitely helps when I go overseas as I get a lot of water safety consulting in India and Japan so I already understand some of heir culture.' 

Bondi Beach is Sydney's biggest tourist attraction after the Opera House and Bruce says the most annoying thing about the job is when people don't swim in between the flags.

'Sometimes we can have 45,000 people on the beach and instead of swimming between the flags they'll be like, 'oh, that spot looks nice and calm, I'll go over there,' but that's where the rips are.

'We try and educate them but when you're dealing with that many people it's impossible to have them all swimming in between the flags anyway so it's a bit like herding cattle!' 

For anyone planning to head to Bondi this summer, father-of-two Bruce says the northern part of the beach is safest because, 'the rips pull a lot harder down south.'

Although he's heading towards his fifth decade Bruce, who also does a lot of yoga to stay supple and strong, says he'll stay in the job as long as his body holds up but also has other projects.

In September he launched Bondi Rescue HQ, a juice bar at the north beach which he hopes to turn it into a franchise a few years down the line.

'It's good to have alternatives,' he adds. 'The lifestyle's great and I've been doing this 23 years with my best friends but you're only as good a lifeguard as your body allows.

'I used to race a lot in my 20's and 30's which kept me fit but now it's maintaining it so I've had to change my routine a little bit.

'I probably don't do as much swimming and paddling as I used to but I now mix it up with yoga now and whatever else is needed.'

Because the job is so tough and physically demanding - not to mention dangerous - Bruce says it's not something he'd encourage his two daughters, Lauren, 16 and Georgia, 12, to go into.

I'm not going to push my daughters into anything,' he says. 'I'm here to guide them but if they were to say they wanted to start going into it now I would be concerned and try and steer them away.'

Do hassle the Hoff! The former Baywatch star appeared in episode 3 of series 6 and according to Hoppo is, 'massive, about 6ft 5, and very funny. We put the uniform on him and he thought he was back in Baywatch'

Bondi has only had a few female lifeguards and former World Junior Surfing Champion Nicola Atherton is the current one. 'We're all for female life guards,' he says. 

'But we don't get that many applying. I think it takes a certain person to come into that culture and obviously it's extremely physically demanding. 

'Nicola has just come from the pro-surfing tour and has surfed all around the world so she really knows the ocean and is extremely strong. And she can hold her own.'

In Stories From The Bondi Lifeguards Anthony 'Harries' Carroll talks about the first time he came face-to-face with a shark, just before the TV show started.

'When Kerrbox and I were working on the first pilot,' he writes. 'A guy knocked on the door and said, 'look I have just seen a massive shark out at the point there.'  'I said 'oh yeah?

'Well it's a seal probably'. We get a lot of seals around here. With my luck it may be a mermaid! Or it might have been a dolphin. 

'He said, 'Look mate, I have been around here a long time, and I surf and I fish, and this one is massive'. Then people started ringing into the tower.  

'I'm not going to push my daughters into anything,' Bruce, pictured here with Lauren and Georgia, says. 'But if they were to say they wanted to start going into it now I would be concerned as it's so physically tough'

'The guys on the cameras got really excited – wow they were going to get a shark in the first show!

'So I went out on the jet ski and couldn't see anything for half an hour. All I could see were about 100 people on the headland screaming at me and pointing at the ocean. 

'Then I saw the fin come up – it was around 18-foot and it was a Great White – they got a shot of it and the shot went international. Then we got the show two days later! Surprise surprise!

Unsurprisingly Bruce is against the shark-culling that the government trialed earlier this year after a spate of attacks, saying: 'Obviously it's very tragic when a shark attack happens.

'But more people in Australia die from bee-stings than shark attacks. They don't search out humans, it usually happens when they are chasing food and it's been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'The more sharks you take out of the water affects the ocean, which affects the food chain and everything else. Each time we go into the water we're guests in their playground, their environment.'

He's done thousands of rescues but one where a snorkeller was getting smashed against the rocks was the scariest

It took Bruce and fellow lifeguard and friend Rod 'Kerrbox' Kerr 30 minutes to rescue the semi conscious man and get him back to shore

@highlight

It was 'touch and go' because he kept sinking the surfboard, and if it was a less experienced lifeguard carrying out the rescue the man could have died
