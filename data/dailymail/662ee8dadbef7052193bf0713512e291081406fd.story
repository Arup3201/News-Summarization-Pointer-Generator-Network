The owners of DiGiorno - the nation's largest frozen pizza company - have said that they have cut all ties with a Wisconsin dairy farm after undercover video revealed sickening abuse against the cows kept there.

The footage, shot by animals rights group Mercy for Animals last month, shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm in Greenleaf, beating the cows and dragging them with ropes from tractors - leaving them with gaping, bleeding wounds.

Nestlé, who owns DiGiorno frozen pizza, confirmed today that they will no longer use any use cheese for their pizza from any firm supplied with milk by Wiese Brothers - as it emerged that the Wisconsin firm has fired two staff and that police are investigating the family firm.

Swiss food giant Nestlé moved quickly to sever any links between them and Wiese Brothers and a spokesperson for their pizza division said they are 'outraged and deeply saddened by the mistreatment of animals shown in this video.'

They confirmed that they have instructed their cheese supplier, Foremost Farms USA, that Nestlé 'will not accept any cheese made with milk from the Wiese Brothers Farm.'

After viewing the horrific video which shows cows hanging from ropes and blistered with seeping sores, Foremost Farms USA declared themselves to be 'extremely disappointed.'

'To protect consumer trust and confidence in the dairy industry, we have discontinued receiving milk from the farm depicted in the video.'

Faced with a public relations disaster, the Wiese family said that they were 'shocked and saddened' at the footage and added they have 'zero tolerance for animal abuse.'

They confirmed that the two employees seen in the video had been fired and a third removed from 'animal handling' responsibilities.

'Further action will be taken if the investigation warrants it,' said the statement.

The local sheriff's department in Greenleaf said that they are investigating the alleged abuse and will be pressing charges if warranted.

The video was shot undercover by a representative of the animal rights group Mercy for Animals in October and November and was then handed over to NBC News.

'No socially responsible corporation should support dairy operations that beat, kick, mutilate and neglect animals,' said MFA’s executive director, Nathan Runkle.

'Due to its complete lack of meaningful animal welfare standards, DiGiorno has allowed a culture of cruelty to flourish in its cheese supply chain.'

The gruesome video reveals repeated examples of cruelty towards the livestock at Wiese Brothers farm as bleeding animals are beaten with sticks or kicked and dragged by their legs or necks.

Speaking to NBC News, one livestock expert said the video showed unequivocal evidence of abuse.

'Dragging live cows, and completely suspending them with the cow lift is severe animal abuse,' said Temple Grandin, an associate professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University and an animal welfare adviser to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

'The actions of these people went beyond rough handling and escalated to the level of cruelty. Kicking, beating, and hard whipping of downed cows is abusive.'

Brown County Shefiff's Department said they were in the midst of an investigation after being handed the footage.

'It something we’re looking into right now,' said Captain David Konrath.

'At the conclusion of the investigation we’ll give the case to the district attorney and he will make a decision about whether charges would be filed.'

Pizza and the farm: DiGiorno is the most popular brand of pizza in the United States and the milk its cheese suppliers use comes from Wiese Brothers

A Wiese family spokesperson said that they were working fully with Brown County Sheriff's Department and had invited an 'independent animal care auditor from a national evaluation firm' to come to their facility and begin a review of practices within 24 hours of being made aware of the footage in on November 26.

'We are shocked and saddened to see a few of our employees not following our farm's policies for proper animal care. We have zero tolerance for animal abuse. We are committed to providing optimal care and ask all our employees to demonstrate ongoing respect for every animal at all times,' the farm said.

The farm, which has 4,500 cows that produce about 350,000 pounds of milk daily, was chosen at random to investigate.
