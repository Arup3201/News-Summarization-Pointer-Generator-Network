Google is developing special versions of it's most popular products for children, it has revealed.

The firm hopes that a child friendly version of YouTube and its chrome browser could make the internet safer for youngsters.

It says it is aiming the news products at under twelves. 

Google hopes its new products will make it easier - and safer- for children to use the web.

A recent study said the iPad has now overtaken household names such as McDonalds and Disney to become the number one brand among American 6-12 year olds.

The annual study, conducted by leading youth and family research firm Smarty Pants, ranks more than 250 brands each year. 

 

'The big motivator inside the company is everyone is having kids, so there's a push to change our products to be fun and safe for children,' Pavni Diwanji, the vice president of engineering charged with leading the new initiative, told USA Today.

'We expect this to be controversial, but the simple truth is kids already have the technology in schools and at home,' says the mother of two daughters, ages 8 and 13. 

'So the better approach is to simply see to it that the tech is used in a better way.' 

Google is developing the products in a secret room at its Mountain View,'Googleplex' called the Kids Studio. 

Diwanji said her own daughter was part of the test group, and has already given the team some guidance after  Googling 'trains' and seeing a list of Amtrak train schedules pop up.

'She came to me and said, 'Mommy, you should tell Google about Thomas the Tank Engine, because Google obviously doesn't know about him,'' Diwanji said.

Although Google has not said which products will be released, it is believe search, youTube and Chrome are the most likely.

It comes as youngsters increase have their own tablets to play on.

'iPad's number one status among kids represents the culmination of the 'tablet takeover' – a movement from shared screens and TV network dominance to curated content on personal devices,' said Wynne Tyree, president of Smarty Pants.

'Kids increasingly turn to iPad for games, TV shows, videos, books, homework help and communicating with friends and family.'

In the firm's 2014 study, Apple's iPad trumps iconic kid brands such as McDonald's, Toys'R'Us, Nickelodeon, and Disney.
