Queen’s Park Rangers could effectively be thrown out of football over the next few years if they fail to pay an anticipated huge fine for breaking Football League financial fair play rules. 

That startling prospect was raised on Tuesday by the League’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, as he outlined ‘nuclear option’ possibilities of what could happen if QPR refuse to pay.

‘Theoretically, that is the position,’ Harvey said. ‘I would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered.’

Under Football League rules introduced in 2012 to encourage financial stability, clubs who make huge losses as they attempt to win promotion to the Premier League face a range of punishments.

If they overspend but don’t go up, they face transfer embargoes. If they overspend and do go up - as QPR overspent and went up last season - then they face huge fines.

The tariff system of fines is hugely complex but in the simplest terms, QPR face a fine of £1 for every £1 over £18 million that they lost in the 2013-14 season.

QPR’s losses for 2013-14 are not yet known. They lost £65.4m in 2012-13 and it is anticipated the figure will be around £60m in 2013-14, which could mean a fine of around £40m. They must let the League know the exact figure by 1 December.

QPR’s owner Tony Fernandes has said he will contest any fine, and perhaps even take legal action to try to avoid paying it.

Harvey, speaking to Sportsmail today at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, said he expects clubs to pay, and that sanctions up to and including not being allowed to play in the Football League would be applicable for non-payment.

QPR would not need to worry about this as long as they stayed in the Premier League. But as and when they were relegated at any stage in the future, whether that is next May, or next year or in a few years, they would face effective expulsion from league football because the League would not let them in.

‘Theoretically, that is the position,’ Harvey said. ‘I would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered. The one thing for certain is that most clubs [in the Premier League] will become a Football League club again.

‘Now QPR will of course be hoping it does not happen for some considerable number of seasons. But the chances they will need to return to the Football League fold at some point in the future. Certainly, three of the current 20 clubs that are in the Premier League will be in the Football League next season.’

Harvey hopes that any clubs needing to pay their fines will do so, QPR included. He also hopes that if they initially refuse, then football arbitration will be possible ahead of harsher action.

‘Football has a number of processes to try to keep its debates out of court and inside a tribunal system or arbitration system under the FA’s guise,’ Harvey said.

‘Ultimately, I believe the FA would have a part to play in terms of determining the outcome between a club and a league in which they are not currently playing.’

Originally the Football League wanted to take any fines levied on rule-breaking clubs and share them between clubs who stayed within the rules. The Premier League objected to that so now any fines will be given to charity.
