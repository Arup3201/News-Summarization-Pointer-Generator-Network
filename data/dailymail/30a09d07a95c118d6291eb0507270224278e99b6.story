Middlesbrough hope to sign Tomas Kalas on loan from Chelsea when he returns from his spell with Cologne this week.

The 21-year-old centre-back has been a target for QPR also but is interested in joining up with Aitor Karanka at Boro as they push for a place in the Premier League. 

Chelsea have a good relationship with Middlesbrough where former chief executive Peter Kenyon is helping to advise with transfers.

Tomas Kalas will return from Cologne this week and Middlesbrough hope to sign him on loan

The Czech defender made his debut for Chelsea during the 2-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield last season

Striker Patrick Bamford is already on loan at Boro for the season as is Kenneth Omeruo, who featured at the World Cup with Nigeria last summer.

Kalas famously made his Premier League debut for Chelsea in the 2-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield last season, a result that dealt a major blow to the Reds' title aspirations.

But a lack of playing time in the Bundesliga could see the Czech Republic international return to England prematurely.
