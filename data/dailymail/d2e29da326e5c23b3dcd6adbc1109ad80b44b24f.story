Jose Mourinho has joked that the only thing stopping Eden Hazard from signing a new deal at Chelsea is the lack of a 'nice pen'.

Hazard's representatives and Blues officials have been locked in discussions for months over new five-year contract worth £200,000-per-week, but Mourinho isn't concerned about the wait.

He told GetWestLondon: 'I am buying a nice pen.

'I need a bit of time to go to Sloane Street and buy a proper pen. I just need time to buy the pen and after that I think there is not a long time to go!'

The Belgian winger has been in sensational form for Chelsea so far this season, scoring 13 goals in all competitions, and has shown no signs of wanting out of the Stamford Bridge club. 

Asked if he should be concerned, Mourinho added: 'Why? What's the problem? He has a contract with Chelsea for two or three more years, why should we be in a hurry? Are you worried? I'm not worried.' 

Mourinho's side face a Premier League clash against Everton on Wednesday night as the Blues look to take another step towards a first domestic title since the 2009-10 season.
