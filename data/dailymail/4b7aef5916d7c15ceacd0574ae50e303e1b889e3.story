For quirky cut out artist Alexander Korzer-Robinson a picture really is worth a thousand words.

Sentences and paragraphs are of little interest to the 37-year-old who instead cuts around different images from 150-year-old Victorian books and carefully pieces them together to create a brand new 3D art form.

The Bristol-based artist, originally from Leipzig in Germany, has created vivid, detailed collages that feature everything from old soldiers standing to attention to giant pink flamingos.

Intricate: From Boys Own adventure books to a History of the 19th Century artist Alexander Korzer-Robinso has turned old books into an art form

Works are created using only the pictures that are already in the volumes and the end result is a hollowed out book with a layered composition similar to the Victorian paper theatres that were hugely popular at that time.

The books are sealed around the cut so they can no longer be opened, but are designed to be either hung on the wall or can stand by themselves as an art object.

'Most of my piece are unframed, and have a pane behind the cover to protect the delicate contents.'

Mr Korzer Robinson has had his work exhibited in the UK and the U.S. and will be showing his work in Switzerland later this year.

Painstaking: The Bristol-based artist, decided to use antiquarian books to deconstruct our ideas of the past

He said he came up with the innovative design about five years ago. ‘I had been experimenting with paper art, trying out different avenues and making boxed paper constructions,’ he said.

'I used all sorts of printed paper for the construction, among them second hand books.

'It wasn’t a giant leap from the boxed art to using the actual book as the enclosure of its original content.

'But it took me about a year of trial and error to refine the technique into the cut books I makes these days.

'So it was really the result of a process of experimentation.

He started exhibiting the books about three years ago and he said it was his mission to deconstruct ideas of the past through his work.

'The three-dimensionality is something that draws people in initially,' he added.

'But for me the inspiration starts at the point of choosing a book to work on.

'Then as I work on the piece the planning part is conscious decisions about what I want to make out of the book.

'There are a lot of unconscious decisions and value judgements that come up in this dialogue with the medium.

'I try to allow for this element of an almost dreamlike forming of connections with the imagery.'
