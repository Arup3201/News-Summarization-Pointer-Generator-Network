A staggering 800 lottery tickets will be sold every second tomorrow ahead of a EuroMillions draw that will see 100 lucky Brits become millionaires.

Sales of the special EuroMillions 
Millionaire Raffle tickets are expected to reach more than three million 
tickets an hour as the public snap up their chance to win the life-changing sum.

And one lucky person will be catapulted into the ranks of the super-rich as the jackpot for the separate Euromillions draw is expected to top £105million.

Life-changing: Lottery winners Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington, 22, celebrate after winning £45,169,170.50 on EuroMillions jackpot in February. 100 people will become millionaires on Friday night

Organisers of the raffle have urged players to get their tickets early to be in with a 
chance of landing a windfall.

The previous record was set when 25 
millionaires were created in the EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle draw on
Christmas Eve in 2010.

The raffle is being organised to 
thank UK lottery players for helping to raise money for funding the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games. In total the National Lottery is contributing of £2.2billion to the Games.

The Friday night draw will be moved to a temporary slot on BBC from 11pm to 11.10pm, so it doesn't clash with the ceremony.

Winners: Gareth and Catherine Bull, from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, won £40,627,241 in the EuroMillions lottery draw and right, Dave Dawes and his wife Angela, whose haul was £101,203,600 last October

Over the past two years dozens of people have scooped life-changing wins but some have won considerably more than others.

A dozen bus drivers from Stagecoach bus depot in Corby, Northamptonshire also scooped £38million between them in March.

Last year, Colin and Christine Weir's 
numbers came in making them £161million richer and Britain's biggest 
EuroMillions winners.

The couple, who have more money than David and Victoria Beckham, bought an £850,000 mansion
in Largs, Ayrshire, last year, and plan on building a luxury indoor 
swimming pool and jacuzzi. 

They are also sponsoring 15-year-old 
Scottish racing driver Gregor Ramsay in his first season competing in 
European and Italian Formula Three events and two months ago it emerged that Mr 
Weir had pledged to give £750,000 to his local football team, Largs 
Thistle, to help them clear debts and improve their facilities.

The couple made a seven-figure 
donation to the Scottish National Party to support its campaign for 
Scotland to break away from the rest of the UK.

The biggest ever win was £195million won in 2002 by Andrew Whittaker, from West Virginia.

Elaine and Harold Messner from New Jersey shared the world’s largest lottery prize of £250m when they won the Mega Millions draw in March 2007. However, the prize was shared further with an anonymous truck driver from Georgia.

A £154m Mega Millions prize pool was shared by two winners from Georgia and New Jersey in January 2011.

Nine countries – the UK, Ireland, 
Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Austria – 
participate in EuroMillions, with sales from all of them going into the 
jackpot fund.

Twenty eight per cent of all 
EuroMillions ticket revenue goes towards good causes, which helps fund 
sports, community and social events around Britain and Europe.

Earlier this year National Lottery 
operator Camelot took out out a survey which shows that lottery winners 
have a surprising number of purchases in common.

had a walk-in wardrobe.

Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) had 
electric gates at their new home, one in five (22 per cent) set up a 
games room and 17 per cent bought a snooker table.

A fifth (22 per cent) bought a dog while one in 25 (4 per cent) got a cat.

Some 16 per cent adopted a healthy 
lifestyle with a gym in their home and one in 10 (12 per cent) installed
a bar to have drinks to celebrate their good fortune.
