Team news

Stoke

Stoke boss Mark Hughes is optimistic Glenn Whelan, Erik Pieters and Phil Bardsley will all be fit for selection for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Burnley at the Britannia Stadium.

Hughes says Whelan, who has been out since last month due to a broken leg, 'should be an option' and certainly expects Pieters and Bardsley to be available, despite the pair picking up knocks in the 2-1 win at Tottenham on November 9.

Glenn Whelan suffered a broken leg while playing for Republic of Ireland against Germany last month

However, it is anticipated that Marc Wilson will not feature because of the hamstring problem he sustained against Spurs, while Dionatan Teixeira (broken foot), Robert Huth (calf) and Peter Odemwingie (knee) definitely remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Shawcross, Pieters, Cameron, Muniesa, Bardsley, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Ireland, Whelan, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Moses, Diouf, Crouch.

Burnley

Burnley are hopeful Nathaniel Chalobah and Scott Arfield will be fit to face Stoke on Saturday.

Chelsea loanee Chalobah was injured playing for England Under 21s during the international break, while Arfield picked up a knock in training, but both have recovered well.

Long-term absentees Sam Vokes (knee) and Matt Taylor (achilles) remain out, but Steven Reid is now fully fit after a groin complaint.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Reid, Wallace, Kightly, Cisak, Sordell, Marney, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield, Ings, Chalobah, Jones.
