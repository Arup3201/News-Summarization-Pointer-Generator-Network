Manager Roy Hodgson was given a bottle of whisky by opposite number Gordon Strachan prior to kick-off ahead of England's match against Scotland.

Scotland boss Strachan presented Hodgson with the Famous Grouse Scotch whisky in the tunnel at Celtic Park before the international friendly on Tuesday night.

But the Scottish FA hardly pushed the boat out for the England boss as a 70cl bottle of that particular brand can be picked up for as little as £11 from supermarket chain Asda.

A 70cl bottle of Famous Grouse Scotch whisky will set you back £13 in Tesco.

A bottle the same size from Sainsbury's will cost you £18.

While Morrisons currently have an offer and you could pick up a bottle for £13.

But the best priced of the major supermarkets is Asda, where you can buy a bottle for just £11.

The two managers were seen exchanging pleasantries in the tunnel before Strachan handed over the bottle of tipple, that Hodgson seemed pleased to receive.

As the Scotland boss headed towards the changing rooms Hodgson emerged from the tunnel with his alcoholic gift and even posed for selfies with supporters.

After watching his side take a first-half lead thanks to Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chaberlain's glancing header, Hodgson's thoughts might have turned toward a celebratory glass after the match.
