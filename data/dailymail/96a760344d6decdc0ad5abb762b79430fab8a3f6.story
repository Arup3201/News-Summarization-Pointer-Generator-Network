The mother of a child beauty queen has been banned from entering her daughter into pageants in a fierce court battle for custody of the child, according to a new report.

Lindsay Jackson, 30, from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, sparked controversy after she dressed Maddy, five, as Dolly Parton, complete with fake breasts and butt, for a pageant that aired on TLC reality series Toddlers & Tiaras last year.

Her actions were severely criticised by her estranged partner, Bill Verst, who accused his ex  of sexually exploiting their child and has since applied for custody.

Now, RadarOnline reveals, Ms Jackson has been issued with a gag order and ordered not to enter her daughter into any more pageants until the next hearing on August 31.

A source close to Ms Jackson told the site: 'What kind of
 judge tells a parent what kind of extracurricular activity they can put
 their child in? Pageants arenâ€™t illegal and theyâ€™re not harming Maddy.

'This is no different from soccer or 
swimming or gymnastics and it is taking away Lisa's right to parent. The
 government should not be involved in this at all!'

Ms Jackson, who has been entering Maddy into beauty contests since she was 13 months old, insists that her daughter loves pageants and begs to go to
 them every weekend.

She told RadarOnline before the gag order last week: 'Maddy has been doing pageants since she was a baby and this is the first time Bill has ever said I'm a bad mother.

'He
 never made an argument about it until the show aired and now he's 
trying to say that she's sexualized and that I'm trying to exploit her 
and I'm not!'

Mr Verst has never had custody of Maddy. He is on 
probation for a DUI and is a convicted felon.

Ms Jackson has also accused him of failing to pay child support.

She also alleges that Maddy's father 
puts her in 'dangerous situations', and that she is facing a losing battle thanks
 to his well-connected family, who she says is influencing the decision.

'I feel like I'm fighting a battle without bullets,' she said.

'It is my right to put my child in 
pageants, it is just like any other extracurricular activity like soccer
 or gymnastics or football,' she argued.

'It is not illegal to do pageants, it
 is a hobby that we participate in and the government cannot tell me 
that I can't put my daughter in pageants.'
