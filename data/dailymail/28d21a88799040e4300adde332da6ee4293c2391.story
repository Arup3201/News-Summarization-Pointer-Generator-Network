A New York comedian has taken it upon himself to get the city's homeless in shape - by teaching Soul Cycle using stationary CitiBikes.

The ingenious idea was captured in a hilarious video by funnyman Fabrizio Goldstein aka 'The Fat Jew' in which he cites wanting the homeless people of New York to have the opportunity to have 'gorgeous bodies' as the reason for the venture.

The bike share scheme kicked off in the Big Apple recently but, at nearly $10 a day, the cost of biking around Manhattan is almost as punitive as the $32 price of a sought-after Soul Cycle class.

However, the fact the pedals still spin when the bikes are in the dock means CitiBike has 'opened up a whole new world' to the New York's poor, he says.

Feel the burn: Fabrizio Goldstein aka 'The Fat Jew' is taking Soul Cycle classes for the homeless in New York

Displaying his ample stomach, Goldstein is seen in the tape, posted on The Crosby Press on Wednesday, instructing a group of about six homeless people each sitting on a bike.

He says he rounded up the participants in Tompkins Square park in the East Village and they all jumped on a bike at a nearby docking station.

'There were five or six people who were like, "Let's party,"' he told the New York Daily News. 'I think they recognized a good time.'

In the class, which was Goldstein's third, he yells out common spin phrases like 'this is a cardio party' and 'you guys feelin' the burn?'

'The Fat Jew' said he regularly makes silly videos and the Soul Cycle spin off similarly started out as a joke.

But he told the Daily News that it has 'kind of turned into a real thing' and he wants to keep it going as long as the demand is there.

Joke: He said it started off as a joke but due to high demand, he's taking the classes for real now

'This is an unintended consequence,' he said. 'I got dozens of emails today from people saying, "If you put up a schedule, I will come."'

On Thursday he tweeted: 'I'm teaching SoulCycle classes to homeless people in New York City using parked CitiBikes. I'M BEING SERIOUS.'

He says the class isn't just for the homeless - anyone who balks at the idea of paying the exorbitant cost of the real thing can join in.

'Indoor cycling is too expensive it's not available to everybody,' he says in the video.

Adding to the Daily News, Golstein says: 'It's for whoever wants to show up. Everyone can kind of get into shape â€” me, first and foremost.'

But his main mission is to help those living on the streets attain 'beautiful definition.'

'I want the homeless people of New York to have the opportunity to have sick bodies. They could have really gorgeous bodies they just need the right work out regimen and CitiBike has really opened up a whole new world to them. I'm just a New Yorker helping other New Yorkers get beautiful definition.'

And, at least one participant is on his way there. 'My legs feel better,' an unnamed Citispin student says on the video.
