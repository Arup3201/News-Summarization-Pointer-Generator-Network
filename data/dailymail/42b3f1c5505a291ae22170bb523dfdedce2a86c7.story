Trader Luis Nobre is accused of a 100million euro fraud against an off-shore oil firm

A bank trader has appeared in court accused of a 100million euro fraud against an off-shore oil firm.

Luis Nobre, 48, is alleged to have duped major pipe lay company Allseas Group Ltd into handing him the vast sum of money in November 2011. 

He is accused of conning the firm using bogus bank guarantees worth more than $5billion and laundering some of the proceeds through a bank account in Singapore. 

Nobre, the sole director of Larn Ltd, registered to exclusive addresses in Harley Street and Marylebone, central London, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court this morning.

Wearing a blue pinstriped suit and a dark fedora hat, he pleaded not guilty to nine money laundering and fraud charges.

He was joined in the dock by Nadeem Khan, 54, and Buddika Kadurugamuwa, 45, who are both accused of helping Nobre launder money made from the alleged scam.

Nobre is said to have fraudulently got 100million euros transferred to Larn Ltd on November 1, 2011, from Allseas Group.

It is then claimed that he made a series of transactions totalling 16million euros during the rest of the month. 

Nobre is accused of laundering 269,141 Swiss Francs on January 4, 2012, and transferring another 651,691 Swiss Francs to an HSBC account in Singapore belonging to Kadurugamuwa in January and February the same year.

Nobre is also said to have obtained bank cards preloaded with funds from the Allseas Group between December 2011 and November 2012, and used a bank card belonging to the Federal Bank of the Middle East.

He is accused of having bogus papers showing he had a one billion euro guarantee and two further guarantees worth $2.37billion and $2.03billion.

Prosecutor Dominic Lewis said: 'There is potential evidence from Malta where the fraud was allegedly committed.' 

Judge Martin Beddoe freed all three defendants on bail until their trial, which is due to begin on September 7. They will all return to court for a pre-trial hearing on July 24.

Nobre, from Wembley, denies two counts of acquiring criminal property, four counts of transferring criminal property, and three counts of possessing an article for use in fraud.

Khan, whose address was listed as Harley Street, and Kadurugamuwa, of  Shepherds Bush, west London, denies one count of entering into a money laundering agreement.
