Google seems to be forever tweaking its Gmail design, but the latest images reveal a much larger revamp is heading for our inboxes.

The firm invited a select group of users to test its new layout, and according to screenshots released by Geek.com, the whole site has been made to look more like its Android app equivalent.

The sidebar has been replaced with a simplified panel, the 'Compose' button has been moved to the bottom right-hand corner and users can 'snooze' emails so they appear at the top of the inbox at a later date.

The sidebar has been replaced with a simplified panel.

The 'Compose' button has been moved to the bottom right-hand corner.

Users can 'snooze' emails so they appear at the top of the inbox at a later date. 

The new Reminders tool alerts users about dates in the future.

Elsewhere, Stars, which are used to keep emails at the top of the inbox, have been replaced with Pins.

The current Gmail tabs include Social, Promotions and Updates, in addition to the Primary inbox.

The
 images of the new design show these tabs have been moved to the left of
 the inbox, and this panel now include tabs for Travel, Purchases, and Finance.

It’s a significant step away from the current inbox, which many users have dubbed confusing and cluttered.

Another feature that aligns it with the Android app is the new Reminders tool that alerts users about dates in the future, or to respond to specific emails.

As the layout resembles the Android app, it’s unclear whether the new design will be used for mobile or desktop versions.

It is also unknown when - or if - the changes, will be rolled out other for other uses.

During a recent update to the service, Google added tabs along the top of the inbox to make it easier for users to manage their messages.

Google, like Twitter and Facebook, often experiment with new designs but not all are rolled out to users.

However, given the significant changes it’s likely that some – if not all – of the new features will eventually make their way to Gmail users as a whole.

The new design has made the desktop and mobile version of Gmail look more like its Android app equivalent, pictured. The redesign is also similar to a mobile test layout Geek.com leaked earlier this year

The redesign is also similar to a mobile test layout Geek.com leaked earlier this year, which adds weight to claims of a wider roll-out. 

Russell Holly from Geek.com said: ‘The wave of features we’ve been invited to take a look at shows an entirely different user interface, one that is clearly designed to function across a variety of screen sizes without losing functionality.

‘With any luck most of these features will make the cut and we’ll see an all new Gmail any day now.’
