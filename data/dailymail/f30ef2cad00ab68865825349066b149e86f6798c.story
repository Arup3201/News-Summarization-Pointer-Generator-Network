Toronado has joined the growing list of absentees from Qipco Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday.

The prospect of testing going has prompted trainer Richard Hannon and owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani to switch the colt's target from the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes to the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita in California on November 1.

Hannon is still expected to be doubly represented in the race with favourite Night of Thunder, this season's 2,000 Guineas winner, ridden by Richard Hughes and Toormore, the likely mount of Ryan Moore.

Toronado had been a leading contender for the QEII Stakes over a mile after winning the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot and claiming second in both the Sussex Stakes and Prix du Moulin.

But Harry Herbert, racing manager for owner Sheik Joaan's Al Shaqab Racing, confirmed the Breeders' Cup was now the intended target.

He said: 'The decision has been taken today that, due to the ground, we will bypass Ascot a head for the Breeders' Cup Mile instead.

'He loves fast ground and conditions at Ascot don't look like they will suit. It's disappointing for us, and Champions Day, that he won't be running but we have to do what's best for the horse.

'The Breeders' Cup race looks spot on for him, even more so now as the favourite (Wise Dan) won't be running, so we will go there instead.'

Champions Day is struggling to live up to the name with the much of the cream of British and European racing absent.

Among the missing are dual Derby winner Australia, Oaks and King George heroine Taghrooda, St Leger winner Kingston Hill, top sprinters Sole Power and Slade Power, French Derby winner The Grey Gatsby, Prix de la Foret scorer Olympic Glory and Coronation Stakes winner Rizeena.

A rare positive note has been struck for organisers with Sir Michael Stoute confirming the Queen's 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate will start in the Long Distance Cup.

It had been feared soft ground might prevent her running but Stoute said: 'We'll give it a shot.'

Encke, the Godolphin-trained 2012 St Leger winner who became embroiled in the Anabolic Steroid scandal involving trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, sustained a fatal hind limb injury while working on Tuesday.
