On June 6, 1944, HMS Belfast fired the shots that launched the D-Day landings - heralding the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany.

Aboard the flagship was Hollywood director George Stevens, who captured the historic event on one of the earliest 16mm color cameras for his own personal records.

He continued to film the war in kodachrome through the beaches of Normandy, onwards to the liberation of Paris, confronting the horrors of German concentration camps and finally, entering a war-ravaged Berlin.

Ok, let's go: HMS Belfast fired the opening shots of D-Day in June 6, 1944, signifying the largest amphibious invasion in history

Armada: One of 'Steven's irregulars' films the combined American, British and Canadian invasion force that landed on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944

Might: British warships escort their landing craft to the three beaches they and the Canadians were earmarked to invade - Sword, Juno and Gold

Hollywood: Director George Stevens at his camera aboard HMS Belfast - he would later go on to win two Oscar's in the 1950s

Bearing witness: Writers, directors and cameramen from the special coverage unit of the Allied expeditionary force fanned out among the Allied armies on D-Day to cover the 'greatest seaborne invasion in history'

His extremely rare film went unseen for decades until his son discovered the developed film after his father's death - providing color images of pivotal moments hitherto recorded in black-and-white.

Stevens, who made his name in the 1930s, directing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in 'Swing Time' in 1936, was dispatched to Europe by General Dwight Eisenhower to head up what he called 'combat motion-picture coverage.'

Clearing mines: Each town in Northern France that the Allies fought the Germans over came at a great cost - as street-to-street fighting, snipers and land mines took their toll on the liberating forces

Decimated: Entire swathes of northern France were destroyed during the fighting that expelled the German forces

Chaos: Rustic French towns lay in ruins after the fierce fighting between Allied and Nazi forces

Total ruins: An army jeep drives through what is left of a French town filmed by the color camera of George Stevens

The Supreme Allied Commander was concerned by the success of Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda movies and wanted to produce his own 35mm monochrome film for newsreels back home.

While those were a success, it was the personal footage that Stevens shot with his own 16mm camera that fascinates today, released for the first time this month on Blu-Ray.

The unseen film discovered by George Stevens Jr. was turned into 1994's documentary , D-Day to Berlin - giving an incredible glimpse into the bittersweet final days of the greatest conflict known to man.

In the documentary, Stevens recalls the first time he watched the films, astonished to see his father on board the HMS Belfast, preparing to land on French soil.

Son: George Stevens Jr. discovered his father's developed but unedited color film footage of the Second World War and converted it into a documentary called 'D-Day to Berlin'

Liberators: American soldier are greeted like heroes as they enter Paris in late August, 1944, after months of heavy fighting

Heroes: America soldier are greeted by Parisian women as they roll their forces into Paris - which spent almost four years under Nazi control

Release: Four years after Nazi forces goose-stepped down the Champs Elysees, American soldiers ride down the Parisian boulevard to a rapturous response from the city folk

Return: General Charles de Gaulle is welcomed to the victory parade in Paris on August 29, 1944

'This film came on and it was sort of grey-blue skies and barrage balloons, those big things that hung in the sky, and it was on a ship.

'It turned out to be the HMS Belfast, and it was suddenly I realized the morning of the 6th of June, the beginning of the greatest seaborne invasion in history,' he said in a recent interview according to The Daily Telegraph.

'I had this feeling that my eyes were the first eyes that hadn't been there who were seeing this day in color, and I watched this film unfold and on this ship - and all of these men with their flak jackets and anticipation of this day - and around a corner on the ship comes this man - helmet and jacket - and walks into a close-up, and it's my 37-year-old father. It was so moving.'

The filmmaker, who later would win Oscar's for directing 1951's 'A Place in the Sun' and 1956's 'Giant' begins his color film footage of the war on that fateful day, almost 70 years ago.

Next stop Berlin: George Stevens then traveled with American troops as they made their way across the heartland of Germany

Allies: As they drove further and further into Germany - they were greeted by the flags of the Big Three - Great Britain, The Soviet Union and The United States

His remarkable historical account takes his filming unit across decimated French towns, were street-to-street fighting proved an attritional slog.

Onwards from there, Stevens witnessed first hand the liberation of Paris, where Generals Charles De Gaulle, Patton and Montgomery all vied behind the scenes for battlefield glory.

Stevens films the launch of the failed Operation Market Garden, popularly known as 'A Bridge too Far', in which British and American paratroopers failed to take Arnhem - to arguably shorten the war.

At Dachau concentration camp, Stevens saw the sheer horror of humanity - his color images of dead bodies providing a glimpse of the evil of the Nazi final solution.

Horrors: But at Dachau, Stevens was confronted with the full evil capabilities of man at the concentration camp

Disgust: He saw first-hand and filmed in color what the Nazi's had committed as they sought their final solution

Heartbreaking: Many of the Dachau concentration camp 'inmates' were quarantined and sprayed with DDT following a typhus outbreak to prevent further deaths

Cowardly: Following liberation, some of the German troops in Dachau pretended to be Jewish prisoners to avoid arrest and punishment, according to George Stevens' reports

Grainy: At the Elbe, Soviet troops crossed the river to meet American soldiers for their historic first meeting

'It was extraordinary to see them all together': A week after leaving Nordhausen, German Army Group B had been encircled. This was the largest surrender of WWII that had been photographed

In color: This grainy grab of George Stevens footage shows the moment that Soviet and American forces exchanged flags as they met on the banks of the Elbe

Final destination: Once victory was secured after VE-Day, George Stevens filmed the aftermath at the Brandenburg gate in a decimated Berlin

The Allies drove eastward: General Bradley's 12th Army Group made contact with Ukrainian personnel near the German town of Torgau on the banks of the Elbe, linking the Americans and Russian army

Stevens then carried on into Germany and captured the momentous meeting of the forces of the United States and the Soviet Union on the banks of the Elbe.

D-Day to Berlin is narrated by Stevens Jr. and contains interviews with his father's film crew, known as the 'Stevens irregulars'.

'We thought at the time that this was the only color film of the war in Europe. As it turned out, there was some German film that had not yet been discovered,' he said.

'But it is the greatest body of color film, and World War II was a black-and-white war. That's how we see it. That's how we saw it. And suddenly to see it in color, it just took on a whole other dimension.'
