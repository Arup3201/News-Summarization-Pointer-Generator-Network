Arsenal have another speed merchant in their ranks after Theo Walcott revealed that his club sprint record has been broken.

Walcott confirmed to arseblog that Hector Bellerin is now crowned as Arsenal's new speed king, after he beat the England flyer's personal best time over 40 metres.

Dethroned: Walcott was the club's previous holder over 40m of 4.42 seconds which he set in 2009

Asked who’d win a sprint between him and club legend Thierry Henry, Walcott joked: 'Me! Thierry is in his 30s now so I would be very disappointed if I didn’t beat him. I beat his sprint record which Hector [Bellerin] has now broken.'

In 2009 Walcott broke Henry's record of 4.82 seconds, with his own effort of 4.42 seconds, but has now been usurped by 19-year-old Bellerin.

The young Spainard moved to North London from Barcelona in 2011 but has failed to make his debut for the club as of yet.

Bellerin, who plays right-back, is included in Arsenal's first-team squad this season after featuring eight times on loan to Championship side Watford last term.
