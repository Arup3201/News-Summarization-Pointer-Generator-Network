The formulas for the ideal profile pictures to attract the opposite sex have been revealed. And, with a heady blend of the world's most attractive people in the mix, there aren't many real people out there who will make the grade.

The perfect social networking profile picture for women to attract men must have a blend of the features of Kelly Brook, Mila Kunis and Scarlett Johansson, researchers say.

Men, meanwhile, are most likely to tempt
women with a photo that is a composite of David Beckham, Jonny Depp and
Ryan Gosling.

Is this the perfect social networking profile picture for women to attract men: a mix of celebrity beauties Kelly Brook, Mila Kunis and Scarlett Johansson

Brunette beauties Kelly Brook and Mila Kunis have the body and facial features, respectively, to make up the perfect profile picture

It is hardly surprising that Scarlett Johansson's eyes were deemed the most likely to attract a man

The news comes as over half of British social network users admit enhancing their online identity to appeal to potential partners - and one in five confesses they have created an entirely fake profile.

Women want their ideal partner to be dark, handsome, romantic, humorous, sporty and well-travelled, researchers from entertainment channel MTV found.

Their perfect profile photofit has Jonny Depp's hair; Ryan Gosling's eyes and David Beckham's jawline.

Men are after a busty, curvy woman who is also clever and into keeping fit, movies and eating out.

Their dream profile picture has Kelly Brook's body; Scarlett Johansson's eyes and the facial features of Mila Kunis.

We are a nation of digital daredevils with 90 per cent of social media users having accepted an invitation to connect online with a complete stranger.

If you are looking for love online, you should show a little cleavage in your profile picture as well as listing your favorite food and films

Nearly half have gone on to meet in person someone they first encountered online - and one in eight has started a sexual relationship with them.

Attractiveness emerged as the number one reason for accepting a stranger as a 'friend' via social media.

We apparently notice eyes, smiles and hair first when looking at a profile picture.

But over a quarter of men are most attracted to female profiles where breasts or bottoms feature prominently.

The most attractive personality traits are intelligence, confidence and sense of humour and most enticing interests are travel, cooking and dining, music and sport.

In a bid to impress the opposite sex, over half of Brits have photoshopped pictures of themselves or lied about their age, height, weight, job, achievements or reason for their last break-up.

And a quarter have pretended to be someone else on a social networking site.

The perfect attractive profile picture: A mix of celebrity hunks David Beckham, Jonny Depp and Ryan Gosling has been created by top artists after a survey of 2,400 people

Based on the findings, men hoping to meet a partner would do well to pepper their profile pages with shots of them playing rugby, travelling to romantic locations like Paris as well as sharing witty jokes and quotations.

Women wanting to find love online should share sexy shots of themselves sunbathing or working out as well as listing their favourite food and films.

The survey of 2,400 people, who were shown images of celebrities, was carried out to mark the start of the second series of MTV show Catfish.

A 'catfish' is a person who pretends to be someone they are not, particularly to pursue deceitful online romances.

Men in the market for love should include shots of themselves playing rugby nad travelling to romantic locations like Paris in their profile, as well as sharing witty jokes and quotations

David Beckham's jaw line and Ryan Gosling's eyes help to make up the perfect profile picture for a man looking to attract the opposite sex

The show sees the real people behind fake social media profiles unmasked.

MTV spokeswoman Jo Bacon commented: 'Most of us dream about being added by a Mila Kunis or David Beckham lookalike online whilst dreamy eyes, a killer smile and a decent bum all get our pulses racing when we look at a social media profile we don't know.

'But do we really know who is on the other side of the profile?

'These amazing figures show social media users up and down the country would be more than happy to connect, form a relationship and even consider sex with someone they don't know, especially if they find their profile attractive.

'However, what we want to highlight is that the person you are conversing with might not be quite what you expect with as many as one in five of us actively using and creating false profiles.'
