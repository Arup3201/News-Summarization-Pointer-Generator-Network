Liverpool may be forced to play on their deteriorating pitch for another season because of Anfield's redevelopment.

Manager Brendan Rodgers has frequently bemoaned the state of the iconic playing surface which is struggling to withstand the wear and tear of the season. Opposition players have also complained.

Rodgers has called the surface 'awful' and this week said: 'We need to do something about the pitch because we need a better pitch if we are going to play the game we are playing.'

The Anfield playing surface was given a ten-year lifespan but is now 14 years old

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes a new playing surface would hugely help his side out

There is no sprinkler system with a hose to water the pitch before matches at Anfield

Liverpool's owners acknowledge the problem but cranes are scheduled to be on the pitch during June as contractors step up work on the new £100million main stand to add 8,500 extra seats to Anfield’s capacity.

The current pitch is a Desso GrassMaster but it was given a ten-year lifespan and is now 14 years old.

Groundstaff have been forced to to patch it up each season.

The drainage and irrigation system dates back even further to 1998. There is no sprinkler system with a hose used to water the pitch before matches.

Anfield's redevelopment work could mean that the pitch cannot be replaced anytime soon

Even if Liverpool were able to put in new drainage prior to the cranes moving in there are fears the weight of the machinery could potentially burst the piping. 

Consequently, Liverpool may have to continue playing on the same surface in 2015/16 before it can be ripped up and replaced when the stand is completed in the summer of 2016.
