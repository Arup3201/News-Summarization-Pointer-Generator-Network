Despite years of coaching youth football in Indianapolis, John Padgett had never walked away with the top prize: the coveted Washington Township Football League championship.

But just four days before he lost his lengthy battle with cancer, the 48-year-old coach watched with joy as his fifth and sixth grade team took the title - winning his version of the Super Bowl.

And just nine hours before he passed away, the 18 youngsters took their celebrations from a local elementary school to his bedside, knowing that it wouldn't be the same without him.

The coach, a married father, passed away on Sunday night at his home in Indianapolis just hours before the boys said their goodbyes, the Indy Star reported.

'I'm just so thankful to the boys,' his wife Debra said. 'Because I know – I really believe – I got some extra time with John because he wanted to see the season through, and he wanted to go to that Super Bowl party.'

Padgett was diagnosed with lymphoma in his lungs last year and had part of his left lung removed, but by April doctors saw it had spread to his lymph system and gave him just months to live.

He underwent repeated rounds of chemotherapy and always made it to the games, even though, by the end, he couldn't walk and struggled to breathe. 

By the time the boys took their pizza party to his hospital bed at his home last weekend, their coach could no longer speak or open his eyes.

But assistant coach Mark Zinn said he is sure Padgett knew they were there, because when he held his hand and told him he was an amazing man, Zinn felt Padgett's hand squeezing his.

'I about lost it,' Zinn told the Indy Star. 

Padgett, a graphics designer, leaves behind his wife Debbie, 52, and their son Darian.

The couple, who learned after their married that they couldn't have children, adopted Darian after Debbie met him at Ernie Pyle Elementary, where she taught the second grade.

She became aware of the little boy because he kept on stealing breakfast, and she soon learned that he was in the foster system.

She went home and told her husband that they needed to adopt the boy and - without even meeting him - Padgett agreed.

When Darian joined the family, he asked his dad to play football with him, and Padgett signed him up for the Washington Township Football League and joined as coach.

But even after his son grew out of the team, Padgett continued coaching the kids.

Still smiling: Padgett, pictured in hospital, even missed an Alice Cooper concert because he didn't have enough energy to go to both the show and his team's semifinal - so he chose his team

Friends paid tribute to the beloved coach, who always put the kids first. They remembered how he skipped an Alice Cooper concert - his favorite musician - to see his team's semi-final earlier this month.

The boys are now planning to be there for their coach, attending his funeral on Friday wearing their jerseys, each with the name 'Padgett' across the back. 

'He was dying, but he faced it,' Zinn said. 'John got right in cancer's face and said, "You're not going to beat me. You might win, but you're not going to beat me".'
