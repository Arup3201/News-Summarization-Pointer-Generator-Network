Between commuting time and work hours, New York City residents have the longest work weeks among the country's 30 biggest cities, city Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a report released Tuesday.

The report said a typical week for a full-time New York worker adds up to more than 49 hours, including an average of more than six hours of commuting time. That was more than four hours longer than in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the average work week was about 44 1/2 hours. Commuting time made up just under 3 1/2 hours of that.

The report was based on data from the U.S. Census from 1990 and 2000 and the 2013 American Community Survey. 

Busy schedules: The report said a typical week for a full-time New York worker adds up to more than 49 hours, including an average of more than six hours of commuting time. Commuters are seen in New York in 2014

Stringer said commuting times were longer for lower-wage workers, who were more likely than higher-wage workers to live in parts of the city that aren't as well-served by public transportation. 

Security guards, for example, on average spent more than eight hours a week commuting.

'Nursing and home health aides and maids and housekeepers also report long commutes, while chief executives, taxi drivers and physicians and surgeons report the shortest commutes,' the report said. 

In a statement, Stringer said 'New York is America’s hardest working city, but it’s a one-two punch for lower wage workers, who get paid less and travel longer to get to work. 

'This means employees in the Big Apple get paid less than it appears on an hourly basis, because their commutes are significantly greater than anyone else in the country.' 

The report found that 'In New York City, workers in the finance sector, on average, work the longest workweeks. With usual work schedules topping 47 hours, New York City financial workers spend, on average, almost four hours more per week working than do their counterparts in other large cities.'

It also said that workers in advertising, media, computer, legal services, arts and entertainment, food service, and retail trade have longer hours compared to people with jobs in those industries in other major US cities.

 'But longer workweeks are not characteristic of all New York City industries,' the report said. City workers in manufacturing, real estate, and health care, for example, work fewer hours in a typical week than do workers in those industries in other large cities.' 

Stringer said the report showed a need for the city to expand its transit networks, as well as promote flexible work arrangements along with predictable scheduling. 

'If New York City is going to symbolize the American Dream, we can’t be a nightmare when it comes to long work hours and commuting,' Stringer said in the statement. 'Our residents deserve better.'

Long day: Though New York workers have an average work week of 42.5 hours, in San Francisco workers work approximately 44 hours per week
