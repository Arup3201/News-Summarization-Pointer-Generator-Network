The parents at the head of Britain's biggest family admitted to being 'utterly devastated' today after losing their 17th baby.

Sue Radford went for her 12-week scan this morning only to find the child due in April had died.

It came a day after she and her baker husband Noel, from Morecambe, Lancashire, spoke of their excitement at expecting again just 11 months after giving birth to their youngest Casper.

'It's with such sadness that we have to say our beautiful baby's 
heartbeat stopped two days ago, we are utterly devastated beyond words,' 
they said in a statement today.

Yesterday, before their bad news, the Radfords said they were ‘absolutely thrilled’ to be having another baby, who will be a sibling for Chris, 24, Sophie, 19, Chloe, 18, Jack, 16, Daniel, 14, Luke, 12, Millie, 12, Katie, ten, James, nine, Ellie, eight, Aimee, seven, Josh, five, Max, four, Tilly, three, Oscar, two and Casper, 11 months.

Mrs Radford wrote on Facebook after her 12-week scan: ‘We are so excited to announce Radford baby 17 will be joining this family in April.

‘As you can imagine, the children are so excited. Little Tilly said to me: “Mummy you have a baby in your tummy”. It was so sweet.’ But she added: ‘I feel so sick. Whoever named it morning sickness was lying. Try morning, noon and night sickness.’

The hard-working couple, who own a bakery, live in a former children’s home and use a minibus to get around.

Mrs Radford, 38, first became pregnant with Chris when she was 14. She and husband Noel, now 41, were determined to keep the baby as they had both been given up for adoption. The couple married four years later and second child Sophie soon arrived.

Their youngest child, Casper, was born last October weighing 8lb 8oz and the labour lasted just 16 minutes.

Not long after his birth, Mrs Radford – who has on average had a baby every 17 months over the past 23 years – pledged to have even more. The couple also became grandparents last year when Sophie gave birth to daughter Daisy.

A family friend said: ‘They are a lovely family and the children are so well-behaved. They are obviously great parents.’

The family rose to fame in 2011 when they were featured on Channel 4’s 15 Kids and Counting.
