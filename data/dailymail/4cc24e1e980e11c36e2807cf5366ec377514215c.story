Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins is optimistic of success in the Road World Championships time-trial in Ponferrada on Wednesday.

Wiggins finished second to Germany's Tony Martin, the Olympic silver medallist, in Florence last year but is confident the 47.1-kilometre route favours his attributes this time around.

'I'm in better shape than last year,' the 34-year-old Wiggins told BBC Sport.

'It's quite mountainous and suits me more than Tony. Every year I think this might be the year but you never know. That's why I like it.'

Wiggins is joined in the race by Commonwealth Games champion Alex Dowsett.

The Londoner beat Dowsett to the British title in June and won a short Tour of Britain time-trial last weekend.

Wiggins was second in last year's Road World Championships time-trial but won it on the 2014 Tour of Britain

'This year's course is a lot different to last year's, which was long and flat,' added Wiggins, who did not ride the Glasgow 2014 time-trial.

'You have to think more on this course. There's no room for error.

'You need to have enough in the tank for the end. It's challenging, a true test of the time trial.' 

The former Olympic and Tour de France champion came third in the 2014 Tour of Britain
