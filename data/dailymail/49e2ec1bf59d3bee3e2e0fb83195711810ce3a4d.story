Unfair: Richard Chapman was dismissed by Malvern Town Council in April this year for giving colleagues tomato plants

A former council clerk has won a compensation payout after he was unfairly sacked from his job - for giving colleagues tomato plants.

Richard Chapman was dismissed by Malvern Town Council in April this year after it was claimed the fruity gifts showed favouritism towards some members of staff.

But on Thursday an employment tribunal heard that only one worker at the authority had not received a plant.

The female employee moaned to council chiefs that the town clerk was favouring other workers by dishing out the tomatoes to everyone but her.

She complained to bosses that the plants - brought from Mr Chapman's greenhouse - had been doled out to every other member of staff.

He was then accused of bullying, harassment and favouritism and was sacked following an internal investigation which found him guilty of gross misconduct.

Mr Chapman launched legal action against the Worcestershire authority - claiming unfair dismissal.

An employment tribunal has now ruled in his favour and agreed he was sacked after 12-years of 'unblemished service'.

Employment judge Mary Cocks branded the council's investigation 'flawed' following a four day hearing in Birmingham.

Mrs Cocks dismissed the authorities claims and revealed that even the town mayor had sabotaged his return to work.

She said Cllr Julian Roskams had deliberately put obstacles in the way of Mr Chapman returning to his job following the investigation.

She added: 'The council acted outside the bounds of reasonable responses in dismissing Mr Chapman.

'I have rarely heard a case where the unfairness of the dismissal was so apparent to me.

'The investigation by Angela Roberts mushroomed out of control, and the report was woefully inadequate.

'Councillor Roskams was patently dissatisfied with the findings of the disciplinary panel and put obstacles in the way of Mr Chapman returning to work.'

Giving evidence Mr Chapman said he made tomato plants from his garden available to all staff members.

His solicitor Richard Hignett slammed the case against him as a 'witch hunt' and labelled the appeal panel that rejected his pleas to return to work a 'kangaroo court'.

He said: 'This essentially turned into a witch hunt against my client, because the council failed to control the terms of the investigation.'

During the mayor's evidence Mr Hignett told Cllr Roskams: 'You wanted this investigation to be as wide as it needed to be in order to see just how much dirt the investigation could stick on Mr Chapman.'

The tribunal also heard the council investigated allegations Mr Chapman had shouted at two staff members.

He was also accused of 'bellowing' at another individual in a car park after allegedly falling foul of a car park attendant.

The council launched a full investigation into his conduct after a complaint from colleague Deborah Powell.

The local authority, which opposed his unfair dismissal claim, alleged he had 'breached the council's bullying and harassment policy..'

Mr Chapman was suspended, eventually allowed to return to work, but later dismissed in April.

Giving evidence, Mr Chapman said he'd apologised to the two staff members he shouted at in October last year while suffering from stress.

He said he was told an official warning would remain on his record for ever, which is in contravention of the ACAS code used by the council.

The tribunal decided that dismissal was unfair and ordered the council to pay him an unspecified amount.

Speaking after the hearing - which has cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds - Mr Chapman said he was 'relieved' by the ruling.

He added: 'It's been a very stressful 12 months and I'm totally drained.

'I shouted at two people when I was wrong and that's all I did.

'I worked with most of the people at the council for 10 years and was very supportive of my staff.'
