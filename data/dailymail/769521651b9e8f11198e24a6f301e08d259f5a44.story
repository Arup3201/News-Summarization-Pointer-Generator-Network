Troubled British rock star Pete Doherty has checked out of his rehab clinic in Thailand after apparently beating his heroin addiction - despite twisted 'fans' even sending him heroin by post.

The 35-year-old Libertines and Babyshambles frontman – who was consuming an astonishing 3.5 grams of heroin a day before seeking rehab in the Far East in October – is now  drug-free and recording with band mates in a studio at a secret beach location in Thailand.

Doherty suffered a relapse in early December after being off heroin for nearly two months, but has been 'clean' since and is now preparing to go back on stage and launching a fund to help other addicts get treatment at the innovative British-run Hope Rehab Centre in Si Racha. 

In a video shared exclusively with MailOnline, the musician gives a guided tour of the centre.

Pointing to a fighter plane parked in the grounds of Hope, he tells the camera: 'I had this specifically brought in, just in case I need to evacuate in an emergency. 

'But we couldn't move the chocks, so I got the bikes instead.'

Last month, he signed a deal with Virgin EMI along with former bandmate Carl Barat which will see them record the first new album by their band The Libertines for a decade.

Doherty, who went out with Kate Moss, checked out of the rehab centre run by recovered addict Simon Mott at Christmas after a  programme involving a combination of methadone, counselling, exercise and intense therapy.

At least one fan tried to send Doherty heroin in the post. 'Pete has a hard core of fans and followers and they are not all healthy minded,' said Mott, who runs Hope with his Thai wife Alon.

'He received a lot of fan mail which we searched before handing it over. Sadly, on two occasions, we intercepted drugs we had to destroy. It sickened me that there are such disgusting people out there who would go to such lengths to sabotage his treatment.'

Both packages were posted in France – one arriving two weeks into his stay at Hope and the second at Christmas just before Doherty left. It is not known if the same person sent both packages.

'When I threw the second package into the fire, I could smell the familiar stench of burning heroin, something I hadn't experience since I stopped using it myself 12 years ago,' said Mott. 'Whoever did this has a warped mind.'

On another occasion, Mott said, one male fan tried to climb over the wall of the rehab centre to visit Doherty but was chased away. One client, meanwhile, became so obsessed with Doherty he had to be forcibly discharged and was later arrested and deported.

In video interviews with counsellors shared exclusively with MailOnline by Hope, Doherty – whose career has been blighted by drug abuse and scandal – speaks frankly about his fight against addiction and his sense of pride at writing and performing songs while sober.

He wrote songs in a Vietnam War-era fighter plane parked in the grounds of Hope which overlooks a stretch of quiet coastline 90 minutes south of Bangkok, on a plot of land provided by the former head of Thailand's Ministry of Transport, Dr Sribhumi Sukhanetr. 

Mott said he was impressed by Doherty's determination to conquer his heroin habit and said he had never known a client check into rehab with such a heavy drug habit – 3.5 grams of heroin a day.

In video interviews with counsellors shortly before he checked out, Doherty - looking plump compared to his previous emaciated appearance – said he realised drugs had crippled his creativity and said he felt 'blessed' to have survived addiction.

'Long before drugs, it was music that would raise my spirits or just make me want to live or believe in something,' he said. 'It's a great new drug, being clean. It's not really a drug at all – it's finding myself.

'Drugs don't make you more creative and one of the great things about being clean is that I'll be able to fulfill that side of things (my creativity) … I feel as if something inside me is shifting.

'It is almost against my better judgment. But my better judgment has got me in (trouble) more often than not. When I follow what I know is true in my heart, that's when things turn out right.' 

The wayward singer has struggled with his addictions for the past decade and has been in and out of rehab as far back as 2004.

He was first arrested for possessing Class A substances in October 2005 and was eventually jailed in 2008 after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offences. 

Doherty was plunged into further controversy after a picture of him allegedly forcing his pet cat to inhale from a crack pipe appeared on the front page of The Sun in 2007. 

His first stint in rehab came after he was released from prison for burgling the home of former Libertines bandmate Carl Barat in 2003.

He was sentenced to six months in prison which was later cut to two on appeal and the singer lasted just three days at a treatment centre.

During his second rehab attempt in 2012, Doherty was thrown out after less than three weeks because staff at The Cabin, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, deemed him a 'disruptive influence'.

Although he is now out of rehab, Doherty continues to travel to Hope to attend drug counselling meetings and has made arrangements to be accompanied by a Hope counsellor when he goes back on tour with The Libertines.

He has also launched a Pete Doherty Hope Initiative to fund treatment for addicts unable to afford treatment which will be supported in part by proceeds from gigs and record sales and by public donations.

Dylan Kerr, head counsellor at Hope, said Doherty had achieved his longest drug-free period since his teens while at the rehab centre in Sriracha – but warned that the months ahead will be challenging as he returns to the limelight.

'We saw Pete grow over the course of his treatment at Hope, which was reflected in his new found interest in nature, spirituality and positive creativity,' he said.

'Pete has a one off slip during the course of his treatment which served to help him understand how vulnerable he is in the outside world.

'After conquering a long and difficult detox it was wonderful to see the real Pete emerge with colour and a smile to his face, instead of a wasted, sweaty yellow jaundice pin cushion.'

Doherty's one relapse into heroin use came when he went to Bangkok in early December for a short break from Hope, which allows its clients to come and go freely. Kerr warned: 'We are painfully aware that of the pressures he will be going out into the world with.

'The expectations on him are massive, possibly even unreasonable and unrealistic. I really wonder how he is going to maintain his recovery with so many people pulling at him from every direction.'
