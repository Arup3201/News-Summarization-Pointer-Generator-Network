An award-winning food blogger has hit out at bakery chain Lola's Cupcakes, accusing it of 'stealing' her recipe for Marmite and chocolate cakes and passing it off as their own.

Kerstin Rodgers used her blog, Ms Marmite Lover, to attack the London bakers for saying they made the first official sweet and savory treat last week when she posted a recipe online in 2010.

She claims their guide to baking the cakes 'makes no sense' and contains identical passages to her own recipe, which was also published in her book in 2011.

Kerstin Rodgers, who goes by the name Ms Marmite Lover online, claims bakery chain Lola's Cupcakes stole her recipe for Marmite and chocolate cupcakes

Proof?: Kerstin posted this image online from the pages of her book showing the recipe for the cupcakes

Speaking to Mail Online, she said: 'I was a bit shocked when I saw the recipe, I thought "how can they be saying this when they know perfectly well it's not true?"

Ms Rodgers' says that several identical passages from her recipe book appeared in Lola's own guide

'I have contacted my lawyers about this, but there isn't much case history in the UK because I think people are afraid of taking on big corporations.

'Lola's have sent me a message saying they are formulating a response, so we will see what the next step is after that.

'They should absolutely not be allowed to get away with this.

'If they wanted my recipe they could have just hired me, but instead they decided to run roughshod over my work for their own gain.'

On her blog, she added: 'Their recipe makes no sense. The ingredients and the method do not match. That's what tends to happen when you copy and paste from someone else's work, you slip up.

'The biggest "coincidence" is that the genius who runs Lola's Cupcakes came up with this quote: "The centre will either be a shock or a pleasure depending on where your Marmite sensibilities lie!"

'Lets compare and contrast with my blog post of 2010 which says: "This 'centre' would either be a shock, or a pleasure depending on where your Marmite sensibilities lie".'

Ms 
Rodgers said Lola's has no right to
 claim theirs as the first Marmite cupcakes, as the brand contacted her 
in 2010 to make a recipe.

She also accused Lola's of 'bungling' her recipe, with online users complaining that the instructions were impossible to follow.

In
 a joint statement, Lola's and Marmite denied that the recipe was 
stolen.

The companies said: 'Ms Marmite Lover’s cupcake has a vanilla sponge and cream cheese topping, while Lola’s is chocolate sponge with a buttercream chocolate ganache frosting. 

'The only similarity is the use of a liquid centre that is found in over a third of Lola’s range. This is a standard caramel recipe with some Marmite added.'

Last week Lola's released the 'first ever' Marmite cupcakes. Managing director Asher Budwig said he was 'always searching for ways to create innovative, exciting cupcakes with unusual ingredients'

Ms Rogers said Lola's recipe 'makes no sense' as parts from her guide were used out of context

Ms Rodgers began blogging about her recipes in 2008 under the name Ms Marmite Lover, then shot to fame by hosting an underground supper club at her north west London home.

Since then has won the Fortnum And Mason Online Food Writer Award 2014 and the Guild of Food Writers Food Blog of the Year Award 2013.

Many other supper clubs have now popped up in the capital and beyond, and Ms Rodgers' website plots them on a map, helping to spread the trend.

Kerstin Rodgers, aka Ms Marmite Lover for followers of her blog, began writing online about food and recipes in 2008.

However she wasn't truly well known until 2009, when she began hosting a supper club at her home in north west London, one of the capital's first underground restaurants.

Since the trend for supper clubs took off, she has become a household name, publishing a book of her recipes called Supper Club: Recipes And Notes From The Underground Restaurant.

She also won the Fortnum And Mason Online Food Writer Award 2014 and the Guild of Food Writers Food Blog of the Year Award 2013.

Her writing has appeared in several national newspapers, and she was named among the 1000 most influential Londoners in a poll.

She has nearly 14k followers on Twitter and 4,500 followers on her Facebook page.

She also trained as a photographer and has had a number of exhibitions in Paris, Chartres and London.

In another, rather more bizarre brush with stardom, the 80s hit ‘My girl’s mad at me’ by Madness was written about her.
