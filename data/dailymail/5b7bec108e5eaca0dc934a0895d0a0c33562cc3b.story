Four passengers were injured today after a plane was blown off the runway amid 80mph winds, as Britain braces itself for days of grey skies and heavy downpours.

The twin-propeller Saab 340 was attempting to take off from Stornoway Airport on the Isle of Lewis just before 8.30am when strong gusts caused it to veer off the tarmac and nose-dive into the grass, sparking a major investigation. 

It came as a deep Atlantic depression whipped Machrihanish, Argyll, with 77mph winds, while gales of 71mph were detected in Edinburgh.

Depsite a wind warning remaining in place for the Shetland Islands - where gales of around 75mph are expected until about 11pm tonight - forecasters say the wind will continue to ease this evening.

But it will still be a weekend of miserable weather for most people, as a band of low pressure  sweeps across the UK tomorrow, drenching the southern and central areas with up to 15mm rain.

 The twin-propeller Saab 340 was carrying 28 people and had been due to fly to Glasgow at 8.35am. Four people were injured 

The incident involving a Saab 340 aircraft operated by Loganair happened at 8.33am today, amid winds of up to 80mph in Scotland

Meanwhile, top temperatures will be above average for this time of year, with the mercury expected to reach a balmy 13C in the south west. London, which is around 10C today, will see highs of around 9C, while temperatures could reach 6C in Scotland and up to 7C in northern England.

Today's windy weather wreaked havoc across the country, with most areas experiencing gales of at least 40mph.

The Loganair flight, which was carrying 28 people, had been due to fly to Glasgow at 8.35am but remained grounded as two people were taken to Western Isles Hospital with minor injuries.

Police said two men were taken to hospital, while two women sustained minor injuries, but declined medical assistance. 

An investigation has now been launched into the incident and a spokesman said normal operations should resume once the plane has been removed from the runway. 

The Stornoway area had seen gales of around 40mph, while there were also winds of 69mph recorded in Yorkshire.  

Amid the strong winds, a passenger had a miracle escape when a car park barrier smashed through a vehicle’s windscreen  at a shopping centre in Ellesmere Port. 

Police said both the driver and passenger of the gold Renault Clio escaped unscathed after the incident at the Cheshire Oaks centre. 

This rare natural atmospheric phenomenon was captured on the North Yorkshire and County Durham border yesterday evening 

An almost-complete rainbow was spotted at night near Hutton Magna. It is known as a 'Moonbow' 

The phenomenon is caused by the moon's light being reflected and refracted off water droplets in the air 

A stunning rainbow shone onto a herd of cows in the Peak District, Derbyshire, as the grey sky loomed behind 

The car was being driven in to a car park at the time of the incident and the large barrier, which was open at the time, came crashing in to the vehicle and through a passenger window at the rear of the car. 

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said: 'At around 2:15pm on Thursday 1st January 2015 officers were called to an incident on Stanney Woods Avenue, Longlooms Road East in Ellesmere Port involving a car which had been hit by piece of the road barrier.

'The car, a gold Renault Clio was damaged when the barrier swung out into the middle of the road smashing through the passenger side of the windscreen. The driver of the vehicle and passenger were both uninjured in the incident.' 

Despite the strong gusts, yesterday was one of the warmest New Year's Days on record, with blue skies across most of the country leading to a clear evening. In County Durham, one walker spotted a 'moonbow', a rare natural atmospheric phenomenon in which a rainbow appears at night. 

The phenomenon, spotted at Hutton Magna, is caused by the moon's light being reflected and refracted off water droplets in the air.  

A couple made the most of the clear blue skies and sunshine in the market town of Helmsley, North Yorkshire this morning 

The pair walked their Labrador through Duncombe Park, amid balmy temperatures which are above average for this time of year 

There were clear skies and warm temperatures this morning at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, as many parts of the UK were whipped by high winds

Rutting deer were spotted at Chatsworth this morning. Despite cold night-time temperatures, there is no immediate sign of another cold snap 

This three-day forecast shows a clear day today, followed by heavy rain over many parts of central and southern England tomorrow 

But tonight will see the last of the clear skies, as a band of low-pressure sweeps across the UK tomorrow, bringing up to 15mm of rain across most of Wales and south and central England.

Those living in northern England will escape the worst of the wet weather and could see some sunshine. But forecasters say there could even be some snow on high grounds, including the Lake District, Snowdonia and the Pennines. 

Meanwhile, top temperatures will be above average for this time of year, with the mercury expected to reach a balmy 13C in the south west. London, which is around 10C today, will see highs of around 9C, while temperatures could reach 6C in Scotland and up to 7C in northern England.  

On Sunday, most parts of the country can expect to see some sunshine, particularly in the east of England. But there will be heavy rain in western areas, while the mercury will drop by around two degrees in most parts of the UK. 

Britons should also be braced for some cold nights, with an ice warning in place for most of Scotland tonight, where temperatures could plunge to -6C.

Dan Williams from the Met Office said there could also be patchy fog early tomorrow and Sunday morning, due to the cold temperatures. Night-time temperatures in North Wales could reach -5C, while the Midlands and the south will remain at just above zero.

However, there is no immediate sign of another significant cold snap, the Met Office said. Next week looks to be more unsettled, with high temperatures, followed by strong gales on Wednesday. 

Leon Brown, meteorologist at The Weather Channel UK, said a very deep Atlantic depression will pass just south of Iceland by the middle of next week bringing gales over the north on Wednesday and some heavy rain too.

That rain will move southwards late Wednesday to Thursday and will be heaviest over West Wales and western England, he added.
