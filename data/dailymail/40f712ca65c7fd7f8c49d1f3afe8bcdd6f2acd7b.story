A bored father waiting to collect his daughter from school filmed pupils repeatedly slipping on ice in a hilarious six minute video.

The amusing footage, seen by about 80,000 people on YouTube, shows pupils toppling over and skidding on the icy patch as they made their way home from lessons.

Alan Andersen was parked outside the school waiting to pick up his daughter when he started laughing at people slipping over.Â

Flat out: The amusing footage, seen by about 
80,000 people, shows pupils toppling over and skidding on the icy patch 
as they made their way home from lessons

Ouch: Alan Andersen was parked outside the school waiting to pick up his daughter when he started seeing people slip over and can be heard chuckling to himself

But instead of leaping from the car to help them, he whipped out his phone and filmed them instead.

The shameless father can be heard chuckling to himself as he watches the pupils slide around saying: 'Oh, it's funny' and 'Ouch'.

It's unclear from the footage where in U.S, which is in the grip of one of the most brutal winters on record, is filmed.

Mr Anderson said in the clip: 'They're gonna fall, they're gonna fall, they're gonna fall' before one group of girls slips over.

He adds, laughing hysterically, 'Okay
 we've got another kid coming, he's coming a little fast, if he turns 
here he's going to drill it right about... now'.

Mr Anderson, who watches about 10 people fall over, said: 'At least they're laughing about it, oh my gosh. Guaranteed slippage.'

No laughing matter: Mr Anderson can be heard in the clip: 'They're gonna fall, they're gonna fall, they're gonna fall' before one group of girls slips over

Fun: When his daughter arrives and gets in the car she joins in the fun and the pair confess 'we're bad people'

Skidding: Mr Anderson, who watches about 10 people fall over, said: 'At least they're laughing about it, oh my gosh. Guaranteed slippage'

When his daughter finally arrives the pair spend another couple of minutes watching the fun unfold, and seem impressed when a girl on her phone manages to run through the ice patch without falling over.

However, they break into hysterics when three more students walk by spending several minutes trying to push each other over.

The father and daughter then finally confess: 'We're kind of bad people'.
