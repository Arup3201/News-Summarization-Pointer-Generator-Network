A former Picture Page cast member has become the latest women to make sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby, claiming he drugged her and sexually assaulted her when she was a 15-year-old aspiring actress.

Mother-of-three Renita Chaney Hill, who appeared alongside the comedian in the educational program, said the pair had relationship for four years during the 1980s while he paid her college tuition.

The 47-year-old from Pittsburgh said she would be flown to different cities around the country and when they stayed in hotels, he would insist she had a drink, even though she was still in high school. 

She told KDKA she believed that is when he drugged her as she did not remember anything until she woke up the next morning.

Allegations: Mother-of-three Renita Chaney Hill, 47, claims that Cosby would fly her to stay in different hotels around the country where he would drug her

Encounter: She first met the comedian when she was a 15-year-old aspiring actress and was chosen to appear on Picture Pages (right) in the 1980s 

Educational: Cosby presented the short programs aimed at preschool children from 1974 until the early 1980s which involved him playing games and painting pictures 

The pair first met when Cosby was in Pittsburgh filming for his children's educational show Picture Pages. 

He fronted the educational program aimed at pre-school children from 1974 until the early 1980s  

He was looking for cast members so Hill's modelling agency put her forward and she got the job. 

'Promises of bright lights and fame. That’s where I thought I was headed, that’s what everyone who knew me thought I was headed,' she told KDKA.

'He would fly me to a number of cities. He would be busy during the day, then I’d come to his hotel room at night,' she added.

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.

Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee.

Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992.

Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship.

'One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn’t like it. I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that.'

When she turned 19, she cut off all ties with Cosby, even though he was paying her way through school.

Her parents seemed happy with her continuing what seemed like a mentoring relationship, but Hill had enough, and even gave up her dream of becoming an actress. 

Hill claims her husband and three daughters are aware of what happened.

She told the station she has no apologies for waiting 30 years to tell the story and said she decided to come forward when Cosby's lawyers criticized other alleged victims. 

Hill added: 'No one wants to be associated with something like this. But the bottom line for me is that no one has the right to violate someone else, no matter who they are. I don’t care how big they are or how the community sees them, it’s not right.'

Earlier on Friday, Angela Leslie, a former model and actress, accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her in a luxury Las Vegas hotel suite after trying to ply her with alcohol.

She claimed that the TV star forced her to masturbate him after pouring her a strong drink. 

Leslie, now 52, was reportedly invited to meet Cosby at his hotel in 1992 after sending him a letter and photograph. She was hoping to get career advice from the star after initially meeting the comedian two years previously on the set of The Cosby Show.

Actress Louisa Moritz came forward on Thursday and accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Moritz, 68, said that she was backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971 when Cosby stuck his penis in her mouth.

The One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest actress told TMZ: 'He took his hands and put them on the back of my head and forced his penis in my mouth, saying, "have a taste of this. It will do you good in so many ways."' 

As the allegations continued to come out, Cosby was in the Bahamas performing. 

During the appearance, the 77-year-old put his head in his hands and pretended to sob, new video obtained by MailOnline has revealed today.

He joked that parents would not let their children near him, as fans in the audience laughed and applauded the skit.

'Parents are coming and taking their children home, saying to me ''Bill Cosby you are an evil man!'',' the entertainer said through faux tears on stage.

But the entertainer then shook it off, smiled and started what became a well-scripted 90 minute performance.

Glends Newell-Harris, the President of  The Links Incorporated, the charity who organised the show, said in a statement: 

'The scheduling of Mr. Cosby to perform at the Nassau (Bahamas) Chapter’s fundraiser was done in good faith and in advance of the allegations coming to light. 

'As a women’s organization committed to uplifting and empowering women, The Links, Incorporated does not tolerate crimes against women.

'Recent accusations against Bill Cosby are alarming and unsettling. We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct a thorough investigation. 

'The Links, Incorporated believes in the judicial system of the United States as well as every citizen’s right to due process.  

'Being that no formal charges have been filed against Mr. Cosby, we therefore don’t deem it appropriate to further comment on the accusations.

'Proceeds from the event benefitting The Links Foundation, Incorporated were generated from the sale of tickets purchased by community members who believe in and support the work of The Links Foundation, Incorporated.

A total of nine women have now come forward this month claiming the famed entertainer abused them. 

However he has cancelled upcoming shows in both Las Vegas and Arizona. 

The accusations has also caused Netflix and NBC to ax projects by the veteran comedian. 

He pulled out of scheduled slots with Queen Latifah and David Letterman and, when asked about the allegations in a November 6 interview with the Associated Press, said: 'There's no response ... I don't talk about it.' 

Severing all ties: When Hill was 19, she decided to end contact with Cosby and gave up her career as an aspiring actress 

Reaction: As new allegations surfaced against the comedian this week, he cancelled shows in Las Vegas and Arizona. He is yet to provide a response to the allegations
