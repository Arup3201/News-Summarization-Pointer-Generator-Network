The tragic death of Jill Meagher stunned Australia, but the horrific crime has led to the creation of a phone app that could save others in danger.

Gavin Lockwood from Canberra was as shocked as the rest of the country when the pretty Irish woman was violently raped and murdered while walking home from a pub in Brunswick, an inner suburb of Melbourne, in the early hours of September 22, 2012.

But instead of forgetting about the terrible incident, Lockwood decided to try and develop a mobile phone app that would help others in trouble in the future.

Mr Lockwood is a full-time sheet metal worker who works long hours. However, despite this he worked regularly in his spare time to make the free app that would allow users to request the help of other people nearby at the touch of a button. 

Later he teamed up with his friend Steve Thomas who helped develop the app further and he became his business partner on the project. 

The new mobile phone app was developed specifically to help others in trouble

After a year working on it all their hard work came to fruition when the Hawk Help app was finally finished. It is now available on iTunes and Google Play.

'What happened to Jill Meaher was shocking and it got my mind racing. I just thought there has to be something that can be developed that can help. That was where the idea originated from,"  Mr Lockwood said. 

'We spent the first six months developing the app and the next six months testing it and making sure it worked properly. I worked on the app in the evenings after I'd finished my job and on the weekends.'

The app works very simply. If someone feels threatened they just open the app and hit the help request button. This searches for a a range of up to 25 kilometres in the area. The app shows people how many other users are located within this radius, but this can be refined as more people download it.

'It'll send out a help request and if the person who receives it accepts the request they'll be given a map showing where the person is who has requested the help,' Mr Lockwood said.                                                                                                                                                       When activated Hawk Help can contact more that one person in the vicinity and is traceable. As well as Australia it is also available in New Zealand, China, India, Brazil, Italy and Qatar.

'The whole idea with the app is to create a community. Initially give it to someone you trust or are familiar with. Obviously the more people there are on board, the more people there'll be to assist in a time of need. It's about making your community safer," Mr Lockwood said. 

Hawk Help is user intuitive and uses the latest messaging technology for faster contact. 

It is suitable for women, men, children, the elderly and anyone whose work involves them being unaccompanied with others, people dating new people or anyone at risk in general.

'We're not trying to make heroes out of people or put them in any danger, it's more about having a presence and working together as a community,' Mr Lockwood explained.

'We don't want anyone to put themselves in danger, but rather to create a support network.'
