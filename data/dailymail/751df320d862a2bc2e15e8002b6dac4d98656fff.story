Dereck Chisora has revealed he plans to climb Ben Nevis before conquering Tyson Fury when the two finally fight on November 29.

The new dad, in public for the first time with baby daughter Angelina, convincingly lost to Fury when the rivals first met in July 2011.

Chisora entered the ring that night weighing 261lbs, the heaviest he has been, but is today significantly lighter and plans to conclude his preparations for the undefeated Fury by scaling Britain’s highest mountain.

‘I’m going to go and climb Ben Nevis,’ said Chisora, the European heavyweight champion.

‘It’s something me and my friend want to do. We’ve done it before. It’s something we do before every big fight.

‘Last time when we were boxing for a world title (against Vitali Klitschko in February 2012) me and my friend went skiing, people didn’t realise.

‘I took him to a mountain and it took us 20 minutes to get to the top. But we didn’t have the goggles or the gloves, we only had tracksuits. Everyone had all the gear and I said to my mate John: “You go first and I’ll follow you”.

‘I sent him down the mountain then thought “F*** this s*** – I’m going back in the car”. After 45 minutes he came back with scratches all over his face.

‘I told him we have to go to Ben Nevis this time and walk up it then back down. He can go first.

‘I want to go there and finish my runs – the weather is quite nice and they’ve got beautiful fresh air up there.’

The November 29 date with Fury, incidentally also for the vacant British title, represents the first time Chisora will enter the ring as a father.

His past antics, which include spitting and a press conference brawl with David Haye, means he is far from considered a role model, but he on Wednesday described fatherhood as ‘the best thing in the world’ and even joked that not only does he want Angelina to one day box, but also that Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger rejected his offer to be her godfather.

‘I love being a father,’ he said. ‘I think it’s the best thing in the world to be a dad and I hope she follows in my footsteps.

‘When you’re a dad you get guys who say “I don’t change nappies” but really and truly everyone changes nappies. If our own prince can change nappies then I can change nappies.

‘Has is softened me? No because I like the good things in life. I prefer to not be soft. She does it to me sometimes but I have to put it in check sometimes as well.

‘She’s six months old, her name is Angelina Viola – we named her after my mum and my other half’s mum and after the Rolling Stones song. I tried to get Mick Jagger to be the Godfather but he turned me down.

‘I get sleep don’t worry about that. I’ve got a big house and they (Chisora’s partner and daughter) sleep at the bottom.’
