Manchester United midfield Nick Powell has suffered yet another blow to his Old Trafford career after being told he faces weeks out with a hamstring injury.

Powell was highly-rated when United bought him from Crewe for £4million in the summer of 2012 but has struggled to break through in to the first team, making only two substitute appearances in the Barclays Premier League since then.

The 20-year-old had hoped that he may break through this spring after Louis van Gaal recalled him from loan at Leicester on the advice of his assistant Ryan Giggs.

However, a hamstring injury suffered by Powell in a recent reserve game has now been found to be relatively severe and Powell faces a number of weeks on the sidelines.

With his contract expiring in the summer of 2016, Powell will face a decision about his future at the end of the season.
