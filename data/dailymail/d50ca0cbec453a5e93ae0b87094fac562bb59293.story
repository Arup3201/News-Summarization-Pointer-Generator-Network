Duke University student Miriam Weeks - who made headlines earlier this year when it was revealed she performs in pornographic films under the name Belle Knox - has come out in support of legalizing prostitution.

In an op-ed column for Rolling Stone, Weeks announces that she is 'proud to classify [herself] as a sex worker.'

Weeks writes 'The time has come for the world's oldest profession to be legalized in the so-called Land of the Free for public health, safety and opportunity.'

Adult film star: Weeks decided to perform in pornographic films as a way of covering her college tuition

Weeks, emphasizing a separation between sex work and human trafficking, claims 'The fact of the matter is that most sex workers enter the industry via their own consent and genuinely enjoy their work.' 

Weeks decided to perform in pornographic films as a way of covering her college tuition, was flown to Los Angeles by a company in order to perform over the Thanksgiving holiday -- and the next semester was outed by a classmate that had spied her work, after he earlier said he would keep her alter ego a secret, Rolling Stone reported in April. 

Weeks told the music magazine that a number of issues she dealt with growing up - going to parties, her nude photos being spread, committing self-harm due to depression - were not factors for her adult film career.

In the past year, she appeared multiple times on television, speaking on 'Piers Morgan Tonight,' 'The View,' and 'Dr. Drew on Call,' wrote a number of essays for the women's website xoJane, and also landed an internship with Pornhub.com. 

'In porn, I can speak openly about my experiences without fear of punishment, work in a safe and professional environment and play a vital role in the creative process,' she says in her Rolling Stone column. 'Of course, not everyone can be a porn star, but more sex workers could enjoy this same level of autonomy and fulfillment if prostitution was legalized.' 

Weeks argues in her column that safer sex workers and reduced rates of sexually transmitted diseases are linked to legalized prostitution

Weeks argues in her column that safer sex workers and reduced rates of sexually transmitted diseases are linked to legalized prostitution, citing research from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The adult film actress also dismisses the 'Swedish model,' in which clients who seek out prostitution are prosecuted.

She writes 'Every client and sex worker has a story to tell, and the current regime of criminalization over compassion only mutes their voices and pushes them to the fringes of society where danger may lurk.

'Although porn is legal, I am nonetheless proud to classify myself a sex worker and call on my colleagues to stand up for our right to make a living, access the same protections as everyone else and not feel ashamed for doing honest work. We are nobody's rescue project, and we deserve rights, not handcuffs.'
