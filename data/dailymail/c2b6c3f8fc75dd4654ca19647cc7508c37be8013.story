Cristiano Ronaldo returned to training at Real Madrid a hero after winning the Ballon d'Or award for a second successive year.

The Portuguese superstar showed off the shiny golden award to coach Carlo Ancelotti and his team-mates after seeing off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to win the world's best player crown for a third time.

He was joined by James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Sergio Ramos, who also had silverware to show off after Monday night's glittering ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland.

Colombian star Rodriguez won the Puskas Award for best goal following his sensational strike against Uruguay at the World Cup last summer.

Ramos and Kroos, meanwhile, were named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for 2014 along with Angel di Maria, who moved from Real to Manchester United over the summer.

Despite leading Real to their elusive 10th European Cup success, Ancelotti missed out on the coach of the year award which went to German World Cup-winner Joachim Low.

Ronaldo, 29, was the hot favourite to claim the main prize after an outstanding 2014 that saw him score 61 goals for club and country, provid 22 assists and claim nine club and individual honours.

He played an integral part as Real won the Champions League, rounding off a 4-1 win over city rivals Atletico Madrid in May's Lisbon final.

Real also won the Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Averaging a goal every 62 minutes in La Liga during the calendar year of 2014, Ronaldo also claimed the top scorer trophy.

Among the many medals acquired by Ronaldo in 2014 was the UEFA Super Cup in August 

Ronaldo was a clear winner with 37.66 per cent of total votes cast by a panel made up of captains, coaches and media members from all FIFA affiliate associations. Messi took second with 15.76 per cent, just ahead of Neuer on 15.72.

Ronaldo said: 'I am extremely happy and proud to receive this award and I want to keep challenging myself every day.

'Of course this is something that is always with me. I want to become one of the greatest players of all time and this requires a lot of effort but I hope to get there.'

James Rodriguez, who arrived at the Bernabeu in the summer, claimed the Puskas Award for his stunning strike for Colombia against Uruguay at the World Cup.

He saw off competition from Holland and Manchester United striker Robin van Persie and Irish women's player Stephanie Roche to win the award.

Ramos and Kroos took their place in the World XI alongside Neuer, David Luiz, Thiago Silva, Philipp Lahm, Di Maria, Andres Iniesta, Messi, Ronaldo and Arjen Robben. 

February 11 - Getting straight back to record-breaking business after clinching his second Ballon d'Or a month earlier, Ronaldo surpassed Luis Aragones' achievements in the history of Copa del Rey games between Real and Atletico Madrid by scoring a brace against the Rojiblancos. 

Aragones had scored five goals for Atleti but his record had remained unchallenged since the 1970s. More intriguingly Ronaldo's first goal in the derby, a penalty in the seventh minute, meant the Portuguese had scored in every possible minute of a 90-minute game.

May 24 - Ronaldo had been conspicuous by his absence from the scoresheet but it looked like Real had managed to do enough to thwart city rivals Atletico at the end of a dramatic Champions League final in Lisbon. However, he would make his mark in the 121st minute of play, scoring the penalty that made it 4-1 and rubber-stamped 'La Decima'. It was also his 17th goal in that season's tournament, a new record.

October 25 - An opening goal against title rivals Barcelona was Ronaldo's 15th in his last seven league games and broke a Real record set by Hungary great Ferenc Puskas in both the 1959-60 and 1960-61 campaigns. Puskas had scored 13 times through seven consecutive league games.

December 6 - Ronaldo's 23rd hat-trick in Real colours, this time plundered at the expense of Celta Vigo, was not only a Primera Division record but meant the Portuguese had become the fastest player in La Liga history to score 200 goals.

December 20 - His Barcelona rival Lionel Messi might have beaten him to the title of all-time Champions League goalscorer, but Ronaldo was hardly complaining when his 72nd Champions League goal - scored in a 4-0 thumping of Ludogorets - boosted him beyond Real stalwart Raul's previous competition record. He is three goals behind Messi, but now only one Ballon d'Or behind the Argentinian.
