Gabi Jones, 29, is almost four times the weight of an average woman her age.

Weighing in at 620lbs (44 st, 3lb) Gabi, from Denver, is super-morbidly obese but rather than trying to lose weight she is deliberately trying to add pounds to her frame, thinking of her body as a piece of art work.

She has been gaining weight deliberately since she reached 250lbs (18st) and is now what is known as a ‘gainer’, a woman who embraces being severely overweight and strives to be even larger.

Gabi Jones, 29, currently weighs over 620lbs but is deliberately trying to get larger 

Gabi says: ‘I don’t know when I’m going to stop but I still want to be able to walk. I think walking is important.

'I’m not like everyone else. My body is voluptuous, my body is sexy. I think fat is art and I’m a masterpiece in the making.

'It’s about me growing softer. It‘s about the added pounds and my arms getting jigglier.

‘For me gaining is art, it’s beautiful. I am like a Picasso, I want to change society.’

Unbelievably Gabi claims that she is aware of the extreme health dangers of her size, but still refuses to stop gaining weight. She also understands that her love of obesity is at odds with society’s view of normality. 

Unlike many women, Gabi relishes the jiggle of her arm fat, considering her huge body a 'work of art'

'I get grief from people pretty much every day of my life about my body and my size,' she adds.

‘I know people who are bigger die younger, I’ve accepted that. A lot of people said I would only make it until I was 25 but I’ve made it until I’m 29 and I believe I will make it until I’m at least 40', she says. 

Bullied since childhood about her size, Gabi fought her weight for years until she discovered the world of gainers and the thousands of men who love large women. 

Kenyan, 18, from Kansas, is one such man.

Explaining his unusual obsession he says: ‘Every aspect of being fat is attractive to me. I couldn’t really say why but I love it and it is part of me.’ 

Gabi runs a website for fat admirers and her particular draw is her stomach, which overhangs almost to her knees in an ‘upside down heart shape’

He is one of thousands of men who pay to log onto Gabi’s website, where she runs a business catering to an army of fat admirers by posting pictures and videos of herself. 

Men often request videos which see Gabi playing with her stomach fat, rubbing body lotion on it or shaking it in what is known as ‘belly play’.

Known as ‘Gaining Gabi’, Kenyan has become a huge fan: ‘She looks like the living embodiment of the goddess,’ he adds. 

In the market for a ‘feeder’ or a man who wants to intentionally feed a woman to make her bigger, Gabi gets visits from Kenyan who will cook and feed her a meal.

'Being able to feed Gabi is just amazing', he explains, 'I mean some people would say it's just too disgusting but it is heaven to me.

'It's definitely sexual but its not like "oh I want to feed you and have sex with you", it's more like "I want to feed you and get you bigger and more beautiful and treat you like a goddess." 

Her fans enjoy feeding and then being squashed by Gabi so that thay can enjoy her full weight

The pair also engage in 'squashing' where Gabi sits on Kenyan to allow him to fully feel her weight himself.

'It's like an elephant sitting on a rabbit,' Gabi says.

But Kenyan loves his experience of squashing: 'I like feeling the weight. I mean you can see it on the scale but it kind of hits home when a woman sits on you how successful you are as a feeder.'

He now hopes to take his feeder relationship with Gabi further. 

'I would like to be physical but at the same time I don't want to rush things. I've rushed things in the past and they haven't worked out and I really want this.'
