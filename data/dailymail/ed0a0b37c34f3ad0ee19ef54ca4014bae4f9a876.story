Newcastle manager Alan Pardew admits the past fortnight has not been kind to his squad as he prepares a makeshift defence for Saturday’s visit of QPR.

The Magpies – who have not conceded for nearly six hours – have lost skipper Fabricio Coloccini to a calf injury and defensive sidekick Steven Taylor is struggling with a knee problem.

That means Pardew will start with Paul Dummett and Mike Williamson at the heart of his rearguard at the weekend.

Williamson himself has been missing because of injury in recent weeks, while Dummett has operated at left back for the large part.

And Pardew, who has also lost midfielders Mehdi Abeid (broken toe) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) and remains without Cheick Tiote (calf), said: ‘It seems like a very long time since we last played. We had some great results but we've also suffered some injuries.

‘We are still missing some on Saturday, but hopefully we can keep the run going.’

Academy graduate Dummett has emerged as a surprise star in recent weeks, and Pardew added: ‘Paul Dummett has done brilliantly for us and he will play there (centre back) again.

‘And if he carries on the way he has then we will be absolutely fine.’

Pardew, whose side have won five on the spin, went on: ‘Considering our start to the season we have done really well.

‘The mood in the camp is buoyant and although we've had injuries during the winning spell we've managed to overcome them. Our youngsters deserve a lot of credit as do the senior guys.

‘There's a bit more expectation on us than in previous weeks and the QPR match is a different kind of hurdle for our young players.’
