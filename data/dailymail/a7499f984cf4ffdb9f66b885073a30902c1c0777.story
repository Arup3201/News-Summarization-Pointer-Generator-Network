A stand-up comic has been pictured with comedy stars including Phill Jupitus and John Bishop is a convicted paedophile who filmed himself spanking a 15-year-old boy.

Russell Haynes, 42, whose Instagram account shows him with a host of stars, spent two years behind bars for indecent assault and possession of hundreds of paedophile pictures.

Then a gymnastics coach, Haynes had tied up his victim, a 15-year-old boy, and filmed the youngster performing a number of lewd sex acts, The Sun reports.

Revealing his conviction to fans and friends today, the paedophile told his fans and friends that some 'positives' had come from his conviction.

Haynes said: 'There are a lot of positives that has [sic] come out of this. 

'I met my partner who has stood by me despite people trying to tear her down. I have two kids that are the most amazing thing in my life as well as her. I made some really great friends and I found my love of comedy which in many ways as help me be in such a happy place right now. I didn't have any of that at the time.  

'I don't know what will happen next. I want to move on. I ... will try and use my experience for positivity and hopefully i can still do comedy. One of the things I want to do is a show about everything I went through.'

He added: '12 years ago I made the worst choices of my life. Something I will always regret. I got myself into a situation that should never had happen I make no excuses. I hurt someone. I have to live with that.'

There was a furious reaction from some fans, while a promoter suggested venues would not be willing to host his shows in future.

Tom Fowler, from Actz Entertainment, wrote on Facebook: 'Russ i have booked you before supporting Lee Nelson, and have met you a few times and you come across as a very nice guy BUT this has changed everything. 

'We as an agency work for some of the biggest entertainment bookers in the UK and there is no way they would book you into any of their venues or will we going forward. This may see seem shortsighted to some people but its FACTS and feel that other bookers will feel the same. It just makes you realise you don't really know anyone.'

Nabil Obineche wrote: 'If you ever bump into me at a gig, don't try to greet me, do not even look at me. No doubt you'll gain some infamy from this but you knew that. You also knew you'd get all the abuse you'll no doubt get when you took up comedy too so man up and take it. YOU aren't the victim here.'

While some fans defended Haynes for admitting he was convicted of being a paedophile, the day it was revealed in the Sun on Sunday, Paul Dunn wrote: 'Sickening. All of it; what happened & the arse kissing on here. Turning my stomach.'

The father-of-two from South London, who remains on the Sex Offenders' Register, is a regular on the UK comedy circuit, rubbing shoulders with such luminaries as Sean Lock, Russell Kane, Lee Nelson and Jenny Eclair.

MailOnline contacted representatives for Bishop, Jupitus, Eclair, Lock, Kane and Nelson for comment, but none were available on Sunday afternoon.

Haynes was jailed in 2008 at Inner London Crown Court where he admitted indecent assault and making hundreds of indecent images and videos of children.

He targeted youngsters while running the Camberwell Gymnastics Club in south-east London, where he was director, coach and, ironically, child protection officer.

Haynes's trial revealed he had groomed his underage victim after setting up a chat forum for teenagers on which he posed as a girl called 'Jenny' to entice the boy to send him explicit pictures, the Sun reports.

He then convinced the boy, a regular at the club from the age of seven, to share a room with him on club trips and encouraged him to strip and perform gymnastics naked or in women's underwear while Haynes took photographs.

Police officers recovered 175 computer files containing more than 1,000 indecent images of children when they raided his home. One filmed clip showed Haynes spanking the boy.

Haynes took up his current profession as a stand-up comic on his release from jail in 2009. According to his personal website he now does as many as seven performances a week.

In June he shared a bill with Russell Kane at a gig in Southend in Essex. Kane is best known for appearing on BBC Three's Live At The Electric.

Speaking to Sun On Sunday, Haynes called his paedophilia 'the biggest regret of my life'.

'It all happened ten years ago and fortunately I've moved on,' he told the paper. 'I'm not going to do anything that wrecks that.'
