Forget walkies, this debonair dog's more likely to be doing wheelies.

Video captured by Chris Hayes at the Los Gatos Creek Trail in California shows a white fluffy dog cruising along in a miniature Mercedes.

The pup doesn't appear to have a care in the world as his whizzes along a tarmac path with the breeze blowing in his fur.

Hayes said the convertible car appeared to be driven remotely.

It seems to have been specially adapted for a small passenger.

However, it still has all of the essential features, including a personalized number plate and cup holder.

The dog is seen driving along with a can of soda close to his paw.

It is not know who the hound belongs too, but judging by his sweet ride he's likely to have a palatial pad to match.
