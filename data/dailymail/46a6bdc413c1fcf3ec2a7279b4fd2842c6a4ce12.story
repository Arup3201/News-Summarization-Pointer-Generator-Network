Out for walkies, tiny Tyson's little legs don't look like they'll get him too far. 

But the energetic chihuahua and Ihasa cross's miniature frame could well put him in the running for the title of Britain's smallest dog. 

The five-month-old pup weighs 13oz and stands 4in tall to the shoulder. His owner Rosemarie McLinden cannot find a collar to fit him - so took him for a walk on a ferret harness.

'He is so delicate he doesn't run around as much as other puppies but he still does like to give a chew toy a good bashing,' she said. 

Tyson was rejected by his siblings at birth and struggled to get his mother's attention, so Mrs McLinden, 46, of Keal, Lincolnshire, fed him by hand. 

The mother-of-four said: 'We had to take him from the litter...they think of him as a squeaky toy.' 

She and her husband Anthony, 47, a bus driver, believe Tyson is the smallest dog in Britain but have yet to contact Guinness World Records about him. 

The puppy, pictured with the McLinden family's golden retriever, weighs just 13oz and was rejected by his litter at birth 

The tiny dog, who shrinks when he is wet, had to be fed by hand by Mrs McLinden who has four children 

Unable to find a collar to fit him, Mrs McLinden walked the puppy in a ferret's harness near her home in Keal 

When he was born the pup was treated 'like a squeaky toy' by the rest of the litter, Mrs McLinden said 

While the family has not yet contacted the Guinness World Records, they are confident Tyson is the smallest dog in Britain 

'He hasn't grown any taller although he's filled out,' Mrs McLinden said. 

'When he's bathed he shrinks to nothing because he is all fur.' 

But Tyson is still bigger than the world's smallest living dog, a female chihuahua called Miracle Milly, who is 3.8in tall and weighs 1lb. 

She sleeps in a doll's crib at her owner's home in Dorado, Puerto Rico.
