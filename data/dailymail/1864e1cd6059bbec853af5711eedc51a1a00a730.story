Happy reunion: Mary Plumb was recently reunited with her family's 100-pound African-spurred tortoise after it traveled 30 miles away and lived on the lam for a full year

An Arizona family has finally been reunited with their giant African tortoise after it wandered 30 miles from home and lived a year on the lam.

The sulcata, or African-spurred tortoise, named Samson took off from an exotic animal farm owned by George and Mary Plumb in November 2012.

After traveling 30 miles in about six months, the 100-pound reptile spent another half year with a foster owner before an online ad and a microchip implant recently helped the Plumbs get him back.

According to Mary Plumb, Samson’s saga began when someone caring for him and the dozens of other animals her family keeps near Casa Grande left a gate open.

Plumb believes Samson first sauntered over to a nearby alfalfa farm before making his 6-month, 30-mile trek to Maricopa, where he was adopted by Intel engineer and amateur herpetologist Jonathan Grove.

Sulcatas are herbivores and originally come from the hot, dry grasslands south of the Sahara Desert in Africa. They can live up to 200 years. While known for their friendly and gentle natures, they can grow up to 3 feet long and tip the scale at 150 pounds.

After another six months, Grove renewed his search for Samson’s—who he’d renamed Eddie—owners.

African spurred tortoises live in sub Saharan African grasslands.

They are herbivores that live largely on grasses.

The reptiles can measure up to 36 inches long and weigh 240 pounds.

They are the thrid largest tortoises in the world and can live over 100 years.

‘I went all over Hidden Valley handing out fliers, (but) basically all the people who called couldn't describe Eddie,’ Grove said. ‘Eddie's shell was so perfect that he was probably worth a lot of money. I really didn't want somebody to come and flip him and put him on Craigslist.’

Meanwhile, the Maricopa Monitor posts Eddie as ‘pet of the week’ in the middle of November.

It turns out Grove's hunt was a little off. Just west of Casa Grande, news of a missing tortoise rings alarm bells for George and Mary Plumb. They can't find their tortoise anywhere.

‘We kind of gave up on the big male,’ George said. ‘I assumed someone picked him up. We didn't worry too much because he was microchipped.’

George drove to Maricopa to inspect Eddie, and the big sulcata immediately responded to his voice.

The microchip embedded in the animal's skin confirmed Eddie was actually Samson.

So, how does a tortoise wander 30-some miles in six months?

‘They are very big explorers, especially the males,’ Mary said. The four tortoises at her home like to burrow under fences.

A lovely time had by all: Samson not only rejoined the plumbs, but also his lifelong pal Goliath

'They are an instant love¿: Mary Plumb hopes to will the long-lived pets to her grandchildren one day

The Plumb family owns a menagerie of animals on their property just west of Casa Grande. Neighborhood kids and children from churches and schools come to see the animals, more than 73 in all. In addition to the tortoises, the Plumbs own a wide array of peacocks, guinea hens, chickens and snakes.

But the male tortoises are special. George rescued one 19 years ago from a busy road, effectively launching his turtle obsession.

The large land-crawlers even have mates. In August, 12 babies hatched from eggs burrowed in the ground. The couple intends to give the hatchlings to their future grandchildren. They don't even have grandchildren yet, but their four teenage boys know what's expected down the road.

But Mary’s not too worried they'll stray from the family tradition.

‘They are an instant love,’ she said.
