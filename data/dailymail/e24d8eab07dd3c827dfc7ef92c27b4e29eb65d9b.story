Patrick Rock, a key advisor to the Prime Minister, has been arrested on suspicion of child porn offences

The Downing Street aide arrested on child porn offences could be the victim of ‘revenge or jealousy’, a relative of Patrick Rock has claimed.

Simon Rock de Besombes said he was ‘shocked’ by his cousin’s resignation from Number 10 and subsequent arrest, and insisted his cousin ‘to date he is innocent’.

Patrick Rock was arrested almost three weeks ago after Number 10 called in the National Crime Agency to investigate a potential offence linked to child abuse images.

Detectives from the National Crime Agency searched No 10 and were given access to government offices and IT systems, but the operation was kept secret until details were leaked to the Mail this week.

Mr Cameron has said he was ‘profoundly shocked’ by the allegations against Mr Rock, with whom he worked as Tory advisers in John Major’s government.

Mr Rock has not spoken publicly about the allegations since his arrest. He has not been charged.

His relative Mr Rock de Besombes said: ‘I am shocked. I know my cousin and nothing I know of him has anything to do with this. To date he is innocent. There are no charges against him [but] nobody is defending him.

‘The fact that he chose to resign is a noble decision and shows that he is innocent.

‘Men of power can have many enemies. It could have been jealousy, it could have been revenge. It could have been many things,’ he told the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Rock de Besombes, who lives in Normandy, added: ‘My cousin isn’t here. Perhaps he is in France, perhaps he is in the UK. Between February 13 and today we might have been in contact but since the scandal erupted I have had no news from him.’

As deputy head of the Downing Street policy unit, Mr Rock was one of the most senior figures in Mr Cameron’s inner circle.

Mr Rock, 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West London.

He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de Besombes.

His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms.

Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is 'profoundly shocked' by the arrest of his old friend

As a teenager, Mr Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied history.

After graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing director of the Retail Consortium.

It is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote.

The government has faced mounting questions about why it took almost three weeks for the arrest to be made public, and only after a leak to the Daily Mail.

Number 10 says it first became aware 
of allegations against Mr Rock on February 12, when it called in the NCA
 and informed the Prime Minister.

 Mr Rock later resigned and in the early hours of February 13 was arrested by the police.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has defended Number 10's decision not to make the arrest public

Officers then entered Downing Street and were given access to official computer systems.

Labour is also demanding to know how much time elapsed between Number 10 being aware of a potential offence, Mr Rock resigning and the police being called in.

It comes amid suggestions that informing Mr Rock of the alleged offence amounted to a ‘tip-off’ of his impending arrest.

Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, called on the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate.

He said there were legitimate concerns ‘given that Mr Rock had a senior role at the heart of Government and was privy to the most sensitive information, and that he has had a very close working relationship with the Prime Minister over a number of years’.

Mr Ashworth asked: ‘When were Mr Rock's colleagues in No. 10 informed that he had resigned, and why was the fact of his resignation not made public immediately?

‘What were officials in No. 10 and in other departments with which he had contact told about the reasons for Mr Rock's absence from work?’

In response Sir Jeremy said: ‘Downing Street became aware of a potential offence relating to child abuse imagery on the evening of 12 February.  I was immediately informed of the allegation and the Prime Minister was also briefed. 

‘Officials then contacted the NCA to seek advice on how to report suspected criminality. Our subsequent actions were driven by the overriding importance of not jeopardising either their investigation or the possibility of a prosecution.

‘Patrick Rock resigned on the evening of 12 February. His resignation was not made public as we judged it was inappropriate to make an announcement while the NCA investigations were continuing.

‘A few hours later he was arrested. We also arranged for officers to come into Number 10 to have access to all IT systems and offices they considered relevant.

‘There has been no contact from officials with Mr Rock since his arrest. ‘
