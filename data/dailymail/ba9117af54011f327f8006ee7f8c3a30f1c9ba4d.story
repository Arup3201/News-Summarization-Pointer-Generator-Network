Making a statement: Luq Mughal, 21, turned his tuition in using only single dollar bills

A college student in Utah has taken an unusual path for a protest against rising tuition costs by paying for the upcoming semester in single dollar bills.

Luq Mughal is a student at the University of Utah and already gets a discounted rate because he is an in-state student and his father is a member of the faculty.

He still finds the cost of school to be overwhelming, especially as a new 5 per cent hike was approved by the school's board of trustees.

'The people making the prices are not actually aware of how hard it is on the students,' he told The Salt Lake Tribune.

The 21-year-old decided to mark this visual protest because he struggles to meet his financial costs which include cost of living expenses on top of tuition.

'By no means am I the saddest story on campus. Thereâ€™s a lot of people here just as bad and probably worse,' he told the paper.

Mr Mughal, who works on the weekends in order to earn his tuition money, had to stop by several different banks in order to collect the 2,000 $1-bills that he needed to make his point when he turned in the money in time for the Tuesday tuition deadline.

Rising costs: University of Utah's tuition increased by 5% last year, which is more than the average 2.9% for four-year in-state programs across the country

Though he was alone in his protest this year, more students have given assurances to support him next year.

It doesn't seem like the problem is going anywhere either as in-state tuition to the Salt Lake City school has more than doubled over the past decade from $2,742 for the 2002-2003 school year to $6,511 for this years' students.

The school did not put out a specific statement in response to the complaints, but told the Salt Lake Tribune that the school is regularly ranked as being one of the highest-value institutions of higher learning.

According to The College Board, Utah stands below the national average for public university college tuition.

The average annual tuition for a four-year in-state program was $8,893 this year.

That rate increased by 2.9 per cent from the 2012-2013 school year.
