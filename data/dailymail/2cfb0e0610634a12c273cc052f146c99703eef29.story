A dog has donned a wing suit to become the world's first ever BASE jumping canine.

Four-year-old Whisper flew through the air after being strapped on to the back of his owner Dean Potter.

The video, part of a feature called When Dogs Fly, has been posted on the internet, and although it has been met with largely positive responses, it has led to some concerns about the safety of the dog.

The clip for a feature sponsored by Adidas shows Mr Potter, 42, rigging Whisper up on a guide wire to get him on to a rocky ledge.

Mr Potter then follows him down and the pair look out at the jump they are about to conquer.

The miniature Australian cattle dog is then tightly secured in Mr Potter’s backpack with just his head protruding.

Then his wing-suited owner leaps off the side of the 13,020ft Eiger mountain in Switzerland.

The pair hurtle towards the ground before deploying a parachute.

Whisper, who is wearing tiny googles to protect his eyes, looks content during the experience.

When he is helped out of the backpack he shakes his body out, before jumping around and wagging his tail.

Mr Potter's website details the many adventures he has with Whisper who has lived with him since he was aged eight weeks.

The pair live in Yosemite National Park and near the beach in Santa Barbara.

Mr
 Potter says: 'Whisper has lots of adventures everywhere we live. She’s 
an incredible ocean swimmer and has learned how to read waves, like 
surfers do.

'She’s an excellent climber and has climbed Royal Arches almost entirely on her own (roped-up, of course).

'We
 also travel a lot and this past summer, Whisper did her first alpine 
mountaineering and summited a number of peaks in the Swiss Alps, 
including the Eiger and the Jungfrau. She was harnessed and roped 
between my girlfriend and I.

'She
 did all of the climbing herself, crossed cravasses, navigated snowy 
ridgelines, climbed short sections of vertical rock and ice and summited
 with joy.'

A spokesman for the RSPCA told MailOnline: 'Although both the dog and owner land safely, being strapped to a person's back and dropped by parachute is likely to be a cause of significant stress and fear for the dog.

'Dogs have very complex needs and it is up to owners to ensure all their dogs needs are met and that their dog does not experience stress.'

BASE jumping is an activity in which participants leap off tall, static objects and use a parachute to break their fall.

The term 'BASE' is an acronym for 'buildings, antennas, spans and earth.'

There have been several deaths from BASE jumping in recent years as the pastime gains in popularity - at least 10 people across the world have died taking part in the activity this year.
