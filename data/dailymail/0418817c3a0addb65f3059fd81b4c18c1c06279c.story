Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky easily won election by fellow Republicans on Thursday to become Senate majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January, fulfilling a long-held ambition. 

As majority leader, McConnell will set the Senate's agenda. Along with House Speaker John Boehner, who was reelected to the top spot in the House today, McConnell will decide what legislation is sent to the White House in the final two years of President Barack Obama's term.

Also reelected to his party's leadership today was current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who will slide into the minority leader position at the beginning of next year.

Couldn't be happier: Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, front, fulfilled a long-held ambition today when he was unanimously elected by his party to become the next majority leader of the Senate. He currently serves as minority leader, but he'll take the top spot in January when the next legislative session begins

McConnell, 72, was chosen by acclamation at a closed-door meeting of the rank and file this morning. 

The Kentucky lawmaker was elected to a sixth Senate term last week in off-year elections in which Republicans gained a majority for the first time in eight years.

He will formally assume his duties as majority leader in January. Democrats have assailed him in recent campaigns as a guardian of gridlock for his opposition to nearly all of President Barack Obama's initiatives. 

Senate Republicans had only one contested leadership race, and that was for chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Current chairman, Jerry Moran of Kansas, was not interested in retaining the position.

In the end, Republicans selected Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi to chair the party's campaign committee for the 2016 elections. He defeated Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada.

Wicker said at a press conference afterward that it was always a 'race between friends' and 'a contest decided among friends,' and the two men began and ended the election process that way.

A relatively unknown lawmaker, it will now become Wicker's duty to help Republicans retain the Senate beyond their current two-year mandate. 

Republican members of the Senate also reelected Texas Sen. John Cornyn to the party's whip spot, Wyoming Sen. John Barasso as chairman of the policy committee, South Dakota Sen. John Thune to GOP conference chairman and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt to vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference.

While the voting sessions were celebratory occasions for Republicans, they were the exact opposite for Democrats, who took a pounding in the Nov. 4 midterm elections.

After eight years in the minority, Senate Republicans picked up at least eight seats from Democrats and are still hoping for a ninth in a Louisiana runoff set for Dec. 6.

The party also padded its majority in the House, where a handful of races remain unresolved. Republicans are on track to equal or eclipse the 246 they won in 1946, a figure that stands as a post-World War II high.

Despite sizable election losses, Democrats appeared ready to hand their own leaders another two years at the helm on Thursday, postponing a generational change that appears not far in the future.

Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, a few weeks shy of his 75th birthday, was selected as the minority leader in the new Congress, but members of the rank and file made it known they were unhappy with his leadership in the last election cycle.

First elected as Democratic leader in 2004, at least two senators, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia wanted to see a change in management and asked for the leadership vote to be delayed by a week.

But the vote was held any way, and so they refused to vote for Reid in order to send a message to their colleagues.

'We’ve got to stick to our knitting and make sure that we’re talking about things that we want to do for the American people instead of talking about winning elections,' McCaskill told reporters after the meeting, according to the Washington Post.

'That means making this place functional again and working with our Republican colleagues.'

The end result of the three and a half-hour meeting was that Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive favorite, was given a seat at the leadership table in a newly created position.

According to the Huffington Post, she will become an adviser to the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and will help shape the party's positions on issues and legislative priorities. 

A source familiar with the discussions told the news publication that Warren will also serve as a liason to progressive groups.

Also added to leadership was Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who will becme the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee chairwoman. 

Sen. John Tester, a second-term moderate from Montana, was selected to head of the party's Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for 2016.

'We’re going to expand our leadership, we’re going to do things a little differently, a little different approach,' Reid said when he emerged from the closed-door meeting.

Remaining at the top of the party's pecking order are Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the assistant Democratic leader, New York Sen. Charles 'Chuck' Schumer, vice chair of the Democratic conference and chair of the Democratic policy committee, Washington Sen. Patty Murray, secretary of the Democratic Conference and Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, vice chair of the policy committee. 

Hard knock: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was selected by his colleagues to lead the party again next year, but because of last Tuesday's midterm election losses he will be demoted to minority leader of the Senate in the new Congress

Leading progressive voice Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was added to her party's leadership slate today. The Massachusetts senator will serve as an adviser to their policy committee and a liaison to progressives

At the same time, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, 74, is expected to be elected to a new term as House Democratic leader when the rank-and-file meets next week. She first won her post a dozen years ago.

Pelosi was speaker for four years when Democrats held the majority, and has served as minority leader for eight. 

She said during a press conference today that she would not step aside as her party's leader despite the recent losses and finds it sexist that reporters would even ask her about it when they made no such overtures to the men who lead the Republican Party when they were on the losing side.

House Republicans held their leadership elections today, and as expected, no major shake-ups occurred. 

The Speaker's gavel stayed with Boehner of Ohio, and Kevin McCarthy of California will remain the party's majority leader,a position he won this summer after the previous holder, former Rep. Eric Cantor, lost his primary election and subsequently left Congress before the end of his term.

When McCarthy moved up in leadership, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise took his position as the party's whip, a job he was reelected today today. The Houses's campaign committee chair, Greg Walden of Oregon, and conference chair, Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, were also reelected.

The only change to leadership was the replacement of Oklahoma Rep. James Lankford as policy committee chair. Senator-elect Lankford will be succeeded by first-term Indiana Rep. Luke Messer.

While none of the Republican leaders faced public opposition before today's closed-door meetings, they could hand their hands full come January as they try to wrangle votes and keep the conservative wing of the GOP in line.

Asked about potential tension between the establishment members and the Tea Party faction in the Senate, Thune said the GOP's coalitions in the Senate understand that they have to stick together.

'We know that in order for us to succeed we’re going to have to function as a team and I think that gives you a renewed sense of purpose,' Thune told reporters today, according to the Dallas Morning News. 

'Those things tend to be more evident in the minority, but in the majority – for sure we’re going to have disagreements. We have different folks who come from different places and have different views on issues, he added.

'But when it comes to being successful in terms of trying to move an agenda I think we all recognize we have to work together as a team.'

As for as working with Democrats goes, Thune said at a press conference today, 'It's gonna be up to them. The ball's gonna be in their court.'

The South Dakota Republican said that members of his party 'look forward to bipartisan cooperation' and getting the 'peoples' government' working again. 

Likewise, Blunt said he was 'optimistic' that Democrats and Republicans could come to an agreement on a number of issues.

'Frankly, the president's going to engage one way or another,' he said, turning serious.

'He'll either have to engage the day the bill lines up on his desk....or decide to engage earlier in a way that we might be able to do hard things together,' Blunt argued.

The GOP leader said its important the Senate gets 'those hard things out of the way' so it can focus on passing laws that aid private sector job creation, which leads to good take-home pay.

Acknowledging that in just two years it will be Republicans who have 24 seats to defend in the Senate, Wicker told reporters that 'winning in 2016 begins with good government and good legislation,' and that's how Republicans plan to lead.
