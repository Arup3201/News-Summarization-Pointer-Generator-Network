This is the dramatic moment that a racing driver flipped his car twice in a 120mph crash and landed sideways in a ditch.

Wallace Menzies walked away with just bruises and a broken cheekbone after the crash, which happened while he was competing in the century-old Shelsey Walsh hillclimb race in Worcestershire

The 42-year-old driver was left precariously balanced in the wreck of his
 hillclimb car for more than three quarters of an hour as race officials and medics battled 
to free him and take him to hospital.

Shocking: The dramatic moment capturing racing driver Wallace Menzies flipping his car whilst doing 120mph

Mr Menzie's DJ Firestorm car had careered off the closed public road yesterday after he lost control, and it struck a high verge to the driver’s right.

It was sent flying through the air and flipped twice before ploughing into the side of the steep hillside.

The driver was taken to hospital but was discharged just a few hours later having suffered a broken cheekbone, cuts to his face and bruised shoulders.

Tim
 Mason, from Malvern, Worcestershire, who managed to take photographs of
 the crash, said the entire crowd of spectators held their breath as the
 car left the road.

The 43-year-old IT consultant, who was
 at the event with his five-year-old son Ben, said: 'I’ve been going to 
Shelsley since I was a kid, and now my son is mad about cars he loves 
coming with me.

'I’ve seen 
quite a few crashes in my time there, but never, ever, anything like 
this one. Thank God he was in a modern race car with a safety tested 
carbon fibre tub, or I really don’t think he would be with us now.

Great escape: Racing driver Wallace Menzies walked away from this mangled wreck with just bruises and a broken cheekbone after he flipped his car twice in a 120mph crash and landed sideways in a ditch

Loss of control: Menzies, 42, was competing in the century-old Shelsey Walsh hillclimb race in Worcestershire when he lost control of his DJ Firestorm car on a bend

Drama: Mr Menzie's car had careed off the closed public road yesterday and struck a verge to driver's right

'My
 son was watching the speed trap they have just before the corner and 
reading out the speeds and the car before him was doing 136mph.

'I
 think he must have been doing 125mph at least when he left the road. He
 just lost control and hit the bank, that sent the car into the air and 
he just somersaulted down the road.

'When he came to a rest the marshals were there straight away, but it still took an age to get him out.

'We
 all held our breath I think, and when they eventually got him out and 
he put a thumb up above the blankets everyone was so relieved.

Force: The car was sent flying through the air and flipped twice before ploughing into the side of the hillside

Action: Mr Menzies, who currently sits fifth in the British Hillclimb Championship, had been racing at the historic event, which has been run since 1905

'I just happened to have my shutter open when the crash happened.'

Mr
 Menzies, who currently sits fifth in the British Hillclimb 
Championship, had been racing at the historic Shelsley Walsh event.

The
 race, which snakes 1000 yards up a Worcestershire hillside, is the 
oldest hillclimb event in the world having run continuously since 1905.

Help: Mr Menzies was left precariously balanced in the wreck of his hillclimb car for more than 45 minutes as race marshalls and medics battled to free him and take him to hospital

Injury: The driver was taken to hospital but was discharged just a few hours later having suffered a broken cheek bone, cuts to his face and bruised shoulders

High speed: Spectators estimated that Mr Menzies was driving at around 125mph when he left the road

Specially-tuned cars speed up the steep course hitting speeds of up to 140mph just inches from trees and steep drops.

Recovery: Mr Menzies's wife Nicola said that her husband had left hospital on Sunday night

Yesterday Mr Menzies's wife Nicola told hillclimb racers via an online forum for that her husband had left hospital on Sunday night.

And she said the couple were now making their way back to their home in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, to prepare for Wallace’s next race in the Scottish village of Doune.

'We left the hospital in the early hours of this morning,' Mrs Menzies wrote.

'Wallace is okay apart from a broken cheek bone, facial cut and bruising to his face and shoulders.'

'Could have been a lot worse.'

She added: 'I am sure he’ll make a speedy recovery and will be ready for Doune.

'A huge thanks to the rescue crew, marshals and everyone who helped or offered help, greatly appreciated.'

A spokesman for the Midland Automobile Club, which runs the hillclimb, said: 'Following Wallace Menzies accident on Sunday we are pleased to report he was released from hospital in the early hours of the morning.

'He had four stitches, a cracked cheekbone and bruising but was in good spirits saying he felt like he had been in a rough game of rugby and asking for his money back.

'He would like to thank the marshals and medics for their swift actions and hopes to be back on the track for the next round at Doune.'
