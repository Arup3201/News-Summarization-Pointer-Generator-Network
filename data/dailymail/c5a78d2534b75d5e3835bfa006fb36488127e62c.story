Vocational skills will be taught to pupils in the colleges

Tens of thousands of 14-year-olds will leave the traditional classroom two years early and be taught to become chefs, health technicians and carers in plans for a series of technical colleges to be announced today.

The so-called ‘career colleges’ – a new network of around 40 technical colleges modelled on technical high schools in New York – will forge links with local employers who will design and help to deliver their curriculum.

In one of the biggest shake-ups of secondary schools in more than 60 years, 14 to 19-year-olds will prepare for jobs in the service sector, while also studying GCSEs in maths, English and science.

The pioneering colleges are set to offer vocational training in a range of subjects, including construction, catering and healthcare.

The plans will be published today by Lord Baker of Dorking, the former Tory Education Secretary.

The scheme is backed by Matthew Hancock, the new minister for skills, who will call for more vocational colleges to be opened.

Lord Baker said the colleges would provide youngsters with a head start in the workplace.He said: ‘With a million young people unemployed it is a disgrace that we have a skill shortage.’

The plans would build on his network of university technical colleges (UTCs) which specialise in the so-called Stem subjects – science, technology, enginering and maths.

Lord Baker said: ‘By starting at 14, youngsters have a head start in preparing for the world of work as they do in Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands, where young unemployment is much lower.

‘We have one million young people unemployed and we are issuing visas to people from overseas who have the skills that are needed – it is about time that we filled the skills gap with our own young people.’

There are already 17 UTCs operating 
in Britain, with 27 more in the pipeline and proposals for a further 15 
being assessed by the Baker Dearing Educational Trust.

The trust was set up by Lord Baker and the late Lord Dearing, a senior government adviser on education.

Cooking will be among many subjects on the curriculum at the new colleges which have link to local businesses. Posed by models

About 40 career colleges are planned over the next four years. At least 140 technical and vocational schools of different types for the 14-19 age group are now planned by 2018.

Each career college will teach between 600 and 800 students aged 14 to 19 and each will have the specialisms reflecting skills needed in its local economy.

They will follow a similar model to Lord Baker’s UTCs for 14 to 19-year-olds which specialise in engineering, design, construction and applied sciences.

Students will wear business dress and have a longer day from about 8.30am to 5pm, with two days a week spent on practical hands-on learning.

But with these colleges, the experience will be applied to different industries such as hospitality, finance, healthcare and events management.

The first college is scheduled to open in Oldham next year, and will focus on giving its students the skills to work in the digital economy.

Former Education Secretary, Lord Baker, will publish the plans today

It will partner with the University of Salford, which specialises in degrees connected to the media.A further four careers colleges are to open, including one in Purfleet, Essex, which will specialise in the creative and cultural industries.

Another in Oxford will cover ‘human health’, which includes nursing care for the elderly, residential care and social care in the community.

A college opening in Bromley, Kent, will focus on food and enterprise careers.

A college covering sports science and the management of sporting events is also in the pipeline.

The radical new breed of colleges will not just cover vocational training, but will also ensure their pupils study English, maths and science at GCSE.

At present, the division between the two in the UTCs is 40 per cent vocational and 60 per cent academic study.

The career colleges will be set up on the sites of existing further education colleges but operate as separate institutions.

They will be approved and monitored by the charity Career Colleges Trust.

Technical colleges were proposed under the 1944 Education Act and intended to sit alongside grammar schools and secondary moderns, but few local authorities set them up.
