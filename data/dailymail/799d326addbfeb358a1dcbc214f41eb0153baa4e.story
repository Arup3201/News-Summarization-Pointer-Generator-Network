Stalker: Kevin Rainbow, 28, of Deptford, south-east London, was called a 'desperate man' by a judge

A predatory stalker who relentlessly harassed his ex-girlfriend and hid under her bed was today jailed for 18 months.  

Kevin Rainbow, 28, of Deptford, south-east London, was called a ‘desperate man’ by a judge for the crimes, which saw him try to contact the woman - despite being banned from doing so.  

Rainbow stalked the 31-year-old woman, with whom he has two young children, at her office and her parents’ home, where he broke in and hid under her bed after being spotted outside.  

Sentencing him at Lewes Crown Court, Judge Shani Barnes said: ‘You are a predator who is both relentless and manipulative in your actions. You have made the life of your ex-partner a misery and have terrorised your in-laws.’  

Rainbow had lived with his former partner in the capital for five years but became increasingly controlling and abusive towards her, culminating in him hitting her on January 4 this year.  

He was charged with harassment, common assault and criminal damage - but granted bail providing he did not contact her. However, he still got in touch with her and tried to find out her workplace. 

The police were called and, while they tried to track Rainbow down, she went to Sussex to stay with her parents. On January 27 she was outside the house when she saw Rainbow in her parked car.

She ran towards the house but he chased and caught her, only for her father to come outside and pull her away from Rainbow and get her indoors. Rainbow then continued to lurk outside.  

Police were called again but by the time they arrived he could not be found. As officers were taking statements from the family they heard a noise upstairs and found Rainbow under the woman’s bed.

He was arrested and charged using a law introduced in November 2012 that makes stalking a specific offence, following an amendment to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.  

Detective Constable Stuart Macpherson of Sussex Police said: ‘This was a frightening series of events, in which Rainbow clearly showed very manipulative and abusive behaviour towards a woman who initially trusted him but eventually became terrified of him.  

‘What he would have done if we had not found him under that bed can only be guessed at.’

He added: ‘It sends another signal that we take all such reports seriously. You don't have to put up with this kind of behaviour. We will take every step we can to safeguard victims and achieve justice for them.’

Rainbow admitted stalking, harassment, criminal damage and common assault.  

Judge Barnes said: ‘I consider you to be a dangerous individual and suggest that you present a high risk of further harm, both physical and emotional, to your ex-partner.  You clearly would not accept the end of the relationship. Your actions are those of a desperate man.’ 

As well as the jail sentence, the judge also imposed a restraining order for an indefinite period on Rainbow, banning him from contacting his ex-partner or her family other than through solicitors on any access issues relating to their two children.
