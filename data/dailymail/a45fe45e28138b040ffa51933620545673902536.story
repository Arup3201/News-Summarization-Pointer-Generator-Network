Until a stranger's act of kindness turned his fortunes around forever, Alan Barnes's life had been a hard luck story.

Born disabled, he has suffered from sight and growth problems, never been able to work and his distinctive appearance attracts stares in the street.

When a mugger pushed him to the ground outside his home and broke his collar bone, the 67-year-old was determined to soldier on as he's always done.

But local beautician Katie Cutler heard about the cowardly attack and set up an online appeal to raise £500 to help the unfortunate Mr Barnes.

Alan Barnes, who was mugged as he put the bins out outside his Gateshead home, has met Katie Cutler who set up a fundraising page to help him and the appeal has raised £281,000 for the pensioner

Miss Cutler had a tearful meeting with Mr Barnes at his sister's home in North Tyneside, where he is staying 

Donations to the fund have now reached £281,000, with more than 21,000 people donating

So far the appeal has already passed £281,000 – and is still rising by the hour.

Mr Barnes, who is very frail, just over 4ft tall and weighs around six stone, has been overwhelmed by the response from well-wishers across the globe.

The donations mean he can buy a house of his own for the first time and not count the pennies to get through the week.

And yesterday, he got the chance to thank Miss Cutler, 21, in person when she visited him at his sister's home in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. 

Amid emotional scenes, Miss Cutler gave him a hug and held his hand as they chatted on the sofa. 'I am totally overwhelmed and incredibly grateful to Katie for what she has done for me,' he said.

'The youth of today don't always get portrayed in a positive light, but I won't ever forget what this young woman has done for me. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

'I always knew there were good people in the world, and this has confirmed it.'

Speaking about the 'unbelievable' fundraising response, he said money was usually only donated on that scale for charity disaster appeals.

The heart-warming appeal has been a testament to the power of the internet and social media. There have been around 20,000 public donations in just four days, and have come from as far afield as New Zealand, USA, South Africa and Canada.

Mr Barnes said he had wanted to meet Miss Cutler ever since he found out about the fundraising she started

Mr Barnes and Miss Cutler had an emotional encounter as they talked about the attack on the pensioner

Mr Barnes said the selfless act by Miss Cutler and other people who had donated had restored his faith 

Speaking this morning, the pair also revealed that local lawyers and tradesmen have offered their services for free after hearing of Mr Barnes's ordeal. 

Mr Barnes told BBC Breakfast: 'A solicitor from Gosforth has offered advice and I will just have to take it from there, but it will be put to good use.' 

And Miss Cutler added: 'A full kitchen has been offered, a conservatory, a bathroom. There's an electrician, a tiler - you name it ... everything.'

Shop manager of Tantobie store in County Durham, Addy Awam, has offered to deliver a weekly food shop to his home.

He said: 'My gesture isn't anything special but I just want to play my part and help Alan in the best way I can. 

'Anything that I sell in my shop I can get to him. I will drop it off at his house if he is unable to collect it. 

'I don't care if it's one order or five orders, I'll do this for the whole week.

Paul Sutherst, manager of Accomplished Plastering, based in Wallsend, Newcastle has also offered his services. 

He said: 'It's best for the whole city to just stick together now at a time like this and get him back to his best. 

'There are some nasty people who could do something like this to a man who can't defend himself. 

'If he needs any plastering or tiling then we'll sort it out for him. We'll do the lot for nothing, he deserves the support. Bless him.' 

Paul Stephenson, manager of Smilers Removals in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear has offered Mr Barnes his full support with moving him into his new home. 

The 40-year-old said: 'I have a removal business and I know he was looking for a new home so I thought I could offer him that. We'll get him into his new home safe and well. Anything he needs moving, packed up, and taken to his new place we've got that covered.'

The pair appeared on BBC Breakfast this morning to discuss their heart-warming encounter

Many donors have written messages of encouragement for Mr Barnes on Katie's fundraising page.

'It is just amazing, a simple thank you doesn't cover it,' he said. 'It was a total surprise and I can't believe the generosity being shown.'

Mr Barnes said he would think very carefully about how to spend the money, but promised: 'I can tell you one thing, it won't be wasted, I am always very careful with money and won't be spending it on flashy holidays, I just want to feel safe again.'

Yesterday Miss Cutler, who set up the appeal on fundraising website Go Fund Me after reading about the crime online, sobbed as she presented Mr Barnes with a get well card and chocolates. 

She said: 'I hope that he can get a house with this money. I am really overwhelmed to be here. It is lovely.

'It doesn't feel real to be honest. I knew I would get upset when I saw him, but it is happy tears. When I read that he was scared that he did not want to go back to his home, I knew I had to do something to help. I never thought it would take off in this way. I am thrilled that it has done.' 

Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes have spoken of their amazement at the reaction to the fundraising appeal

Well-wishers have started a separate fund, currently worth £580, to raise money for Miss Cutler to go on holiday - but she said she would refuse the cash because other people are more deserving.

The campaign's founder Catherine Kirkley wrote: 'We all know Katie has done a wonderful job for Alan. Let's help her have a wonderful holiday x'.

And donor Dennis Price added: 'Katie, for as long as I can remember, the news has been unrelentingly awful, with wars, unrest, social injustice and a hundred other ills and tragedies from Britain and around the world beamed into our living rooms.

'Alan Barnes suffered his misfortune as well, which disgusted everyone who heard of it, but you did something about it, despite not knowing him personally.

'Your kind and selfless act for this poor man has led to his life being transformed for the better, while seeing the generosity and warmth of all the people who have contributed to the fund you set up has made the whole country feel better.'

But in response to the fundraising, Miss Cutler replied: 'Hello everyone, this is so incredibly kind but I really can't accept anything. I have my full life to work and I can't help but feel that there are people out there who would really need it.'

There is also a Facebook campaign for the generous mother to be awarded an OBE to honour her fundraising efforts. 

Under the Go Fund Me rules, Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes can request access to the funds which have been donated at any time, and it will be paid to them within a week.

Some supporters have called for the website to waive its five per cent fee on the donations - set to add up to at least £14,000.

One donor, Richard John Darling, said: 'I couldn't live with myself if I made loads of money for myself from raising money for charity... Go Fund Me should be ashamed if they go ahead and make £20K+.'

Miss Cutler said she found the experience emotional but said her tears were 'happy tears' at their meeting

Mr Barnes has been unable to carry out his normal routine because his right arm has been in a sling

Mr Barnes has been staying with his sister and her family since the attack - including his niece Georgi Galloway and great niece Florence Purvis

Mr Barnes's disabilities were put down to his mother contracting German measles during pregnancy.

He avoided being bullied during his childhood by going to a special school for disabled children. But he has never had a job due to his disabilities and instead has done voluntary work for his local church.

A popular figure in his community, residents said he is a good mathematician and renowned for being able to quickly calculate how many days old someone is by using their date of birth.

The pensioner, who lived alone in a council house in Gateshead, was set upon by a mugger as he put his bins out at 6.30pm last Sunday.

He was knocked to the floor and left lying there after the thief demanded money and searched his pockets to find them empty, before fleeing the scene.

Mr Barnes stumbled to a neighbour's house and rang his sister who took him to hospital, and has been too scared to return to his home since.

Police have appealed for information to catch the mugger.

Detective Constable Chris Neil said: 'This was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself. His disability means he is partially sighted and quite short and it's disgraceful that someone would target him.'
