For years they have been a source of joy for youngsters playing in their gardens. But now safety experts have called for a crackdown on trampolines – because they cause too many injuries.

Officials say only one child at a time should use the devices in a bid to cut the number of people requiring hospital treatment after crashing into each other or falling awkwardly.

New figures show trampolines account for nearly 50 per cent of A&E admissions for injuries in the home among those aged under 14.

Shockingly, more youngsters are likely to end up in hospital after using one of the bouncy toys than skateboarding, rollerblading or playing football at home.

‘If you have a lot of people on the trampoline and they crash into each other you can get concussions and some nasty fractures,’ said Errol Taylor, of the Royal Society For The Prevention Of Accidents (RoSPA), which compiled the statistics. ‘We also know if you have a safety net, parents tend to get complacent about safety and that’s when you get more horseplay and serious incidents.’

RoSPA compiled detailed records from A&E departments in Oxfordshire over 15 months to get a snapshot of how people suffer injuries.

Two-thirds of the 64,000 patients treated were hurt in the home. Of sports injuries at home, 54.9 per cent of girls and 38 per cent of boys were injured by playing on a trampoline.

Mr Taylor warned that children suffered the worst injuries while bouncing on the trampoline at the same time as an adult, adding: ‘When the adult has bounced and the trampoline is going back up and rising as the little one is coming down it’s as if they’ve just jumped out of a first floor window.’

Sales of trampolines – which often cost less than £100 – have soared to more than one million in the UK in recent years.

Doctors in America have called for them to be banned due to the number of casualties there.

However, RoSPA does not want to see that happen in the UK and is instead working with manufacturers on new safety measures. 

‘We want people to continue to have fun but in as safe a way as possible,’ said Mr Taylor. ‘One of the things we are exploring is if we could have a target in the sweet spot of the trampoline which makes it clear you can only really have one person on it. As soon as you have two people you are going to get children crashing into each other or one being thrown off.’
