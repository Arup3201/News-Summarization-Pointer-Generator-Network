Disgust: Hundreds of users logged onto Facebook yesterday to find the disturbing footage appear on their personal news feed

Facebook has sparked fury after a graphic child abuse video went viral on the social network, reportedly being 'shared' over 16,000 times.

Thousands of users logged onto their accounts last night to find the horrifying footage appear on their personal news feed and instantly took to Twitter to vent their disgust.

According to users who saw the clip, apparently of a young girl being abused by a grown man, it had already been shared over 16,000 times and received almost 4,000 'likes'.

Even more disturbingly, users then began 
uploading and sharing screen grabs of the video on Twitter in an 
apparent bid to alert fellow Twitterati of the horrifying content.

Many more voiced their outrage on rival website Twitter at how the video could be shared on Facebook despite the site’s extensive reporting tools.

Facebook!! nearly 4k likes and over 16k shares in under 7 hours... this 
world is sick.'

Maddison Twatter wrote: 'There is child porn on my Facebook timeline... I'm so f******* angry.'

Another user called Nicholas added: 
'Someone posted child porn on Facebook and its spreading like wildfire. 
Why the **** would someone do that to a child.'

A Facebook spokesperson said: 
'Nothing is more important to Facebook than the safety of the people 
that use our site, and this material has no place on Facebook.

'We have zero tolerance for child 
pornography being uploaded onto Facebook and are extremely aggressive in
 preventing and removing child exploitative content.

'We are pleased that this material was reported to us quickly enabling its swift removal.'

Disturbing: Thousands of users woke up yesterday to find the disturbing footage appear on their personal Facebook news feed and instantly took to Twitter to vent their disgust

Shock: Even more disturbingly, users then began uploading and sharing screen grabs of the video on Twitter in an apparent bid to alert fellow Twitterati of the horrifying content

Sick: The disturbing footage apparently showed a young girl being abused by a grown man

But this disturbing underbelly of the 
popular social networking website is not a new revelation to the 
company, which until 2011 relied heavily on reports from its users 
about illegal activity.

Last year an exposé published by WND.com revealed a disturbing amount of child pornography being shared by predators on the social network.

Graphic photos of children, including infants and toddlers, were uncovered by the site, some  taken from entire albums of children forced into acts 
by paedophiles.

Firewall: Last May, Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) incorporated Microsoft's PhotoDNA program designed to cull through images and data quickly in a bid to police the website and rid it of abuse

Others too graphic to publish included photographs 
of children forced to have sex with each 
other, being raped by adults, and forced to expose their genitals to the
camera.

Anger: The video had apparently been shared over 16,000 times by by 2am GMT today

Facebook said at the time the program
was used to search for several thousand illegal images among the 
200million uploaded each day, focusing on children under 12 as part of 
an initiative to battle 'the worst of the worst'.

The program is able to search for 
some of the thousands of photographs collected by the National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which helps to identify and help victims
and cooperates with authorities on investigations into their origins.
