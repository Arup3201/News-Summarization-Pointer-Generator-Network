Police have released an image of a distinctive tattoo in an effort to identity a man whose dismembered body was found partially encased in cement inside a garage behind a Detroit home.

The cut-up corpse was found May 30 by a neighbor who noticed an overwhelming foul odor and called police. An officer discovered some of the parts, which were believed to be from one entire body, after opening one of several plastic containers inside the garage.

Mystery: Detroit police have released this image of the tattoo in an attempt to identify the victim, who body parts were found encased in cement

Neighbor Terrence Hayes, who smelled the body parts, told WJBK of his experience on May 30.

'Smelled like a dead rat – a smell you don’t want to smell, like something dead. Real dead,' he said. 'I just saw the foot and then that’s it.'

Police said in a statement Monday that the victim had a tattoo on his forearm reading, 'R.I.P. Deisha,' with '8/23/81-4/7/09' underneath.

Mary Mazur, Director of Communications
 for the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office, told MailOnline in a 
phone interview that a forensic anthropologist was able to pull a soft 
tissue sample from the victim and recover the body parts from the 
cement.

'One crate 
contained the head and the torso, which was completely intact,' she 
said. 'The other crate contained the arms, legs, feet and hands.'

Mazur said a previous fingerprint test run against data from both local and state police was unsuccessful because of decomposition.

Mazur said the findings suggested 'some level of dismemberment,' and that the cause of death has not yet been determined.

The victim, Mazur told MailOnline, was either a white or light-skinned black male.

'Hopefully we'll be able to solve this mystery,' she said.

Mazur anyone with information to come forward and contact the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office at 313-833-2504.

Police have said a man who may have been living or squatting inside the home has been arrested on an unrelated charge since the discovery.
