Schools of bait fish may have enticed a shark involved in a fatal attack in northern NSW closer to shore and there are concerns it could happen again in the lead up to summer.

A man, believed to be in his 50s, was bitten on his right leg by a shark around 15-20 metres offshore at Byron Bay on Tuesday morning.

Michael Brown, a shark expert who runs Surf Watch Australia, believes the attack was a result of recent stormy weather and an increased number of bait fish in the area.

'A lot of these big schools of fish are coming in close to shore and the rough weather we’ve had is dredging up the bottom. One thing leads to another… and as the bait fish come in, the sharks are following,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia.

'When you have swimmers in the area where sharks are coming in to feed on the bait fish… that's where the problem lies.

'I think that’s the underlying issue that’s caused today’s (incident).'

Mr Brown said Byron Bay was 'absolutely a hot spot' for shark sightings due to the high number of fish close to shore.

'I wouldn’t say Byron is the worst spot in NSW but it’s up there. The water is nice and clear and there's a lot of fish,' he said.

He warned the amount of bait fish moving up and down the east coast could see an increased number of sharks closure to shore in the coming months.

'At the moment there’s a lot of bait fish in the area and that leads to a lot of sharks. With rough conditions and the way things are going at the moment, there’s definitely grounds for concern. If this carries on into summer, we could definitely have a problem,' Mr Brown said.

'Best thing we could do is forget about shark culling and invest time and money in establishing a program to monitor where bait fish are and pre-empt where sharks are going to be.

'If you look back at every serious shark attack over the past 20 years, they’re all coming in to feed.'

The man's death on Tuesday is the latest in a string of fatal shark attacks that have plagued Australian waters.

Christine Armstrong, 63, was swimming with a group of five others including her husband when she was taken by a shark at Tathra off the south coast of NSW in April

Five other fatal attacks have occurred in the past two years, including a 63-year-old woman who was taken by a shark while swimming off the south coast of NSW in April.

Christine Armstrong was swimming with a group of five others, one of which was her husband, when she was attacked at Tathra.

Mrs Armstrong and her husband Rob regularly swam in the area but on the day she was attacked she had turned back a little earlier due to spinal pain.

A widespread search was launched and Mrs Armstrong's cap and goggles were later located.

A 19-year-old man had to be pulled from the water by three friends after he was attacked by a shark while bodyboarding near Coffs Harbour on the NSW north coast in November last year.

Zac Young had been sitting astride his bodyboard when an eight-foot tiger shark came up behind him on November 29.

It's believed both of Mr Young's legs were nearly severed in the attack.

His friends tried to perform CPR when he was pulled from the water, but the teenager later died of cardiac arrest.

Just a few days earlier on November 23, Chris Boyd, 35, was attacked by a great white shark off Gracetown in Western Australia.

The father of two was killed instantly when he was mauled by the shark while surfing at popular break Umbies, 270km south of Perth.

Witnesses said Mr Boyd was dragged to shore on another man's surfboard and he was missing his left arm and part of his right leg.

The attack on Mr Boyd prompted the WA Government's controversial catch-and-kill shark program, which was trialled earlier this year.

The body of 24-year-old Ben Linden was never found after he was taken by a great white near Wedge Island in Western Australia on July 14, 2012

Ben Linden, 24, was killed near Wedge Island in Western Australia on July 14, 2012, after being taken by what was believed to be a great white shark.

He had been at the surf spot, 180km north of Perth, for about an hour before the great white attacked and swam away with his body.

Mr Linden's body was never found.

A witness who was riding a jetski near where Mr Linden was attacked told a coronial inquest into his death that he tried to scare away the shark with his jetski.

'There was just blood everywhere and a massive, massive white shark circling the body,' Matthew Holmes said, according to the ABC.

'I reached to grab the body and the shark came at me on the jet-ski and tried to knock me off and I did another loop and when I came back to the body the shark took it.'

Father-of-two Peter Kurmann was taken while he was diving in Western Australia back in March 2012.

The 33-year-old's brother had to drag his body to a nearby boat after he was attacked at the Port Geographe Marina in Busselton, south of Perth.
