Tragedy: The bereft family of talented sportswoman Caitlin McCart, 17, have paid tribute to her today after she died in her sleep

A devastated family have paid tribute to their 'special angel' schoolgirl after she died suddenly in her sleep.

Hockey coach Caitlin McCart, 17, was found dead in her bedroom by her heartbroken mother Kathleen, 47.

Miss McCart, of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, was a star player for Uddingston Ladies Hockey team and regularly led children's training at the popular club.

The fit and healthy teenager had gone to bed as normal with no signs of ill health but woke in the early hours of October 23 feeling unwell.

Mrs McCart let her sleep longer in the morning but the mother-of-two was left griefstricken after discovering Caitlin was not breathing when she later went to wake her.

Caitlin's cause of death is still unknown but the family are awaiting results from further tests.

Speaking last night Mrs McCart and her husband James, 54, paid tribute to their 'special angel'.

Mrs McCart said: 'I'm still in complete shock. We all are.

'Caitlin was a normal, healthy teenager who was really into sports.

'She went to bed as normal but then was unwell.

'So I stayed in her room with her all night and then in the morning I let her sleep longer.

'I went back in to wake her and couldn't. Everything is a blur, I'm just numb.'

Mrs McCart told how she and Caitlin had been enjoying planning her future.

She added: 'Caitlin was really the most lovely and genuine person. She was my best friend as well as my daughter.

'The evening before we had spent about two hours writing up an application form for a job in a shop.

'She had just started driving lessons and had booked a holiday to Zante with friends.

'Caitlin had everything to live for and her whole life ahead. I just feel robbed, Caitlin was robbed.

'All she wanted to do with her life was help people and now that's been taken away from us and the people she may have helped.

'Now it's hard to even begin to get my head around that she's gone. As a family we are just taking it hour by hour.'

Devastated: Miss McCart, 17, was found dead in her bedroom by her heartbroken mother Kathleen, 47, who said 'she was my best friend as well as my daughter'

Mr McCart added: 'This is just like living your worst nightmare.

'It's like waking up in a bad dream, and it never ending.

'It's the first thing you think about in the morning and the last thing at night and all the time in between.'

More than 800 friends and family attended Caitlin's funeral at St Joseph's RC Church in Blantyre on October 31.

A service was later held at Holytown Crematorium where her family and friends released more than 200 balloons in her honour.

Caitlin's older sister Kirsty, 29, said: 'Caitlin was my better half.

'I always felt complete knowing she was by my side.

'I love her with all my heart and cherished every moment I had with her.'

John McKay, headteacher of Uddingston Grammar where Caitlin had been a popular sixth year pupil and sports ambassador, paid tribute to the youngster

He said: 'Caitlin was a wonderful example of a modern young woman, vibrant, independent, enthusiastic and selfless.

'Caitlin's star shone brightly and illuminated us all. We feel our loss intently however she shines on in our hearts.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.'Â
