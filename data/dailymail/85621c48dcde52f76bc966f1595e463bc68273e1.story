Asylum seekers are being allowed into Britain without background searches to check if they are murderers, rapists or child abusers.

Ministers admit that criminal records are not examined when someone applies to live in Britain in case it causes problems for them in their home country.

The gaping loophole in immigration policy was last night described as ‘nonsense on stilts’.

Checks on asylum seekers do not include criminal convictions in case it causes problems for them in their home country

Last month it emerged border inspectors unearthed one case in which staff accepted an application from an asylum-seeker – unaware that he had admitted a fatal stabbing in his homeland.

Home Office minister Lord Bates told peers in a debate that it was the 'intention' to carry out checks on the background of asylum applicants.

But in a letter sent a month later, he admitted that while names are checked against UK and EU police databases, information is not sought from the country individuals are fleeing from.

During the debate Labour peer Lord Martin, the former Commons Speaker, raised concerns about the ease with which individuals became asylum seekers.

He said: 'My Lords, when I served as a Member of Parliament, I had a large proportion of asylum seekers in my constituency of Glasgow Springburn.

'What would happen was that the asylum seeker would say, 'I seek asylum' and therefore they were looked at.

'Can I get the assurance that when asylum seekers are seeking asylum, they are checked to see whether they have been serious offenders in their previous country?'

Lord Bates replied: 'That is certainly the intention and the process.' He added that he would check on the details.

In a letter to peers he admitted: 'Upon claiming asylum, the Home Office conducts a series of checks against databases including our immigration fingerpint database, Eurodac (a European wide database) and the Police National Computer (PNC) in order to identify any known criminal or security issues.

'We do not currently check overseas criminal records in asylum cases because, in some instances, by disclosing an application has been made could put an applicant at risk or jeopardise the liberty and security of family members still living in the country of origin, potentially strengthening their claim for asylum.'

The loophole means someone convicted or wanted for a serious offence outside Europe would not be picked up, and could be granted the right to stay in the UK.

The admission has sparked calls for an urgent review of the policy. It comes after the outcry last year when 14-year-old Alice Gross was murdered by Latvian Arnis Zalkalns, who had served seven years for murdering his wife.

Labour MP Frank Field told The Sunday Times the policy of not looking at the criminal past of asylum seekers was 'shocking' and 'nonsense on stilts'.

He added: 'People have been murdered by asylum seekers.

'A slightly late new year's resolution for the home secretary should be to ensure everyone seeking asylum has their criminal record checked.'
