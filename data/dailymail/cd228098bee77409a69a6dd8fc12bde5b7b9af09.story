Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has promised fallen media baron Conrad Black that he will take a drug test to prove he's sober in an exclusive interview that airs this evening.

The disgraced Canadian journalist
taped an interview with Ford last Friday and it was originally planned 
to air on December 16, but pushed forward a full week 'due to demand'.

In the revealing interview he explains how he hasn't touched a drop of alcohol for the last five weeks.

Tete-a-tete: Conrad Black's interview with Ford will air tonight in Canada on ZoomerTV at midnight Eastern Time, 9pm Pacific

In a preview of the interview, Ford announces that he hasn't had a drink since last month.

'I
 haven't had a drop of alcohol in five weeks,' he says. 'I was never an 
alcoholic. But you know, I'd like to have a few drinks on the weekends, 
like I think a lot of people do.

'But a couple of times I made a fool of myself, if you want to be frank.'

Ford
 says events like being caught drunk at the Taste of Danforth event in 
downtown Toronto last August made him reevaluate drinking, and he came 
to the conclusion that 'enough's enough'.

Black
 will likely be an understanding interviewer, as he spent 37 months in a
 U.S. prison after being convicted of obstruction of justice.

Relentless: Mayor Ford has refused to step down from office since Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair announced in October that they have a video showing him smoking out of a crack pipe. Chief Blair was at the funeral today

In the preview, Black said that the 'piling on' to Mayor Ford 'has been excessive'.

'He was elected mayor of Toronto and those who do not like his style will be free to vote against him is he runs again,' Black said.

'If there is sufficient evidence to prosecute him with crimes, due process should be followed.

'But he should be accorded a full presumption of innocence unless he is justly convicted. Beyond that his accusers should put up or shut up.'

Mayor Ford first made headlines in October when Toronto police chief Bill Blair announced they had a video which showed Ford smoking from a crack pipe.

Initially, Ford denied that he had ever smoked crack and refused to resign.

Changing his story: Mayor Ford initially denied ever smoking crack, but eventually confessed saying he wasn't addicted to the substance

But on November 5, Ford admitted that he had smoked crack-cocaine in the past, maintaining that he is not addicted to the substance.

'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine but...am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Um, probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.'

Since then, Ford's been a constant headline fixture as his public behavior spiraled out of control and the Toronto city council voted to remove his special privileges and reduce his office budget.

But perhaps Ford's most embarrassing gaffe was when he described allegations that he made passes at a staffer, Olivia Gondek.

New addiction: Mayor Ford has been exercising regularly and promised to lose 40 to 50 pounds in the next six months

'It says that I wanted to eat her p****. I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much,' he said in a press conference on November 14.

Ford was forced to hold another press conference later in the day in order to apologize for his lewd language earlier.

Reneta stood behind him as he apologized for his 'graphic language' blaming the 'impulse in my remarks' on the last six months of 'tremendous stress'. 

Today Ford he was joined by his wife Reneta today as the two attended a funeral for fallen Police Constable John Zivcic.

Constable
 Zivcic, 34, was on duty when he was involved in a car crash on November
 30 and died two days later in the hospital. Ontario Premier Kathleen 
Wynne and Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair spoke at the funeral. Mayor 
Ford did not make a speech.

The rare appearance of Reneta Ford happened the same day the interview is set to air.

Rob Ford's wife Renata Brejniak stood by her man today as he apologized for the 'graphic language' he used to describe allegations he made sexual advances towards a staffer.

Not much is known about Renata, even to people within the Ford circle. She has been described as the 'invisible wife' and an 'enigma' by Toronto Life Magazine.

The couple met in high school when they were only living a few blocks from each other, and got married in 2000. They have an 8-year old daughter, Stephanie, and a 5-year-old son, Douglas.

Doug Holyday, Ford's former deputy mayor was at their wedding held at St George's Golf and Country Club.

'I don't even know if she has a job,' he told Toronto Life.

The Ford marriage has been far from perfect. In 2008, a domestic dispute started between the two when Ford called the police because of his wife's 'irrational, out-of-control' behavior.

When police 'saw the situation' they informed him to leave with the children so he took them to his mother's house.

Television crews covering the dispute showed up to Ford's parents house where he used daughter Stephanie to deflect questions about the fight. He held her up in the front door and she said 'no comment' to the reporters gathered outside. 

The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police.

Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her.

At the time, a neighbor described Mrs Ford to the Globe and Mail as 'reclusive and rarely seen out of the house'

The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part.

The couple seemed to patch things up after the incident.

'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife. My wife supports me.'

Renata rarely gives interviews. A June 2013 Toronto Sun article about the first-lady of Toronto references the last time she spoke to the press - October 25, 2010 when Ford was elected mayor.

Renata was helping her husband out at the time, returning calls when one reporter got a rare opportunity to chat with the first lady of Toronto. When asked about their children, Renata says they try to shelter Stephanie and Doug from politics.

'We have decided to wait until they are older to explain about politics,' she said. 

'The revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts and prostitution have pushed me over the line,' he said. 'I used unforgivable language.'

Ford has been married to his wife Renata Brejniak since 2000. They met in high school and have two children together, daughter Stephanie and son Doug.

Reneta rarely gives interviews with the press, and usually isn't seen out with her husband except for important political occasions - like when he was elected mayor in 2010.

The Ford interview on Conversation with Conrad will air at midnight Eastern Time, 9pm Pacific tonight on ZoomerTV in Canada.
