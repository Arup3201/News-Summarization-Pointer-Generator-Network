World record holder Victoria Arlen can swim again after she was originally ruled
‘ineligible’ for the London Paralympics after as her impairment was not deemed 
severe enough to qualify.

Arlen, 17, appealed the decision by the International Paralympic Committee's on Monday - and won, as officials said she would
be allowed to compete in the same ‘S6’ swimming event.

Now, she will be in the pool on Saturday in a much-anticipated race pitting her against British swimmer Ellie Simmonds.

Arlen was paralysed in 2006 by a virus which affected her spinal cord and left her in a vegetative state for two years.

Simmonds became as the darling of the pool at Beijing in 2008, when she won golds in the 100m and 400m freestyle at the age of just 13.

Now 17, Simmonds, who has dwarfism, is hoping to defend those titles against Arlen, who broke both of her world records at the U.S. trials in June.

On Saturday she will face Simmonds in the heats of the 400m freestyle, with a final decision as to her classification being made after this contest.

Champion: Ellie Simmonds, Britain's youngest ever gold medallist, in action in the pool. She is hoping to defend the two medals she won in Beijing in 2008, when she was just 13

Before the Games, Simmonds named Arlen as her greatest rival, telling the BBC: ‘It’s given me a bit of a buzz really, a bit of determination.

‘I’m a very competitive person and being behind the blocks, knowing that she is the world record holder and that I have to beat her, is really exciting.’

Simmonds is competing for four medals,  in the 50m, 100m and 400m freestyle and the 200m individual medley.

And the pressure is on – following her double gold in Beijing, she was named the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, and became the youngest person ever to be awarded the MBE.

Speaking about this year’s Games, she said: ‘Four years ago it was all new for me.

'Now I know coming into the Games what a Paralympics is like, how big an event it is.

'It’s definitely going to be a big event being at a home Games.

'It’s exciting, but it’s quite scary.’
