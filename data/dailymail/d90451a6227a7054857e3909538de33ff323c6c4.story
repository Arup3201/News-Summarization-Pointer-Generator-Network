Alex Lynn will finally get the Formula One opportunity he has long craved - but not with the team he might have expected.

Lynn was crowned GP3 champion over the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix weekend, becoming part of a glorious triumvirate for British motorsport this season as Jolyon Palmer took the GP2 title, while Lewis Hamilton was crowned F1 king for the second time.

The 21-year-old from Essex is now in the running for the vacant seat at Toro Rosso given he is a member of the Red Bull junior programme.

Surprisingly, Lynn was not offered a drive by either Red Bull or Toro Rosso for the two-day post-season test that began on Tuesday at the Yas Marina circuit.

However, Lynn has been given an opportunity by Lotus and will take to the track in an F1 car for the first time on Wednesday.

'I can't wait to get behind the wheel of a Formula One car,' said Lynn.

'It's obviously what I've been working towards throughout my career to date, and I'm very grateful for the chance.

They completed a clean sweep with Lewis Hamilton, who claimed his second F1 championship

'It just goes to show that winning the GP3 Series opens a few doors.

'I'm really excited by this opportunity, but of course I'm very realistic about it too. I'm just going to go out there and do my best.

'Hopefully I'll be able to increase my experience and pass on some useful feedback to the engineers.

'I don't think there are any particular expectations from anybody. I just want to do a solid job and learn as much as I can about Formula One.'
