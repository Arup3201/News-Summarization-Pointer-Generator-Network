Almost £1billion was wiped off Lloyds’ market value yesterday after the boss of the state-backed banking group went on immediate sick leave.

Shares plummeted after António Horta-Osório began an enforced break barely eight months after taking on one of the biggest jobs in British finance.

The Portuguese-born banker, who became chief executive in March with a package worth around £8.3million, has been diagnosed with extreme fatigue and stress due to overwork.

Fatigue: António Horta-Osório, pictured with wife Ana at a charity event, was put on sick leave just six months after becoming chief executive of Lloyds with a package worth £8.3m

Doctors ordered the 47-year-old father of three – who was also promised a ‘golden hello’ worth up to £4million in shares – to rest for six to eight weeks because he is physically and mentally exhausted. City sources say he is unlikely to return to his post.

The unexpected announcement caused turmoil in the part- nationalised bank and sent Lloyds shares sliding. By the close of trading last night they had dropped by 4.4 per cent, ending the day 1.36p down at 29.2p.

That was the biggest percentage fall in the FTSE 100 and wiped £930million off the value of Lloyds Banking Group. It left the taxpayer, which owns 40 per cent of the bank, £372million worse off.

After an emergency board meeting, Lloyds group finance director Tim Tookey was appointed ‘interim’ chief executive. But he has already announced his resignation and leaves early next year.

Mr Horta-Osório – distinguished by his slicked-back hair and designer stubble – has lured many former colleagues from Santander, his former employer, to Lloyds.

Exhausting work: The banking chief was in the process of implementing his vision for Lloyds, which included the layoff of around 15,000

Mr Tookey was one of the last of the 
old guard remaining from the regime of ex-chief executive Eric Daniels, 
who was behind the disastrous takeover of HBOS and until recently was 
still being paid almost £100,000 a month by Lloyds for doing nothing.

Mr
Horta-Osório’s ‘leave of absence’ means Lloyds is left with no boss and
a new management team to confront a deepening economic crisis.

His
illness comes at a bad time as he was implementing his strategic vision
for the bank, which included overseeing an EU-imposed sale of 632 
branches, a revamp of its Halifax brand and around 15,000 job losses.

Lloyds is due to announce its third-quarter results next week which, given the state of the economy, are unlikely to be good.

In
a recent interview, Mr Horta-Osório, whose hobbies include swimming 
with sharks and scuba diving, described ‘working 24/7’ in his efforts to
turn around Lloyds.

First 
signs that all was not well with the banker – hailed at home as 
Portugal’s third-greatest export behind footballing stars Jose Mourinho 
and Cristiano Ronaldo – followed his non-appearance at a parliamentary 
committee meeting on Tuesday.

The
bank issued a statement yesterday saying: ‘The board of Lloyds Banking 
Group announces that following medical advice António Horta-Osório is 
taking a temporary leave of absence from his duties as group chief 
executive due to illness.’

The bank added: ‘Antonio is expected to return to his position before the end of the year.’

But
last night doubts remained about whether he will return to one of the 
toughest jobs in British banking, second only to Stephen Hester’s task 
as boss of state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland. One banking source said:
‘There’s no way he can come back.’

Financial fatigue: Lloyds CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio has been signed off sick due to 'overwork'

The stress-related absence of António Horta-Osório from Lloyds is the latest in a succession of shocks that have undermined the strength and reputation of what was once considered Britain’s best-run bank.

It leaves Lloyds rudderless at a time of ferocious storms in the financial world, with the flood waters from the euroland crisis already spilling over on to this nation’s shores.

What is even more shocking is that Mr Horta-Osório was seen as the great hope for retail banking in Britain. In conversations we had over recent months he pledged to bring a laser-like focus to improving customer service and ensuring that small businesses would be treated with the care and respect they deserved.

His leave from the boardroom – officially a short break but already being interpreted as a permanent departure – means those ambitions have been thwarted for the time being.

His temporary successor, finance boss Tim Tookey, will need to concentrate on steadying the ship and controlling the panic in the shares rather than overhauling and improving the business model.

The troubles at Lloyds are a parable of mishandling by government. Lloyds is Tesco-like in its dominance of high street banking, with a 30 per cent share of retail operations as a result of the calamitous merger with Halifax Bank of Scotland in the wake of the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

The then Prime Minister Gordon Brown nodded the deal through without reference to the Competition Commission, which polices bids that threaten customer choice.

Until that point Lloyds, run by the cautious American Eric Daniels, had taken a totally different path to that of its rivals on the high street.

Final straw: The financial crisis in Europe sent Lloyds' shares tumbling

Instead of rushing into investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages and dodgy property lending, it had concentrated on serving the domestic consumer and business market.

The conservatism of Lloyds made it a very popular share with private investors (including this writer) and its stock was famous for offering a dividend interest rate yield far better than anything that could be obtained in the savings accounts offered by  its branches.

The HBOS takeover changed the group. It provided Lloyds with a dominant role on the high street through Halifax and its offshoots but it also brought with it Bank of Scotland, which had become a favourite lender to every business spiv that knocked on its door.

'The big question now is whether the star banker will ever be robust enough for the challenges ahead'

The enormous mistakes made by HBOS meant that when the banks were required to strengthen their balance sheets in October 2008 the enlarged Lloyds accepted £20billion of cash from the Government, which grabbed a 40 per cent share of the enlarged bank in exchange.

When he arrived, the new Portuguese chief executive had a huge legacy of problems to deal with.

What he found most difficult, however, was running a publicly quoted company in the full glare of the media. In his previous job, as the boss of the British subsidiary of the Santander bank, he was not exposed to the same pressures.

By all accounts he found the constant juggling of different interest groups very trying.

He needed to deal with the Government, the Bank of England, UKFI (the holder of the Government’s 40pc stake), the City shareholders and a vast workforce.

And behind the steely façade and handsome head of slicked back hair Mr Horta-Osório was struggling.

The final straw was the financial crisis in Europe, which sent Lloyds’ shares tumbling. The quick exit from the heavy hand of government ownership has looked impossible as the shares have tanked.

The big question for Lloyds chairman Sir Win Bischoff now is whether his chosen star banker will ever be robust enough for the tremendous challenges ahead.
