Inquest: Jean Blakey, 55, who was shot dead by her son Ian had 'never complained about her illness' and was always smiling, an inquest had heard

A mother shot dead by her son who believed she could not cope with Multiple Sclerosis had ‘never complained about her illness’ and was desperate to live, an inquest heard.

Ian Blakey told his mother Jean, 55, he wanted to take her shopping but instead drove to a secluded woodland to kill her and then himself because he 'didn't fancy doing life' in prison for her murder.

The 34-year-old, who had taken cocaine and an ecstasy-type drug, rang 999 and told the operator: 'I have killed my mother. She has got MS and I’m sick of the f***** sight of it.'

He then killed his pet lurcher and then sat in the car next to her mother's body,  and shot himself dead near Crook Golf Club in County Durham on April 28 this year.

In a note left with his ex-partner on the morning of their deaths, Ian, 34,  said he could not watch his mother live with Multiple Sclerosis, a debilitating disease which left her in a wheelchair.

However a double inquest conducted by Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle yesterday found that Jean had no wish to die and her partner said she woke up every day with a smile on her face.

Ian had called his mother the night before to say he wanted to take her out shopping in nearby Bishop Auckland before going to a pub for lunch.

He arrived at the house she shared with her partner of 26-years Harry Mawson and drove her away in Mr Mawson’s Peugeot van, which was modified for her wheelchair.

Mr Mawson told the inquest: 'I even showed him how to strap her in and how to take her out. He took her out at five past 11. Twenty minutes later, he did what he did.'

Jean’s partner said it was unusual for her to be taken out by her son as the last time he had taken her out was for her 50th birthday - but Jean was looking forward to the trip.

Mr Mawson told the coroner that Jean had no wish to die, adding: 'She was not bad as he (Ian) made out.

'She was a happy woman who woke up every morning with a smile on her face.

'She never once complained about her illness. She always greeted her carers with a smile and enjoyed outings with them.'

After taking his mother out, Ian , who lived a few streets away from his mother , called the police at 11.25am.

A transcript of the 999 call was read out at their inquest held in Crook in which Mr Blakey gave the operator his name and told her he was at Crook Golf Course and said: “I have killed my mother.

'She has got MS and I’m sick of the f***ing sight of it.'

Officers found Jean, her son and one of Blakey’s lurchers shot dead in the vehicle.

Detective Constable Stephen Hedley told the inquest Jean was found dead in her wheelchair in the back of the van, Ian was in the driver’s seat and the dog in  the passenger foot well.

Officers also found an unregistered Beretta up and over double barrel shot gun.

Before he went to collect his mother, he posted a letter through the door of his ex-partner Samantha Peacock.

Extracts were read at the inquest in which Blakey wrote it had 'been on the cards for years' as he was 'mentally unhinged' but never told anyone.

Medical records show in 2008 he saw a psychiatrist and complained of feeling depressed, suicidal and hearing voices in his head, but never attended future appointments.

The letter added that he could not stand to see his mother 'like that' but he did not 'fancy doing life'.

DC Hedley said Ian had previously expressed concern about his mother’s health to Ms Peacock and told a friend:

'You would not keep a lurcher like that.

'If you kept a dog like that you would get done off the RSCPA.'

The letter ended with Mr Blakey saying: 'Tell everyone I am sorry, if anyone wants my dogs they are welcome to them.'

DC Hedley said another note, which looked like a practice effort for the one sent to Ms Peacock, was found in Ian’s work van.

Jean’s partner, Mr Mawson told how Blakey, 34, would visit his mother ‘once or twice a week’ but would only stay for a short time and had no involvement in  her care.

County Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle heard that Jean relied on a wheelchair but never stopped enjoying life.

DC Hedley said: 'Although the physical effects of her illness were quite marked, she was coping well, was upbeat and approached her illness with good humour.'

A post-mortem examination by forensic pathologist Dr Nigel Cooper found trace amounts of cocaine and an ecstasy-like drug in Mr Blakey’s system, as well as prescribed medication he was taking for epilepsy.

Dr Cooper, said: 'He may well have been experiencing the effects associated with those drugs prior to his death.'

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing on Jean and ruling that Blakey took his own life, Mr Tweddle said: 'There could be no objective justification whatsoever for what was done that day.'
