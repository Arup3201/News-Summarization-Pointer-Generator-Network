A koala causing havoc on a Sydney road has been 'arrested' and placed in a paddy wagon by police.

Officers from the New South Wales Police Dog Unit posted the adorable photos of the tiny criminal on their Facebook page.

The koala was spotted running in and out of traffic in Campbelltown, in south-west Sydney, at about 2am on Sunday morning by Senior Constable Barry.

'SC Barry stopped and spoke to the Koala about the dangers of running across the lanes of traffic,' the Facebook post read.

'SC Barry had to issue a move along direction to the Koala for hindering traffic!

'After failing to comply and 'move along' numerous warnings were issued and the Koala failed to comply and [Campbelltown police] attended and a short foot pursuit occurred and the Koala was eventually arrested and placed for safety in a police vehicle.'

In the photos posted on the social networking site the furry marsupial can be seen in the back of the paddy wagon next to a pair of handcuffs. 

Inspector Adam Johnson, commander of the NSW Dog Unit, said one of his officers was out patrolling with his two dogs when he spotted the koala on the road.

'If he hadn't have jumped out and grabbed it the koala probably would have been run over,' Mr Johnson said.

'He called for one of the local units to come down and they put the koala in the back cage just while they contacted the RSPCA to check what to do.

'They've just taken those photos with the handcuffs as a bit of humour - a lot of policing's always serious so it's good to have a light-hearted moment.' 

The RSPCA advised the police to release the koala in a 'suitable location' away from the Campbelltown traffic.

'The Koala was last seen decamping from the Police Vehicle leaving the handcuffs behind,' the Facebook post read.

The pictures have received more than 2000 likes and hundreds of comments.

'I love it when the stories are good ones it's a nice break for you guys. Naughty koala I hope he didn't resist arrest,' Finoa Termytelen wrote.

'That is so cute glad they helped him out,' Lisa Owens wrote.

Meanwhile, Simone Ussher wrote: 'He must of had a hard night on the eucalyptus.'
