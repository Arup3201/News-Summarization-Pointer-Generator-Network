The British people are weary of becoming involved in another lengthy conflict overseas 
after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 
Defence Secretary said today.

In what 
will be considered a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor over any 
possible military deployment to Syria, Phillip Hammond said Afghanistan 
had become Britain’s Vietnam.

The Defence Secretary's remarks came 
while on a visit to the main British base at Camp Bastion in the Helmand
province of Afghanistan.

His remarks also come amid heightened tensions over the
Middle East between the West and Russia, as the US prepares to arm rebel fighters after it 
confirmed the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons on its own people.

Mr Cameron has resisted greater 
involvement in the Syrian conflict for the last two years partly over 
fears of comparison with ex-PM Tony Blair, who took Britain into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq two years later

The Prime Minister will use the G8 
Summit in Northern Ireland to talk to US President Barrack 
Obama about how best to arm rebels in the country who have been trying 
to topple the regime of Bashar al Assad for the past two years.

Cuts row: Phillip Hammond has warned further cuts to the Ministry of Defence's budget will hurt Britain's operation effectiveness

He has already held preliminary 
discussions by video conference with Mr Obama, the French President 
Francois Hollande , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime 
Minister Enrico Letta, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed this 
morning.

‘Three days before a working dinner on 
foreign policy, they discussed the situation in Syria and how G8 
countries should all agree to work on together a political transition to
end the conflict,’ Downing Street said.

Britain has been engaged in almost continuous conflict in the Middle Eat since the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001.

Since then, 444 British Service personnel have died in the Afghanistan and thousands more have been seriously injured.

'I suspect that the British people - and
not just the British people - will be wary of enduring engagements on 
this kind of scale for perhaps quite a long while in the future,' Mr 
Hammond said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph.

'You might call it the Vietnam 
phenomenon - when an engagement turns out to be longer and more costly 
than originally envisaged, there is often a public reaction to that.'

Mr Hammond added the true lesson from 
Afghanistan may be that a prolonged military commitment could have been 
avoided if the West had been prepared to intervene earlier before al 
Qaida launched its attack on the Twin Towers.

'We ourselves have learned the lesson 
that earlier, smaller scale intervention may often avoid the need for 
more massive intervention later, and if we are in a mood for beating 
ourselves up, perhaps we should have foreseen the consequences of what 
was happening in Afghanistan before 9/11,' he said.

'Perhaps we should have been more 
forward leaning in the West collectively in intervening to try and head 
off what was happening here before it happened.'

Earlier this week Mr Cameron raised the prospect of weapons falling into terrorist hands.

‘Elements affiliated to al-Qaeda in the 
region have attempted to acquire chemical weapons for probable use in 
Syria,’ the Prime Minister said. 

Britain is currently providing 
‘non-lethal’ equipment to the Syrian rebels but Foreign Secretary 
William Hague has, with the support of France, been working had to lift a
European Union arms embargo.

US confirmation of British and French 
reports that the Syrian army was using chemical weapons against the 
rebels has increased the prospect of weapons being passed to the rebels.

Mr Hague said earlier this week the West 'must do more’ to put pressure on the 
Assad regime to reach a peaceful settlement with the rebels and stop the
bloodshed which the UN says has so far cost in excess of 93,000 lives.

The Defence Secretary’s comments also 
come at a time when he is being asked to make even more cuts to his 
department as part of the Chancellor’s comprehensive spending review. 
His is one of the few departments yet to have agree cuts at part of the 
review.

Last month Mr Hammond publicly warned any further cuts to his 
department would come at a cost to Britain’s military capability. Under current 
budget cuts Army personnel will have been cut by a fifth to 82,000, their
lowest level since the end of the 19th century.
