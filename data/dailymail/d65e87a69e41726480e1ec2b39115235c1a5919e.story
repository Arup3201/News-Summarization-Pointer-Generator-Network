Police are investigating claims that a leading anti-terrorism officer enjoyed secret nights of passion in the home of maverick MP George Galloway.

According to the controversial politician, Detective Inspector Afiz Khan had an affair with Mr Galloway’s aide Aisha Ali Khan.

And he claims the pair conspired to run a 'dirty tricks' campaign against him and his Respect political party.

Det Insp Khan, a member of the Met’s elite SO15 anti-terror squad, has been moved to ‘restricted duties’ while the matter is investigated.

Mr Galloway has suspended Miss Khan, 32, a mother of one, from her post and police are believed to be seeking her to discuss the matter.

A spokesman for the MP claimed last 
night that the pair’s smear campaign included encouraging the Guardian 
newspaper to run a lengthy piece claiming Respect was involved in 
political thuggery in Bradford West, where 58-year-old Mr Galloway won a
shock by-election victory over Labour in March.

It was claimed that the couple slept at the MP’s house in Streatham, south London, while he was away in Indonesia.

As well as making a formal complaint 
to the police, the MP has tabled a motion in Parliament calling on the 
Home Secretary to make a statement on the issue.

Mr Galloway said he felt ‘violated’ by the events, and called for the officer to be sacked.

'It could not look worse than that a 
person whose job is essentially to police Britain’s Muslim community 
could have been coming and going, sleeping in my house when I was away, 
when I am the MP for tens of thousands of Muslims and heavily involved 
in issues that vitally affect the Muslim community,' he said.

George Galloway, pictured with wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, claimed the Met officer had sex with his aide in his house while he was abroad

'If he could not see that then he is too stupid to be a detective inspector in SO15. It is not enough for me that he has been placed on restrictive duties, which means counting pencils. He should be suspended.'

Mr Galloway’s spokesman and associate for the last 36 years, Ron McKay, said: 'Aisha Ali Khan had become George’s aide after turning up at the Respect headquarters in Bradford before his election campaign. I think she used to be a teacher.

'There was some concern that she had been involved with the Labour Party. She worked for George in Bradford and in London – and while he was away in Indonesia in June he gave her the keys to his house in Streatham.

'A short while after George came back there was a break-in at his house when he, his wife and Aisha were in, and the burglars made off with a parliamentary computer.

'Local police were investigating – but it was then that Aisha introduced Afiz Khan to George as a police officer and security expert who could help him beef up his home security.

'It transpired a few hours later that Insp Khan had declared to the cops investigating the burglary that they would find his fingerprints in the house because he had been sleeping in the house with Aisha while George was away.

'That was George’s rude introduction to what had been going on.

Scotland Yard said the officer has been placed on restricted duties pending an investigation by the Directorate of Professional Standards

'Since then George has been given incontrovertible evidence from emails that Insp Khan had been using his Met police email account and two fictitious accounts to communicate with her and use her as his agent to indulge in a dirty tricks campaign.

'We also found Aisha was the instigator of a Guardian story criticising Respect. We’ve got the emails between her and the Guardian and between her and Afiz. One email from his police account claims there was electoral fraud in George’s by-election.

'It’s clear he was keeping a close eye on George in his constituency.'

Mr Galloway’s team supplied a picture said to show the couple together. Miss Khan refused to comment on the allegations against her, while Det Insp Khan could not be contacted.

Former Labour MP Mr Galloway is renowned for courting controversy over a long and flamboyant political career.

Days after his by-election victory in Bradford, he took a fourth wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, who is 30 years his junior.

Only two months ago he was criticised for taking £80,000 a year from a TV station linked to Syria and Iran, and for using the insulting term ‘window licker’ against a disabled person on Twitter.

In his Parliamentary motion, he complains about 'the involvement of a very senior officer in SO15 in an apparent dirty tricks operation against the Hon Member for Bradford West'.

He claims: 'The officer, Afiz Khan, entered the Hon Member’s London home without his knowledge or consent, the Hon Member  never having met or heard of him, and he slept in the Hon Member’s home.' And he adds: 'Afiz Khan sent emails to an individual in the Hon Member’s office who acted as his agent and co-ordinated this operation from his police email account and from at least two other fake email accounts, duping, amongst others, the Guardian newspaper as to his true identity.'

The MP’s motion also alleges that Det Insp Khan used an alias to attack him on Facebook and elsewhere, 'all the while concealing that he was a senior serving police officer at Scotland Yard'.
