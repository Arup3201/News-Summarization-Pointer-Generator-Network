Birmingham Bears v Surrey (11am)

Hampshire v Lancashire Lightning (2.30pm)

Finalist 1 v Finalist 2 (6.45pm)

Jason Roy was one of Tom Maynard’s best friends so it was perhaps not surprising he went to a ‘weird’ place last season following the tragic death of one of English cricket’s brightest lights.

Maynard’s passing, aged 23, on a south London railway line in 2012 shocked the cricketing world and devastated a Surrey squad that is only now starting to come to terms with his tragic loss.

Roy’s form deserted him, averaging just eight in the County Championship while also struggling in shorter formats, but this season he has been transformed and now stands on the brink of an England place.

LANCASHIRE LIGHTNING

Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has been named in Lancashire’s squad for finals day despite spending the last three weeks in a fish and chip van filming a documentary for Sky about the nation’s favourite dish. Jimmy Anderson and Jos Buttler are also included in Lancashire’s squad. It is understood Flintoff - who came out of retirement to play two T20 games earlier this season - is unlikely to play, but his inclusion raises the intriguing possibility of him bowling to his 2005 Ashes winning team-mate Kevin Pietersen if Lancashire and Surrey reach the final.

HAMPSHIRE 

Hampshire captain James Vince is highly regarded by England’s hierarchy and the young batsman has a chance to rubber-stamp his inclusion in the Three Lions T20 squad with a strong showing on Saturday. Hampshire, beaten finalists last year, are playing in their fifth consecutive finals day. They take on Lancashire in the second semi-final at 2.30pm.

BIRMINGHAM BEARS 

England batsman Ian Bell has a chance to showcase his T20 credentials as part of the Warwickshire squad that face Surrey in the first semi-final. The England star is under pressure for his one-day international place with uncapped Alex Hales breathing down his neck after some fine displays for Nottinghamshire. A strong showing on Saturday could help Bell’s case.

‘Tom’s death had a huge effect on myself and all the mates around him and the club and his family,’ Roy said ahead of Saturday’s Twenty20 Finals Day.

‘It was a hugely tragic situation. I think we have moved forward very well this year since then. I’m very impressed with how everyone has come out and done this season.

‘Last year I was just in a weird place with cricket. I didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere with my game. I was concentrating on too many exterior factors other than watching the ball.

‘I’m in a much better place this season. Things outside cricket can affect how you play sometimes and it’s just about finding a way of eradicating those negative things.

‘The last two years I have matured a huge amount. Obviously a few things I have been through off the field have made that possible.’

Talented: Maynard's death affected the Surrey squad and forced them all to 'mature', says Roy

On the brink: Roy's outstanding opening for Surrey this season has led to calls for him to play for England

Saturday’s appearance at Edgbaston against Warwickshire in the last four of the Natwest T20 Blast will provide Roy with another opportunity to demonstrate his England credentials.

If Surrey defend their title, they will owe a significant debt to Roy after a season that has seen him elevate himself to the brink of international recognition.

Earlier this month he hit five sixes in six balls for England Lions against Sri Lanka and he has been instrumental in powering Surrey into the T20 semi-finals with some outstanding hitting at the top of the order.

It says a lot about how much the South-African born star has improved this season that he remains frustrated he was not able to join an elite club of batsmen to have hit six maximums in an over.

‘Not much has changed technique-wise this season, but mentally I have been a lot more relaxed, taking each game as it comes,’ the 24-year-old said.

‘If I do well I stay level and if I do badly I try and stay on the same level. Not having too many ups and downs has been a massive factor.

Praise: Roy says that Surrey's coaching team of Graham Ford and Alec Stewart have been 'good' for him

‘Last season, being younger and a bit more immature I would get upset and angry. I knew in my mind what I wanted to achieve but I wasn’t achieving it and that’s probably the most frustrating thing for anyone. So this time around I’m just staying relaxed.’

Surrey’s new coaching regime of South African Graham Ford and club legend Alec Stewart - replacing Chris Adams - has clearly had a calming effect on a squad of players taken to the brink by their friend’s premature passing.

‘Graham Ford has been very good for me,’ Roy said. ‘He’s very basic, which is exactly what I was looking for. He’s basic and to the point and I know as long as I keep my basics right then I’m strong and in a good place.’

Unlucky to miss out on a place in England’s one-day squad to face India, Roy can expect a call up for the solitary Twenty20 international at Edgbaston on September 7.

‘If I can keep scoring runs I think anything’s possible to be honest,’ he said.

‘I feel like I can handle myself at all levels so fingers crossed I get the opportunity to do so and score runs.’
