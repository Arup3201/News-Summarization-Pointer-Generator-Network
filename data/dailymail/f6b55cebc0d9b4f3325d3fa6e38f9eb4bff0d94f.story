Peruvian couple Michael and Cristina have tested the limits of their dog Nano's willingness to remain their best friend by taking him up paragliding.

Luckily for them, the three-year-old pug appeared to love every minute of it.

Cristina and Michael, both aged 53 and experienced paragliders, took their beloved pooch up in the air over the Costa Verde's cliff in Lima, Peru, away from the crowds of the resort Miraflores.

Nano was strapped into a custom harness made by Michael before they took to the air on the gorgeous South American coastline. 

Cristina, who works as a business manager with partner Michael, said: 'Nano is our first pet so Michael wanted to take Nano to fly with him.

'Michael made him a harness at home and the next thing we were up in the air with him.

'It was Nano's first ever experience of paragliding and he absolutely loved it.'

Nano was relaxed throughout the flight, as seen in the video of his maiden voyage to the skies.

But he also shows plenty of interest in the scenery and other gliders while cosied up to his owner.

'He was watching the other paragliders flying around us and kept looking at people on the cliff tops,' Cristina said.

'Me and Michael are very experienced paragliders but it was amazing to take Nano on his first trip.

'He was pretty surprised and was very curious throughout the journey.'
