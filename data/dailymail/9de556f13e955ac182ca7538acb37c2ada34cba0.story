A passenger killed when a light aircraft crashed in a flaming wreck yesterday afternoon only went up in the plane after a chance offer while visiting an airfield, according to local reports.

They say the 'family man' had not been intending to fly. But after accepting an offer, he died along with the plane's pilot when their Yak 52 aircraft came down near the village of North Weald in Essex.

The passenger was named as father-of-one and flying enthusiast Simon Chamberlain.

Fuselage: Wreckage of the crashed Yak 52 was being removed from the airfield near Writtle, Essex

Debris: The plane had taken off from the nearby North Weald airfield before getting into trouble, police said

He served as secretary and trustee of the North Weald Airfield Museum, both voluntary roles.

Mr Chamberlain's family said in a 
statement: 'Yesterday there was a light aircraft crash near Writtle in 
Essex. Simon Chamberlain, who was 29, was the passenger in that plane. 
He would have been 30 in May.

'Lizzie,
 his wife, has lost her best friend and soul mate. His son, Charlie, who
 will be two years old in August, has lost his father. And his parents, 
Paul and Steph, have lost a loving son. We love him more than anything 
the world.

'Our hearts also go out to the other person involved in this tragedy.

'We know that you will respect the fact that we now need time to grieve and give us the space to heal.'

Onlookers
 have said the plane appeared to be attempting a mid-air somersault 
shortly before it 'nose-dived' straight into the ground and burst into 
flames at around 3pm yesterday.

Fire crews doused the burning aircraft
 with foam, but the two men inside were killed. The pilot is also yet to
 be named, but emergency services confirmed that both men are from 
Essex.

The plane had taken off from the nearby North Weald airfield before getting into trouble, police said.

Local news website Everything Epping Forest
 has said that the pilot was an 'enthusiastic' member of the community 
around the airfield, and had been visiting with his family when he 
accepted the offer of a chance flight.

Tristram Taylor, 27, saw the crash while driving and stopped to call 999.

He
 said: 'We saw it dip behind a hedge and usually they come up, we see 
stunt planes carrying out moves around here quite a lot, but this time 
it didn't.

'We went a bit further down the road and I could then see the tail end of the plane on the ground and a lot of smoke.

'I got out and ran towards it with a couple of Army cadets that were in the car behind. They were probably only about 15 or 16 years old.

'There were flames coming from the cockpit, they must have been about 10ft high. The wind was very strong in the field. I could feel the heat of the flames just a few feet away.

'It was horrific. The plane was popping and spitting where the fuel was catching fire. I don't think anything could have been done.'

Eyewitness Sam Gildersleeve, from nearby Ongar, was having lunch with friends when he saw the plane flying low.

Mr Gildersleeve said: 'We all looked at the sky and the plane attempted to do a somersault unsuccessfully, we heard a popping sound and noticed the plane did not re-emerge.

'We then noticed smoke coming from the site in the field where the plane had crashed. Shortly after the emergency services appeared.'

The aircraft's tail can be seen at the crash scene. Fire crews said it was fully alight when they arrived

A team from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch are now at the scene

Chef Mark Reynolds saw the incident 
unfold while he was taking his break outside the nearby Fox and Goose 
pub and rushed to help.

He said: 'We were watching the plane doing an aerobatic display over the fields. It was very impressive.

'We
 kept saying the plane was very low in the air and the next thing it 
nose nose-dived into the ground, completely vertical, and burst in to 
flames.

'It was surreal, we started running towards it to see if we could help anyone.

'It was quite a way off. When we got to the plane it was engulfed in flames. He was very badly burned.'

Mr Reynolds, 47, added: 'It was like something you see in a movie. It was very disturbing, something that will stay with me.'

Fire crews, who were called from three nearby fire stations to the crash scene, later covered the wreckage, which will now be examined by investigators

A police spokesman said: 'Two people have 
died after a YAK 52 light aircraft was seen to be in difficulties and 
then crashed into a field off the A414 near Cooksmill Green around 2.55pm today.

'Emergency services rushed to the scene and fire crews extinguished the fire caused when the plane crashed.

'Two men, a pilot and his passenger - both from Essex, were on board. The plane had flown out from North Weald airfield.'

This morning officers said they were not treating the incident as suspicious.

Firefighters from nearby Chelmsford, Colchester and Maldon attended the scene and a team from the Department of Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch has also arrived.

The plane was 'completely alight' 
when firefighters arrived at the scene near the village of Cooksmill 
Green, Essex Fire and Rescue Service said.

A spokesman said: 'On arrival the incident commander reported that the plane was completely alight. Crews used foam and had extinguished the fire by 3.55pm.'

North Weald airfield is
 used as a base by North Weald Flying Services, who train pilots in 
formation flying using Yak 52 aircraft, like that which crashed.

The group declined to comment on the accident this afternoon.

The airfield is owned by Epping 
Forest District Council, who sent Deputy Chief Executive Derek Macnab to
 the scene soon after the incident.

He
 said: 'People at North Weald Airfield are shocked and dismayed 
following reports of an aircraft crash at Cooksmill Green earlier this 
afternoon.

'Details are yet to be confirmed but our thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of those involved.'

Police closed part of the A414, which 
runs from Chelmsford to Harlow, in both directions while they dealt with
 the incident, but reopened it shortly before 6pm.

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'The ambulance service was called at 2.55pm today, dispatching an ambulance, three paramedic officers, the hazardous area response team (HART) and Magpas helimedics.

'Despite the best efforts of crews the casualties were sadly pronounced dead at the scene. Ambulance resources have now been stood down.'

Two men, instructor Simon Hulme, 33, and his student Spencer Bennett, 43, were killed in a similar accident in 2011 when another Yak 52 crashed into a lake near Maldon, Essex.

Mr Bennett was on a three-day flying course when the plane he was being trained in came down.

In that incident, the plane was being used as an aerobatics trainer and also took off from the North Weald airfield.

In July 2006, two people died when a Yak 52 crashed and burst into flames as it came in to land at Bournemouth Airport.

And in January 2003, Falklands veteran Anthony Hunt, 48, died along with his brother Ian, 45, when their aircraft crashed in a field on the Easton Neston estate, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, while practising aerobatic manoeuvres.

His family were awarded Â£270,000 damages by the High Court in 2006 after an investigation found that during maintenance a short screwdriver had become wedged into the wires that operated the rear elevators of the plane.

Two people also died when a Yak 52 crashed in the Kaluga region, south of Moscow in Russia, in August 2009.

The Yakovlev Yak 52 is a two-seater propeller aircraft first built in the Soviet Union in the 1970s.

The former Soviet Air Force training aircraft is now a popular plane for aerobatic flying around the world.

It has a reported top speed of 223mph and a service life of 30 years. It is not known how old the aircraft which crashed today was.
