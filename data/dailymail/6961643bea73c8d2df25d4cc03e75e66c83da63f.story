Nearly three months after his death in a fiery car crash, Paul Walker's will is finally being settled.

Today, a judge in Santa Barbara court appointed the actor's father, Paul Walker Sr, as executor of his estate - just as Walker detailed in his will.

Also in the will was Walker's wish that 15-year-old daughter Meadow be raised by his mother, Cheryl Walker.

Tragic end: Walker, who became famous for his role in the Fast & Furious franchise, was in the passenger seat of a red Porsche when his friend lost control of the car and crashed

Walker's entire family was in court today, including Meadow and her mother Rebecca Soteros, but a decision has not yet been made on who will be the teen's guardian. For now, she is living with her grandmother.

Left behind: Walker had just recently reconnected with his 15-year-old daughter Meadow (right), who came to live with him in Southern California in 2011 after spending most of her life with her mother in Hawaii

While it seems unconventional that Meadow would be raised by her grandmother instead of her mother in Hawaii, both the teen and her mom are reportedly OK with the set-up since Meadow wants to continue living in California. 

The actor, who became famous for his role in the Fast and Furious series, died at the end of November while riding in a red Prosche with his friend in Santa Clarita, California.

Walker was in the passenger seat when friend Roger Rodas lost control of the vehicle and crashed.

The early death was made even more tragic by the fact that Walker had just recently reconnected with his daughter.

Walker had been mostly absent from Meadow's life as she grew up with her mother Rebecca Soteros in Hawaii. In 2011, Meadow moved to California to live with her father. 

That move had a profound affect on Walker in the final years of his life.

'She's the best partner I've ever had,' Walker told Entertainment Weekly last year. 'I've never had anything like this in my life. I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.'

As evidence for how much he loved his daughter, Walker left his entire $25million fortune to Meadow in his will.
