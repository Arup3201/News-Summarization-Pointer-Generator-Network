Floyd Mayweather has provided a timely reminder of his wealth by getting two women to count out $100,000 in cash on his bed while he uses one of his expensive watches to see who can do it fastest.

Mayweather outpointed a game Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas to unify the welterweight division and remain unbeaten in 46 professional fights on Saturday night, and thought he'd celebrate by counting out his fortune.

The American, holding a case of 18 
watches, posted saying: '@thatjessilee and @badmedina are playing a 
game, to see who can count to a $100,000 the fastest. This is what they 
do when they get bored. #TheMoneyTeam #FollowBeautifulLadies'

It's fair to say $100,000 is pretty small fry for the five-time world champion, who claimed he earned $70m from the Maidana fight. He earned $32m for the fight, staged at the MGM Grand, and also said he made $38m from pay-per-view television rights.

The two women pictured, Jessi Lee and Doralie Medina, are part of Mayweather's entourage, known as The Money Team (TMT).

Mayweather
 has selected Bolton as one of the six venues on the English leg of his 
world tour, leading to fevered speculation that a match-up with Amir 
Khan could soon be on the cards.

Bolton
 is, of course, the home town of Khan, and the American's announcement 
does suggest that any potential fight is moving closer to fruition.

Mayweather,
 widely heralded as the best boxer on the planet, will top the bill at a
 sportsman's dinner held at the Macron Stadium - the home of Bolton 
Wanderers - on Monday 23 June.
