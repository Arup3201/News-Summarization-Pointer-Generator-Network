The U.S. has made a rare public condemnation towards Israel after Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon reportedly criticized Secretary of State John Kerry's peace plans for Palestine.

Israel's most widely-read newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, published comments today Yaaloon made in private before one of Kerry's trips to the region.

'Secretary of State John Kerry - who has come to us determined and is acting out of an incomprehensible obsession and a messianic feeling - cannot teach me a single thing about the conflict with the Palestinians,' Yaalon reportedly said.

'The only thing that can save us is if Kerry wins the Nobel prize and leaves us alone.' Yaalon added.

Following the story, U.S. officials called out the statements. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said if the statements were true they were 'offensive and inappropriate, especially given all that the United States is doing to support Israel's security needs'.

Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to address the statements in Parliament today, reaffirming loyalty to the U.S. 'our greatest ally'. 

'Even when we have disagreements with the United States, they always pertain to the matter at hand, and are not personal,' Netanyahu said.

Yaalon himself responded to the comments in a written statement - issuing much the same message as Netanyahu but without denying that he said the statements.

'When there are disagreements, we work through them inside the room - including with Secretary of State Kerry, with whom I hold many conversations about Israel's future,' Yaalon said.

Yaalon has been critical in the past about any future peace with Palestine.

Before serving as defense minister, Yaalon was military chief but left that position before the 2005 Gaza pullout which he was against.

He's become more outspoken lately with the recent resumption of peace talks with Palestine after a three-year stop.

'There are no actual negotiations with the Palestinians,' Yaalon said. 'The Americans are holding negotiations with us and in parallel with the Palestinians. So far, we are the only side to have given anything â€“ the release of murderers â€“ and the Palestinians have given nothing.'

In order to start negotiations, the Israelis agreed to free 104 of the longest-serving Palestinians.

The controversial report appeared one day after the funeral of Ariel Sharon, Israel's former prime minister, which was attended by Vice President Joe Biden.
