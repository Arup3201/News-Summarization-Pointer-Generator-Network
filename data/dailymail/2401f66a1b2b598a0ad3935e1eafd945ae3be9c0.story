Casey Kasem's body was flown from the funeral home in Tacoma, Washington to a funeral home in Montreal, Canada on July 14, two days before a judge ordered Casey's widow Jean Kasem to keep the body in Tacoma for an autopsy.

But mysteriously, Casey's body never arrived.

A representative for Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter, has confirmed that her father's body is missing.

MailOnline has learned that Casey's body was put on a plane by staff at the Gaffney Funeral Home in Tacoma on July 14 and shipped to Urgel Bourgie Funeral Homes in Montreal. But staff at the Canadian funeral parlor say they have no record for any arrangements for the arrival of Kasem's body under his name, his birth name Kemal Amen Kasem or his wife Jean's name.

Mystery: They body of Casey Kasem has gone missing more than a month after his death, according to reports

Mystery: According to Casey's death certificate, the radio icon's body was sent from the Gaffney Funeral home in Tacoma to a funeral home in Montreal, Canada on July 14. It also lists the cause of death as pending and an address for Jean Kasem in Jerusalem, Israel

Family sources told TMZ they
 believe the radio host's widow Jean, who has long battled with his 
three daughters from his first marriage, has taken the body from a 
funeral home in Tacoma.

But MailOnline confirmed that Casey's body was shipped by the Gaffney Funeral Home on July 14 to Montreal, two days before a judge ordered her to 
keep it in Tacoma so that an autopsy could be carried out, at the request of
 one of Kasem's daughters, the website reported.

A call to Jean Kasem's attorney has not been returned.

But her address listed on Casey's death certificate is in Jerusalem, Israel.

The death certificate also lists the cause of death as 'pending.'

On Wednesday, Pierce County Superior Court Judge Ronald Culpepper ordered her to ensure Kasem's remains are preserved and that his body remains at the funeral home until the court decides on the autopsy petition.

Kerri Kasem had said she was worried that her stepmother may prevent the autopsy by having his remains moved to Canada or cremated, according to the statement she filed in court.

She said she learned from the director of the funeral home that Jean Kasem planned to have an autopsy done and that worried her because she wondered why it was needed.

'I'm concerned about the results of any autopsy Jean Kasem may have commissioned and how they might be used,' Kasem wrote.

'Consequently, I thought it would be best to ask the Washington Court to allow me to have an autopsy conducted by a forensic pathologist of my own selection.'

Kasem's death certificate says the cause of his death is still undetermined.

The autopsy is key to an ongoing criminal investigation into elderly abuse.

Investigators are looking into his daughter's claims that Jean took him on a week-long car ride to keep him away from his family. She believes the journey caused him to develop bed sores that contributed to his death.

Kasem, the radio host of 'American Top
 40' and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's 
sidekick Shaggy, died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, 
Washington.

He had suffered 
from a form of dementia, and his three adult children fought a bitter 
legal battle with Jean, Kasem's second wife of 34 years, over control of
 his health care in his final months.

His widow has accused the DJ's children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following his death.

Mrs Kasem accused Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could be cashed in.

But Kerri hit back, saying that Jean hadn't had Casey's body flown out to L.A. for burial because she was trying to deflect attention from the imminent investigation into elderly abuse.
