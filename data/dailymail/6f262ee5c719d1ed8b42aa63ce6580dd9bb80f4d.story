A student who became obsessed with his singing teacher after falling in love while learning Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' has been ordered to stay away from her.

Ashley Formby, 27, became infatuated with tutor Helen Sedgwick during their one-to-one music classes in which they learnt a number of love songs, including the Titanic power ballad.

Formby, from Llandrindod Wells, Mid Wales, spent four months trying to woo his 26-year-old crush, and even told her he wanted to be her lover and not her pupil.

He asked her to 'be my love' and told her she was 'the most beautiful girl in the world' before leaving a model replica of the Titanic as a 'romantic gift' at her home.

However, Ms Sedgwick shunned his advances, and after continually being bombarded with love letters, emails and an array of gifts, reported him to police for stalking.

Prosecutor Sharon Anderson said: 'She ignored him but during March and April he sent her flowers, gifts, emails and texts declaring his love for her.

'Ms Sedgwick responded telling him she was not interested in his approaches and found them inappropriate.

'She said that she did not want to provide him lessons but some of his messages became abusive.

'He replied calling her a spoilt brat.

'The tone of these new emails caused her anxiety and she was worried he'd attended her address.'

Llandrindod Wells magistrates heard how officers served Formby with a harassment notice to stop him – but he ignored it and contacted her again to say he didn't want to fall in love with anyone else ever again.

Over the course of the following 12 weeks he showered her with eight emails, a romantic card, three texts, gifts and turned up at her home with flowers.

Ms Sedgwick, who also teaches piano at a primary school, called the police again because he would not stop his advances.

Formby was then interviewed by officers and told them he felt he had a 'special bond' with Ms Sedgwick and that he had been 'devastated' when she rejected him.

The court heard how Formby fell for the music teacher after she taught him Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', which features in Titanic. Formby also sent Ms Sedgwick a replica of the sunken ship as a 'romantic gift'

Josie Flicker, defending, said: 'He doesn't threaten violence, he is quite eloquent and shows genuine emotion.

'But he became quite childish when she rejected his advances.

'Since his arrest there has been no repetition, he seems to have heeded the warning from police.'

Formby, of Llandrindod Wells, admitted pursuing a course of harassment when he appeared at court on Friday.

He was given a restraining order to not to contact Ms Sedgwick or go within 200 yards of her home and the case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports.
