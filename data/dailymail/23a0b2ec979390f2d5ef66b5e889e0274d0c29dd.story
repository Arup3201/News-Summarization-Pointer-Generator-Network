Quit: Alice Arnold left her job at the BBC in December after 20 years

Former BBC newsreader Alice Arnold has admitted she is now free to talk about gay issues since she left the corporation.

Alice Arnold – the partner of one of 
the corporation’s star presenters, Clare Balding – said she could not voice her opinion when she worked at the BBC.

In an interview with the Gaydio network, Ms Arnold said quitting her role as a Radio 4 newsreader in December  has now given her the freedom to discuss a range of issues.

In the interview at the weekend she was asked if she would now become 'more of a spokeswoman for marriage equality.'

Ms Arnold, who lives in West London, replied 'Yeah, absolutely.'

She added: 'I wasn’t allowed to give my opinion on equal marriage when I was reading the news.

'If you are reading the news you are absolutely bound not to have an 
opinion inside or outside the BBC on any of those topics so I was not 
allowed to talk about it.'

'If I ever did an interview for the press I wasn't allowed to express an opinion on that and of course I had an opinion so it releases me now to be able to speak about it.'

When one of the presenters described how they got 'really, really angry' listening to gay marriage debates in the Parliament, Ms Arnold agreed saying 'It brings out 
some horrible stuff doesn’t it and it brings out some very unkind 
thoughts and expressions, I think.

Speaking out: Alice Arnold right, – the partner of one of the corporation’s star presenters, Clare Balding, left, – said her opinion was stifled when she worked at the BBC

'That is quite disconcerting when an 
argument comes up about it and you are suddenly realise that people do 
not treat you equally and don’t think of you equally and it is hurtful.'

Since
leaving BBC Radio 4 after 20 years, she has also changed her Twitter 
bio, which now reads: 'Ex-radio 4 newsreader. Can say what I like now!'

She
has previously spoken out against the corporation, saying earlier this 
month the BBC is too concerned with the appearance of its female 
presenters, according to one of its former newsreaders

She told the London Evening Standard:
'You look at men of a certain age or appearance who are on TV and 
think: "If you were a woman, you wouldn't be there.'

Union: Ms Arnold entered into a Civil Partnership with television presenter Clare Balding in 2006 - the pair live in London

'It's a constant struggle in a culture that prizes looks and youth so highly, but the BBC needs to stand up and say "No".

'Clare is a very good example of breaking that mould.'

Ms Arnold, 50, said her partner has got where she is through 'talent'.

She
told the newspaper: 'If you're in a position where people will look at 
you and listen to you then you have to grasp that opportunity. We both 
feel very strongly about it.'

In
a further blow to the BBC, Ms Arnold also criticised the Today 
programme, Radio 4's flagship news and current affairs show, for a lack 
of female voices.

She said the show 'badly' lets Radio 4 down by having just Sarah Montague out of five presenters.

The
former actor and lawyer said it is 'such a missed opportunity' but 
praised the station as a whole for using 'serious' women presenters.

Ms Arnold  entered into a Civil Partnership with television presenter Clare Balding in 2006.

Speaking about the union last month she said 'We are legally bound to each other. It’s lovely but a bit of a mouthful. ‘Are you married?’ people ask. ‘I am civilly partnered,’ I reply.

'It doesn’t exactly trip off the tongue.'
