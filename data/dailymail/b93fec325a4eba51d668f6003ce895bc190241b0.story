Only two British universities have made it onto China's list of the top 20 higher education institutions in the world.

Cambridge and Oxford maintained the same positions as last year in the 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities, coming in fifth and tenth respectively.

America dominates the list with Harvard claiming the top place, as it has done since the survey began in 2003.

Cambridge was ranked as the leading British university in this year's Academic Ranking of World Universities coming fifth out of 500 institutions.

Cambridge is the highest placed British institution, according to research compiled by Shanghai’s Jiaotong University.

The University of Oxford ranked tenth in the list, keeping its position since last year's ranking.

Oxford just squeezed into the top ten, while University College London (ranked 21st) and Imperial College (ranked 24th) failed to make the list which selects the best 20 of 1,200 academic establishments across the world.

The winners are chosen in consideration of six factors which include number of Nobel Prize winners, number of 'highly cited' researchers and  the number of articles published by leading magazines in their field.

The full list ranks the 500 best globally, but the top 20 tend to become the most sought after by Chinese students.

American institutions come out on top with five colleges ranking within the top five. Stanford, University of California, Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [MIT] all appear at the top of the list.

The annual report has come under fire in the past for being too focused on success in scientific disciplines, rather than across all subjects.

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2012-2013 placed Oxford University as number two in the world, behind California’s Institute of Technology.
