Dr Mann woke up in an awkward position. From then the slightest movement or touch caused pain

As a GP, Dr Nick Mann is used to seeing people in pain - and as someone 
who's suffered from it for years himself, he is particularly 
sympathetic.

In his 20s he damaged a disc in his neck during a 
surfing accident, causing it to bulge or 'slip'. Over the next 12 years,
 more of the discs in his neck became damaged, leaving him with chronic 
stinging pain in his back, arms and shoulders.

But this was nothing compared with what came next. One day Dr Mann woke up having slept in an awkward position.

From
 then on the slightest movement of his right arm, or even being touched 
on his upper back, caused waves of excruciating pain.

'The pain 
intensified over several months to the point where, having been able to 
carry on "as normal" for 12 years despite a series of slipped discs, I 
became unable to lift a stethoscope to listen to someone's chest,' 
explains Dr Mann, 51, who works at an NHS surgery in East London.

'If anyone even gently brushed against my back I would get a jolt of incredible pain and my knees would buckle.'

As
 well as the pain, his right hand became a mottled red colour. And, most
 remarkably, the nails and hair on his arm grew faster, as did the bones
 in his right hand - over months it grew bigger than his left hand.

His doctor gave him prescriptions for painkillers, but this did nothing.

'There
 appeared to be no answers as to why this had happened,' says Dr Mann, 
who lives in Hackney, East London, with wife, Karen, 48, and their 
children aged 14 and 11.

His doctor referred him to a neurosurgeon. 
'He treated me like a malingerer,' recalls Dr Mann. 'It was the most 
terrifying time of my life.

'I couldn't work and I feared I might 
never do so again at that point. My right arm, as well as being painful,
 began to lose its power. Despite trying to keep it moving, it gradually
 lost strength and co-ordination, until four months later it just hung 
uselessly by my side.

'I could do everyday things like write and eat
 with a knife and fork but it was extremely hard. My wife was pregnant 
with our second son and she did not need another dependent at this 
point.'

Six months after Dr Mann's symptoms began, an osteopath 
suggested the problem might be shoulder-hand syndrome - a form of 
complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Suddenly Dr Mann realised he 
had a diagnosis. CRPS is a greater-than-normal reaction of the body to 
an injury, resulting in a 'scalding' pain at the slightest touch.

'The
 pain is so bad that it is not uncommon for people to say they want to 
have their affected limb amputated,' says Dr Andreas Goebel, a senior 
lecturer in pain medicine at Liverpool University.The syndrome usually affects just one limb, commonly the  arm or leg.

As
 well as pain, the skin of the affected limb can change colour and may 
be warmer or cooler than normal. Hair and nail growth can dramatically 
increase or decrease (possibly as the nervous system helps regulate this
 growth).

In time - generally months - the limbs can become weaker 
and frozen in position, not only because it hurts to move them, but 
because it becomes physically impossible to do so.

Although the 
condition was first identified during the American Civil War, CRPS's 
cause is as yet not fully understood. However, it's thought to stem from
 a problem with the nerves, as it can occur after a major injury to a 
nerve.

This is referred to as CRPS type  2. It can also occur after 
surgery or a mild knock. Around 10  per cent of those who have a 
fractured limb will develop it, when it is known as CRPS type 1.

'Just
 the trauma of a vaccination is enough to trigger it in some,' says 
Candy McCabe, a consultant nurse at the Royal National Hospital for 
Rheumatic Diseases in Bath and professor of nursing and pain sciences at
 the University of the West of England, Bristol.

'However, in 9 per cent of cases the condition occurs without any obvious injury,' she says.It may also be an autoimmune condition, suggests Dr Goebel.

'We
 are looking at the possibility that with CRPS the immune system alters 
the way the nerves function - all the symptoms are nerve-related.

'Nerves
 can secrete neuropeptides, protein-like molecules that nerve cells use 
to communicate with each other, and in excess these can lead to swelling
 and discolouration of the skin - as happens with CRPS.' Professor 
McCabe adds there is no 'absolute evidence' of this yet.

The proportion of people with back pain who can't identify the cause

'What we do know is that even if it has an autoimmune component, things quite quickly get driven by the brain,' she says.

Quite
 why limbs should become useless is not clear. 'What we think happens is
 that people feel as if they can't use the affected limbs and this in 
time alters the way the brain talks to these areas,' says Professor 
McCabe. 'This is most common among young females - their joints can 
become fixed in an unusual position.'

The syndrome is three times 
more common in women and is most common among post-menopausal women, 
'which suggests some hormonal element', says Professor McCabe.

Physiotherapy
 can help keep the joint mobile, 'but it needs to be started as soon as 
possible to have best effects and that depends on an early diagnosis', 
she adds.

Yet although it is not an uncommon condition - affecting 
around 16,000 people in Britain - few doctors have heard of CRPS. 'It's 
not taught in medical schools, and many doctors will never even have 
heard it,' says Professor McCabe.

'There is no definitive test - 
diagnosis depends on the patients explaining their symptoms and the 
doctor understanding what they mean.'

Patients commonly experience a delay in diagnosis and some may be told their symptoms are in the mind, says Professor McCabe.

'Yet
 it is a very real condition that can be absolutely horrific. I have 
seen tough miners in tears with the pain of this condition.'

In 80 
per cent of cases, the condition resolves itself within a year, but for 
the rest, the condition can become progressively worse.

Morphine and
 other strong painkillers have little effect, but nerve blocks - 
injections of local anaesthetic into the affected nerves - can help, as 
can spinal cord stimulation. This involves having a device fitted into 
your abdomen or buttocks that sends electrical pulses to your spinal 
cord, which alters how you sense pain.

This helps in around half of 
all patients, says Dr Goebel. He has recently completed a study using a 
drip of immunoglobulin (a form of antibodies used by the immune system).

In his study, published in the journal Rheumatology last year, a 
weekly infusion stopped the pain symptoms for two sufferers within 
months - even though they had been suffering from the condition for five
 years.

'We expect it to be effective in a quarter of those with CRPS
 and if it is going to be effective it will start working straight 
away,' he says.

For Dr Mann, the road to recovery after his symptoms
 began in 2002 was agonisingly slow. 'I eventually saw an osteopath who 
was also a doctor. He thought the problem originated in my upper ribs,' 
he says. 'After the first treatment manipulating my upper ribs, the 
nature of the pain changed totally.'

He believes that for many 
people with CRPS the upper ribs may be the problem. 'Many CRPS sufferers
 report an initial shoulder impact,' he says. 'This can send a force 
from the shoulder through to the ribs so that they are a bit like bent 
sticks.

'When they're compressed they can rotate slightly. Very small
 displacements at the spinal end of the rib can cause small but 
important distortion of the sympathetic trunk.'

The sympathetic 
trunk is a bundle of nerve fibres carrying signals which control, for 
example, muscle reflexes, blood flow and pain transmission. If the ribs 
are disturbed enough, they can put pressure on these nerves and create 
havoc, adds Dr Mann.

'As my ribs were freed with osteopathy my pain 
reduced and my hand returned to colour pretty rapidly,' says Dr Mann, 
who is now living a full and active life.

He believes his experiences made him a better doctor.

'What
 happened to me gave me so much insight into how people with long-term 
pain suffer,' he says. 'They go to their GP and shuffle out with a 
prescription for painkillers or an appointment  to see the 
physiotherapist, but  these people keep coming back because no one finds
 out why they have this pain.

'Our system deals with the consequences, but has stopped looking for the causes.'
