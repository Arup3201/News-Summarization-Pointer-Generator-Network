The suburban mother suspected of running an upscale Manhattan brothel was back in court today to plead for her freedom as her lawyer told the judge his client is so broke she doesn't have 'two nickels to rub together'.

Anna Gristina, 44, who was arrested last month on a single prostitution charge after a five-year investigation, was said to have raked in more than $10million in the 15 years she allegedly ran her high-end brothel, charging clients up to $2,000 an hour.

But in court today, her lawyer Peter Gleason told the judge that the 44-year-old - who wore the same black-and-white patterned suit she sported at her first court hearing last week - said she is actually on the brink of poverty and cannot even afford to post bail.

Hearing: Anna Gristina was back in court this morning with her attorney Peter Gleason so a judge could decide whether or not she is entitled to court-paid defence

In an unusual move with was dubbed 'unethical' by prosecutors, he offered up his own $2.5million loft 
apartment as a 'gilded cage' for her to remain under a Dominique Strauss Kahn-type house arrest.

A judge will determine at a hearing on Thursday whether she can be freed on bail

With her hands cuffed behind her back, she appeared with three attorneys, looking more like an ordinary suburban mom rather than the owner of a millionaire prostitution empire, as prosecutors allege.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan was trying to decide whether the 'soccer mom' should be released on bail and adjourned the hearing until Thursday.

Questions were also raised today about whether or not Gristina is entitled to a court-paid defence.

Judge Merchuan said: 'The allegation is that she made over $10 million, possibly $15 million dollars, and that she has money "squirreled away".'

He then asked Gleason why he should allow Scottish-born Gristina to pick and choose her lawyers after the attorney made it clear Gristina wanted to replace court-appointed lawyer Richard Siracusa.

'She doesn't have two nickels to rub 
together, your honor,' Gleason said, pointing out that prosecutors 
have produced no evidence of Gristina's so-called hidden riches and that she is entitled to free legal representation. 

The judge told Gleason his client would not be getting preferential treatment but would keep the tax-payer funded lawyer until someone presented him with evidence that she was not broke.

He also denied her additional request to 
interview other prospective lawyers within the program.

Later in the hearing there were ugly and farcical scenes between 
Gleason and Siracusa as relations
between the two went into meltdown in front of the judge.

At one point, Siracusa dubbed Gleason 'a hindrance' whilst Mr 
Gleason he called for him to be removed from the case over a 
threatening email he allegedly sent.

As he postponed the hearing, Judge Marchan ruled that both lawyers should remain on the case for the time being.

Gleason, an ex-police officer, is working pro-bono on the case and doesn't have a lot of experience with criminal trials.

Gristina's bail was set at $2million 
after prosecutors told the judge she was a high flight risk since she 
had property and friends in different countries and has a British 
passport.

It is extremely unusual, but not unethical, for a lawyer to post bail for his client as Gleason has offered to do.

It is also believed he will allow his client, her husband Kevin and four children to stay at his condo in the city if she is ordered not to leave by the judge.

Gristina is offering to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet if the judge signs off on the deal.

Meanwhile, Gristina's co-defendant, former matchmaking service recruiter Jaynie Baker, remains at large but has hired a veteran defense lawyer, Robert Gottlieb. It is believed she is planning to hand herself in today or tomorrow. 

Speaking to the New York Post last 
week from her cell in Rikers Prison last week, the mother-of-four denied
that she reaped millions from a prostitution ring, claiming it was 
often hard to make ends meet and adding: 'I can show you my bills.'

She
added that she hated the thought of her children - particularly her 
nine-year-old son - knowing she was in prison, saying: 'I just don’t 
want my kids to see me in here.'

Speaking
from Rikers Island - where she is locked in solitary confinement - she 
recounted the hours-long questioning she received from prosecutors 
following her arrest on February 22.

Gristina's partner, has been on the run from police but she is expected 
to hand herself in today

Gristina, 44, was later charged with a single count of prostitution and believes the meager charge - which came after a five-year probe by investigators - proves they have nothing on her.

Gristina told the Post: 'They’re trying to sweat me out. They are clearly trying to break me... I’d bite my tongue off before I’d tell them anything.'

Her denial comes after the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said it recorded her speaking of her close relationships with police officers and federal agents who kept authorities off her back.

They allegedly kept her out of the frame even during high profile arrests, such as that of former Governor Eliot Spitzer in 2008, who was this week accused of tipping her off through a contact.

She admitted that she does have high-profile friends, but would often exaggerate her relationships with them during discussions to make herself 'sound better'.

She recounted the questioning by police as relentless and how her pleas for a lawyer fell on deaf ears.

She believes the police were trying to force a case rather than having anything concrete on her, telling the Post: 'If I’m such a big, high-profile madam, making all this money, and they had to investigate me for five years, why did they arrest me on a single promoting-prostitution charge - and only after I refused to talk to them?'
