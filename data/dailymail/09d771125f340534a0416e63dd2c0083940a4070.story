This newlywed couple put their own spin on their wedding day kiss by sealing their vows with a handshake.

Instead of kissing his bride, Tomy Szczypiorski and new wife Alexis Tyler launched into the elaborate handshake, which they had made up over their time together.

Every step of the ritual had a personal meaning to the couple, who kept adding elements to the greeting to signify different milestones in their lives together.

The couple begin their unusual handshake at the end of the wedding ceremony

The handshake started when the couple visited Poland together in the summer of 2011

A young family member taught the groom the 'Turtle, Barrel, Hot Dog, Fiver' routine, which the couple practiced

But despite their unconventional end to their marriage ceremony, they do eventually finish their handshake with a kiss.

Mr Szczypiorski explained that the handshake first started when the couple visited Poland, where his family are originally from, in 2011.

A young family member taught the groom the 'Turtle, Barrel, Hot Dog, Fiver' routine, which the couple practiced.

The couple then decided that other significant memories should become a part of their ritual

They say they hope to add other elements to the handshake in their married life together

Despite the unusual end to their vows, the couple do end the handshake with a traditional kiss

He said: 'I always told myself that it wasn't until I met 'the one; that I would bring that person to Poland to introduce her to our family's roots.

'This really special handshake was a great way to remember such a special time in our lives.'

The couple then decided that other significant memories should become a part of their ritual.

This included their trips to countries such as Egypt, Singapore and Australia.

They then added a step which sees them tapping their ring fingers to symbolise their engagement and then added in the kiss as a way of marking their wedding day.

The couple don't plan to stop evolving the handshake and hope to add more steps to it throughout married life

Mr Szczypiorski added: 'We knew that we would have to add a step for our wedding day, and what better way to end our new handshake than with a kiss.

'Our wedding kiss is now our eleventh step.Â It will be a great way to remember our wedding day and everything it represented for us.'

But even though they are now married, the couple don't plan to stop evolving the handshake and hope to add more steps to it throughout married life.

The images of their special handshake were captured by photographer Christina Bernales.
