She sent her daughter to private school rather than entrusting her education to the state.

But now Emma Thompson has decided the best results require a more unconventional route – and has removed her from school altogether.

The actress has had a purpose-built classroom constructed in the back garden after 15-year-old Gaia complained that she did not enjoy formal education.

Gaia - pictured here with her famous parents Emma Thompson and Greg Wise - has decided main stream education isn't for her

Her husband Greg Wise said that Gaia 'loves learning', but felt that preparing for GCSEs at school 'wasn't for her'.

The actor said: '[Gaia] is terribly focused and hard-working, but she didn't like the sausage factory of formal education. I've no argument with that.'

The 48-year-old added that he and Miss Thompson are yet to decide what their daughter should be taught, joking: 'I think we should just teach Latin and free-form dance. Really.'

Gaia will be joining up to 60,000 other children in England and Wales who are home-schooled – and as such will not have to follow the national curriculum. 

But this sense of the unknown seems to suit Mr Wise, who told The Times: 'I read a fascinating statistic recently that said 60 per cent of the kids at school will go on to do jobs that haven't yet been invented.'

Miss Thompson caused a stir last year when she revealed that she sent her daughter to a private school near their home in West Hampstead, North London.

The Oscar-winning actress, who has been a renowned supporter of Left-wing politics, said at the time she hoped Gaia would attend sixth-form at the state-run Camden School for Girls. However it is not known if she will still do so.

The 55-year-old star of Saving Mr Banks was educated there herself when it was still a grammar school. It remains a favourite of wealthy Left-wing parents, with alumni including actress Tamsin Greig and the children of several Blairite cabinet ministers.

Miss Thompson has previously urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time with their children. She recently put her own Hollywood career on hold, and said: 'You can't be a great mum and keep working all the time.

Wise told The Times Magazine that the 'sausage factory of formal education' was not right for her, so the couple have built a classroom in their garden

Gaia is the younger of Thompson's two children: she and Wise also informally adopted Tindyebwa Agaba (pictured right) when he was 16-years-old

'A year off was my birthday present to myself. I didn't actually act or write. I was just a mum. I taught drama at my daughter's school, cooked meals and had fun. I highly recommend others to do the same if they can afford it.'

She said she had decided that it wasn't always possible to juggle parenthood and a career, explaining: 'Motherhood is a full-time job.

'The only way I could have continued working would have been by delegating the running of the home to other people.'

Miss Thompson and Mr Wise – who appeared together in the 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility – also have a 28-year-old son, Tindyebwa Agaba. The couple adopted the former Rwandan child soldier when he was 16.
