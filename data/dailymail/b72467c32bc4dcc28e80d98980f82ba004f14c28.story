Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will not jeopardise Daniel Sturridge’s efforts to recapture full fitness by rushing him back just to help his side reach Wembley.

The England striker, who has not played for Liverpool since August 31, cleared the final hurdle in his rehabilitation yesterday when he began full training at the club’s Melwood base and he will again today.

With the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge looming, the temptation for Rodgers would be to unleash Sturridge. Liverpool showed in their draw with Bolton how much they need the striker and Chelsea could be vulnerable after being embarrassed by Bradford.

Liverpool are now unbeaten in their last eight games at Anfield: this draw, though, was their sixth stalemate in that sequence.

Rodgers will consult Sturridge and the club’s medical staff over the next 24 hours and only then will he decide if the 25-year-old has a role to play tomorrow, or if he is held back for Saturday’s clash with West Ham.

‘The other players have shown (enough) in this period, in the last seven weeks,’ said Rodgers. ‘He (Sturridge) wants to be involved in the big games. But we have to be realistic and careful. Chelsea is a very important game. If he feels right to be involved in some part, then we will maybe look at it. But it is a big risk.’

Another of Liverpool’s striking options, Mario Balotelli, was left out of the squad against Bolton. Rodgers spent an hour talking with him at Melwood last week and has explained what he needs to do to get back into his plans.

‘Mario still has a contribution to make — which I think he will do,’ said Rodgers, whose side were repeatedly denied by Bolton keeper Adam Bogdan. ‘I have to assess the players every single day when I watch them. That is how I pick the squad.’

Rodgers had no concerns about the way Liverpool played and was full of compliments for Bolton.

Bolton manager Neil Lennon was full of praise for his side, who drew 0-0 against Liverpool at Anfield 

Lennon reserved praise for Eidur Gudjohnsen, who played 90 minutes and almost won the game for Bolton

Neil Lennon’s side had two excellent chances, both of which fell to Eidur Gudjohnsen. ‘We had a strike force of a combined age of 268,’ said Lennon, who partnered Gudjohnsen with Emile Heskey. ‘We are asking them to keep going out there.

‘For Eidur to go 90 minutes at this level was a fantastic achievement. I think we have a chance (in the replay). Liverpool will have the lion’s share of possession and chances and we just have to stay in it.’
