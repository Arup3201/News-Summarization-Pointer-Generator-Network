Horrific: Amber Roderick, 19, pictured, lured a 16-year-old to a house party where she was plied with drink and drugs before being gang-raped at knifepoint

A teenage girl was today jailed for luring a 16-year-old to a house party where she was plied with drink and drugs before being gang-raped at knifepoint.

Amber Roderick, 19, smothered herself in dog shampoo and joined in with the horrific attack which left the vulnerable victim traumatised.

Today it emerged that she had only just been released from jail after forcing two boys, aged nine and ten, to perform sex acts on each other in a park.

Jailing her indefinitely for at least four years, Judge Bruce McIntyre said she posed a significant risk of harm to the public, including young people and children.

Roderick had met the 16-year-old in the street and later persuaded her to join a party which was being thrown by her friends.

She was given cannabis as well as vodka and coke drinks so strong she had to ask for them to be watered down, Reading Crown Court heard.

The initial assault took place on the top floor of the house, in Reading,  where Joseph Lawrence, 29, threatened the girl with a knife before forcing himself on her. Roderick also took part in the attack.

After the pair had finished, Lawrence told his young victim that he would stab her in the face if she ever told anyone.

But her horrific ordeal was not over. She managed to free herself and tried to flee to the bathroom. But she was caught by 26-year-old Patrick Maughan, another party-goer, and Roderick, who subjected her to another assault.

It was at this point that Roderick rubbed dog shampoo over her own body as she carried out the attack.

The horrifying act lasted less than 10 
seconds but the victim told Reading Crown Court it 
left her feeling physically sick and shattered.

She eventually managed to escape from the house and informed police.

Her attackers were arrested while they were still drunk at the party, which was held at Lawrence's mother's house on April 3 last year.

The court heard how even in police cells Roderick was heard threatening to kill her victim.

Roderick refused to appear before Judge McIntyre to be sentenced today and stayed in the cells beneath the court room.

In her absence, she was jailed indefinitely with a minimum term of four years.

Judge McIntyre said that Roderick posed a 'significant risk of serious harm to the public, including 
children and young persons and that is likely to remain the position 
until she addresses her offending behaviour.'

And he revealed that she had been found guilty of 'similar bullying sexual abuse before'.

'Ms Roderick has chosen not to tell anybody who might have told me what 
has happened in her short life to make her the way she is,' he said.

'However,
in Ms Roderick’s case I am quite satisfied that as a result of these 
offences and her previous convictions for sexual abuse of young boys, 
taken together with her attitude to anybody who challenges her about 
this offending behaviour, that she is dangerous.

Addressing Lawrence, he said: 'It was a prolonged period of time during which she was kept in that house.

'You
did not use a condom. You threatened her afterwards using words to the 
effect that she might get stabbed in the face if she told anybody what 
had happened. You showed no remorse.'

Maughan was jailed for six years while Lawrence, from Reading, was given seven years.

The pair smiled and waved at weeping family members as they were led down to the cells.

Maughan kissed his partner through the glass around the dock as she wailed 'Patrick' before he was taken down.

All three had been found guilty after a trial in December. The verdicts sparked violent scenes in court in which Roderick attacked security guards.

The mother of one of Amber Roderick's previous victims had warned that the teenager would attack again.

Roderick abused two boys, aged nine 
and ten, in Cardiff in 2008 and relatives of the younger victim sat
in the public gallery during today's  sentencing at Reading Crown Court.

Outside court the boy’s
mother told how she had warned probation after the original assault 
that she believed the sexual predator would attack again.

The 
boy’s mother said: 'We are just so happy that she got what she deserved -
I think it’s closure for us but I did think perhaps she would do it 
again.

'It’s been bad. We haven’t been too well over the last couple 
of months now, with it all coming back. I did say to probation it would 
happen again.

'My son is not good. He hasn’t coped with what 
happened. He still does get worried and he doesn’t go out really because
he’s afraid.'

The
distraught mother-of-three recalled how Roderick had led a gang of two 
other girls, both 12 at the time, bullying the young boys in the park 
before kidnapping them.

The youngsters were taken to a wooded area 
where they were beaten, her son had a stick forced down his throat and 
they were then made to perform oral sex on each other.

Roderick, aged
15 at the time, was sent to a young offenders’ institute for two years 
after the attack, despite falling pregnant in the months that followed.

The
boy’s mother even mounted a campaign to stop Roderick being released early
and moving back to Tremorfa, in Cardiff, where the attack took place.

Her calls were successful when the youth was released only after serving the two-year term and did not move back to the area.

Roderick committed the latest offence shortly after being released.
