A four-year-old was diagnosed with leukaemia when her worried mother researched her symptoms on the internet, having been told by a doctor the toddler had an ear infection.

Alia-Grace Birch is now facing two years of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy after tests confirmed she had the blood cancer last month.

Her mother, Michelle, first suspected something was seriously wrong when her daughter kept falling asleep at nursery.

The 23-year-old took her daughter to a local GP, who diagnosed the toddler with a viral infection and sent her home with antibiotics.

After being told her daughter Alia-Grace was suffering a viral infection, Michelle Birch felt it was something more serious and took to Google to research the four-year-old's symptoms

After taking Alia-Grace to A&E, tests revealed the four-year-old had an extremely high white blood cell count, leading doctors to diagnose her with leukaemia

But Ms Birch, from Bentilee in Staffordshire, was convinced there was something more to Alia-Grace's condition, and turned to the internet to research her symptoms.

Days later she rushed her daughter into A&E where tests revealed the four-year-old was suffering an aggressive form of leukaemia.

She was admitted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire before being transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she started chemotherapy.

Ms Birch, who has shaved her head in support of her daughter, said: 'It's horrible, you never expect something like this to happen to your baby girl.

'We're all in this together and we just hope my little girl will get better.

'I took her to the GP because she had been falling asleep at nursery and she said she had earache.

'I kept taking her to the doctors who gave her antibiotics as they thought it was a viral thing.

'I went onto the internet and put her symptoms into Google and a number of medical websites suggested it could be cancer.

'Then when she fell asleep at nursery again, I knew I had to bring her to the hospital - but you still don't expect to be told your baby has cancer.

'It still feels like a dream but, if I am strong, then Alia is strong. I didn't want her to feel left out, or feel like the only person, so I shaved my hair.

'I don't think she fully understands. She knows she's poorly but not how serious it is.

'She was always having bruises and wasn't herself.'

Alia-Grace first fell ill at the beginning of July, suffering an ear and throat infection.

Blood cancer is an umbrella term for cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow and lymphatic system.

The diseases can be life-threatening, partly because they stop the immune system working properly.

When a person's immune system is badly damaged, they can die from an infection their body could normally fight off.

Every 20 minutes, someone in the UK is told they have a blood cancer - that is 70 people a day, or 25,000 people a year.

Many more live with debilitating – and sometimes life-threatening – blood disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia.

Two weeks later, on July 15, Ms Birch took the four-year-old to hospital where tests revealed an extremely high white blood cell count and she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

The next day, she was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she was given steroids, antibiotics and started chemotherapy.

Alia-Grace has now been allowed home but she needs drugs every day and a lumbar puncture - where a needle is injected into her spine - once a week.

Alia's grandmother Joanne Horton-Birch, 42, said: 'At first she wasn't happy when we said she's going to lose her hair, because it was really long and she thought she was Rapunzel.

'Bits had been coming out, then the day it all came out in a big clump she looked in a mirror and said, 'it's okay, it will grow back'.

'If it hadn't been for Alia, how she's coped, I think we would all be in bits.

'Seeing how strong she is with everything she's going through, she still smiles. She makes us strong.

'Getting the diagnosis was devastating. Michelle had been putting the symptoms into the internet, as a lot of parents do, and that was one thing that came up.

'I told her to shut up, it's not going to be that. It's going to be a viral infection as the doctor thought, or she's anaemic. So we were all devastated.

'Usually when children are diagnosed with leukaemia, they do a lumbar puncture to confirm it.

'Alia's white blood count should be between eight and 10 but it was 300 so they knew straight away.

'It was fortunate Michelle took her to hospital when she did because it meant they could start treatment straight away. We are keeping positive for Alia's sake.'
