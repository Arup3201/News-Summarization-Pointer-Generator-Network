Tempers flared this morning at the Tampa funeral of Phoebe Jonchuck, the five-year-old girl thrown to her death from a Florida bridge by her father last week.

While Pastor Bren Byerman preached forgiveness, some of the 100 or so mourners at the Lake Magdeline United Methodist Church struggled to keep their anger towards John Jonchuck in check.

It was too much for one man who was asked to leave the 10am service when he interrupted, shouting out angrily and threatening Jonchuck, who is in police custody.

Despite the understandable emotion, Phoebe's mother insisted mourners wear bright and vivid rainbow colors to the funeral and Pastor Byerman pleaded for her friends and family to forgive Jonchuck. 

The tiny casket for the little girl was decked in pink tulle and flowers and her favorite baby toy doll and her most treasured stuffed animal were put inside.

Phoebe's mother, Michelle Kerr, wore a multi-colored maxi dress and was clearly overcome with the emotion of the sad occasion.

Her grandmother, Michelle Jonchuck, who has said she wished her son killed himself instead of Phoebe said of her 'angel princess' - 'Every time I see a rainbow, I will think of you'.

'I love you. You are so sweet,' she said according to WFLA. 'You made Maw Maw's life complete'

Pastor Byerman addressed the question no one can answer - just why her 25-year-old father would throw his daughter 62-feet to her death from the Dick Misener Bridge in St. Petersburg? She was found dead around a mile downstream one hour after.

While he remains arrested and jailed on a first-degree murder charge, Byerman said, 'When we try and wrestle with the whys, some people will say maybe it was God's will. At this time I can't believe quite that,' he said according to the Tampa Bay Tribune.

'There needs to be a lot of forgiveness here today.

'Not only forgiveness for the person who took Phoebe's life, but also for ourselves.'

In a touching gesture, in the middle of the funeral the congregation blew out a kiss when they heard Phoebe's name.

The mourners sang 'You are My Sunshine' and 'Jesus Loves me' while after the service her grandmother spoke to reporters holding her other favorite toy doll, Lucy.

'She loved rainbows and butterflies, puppies and cats,' said Michele Jonchuck.

'She was happy and always wanted to be a dancer. She loved arts and crafts. There aren't enough words to describe how this child brought so much happiness to people.'

Asked to talk about her son, Michelle said that she fears her son will never be able to explain what he did.

Fury: Phoebe's grandmother, Michelle Jonchuck said last week that she wished her son had killed himself instead of his little girl

'The child loved her daddy,' she said. 'And her daddy was never mean to her. He adored her. Why he did it is a question that maybe one day will be answered, or it never will.'

'Obviously, there was something that snapped,' she added according to People.

'I have to forgive him, because I'll never go to heaven if I don't forgive him. I'm not happy with him. Everybody has to forgive each other's trespasses. I never imagined that this would happen.'

The Blount & Curry Funeral Home in Carrollwood covered the costs of the funeral and Phoebe was buried soon after.

'Phoebe did have a good life,' said Michelle. 'She's an angel up there, and she'll never leave us.'
