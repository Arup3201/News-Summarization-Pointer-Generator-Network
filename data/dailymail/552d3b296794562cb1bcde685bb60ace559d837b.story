Doctors at a major hospital in Boston have become the first in America to use Google Glass for everyday medical care despite privacy fears about the device.

Medics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre are using the controversial eyewear to keep their hands free, which they see as the ‘holy grail’ of hospital technology.

Doctors are looking up patients’ records on Google Glass and checking things online whilst they walk around rather than wading through big files.

Dr Steven Horng, at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, poses for a portrait wearing Google Glass by the QR code that he and other doctors will use to read patient records

They have also put codes on the doors to patients’ rooms so that they can instantly access a patient’s medical records.

Beth Israel says that it is using the most modern technology to help patients - but privacy campaigners have long said Google Glass is invasive.

The hospital has also not outlined how it will seek permission of patients to be filmed by the device’s in-built camera.

Google Glass, which costs $1,500 a pair (£980), is currently on limited release to a few thousand people but will be more widely available later this year.

Google Glass is being used at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre:

- look up patient’s file on the spot without thumbing through a big file

- allow them to stay with a patient for longer

- access patient’s files through QR codes on the patient’s doors

- keeps doctor’s hands free to interact with patientIn the future Google Glass could allow:

- surgeons to watch colleagues operating in real time

- doctors making the rounds remotely whilst a robot with a camera and a monitor showing their image visits them in person

- patients to remotely show their doctors their injuries via the Google Glass camera

It is connected to the Internet via wi-fi and has a tiny screen that lets the user see text and images in front of their eye.

Beth Israel has rolled it out in its entire emergency department and and doctors including Steven Horng say it is helping them to do their jobs.

He told the Boston Globe: 'We’re doing this to prove that the technology can work and really motivate others to explore this space with us.

'Not only is it hands free, it’s always on, always in front of you and always giving you information.

‘Rather than having to excuse myself, it means I can quickly access that information without having to interrupt the patient, lose eye contact, or even leave the room’.

Dr Horng said that in January he thinks that Google Glass may have helped to save a patient’s life.

The man had bleeding in the brain and needed drugs to stop the hemorrhage but he was allergic to a certain kind.

Dr Horng was able to look up the medical files on his eyewear rather than taking vital seconds out to search through his paper files.

Beth Israel is also experimenting with QR (Quick Response) codes on the doors to patient’s rooms which doctors scan with the camera on Google Glass to bring up the records.

Each code is unique to the patient, though it is not clear if anyone can access them if they have a scanner.

Beth Israel is not the first hospital to use Google Glass and surgeons at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis have used to in an operation to cut out an abdominal tumor.

The surgeon was able to call up MRI scans without having to put his instruments down.

At the University of California-Irvine Medical Center, senior doctors are also monitoring junior medics as they make their rounds.

Outside of the medical profession, Google Glass is being used by Virgin Atlantic flight crew to check in passengers on trans-Atlantic trips.

But there has also been controversy and some cafes in America have banned the eyewear out of concerns for privacy.

Google Glass users Cecilia Abadie was also given a driving ticket in California for using Google Glass behind the wheel, though the case was later dropped.
