Crystal Palace have announced the signing of striker Fraizer Campbell from Cardiff.

Campbell has joined for an undisclosed fee, putting pen-to-paper on a three-year deal with the London club.

The 26-year-old, who came through the youth ranks at Manchester United at the start of his career, won the solitary senior England cap he has to his name in 2012.

Campbell made his professional debut with Belgian side Royal Antwerp while on loan for the 2006/07 season from United.

That stint was a success, as was a spell with Hull the following term, and he subsequently spent time on loan with Tottenham before departing United - for whom he had made a total of just four appearances - to join Sunderland in 2009.

In January 2013 he switched to Cardiff and helped them win the Championship title that season - one in which Palace were also promoted, via the play-offs.

But he could not prevent the Welsh outfit from making a swift return to the second tier, with them finishing bottom of the Barclays Premier League in 2013/14.

He arrives at Palace, who came 11th last term, having netted 16 goals in 52 appearances in all competitions for the Bluebirds.
