Child sex offenders who attempt to change their name without receiving permission from authorities could face up to five years in prison under a new crackdown on child protection laws.

The new amendments would see a significant increase to the existing penalty for such an offence, which is currently only a $550 fine.

New regulations suggested for the Child Protection Bill, introduced by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services Stuart Ayres, would see the fine increased to $55,000 and include a jail term.

Convicted pedophiles who change their name without permission could face up to five years in prison and a $55,000 fine

The changes come two years after the death of high-profile child sex offender Dennis Ferguson, who was twice caught using a different unregistered name while working for charities including the RSPCA and Diabetes Australia.

The suggested changes to the Child Protection Bill, come as part of a crackdown on child protection laws introduced by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Stuart Ayres, on Wednesday

An individual on the child protection register must also now report 'details of any motor vehicle hired' and 'details of any telecommunications service' including registering their mobile and land-line phone numbers with police, under the new Bill.

It clarifies the type of contact with someone under the age of 18 that the individual must register, which includes any type of supervision or care of a child, visiting or staying in a house where there is a child present and exchanging contact details with a child.

The use of electronics, including emails and internet communications have also been covered in the Bill.

Alongside convicted pedophiles, individuals who qualify for registration on the child protection register has also been amended to include those responsible for manslaughter of a child, child abduction and anyone responsible for 'wounding' or causing 'grievous bodily harm of a child under 10 years of age'.

The announcement was met with public scrutiny however, after a spokesperson for Mr Ayres told The Sydney Morning Herald that parents and carers convicted of 'shaking' a child, would fall under this category.

Sue Foley, a expert on shaken baby syndrome said registering carers for shaking a child would be 'over the top', and that educating them on coping with stressful situations would be more effective.

However in his introductory speech of the Bill, Mr Ayres clarified that: ''Inclusion of these offences will ensure that offenders who may continue to pose significant risk to children are not omitted from ongoing monitoring'.
