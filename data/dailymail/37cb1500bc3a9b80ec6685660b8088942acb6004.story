A pilot whose plane mysteriously crashed in Taylor Swift's home city named the pop star as his next-of-kin, it has emerged.

Michael Callan was killed at Nashville Airport, Tennessee, 500 miles from the supposed destination of his single-engine Cessna - which he said would make a simple 37-mile hop without leaving Canada.

With countless questions unanswered about his death, a new one has crowned them all: he named Taylor Swift as his closest relation.

Mystery: Taylor Swift performing in Nashville in June. Her publicist said she had never heard of the tragic pilot

Bizarre: A map showing Michael Callan's supposed flight plan. Instead he crashed in Taylor Swift's home city

The bizarre twist was uncovered by daily newspaper The Tennessean and was confirmed by the 23-year-old singer's publicist Paula Erickson.

She told the newspaper: 'The first we heard of this was when the appropriate authorities contacted Taylorâ€™s management about the crash. Taylor does not know this person.'

Singer: Taylor, who moved to Nashville aged 14, has had a string of number ones and eligible boyfriends

The 'aspiring pilot who loved to fly', as described by his family, was unmarried and had no children.

His sister, Jody Quenneville, told reporters they were in a state of shock and had no idea how he ended up in Nashville.

The wreckage of Mr Callan's plane lay 
undiscovered on the runway at Nashville Airport for up to seven hours 
after it crashed in the early hours of October 29.

Investigators
revealed it had originated 500 miles away at the Windsor Flying 
Club in Ontario, Canada - and was listed as making a 37-mile journey to 
Pelee Island Airport.

But 
at some point after setting off after 8pm on October 28, Mr Callan diverted 
from his flight plan without informing air traffic controllers of a change, and his transponder was switched off.

He
may have circled Nashville Airport for more than two hours before 
crash-landing in thick fog, where his plane skidded for about 450 
feet before bursting into flames.

The
engine was found 700 feet from the point where the plane hit the 
runway, and the propeller - which showed signs of having hit the runway -
was 400 feet away.

The alarm was only raised after another pilot saw the wreckage at 8.45am.

Air safety investigators have released
an initial report and will now be examining air traffic control tapes 
and the pilot's experience.

Star: The wide appeal of Taylor Swift's songs has been put down to her raw, emotional lyrics

The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are both probing the incident.

No one has been able to explain why superstar Taylor Swift - who moved to Nashville aged 14 to pursue a country music career - was given a mention by Callan.

Now 23, Taylor has had a string of number one hits and has dated some of the world's biggest stars including Jonas brother Joe Jonas, One Direction's Harry Styles and the actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

In a recent interview with New York Magazine she discussed the wide appeal of her raw, emotional lyrics, revealing that 'things are not okay all the time.'

She said: 'Allowing yourself to feel raw, real emotions in public is something I am never going to be afraid to do.'
