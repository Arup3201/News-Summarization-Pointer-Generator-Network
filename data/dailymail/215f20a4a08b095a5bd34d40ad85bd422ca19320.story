Jamie Carragher spent 17 years at Liverpool, setting a European appearance record in the process and eventually racked up 737 games for the club.

He can therefore probably be forgiven for seeing Melwood as a home from home.

On Friday the Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender turned up at his old training base instead of heading to the gym.

Carragher tweeted: 'Anyone ever drive to there previous employment without thinking? I've just drove to Melwood! Supposed to be going the gym!!'

The 36-year-old hung up his boots 18 months ago but former Liverpool midfielder Jimmy Case believes the club would have won the title last season were Carragher still around.

Case said: 'If Carragher had stayed on for one more season, Liverpool would have won it. He would not have played every game, but the way they lost it against Chelsea and Crystal Palace would not have happened.'

The likes of Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Mario Balotelli could have been at Melwood when Carragher arrived, with Brendan Rodgers preparing his players who aren't on international duty for their next Premier League fixture.
