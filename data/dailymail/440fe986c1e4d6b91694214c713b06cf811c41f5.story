Two suicide bombers who blew up their cars outside an orphanage as they tried to hit an Iranian cultural center killed at least four people and wounded more than a hundred.

The pair attacked a Shiite district in southern Beirut, according to Lebanese officials and an al-Qaida linked group that claimed responsibility for the devastating attack.

The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said it had carried out the simultaneous bombings as retaliation for the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian war alongside President Bashar Assad's forces.

The radical Lebanese group Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which claimed the attack on its Twitter account, also said it was responsible for a November 19 attack on the Iranian embassy that killed 23 people, using the same tactic of twin suicide bombs.

In both cases, most of the victims were civilians.

Hezbollah is a powerful Shi'ite Muslim political and militant group in Lebanon that is funded by Iran.

The group has sent hundreds of fighters to neighbouring Syria, giving a boost to its ally President Bashar al-Assad against mainly Sunni rebels seeking to topple him.

'We will continue - through the grace of 
God and his strength - to target Iran and its party in Lebanon 
(Hezbollah) in all of their security, political and military centres to 
achieve our two demands: One, the exit of all fighters from the Party of
 Iran in Syria. Two, the release of all our prisoners from oppressive 
Lebanese prisons,' the statement said.

Fire engines and ambulances rushed to the area and were seen evacuating some of the wounded - including children - on stretchers

It was the latest in a string of deadly bombings targeting Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon.

The group is a staunch ally of Assad's
 government and its fighters have been instrumental in helping dislodge 
Syrian rebels from key areas near the border with Lebanon.

The morning blasts in the Bir Hassan district set cars and trees ablaze and shattered the windows of nearby buildings.

Fire
 engines and ambulances rushed to the area and were seen evacuating some
 of the wounded - including children - on stretchers.

Rahmeh Abboud, a 20-year-old student, said she was in a passenger van when she heard the explosions. The driver immediately stopped the car and told everybody to get out.

'The explosions were very strong, the ground shook. I came here and it was like the world had turned upside down,' she said.

The Lebanese army said the attack was carried out by suicide bombers driving BMW and Mercedes cars.Â 

Health Minister Wael Abu Faour said four people were killed and more than 100 wounded by the blasts.

The
 explosions went off near Iran's cultural center and the Kuwaiti 
Embassy. Blast walls were set up in front of the Iranian cultural center
 recently for fear of such attacks. The white building suffered serious 
damage from the outside.

The state-run National News Agency quoted the Iranian embassy as saying that there were no serious injuries among diplomats and workers there.

The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said on its Twitter account that the 'invasion of the Iranian cultural center' was in 'retaliation for Iran's party fighting along the criminal regime in Syria.'

It was referring to Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group.

'We will continue to target Iran and its party in Lebanon through their security, political and military offices until Hezbollah fighters withdraw from Syria and scores of Islamic detainees are released from Lebanese jails'.

The latest attack is linked to the civil war in neighboring Syria that has killed and wounded scores of people over the last few months

It said Hezbollah will not 'enjoy security in Lebanon until the people of Syria feel secure.'

Hezbollah legislator Ali Ammar, speaking from the site of the blasts, said the group 'will not withdraw from a strategic battle that aims to foil plans to divide the region.'

Iran is a major backer of Hezbollah and both are allies of Assad.

The explosions came few days after Prime Minister Tammam Salam formed a new cabinet after almost 11 months of paralysis.

He said today that the attack is 'a message by forces of terrorism to continue in their plan to spread death in Lebanon.'

'We got the message and we will respond to it with solidarity and our commitment to peace,' he said.

The three-year uprising in Syria, which began as popular protests but descended into civil war, has increasingly been taken over by Sunni Islamist groups.

Some rebel groups have affinities or direct links to al Qaeda or militant groups in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Iraq.

The Abdullah Azzam Brigades have strong links to Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps as well as connections with the Gulf.

One of its senior military leaders, Majid bin Muhammad al-Majid, was a Saudi national. He was arrested by Lebanese authorities last December, who said he died from kidney failure while in their custody.
