The family of a father-of-three who suddenly died of a heart attack on Monday have blamed the Seattle Seahawk's disastrous last minute Super Bowl play in his obituary. 

The tribute to Michael Vedvik, 53, from Spokane, Washington, appeared in the Spokesman-Review on Thursday - the last line of which read: 'We blame the Seahawks lousy play call for Mike's untimely death.'

It refers to Pete Carroll's decision to have quarterback Russel Wilson throw the ball rather than hand it to star running back Marshawn Lynch in the dying moments of the Super Bowl.

The play was intercepted by the New England Patriot's Malcolm Butler - prompting some fans, analysts and former players to brand it the worst  call in NFL history.

Mr Vedvik's widow, Stephanie, told the paper her husband, a small business owner, didn't actually watch the game on Sunday. 

He wasn't feeling well so taped the encounter and planned to watch it the next day, but he was found dead in the morning. 

His brother-in-law added the line about Seattle's unsuccessful final play to the obituary and she approved. 

Response: Mr Vedvik's widow, Stephanie, told the paper her husband, a small business owner, didn't actually watch the game on Sunday and insisted he would have found the line 'hysterical'

She said: 'He hadn’t been feeling well on and off, but he wouldn’t go to the doctor. He thought it was indigestion or stress.'

'My husband would have thought it was hysterical. If I had read this obituary to my husband about somebody else, he would have had a laugh.

'It was just so true because my husband would have said, "What a dumbass."' 

Mike Vedvik's funeral will be Saturday at Mount Spokane Church in Mead, Washington.
