This is the latest young woman to flee the UK in a bid to reach the terrorist group Islamic State.

Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara.

They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria.

Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group

The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.

Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings.

One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. 

Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest. 

A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her. 

'Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' 

Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities.

They said messages and images on her mobile phone indicated she was planning to head to Islamic State territory.

The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of government rules against speaking to the media without prior authorization. 

A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm the detention of a British national in Ankara and are providing consular assistance.' 

The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. 

The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. 

They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists.

This is the moment two 'naive and impressionable' teenage cousins who dreamed of careers in medicine and engineering were stopped in Turkey by immigration officers at border control as they tried to flee  to join ISIS on Saturday

Last month three British girls – Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 – travelled to Turkey. 

They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December.

There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. 

Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. 

Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State.

It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place.

Yesterday a High Court judge took the unprecedented step of making a 16-year-old boy a ward of court in a bid to stop him travelling to Syria.

The boy, who cannot be named because of a gagging order imposed by the court, is a member of a family steeped in militant Islam. He has dual Libyan and British citizenship.

Two older brothers have been killed fighting in Syria and a third continues to fight despite being injured. An uncle was held in Guantanamo Bay.

Mr Justice Hayden said he was concerned to 'keep this lad alive' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate.

He said he was a vulnerable young person who had grown up in a family 'where the male members are patently committed to waging jihad in war-torn Syria'. The decision was made in the Family Division of the High Court after an application by social services at Brighton and Hove City Council.
