While most people are content to cuddle up next to a cat or a dog, Katie Dunsmore only has eyes for her four woolly friends.

But the model and actress is no farmer, her flock - Tilly, Rosemary, Ethel and Pearl - are strictly pets and she says she would never dream of using them for meat or anything else.

Her four farmyard friends - who she calls 'my babies' - enjoy nothing more than following her about just like the character from the nursery rhyme and snacking on their favourite treats, jelly babies, from out of her hand.

Friends: Shepherd Katie Dunsmore says she would never use Tilly, Rosemary, Ethel or Pearl for meat

She has even trained her beloved sheep to play football with her on the rolling fields near her home in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire.

She said: 'My friends all think I’m crazy for having four pet sheep - I’m a girlie girl and I’m not really the kind of person you would expect to enjoy mucking out in the fields with a bunch of sheep but I love it.

'My dad calls me Little Bo Peep but I don’t mind. My sheep are my best friends and I wouldn’t trade them for the world.'

Devoted Miss Dunsmore, 20, said the idea to buy the sheep earlier this year came about from a chat with her father Stuart, 65, a former farmer.

Pampered: Miss Dunsmore has owned the four Texel sheep since January and has spent £1,800 on them

The pair, who until January had been living together happily in the town of Messingham with their just their two Persian housecats for company, decided something was missing from their lives.

She said: 'He had been talking about how he worked on a farm when he was a little boy and loved hanging about the sheep and I suggested we should get some.

'When he agreed, I at first thought he was joking - I didn’t know the first thing about keeping sheep. But then we just thought it would be great to do something completely different.

'Everyone has cats and dogs and gerbils, but I don’t know anyone else who has four pet sheep.

'The more we talked about it the more I realised it would be a fun thing to do so we rented a piece of land and got four Texel cross sheep from a farmer in January.'

Miss Dunsmore has since spent nearly £1,800 on the sheep, including £450 for a shed and £700 for the annual land fees.

Baarmy: The four sheep have become quite tame and enjoy snaffling jelly babies out of Miss Dunsmore's hands

She said: 'At first we thought they were all female so I gave them all old lady names, but then I later found out they are actually all male.

'I kept the names because I thought they suited them, especially Pearl who has a big tuft of curly white hair on the top of her head like a little old lady.'

Looking after the sheep is a lot of hard work so every day Miss Dunsmore can be found in the field, mucking them out and feeding them.

Once the hard work is over however, she is then free to enjoy the company of her bleating babies.

She said: 'They are a lot of work but they are more fun to look after than a guinea pig or a goldfish in a bowl.

'I love just sitting there and watching the world go by with my sheep. They are getting really tame now and will follow me all over the field.

'One day I brought a football with me for them to play with and now they love to have a little kickabout.

'They can get quite boisterous, especially when they know I have jelly babies on me and they come up and snaffle them out of my hand.

'Ethel is the brave one, she loves being stroked and will jump up if I have treats. Tilly was really timid to begin with but has really come out of her shell now.

'Rosemary is the rowdy one and will push the others out of the way to get to the food and Pearl, who is named after my nana, is the shy one. She prefers to be on her own.'

Miss Dunsmore admits the sheep are number one in her life and even her boyfriend Michael Lewis, 36, is forced to get stuck in with the cleaning and care of her unusual pets.

She said: 'I think people probably think I’m a bit mad when they first meet me and find out about my sheep and maybe I am.

'I put some photos of them on my Facebook and my friends couldn’t believe I’d gone out and bought four sheep to take care of but they are coming round to the idea now.

'I can’t imagine life without them, they are my babies.'
