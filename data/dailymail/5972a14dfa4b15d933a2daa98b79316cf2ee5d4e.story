Bryan Ruiz promised no change in Costa Rica’s adventurous spirit when they and Greece contest the status of underdogs tomorrow in rain-soaked Recife.

Having helped dispose of England and Italy, the Central Americans are confident of more success as they and the Greeks both target their first World Cup quarter-final.

‘In many countries they thought we were only here to participate and not compete,’ said Ruiz.

‘It is a dream come true to be in this round. It is going crazy back home in Costa Rica.

‘We’ve been working really hard. We have a philosophy about how we play and we’re going to die with it, because it’s working.

‘Our opponents from now on will have more of an idea about how to play against us. They can study us and what we did in the group games. This next round is going to be very tough.’

Greece will not need to study too hard on Joel Campbell. Arsenal’s Costa Rican striker spent last season on loan at Greek champions Olympiacos.

‘I don’t think I’ll be giving him a call,’ said Greece midfielder Andreas Samaris, one of four Olympiacos players in the squad.

‘But if I did I would wish him the best of  luck and tell him his team is going to lose the game.’
