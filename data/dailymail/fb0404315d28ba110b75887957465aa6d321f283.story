It felt like the end of an era as Thibaut Courtois waited for fans behind his goal to return the ball, and they started to sing his name: ‘T-Bo, T-Bo.’ The king is dead, long live the king.

Petr Cech, Chelsea’s undisputed No 1 for a decade, sat among the substitutes, naked without his protective headgear.

Jose Mourinho has tried to dance around this subject for most of the summer, but his final decision is looming large and the selection of Courtois against Real Sociedad suggests he will go with the younger man at Burnley on Monday.

Big decision: Jose Mourinho will have to decide which man to select for their Premier League season opener

Mourinho did not attempt to fudge the issue by giving the two keepers half a game each. Courtois came out for the second half, too.

Courtois did not have lots to do but did what was required with polish. He made no fuss over routine saves, was a quick from his penalty box when necessary and his handling was clean.

If there is one doubt about the Belgian, it is how he will cope with the extra physical attention and aerial attack in England.

If there are no problems, Big Pete could soon be on his way. If so, he deserves a farewell fit for a hero.
