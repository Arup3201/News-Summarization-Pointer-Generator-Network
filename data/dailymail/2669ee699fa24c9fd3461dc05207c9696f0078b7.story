The search for a 14-year-old Colorado girl is becoming increasingly desperate as her disappearance enters its second week.

Alexandra 'Ali' Ponte was last seen on September 4 when she left her home after a fight with her mother, Christina Duis.

The teen had posted an unflattering self-penned rap song about her mother and her step-father on Facebook, and Duis banned her from the social networking site.

Missing teen: Fears for the safety of 14-year-old Ali Ponte, who has now been missing for eight days, are growing

'It wasn't a very nice rap. It was about her stepfather and me,' Duis told ABC News. 'The gist of it was she feels unloved, and she's angry and hurt.'

Following the argument, Ponte left the house and was given a lift to Memorial Park in Woodland Park, Colorado, by a friend's mother.

According to ABC News, Ponte told the mom that she was meeting up with another friend at the park, and would be sleeping the night at the friend's home.

But when Ponte's mother called to check up on her daughter, she discovered that she had never had any plans to sleep over at her friend's home that night.

Two men told police they saw Ponte walking along Baldwin Street behind the local high school at about 9:10pm that night. After that, the teen disappeared, and there are grave concerns for her safety.

Investigators fear the teen may have been kidnapped after running away from home.

'There are no words. My heart is just breaking,' Duis told ABC News through tears.

'We just want her to know that she's not in trouble. We just want her to
come home,' she said.

A Facebook page, Help Find Ali Ponte aka Alexandra Renee Ponte, has been set up to help find the girl.

'It's devastating to think you could lose a
child. So I have to hold on to hope that she's still alive and she's 
still going to come home,' said Ponte's mother.

Ponte is described as being white, 115lbs and five feet five inches tall. She was wearing jeans and a bright blue hooded sweatshirt and had her brown hair in a ponytail. She was carrying a gray-and-black Nike backpack.

The FBI has been helping local police with their investigations by tracking Ponte's cell phone signals, but had difficulty getting a reading, and now according to ABC News, the phone has gone dead.

Volunteers are planning to meet this Saturday at Woodland Park High School to continue the search.

'I just wish I would have hugged her more. I just wish I would have told her how much I love her more. I don't think she really knows,' Duis told ABC News.

Detective Sean Goings told KRDO that police are investigating a tip from a friend of Ponte's who said she was seen in Ellicott.

Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Alexandra Ponte is urged to call Detective Sean Goings on 719-687-9262.
