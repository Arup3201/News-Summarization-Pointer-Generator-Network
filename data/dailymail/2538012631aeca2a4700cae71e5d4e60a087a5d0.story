One of the last iconic remnants of 'old' Heathrow is being demolished this week.

The distinctive nine-floor red brick old control tower is being pulled down as part of the airport's transformation.

It is being removed to make way for roads which will serve the new Terminal 2.

Served its time: The original control tower at Heathrow is pulled down

End of an era: The demolition of the distinctive nine-floor red brick old control tower is the latest phase of the £2.5billion refurbishment 
of Terminal 2

The iconic structure, with its instantly recognisable glazed Air Traffic Control Room and white radar dome, has stood over the ever-evolving airport since 1955.

It replaced the RAF Control Tower shortly after the first modern runway and terminal building were opened by Queen Elizabeth.

Designed by architect Sir Frederick Gibberd, who was responsible for the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral and Didcot Power Station, the Old Control Tower closed last year after almost 60 years service.

It was home to offices for the last five years of its life after Air Traffic Control moved to the new control tower in 2007.

The £50million, 87-metre high tower 
was opened by then Secretary of State for Transport Douglas Alexander 
and is the tallest air traffic control tower in the UK.

Then and now: The old control tower was built in 1955, left, and was home to Air Traffic Control until 2007

After the tower is cleared the only original Central Terminal Area building that will remain will be the Boiler House.

An airport spokesperson said: 'The OCT has witnessed Heathrow's transformation from humble beginnings to what we are now.

'The arrival of the new Terminal 2 is just the latest phase of our ongoing transformation.'

The tower was built in the same era as the Queens Building and Europa Building, which have both also been demolished.

Distinctive: The Old Control Tower was well known for its red brick facade, glazed Air Traffic Control Room and white radar dome

Historic: Following the demolition of the Old Control Tower, only one original Central Terminal Area building will remain

Pre-1950s, early passenger terminals were ex-military marquees that formed a row of tents along Bath Road.

The
 new Terminal 2, which is the latest phase of an £11billion 
refurbishment programme at Heathrow, will be home to Virgin Atlantic 
domestic routes and STAR Alliance and Aer Lingus flights when it opens 
in 2014.

The 
£2.5billion development of the a new main terminal building, satellite 
building and aircraft parking stands is the largest privately-funded 
construction prokect in the UK.

The airport expects 20 million passengers a year to eventually use the new terminal.
