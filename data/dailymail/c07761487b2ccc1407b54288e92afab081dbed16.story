A New York photographer has created a fascinating image that reveals the sheer volume of air traffic at one of the city’s airports.

Paul Ker’s composite photo shows every plane landing at LaGuardia Airport on a recent summer day between 1pm and 2pm.

With nearly 40 passenger jets in the image, that amounts to one landing roughly every 90 seconds.

Cleared for landing: Photographer Paul Ker snapped a photo of every plane landing at LaGuardia Airport

Mr Ker's striking image makes it look like the planes are flying together in unison – like a fleet of alien spacecraft going in for the attack – but they were snapped individually as they approached the airport at low altitude.

He photographed the commercial aircraft from his home in Woodside, Queens, where he is used to the sound of rumbling planes.

Mr Ker told Gothamist: ‘It gets quite loud when we’re out on our terrace, but not nearly as loud as when they take off in this direction. That gets really bad.’ 

In terms of passenger traffic, LaGuardia is the third busiest of the New York area’s three major airports.

More than 23 million travellers passed through the airport in 2013, an increase of 6.6 per cent from 2012.
