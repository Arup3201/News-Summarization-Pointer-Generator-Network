Three teenage boys and a sheriff from Elmore County, Alabama, have died after being involved in a 'freak' car accident. 

Austin Ray Augustine of Wetumpka, was driving three fellow 16 year olds in a 2003 Infiniti G35 sports sedan when he collided into deputy James Bart Hart's patrol car on Sunday night.

Both drivers sustained fatal injuries, as did two of the passengers in Augustine's car: Dylan Adler Bieber and Hoyt Elliot Hardin, also of Wetumpka. 

The sole survivor, Nicholas Benjamin, 16, of Eclectic, was helicoptered to hospital with what appeared to be life-threatening injuries.

The incident took place at around 7:45pm Sunday on Firetower Road - a rural two-lane stretch about 15 miles north of Montgomery, Alabama. 

Benjamin and Hart, 50, were wearing seatbelts but the others were not, authorities said.

Hart, a married father-of-one, was on duty and had just left the scene of an accident involving a deer. He was the sole occupant of his Dodge Charger patrol car.

Elmore County superintendent Jeff Langham described the incident as an 'unimaginable tragedy.'

The Wetumpka High School gym - where the teenagers were enrolled - will be used as a gathering place for friends and families to spend time together Monday night.

Ministers, school counselors, teachers and other school and community personnel will be on hand..

'There are no words to describe this devastating loss here in our community,' Langham said.

He added that Hart  is the first officer killed  in the line of duty in at least 24 years. 

He joined the sheriff's office two-and-a-half years ago after retiring from the Montgomery Fire Department.

He is survived by his wife and daughter.
