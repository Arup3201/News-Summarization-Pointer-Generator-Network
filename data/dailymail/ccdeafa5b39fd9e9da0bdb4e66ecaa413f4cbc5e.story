Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has slammed the club for a lack of ambition under the tenure of owner Mike Ashley.

The Magpies are 11th in the Premier League table having escaped with a 1-0 win over relegation threatened Aston Villa on Saturday.

Shearer, who scored over 200 goals for Newcastle, believes the St James' Park faithful will consider giving up their season tickets soon because of the lack of investment and hope. 

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was among the crowd of spectators at St James' Park on Saturday

'There is no excitement, no anticipation. It takes its toll, even on the most loyal fans in the country. Fans want to dream their team can be successful, whether that's in a domestic cup competition or in Europe,' Shearer told the Telegraph.

'Newcastle fans at the minute are showing why they are some of the best around, because they can't dream. They've been told the cups aren't a priority, that finishing 10th in the Premier League is more important.'

The former striker calls for squad investment in the summer but doubts much will change under current owner Mike Ashley, and insists the club should pursue Cup glory more seriously.

'Unless the club are going to bring in a load of exciting players in the summer, which is highly unlikely when you look at the way it's been run, then I think people might look at giving up. I can only tell you what my mates are thinking about doing because of the lack of hope at the minute,' added Shearer

'I'd dearly love us to have a cup run, I'd dearly love us to get to Wembley again, I'd much rather that than just finish in mid-table year after year.

'It's not going to happen because we've played a weakened team in every cup game. They've been playing weakened teams in cup competitions since 2007.'
