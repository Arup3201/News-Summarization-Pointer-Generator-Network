General Sir Miles Dempsey GBE, KCB, DSO, MC commanded the 2nd Army and ordered the account to be written shortly after the events that would change the course of the war

A 'secret' book recording the precise details about the D-Day
landings has been discovered locked in a safe.

General Sir Miles Dempsey GBE, KCB, DSO, MC commanded the 2nd
Army and ordered the account to be written shortly after the events that would change the course of the war.

Only 48 copies of the three-volume book, An Account Of The Operations Of Second Army In Europe 1944-45, were ever published, soon after the war - and are all held in museums or military
institutions.

Much of the material provided the world with information about the army's actions from
before D-Day to Berlin.

The book that has now emerged was war legend Gen Dempsey's own
copy.

After his death aged 72 in 1969, the book was passed down to
his great nephew James Dempsey.

He put the volumes in a friend's safe over 20 years ago and
forgot about them.

He assumed they were lost for ever, but on the friend's death
last year, the safe was opened and they were returned.

They are now expected to fetch £6,000 when they go under
the hammer at auction at Bonhams of London.

A modest man, Sir Miles was one of the most 
important wartime generals but is almost completely unknown because of 
his determination to stay
out of the limelight.

He went from Major to full General in charge of half a million
troops in just six years, and was the first person since Agincourt to be
knighted on the battlefield by the king himself.

He insisted that the account was written shortly after the war
while events were still fresh in the memory.

He put his chief of staff, General Pete Pyman, in charge and
the completed work was never meant for public consumption.

Because Gen Dempsey never wrote his own memoirs and in his will
requested that his diaries were burned, this account is his testament.

Peter Rostron, who has written the only biography about Sir
Miles, said information about him was hard to come by.

He said: 'This is a unique volume that was once the personal
property of an extraordinary military man.

'It is a tribute to the men he commanded so successfully.'

Mr Rostron said Gen Dempsey was an infantry soldier in World
War One, served on the front line for several years and was gassed and received
the Military Cross.

He said: 'He commanded a brigade in the British Expeditionary
Force in 1940 then masterminded the invasion of Italy and gained extensive
experience of amphibious ops.

'He put this to great use in planning the D-Day landings and
his two British and Canadian corps achieved greater success in the landings
than their American equivalents.

'He completed a successful campaign with the capture of the
northern ports of Germany in May 1945.

'The reason General Dempsey has not achieved the prominence of
any other commander lies in the fact that he was extremely modest and selfless.

'He would only accept praise and glory for his men and never
for himself.'

His modesty was also in evidence when he refused to take the
surrender of some Germans, telling them to return when Field Marshal Bernard
Montgomery was around.

After the war, he declined to take the position of Chief of the
Imperial General Staff and instead accepted the position of British Commander
in Chief of Middle East Land Forces.

Gen Dempsey retired from the British Army in 1947 and married
the next year. In his retirement he hunted, and bred race horses.

He was Colonel of the Royal Berkshire Regiment from 1947 to
1956, Colonel Commandant of the Corps of Military Police from 1947 to 1957
and Colonel of the 1 SAS from 1951 to 1960.

His great nephew James Dempsey said: 'Miles Dempsey was my
guardian when I was a child and his copy of the account of the second army was
passed down to me.

'Over 20 years ago I asked my father to put the volumes into a
friend's safe and then I completely forgot about them.

'When I remembered them, my father had died and I would
wake up in the night kicking myself that I'd lost them.

'Then last year, the friend who had the safe died and when it
was opened there were the volumes in a parcel with the word "Dempsey" on them.

'It was great to have them back and it is very difficult to
sell them because they are really Miles' testament.'
