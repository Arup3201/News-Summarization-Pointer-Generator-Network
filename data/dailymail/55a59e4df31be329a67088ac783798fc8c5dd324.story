QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has insisted his club can afford not to win promotion to the Premier League, despite debts of £177.1 million.

Rangers face Derby County in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on May 24, with Harry Redknapp's side hoping to secure the £120m pay packet of Premier League promotion.

But, should QPR return to the top tier at the first attempt, they could be forced to pay out more than half of that in fines under the Football League's Financial Fair Play regulations.

Based on last year's accounts, Rangers would have to pay £62.1m if they are promoted because their £65.4m losses were so far in excess of the £8m allowed by the Football League.

Should Redknapp's side stay in the Championship, however, they would be subjected to a transfer embargo.

QPR have tried to reduce their wage bill by selling high-earners such as Christopher Samba and sending the likes of Loic Remy and Adel Taarabt out on loan.

Fernandes told talkSPORT: 'Yes, we can (afford not to go up). I'm an accountant by background - although I may not seem it!

'We've told the fans, whether we go up or we don't, we're here for the long term.

'We know what culture we want at the club and we will continue the journey whether we're in the Championship or the Premier League.

'We are a much smarter, much wiser group of people than we were two years ago.'
