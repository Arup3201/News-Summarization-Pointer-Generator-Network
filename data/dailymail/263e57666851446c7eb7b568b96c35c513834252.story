It's that time of year when many of us realise just how frail our elderly relatives have become - and, in turn, fear for their safety.

Now, a new wristband promises to ease the fears of family members - and gives the wearer more confidence about their wellbeing.

Buddi, as it is known, works as a 24/7 monitoring and personal emergency response service.

It not only tracks the user's whereabouts using GPS, but alerts their next of kin or carers if the person appears to be in trouble. 

The Buddi system not only tracks the user's whereabouts using GPS, but alerts their next of kin or carers if the person appears to be in trouble. It comes in three parts - the wristband, the clip (left, which can be attached to a lanyard or keyring) and the dock (centre). While the waterproof wristband goes everywhere with the user, tracing movement and raising an alert if it detects a fall, the clip remains in the charging dock, plugged in at home, and 'talks' to the wristband

Unlike traditional 'around the neck' alert devices, Buddi works outside the house and even abroad

The aim of the device is to give the wearer independence and both them and their family peace of mind.

And unlike traditional 'around the neck' alert devices, Buddi works outside the house and even abroad. 

It comes in three parts - the wristband, the clip (which can also be attached to a lanyard or keyring) and the dock.

While the waterproof wristband goes everywhere with the user, and and traces movement and raises an alert if it detects a fall, the clip goes in a pocket or handbag and 'talks' to the wristband.

The dock provides accurate indoor location point, charges the devices and communicates wirelessly with them, displaying clip and wristband battery charge levels.

There is also an alert button, allowing the wearer to contact and speak to the 24/7 alarm-monitoring centre in case of an emergency, via a portable clip. 

Safe areas can be created for the wearer which alert carers, friends or family members if broken. 

And unlike many personal alarms which are taken off at night, by wearing the wristband at night - when many falls happen on the way to the bathroom - users are better protected, knowing that a fall will be alerted.

According to research by the Royal Voluntary Service charity, more 20 per cent of people aged over 75 fear falling.

And of these, 5 per cent are so fearful that they will not leave their homes unaccompanied, the report found. 

A third of them had suffered falls in recent years and a fifth of these said they had lost confidence as a result. Many said they were especially worried during winter months.

The aim of the device is to give the wearer independence and both them and their family peace of mind. Assigned relatives can log on and see an activity log, for example 

The wristband goes everywhere with the user. It traces movement and raises an alert if it detects a fall

Every year in the UK nearly three-quarters of a million people aged over 60 end up in the local A&E department after a fall, and one in three of these will end up staying in hospital because of their injuries.

Figures show around a third of adults who are over 65 and living at home will experience at least one fall a year. 

This rises to half of adults over 80 who are either at home or in residential care. In 2009 in England and Wales, there were more than 3,500 deaths as a result of falls. 

With the Buddi wristband, an individual’s personal settings can be configured via the buddi website through a secure user login area. 

If the wearer presses the alert buttons for help, or if the system detects the person has fallen, the 24 hour monitoring service can find information about their location, talk to them through the clip to establish the kind of assistance they require, and notify emergency contacts.

If the wearer cannot be reached - perhaps because they are unconscious or because they can't physically reach the clip - the monitoring team will try to alert other registered emergency contacts. 

Falls are detected  automatically, so even if someone is incapacitated as a result of a fall, the system still works without having to be activated by hand. 

The wristband also monitors activity levels - and with the option of setting expected activity level, flags up if a person is moving more or less than normal

A sensor called an accelerometer inside the wristband measures the changes in movement that result from a fall.

'The idea is that no one need ever be alone,' founder Sara Murray told MailOnline.

'It helps relieve the burden on ordinary families, who are often caught in a balancing act between allowing their parents or grandparents to retain their independence by being on hand, but then losing their own independence in the process.'

Ms Murray, a technology entrepreneur, created Buddi in 2005 after the horror she felt when her young daughter temporarily disappeared at a supermarket.  

She was recently named Most Promising Women Entrepreneur by Fortune Magazine – and Buddi was the only UK-based business on this year’s ten-strong list of companies.  

Ms Murray added: 'At Buddi, we operate a fully staffed emergency monitoring centre in the UK where trained operators are on hand 24/7, 365 days of the year, to react to emergency alerts and inform registered contacts of emergencies so that they can provide assistance.

Just last week, Buddi won a contract to supply an initial 50,000 units to a U.S. company

'The technology used in the new Buddi can also be used to remotely monitor a person's general welfare, enabling care to be delivered to a much larger number of people at no extra cost to the tax-payer.' 

Buddi is currently working with over 100 UK local authorities and NHS Trusts to help protect vulnerable people from harm. 

According to a cost-benefit analysis completed by the economist John Kay, Buddi's technology could save the government £2bn.

This is because its technology, on average, delays the need for residential care – which costs about £60,000 a year for each patient – by about nine months. 

And just last week Buddi won a contract to supply an initial 50,000 units to Intel-GE Care Innovations, a U.S. company which provides technology-based health management solutions for individuals and institutions. 

The deal will see the distribution of the wristband device across America, which will help senior and vulnerable people remain independent for longer, the company says.  

Prices are either £249 to purchase the equipment and £5 a week for 24-7 (for fully staffed emergency support for any alert,) or £10 a week to lease the same service.

Paul Gohla, 93, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, has been wearing the Buddi wrist band for a month now.

Paul Gohla, 93, says the wristband (pictured right) has dramatically improved his confidence 

Having lost his beloved partner Annie, living in a rural area and with the cold weather kicking in, Mr Gohla had lost his confidence somewhat.  

His carer, Sarah Boocock, said: 'The Buddi device has definitely made him more comfortable. The moment he put it on his confidence boomed.

'It has given him a bit of extra security and should he be taken poorly, myself and his next of kin can log on and see exactly where he is. It's reassuring for us, as well.

'It's good because it doesn't just work in the home - he can get out and about. 

'It works really well for him and he really likes it. Before, he was nervous going out in cold, icy weather as we live in a rural area. 

'Now, he's getting on  the bus to Halifax, 20 miles away. It has really opened up his world again and made him more active. 

'If I pop round and he's not in, or I can't find him, then I can log in and see where he is.' 

The device also helped a friend of Mr Gohla's when he was in need. Arriving at her house, he could see she was unwell and so pressed his Buddi.

'After speaking to someone at the call centre, staff there contacted me and I called an ambulance and the friend's daughter. She was very impressed.' 

Mr Gohla told MailOnline: 'It's a very good thing - I feel much safer now.'

Mr Gohla's carer, Sarah Boocock, said the Buddi device was working very well for him. 'Before, he was nervous going out in cold, icy weather as we live in a rural area. Now, he's getting on the bus to Halifax, 20 miles away. It has really opened up his world again and made him more active'
