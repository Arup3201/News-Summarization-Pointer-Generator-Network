Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, is accused of killing his wife

A retired sheriff's deputy recently diagnosed with ALS is accused of murdering his wife, who was responsible for raising more than $20,000 to help him battle the disease.

Authorities say ex-Dane County deputy Andrew P. Steele shot and killed 39-year-old Ashlee C. Steele and her sister, Kacee M. Tollefsbol, 38, of Lake Elmo, on Friday in the couple's Fitchburg, Wisconsin, home.

The Dane County Medical Examiner determined both deaths were homicides.

Fitchburg Police were called to the couple's home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 12:15 p.m. Friday and discovered one woman dead at the scene.

A second was gravely injured and rushed to hospital where she later died.

Police also found Steele inside the home and he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt. 

He was arrested in connection with the double homicide.

As of Sunday, no charges had been filed against him, according to Twincities.com, and no motive has been released for the slayings.

The Steeles had two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband had four children.

Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed.

Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4.

His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses.

The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May.

The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed.

'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said.

It had got so bad, the website said, that teh muscle-twitrching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food.

As of Saturday, August 23, supporters had raised nearly $23,000 from 266 donations toward the $75,000 goal of the fundraiser, according to Twincities.com.

There were 62 days left to raise the full amount.

Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.'

Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was descibed as 'the love of his life.'

The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael.

Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.'
