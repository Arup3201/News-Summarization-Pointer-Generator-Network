Controversial: Sean Stone has voiced his support for Iran and sympathy for Middle Easterners who question Jewish settlers' ties to the land of Israel

Actor Sean Stone, the son of renowned director Oliver Stone, has said he believes 9/11 was 'probably an inside job' and questions the real threat of so-called terrorists.

The 28-year-old, who converted to Islam last year, has described the Quran as a 'very sensible book' and explained why he thinks Middle Easterners oppose European Jews settling in Israel.

The young actor appears to be following in the footsteps, to some extent, of his father Oliver Stone, who has in the past rallied against what he has called Israel's 'powerful lobby in Washington'.

In his latest interview, Sean Stone told a reporter atÂ Russia Today, Russia's English-language television network, that '9/11 was probably an inside job of some kind, that it was not simply a rag-tag group of terrorists led by bin Laden who conducted this operation'.

The subsequent 'war on terror' that ensued, Mr Stone described as 'over a decade of constant fear mongering and aggression'.

The actor, who has appeared in many of his father's films including Nixon, Natural Born Killers and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, says the information fed to us about 'boogeyman terrorists' - whether from Russia, North Korea or Muslims - is 'propaganda'.

'What is that system? It's a cycle of fear that has to be broken internally,' he says.

Meanwhile, the younger Stone questions what difference there is between suicide bombers and covert drones dropping missiles.

In a previous interview, Mr Stone has said Iran's outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was 'misunderstood' and has also now said the idea of Iran funding a terrorist organisation in Hezbollah is an 'exaggeration'

He said: 'Because we killed them with our missiles we don't consider ourselves terrorists. We only consider those who blow themselves up terrorists. And obviously you cannot create that qualification. That's a 1984 Orwellian double speak term.'

He described the whole concept of terrorism as 'quite insane'.

The actor then went on to voice his views on Iran, saying he believed the idea of the country as a 'great terrorist enemy' is 'not true'.

'They're very civilised people. They have a 3,000-year history. They are not looking to destroy themselves in the process of a war against... Israel unless there's a good motivation to do so.'

The 28-year-old actor said in the RT interview that he believed the 9/11 attacks were 'probably and inside job' and questioned the ability of a 'rag-tag' group led by bin Laden to carry it out

In the RT interview, which has been picked up by Yahoo News, Mr Stone says it's 'debatable' whether Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation'.

The Lebanon-based group, which is funded and trained by Iran, is considered to be 'defenders of the Lebanese sovereignty' since they operate within Lebanon's borders, he says.

The young actor appears to be following somewhat in the footsteps of his father, director Oliver Stone, who has campaigned against Jewish lobby groups in the U.S.

He adds he thinks it's an 'exaggeration' to say Iran is a 'terrorist sponsor' and points out that Lebanon has been invaded by Israel numerous times.

On the subject of Israel, he is sympathetic with Middle Easterners' view of the country as a 'crusader state'.

He says when they see European or Russian Jews coming to Israel to settle, they question what ties they have to the land.

He says: 'Now, I'm not a proponent of attacking Israel or trying to dissolve it at this point, but I'm simply saying that that is why there's so much antagonism to Israel.'
