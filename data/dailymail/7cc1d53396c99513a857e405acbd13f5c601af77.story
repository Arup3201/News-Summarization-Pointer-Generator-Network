At least 91 protesters and police were eared dead in Cairo last night as a ‘day of rage’ ended in inevitable bloodshed.

Supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi called for fresh demonstrations after more than 600 people were killed when attempts to clear protest camps earlier in the week turned into a massacre.

The fresh violence erupted when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers.

Dozens died when security forces opened fire in Ramses Square, the focal point for demonstrators.

Some marchers heading towards the square jumped from road bridges to escape bullets and clouds of tear gas.

Another 25 demonstrators were killed 
outside the capital, according to reports, and security officials said 
24 policemen had died in the fighting.

David Cameron was due to discuss the 
crisis by telephone last night with French President Francois Hollande 
amid urgent calls for EU foreign ministers to meet over the 
deteriorating situation.

It came as British tour operators came
 under increasing pressure to suspend holidays to Egypt as governments 
around Europe started warning their citizens to stay at home.

Companies such as Thomas Cook are 
cancelling holidays booked by German customers – but are still flying 
Britons out to Red Sea resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh because of 
differing advice issued by the two countries.

The Muslim Brotherhood – the party of 
the ousted president – called for a ‘Friday of Anger’ in response to the
 mass killing on Wednesday when security forces cleared protest camps 
set up after last month’s military coup.

Beforehand the military-backed 
government had authorised the use of live ammunition, warning anyone 
attacking the police or official buildings would be dealt with 
‘severely’.

Tanks and armoured vehicles blockaded key routes around 
Cairo and when protesters converged on Ramses Square, police fired tear 
gas and gunshots echoed around the capital.

In a nearby mosque, transformed into a field hospital, one witness counted at least 35 bodies.

Much of the anger was directed at Egypt’s army commander General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

‘The people want the butcher executed,’ said Mustafa Ibrahim, 37, as he marched with a crowd of several thousand demonstrators.

But the population remains deeply 
divided, with residents helping the army block access to Cairo’s Rabaa 
al-Adawiya mosque, the focal point of Wednesday’s bloodbath when at 
least 638 were killed and thousands injured.

While the capital has seen the worst 
of violence, there are increasing fears it will spread to popular Red 
Sea resorts, just an eight-hour drive from Cairo.

More than 40,000 British holidaymakers are in Egypt, predominantly in these resorts.

Germany’s Foreign Ministry advised Germans not to go anywhere in Egypt, prompting Thomas Cook and Tui to suspend all holidays.

Meanwhile in the UK, both Thomas Cook 
and Thomson, owned by Tui, are continuing to fly out holidaymakers, 
citing current Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice that it remains 
safe to do so.

Thomson said: ‘Should FCO advice change we have contingency plans in place and we will act accordingly.’

Thomas Cook said: ‘Further to our 
FCO’s directive, Thomas Cook UK & Ireland’s booking conditions will 
remain as normal until such a time as their advisory changes.’

Kuoni yesterday began offering UK holidaymakers worried by the violence refunds or a ‘suitable alternative holiday’.
