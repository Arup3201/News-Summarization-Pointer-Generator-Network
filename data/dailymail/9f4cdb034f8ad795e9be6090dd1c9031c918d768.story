Arsene Wenger's 65th birthday celebration finally went off with a bang on Wednesday night. When Lukas Poldolski hit the hugely unlikely 90th-minute winner here, frustrated Anderlecht fans threw an exploding firework on the pitch.

It was an act of extreme recklessness but doubtless caused by utter frustration and disbelief in the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. As a knot of Arsenal players celebrated their unlikely saviour in Podolski in front of their travelling fans in one corner of the ground, all around there was a sense of incredulity.

For 88 minutes Anderlecht, the Belgian champions, had not just held Arsenal at bay; in the second half they had dominated them. They were were well worth their 71st-minute opener, set up by the excellent Dennis Praet, once a Gunners trialist, and finished at the near post by Andy Najar.

Not only that, they should have finished Arsenal off. It was Emiliano Martinez, the 22-year-old goalkeeper on whom so much pressure had been placed, who kept them in the game, making a string of saves, notably from Matias Suarez on 84 minutes. And it was the post that rescued them from an Anthony Vanden Borre chip on 80 minutes.

Arsenal were creaking, the limitations of this squad seemingly exposed for all Europe to see, as were their pretensions as challengers for this trophy. But something curious has happened to Arsenal this season; the spirit that once characterised this side has returned. Their late comebacks are becoming a regular feature of games. This, though, topped the lot.

Wenger, understated as ever, took the dramatic last two minutes completely in his stride. ‘It’s a bit unexpected to take the three points, considering the quality of the match that Anderlecht played tonight,’ said Wenger, his lips curling into the beginnings of a grin.

‘I know by experience that the last five minutes in the Champions League, the nerves play a part. And that we had to get into these five minutes without conceding the second goal.’

‘A bit unexpected’ was stretching it. When Calum Chambers advanced into Anderlecht’s half in the 89th minute there had barely been a significant Arsenal chance since Santi Cazorla forced a 64th-minute save from Silvio Proto. But Chambers, who had endured a troubled night, redeemed himself: his cross was superb, the finish from Kieran Gibbs, at the far post and drilled across goal, even better.

That in itself would have represented something remarkable. Just over a minute later substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain advanced goalwards, with Anderlecht complaining bitterly of a foul. His pass found Alexis Sanchez, who shot, and amid a rebound and something of a scramble, up popped perennial reserve Podolski to record the most improbable victory

‘We always know he can score,’ said Wenger, denying that his German World Cup winner had been close to leaving in the summer due to his lack of appearances.

‘He is frustrated and I understand that of course. But he’s important as well and he showed that tonight and he will be important in the coming months. It took him a while to get back to a good physical level after the World Cup and now he’s nearly there.

‘He has 115 caps for Germany; that is not a coincidence, that shows you the quality. I think he is a guy you want to have the ball in the box. His shot is fantastic, his accuracy is great and he has very short backlift.’

There was praise too for Martinez, very impressive since it was his third Arsenal appearance. I had no worry for our goalkeeper because he has the presence and the quality and he resists stress well.

For the rest? There was little to say. ‘We had the spirit,’ said Wenger. ‘It was disappointing we didn’t create more chances tonight but I put that down to the fact as well that Anderlecht defended very well.'

Prior to that spectacular ending, Wenger’s birthday celebrations were proving very flat in Brussels. It was as though all the invited guests turned up but there was no cake, an absence of party poppers and definitely no champagne moments.The vintage Arsenal of old, with which we associate Wenger, went missing.

A solid Anderlecht side, who made up in endeavour what they lacked in quality, were too much for the visitors.

The first half was a rum affair, neither side displaying much quality other than on the defensive side. The second started more promisingly. Ibrahima Conte almost provided Arsenal with the unpleasant shock on 48 minutes.

Mertesacker mistakenly let the ball run across the box and Conte found himself with time and space to shoot. His strike was deflected wide but it was enough to lift the Anderlecht crowd, who increasingly believed they had the measure of the Premier League side.

Their cause gathered momentum when Praet, increasingly influential, had space to play in Conte down the left on 53 minutes. Chambers seemed to react slowly and for a moment the 23-year-old Anderlecht winger looked as though he had the measure of Arsenal’s right back, and was poised to beat him as Chambers struggled back. Ultimately Chambers came out on top, winning the ball back cleanly, despite penalty appeals from his opponents.

Arsenal could muster precious little in response. Sanchez again got clear on 55 minutes and pulled back a cross but Ramsey fired his effort well wide.

Cazorla then burst free on 64 minutes but was blocked by Silvio Porto with Sanchez lifting the rebound over. After that there was little more, until that finish. At least it can be said they saved the real celebration until last.
