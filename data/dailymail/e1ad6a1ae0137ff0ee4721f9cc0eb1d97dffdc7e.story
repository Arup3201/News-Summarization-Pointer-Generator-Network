Alexis Sanchez is back for Arsenal to face Leicester City on Tuesday evening after missing the north London derby at the weekend.

The forward has been Arsene Wenger’s standout player this season since his £30million move from Barcelona in the summer.

He had been struggling with a hamstring problem and was sorely missed by Arsene Wenger as his side let slip a one-goal lead to lose the derby against Tottenham.

Sanchez has scored 18 goals in 32 matches in all competitions for Arsenal in his debut campaign, including 12 in the Premier League.

The 26-year-old has drawn plaudits since moving to England for his tireless work-rate up and down the pitch.

‘Sanchez will be back in the group,’ a delighted Wenger revealed. ‘And we don’t have any injuries from Saturday.

‘He is our best goalscorer and one of our hardest working players in the team. Physically I think we suffered a little bit on some occasions on Saturday. It’s good to have him back.’

Jack Wilshere has returned to training with the first team following his lay-off with an ankle injury but Wenger is still unsure when the midfielder will be able to play again.

‘We have to monitor him on a daily basis and see how he develops,’ Wenger added.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has also been ruled out for ‘at least two more weeks’ by the Arsenal manager.
