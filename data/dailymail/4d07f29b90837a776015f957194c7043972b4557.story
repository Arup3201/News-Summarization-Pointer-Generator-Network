Found: A female body found earlier today is Celina Cass

The father of 11-year-old Celina Cass, whose body was found this week, is bedridden with exhaustion and severe heart problems.

The unsolved death of Adam Laro's daughter is said to be 'killing him' while detectives continue to investigate her 'suspicious' death after autopsy results were inconclusive.

Meanwhile a neighbour of the family, who live in the small town of Stewartstown, said Celina's home was more like a 'party stable' with people coming in and out all the time.

Robbie 
Kimball, the owner of nearby Wayne’s Lanes and Jo’s Grill, said: 'They had people that were in and out of there all the time. It was the get-together hangout.'

Celina went missing from the bedroom of her home almost two weeks ago and a large-scale search was underway until her body was recovered in the Connecticut River on Monday.

According to relatives she will be placed in a pink casket and cremated soon.

Her grandmother, Marcia Laro, told the Boston Herald that Celina's father's health is deteriorating because of her unsolved death.

She said: 'Today was not good. His heart
is critical. He was supposed to have open-heart surgery, but he’s too 
weak for it...His health is very bad.'

Adam Laro suffered congestive heart 
failure and spent more than a week in a coma prior to Celina’s 
disappearance the night of July 25.

He left the hospital last week and 
made a public plea for her return - against doctors’ advice.

Police have seized two pick-up trucks in their investigation - one belonging to her stepfather Wendell Noyes, who has a history of mental illness, and the other driven by another man who lives at her home.

Natasha Newell, who works with Celina’s mother Louisa Noyes, said other relatives, including Louisa’s 
ex-boyfriend’s son, her sister and her aunt, also lived in the house.

Community residents were saddened that the autopsy wasn't able to provide them with any closure.

'I don't even know what to say. I thought the community needed some answers, and I thought we were going to get them tonight,' said Debbie Whelan, whose daughter, a friend of Celina's, was sobbing after watching a news report on a TV monitor.

The lack of answers was 'scary,' said Shannon Towle, who owns a convenience store across the street from the house where Celina lived with her mother, sister, stepfather and a man named Kevin Mullaney, said by neighbors to be the son of a former boyfriend of her mother, Louisa Noyes.

'We still don't know what happened, and that's terrifying,' Towle said.

Celina's death has been deemed 
suspicious, based on what divers found, and investigators were treating 
the case as a criminal investigation.

After the news conference, teenagers gathered in a town park, where candles were lit in Celina's memory.

'Someone has to light the way for Celina,' said Kayla Baglio, 18.

'It's to let her know no matter what, people are going to be here for her.'

On Tuesday, investigators combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found.

A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area.

At the peak of the search for Celina, more than 100 federal, state 
and local law enforcement officers descended upon the town of 800 
residents, searching a mile-wide area around her home, including woods 
and ponds.

Because
of the town's remote location, law enforcement officers went so far as 
to have a cellphone tower erected to assist in communications.

Troubled past: Celina Cass's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003 and was hospitalised earlier this week

On Monday, the intense search came to an abrupt end when New Hampshire Fish and Game Department divers found her body near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River between Stewartstown and Canaan.

Investigators on Tuesday combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found. A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area.

Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, who reportedly was hospitalized hours before her body was recovered from the river, returned to the community Tuesday.

Witnesses said Noyes was taken away by ambulance Monday after lying down with his face in his arms outside a home where he had been staying in Stewartstown.

Hospital officials declined to say whether he was a patient.

Shannon Towle, owner of Towle's Mini-Mart, said she sold him cigarettes Tuesday morning.

In the first days after Celina disappeared, Noyes had described her as a quiet girl who would not have left home on her own, but he had declined to comment further.

Residents considered cancelling their 
annual children's fair in light of the fifth-grader's death but instead 
decided to go forward with the weekend event and to dedicate it to her 
memory.

'It's still a scary place for our 
children,' Patricia Grover, who's on the organising committee for 
Stewartstown Days said.

He added: 'They need something 
that's on a little happier note for them.'

After her body was discovered, 
several of the 11-year-old's relatives could be seen at her home crying 
and roads were blocked off with reporters also asked to leave.

Meanwhile, Celina's stepfather was 
hospitalised after he was said to have taken a 'funny turn' on the 
driveway of the family home earlier today after talking to reporters.

Wendell
Noyes, who was reportedly involuntarily committed to a mental 
institution and diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003, was seen 
repeatedly lying face down and rolling around in the driveway.

He was said to be receiving treatment for his mental illness.

Celina, who lived with her mother and stepfather, was last seen on Monday night playing on her  computer. The next morning, she was gone.

Residents
described Celina as a sweet, friendly child. One of Celina's best 
friends, 11-year-old Makayla Riendeau, said Celina loves her mother and 
likes her stepfather and wouldn't run away.

She
said Celina is very athletic, is a stickler about getting her school 
work done on time and loves having friends over to her house.
