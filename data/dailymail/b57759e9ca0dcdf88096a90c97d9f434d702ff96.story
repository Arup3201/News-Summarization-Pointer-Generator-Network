For many, a cross between a spider and a shark would be the stuff of nightmares, while mixing a kangaroo and a mango something someone might dream up after too much cheese before bed.

But for one enterprising artist these crazy animal mashups have become a virtual reality at least after she used photoshop software to merge creatures together in an intriguing set of pictures.

Sarah DeRemer, 25, originally from California, started making the hybrid animals as a way to improve her Photoshop skills.

Crazy creature: Artist Sarah DeRemer created a host of new species, such as this Laughing Hamstyna - a hybrid of a hamster and hyena - to help improve her Photoshop skills

Stuff of nightmares: Many people would find the thought of a cross between a spider and a shark to terrifying to even contemplate

Hybrid: Here Ms DeRemer has mixed an eagle with a stag to create this hybrid with both antlers and a beak 

New species: A sparrow and a tabby cat are usually sworn enemies, but they come together in this hybrid created by Ms DeRemer

Fruity combination: Ms DeRemer does not limit herself to animals when coming up with the new species. Here she has combined a kangaroo and a mango - the Mangaroo

Painstaking work: Ms DeRemer works with 20 layers on her pictures to make the combinations between the animals, here a killer whale and a black Labrador, seemless

Now she has come up with a set of completely new creatures by merging the cutest members of the animal world with the most ferocious.

Each image can take up to four hours to complete and Ms DeRemer, who now lives in Seoul, South Korea, works with 20 layers on the picture to make the combinations seamless.

Among her creations are the Laughing Hamstyna - a hamster and hyena blend, a Fierce Schnowlzer - aka a dog and a vulture, and has even combined a kangaroo and a mango. 

Creature discomfort: This cross between a cat and a Pomeranian does not look like the friendliest of creatures

Fierce creatures: Ms DeRemer says she enjoys the juxtaposition of cure and scary animals, such as this dog and vulture, which come together to create a Fierce Schnowlzer

Favourite: Ms DeRemer says the combination of a baboon and a sparrow, which she has named the Birboon, is one of her favourite creations

A new class of sheepdog: The artist has named the combination of sheep and dog German Shepherds

Something to squawk about: What do you get if you cross a panda and an owl? A Pandowl of course

Art work: Tapirs are known for their protruding snouts, but would one be much use on the body of a shark?

Combination: This Angry Beavussy was created from a cat and a beaver by Ms DeRemer, who is originally from California but who now lives in South Korea

The King Charles Spanbull: Here Ms DeRemer has blended together a spaniel and a bull 

Juxtaposition: This animal was created using photographs of a hairless sphinx cat and the face of a pig

'I really enjoy the juxtaposition between cute and scary animals, such as a growling wolf on a pygmy marmoset, or a snarling tiger on a baby monkey,' she said.

'It’s hard to pick a favorite, but I really enjoy both the “Birboon” and “Little Bit” because they’re such adorable little birds with such character from the yawning animals.

'I also really love the White Tiger Monkey because the two animals included are so drastically different but go together so well.' 

The idea has legs: Each image can take up to four hours to complete, such as this one which combines a sperm whale and a giraffe to make an African Blue Whirrafano

Would its bark be worse than its bite? A cross between a  a snake and terrier - The Green Bark Python

All creatures great and small: This cross between a  a wolf and a finger monkey has been named the Ferocious Pygmy Marmowolf by Ms DeRemer

Raising a smile: Meet the Highland Red Pandow, a cross between a red panda and a yak

Devil dog: Here Ms DeRemer has merged a Tasmanian devil and a puppy to make the Tasmanian Labrador

Enough to make you scream: A cross between a rat and a macaque - also known as a Rankey

Baring its teeth: A wombat and a bat combine to form this rather angry looking creature

New species: A Doffalo is created by Ms DeRemer by splicing a labrador and a buffalo

King of the forest: Here a bear and a deer are merged to create a creature that would give any hiker who came across it a bit of a fright

Yawn! A tired-looking seal and a blue tit combine to create a Sleepy Pirdy

Perfect blend? Ms DeRemer says she loves the White Tiger Monkey because 'the two animals included are so drastically different but go together so well'

Singing for his supper: A chipmunk crossed with a sparrow gives way to this animal

Open wide: A lion and a llama join forces to become this yawning Peruvian Llioma
