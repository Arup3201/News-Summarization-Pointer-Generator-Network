Penalty: Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha was caught speeding in his £188,000 Lamborghini Gallardo

Fine: Zaha is expected to receive a fine of at least £100 and he will also be given three points on his licence

Zaha has been linked with a return to former club Crystal Palace on loan after struggling to break into the United team, having signed for £15million in January 2013. 

The winger was loaned back to Palace for the remainder of the 2012-13 season before returning to United and struggling to break into first David Moyes' and then Louis van Gaal's first-team plans.

He was loaned out to Cardiff City last season but struggled to make an impact as the team were relegated from the Premier League. 

A Metropolitan police spokesman, quoted in the Croydon Guardian, said; 'On Wednesday, August 20, at approximately 11pm, traffic officers stopped a black Lamborghini Gallardo in Farthing Way and the driver, a 21-year-old man, was issued with a fixed penalty notice for speeding.'

Wanted: Crystal Palace hope to bring the player back to the club on loan from Manchester United this season
