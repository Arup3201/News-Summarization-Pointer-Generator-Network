With Christmas just around the corner, it's not unusual to see fans around the world getting into the festive spirit by wearing Santa hats to games.

But Montpellier winger Anthony Mounier showed that it's the season of goodwill for players as well, pulling out a hat of his own on Saturday.

After firing in from close range to put his side 3-2 up at home to Lens, the Frenchman ran to the crowd to celebrate in the red hat.

However, his team-mates were not able to give him the gift he really wanted, as Montpellier were pegged back late on.

For every moment of Christmas joy there is also a scrooge, and referee Said Ennjimi somewhat spoiled the celebration by producing a yellow card, rather than a Christmas card, for Mounier.

The game, in which the hosts had led 2-0 after just 16 minutes before Lens pulled back to equalise before half time, ended 3-3, which leaves Lens 19th in the table.
