Southampton may have sold most of their star players, but they're doing well in pre-season. Ronald Koeman's men have won more games than any other Premier League club.

The Dutch boss had a tough task on his hands this summer, arriving at his first English side who subsequently sold Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers.

Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez could also follow, but their pre-season form (five wins out of five) suggests their new signings are settling in well.

Tough start: But Ronald Koeman will be impressed by his side's pre-season form ahead of the Premier League

The Saints have beaten EHC Hoensbroek, Sporting Hasselt, Swindon, Bournemouth and Brighton with only one friendly against Bayer Leverkusen remaining.

Sunderland,  Leicester and impressively Manchester United are also 100 per cent in their warm-up games, only missing out on top spot due to a lack of games and goal difference.

Meanwhile, after bringing in Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle and Ryan Bertrand, Koeman is keen to conclude more deals swiftly.

A swap with Inter Milan involving Pablo Osvaldo and Saphir Taider is thought to be close, while more could arrive over the weekend.

Koeman said: 'I won't talk about any of the players but we are looking to bring in players into this squad at the level that we need to have a good season.

'We are close to signing two or three players and we hope to do that by this weekend.' 

Settling in: New signing Dusan Tadic scored against Brighton in Southampton's latest friendly
