Suspension: Math teacher Brooke Hesson (pictured left with unidentified man) has been placed on leave from her Arizona school over allegations she had sex with a student

A high school math teacher and cheerleading coach has been placed on administrative leave while an Arizona school district investigates allegations she slept with a male student. 

However, the Tempe Police Department says they will not bring up charges against teacher Brooke Hesson, because the student was 18 at the time and issued consent. 

'Because he's 18 (and) everything was consensual, there's no crime and we're not pursuing any charges,' Sgt Mike Pooley of the Temple Police told The Arizona Republic. 

'We're still investigating to make sure there was no inappropriate conduct prior to him being 18 and there were no other students involved that were under 18,' he added.

Hesson is married and has been working at Marcos de Niza High School since 2010. 

School administrators found out about the allegations after receiving a student tip, Sgt Pooley said. 

Tempe Union High School District immediately placed Hesson on administrative leave on October 17 while they investigate the charges.

'She was placed on administrative leave and is under investigation of misconduct, but we don't have all the facts yet,' Tempe Union High School District spokesman Jill Hanks said. 'We received allegations Friday afternoon and under protocol sent her home.'

According to a profile on the school's website, Hesson teaches Algebra 1-2, Algebra 3-4 and Functions of Mathematics. 

She received her bachelor's degree from Arizona State University.  

A letter was sent home to the parents' of Hesson's students and cheer squad members, explaining her absence was due to 'allegations of misconduct'. 

School administrators have not said whether Hesson would be returning to teaching.  

No legal action: Local authorities have said they will not charge Hesson because the student was 18 at the time and provided consent. She has been working at Marcos de Niza High School in 2010 (above)
