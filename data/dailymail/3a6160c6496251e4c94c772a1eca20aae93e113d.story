Single mother Sanaa Derbas will face court next month for allegedly conning a string of elderly men out of $2 million in a lonely hearts scam - and then using the cash to fund her lavish lifestyle.

The 39-year-old was arrested on Thursday at her Miller home in Sydney's west and charged with offences which are more commonly committed by Nigerian fraudsters.

She is accused of trawling lonely hearts messages online and in newspapers to find her alleged victims, who were all in their 60s and 70s. She is believed to have formerly owned a cosmetics business called 'Provocative Nails'.

Derbas, whose children are aged two to 16, will appear in court on June 25 to face several counts of fraud and money laundering.  

She is the first person in Australia to be charged with these offences in relation to a lonely hearts scam. 

The mother-of-four, who receives $1,500 a fortnight in welfare payments, is accused of using sites like Lavalife and Meeting Point to target older men.

She used the proceeds of her alleged crimes to fund a lifestyle of flashy cars, exotic getaways, designer handbags and plastic surgery, the Daily Telegraph reported.

It is also alleged she purchased a home in Miller, knocked it down and built a brand-new one.

On Friday, one man, a woman and a teenage boy arrived next door to the woman's Miller home, where Ms Derbas's mother is believed to live.

Relatives of the woman also occupy a third house next door, neighbours said.

After arriving at the mother's house the man, named Gus, who was dressed in grey cargo pants, a hoodie and sunglasses turned the garden hose on reporters in the street.

Another neighbour, Lyn, yelled out her support and said when asked about the alleged fraud of the elderly men, 'good on her, if they're that stupid'.

Emanuel, who lives across the road from the woman said she had built her current brick house in the last few years,  replacing  an older house.

'She is a lovely woman with lovely kids,' he said.

A woman in the street told MailOnline the woman's family were of Lebanese background and had lived in the street for many years.

She said the alleged con woman 'fancies herself'  and had had plastic surgery.One man in the street said people joked about the woman's botox injections and her 'butt lift'.

Police allege one man handed over $1.9million to Ms Derbas while others gave her $190,000, $58,000 and $12,000. Police say that there may be more victims.

Three of the men she allegedly duped had not even met her. One of them was an interstate businessman and had a sexual relationship with her at his north shore apartment.

NSW Fraud and and Cybercrime Squad's Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis said the woman was a master at manipulating the older men.

'This woman was very good convincing men that she was in love with them and that they were in a relationship,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

NSW Police will allege the woman had five bank accounts and invented sob stories to convince her victims to deposit the money in her account.

Detective Katsogiannis said she would tell men a relative in Egypt had died and she needed money to get the funds released from the state or her child needed an operation in Melbourne.

Police will also allege she laundered money by buying cars and selling them off at a loss

'We will allege she used a number of these stories to play on the men's good nature and emotions,' he said.

It is also alleged the woman laundered money by buying expensive cars and then selling them at a loss.

Detective Katsogiannis said this type of scam was often performed overseas and police believed this was the first time anyone in Australia had been charged with doing it.

He commended the men for having the courage to come forward and report something that was 'potentially very embarrassing'.

More than $1 million and assets have been frozen by police, and the woman's cars were seized on Thursday.

She is currently on bail and is due to appear at Liverpool Local Court on June 25.

It is also alleged the woman bought a home in Miller, knocked it down and rebuilt a new one
