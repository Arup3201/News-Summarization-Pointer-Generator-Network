Concern: Ronaldo speaks with Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti during training on Tuesday

Setback: Ronaldo was replaced by striker Alvaro Morata against Real Valladolid on Wednesday

And the decision to risk him just 17 days before Real take on Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final appeared to have backfired as he limped off against Real Valladolid.

Ronaldo's team-mate Gareth Bale had earlier been ruled out of the game because of injury.

Ronaldo came off in the eighth minute at 
the Jose Zorilla Stadium without showing any clear signs of being in 
pain, just moments after his long run through the opponent's half came 
to an end when he clashed with a defender.

Real Madrid took the lead after a 
stunning Sergio Ramos free-kick but saw their title hopes suffer a 
devastating blow after Humberto Osorio grabbed a late equaliser for 
second-from-bottom Valladolid.

Doubt: Ronaldo lies on the pitch after being tackled during Wednesday's must-win match

Painful: Ronaldo grimaces as he leaves the pitch at the Jose Zorrilla stadium

Support: Sergio Ramos ran over to Ronaldo after scoring the first goal for Real Madrid

The Portugal international had recently been troubled by a knee and muscle injury in his left leg, but had returned to play in Madrid's Champions League semi-final triumph over Bayern Munich.

Ronaldo has scored 50 goals this season in all competitions, including a league-leading 31 goals.
