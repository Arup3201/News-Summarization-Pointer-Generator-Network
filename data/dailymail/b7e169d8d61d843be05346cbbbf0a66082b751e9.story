They say less is more, and that is certainly true for this petrifying two-minute horror movie.

The simple story titled Lights Out starts with a girl turning off her light to go to bed - sparking a terrifying stand-off with a demon.

The 120 seconds of classic horror techniques that ensue will leave you never wanting to turn your light off again.

Mystery: The two-minute movie starts with the girl turning off her hallway light to see a mysterious silhouette

Petrified: She grows increasingly tense, turning the light on and off, but seemingly nobody is there

Directed by award-winning short film maker David F Sandberg, the dialogue-free short caused a flurry when it came out last year.

Having resurfaced, it is stirring viewers all over again.

It starts with a girl, played by actress Lotta Losten, in a pyjama top flicking off the light in her hallway.Â 

With seemingly nobody else in the flat, she freezes at the sight of a silhouette.

The horror movie by award-winning director David F Sandberg has once again caused a flurry on Twitter

Despite having no dialogue, it is packed full of classic horror techniques as the girl tussles with her fears

Still scared, she tapes the light switch to keep it on, which many viewers may well be tempted to do now

She turns the light back on, and the silhouette disappears.

As she continues flicking back and forth, the music intensifies, until she duct tapes the switch to keep it on.

An extreme step? Apparently not, for as she lies in bed, the light goes once more.

Once in bed, she feels no safer, staring at her half-open door as the light flickers then goes out

Then, it is the bedside lamp that starts going. Burying her head under the covers, she fumbles for the plug

Using just two rooms, two lights, and one actress, Sandberg has terrified viewers

It is a classic build-up to an ending that has sent Twitter users into some sort of frenzy.

One user shared the video, exclaiming: 'OMG this is Freaky as hell!!!'

Another said: 'I love being scared but I have to admit I watched most of this through my fingers!'

While one simply tweeted: 'TRAUMATIZING!'
