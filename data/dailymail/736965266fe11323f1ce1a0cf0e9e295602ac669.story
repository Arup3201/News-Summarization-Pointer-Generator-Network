An entire Pacific nation could be forced to move emigrate after their land started to disappear beneath the waves.

The tide has started to reach the villages and homes of the people that live on top of the 33 flat coral islands that make up the Kiribati islands.

Anote Tong, the Kiribati 
president, has announced he is in talks with Fiji to buy 
up to 5,000 acres of land on for his citizens to live on.

The move could be the world's first 
climate-induced migration of recent times.

All of the islands, bar one are atolls - ring-shaped islands with central lagoons -Â  and of the 33 atolls of Kiribati, 21 are inhabited.

But some of them already under water and most of its 113,000 people are crammed on to a chain of tiny spaces of land curving around a lagoon.

'This is the last resort, there's no way out of this one,' Mr Tong explained, reported the Telegraph.

Our people will have to move as the tides have reached our homes and villages.'

The president said skilled workers will be to sent to Fiji first, so they could fit in easily with the country's population and provide a positive contribution to the economy.

'They need to find employment, not as 
refugees but as immigrant people with skills to offer, people who have a
place in the community, people who will not be seen as second-class 
citizens,' he told the state-run Fiji One television channel.

The land Kiribati wants to purchase is understood to be on Vanua Levu, which is Fiji's second largest island.

In recent years, Mr Tong has been desperate to find a solution to the problem of the rising sea level.

Last year he looked at the possibility of constructing man-made islands similar to oil rigs for his people to live on.

An Education for Migration programme, has been launched, aimed to make the citizens more attractive as skilled migrants.

Kiribati youngsters study for degrees at the University of the South Pacific, which is based in the Fijian capital of Suva.

Many islanders are concerned that their culture may disappear with the population migration.

Formerly known as the Gilbert Islands, the country won independence from the United Kingdom in 1979.

Kiribati used to lie either side of 
the International Date Line, but in 1995 the government moved the line 
eastwards, ensuring it was the same in the whole country.

This meant Kiribati was the first inhabited place on Earth to greet the new millennium on 1 January 2000.

Caroline Island was renamed Millennium Island and many media outlets travelled out to the country to mark the event.

The atolls stretch nearly 4,000 km from east to west, more than 2,000 km from north to south, and straddle the Equator - none of the coral atolls rises more than a few feet above sea level.
