Mike Rigg has quit the Football Association after one year to take up a new role as Fulham's Chief Football Officer.

Rigg left his role as the FA's head of talent identification to accept the job at Craven Cottage as chairman Shahid Khan continues to overhaul personnel at the club and build a structure to support new manager Kit Symons.

Khan said: 'Based on my experience over the past 17 months and through the most recent managerial search, it became clear to me that the new Fulham manager - in fact, the entire football operation - would benefit from someone whose sole responsibility was to focus on the short, mid and long-term product on the pitch.

Rigg, who formerly worked as technical director at Manchester City and QPR, was only at the FA for one year 

'In my mind, that called for a head of all football activities that would report directly to me but work collaboratively with Kit, our scouting group, the Academy, sports performance medical and our analytics team.

'This wasn't a revelation, but rather the recognition that the challenges football clubs face today are more complex than ever and our ambition requires that we organise in the optimal way to achieve our goals.

'But we were not interested in accelerating this organisational shift for Fulham until, or unless, we found the right person. And we have in Mike Rigg.'

Khan stressed the position of Huw Jennings as academy director will remain unchanged and crucial to the future. 'Player development will be at the core of our foundation at Fulham,' said the chairman.

Chief executive Alistair Mackintosh will be asked to focus more on commercial matters and projects like the development of the Riverside Stand at Craven Cottage and the expansion of the training ground.

It is less than a month since Dan Ashworth, the FA's director of elite development, launched his document detailing the DNA of English football and hailed Rigg's role in the project.

'We are really sorry to see Mike go but we totally understand his reasons,' said Ashworth, in a statement released by the FA. 'It was always likely he would move back into club football at some stage, as this type of role becomes increasingly common within the game.

'Mike has played a huge part in the transformation of the way in which we work in talent identification and helped build and shape a department that looks after both the male and female game.

'I would like to place on record my thanks for all of his hard work and support and wish him well in his new role at Fulham.'

The return is quicker than anticipated for Rigg, who worked in various technical development and scouting roles for Sheffield Wednesday, Blackburn, Manchester City and QPR before joining the FA in 2013.

Rigg told the FA's website: 'Over the last 12 months I have been fortunate to work with some of the most inspirational and talented people in football that I have experienced over the last 25 years.

'I believe and know that The FA – under Dan and Gareth Southgate's leadership – is on the right path with its plans and philosophy.

'I genuinely wish them and all of my friends at St. George's Park and Wembley the best of luck going forward. They can count on my support in my new role at Fulham.'
