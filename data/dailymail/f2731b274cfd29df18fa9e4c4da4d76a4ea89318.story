Desperation: Paul and Sandra Dunham, who are facing extradition to the US over fraud charges, have revealed they tried to kill themselves in order to avoid prison

The British couple facing extradition to America over an expenses row were remanded in custody last night due to fears they could make a fresh suicide attempt.

It came after retired businessman Paul Dunham and his wife Sandra, both 58, admitted they took a drug overdose earlier this week to avoid the prospect of dying in a US jail.

The couple had been due to hand themselves to police at 10am on Thursday, before being passed to US authorities.

But officers rushed to their £600,000 home in Northampton at 7.15am after concerns were raised over their welfare.

Speaking from his hospital bed at Northampton General yesterday, Mr Dunham said:  ‘When we felt there was no hope, the prospect of what lay ahead of us in the US, we felt that wasn’t worth living for.’

'If you look statistically, white collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain.

'If you look at this in the cold light of day we have gone through this rationally so many times in our minds.

'Somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain.

'We could easily be in the US for six or eight years.

'We would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home.

'Frankly that was a prospect we didn’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for.'

Last month the couple lost a High Court 
battle last month against extradition to Maryland to stand trial over 
fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham's company, Pace.

Mr Dunham is accused of over-claiming
 $1million (£600,000) in expenses when he was chief executive of US firm
 PACE and his wife of aiding and abetting him.

They insist these were ‘wholly legitimate’ business expenses.

The case has caused anger over the 
use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial 
for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute.

Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him.

The Dunhams' failed High Court case 
heard that Mr Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health
 problems, and Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression.

Emergency: Police were called to the Dunhams' Northampton home by a worried journalist who had arrived to take a statement from the couple - only for them to fail to answer the door

The couple, who have five 
grandchildren, 'vehemently reject' allegations relating to expenses 
claims by Mr Dunham while he was working in the US, arguing the spending
 was sanctioned by Pace's board and that auditors raised no objections.

Speaking yesterday, Mr Dunham said the final straw for the couple had come when they learned that Home Secretary had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea Leadsom.

'On Wednesday evening, we were really just hanging on,' he said.

'That evening we got an email from MP Andrea Leadsom saying Theresa May had cancelled her meeting with her.

Treatment: The Dunhams both spent the night at Northampton General Hospital and are expected to be taken to Westminster Magistrates court when they are discharged

'Andrea has worked tirelessly for us - but the people that should care just don’t seem to want to be involved.

'We rationally weighted up all the options and saw no other choice.

'We faced a three year wait for a 
trial in the US and we were already told we were going to be held in a 
high security super max prison with a pretty harsh regime and it 
wouldn’t have the medical facilities for my health.

'We were facing the prospect of enduring eight years of hell, and are still facing the same dilemma.

Denial: The couple, who have five grandchildren, 'vehemently reject' allegations relating to expenses claims by Mr Dunham while he was working in the US

'It’s a bit like when someone has a 
terminal illness, they will sometimes end their lives with the happy 
memories they once had rather than face the terminal illness.

'What we did wasn’t a publicity stunt,
 we fully expected not to be here today and we have to be grateful for 
the police and hospital staff for how they have looked after us over the
 last 24 hours.

'Now we are having to go to separate counselling meetings where we are really saying "what’s next?"

'Nothing’s really changed, the extradition warrant still exists and that hasn’t changed at all.'

A journalist from a local newspaper had arrived at the couple's £500,000 detached home to speak to them but police were alerted when there was no response from the pair.

Officers forced the door open and contacted paramedics, who arrived in two ambulances and took the couple to hospital.

Officers from Northamptonshire Police forced entry to the property after a reporter from the local newspaper dialled 999.

Mr Dunham said: 'A local reporter came
 to interview us because they knew we would be leaving, they had planned
 to meet us as we came out the front door.

'They got suspicious, didn’t see anyone around, once several minutes passed he got concerned and called police.

'I expect to be in hospital for a day 
or two to get over the effects and then we are hoping we will have some 
additional psychological counselling to see whether we can muster the 
strength to face this ordeal.'

Mr Dunham added that his wife has been taken off a drip and is feeling 'very shaken' and is 'struggling to sit up.'

Fear: Mr Dunham says the couple face a three year wait for a trial in the US, and would be held in a high security prison
