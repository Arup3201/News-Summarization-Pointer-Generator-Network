David Cameron has confessed that his wife Samantha only fell for him because he owned a car - and that she may not have been 18 when he fell in love with her.

In a revealing interview with Total Politics magazine, the Prime Minister said he was ‘square’ when he met Samantha, who was friends with his younger sister.

Mr Cameron, who is nearly five years older, said he was only able to woo the teenager because he drove her around and took her out for meals.

‘She claims I was the first boyfriend who had a car and asked her out to dinner,’ he said, ‘but it took a couple of years to persuade her to marry me.’

Mr Cameron seemed uncertain whether his future wife was an adult when he fell for her in his early 20s.

‘She was a very good friend of my 
sister Claire. We have an argument about when we met, but I think it was
when she was 18,’ he said.

‘She was this very laid-back, very 
chilled, rather cool friend of my very cool younger sister, and I was 
the sort of square brother.

'I got to know her on a family holiday, and 
that was pretty much love at first sight.’

Mr Cameron said that since he became Prime Minister he has turned to his wife for support in times of stress.

‘She’s amazing in every single way. I can’t believe how lucky I am to have her,’ he said.

The PM also told the magazine that Culture Minister Ed Vaizey was wrong to have once claimed that Mrs Cameron voted for Tony Blair in 1997.

Mr Cameron also used the interview to toughen his line on Europe, admitting Britain could prosper if the UK leaves the European Union.

In a concession to his rebellious backbenchers, the Prime Minister said there will have to be a ‘full and frank debate’ about whether to break links with Brussels.

Mr Cameron indicated that he would prefer to remain in the EU and renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels, but his words will be seen as opening the door wider to the possibility of British withdrawal.

The Prime Minister has promised a referendum on Britain’s position in the EU by the end of 2017 after seeking a better deal.

But he has previously stressed the potential economic costs of withdrawal.

But in an interview with Total Politics magazine he said: ‘Of course Britain could make her own way if we chose to do so.’

Mr Cameron, who is nearly five years older, said he was only able to woo the then teenage Samantha because he drove her around and took her out for meals

That echoes senior Tories like 
Education Secretary Michael Gove and former Chancellors Nigel Lawson and
Norman Lamont, who have both called for Britain to quit the EU.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ll have to ask 
ourselves: is that what we really want?

'I want to see a reformed EU; 
that’s why I’ve pledged to negotiate a new settlement and then put that 
to people in an in-out referendum.

That
will be the time to have a full and frank debate about our membership.’

The PM dismissed claims by party grandees that he will not be able to 
cut a new deal.

‘I do not agree that we cannot get anything from a negotiation with Europe,’ he said.

‘People said we wouldn’t get the European Union to agree to a cut in the seven-year budget, and they agreed to it.

'They said we couldn’t get Britain out of the EU bailout fund, and we did.

'There are many things people said we couldn’t get from the EU that subsequently we did.’

Leading Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell welcomed the change of heart.

He said: ‘The Prime Minister has left himself some wriggle room.

'He has the option of turning round and saying the deal isn’t good enough. He could conseivably lead the out campaign.

‘I find this incredibly encouraging. Mail readers who have had enough of the EU should be heartened.’
