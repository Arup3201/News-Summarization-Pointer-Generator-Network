The £10 million Iraq War inquiry is set to be delayed until after the election because of continued Whitehall wrangling over what it will be allowed to publish.

Whitehall sources said inquiry chief Sir John Chilcot is still making a ‘steady stream’ of requests asking civil servants to declassify documents – suggesting that the report is still not written.

It also emerged that legal letters to key figures like Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell, spelling out criticism they may face in the report, have not yet been sent out.

The full transcripts of phone calls and letters between George W Bush and Tony Blair will not be published in Chilcot's final report, to the dismay of the families of the 179 British soldiers killed in the conflict

The report is expected to be critical of the actions of key Labour figures in the months before the Iraq War 

The revelations are a major blow to hopes that the inquiry, which began work in 2009, would finally publish its report before the election next May.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood is said to have warned the inquiry that the report, which is expected to be critical of Mr Blair and some senior Labour figures, should be published by the end of January to avoid interfering with the election.

He is thought to have set an absolute deadline of early March, after which time the report would have to be delayed to prevent it becoming a political football during the election campaign.

The development will dismay families of the 179 British soldiers killed in the bloody conflict who have waited years to discover the real reasons their loved ones were sent to war.

Some have already branded the inquiry a ‘whitewash’, after it emerged that it will not be allowed to publish full details of 25 letters Mr Blair sent to George W Bush or the transcripts of 130 phone calls between the two men.

In them, Mr Blair is said to have promised the US President unconditional support for the war, telling him: ‘You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I’m with you.’

Sir Jeremy ruled in May this year that only the ‘gist’ of these conversations could be published.

The deal, which followed two-and-a-half years of wrangling, was seen as a breakthrough that might finally allow the report to be published.

But, to the dismay of some in Whitehall, Sir John has continued to make fresh requests to publicise sensitive information, each of which takes weeks to consider.

There is also mounting speculation that Sir John is struggling to balance the views of the inquiry panel on some key issues, suggesting that his report may not be completed for months.

A spokesman for the inquiry confirmed that the legal process in which figures like Mr Blair will be given the chance to respond to criticism has not yet started. This process is expected to take at least two months and must be completed before the report can be released.

Sir Jeremy acknowledged last week that there had been a ‘delay of sorts’ while thousands of requests to declassify documents were considered.

But he insisted there would not be a cover-up.

Giving evidence to MPs he said: ‘I am absolutely confident that the report will be as transparent as it needs to be.

‘I can understand people’s frustration but I think the report will be more transparent than you are expecting, and I don’t think in any shape or form it can be called a cover-up

June 15, 2009: Prime Minister Gordon Brown announces inquiry led by Sir John Chilcot ‘to consider the period from the summer of 2001 to the end of July 2009, embracing the run-up to the conflict in Iraq, the military action and its aftermath’.

November 24, 2009: First public hearings.

January 29, 2010: Tony Blair gives evidence. Says he has no regrets about removing Saddam. Booed as he leaves.

February 2, 2011: Final public hearing. Former foreign secretary Jack Straw says UK never had a policy of regime change.

November 16, 2011: Report’s release put back until at least the summer of 2012 following a dispute with the Cabinet Office over the use of classified documents, including Mr Blair’s private messages to President Bush in the run-up to the war.

July 16, 2012: Sir John says the report will not be published before the middle of 2013 because no decision had been reached on which documents should be released.

November 7, 2013: Sir John suggests publication could be delayed indefinitely by row over over 130 new transcripts of conversations between Brown, Blair and Bush.

May 16, 2014: David Cameron says he hopes for publication by end of the year.

May 27, 2014: Mr Blair insists he is not the reason for the hold-up, saying he wants to hear the findings so he can defend himself.

May 29, 2014: Deal reached for extracts of exchanges between Blair and Bush to be published – but full texts will remain secret.

September 14, 2014: Whitehall sources say Sir John is still requesting classified documents from civil servants, as it emerges legal letters to key Labour figures are yet to be sent. It is now unlikely the report will be published before the 2015 General Election.
