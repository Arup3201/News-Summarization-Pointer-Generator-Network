Pop star Lee Ryan was excused crown court jury duty - after the presiding judge asked him: 'Don’t I know you?'

The Blue star, whose hits include the group's May 2001 UK number four single All Rise, was selected as the eighth juror on a 12-person panel to listen to evidence against a defendant facing assault charges during a three-day trial.

However, as the singer was about to take his seat in the jury box, Judge Mary Jane Mowat, sitting at Oxford Crown Court, said: 'I believe I know this gentleman.'

The 28-year-old said casually: 'If you like music you might have done. I haven’t been to court or anything.'

To which the judge replied: 'I was thinking more about horses.'

After a brief pause, Mr Ryan, who is known to have ridden in the past, pointed at the judge and said: 'Oh yeah.'

'I would ask that you please stand down,' added Judge Mowat.

Blond Mr Ryan, dressed in a denim jacket, tee-shirt, jeans and green trainers, then rose, looking somewhat pleased as he turned around and walked to the back of the courtroom.

Mr Ryan, who rose to fame in 2001, lives in nearby Yarnton near Oxford, which was why he was selected for jury service.

Six men and six women were chosen to sit on the case of Amar Khan, aged 27, of Windrush Drive, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

Khan was charged with unlawful wounding with intent and an alternative charge of unlawful wounding, as well as two counts of assault by beating after the attack in Cowley, Oxon, on July 15 last year.

Prosecutor Jonathon Stone told the hearing that the defendant was part of a gang of four men who burst into a mother-of-three’s home and demand she hand over drugs.

It was alleged Khan used a claw hammer to hit Charlotte Marshall’s boyfriend Ade Adeniran over the head in a bloody attack, which left him needing stitches.

The gang made their getaway empty-handed, but Khan was the only suspect police caught, the hearing was told.

His fingerprints were found in a silver Citron car used as the getaway vehicle.

A Tesco receipt found in the car placed him near to the scene just 20 minutes before the assault.

Khan admits being in the car but not during the time of the attack.

The case continues.
