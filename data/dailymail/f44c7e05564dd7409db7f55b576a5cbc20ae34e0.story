Peter Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time even though they face a humiliating early exit from the World Cup if they lose here on Monday against Bangladesh.

Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup.

They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them.

But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job.

'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better.

'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment – to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament.

'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.'

Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him.

'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't.

'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player.

'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing.

'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.'

England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished.

'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.'

If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him.

England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler.

'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.'

There was also discouragement for his old bête noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket.

'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.
