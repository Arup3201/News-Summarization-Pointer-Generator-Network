Wojciech Szczesny refuses to abandon Arsenal's title hopes after spirits were lifted at the Emirates Stadium by a Christmas revival.

Szczesny revealed how Arsene Wenger's team had trained their focus on a short-term target of nine points from three games in seven days and are two thirds of the way there.

Victory at Southampton on Thursday will hoist them above the Saints and into the top four at the start of a month when Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey are expected to be back from injury and the transfer market opens for business.

'When you start the season you always want to win the championship,' said Szczesny. 'That is the only thought in our heads. But with the position that we' re in, we have to look at short-term goals.

'We said before the run of Christmas games we wanted nine points. We have six so far, so we go to Southampton with confidence to get three points. They won't be short of confidence either after a good result against Chelsea.

'Of course we want to catch up on Chelsea and Manchester City. But for now we have to climb up the table and see if we can put pressure on them.'

Arsenal have won only nine of their first 19 games and are 13 points adrift of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, but Wenger and his players were encouraged by the spirit on display during the 2-1 win at West Ham on Sunday.

'We had to dig deep against by far the strongest West Ham side I've ever played against,' said Szczesny. 

'It was quite ugly in the end but we got through. They put a lot of balls in the box so it has to be ugly. We had to defend and put our bodies on the line.

'The centre-backs headed so many balls and made so many blocks. No-one will give them stick on Match of the Day for that performance and I am happy because they do get criticised sometimes.'

Wenger needs defensive reinforcements and is planning a January swoop for West Ham's Winston Reid, who is soon out of contract, but much of Arsenal's solidity depends on Laurent Koscielny, who was back alongside Per Mertesacker for the game at Upton Park.

'He is as good as you're going to get in England,' said Szczesny. 'When he is fit and plays with Per, they make a great couple of the centre backs. Having them together is great for us. Hopefully he can continue to play and to be clear of injury.'
