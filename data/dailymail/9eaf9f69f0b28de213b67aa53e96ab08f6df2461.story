It's one of the most important parts of watching your child develop.

And one dad decided he was going to film every step of the way - literally.

Nick Turner, of New York, decided to set up a camera and film his daughter's daily attempts to try and walk.

Lucy, Turner's third child, has now become the internet's cute star of the week thanks to a time lapse video of her journey.

First attempt: A cute new video shows one-year-old Lucy Turner's journey to taking her first steps

Slow start: To begin with Lucy needs much assistance

Getting stronger: But soon she develops the courage to try on her own

Support: Some help from the big sister always helps

Family: And a hand from the big brother is also good, too

Well on her way: Lucy is all smiles as she stands on her own

Winner's grin: At the end of the cute clip, Lucy masters the art of walking

'The process lasted months ... as you can see from the holiday decorations appearing and disappearing in the background,' Turner told HLN TV.

'Maybe it was two and a half months total.'

In five days since it was uploaded to YouTube the cute clip has amassed over 65,000 views.

'Everyone seems to love the video, and I hope Lucy appreciates it someday,' Turner added.
