Regrets: Carolyn Lazarus wishes she had never quit her job

Recently, seething after a blistering row with my husband Marc, I plotted my escape from our marriage.

I imagined packing a case and taking our children Chad, 16, and Daisy, 13, to a hotel. 

It’s a scenario I’ve played out numerous times in the aftermath of a marital humdinger but never actually made it a reality.

Why? Well, mostly because Marc and I do still love each other. But also, because I couldn’t afford to leave if I wanted to.

It’s a situation in which I have felt trapped and one that sometimes leaves me frustrated and angry. I’m sure many of my affluent friends, who are also stay-at-home mothers, share my misery. But it’s something none of us dare express for fear of being labelled ungrateful.

After all, women like me are living every female’s dream. Aren’t we? With two happy, healthy children who gleefully greet me at the school gate each evening, a beautiful home and a supportive, successful husband, I know how lucky I am.

But, before you pour scorn on me, please understand that I have come to this situation from a very unusual starting point: I gave up a successful, £80,000-a-year career as a commercial lawyer to become a full-time mother and housewife.

I did this even though for the early part of our marriage, I earned significantly more than Marc. And, hard as it is to admit, ever since I gave up my job 13 years ago and accepted the household would be run with Marc’s salary, I’ve felt rather empty.

While Marc is kind, generous and constantly assures me that it is our money not his I abhor the fact that I’ve allowed myself to lose my financial independence.

As much as being present for every violin concert and sports day has filled me with pride, and as much as my children have benefited from having me as a constant in their lives, I can’t help but feel that the price of their happiness was my own.

And every time I spot a groomed 
career woman in her crisp Pink shirt and Reiss suit, I feel a stab of 
envy, then guilt, as I creep back home to the detritus of domesticity.

Because,
 even though I know how it feels to be an exhausted working mother, 
having worked in the years after Chad was born, back then at least I had
 a sense of purpose. Motherhood may be a privilege, but it simply cannot
 replace the confidence I lost when I gave up my job.

I
 look back at how Marc and I met as students at Chester Law College in 
1981 when we were both 21 and know that the younger me would never have 
imagined the future that transpired.

I’d just graduated with a degree in 
law from Sheffield University. Our jobs took us to London where we both 
worked in the City. Before long, we bought our first home.

While
 Marc opted for litigation, I delved into the lucrative world of 
commercial law. I used to regularly take Concorde to New York or fly 
first class to India, Tokyo, Canada and California to sign off deals for
 my firms’ clients, mostly pharmaceutical giants. I was frequently the 
only woman in the boardroom.

Even after our marriage in 1989, 
children seemed a long way off. But, in 1994, my younger sister Janet 
had a baby. As I held her daughter for the first time, her pudgy little 
fingers clasping my thumb, I instantly knew I wanted one, too. Looking 
at Marc, joyously cradling his newborn niece in his arms, I knew he felt
 the same.

We were both overjoyed when I fell pregnant in 1996, when we were both 38. I worked until two weeks before the birth.

Chad
 was born in May 1997 and within a few months I couldn’t wait to get 
back to work, confident I could juggle baby and boardroom. I was back at
 my desk in November. Three months later I left for a nine-day business 
trip to Tokyo.

Marc was
 actually very supportive of my decision to go. He knew how exhausting 
I’d found juggling child and boardroom and saw the trip as me getting a 
bit of a break. His mother stayed at our house to care for Chad. 
Business class travel and luxury hotels were a welcome respite from 
nappies and baby food.

But when I returned home, Marc was 
cradling Chad on his shoulder, and my baby boy had a sad look on his 
little face that I’ll never forget. And I was racked with guilt.

Over
 the next 15 months, Chad’s grip on my heartstrings tightened. I dreaded
 the daily farewell at nursery, prising his tiny hands from my neck. At 
work, guilt and fatigue made it difficult to concentrate.

Keen to extend our family, I was delighted when I became pregnant again the following year.

But this pregnancy — and two more 
quickly followed — demonstrated how little control I now had over my 
body and circumstances: I suffered three miscarriages within nine 
months, the last while I was sitting in a meeting in London.

Distraught,
 I rang Marc on the train home and told him I was going to quit my job. 
Put simply, I couldn’t take any more — the demands were too great.

Marc
 was calm and reassuring. I handed in my resignation the next day. 
Looking back, I’m incredulous that this was the extent of the 
discussion. Secretly I suspect Marc was relieved that he would, finally 
be the breadwinner.

Happy times: Carolyn's marriage fell under strain following her decision to leave her job

Although my success and salary 
genuinely never caused a problem between us, he’d had a very traditional
 upbringing with men being providers and protectors.

Two
 months later, Daisy was conceived. Keen to embrace my role as a 
full-time mum, in August 1999 we moved to a farmhouse in Herefordshire 
to be close to my parents.

Daisy
 was born in April 2000 and initially I took to full-time motherhood 
gleefully, relishing the time with my children, and not having to 
express milk before going to the office. But Marc was either working 
12-hour days or staying in hotels near his office and I missed him 
terribly. Days dragged interminably.

Around
 the same time, we were invited to a dinner party. I was sitting next to
 a rather pretentious stockbroker who asked me what I did. I said I was 
at home with the children and watched his eyes glaze. Previously he was 
the kind of man I would have relished putting in his place in the 
boardroom — now I felt cowed by him.

'Although my success and salary genuinely
 never caused a problem between us, he’d had a very traditional 
upbringing with men being providers and protectors'

When we moved to our current home in 2004, a converted tile factory with four vast bedrooms and a self-contained annexe — now worth around £1 million — several friends commented that ‘Marc’s obviously doing well’. I smarted. It was as if I’d contributed nothing.

I tried part-time voluntary work, working as a tour guide for an exhibition at Hereford Cathedral, and as a magistrate when Daisy was at school. But my agonising insecurity chipped away at our marriage, by now beset with resentments over money and our roles.

My easy-going husband started to feel the pressure of being the breadwinner, and during our escalating arguments, his ‘quips’ about my days, playing tennis and hosting coffee mornings, began to grate.

I know Marc wondered where the joyous woman he married had gone. But, as he’s never had to take a day out of his career when the kids have been ill, or ever known how it feels not to have his own money, how could he understand?

I remind him — usually during a row — that had I still been a lawyer, I’d be earning around £200,000 a year now. Far more than him. I know I do this to score points, but I just can’t help myself.

Ironically, the only time I have no qualms about spending Marc’s money is after a row, usually in the boutiques in Cheltenham.

Family life has improved following Carolyn's decision to start up her own website

Five years ago, we resorted to marriage guidance counselling. The counsellor instantly pointed out that I was bored, unstimulated and reliant on Marc. Even his insistence that the money is ‘ours’ cannot shake off the feeling that he is funding my life, which can make me feel little more than a chaffeur or a cleaner.

He now regrets the fact that we never made plans for me to return to work once both children were at school — for all our sakes.

So, 18 months ago, I set up a website called totally4women, for women like me. This should hopefully save our poor husbands from the brunt of our frustration. The website has already broken even and is on the cusp of earning a small income from sponsorship. And yes, I’m smiling more.

Even though my children know I used to have a successful career, I want them to see my work ethic for themselves. I regularly implore Daisy not to completely give up her career if she is one day lucky enough to have children.

The greatest lesson I have learned is that a happy wife and mum equals a happy household. For that reason alone, I wish I’d found a way to return to work, even part-time.

I adore my children, and am proud of the childhood I’ve been able to give them. But I miss the old ‘me’ every day.  Interview by Sadie Nicholas
