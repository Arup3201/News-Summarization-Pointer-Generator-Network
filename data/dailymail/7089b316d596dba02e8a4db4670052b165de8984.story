Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to bring in tough new curbs on strikes in 'essential' services if the tories win the next election

The Tories will bring in tough new curbs on strikes in ‘essential’ services if they win the next election, David Cameron pledged yesterday.

The Prime Minister said he intends to introduce a minimum threshold on the number of employees who must take part in a ballot on  industrial action before it can trigger a strike.

He said he had been held back from introducing a threshold of this type since he took office in 2010 because of opposition from Liberal Democrats in the Coalition Government.

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio London: ‘Of course there is a right to strike in our country. But in essential services, isn’t it worth saying that there ought to be a threshold, a certain percentage of people who have to take part before a strike is called that does so much damage?’

‘This is not something I can deliver in Coalition. Our Liberal 
Democrat coalition partners don’t seem keen on this, for whatever 
reason. But I am keen on it, and a new Conservative Government would 
deal with that.’

He did not outline which types of industrial action could come under the remit of the new rules.

A Number 10 source said no decisions had yet been taken, and it was not known at what level the turnout threshold would be set.

But campaigners have called for a minimum threshold to be introduced for the railways, the fire service, the NHS and schools.

However Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, responded: ‘If 50 per cent of those eligible to vote becomes the new test of 
democratic legitimacy, not a single MP including Mr Cameron passes the 
test.

‘Few would argue that the outcome of a general election is a
 lot more important than the result of any strike ballot. We cannot have
 abstentions added to no votes to count as a no vote in a strike ballot 
and totally ignored in the more important ballot vote to elect our 
Parliament.

‘Workers’ rights are already severely constrained and
 curtailing the right to strike even more is simply neither acceptable 
nor democratic.’

David Cameron, pictured giving a talk in Gloucestershire, said he intends to introduce a minimum threshold on the number of employees who must take part in a ballot on  industrial action before it can trigger a strike

Speaking at a question and answer session in Stroud, Gloucestershire, on
 Thursday, Mr Cameron said: ‘When strikes take place that are hugely 
disruptive to other people’s lives, they should at least have the 
support of a good share of the members of that trade union.

‘I’m looking at if we can change that for the future, because I think a strike should be the last weapon that people use.

‘People
 should be talking, people should be negotiating. In some of these cases
 people have opted for a strike far too quickly and we need to change 
that.’ 

London mayor Boris 
Johnson has demanded a threshold to be set so that a strike cannot be 
held unless at least 50 per cent of all eligible union members vote in 
favour.

Tory MP Dominic Raab, who has campaigned for strike thresholds, said: ‘We need this reform to make sure militant hardliners lacking majority support from rank and file members can’t hold the hard-working public to ransom with outlandish demands.

‘The public back this proposal by three to one, but yet again the Lib Dems have blocked a common-sense measure most would welcome.’

The comments come after a disruptive strike on the London Underground at the end of last month.
