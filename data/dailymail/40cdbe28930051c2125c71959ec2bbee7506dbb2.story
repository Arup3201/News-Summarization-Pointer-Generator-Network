Russell Slade has resigned as manager of Leyton Orient, paving the way for him to become the new boss of Cardiff City.

The Bluebirds had three approaches rebuffed by the Brisbane Road side for permission to open talks with Slade.

But Vincent Tan’s move to land his No 1 target took a new twist when Slade tendered his resignation to the Orient board early on Wednesday evening.

Russell Slade has quit Leyton Orient and a move to Cardiff for the 53-year-old now looks imminent 

His decision means the Bluebirds can forge ahead with their wish to appoint Slade as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s full-time successor.

Orient released a short statement on their official website.

It read: 'The Chairman and the CEO of Leyton Orient have received a resignation letter from Russell Slade a few minutes ago. 

'This has not happened by chance after the Club rejected this afternoon, a proposal from the General Manager of Cardiff City regarding the transfer of Russell Slade. The lawyers of the Club are now studying the file.'

After the success of last season, Orient have struggled in the new campaign and currently sit 17th in the table.
