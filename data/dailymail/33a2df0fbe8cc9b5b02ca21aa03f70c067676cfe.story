Another actor has come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of attempted sexual assault.

Michelle Hurd, the actress best known for her roles on Low & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, says she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting increasingly inappropriate around her, saying, 'NEVER tell anyone what we [do] together.'

What's more, she states that at least one person on set woke up at his apartment drugged on one occasion.

Coming forward: Michelle Hurd (above) is the latest actress to come forward detailing her experience with Bill Cosby

Not right: Hurd, who starred on Law & Order: SVU (above) says that Cosby touch her inappropriately on the set of The Cosby Show, but she turned him down when he asked her to shower

Same story again: Ten women have come forward in the past month claiming they were at some point assaulted by Cosby (above)

Hurd bravely decided to share her story on Facebook.

'LOOK, I wasn’t going to say anything, but I can’t believe some of the things i’ve been reading, SO here is MY personal experience,' she begins.

'I did stand-in work on The Cosby show back in the day and YES, Bill Cosby was VERY inappropriate with me.'

She goes on to discuss being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room.

Then, things got to be too much for Hurd.

'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 

'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, "No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened”.'

Unacceptable: Hurd shared that another stand-in who worked on The Cosby Show (above) did wake up at Cosby's apartment drugged

Private person with no reason to lie: Hurd is a notoriously private actor, keeping even the date of her marriage to fellow actor Garret Dillahunt (above) out of the press

That unfortunately was not the case for another actress who Hurd began trading stories with on set.

'Turns out he was doing the same thing to her, almost by the numbers, BUT, she did go to his house and because I will not name her, and it is her story to tell, all I’ll say is she awoke, after being drugged, vomited, and then Cosby told her there’s a cab waiting for you outside.' 

Hurd, who is married to fellow actor Garret Dillahunt and so private that no one even knows their wedding date, then stresses that she has no reason whatsoever to lie about what happened.

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.

Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee.

Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

Andrea Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. 

Meanwhile, Cosby's laywer, Martin Singer, has released a statement calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.'

'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer. 

'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?'

He then closes by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'

Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions.

Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her.

Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967.

What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.'

The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.

Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.

This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?

It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop. 

These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star.

TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network. 

Despite all this, Cosby did perform in the Bahamas on Thursday and in Florida on Friday. 

His upcoming standup shows in Las Vegas and Arizona have however been cancelled.
