In the aftermath of Lionel Messi's masterclass, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini repeated that he does not fear losing his job at the end of the season. 

But with the ruthless Chelsea machine far in the Premier League distance and no chance of silverware from cup competitions, the Chilean's ageing, expensively-assembled side look certain to end the campaign trophyless - a relative drought that will not go down well in the desert residence of the club's owners.

Here, Sportsmail looks at five men who could replace Pellegrini in the Etihad hot seat in the summer should he be given the boot.

Manuel Pellegrini could be dismissed as Manchester City boss with the club facing a trophyless season

1. Frank de Boer

With four Dutch titles in a row under his belt the Ajax supremo is the most attainable of the candidates in the running.

The innovative 44-year-old introduced youth and creativity to an ageing, underperforming side and would appear to fit the bill.

However, City are famously looking for Champions League progression and three group stage exits in a row in Amsterdam may undermine his case.

That said, De Boer would have resources at City he could only dream about with Ajax. Do not rule out a Dutch dynasty in Manchester.

2. Pep Guardiola

The Bayern Munich boss is well-known to City executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain from their time together at the Nou Camp and would appear to be the obvious choice.

Begiristain, City's director of football, held that role at Barcelona while Guardiola was coach and the men are close friends. 

Guardiola himself has spoken of his desire to coach in England. Timing however, is the issue.

The 44-year-old's contract in Bavaria does not expire until next summer and he has already ruled out leaving before then. 

Interestingly that coincides with the end of Pellegrini's deal at the Etihad...

3. Diego Simeone

The Argentine's stock went through the roof after last season's logic-defying La Liga title and Champions League final appearance. 

A defence of that title looks unlikely but by qualifying for the Champions League quarter-finals the Man in Black has delivered another work of fantasy.

With Real Madrid and Barcelona retaining their rights to plunder most of the money from TV rights, an exit born of frustration may well have been on the cards.

But Simeone's sister and representative Natalia dismissed talk of a move away, stating that her sibling was close to signing a new deal at the Vicente Calderon where he is loved like no other.

4. Carlo Ancelotti

Odds on the veteran Italian swapping Madrid for Manchester could shorten as early as this weekend, when his men take on Barcelona in El Clasico.

Lose and it could be two years in a row without a La Liga crown, which is not acceptable for the Bernabeu masses. 

Win, and with a Champions League quarter-final to come, Ancelotti may not be going anywhere.

5. Patrick Vieira

There is little doubt that the Arsenal legend will one day be gunning for the top job at City. 

Vieira has impressed during his stint in charge of City's youngsters after inheriting a shambles.

He makes the right noises, is loved by his players and is respected within the club. 

Vieira is young and ambitious but currently lacks the experience needed for the role. Expect him to be the man who replaces the man who replaces Pellegrini.
