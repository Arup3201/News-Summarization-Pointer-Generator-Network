Jules Bianchi’s father has revealed there is no change in his son’s condition as he continues to fight for his life in hospital.

Bianchi’s brother Tom and his sister Melanie arrived at the Mie University Hospital late on Thursday where the Frenchman is being treated for a severe head trauma sustained in last weekend's rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix.

His British-based team confirmed earlier on Friday that they will only enter one car for this weekend’s inaugural race in Russia out of respect to the 25-year-old and his family.

Philippe Bianchi, who revealed he hasn’t watched any footage of his son’s crash which happened in the closing stages of the Suzuka race, said the driver remains in a critical condition.

‘Jules is fighting as he always did, the same way as if he was racing. He is strong,’ Bianchi Snr said.

‘There are no significant changes. Everyone knows that he is in a critical phase.’

Bianchi was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury to the brain – whereby damage is widespread rather than localised in one particular area – after he ploughed into a recovery vehicle sent out to retrieve Adrian Sutil’s Sauber during the latter stages of Sunday's race.

The prognosis is not good as such injuries often result in coma, and if severe, 90 per cent of patients never regain consciousness.

‘I do not want to see the video,’ Bianchi’s father, who was speaking to French newspaper Nice Matin, added. ‘It is difficult to speak of a racing incident. To me, it's more like a traffic accident.’

The Formula One paddock has paid tribute to Bianchi with all the drivers carrying the message 'Tous avec Jules' (All with Jules) on their helmets, along with his race number of 17.
