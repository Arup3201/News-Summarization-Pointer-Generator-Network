It's not just the players of both Europe and the USA that will be in the spotlight at Gleneagles.

Having very much become an integral part of the Ryder Cup weekend, the cameras will no doubt be on the wives and girlfriends marching alongside the Scottish fairways.

And of those shouting loud and proud, the leader of the pack will surely be Hunter Mahan's wife Kandi, a former NFL cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys.

Kandi Mahan, a former cheerleader with the Dallas Cowboys and wife of USA star Hunter, will lead the support for the States at Gleneagles this weekend

Kandi and world No 6 Hunter met in December 2009 and it took just six months for him to pop the question before they married in Dallas in January 2011.

Mrs Mahan gave birth to the couple's first child Zoe Olivia in August 2013, with Hunter withdrawing midway through the Canadian Open to be with his wife. 

On Wednesday night, the WAGs will be at the Ryder Cup Gala concert at the SSE Hydro Arena, hosted by James Nesbitt and Edith Bowman and will feature performances by Jake Bugg, Midge Ure, Nile Rodgers, Amy Macdonald alongside the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Opera and the Scottish Ballet. Fred McAuley will interview Paul McGinley and Tom Watson, the two Ryder Cup captains.

The WAGs will attend the opening ceremony, which takes place on Thursday afternoon between the Gleneagles Hotel and the club house.

They will also be at the closing ceremony on the 18th hole on Sunday.

The WAGs will be strategically placed around the course to encourage their partners on all three days of competition.
