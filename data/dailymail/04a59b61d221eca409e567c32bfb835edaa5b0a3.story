A giant fluorescent pink slug and a cannibal snail have been discovered in a remote part of Australia.

The pink slug grows up to 20 centimetres long, while the carnivore snail preys on its vegetarian relatives. 

Both bizarre creatures live around Mount Kaputar near Narrabri in New South Wales - around 323 miles northwest of Sydney.

The unique giant fluorescent pink slug Triboniophorous graeffei found only in the misty Mount Kaputar area of New South Wales, Australia. It grows around 20 centrimetres long and feeds on moss. It is a relative of the Red Triangle slug found in other areas of New South Wales and Queensland

Mount Kaputar is a mountain near Narrabri in northern New South Wales.

It is situated around 323 miles northwest of Sydney.

It stands at 1,508 metres, is part of the Nandewar Range and has been preserved within the Mount Kaputar National Park.

It is the remnants of an extinct volcano that was active about 18 million years ago. 

Most of the vegetation on the mountain is dry forest yet there are small pockets of damp rainforest-style environments where unique creatures such as the pink slug and cannibal snail live. 

During winter months the region can get long periods of heavy rainfall as well as dusting of snow near the mountain's summit.

Locals have long reported sightings of the bizarre pink slug, especially after heavy rainfall, yet taxonomists have only recently confirmed it is the same species as the red triangle slug, officially known as Triboniophorus graeffi.

These pinks slugs are thought to date back to Gondwana, the name given to two continents that formed part of the Pangaea supercontinent which existed between 180 million years ago.

These two landmasses formed to create what is now known as Australia.

The giant Triboniophorus graeffi slug (left), and the cannibal 
snail (right) are both thought to be unique to the Mount Kaputar region 
of New South Wales. The slugs 
feed on moss and are usually spotted after periods of heavy rainfall, 
whereas the snails eat other vegetarian land snails that live in the 
remote region

The slug lives in an area about six 
miles long by six miles wide and is unique to the mountaintop region, 
although relatives can be found in New Zealand and South Africa.

The
cannibal snail is also thought to be unique to the Mount Kaputar 
region and only eats other vegetable land snails that also live in the area.

Both are thought to have originated in eastern Australia when it was made up of damp rainforests.

Following a volcano eruption around 
17 million years ago the area began to dry out and only small pockets of
rainforest-style environments remained.

This restricted the areas where these 
invertebrates could live.

Michael
Murphy, who has been a national parks ranger in the region for 20 years, 
told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'It's a tiny island of alpine forest, 
hundreds of kilometres away from 
anything else like it.

Forests on the northwest slopes of Mount Kaputar near Narrabri in New South Wales. Its vegetation is mainly dry, although areas of rainforest remain and heavy rainfall makes it the ideal location for the pink slug and cannibal snail to live

The slugs, for example, are buried in the leaf 
mould during the day, but sometimes at night they come out in their 
hundreds and feed off the mould and moss on the trees.

They are amazing,
unreal-looking creatures.'

The slug is just one of the rare inhabitants of the misty region of Mount Kaputar that is also synonymous with flowering snow gum plants and native vines.

Because of these rare and unique creatures, the New South Wales Scientific committee has recently made a preliminary decision to list the site as an 'endangered ecological community'.

This means it has the highest level of protection from intrusion and development. 

The committee's report said: 'These species have evolved from lowland ancestors and have been isolated in an otherwise snail-hostile environment as conditions began to dry.

'As a result, they are ''acutely susceptible'' to human-induced climate change.

Temperatures a degree or two higher would dry out their mountaintop.'
