Dr Peter Carter, head of the Royal College of Nursing, was forced to defend his remarks

Relatives should go into hospitals to help staff care for the elderly, according to a nursing leader.

Dr Peter Carter, head of the Royal 
College of Nursing, said families should be encouraged to assist 
patients during mealtimes and take them to the toilet.

He also wants hospitals to end restricted visiting times so relatives can stay as long as they want.

Dr Carter warned that on some wards there were too few nurses to help all frail patients eat their meals or go to the toilet.

He said: ‘If you have a 24-bed ward 
and have got five nurses and everybody is having lunch at the same time 
and half the patients need feeding, it becomes difficult to get it all 
done.

‘If someone is coming in and sitting 
with their loved one, they are going to have the focused dedicated time.
You get this business of wards, very, very busy people, patients dying 
to go to the loo, elderly patients wetting themselves, then they lie 
there feeling embarrassed – and it is about helping gran get out and go 
to the loo.’

Figures show the average ‘care of the 
elderly’ ward has just one nurse for 11 patients – substantially fewer 
than in other parts of many hospitals.

A report by the RCN last year found 
nurses on these wards were looking after an average of three more 
patients compared with children’s wards, for example.

Only last week Dr Carter warned that 
nurses were beginning their career unable to care for patients as they 
spend too much time in lecture halls.

He also said untrained healthcare 
assistants with no medical qualifications now carry out many tasks once 
reserved for nurses, such as helping patients to eat and drink, cleaning
bedsores and taking blood samples.

Dr Carter has asked the Royal College of Nursing to consider ways to encourage more families to help out on wards.

‘If patients are in hospital then it is hospital staff who surely have a duty of care to look after patients’ needs such as feeding them and ensuring they are clean, washed and dry’

‘The NHS is just not going to deal 
with it. Neither are social services,’ he said. ‘You have got to get 
maximum family involvement.

‘The services need to gear themselves 
up to make people aware: You are very welcome to come in and look after 
mum, dad, husband and wife.’

Many hospitals will allow relatives to visit only during the afternoon, for example from 2pm to 8pm.

And many have ‘protective mealtimes’ 
which ban visitors coming to the ward whilst food is being served in 
case it distracts patients from eating.

But Dr Carter wants visiting times to be more flexible, particularly during mealtimes so families can help patients eat.

His views are backed up by Dr Clare 
Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, who said the NHS could not
afford to employ staff to sit with the elderly for hours on end.

‘Families
should be more involved,’ she said. ‘Can we afford to have someone 
sitting by an elderly person in hospital and feeding them, which might 
take two or three hours.’

But Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, the over-50s group, said the suggestion was ‘astonishing’.

‘If patients are in hospital then it 
is hospital staff who surely have a duty of care to look after patients’
needs such as feeding them and ensuring they are clean, washed and 
dry,’ she said.

Official NHS figures show that last year 214,888 patients were discharged from hospital with some form of malnutrition.

The Care Quality Commission watchdog this year found that in some hospitals the elderly were going without food for several days.

This means their immune systems will be far weaker and they are less able to cope with potentially fatal illnesses such as flu and pneumonia.

Lacking calcium and vitamin D, they will be prone to osteoporosis and  associated hip fractures and other broken bones.

Some hospitals now employ volunteer feeders – members of the public who come in during meal times to help patients too frail to eat.
