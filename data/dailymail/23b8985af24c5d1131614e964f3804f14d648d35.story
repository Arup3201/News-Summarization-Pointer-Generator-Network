Prime Minister David Cameron described the proposed 11% pay hike as 'unthinkable'

An obligatory £7,600 pay rise is expected to be given to MPs this week – despite the furious objections of all three party leaders.

The Commons pay watchdog is expected to cause public outrage by pressing ahead with an 11 per cent hike, which David Cameron previously described as ‘unthinkable’.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will sign off on an increase in MPs’ salaries from £66,396 to £74,000 – and try to defuse criticism by toughening its crackdown on perks such as taxis and hotels.

But even though Nick Clegg has said that MPs should decide themselves whether to take the increase, and Ed Miliband has vowed to cancel it if he wins the next Election, the watchdog made clear last night that MPs would not be able to turn down the rise.

‘It is automatic,’ a source explained. ‘If they want to, they can give it to a stray cats home, that’s up to them.’

Under the system set up in response to the expenses scandal, MPs no longer have the right to vote on – or veto – what IPSA recommends.

The watchdog first floated the idea of the rise in July, saying it should take effect at the start of the next Parliament in 2015.

Mr Clegg said at the time that people would find it ‘impossible to understand’ when living standards were being ‘remorselessly squeezed’, while Mr Miliband said that if he became Prime Minister he would limit the wage increase to one per cent, which amounts to about £660 a year.

However, after a four-month consultation – including about 200 responses from MPs – IPSA is expected to throw down the gauntlet by sticking to its recommendation of an increase.

To limit the fallout, IPSA is likely to propose that the £4.6 million cost of the increase is offset by an intensification of its crackdown on perks.

That would include less generous 
pensions, lower payoffs when MPs lose their seats and tight restrictions
on free taxis, evening meal allowances and hotel stays – unless they 
are booked very late at night.

Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said people would find the rise 'impossible to understand' at a time when most are being 'remorselessly squeezed'

Asked last night whether Mr Cameron would order his MPs to give up the rise, a senior Conservative source would only say: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear he is committed to reducing the cost of politics and that there should be restraint.’

A Labour spokesman said: ‘Any rise in MPs’ pay must be considered in the light of the current economic climate and the cost-of-living crisis facing people across the country,’ while Lib Dem sources suggested a review of the pay hike by IPSA after the Election.

However, Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, backed a pay increase – though he questioned elements of the perks crackdown.

‘IPSA is an independent body which will come to its own decision on pay,’ said Mr Walker. ‘But the job of the MP requires them to work away from home and it is important that they should be able to travel safely after a late vote.’

Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle called for party leaders to stay out of the process. Mr Hoyle said the new system, whereby an independent body ruled on allowances, had to be respected.

He said: ‘I agree that MPs should not vote on their own pay. It should be left to an independent body. It’s not in the gift of the party leaders.’

IPSA declined to comment.
