Jamie Carragher has expressed his disbelief at Liverpool's lack of leadership and claims their capitulation at Crystal Palace is part of a wider problem at the club.

The former Reds central defender watched Brendan Rodgers' side blow a lead at Selhurst Park on Sunday. 

It means Liverpool have now won just two Premier League games since August and find themselves marooned in the bottom half.

And Carragher left no stoned unturned when dissecting the 3-1 defeat onSky Sports. 

'This is more than just a poor start - there's something wrong. Something isn't right,' he said. 'They are getting bullied out of games. Last year when they came here we said they were mentally and physically weak. Same again - nothing's changed.

‘You look at the time and there are no men in the team. Sometimes you’ve got to grind results out.

'Luis Suarez has gone... so what? Suarez has gone. There's no leadership on the pitch. As a Liverpool fan, which I am - I don't care about being neutral on TV - when you're watching your own team, the worst thing you can ever think is they're being bullied and weak.

'That's what we've seen today from Liverpool and it's not the first time. It's been going on all season and we're saying, "Oh, new players getting time to adjust." I'm not a big believer in that.

Martin Skrtel was criticised by Carragher for his handling of Palace striker Gayle late in the game 

'I've never moved clubs and I'm sure as a foreign player it takes a bit of time, but we're getting to the stage now where you want to start seeing performances.

'Liverpool aren't getting beat by quality - they're getting bullied. They've been beaten by enthusiasm there by Crystal Palace.

'You knew it was coming. Palace got the equaliser. As soon as that goal went in Liverpool didn't offer anything.

'We had that last season and it cost Liverpool the league. They conceded 50 goals last season and it hasn't been rectified. I'm very worried as a Liverpool fan.

'You're already looking at players and thinking Liverpool need four or five players.' 

Carragher was also disappointed at the way in which Martin Skrtel hauled down Dwight Gayle in the build-up to the decisive third goal. 

‘I played alongside Martin for a long time and he was doing that from day one,' he added. 'Skrtel shouldn’t be grabbing shirts. He’s actually known for it now throughout the league with the referees.

‘I think he’ll continue to do it until the day he retires.'
