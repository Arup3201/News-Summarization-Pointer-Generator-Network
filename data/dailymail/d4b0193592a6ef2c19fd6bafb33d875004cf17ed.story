England should accept it is too bad at football to compete and join a United Kingdom team instead, a Tory MP has said.

Laurence Robertson has called for a debate in the Commons on scrapping the England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland football teams in a bid to do better at the World Cup.

In the wake of England's first-round failure at the World Cup in Brazil the Tewkesbury MP said the football authorities from each nation should 'come together' to form one national team for the UK.

England's sole victory in 1966 shows the need to join up with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, claims Tory MP Laurence Robertson

Speaking outside the House of Commons, Mr Robertson said: 'It's my opinion we should have gone down that road a long time ago.

'None of us have really been successful - England have not done any good since 1966 and some great players from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not played in the World Cup, such as George Best and Ryan Giggs.

'That talent was lost on the international stage.'

Mr Robertson said he did not believe much could be done about the number of foreign players in the Premier League in England, as he said the nation should not 'deny ourselves the option to pick players from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales' to produce stronger sides.

He went on: 'Even in 1966 we could have had an even stronger side.

'In the past we would have been world-beaters - throughout the 1970s England failed to qualify twice and Scotland did qualify but failed to do any good.

England's best performance since 1966 was reaching the semi final in 1990.

'What's the point of four teams? I don't think any other country puts more than one team out - the United States doesn't put forward 50 teams.'

Mr Robertson added: 'When England get to the group stage and we cannot get out of it, I don't think we should accept that. I think we should try and improve.'

Alf Ramsey's England side beat West Germany 4-2 at Wembley to conquer the world but have since endured 48 years of hurt, culminating with the Three Lions securing a solitary point in Brazil and finishing bottom of their group behind Costa Rica, Uruguay and Italy.

Wales last appeared at the World Cup finals in 1958 - the last occasion when all four home nations played at the same tournament - while Northern Ireland last took part in 1986 and Scotland in 1998.

A Great Britain football team appeared at the London 2012 Olympics although only consisted of English and Welsh players.

The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Football Associations were opposed to a combined team entering in 2012 despite assurances from Fifa that it would not affect their independence as footballing nations.

Mr Robertson put forward the idea for the UK team in an early day motion before Parliament.

He says that 'no other nation fields more than one national team' and calls on the football authorities in each of the home countries to 'come together and form one national football team covering the UK'.

An EDM is a formal motion submitted for debate in the House of Commons although very few are actually debated.

Mr Robertson's EDM states in full: 'That this House notes with regret England's early exit from the 2014 World Cup; recalls that England has not won the World Cup since 1966; further notes that on three occasions since 1966 England has failed to qualify for the World Cup Finals at all, that Scotland has only qualified for eight World Cup Finals out of a total of 20, that Northern Ireland has only qualified for three and Wales has only qualified for one in 1958; believes that fielding four teams from the UK reduces the chances of success and has denied World Cup opportunities to outstanding British players; observes that no other nation fields more than one national team; and calls on the football authorities in each of the home countries to come together and form one national football team covering the UK.'
