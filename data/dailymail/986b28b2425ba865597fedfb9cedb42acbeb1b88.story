Michael Carrick says he will always class himself as a midfielder despite being called upon to shore up Manchester United’s defence.

The 33-year-old is highly regarded by manager Louis van Gaal and has been trusted to play as an auxiliary centre-back and  has cut an accomplished figure.

‘I class myself as a midfielder and probably always will,’ said Carrick. ‘I might have spells at centre-back, as I have over the last few years, but I’ve played for that long in midfield that I can’t class myself as anything other than a midfielder.’

However, as Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling are both still injured, Carrick may continue in defence for Saturday’s visit to Aston Villa.

‘You have to adapt because that’s just how things have gone in recent weeks,’ said Carrick.

‘Maybe when the injuries settle down and we have more of a settled squad then it will be more consistent in terms of positioning. But you have to be ready to deal with injuries. It’s happened a few times this season and, the more it does, the easier it gets.’

Carrick missed the first three months of the season after undergoing ankle surgery in July but since his comeback, United have lost once to Manchester City and won six successive games.

Talking to United Review and Inside United, Carrick said: ‘I feel good and I feel fresh. Obviously I missed a lot of football at the start of the season, but I’m enjoying it.

‘When you’re out for so long you really miss it, so I am just happy to be back playing and looking forward to the games ahead. You just try to play your own game.

Carrick also praised the impact that Antonio Valencia (centre) has had playing at full back for United

‘When you’re out for so long, you do think about how your return will go and it’s hard to judge where you’re at in terms of fitness and match sharpness, but things have gone alright.’

Carrick, meanwhile, has praised another versatile performer Antonio Valencia for his performances at full back.

‘Antonio is a pure athlete,’ said Carrick. ‘He is immense. It is the work he does that doesn’t get noticed, things like carrying the ball up the pitch for 30 or 40 yards when you have been defending.

‘He takes you up the pitch and defenders just back up because they know about his pace. If he can go down the line, then he is pretty hard to catch. He is a great team player and, when you are playing with him, you certainly appreciate that he is on your team.

‘He is pretty much the full package,’ added Carrick. ‘He is reserved but determined at the same time. He is quiet, he is pleasant and he is polite. He is not somebody who shouts and screams in the changing room but I certainly wouldn’t want to get on the wrong side of him.

‘He is stubborn and determined. He has got a real desire to win, like everyone at this club.’
