Basketball superstar Kobe Bryant has reportedly confirmed that he will leave the NBA after the 2015-2016 season.

The shooting guard, 36, who first entered the league in 1996, said that he will complete the two-year contract he signed in 2013 before ending his career, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

He will be paid more than $25million next year after ending the current season with the Los Angeles Lakers because of rotator cuff surgery.

Kobe Bryant (pictured left in 2013, right in 1997) has reportedly confirmed he will not play after the 2015-2016 season

Bryant's official Twitter account did not comment on The Hollywood Reporter story on Friday. 

The reveal about the end of his time in the NBA comes ahead of a documentary on the star's recovery from ankle problems by Gotham Chopra, Deepak Chopra's son.

He also said that he sometimes questions the amount of his life that he put into basketball at the expense of his relationships. 

The film looks at the star's recovery after injury woes that have plagued his last several seasons. 

Bryant played 35 games this year before his surgery in late January after missing almost all of the 2013-2014 campaign.

The 6'6'' star executive produced the documentary about himself, Kobe Bryant's Muse, and said the process was '100 per cent therapeutic'.

He had said during an hour-long interview with NBA TV that he was hoping for a 'rebirth' next year.

Team general manager Mitch Kupchak said last year that he believed the Pennsylvania native would retire in 2016. 

The Lakers, the only professional team Bryant has played for, are currently scraping the bottom of the barrel in the NBA standings at 13-40.

A second consecutive season without a spot in the playoffs would contrast sharply with the winning ways of previous Laker teams.

The purple and gold squad has won the NBA Championship five times with Bryant, who ranks third on the all-time NBA top scorers list.

Though his team is not expected to make the playoffs this year, he has won the NBA championship five times, including 2000 (left) 2001 (center), 2002, 2009 (right) and 2010

He also won two gold medals with the USA's Olympic squads in 2008 and 2012. 

Kobe Bryant's Muse, which airs February 28 on Showtime, also examines some of the darker parts of his life.

He was arrested in 2003 on sexual assault charges in Colorado before the case against him was eventually dropped.

The All-Star said that 'Those were dark days for all of us' and said making the movie was 'very difficult. But there's beauty in that process.'
