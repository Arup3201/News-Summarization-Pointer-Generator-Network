He says he is often absent-minded, will forget why he walked into a room and struggles to remember what is on his shopping list.

But Paul Hyland never forgets a face, and his unusual talent has seen him recruited as one of a new breed of crimefighters – a Scotland Yard ‘super-recogniser’.

Several years ago, police in London were on the lookout for a man wanted for nine burglaries. About a month after seeing the suspect’s picture, PC Hyland was stuck in traffic with two of his colleagues.

Never forgets a face: When police are trying to identify suspects from a crime Paul Hyland scans the surveillance footage before heading out on his normal police officer duties. The Met Police knows if he sees someone once, he never forgets a face

‘I looked up and noticed this guy coming out of a university and knew it was him,’ he said. He quickly arrested the suspect, who went on to confess to the burglaries.

He added: ‘If I’ve met someone before and see them again, I’ll usually know where I know them from, even if I can’t remember their name.’

But the 30-year-old officer said his incredible capacity to remember faces tends not to help him in his everyday life.

‘I’m quite forgetful with basic things,’ he said. ‘I’ll walk into a room and forget what I was coming in for, or I’ll drive to the shops and get a load of stuff except for what I was supposed to get. I’m not good with a shopping list.’

Met Police officers designated as Super 
Recognisers examine surveillance footage such as this still of Danielle 
Corns, pictured left smiling on CCTV during the riots in Wolverhampton 
city centre, and right, outside court. She was found guilty of stealing 
two left-footed trainers. So far the 'super recognisers' are only 
operating in London

Scotland Yard has now transferred Mr Hyland to their super-recogniser team, an elite squad of around 200 London officers trained to identify criminal suspects.

Psychologists are still baffled by their abilities, but officials say they have tripled the number of successful identifications they make every week and even helped prevent muggings, drug deals and assaults.

Police officers with unusually sensitive facial recognition skills have been identified within the London Met Police.

They
all hold front line positions, in units such as the Safer Neighbourhood
Teams, Robbery Squads, Intelligence Units, or in custody suites, where 
they keep up a good knowledge of local trouble makers.

When
necessary they will be required to view stills and videos from footage 
of crime scenes so they can become familiar with suspects they are 
looking for.

They
are then on the lookout for these people as they go about their usual 
front line duties, be it as part of the Neighbourhood Crime Teams or 
others.

Mick
Neville, Det Ch Insp at the Met Police's Central Forensic Image Team, 
said in an email that the 'super recognisers' identify on average about 
100 suspects a week in London.

He
said: 'They have had a very good "hit rate". For example PC Gary 
Collins from Hackney produced 180 idents from riot footage.  The current
conviction rate (in general) for riot matters is 87 per cent.'

Every
person identified by an officer as being a potential suspect is 
followed up, 'in the same manner as fingerprint and DNA evidence,' he 
said.

'In the case of 
images, a Sgt reviews the identification and research is done on the 
named person to establish if their location/offending pattern matches 
the crime in question.

'Very
few people are charged on ident evidence alone - a detective would 
arrest the subject and question him... and search for the clothing in 
the image or the stolen property etc,' he said in email.

'In
the case of a very serious crime e.g. murder, by knowing the Super 
Recognisers we can ensure that these officers see any images FIRST - 
ensuring that we limit the possibility of false identifications/wrong 
leads.'

He added: 'It is another tactic to make London safer AND make best use of our resources.'

Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville  said: ‘When we have an image of an unidentified criminal, I know exactly who to ask instead of sending it out to everyone and getting a bunch of false leads.’

He decided to set up the unit in 2011 after realising that the police could identify criminals based on their DNA and fingerprints, but had nothing to help them find suspects solely by using their images.

The team has so far been remarkably successful – even outperforming facial recognition computer programs.

They proved especially valuable during the London riots in summer 2011. After the violence subsided, Scotland Yard combed through hundreds of hours of surveillance video.

So far there have been nearly 5,000 arrests – and around 4,000 of those were based on police identifications of suspects from video images.

The super-recognisers were responsible for nearly 30 per cent of the identifications, including one officer who found around 300 people.

However a facial recognition program made only one successful identification. Scotland Yard says the team also prevented thefts and assaults at last month’s Notting Hill Carnival – and even helped catch a drug dealer.

Mr Neville admitted that the officers, like the Yard’s specially trained sniffer dogs, are not infallible. He explained that their identification is often only the start of a case which prompts police to start looking for other evidence.

But legal experts warned that it could be problematic to use super-recognisers as expert witnesses in court if they have identified criminals based on an imperfect image.

Mike Redmayne, a law professor at the London School of Economics, said: ‘Unless we subject them to rigorous testing, then we are just taking their word on trust.

‘Perhaps they can do what they say, but we don’t have the evidence yet. If it was up to me, I would not allow it in court.’

And Charles Farrier, from UK privacy group No CCTV, claimed the unit was just ‘the latest gimmick’ to promote the widespread use of surveillance cameras.

He said: ‘It is a slippery slope when we want to start to justify the widespread use of blanket surveillance just in case a policeman spots someone. The use of super-recognisers will lead to cases of mistaken identity and forms part of a surveillance culture that spreads fear and distrust.’

Clarice Ali was caught on CCTV making an obscene gesture to the camera while her 
daughter stands beside her, a blue scarf wrapped around her head. Ali and her daughter were arrested and given custodial sentences for their looting. It is not known if Ali, right, was found by a 'super recogniser'
