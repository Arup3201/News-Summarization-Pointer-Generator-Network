Plastic bank-notes will arrive in Britain within three years, ending 160 years of tradition.

The Bank of England has this morning announced that the next £5 and £10 notes will be printed on polymer.

Since 1853, bank-notes have been made from cotton paper but the Bank has carried out three years of research on switching to polymer notes.

Polymer: The current cotton paper notes will be replaced with more resilient plastic versions, such as the one shown here

Tough: The new notes can survive a wash at 90 degrees and are more difficult to counterfeit

These can be wiped clean and survive a hot washing machine cycle at 90 degrees.

The new polymer notes will retain the familiar look of Bank of England banknotes, including the portrait of Her Majesty the Queen and a historical character. 

The first polymer note will be the £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill and will be issued in 2016.

It will be followed around a year later by a polymer £10 note featuring Jane Austen.

Announcing the decision Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, said: 'Ensuring trust and confidence in money is at the heart of what central banks do.

'Polymer notes are the next step in the evolution of banknote design to meet that objective. 

'The quality of polymer notes is higher, they are more secure from counterfeiting, and they can be produced at lower cost to the taxpayer and the environment.'

Echoing the sentiment John Sheridan, who leads on counterfeit currency for the National Crime Agency, welcomed the move.

First up: The earliest plastic note to be issued will be the £5, featuring Winston Churchill, in 2016

He said while no banknote is ever completely safe from counterfeiting, polymer notes will make life harder for those those trying to fake it.

Polymer notes allow for security features including transparent windows.

Criminals trying to replicate plastic banknotes will also face challenges copying the metallic strip on the notes.

Mr Sheridan, added: 'The NCA welcomes the introduction of polymer banks notes which represent a significant improvement over cotton based technologies, with improved options for countermeasures and intervention opportunities for law enforcement.'

Announcement: Bank of England governor Mark Carney made a speech introducing the new breed of bank note

In September, the Bank said it would 
initially look only at changing the £5 and £10 notes, with the first one
 being the new £5 featuring Sir Winston Churchill in 2016. At the time, 
it promised to do nothing unless the public approved.

If the feedback was overwhelmingly 
negative, the Bank promised to scrap the idea. But the response to that consultation was overwhelmingly supportive of polymer notes. 

Over the course of two months, the Bank hosted events across the country to give the public the opportunity to learn more about polymer banknotes, to handle the notes, and to provide feedback.

Nearly 13,000 individuals gave their views during the public consultation programme, with 87per cent of those who responded, being in favour of polymer, and only six per cent were opposed with seven per cent remaining were neutral.

The decision follows a three-year research programme by the Bank looking at the materials on which banknotes are printed, and which concluded that there were compelling reasons to move to printing on polymer.

The Bank's research found the plastic notes are resistant to dirt and moisture so stay cleaner for longer than the traditional paper notes.

Current bank-notes are made from ‘cotton paper’, produced using tough, long-lasting cotton fibres rather than wood pulp.

Polymer bank-notes would be made from a transparent, flexible polypropylene film coated with layers of special ink, usually white.

This would be cut into sheets, with notes printed using standard equipment.

The notes are very difficult to tear at first, but will rip easily once they have a nick in them. More than 20 countries use polymer notes, none of them in Europe.

The Bank of New Zealand claims they last four times as long as paper notes.

They can cope with going through a washing machine, but not being ironed at high temperatures.

They start to ‘shrink and melt’ at 120C, the Bank’s report found.

The Bank of England has accepted notes in some form – originally hand-written –  since its creation in 1694.

The polymer bank-notes are secure and incorporate advanced security features making them harder to copy.

And
 the notes are more durable, lasting at least 2.5 times longer than 
paper banknotes currently in circulation. As such the notes are more 
environmentally friendly, and because they last longer, over time they 
are cheater than paper notes.

The switch is expected to save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period.

A typical £5 note currently lasts for
 just two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, 
according to its research published in the autumn.

Polymer notes are already
 used in more than 20 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, 
Mexico, Singapore and Mauritius as well as Canada.

They can also be recycled, a move 
which is likely to please the Governor of the Bank of England Mark 
Carney's wife Diana, a committed environmentalist.

The mother-of-four is well known as a green activist with a pet hate of individually-wrapped tea bags and as an advocate of pencils which last a lifetime.

The polymer notes could be recycled in different ways, from producing household energy to being used to create garden furniture and plant pots.

The new notes will be smaller than those already in circulation and while cash machines will be largely unaffected, the cassettes which hold £5 notes will have to be changed.

A spokesman for LINK, which operates the UK cash machine network, said it is not known at this stage what the cost of adapting the country's cash machines will be.

CEO John Howells welcomed the move to plastic, adding it proves 'cash still plays a vital role in our lives'.

He said LINK will work closely with the Bank of England and the cash services industry to ensure a smooth transition to polymer notes, adding they will liase with counterparts in Canada and other countries where plastic notes are already in circulation.

'We are 
always working hard to ensure the UK’s estate of ATMs is fit for the 
21st century and beyond, but this will also give our bank notes the 
chance to continue to play their part in the future,' he said.

'While
 the detailed planning is in the early stages and the full specification
 of the new notes has still has to be announced LINK understand that the
 changes required will involve at least modification of the cash 
cassettes to accommodate the new note size and in some cases at least, 
an engineer visit to each affected ATM to adjust various sensors.

New notes: The new £5 and £10 notes which will be introduced in 2016 and will feature Winston Churchill and Jane Austen respectively will be the first to be transferred to the plastic polymer

'Experience from other countries suggests that in most cases ATMs will be
 able to cope with new polymer note denominations (£5s and in time £10s)
 and older style paper denominations (£20 notess) at the same time however 
both paper and polymer of the same denomination are unlikely. 

'Therefore
 once an individual machine has been swapped to polymer for that 
denomination then it will dispense them from that point onwards.'

The Bank has said it understands the importance of notes in ‘everyone’s day-to-day lives’ and has held meetings in shopping centres and focus groups to test opinion. Consultation ended on November 15.

The new notes would still feature the Queen as well as a famous person, such as the naturalist Charles Darwin.

However, they would be slightly smaller than the cotton paper version.

The current £5 note is 135mm by 70mm. If the switch to plastic goes ahead, the new one will be 125mm by 65mm.

But they would continue ‘the existing format of tiered-sizing’, that is, the higher the denomination, the bigger the note.

For those who frequently forget to take cash out of their pockets before washing their clothes, a shift to plastic would be a big benefit.

Tests on the polymer notes in a 90-degree cycle had only ‘a minimal effect’ but paper notes  can be  ‘substantially degraded’.

The Bank also tested the polymer notes by submerging them in liquids, including red wine, and found they could be ‘wiped clean’. Normal notes stain or disintegrate.

In Canada, some users detected an aroma of maple on the plastic version, forcing the national bank to deny that any scent was added.
