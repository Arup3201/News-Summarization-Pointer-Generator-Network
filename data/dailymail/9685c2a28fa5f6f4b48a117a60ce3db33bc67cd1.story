Benefits Street star White Dee was 
kicked in the back of the head and hurled into a swimming pool by a thug
 who rounded on her at a luxury resort in Magaluf.

The reality TV queen struggled to swim as the man's friends filmed the incident, pointing and laughing

Police
 have retrieved CCTV from the Spanish hotel complex and launched an 
urgent appeal for witnesses of the alleged assault - which left Dee with
 whiplash.

Attacked: White Dee, pictured at the four-hour pool party she hosted, has been left shaken after a man (not pictured) in his 20s allegedly kicked her in the back of the head and plunged her into a pool in Magaluf

Today, Dee, 42, will meet with organisers to discuss potential compensation for her injuries.

The
 so-called 'attacker', a British promoter in his 20s working on the 
island, has been fired and will be questioned by police today.

Meanwhile Dee now intends to press charges.

Dee
 - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - was hosting a four-hour pool party
 followed by a six-hour bar crawl at the holiday resort.

It comes just a month after she sparked 
outrage after being pictured drinking champagne in a VIP area as part of
 a £10,000 promotional holiday.

Compensation: The reality TV queen (pictured en route to Magaluf with tourists uninvolved in the incident) is now meeting with organisers to discuss compensation

But while posing for pictures, she was approached by the man who ran up the full length of the pool before launching himself at her and hitting her in the head with his knee.

Both fell into the pool and the reality star was left trying to doggy-paddle.

Suffering whiplash, she was then forced to miss the six-hour bar crawl.

Her agent Barry Tomes, who witnessed the assault, told MailOnline: 'Thankfully Dee can swim.

'But as far as we are concerned this is clearly an assault and we called the police immediately.

'Dee intends to make an assault charge. 

'This man ran up behind her, kicked her in the back of the head, and she fell in the pool.

'She is now feeling very distressed and shaken up. She has a sore head and a bruised arm.

'It isn't fair, she's a real person. Dee takes a lot of flack and takes it in good stead, but this was horrible.

'There wasn't a lifeguard and she was never going to go in the pool.

'I
 just felt embarrassed by Brits abroad. The staff at the hotel and my 
American business partner were horrified by these boisterous 18- to 
25-year-olds. 

'This guy just wanted to be the big cheese and he's left Dee feeling so shaken.

'I hope she will be feeling well enough for the next few things we've got lined up back home.'

Today, Dee and Mr Tomes will meet with organisers to discuss potential compensation.

Pressing charges: The reality TV queen, 42, who made her name as a star on Benefits Street, will today discuss compensation with the organisers of the four-hour pool party after suffering whiplash

Career: The event was one of a string of promotional appearances Deirdre Kelly is making after shooting to fame earlier this year. She has since filmed her own cookery show which is due to be screened this summer

Mr Tomes said: 'We will need to have a conversation about it. With her medical condition, even something like that can make her depressed.'

Flying back to her council house in Birmingham tomorrow, Dee has already scheduled a medical examination with a GP.

She then has a string of TV appearances lined up before launching her cookery programme, which is set to make £20,000.
