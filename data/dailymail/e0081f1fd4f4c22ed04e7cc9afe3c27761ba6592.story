Dundee United have vowed to take on the SFA after midfielder Paul Paton was handed a two-match ban for spitting on Jonny Hayes – despite the Aberdeen winger insisting the incident did not happen.

In the wake of the surprise verdict, the Tannadice club offered Paton their full backing to and announced plans to appeal – only to be informed there was no right of appeal in SFA Fast Track cases.

A ‘stunned’ United however vowed not to back down and released a scathing statement attacking new SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan and the Judicial Panel for the ‘incredulous’ and ‘mystifying’ decision to find Paton guilty.

'The player will certainly be appealing this decision and will be given our full backing in this matter.

'The decision today relating to Paul Paton is incredulous. 

'It is truly mystifying that three people in a room at Hampden Park in Glasgow on a Thursday afternoon can see something that was not seen by the referee, 1st assistant, 2nd assistant, fourth official, SPFL delegate, the managers of either team, the players of either team including the alleged villain and victim not to mention the 11,168 supporters in the stadium.'

Last night the SFA confirmed to Sportsmail there is no right of appeal meaning Paton is banned for Sunday’s home match against champions Celtic and the following week’s visit to St Johnstone.

‘We are of the opinion that the wording of the current rules allows us to challenge a fundamentally flawed decision – like this undoubtedly is,’ a defiant United spokesman insisted. ‘We will contest this ban as hard as we can.’

United had believed their written submission to the SFA - containing blown-up footage of the alleged incident - in addition to Hayes’ strong denial on Twitter that any spitting occurred, would see their player exonerated.

After Paton was handed the two-game ban, however, a furious United went on the offensive.

‘The player will certainly be appealing this decision and will be given our full backing in this matter,’ a club statement said. ‘The decision relating to Paul Paton is incredulous. We are stunned firstly that it was brought in front of the Judicial Panel by the new Compliance Officer and secondly that the Judicial Panel have found the player guilty of something that we do not believe to have taken place. 

‘It is truly mystifying that three people in a room at Hampden Park in Glasgow on a Thursday afternoon can see something that was not seen by the referee, first assistant, second assistant, fourth official, SPFL delegate, the managers of either team, the players of either team including the alleged villain and victim not to mention the 11,168 supporters in the stadium.

‘As part of our original defence submission we studied enlarged video footage to ensure our player was not guilty of such an offence. We were sound in our belief that no such action had taken place and we will continue to support the player in this matter through the appeal process.’

Paton was found guilty by a Scottish FA disciplinary panel on Thursday after being accused of spitting

AfterThursday’s verdict, an angry Paton took to Twitter to vent his own bemusement at being found guilty.

He tweeted: ‘I honestly have no words?! Can’t say too much, just wow’ while Dons winger Hayes merely posted an ‘embarrassed’ face on his own Twitter page.

Speaking on Radio Scotland on Thursday night, Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes said there has been no complaint from Aberdeen regarding the incident and backed his player for the ‘honourable’ stance of taking to Twitter in an attempt to clear Paton.

The incident in question happened during the second half of Saturday’s 2-0 victory for Aberdeen at Tannadice. After catching Hayes from behind, Paton stood over his fallen opponent, who jumped up furiously to remonstrate with the United midfielder.

No action was taken at the time by referee Crawford Allan but after reviewing footage, a notice of complaint was issued by McGlennan.

That prompted Hayes to take to Twitter earlier this week to defend his opponent, saying: ‘Just wanna clear it up that Paul Paton never spat at me, what happens and is said on the pitch is brushed aside at the end of 90mins! What happened on Saturday will stay between myself and Paul, we’ve spoke on this non issue, and if asked I’ll confirm what happened.

‘To the Scottish FA, I’d never want to see a fellow pro being accused or found guilty of something that never happened!’

A spokesman for Aberdeen said Hayes remained adamant the incident had not happened but the Pittodrie club declined to comment further.
