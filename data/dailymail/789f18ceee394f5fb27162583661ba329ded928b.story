U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry recalled for young Germans Tuesday when he snuck out of the American embassy in divided postwar Berlin at age 12 for a clandestine bicycle ride into the Soviet-controlled eastern part of the city.

Kerry told the story to a group of young
 people in a packed Internet cafe in Berlin as he defended U.S. freedom 
of speech laws, saying that 'In America, you have a right to be stupid.'

'As a 12-year-old, I saw the difference between the east and the west,' said Kerry, who had lived in Berlin in 1950s with his family and American diplomat father. 'I saw people were in darker clothing and there were fewer people in the street. There were fewer cars. I didn’t feel the movement and the energy that existed elsewhere.'

Kerry recalled that when he returned home from his secretive bicycle ride through East Berlin, his father was livid.

'He got very upset with me and said, "You could have created an international incident. I could have lost my job." So I lost my passport, and I was grounded and I never made another trip like that,' Kerry said.

As he looks back on that day in 1954, Kerry said: 'I never forgot and now it's vanished. Now, so many other countries have followed with this spirit of giving life to people's individual hopes and aspirations.'

Kerry's trip to Berlin, his first as secretary of state, is part of a nine-country dash through Europe and the Middle East.

He is using the visit as an opportunity to praise religious and political tolerance in the U.S. and encourage other countries to seek the same freedoms.

'In America, you have a right to be 
stupid, if you want to be,' he said. 'And you have a right to be 
disconnected to somebody else if you want to be. And we tolerate that - 
we somehow make it through that.

Tolerance is 'something worth fighting for,' he explained.

'We live and breathe the idea of religious
 freedom and religious tolerance, whatever the religion - and political 
freedom and political tolerance, whatever the point of view,' he said.

In an aside, Kerry also took the opportunity to heap praise on the preppy New England clothing line Vineyard Vines, which is popular on Capitol Hill and in upscale communities across the Northeast, after someone complimented him on his pink tie. 

After praising the company, he told the crowd where they could buy the tie online and said to laughter, 'I don't own any stock in the company.'

Kerry has formerly addressed his Berlin outing in an address to State Department employees earlier this month.

'If the tabloids today knew I had done that, I can see the headlines that say, "Kerry's Early Communist Connections!'" he joked.

On a more serious note, he explained,
 'There were very few people. They were dressed in dark clothing. They 
kind of held their heads down. I noticed all this.

'There was no joy in those streets. 
And when I came back, I felt this remarkable sense of relief and a great
 lesson about the virtue of freedom and the virtue of the principles and
 ideals that we live by and that drive us.'
