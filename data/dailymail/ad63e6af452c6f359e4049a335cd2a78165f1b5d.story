When Louis van Gaal led Holland to a World Cup semi-final playing three at the back and declared he would use the same system at Manchester United it appeared we could be on the cusp of a tactical revolution in this country.

Shortly after though Van Gaal, like Harry Redknapp at QPR and a few other managers at clubs in the Football League, had quickly abandoned the back three and returned to systems traditionally more tried and trusted on these shores.

One place the back three is still going strong though is not in the aforementioned footballing heartlands of Manchester and London, but down in Bristol. At Ashton Gate, to be precise.

Louis van Gaal used three at the back with plenty of success at the World Cup with Holland

The opening day of the season saw Sheffield United welcome Bristol City to Bramall Lane. It was supposed to be the confirmation of pre-season predictions that Nigel Clough's Blades would canter to the League One title, but Steve Cotterill hadn't read the script.

Cotterill surprised his opposite number with a 3-4-3 system, silencing the home crowd early on by flooding players forward and eventually running out 2-1 winners.

Bristol City have not looked back since.

Three months on, still employing a system similar to those abandoned by Van Gaal and Redknapp, and Cotterill's side remain unbeaten in League One.

Saturday's 1-0 win over Oldham at Ashton Gate was their 10th victory in League One season. If he is being picky, six draws is probably more than Cotterill will have liked, but his side do not lack adventure - they are the top scorers in the division with 33 goals already.

That's quite some feat when you consider they lost League One's top scorer last season, Sam Baldock, to Brighton in August.

The 23 goals lost with Baldock's departure look like they will be more than compensated for by the attacking trio of Kieran Agard, Aaron Wilbraham and Luke Freeman - all signed in the summer.

In Cotterill's system, Wilbraham is the target man with the pace of Agard and the guile of Freeman providing further goal threats coming from wide and deep. Between the three of them they have scored 17 in the league already this season.

Bristol City have been lucky with injuries so far. Cotterill has had to make very few changes to his starting line-up and with a small squad to choose from he'll need that luck to remain if they are to keep up this relentless form.

Cotterill's side are still unbeaten in League One three months and 16 games in to the season

Excluding Baldock, Cotterill has only used 17 players in the league but he does have some nous in reserve to call upon. Defender Adam El-Abd, winger Scott Wagstaff and forward Jay Emmanuel-Thomas have not been regular starters but all have Championship experience.

The key will be if those players can slot quickly in to Cotterill's system and one suspects, given how well prepared Bristol City were on that opening day to play three at the back, they might just do so.

It is refreshing to see genuine innovation in the lower leagues, and with it a real gamble paying off.

The tactical success of Holland and Costa Rica at the World Cup may not have had the impact expected by some on the top flight, but it's influencing things in the third tier.

Good week for... HUDDERSFIELD. After failing to win any of his first three games at the club, Chris Powell has masterminded a seven-match unbeaten run. Saturday's 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest leaves the Terriers just six points off the Championship play-off places and, more importantly, eight points clear of the relegation zone.

Bad week for... PRESTON. Having won eight on the spin in League One, Simon Grayson's side headed into Saturday's trip to Rochdale full of confidence. It came as a huge surprise to all, then, when they were seen off rather easily in a 3-0 defeat to dent their automatic promotion hopes.

Talent scout: Miles Storey (Portsmouth)

A recent Football League column highlighted the number of young talents coming through at Swindon and Storey is another one, albeit it he is out on loan at Portsmouth. 

The 20-year-old striker, given his debut by Paolo Di Canio in the 2011-12 season, netted in a 3-0 win over Carlisle on Saturday. He is still highly thought of at the County Ground despite being sent out on loan.
