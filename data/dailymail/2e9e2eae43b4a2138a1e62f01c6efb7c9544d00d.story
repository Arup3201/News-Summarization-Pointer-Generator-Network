Emma Sayle, founder of the Killing Kittens sex parties, who are hosting their first event in New York City

She is best known as the society beauty who attended the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge and now organises sex parties for young actors and models.

And now Emma Sayle, founder of the Killing Kittens parties is taking her events to New York City, it has been reported.

Miss Sayle has been hosting the parties for the ‘sexual elite’ at secret, upmarket locations, which include discreet boutique hotels in Surrey, country estates in Berkshire and West Sussex, and luxury penthouses in London and LA.

Those who hope to gain access must be aged between 18 and 45 and must either be a single girl or part of a couple.

Applications are made via the Killing Kittens website and must be accompanied by a photograph.

Now the New York Post has reported that the first Killing Kittens party will take place in a rented loft in Manhattan near to the Flatiron building on Saturday.

It is thought around 60 people have already signed up to attend the party, including bankers and models.  

She told the newspaper: 'Statistically, New York is in our favour for it to work.

'It might help with all the frustration of all those women who can’t find men. They can come and share the men!'

An event in Los Angeles is also set to take place at the weekend.  

Ms Sayle went to Downe House, the all-girls public school in Berkshire where Kate Middleton was also briefly a pupil. 

The entrepreneur then attended the University of Birmingham, where she first started organising parties and charities events.

After graduating, she did a stint in the City before gravitating towards PR. It was then that she became acquainted with the sex-party industry.

She also joined the Duchess in a dragon boat team called the Sisterhood for a charity race in 2007.

Her first Killing Kittens event took place in Covent Garden, Central London, in 2005.

Since then she has expanded the business across the UK, and has staged parties in the United States, with plans to host events in Australia and New Zealand.

Speaking last year and referring to her UK Killing Kittens parties, which are aimed at those aged between 18 and 45, Ms Sayle said: ‘We've have had a few MPs and famous singers.

'We haven’t had any Royals yet but there have been a few A-list actors and actresses – but I couldn't reveal who.’

Last year, she also revealed how she had expanded her parties to cater for older people over the age of 45.

Like their younger counterparts attending Ms Sayles’s Killing Kittens parties, would-be Silver Kittens must submit a recent photograph of themselves with their application forms. Only the good-looking are invited and they must be aged 45 or over. 

About 80 guests aged up to 60, wearing black tie or cocktail dresses, ate oysters and chocolates and sipped champagne before ‘retiring’ to candle-lit boudoirs. 

At the time she told the Mail on Sunday: 'Our first event went really well. The oldest person there was a guy aged 60, but he was in good shape. He had an air of confidence – sexiness comes down to confidence.

‘You can get a lot of stunning catwalk models in their 20s who are not confident. There’s nothing sexy about them. Older people just don’t care.'
