We're used to seeing them resplendent in uber-girly ball gowns, looking angelic and - well - princessy. 

But drawings of the Disney princesses by Italian artist Emmanuel Viola show us our childhood favourites in a new light; a hipster one.

Complete with neck tatts, facial piercings and dip-dyed hair, Belle, Ariel, Cinderella, Jasmine, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White have all undergone a very 21st century makeover in this series of pictures.

Once upon a dream: Angelic Aurora is re-imagined as an angsty tattoo artist, complete with Maleficent tattoo

As always they have their loyal friends - animal, dwarf and household furniture - close by. In fact they're closer than ever, with each princess having tattoos of her fellow Disney characters.

The beautiful Belle has been transformed into an ombre-haired Goth, while the usually angelic Aurora looks somewhat menacing as a Disney Princess tattoo artist.

Cinderella and Snow White are  channeling glam rock and 50s pin-up girl chic, with upswept hair,  corsets and plenty of attitude.

Pin up: Snow White is still stealing Dopey's heart with this sassy look, reminiscent of the iconic 'We Can Do It' poster

While Cinders has tattoos of her mouse friends, Snow has her loyal companion Dopey on her arm, as well as the iconic poison apple.

Ariel seems to have got her festival gear on, sporting teeny-tiny shorts, as well as a Monroe piercing and plenty of black eyeliner.

And Jasmine is looking bang on trend with blue dip-dyed hair - although we're not sure that her father the Sultan would be happy with her multiple facial piercings or neck tattoo of her tiger buddy Rajah.
