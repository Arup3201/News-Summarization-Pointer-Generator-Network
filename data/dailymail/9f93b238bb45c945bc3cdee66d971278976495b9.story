At £42.5m Mesut Ozil is the most expensive export in the history of German football. After his performance in Munich you wouldn’t pay two-bob for him.

There should be something special about returning to the country where it all started for the Arsenal midfielder.

Behind those eyes something is going on with Ozil because he is simply not right.

Waste: Mesut Ozil, all £42.5m worth of him, struggled in Munich before being hauled off at half-time

Despair: The Germany midfielder barely got into the game against Bayern Munich

No impact: The German had just 21 touches in the the opening 45 minutes - Thiago Alcantara (right) had 66

Embarrassing: Ozil's heat map from our Match Zone shows he was barely involved on Tuesday night

The Germany midfielder suffered a hamstring injury in the Allianz Arena and looks sure to miss a series of crucial Barclays Premier League matches, starting with Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham.

He was treated by Bayern and Germany doctor Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt at the break and will have a scan on Wednesday.

Ozil was replaced by Tomas Rosicky at half-time and Wenger said: ‘He’s out for a few weeks. It is a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious. I don’t know how long and we hope it’s not so bad.’ In the half that he was on the pitch, Ozil had just 21 touches of the ball.

To put that into some kind of perspective Thiago Alcantara, operating in the heartbeat of Bayern’s midfield, had 66.

Want more? Bastian Schweinsteiger: 47. Arjen Robben 33. Franck Ribery 33.

Ozil, the highest-paid player in the history of Arsenal, is nicking a living.

In the Allianz Arena, against the world’s best club side, he had a face on him like a slapped backside until he was substituted at the break. He was lucky to get to half-time.

We have been here before with him, notably at Manchester City, when Arsenal lost 6-3, and again in the 5-1 defeat at Liverpool.

Change: Arsene Wenger waited until half-time to take Ozil off, but he could have done it sooner

Out of sync: Ozil looked lost, lazy and disinterested in the Allianz

All smiles: Ozil seemed happy in the pre-match warm-up, but that didn't last long

So what if he scored the first of four goals in an FA Cup quarter-final at home to Everton at the weekend? That’s a sticking plaster.

There is a wider issue here and it is down to Wenger to find out what is going wrong with one of the most talented players in the game.

The exuberance has gone, deserting him at a time when his team-mates are looking to the former Real Madrid midfielder for inspiration.

His time at the Bernabeu has gone and he can look wistfully at the team who beat Schalke 6-1 at the same stage of this competition all he likes.

Bright spark: In contrast to Ozil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was brilliant for Arsenal

Opener: Ozil scored the first of Arsenal's four goals against Everton, but that's not enough

Good times: Ozil enjoyed a great relationship at Real Madrid with Crisitano Ronaldo - even though he was accused of drifting in and out of games

The days when he drifted in and out of games with Real are behind him. Now he just looks like a lost soul, lazy and disinterested.

A week ago, in the Stuttgart Stadion, Germany’s fans were on his back during their victory over Chile in a friendly.

He had set up the only goal for Mario Gotze, who started this game for Bayern Munich, but it still wasn’t enough to appease them.

Three weeks ago in London, it was all 
too much for him after he had missed the chance to put Arsenal ahead 
from the penalty spot.

On his back: Ozil set up a goal in Germany's game against Chile, but was still subject to jeers from German fans

Advanced: Pep Guardiola saw his Bayern team comfortably take care of Arsenal

It 
was there that his great friend Manuel Neuer saved his spot-kick and 
after Ozil’s game simply fell apart. He is better than that.

This
 was another limp contribution, a player simply going through the 
motions as Arsenal inevitably went out of the Champions League in the 
second round.

Stationed
 on the right, where he often plays for the national team, his first and
 only meaningful contribution was a corner in the 31st minute that was 
met by the head of Olivier Giroud. Neuer did well to save.

After this, it is down to Wenger to rescue him.

Limp: Ozil went through the motions with Arsenal exiting the Champions League

Haunted: Is Ozil's penalty miss in the first leg still praying on his mind?

Plaudits: Bayern Munich march into the Champions League quarter-final
