A woman has been arrested for drunk driving through a town in the wrong lane - while dressed as Hello Kitty.

Carrie Gipson, 37, was dressed as the Japanese cartoon character at 2am Sunday morning when police in Gorham, Maine, pulled her over.

Gipson, wearing a frilly pink and white outfit with a white, cat-shaped face mask with a bow on top, was arrested when she refused to take an OUI test.

She was taken to the Cumberland County Jail in nearby Portland, the Smoking Gun reported.

A law enforcement source told MailOnline: 'She had a bad night'.

Officers used the opportunity to remind drivers in the area that they will be especially vigilant for costumed drivers with Hallowe'en approaching.
