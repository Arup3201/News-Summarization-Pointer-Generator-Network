Women's legs have got Lululemon in trouble again after a Maryland store posted a poem in its window rhyming 'apple pies' with 'rubbing thighs.'

The controversial display in the yoga-wear brand's Bethesda store comes just weeks after the company's founder suggested his customers' ample thighs were responsible for their pants being see-through.

The poem, which reads: 'Cups of Chai/Apple Pies/Rubbing thighs?' was spotted by an outraged onlooker at a store in Bethesda, who then tweeted it, prompting Lululemon to apologize and take it down.

'We're deeply sorry, the display is being taken down. We celebrate that thighs rub together - ours do too,' the company wrote online.

Thighs: Just weeks after Lululemon's founder complained women's fat legs were responsible for their pants being see-through, a Bethesda, Maryland, store, pictured, has posted a poem about 'rubbing thighs' in its window

The dispay was removed Monday night, according to the New York Daily News. The store is believed to be the same place an assistant bludgeoned, choked and stabbed-to-death a co-worker in March 2011 because she was trying to steal some yoga pants.

Lululemon founder Chip Wilson was forced to apologize in mid November for suggesting that women's heavy thighs were to blame for a line of yoga pants being recalled earlier this year because they were too sheer.

In a video posted on the company YouTube, Wilson says: 'I'm sad for the people at Lululemon... that have really had to face the brunt of my actions. I take responsibility for all that has occurred and the impact it has had on you. I'm sorry to have put you all through this.'

A week earlier he sparked outrage for saying in a Bloomberg interview about Lululemon's faulty yoga pants: 'Frankly, some women's bodies just don't actually work.'

Regret: 'I'm sad for the people at Lululemon.... that have really had to face the brunt of my actions. I take responsibility for all that has occurred and the impact it has had on you. I'm sorry to have put you all through this'

Wilson, along with his co-founder and wife Shannon Wilson, made the remarks as their company released its Full-On Luon pants, a style which claims to have 'major support and coverage'.

When speaking about how some 
customers complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Wilson  
continued: 'It's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much 
pressure is there over a period of time and how much they use it.'

In his apology video, Wilson looks earnestly at the camera, seemingly emotional as he expresses his regret. 'I'm sad. I'm really sad. I'm sad for the repercussions of my actions,' he says.

He then takes a deep breath as he appeals to loyal customers to have faith in the company.

'For all of you that have made Lululemon what it is today, I ask you to stay in a conversation that is above the fray,' he says.

'I ask you to prove that the culture that you have built cannot be chipped away. Thank you.'

Comeback: Lululemon has released an ad for Full-On Luon pants, a new style which claims to have 'major support and coverage' - unlike the pants that were pulled from shelves in March for being too sheer

Comment that caused a backlash: Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, pictured with his wife Shannon, said that some women's bodies 'don't work' for Lululemon yoga pants

The founder's controversial remarks 
caused Bloomberg TV host Trish Regan to cut in and ask: 'Interesting, 
not every woman can wear a Lululemon yoga pant?'

Wilson responded: 'No, I think they can. I just think it's how you use it.'

The
apology video has been viewed more than 98,000 times, eliciting a 
variety of reactions from viewers, with some saying it is seems somewhat
insincere.

One commenter wrote: '"I'm sad" and "I'm sorry" are different things.'

Another
said: 'Wow, that was one of the most unapologetic apologies I've heard 
in a while.  You're not sorry for what you said, but only sorry that it 
caused some issue'.

WATCH: A message from Chip Wilson, Lululemon founder

In March, the Canadian company was forced to recall 17 per cent of its yoga pants due to an 
unacceptable 'level of sheerness' created during the manufacturing 
process.

At the time, the 
company said that it was not sure why the pants were so sheer since they
hadn't changed the materials used or switched manufacturers.

The
scandal damaged its reputation and reportedly cost the company over 
$20 million, and in June CEO Christine Day announced that she would be 
stepping down after five-and-a-half years.

In a very stylized video for new yoga 
pants, lead yoga designer Antonia delicately touches on the subject, 
saying: 'We saw that there was an opportunity to take the fabric and 
evolve it to another place.'

Fine details: The leggings, which range in price from $72 to $98 per pair, 'involved a lot of people to develop,' says lead yoga designer Antonia as the camera pans to a close-up of yarn and machinery

Revamped: Full-On Luon leggings (left, $83 and 
right, $98) were launched in response to this year's too-sheer leggings 
scandal, which reportedly cost the company over $20million

Full-On Luon leggings, which range in price from $72 to $98 per pair, 'involved a lot of people to develop,' she says, adding: 'It 
took over two-and-a-half years.'

The camera shows a close-up of yarn and machinery as dramatic music plays in the background.

'In developing it we had to look at 
everything from where the yarn was coming from, how it was being 
knitted, the construction, the mills that we work with,' she explains.

Shots of women practicing various yoga poses in the pants show that they do indeed seem to maintain their opacity.

Joan, VP of global product quality, explains in the ad: 'In the testing of the product 
there's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on. Every single lot of the 
fabric is tested before it leaves the mill.'

And materials innovation director Yogendra elaborates about the seemingly painstaking process of constructing the fabric, saying: 'We use special very fine microfiber yarns with a very special yarn construction'

Still dissatisfied: One customer wrote: 'They pill and the thread in the seams loosens. I want to love these pants so bad. . . but honestly, my $15 Walmart pants are WAY better quality'

Later he adds: 'We made this fabric 55 different ways to
come to our current formulation that would give us one of the best 
fabrics in the industry.'

While the video claims that these new 
pants are made from a more supportive and opaque fabric, many of the reviews on the 
Lululemon website would suggest otherwise.

One dissatisfied customer wrote: 'They pill and the thread in the seams loosens. I want to love these pants so bad. . . but honestly, my $15 Walmart pants are WAY 
better quality.'

Another complained that the pants are just as see-through as their predecessors. 'After wearing four times I'm already experiencing pilling and sheerness,' she wrote.

'I am upset because spending so much money on leggings I expected them to be much better quality.'

A spokesperson told Reuters that only a very small number of customers has complained and that 'guest feedback is not indicative of a larger issue'.
