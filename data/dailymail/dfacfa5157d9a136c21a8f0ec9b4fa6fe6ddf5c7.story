Shana Mooyman turned her back on a glamorous life as a model and swapped it for a job in the iron ore mines of Western Australia, which has earned her enough money to buy her three investment properties.

The 25-year-old started modelling from a young age and often saw her face plastered on promotional nightclub and festival posters.

Ms Mooyman, from Bunbury in Western Australia, made the unusual career switch at the age of 19 when she became a mobile plant operator at a mineral sands mine in Cataby.

After six years behind the wheel of heavy machinery, Ms Mooyman, who is now a fully qualified operator, is adamant she can hold her own - despite working in such a predominately male industry. 

'I was a little nervous first coming into this work, being so isolated from everyone into such a small area grouped together with mainly blokes around,' she said.

'But I survived my first couple of shifts and an older lady took me under her wing.

'We started having after work drinks with my crew and that's when the potty mouth started.

'They converted me. I was now just one of the guys holding my ground not taking any of their nonsense.

'You just need to learn to speak up and don't take their jibes seriously and you'll be fine.'

At 19, she decided to leave the modelling industry (right) behind and head to the mines at Cataby in Western Australia (left)

Ms Mooyman said she wanted to move into the mining industry as it was 'something so new and exciting' with 'heaps to be learnt'.

'Once I started I was earning more than I ever did locally and loved being outdoors all day. I couldn't imagine doing anything else,' she said.

'It's definitely not for all men and women as there are so many downsides to being away.'

Ms Mooyman said she left the modelling industry because she needed a more stable profession.

'I started modelling at a young age but it was never serious enough for me to take it up further,' she said.

'When I was 18 years old I did a lot of promotional modelling night clubs, festivals and concerts in the Perth area.

'This involved photo shoots for particular venues to use for advertising purposes so I was plastered on posters for events also wearing certain outfits.

'But I was paying off loans and needed a change of job so a friend helped me out.'

Now Shana has three investment properties and is hoping her successful stint at the mine will help her set-up a life with her partner. 

She said she was grateful for the opportunities given to her, but she realised it was not for everyone.

'In no time I'd developed skills to operate a large variety of machines such as excavators, loaders, dump trucks, water carts, tractors and forklifts - you name it, I've driven it,' she said.

'I've been contracted to work on a variety of sites including Gin Gin, Eneabba and local areas around Perth.

'These would be a few weeks at a time working solo to get a job complete so I was stuck at the mines for long periods at a time.

'It can be very isolating. Being stuck in a tiny bedroom isn't for everyone.

'But it's been a great step for me and something that I never knew I'd end up doing.'
