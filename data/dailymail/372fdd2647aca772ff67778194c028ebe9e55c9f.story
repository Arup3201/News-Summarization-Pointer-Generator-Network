A former teacher, Ronny Deila will have no need of a ghost writer to pen his memoirs.

The Celtic chapters will make for essential reading. The Norwegian can already visualise how they will end; silver laden and filled with tales of triumph.

The middle section will develop the plot.

The introduction? Legia Warsaw, Inverness and Maribor will make that read like a crime noir novel.

By his own admission, Deila has struggled to plough through the opening pages of life at Celtic. Yet the Norwegian subscribes to the view that for the new and unfamiliar to become normal, a man must be overwhelmed for a bit on the way.

Ronny Deila has had a difficult start to life at Celtic, with the Hoops lagging in an alien 5th place

One of Deila's first signings was Manchester City's John Guidetti on a season-long loan deal

‘I think now it is chapter two,’ said Deila ahead of today’s Premiership clash with Aberdeen at Celtic Park.

‘But I am very glad that I had chapter one here, because it can’t be more intense than those 10 weeks were, travelling all over Europe, a lot of new things.

‘Without those 10 weeks, I wouldn’t be here with the knowledge I have now. So that has been positive. It becomes my chapter now.’

Already there are Celtic supporters who find Deila’s team sheets unreadable and incomprehensible.

The suspicion he doesn’t yet know his best team has been both difficult to shift and damaging. Yet he probably still doesn’t — and won’t for some weeks.

Aleksander Tonev and Wakaso Mubarak have yet to play a first-team game while the inclusion of John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Scott Brown offers no guarantees of immediate and sweeping improvement.

The problem for Deila is that he talks a good game even when his team can’t match his fine words. In the early weeks, the 38-year-old’s idealism about systems and philosophies obscured a basic truth; Celtic’s squad wasn’t good enough. A fact which compounded an already huge cultural shift for the new manager.

‘It’s a situation that I don’t think anybody can put themselves into,’ he said of managing Celtic. ‘To take a big team is one thing. I had never been to Scotland before – well, one time - but coming into a new culture and a new team and new experiences, and then you have also the Champions League coming very quickly.

‘And also the (transfer) window takes a lot of energy. So there were so many tasks and you have to know your staff, you have to put your ideas in — there’s an unbelievable lot to do.’

There have been times, bluntly, when people have wondered if the former coach of Stromsgodset might not be up to it.

Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell insisted he is — describing the situation Deila inherited, with Champions League qualifiers and a weaker squad, as a ‘s***storm’.

‘I can understand what Peter is saying,’ added the Norwegian. ‘But it has been fantastic, as well.

‘The opportunity is fantastic and I think there is so much potential here. When I look at the players, I see a lot of skills and a lot of opportunities.’

Deila is a relatively inexperienced manager, and some Celtic fans have not taken to him

The international break offered the first real pause for reflection, an opportunity to return home, visit his daughters and think some clear thoughts.

‘There was a lot of reflection,’ he conceded. ‘When it’s games all the time, it’s very hard to see the whole picture, so to get home it was very good to just reflect on things and see where we are and what the next moves are.

‘I can see positive things happening and, of course, things that we need to do better. That is how the process is going on. I’m looking forward now to getting started.’

Deila maintains that the fitness and speed of movement has to improve and that it will. Tonev is not yet 100 per cent while Mubarak only returned from international duty last night, rendering both of the new signings frustratingly out of reach for now.

But the Norwegian still claims he can see what he wants and how he wants to get there. Enacting change while getting results is a tricky business; a difficult balancing act. But he knows now what he is dealing with after a bewildering, overwhelming start to life at Celtic.

‘Of course there has been a lot of pressure,’ Deila continued. ‘I think the pressure after results is different to what I’m used to.

‘But also we have much better players here. The Champions League is a very high level so the fitness we had, and the squad we had, was not good enough. We need new ideas.

‘I wanted to be in the Champions League, that’s for sure. The best thing is that the window is closed and I have finished with those questions.

‘We know what we have to work with and how we are going to develop the best possible team with the players we have.

‘You have to get results and also get your own style and develop things. You don’t want to do that too early because it can affect the immediate results. Now we know what kind of squad we have until Christmas and that is positive.’

Aberdeen will travel to Glasgow fancying their chances. A dismal run of 18 straight Parkhead defeats in the league stretches back to 2004, but fails to reflect a bold, gutsy, Scottish Cup win in Glasgow’s east end last season.

Often more effective in attack away from home, Aberdeen will ask questions of Deila’s reshaped team. Few expect them to show much sign of fear and neither should they.

‘You would have to ask them that,’ added Deila. ‘But I know how good we are when we are playing well. We’ve had good spells in every match.

‘We didn’t play well against Dundee but we had 70-per-cent possession and made 700 passes. We just have to create more.

‘It would be worse if we didn’t have the ball, so it’s about what we do with our attacking play. It’s also about our defending, especially in transition.

‘That’s what I love to do, to work with a team which has the ball a lot. I want us to look more like we did against Dundee United. We showed ourselves in a good way that day.

‘In time, we will hopefully see that every week.’
