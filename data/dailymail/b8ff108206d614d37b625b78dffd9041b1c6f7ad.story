An Englishman’s home has always been his castle. Now his castle can be his holiday home as well.

A
12th century castle that fell into ruin after it was gutted by fire 
nearly 35 years ago has just won one of architecture’s most prestigious 
prizes following a ‘stunning’ restoration.

It is also available to rent as a unique holiday hideaway for eight people from £675 for four nights.

Regal: Astley Castle in Warwickshire has won the RIBA Stirling Prize 2013 for the best new building of the year

Astley Castle in Warwickshire - wrecked by a fire in 1978 - had been in danger of collapse until it was brought back to life by the £1.35 million building project for the Landmark Trust

Disrepair: Astley Castle before the building project brought the site back to life

Astley
Castle in Warwickshire was transformed from a wreck by mixing 
‘groundbreaking’ modern accommodation with the remaining medieval 
stonework.

A £1.35million 
building project for the Landmark Trust charity – described as a labour 
of love for the British architects – created a contemporary home 
entwined with 800 years of history.

It
has its own moat, an outside dining hall within a ruined, roofless 
room, plus a huge fireplace for those chilly autumn nights.

To add to the medieval atmosphere, the building is even said to come with its own headless ghost.

Ancient and modern: An architecture expert said: 'The architects have designed an incredibly powerful contemporary house which is expertly and intricately intertwined with 800 years of history'

The site has been in continuous occupation since Saxon times and has links to three English queens.

In
the early 12th century it was owned by the Astley family but the first 
Yorkist queen, Elizabeth Woodville, is said to have lived there in the 
mid 15th century before marrying Edward IV.

She bore him the ill-fated Princes in the Tower, and their daughter later married Henry VII.

Stephen Hodder, president of the Royal Institute
of British Architects, said: 'Astley Castle is an exceptional example 
of how modern architecture can revive an ancient monument

It is the first time the Landmark Trust has appointed architects to build new living accommodation within the ruined walls of an ancient building

Many of the period features are retained in the bold yet sympathetic design

It
has long-standing links with the Grey family, including Lady Jane Grey,
who was proclaimed queen in 1553 but executed with her father Henry 
Grey a year later.

Rebellious Lord Grey was captured in a hollow oak tree there.

Yesterday
it was chosen from six shortlisted buildings to become the first 
conservation project to win the annual Royal Institute of British 
Architects Stirling Prize, its highest accolade.

President
Stephen Hodder praised architects Witherford Watson Mann and described 
the work as ‘an exceptional example of how modern architecture can 
revive an ancient monument’.

Dilapidated: The Grade II listed building was 
last used as a hotel before it was destroyed by the fire in 1978. A 
number of schemes to restore the site were proposed during the 1990s but
they failed to materialise

Work needed: In 2006 a dozen architectural practices were asked to submit designs to provide accommodation within the existing site

Development: Plans drawn up by the architects show how the castle had been developed over the centuries

Historical: The site was renovated on behalf on the charity the Landmark Trust which rescues buildings of historic or architectural importance
