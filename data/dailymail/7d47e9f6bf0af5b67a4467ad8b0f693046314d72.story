A Boston-area mother found dead last month withdrew a restraining order against her abusive husband only days before she was killed, it has been revealed.

Florence Beaulieu, 37, was found dead May 16 in her Brockton apartment by one of her four children, according to reports, and husband Jean-Michel Beaulieu, 42, was arrested Sunday at the Vermont border while trying to flee to Canada.

Authorities have not publicly named him as a suspect, but a series of restraining orders and a divorce filing last month hint at the couple’s troubled past. Family members have told local media he often beat and put voodoo curses on her.

‘Anytime Florence tried to communicate with us, he beat her up,’ grieving mother Sylia Saint Louis, 57, told the Brockton Enterprise. ‘He tried to kill Florence all the time, with voodoo.’

Saint Louis told the Boston Globe that Jean-Michel Beaulieu beat her and ‘treated her like an animal.’

He faces three counts of violating a restraining order, the second taken out against him by Florence Beaulieu, but she declined to extend the latest order of protection when it expired May 14, relatives told the Globe.

She was found dead by her children only two days later, bringing a violent end to their 15-year marriage. An official cause of death has not been announced.

‘On many occasions I had to call the police as a result of physical abuse ,’ the battered woman wrote in an application for the second restraining order taken out against Jean-Michel Beaulieu.

‘Every time he would beat me up, he bit, slapped and had spit on my face, as a result he has been arrested’ the battered woman wrote in an application for the second restraining order taken out against Jean-Michel Beaulieu.

‘On many occasions I had to call the police as a result of physical abuse. I have had to go to the hospital after he beat me,’ she continued.

‘I and the children are fearful for our lives and feel very threatened by him.’

She then decided against extending that restraining order after a minister advised her not to, Saint Louis recalled. The preacher said to reunite the family.

Her parents pleaded with her to reconsider, but she insisted everything would be okay.

‘The cultural problem we have in our community is that people who aren’t trained to give advice in these situations are often the people who are turned to,’ the dead woman’s father, Emmanuel Saint Louis, told the Globe.

‘Here you have a young woman who was crying for help, but there were cultural barriers and knowledge barriers.’

The pair was granted custody of their four grandchildren last week, and Jean-Michel was arrested not long after.

Authorities apprehended him at the Vermont border trying to cross into Quebec.

‘He was coming through the port of entry and was stopped,’ U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson Stephen Sapp told WCVB. ‘We discovered that he was wanted for homicide in the city of Brockton.’

He has not yet been officially charged in the murder, but officials said he will be arraigned ‘at a later date.’

Florence Beaulieu’s parents told the Globe they are convinced her estranged husband is involved in her being killed.

‘I’m glad she is not suffering anymore,’ Emmanuel Saint Louis said. ‘He is going to pay the price for everything he did.’

Jean-Michel Beaulieu remains in custody awaiting his arraignment.
