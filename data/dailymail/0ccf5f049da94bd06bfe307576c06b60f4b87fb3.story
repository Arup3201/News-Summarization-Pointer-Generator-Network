Eric Frein obsessively collected military memorabilia, dismissed his fellow war re-enactors as dilettantes, and took his hobby so seriously that he spoke French during a simulated Vietnam War-era interrogation, according to a filmmaker who interviewed the man now suspected of ambushing a Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

Frein appears in an upcoming documentary about Vietnam re-enactors called 'Vietnam Appreciation Day,' identifying himself by name and saying that re-enactments are 'about teaching the public and showing the equipment that was used, talking about the history of it all.'

Frein, 31, is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring another trooper in the Sept. 12 ambush outside a rural barracks. He has managed to elude hundreds of law enforcement officials looking for him in the heavily wooded Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania.

Killer? Frein, 31, is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring another trooper in the Sept. 12 ambush outside a rural Pennsylvania State Police barracks 

Determined: Frein made sure every detail of his look was just right, Bresnan said, and lost himself in the simulated battles that featured authentic period military rifles firing blanks

Police have yet to find Frein, who has so far eluded authorities for 10 days 

The documentary's director, Patrick Bresnan, recalled Frein as odd and aloof, segregating himself from the other re-enactors.

Frein and two of his friends 'kind of viewed the other re-enactors as, in their words, playing cowboys and Indians,' Bresnan told The Associated Press on Tuesday. '"They are playing war," is what he says, "and we're here because we want to preserve the history of war and we want to meet veterans and we want to catalogue their stories."'

Frein made sure every detail of his look was just right, Bresnan said, and lost himself in the simulated battles that featured authentic period military rifles firing blanks.

'If you saw Eric go through the woods, it was very scary,' he told The Associated Press. 'He was absolutely serious when he was going through the brush, hunting Viet Cong at these re-enactments.'

The director added he did not feel Frein posed an actual threat.

'With Eric and his friends, they are so much more educated than the average re-enactor that we figured they were too smart to harm anyone,' he said.

Police have called Frein a survivalist with a vendetta against law enforcement. They believe he's hiding in the woods where he grew up and his parents still live. But there was no indication Tuesday that authorities are imminently close to catching him.

Frein attended East Stroudsburg University for one semester as a history student in 2005 and then again for two semesters in 2011 and 2012 as a chemistry major, but he didn't graduate, said Brenda Friday, a university spokeswoman. He also attended classes off and on at Northampton Community College from 2008 to 2013 but never received a degree, said spokeswoman Heidi Butler.

Frein once worked as a part-time, seasonal employee at the Boy Scouts of America's Camp Minsi in the Poconos, according to Craig Poland, scout executive with the Minsi Trails Council.

As the search for Frein continued, NBC's 'Today' show aired footage from 'Vietnam Appreciation Day.'

An undated photo provided by the Pennsylvania State Police shows what they say are magazines for an AK-47-style assault rifle that they have recovered from the woods in the manhunt for Eric Frein

In one clip, Frein talked about the difficult terrain where one of the re-enactments took place — an eerie prelude to the real-life manhunt playing out in the area around Canadensis, where authorities have been closing roads and residents have been unable to get back to their homes due to the heavy police presence.

'We had to find them, and we just walked around for two days straight,' he said in the clip. 

Though Bresnan last saw Frein in 2011, the director remembered Frein and his friends clearly.

'They really identified with the soldiers of Vietnam because they came back to the U.S. and were rejects from society,' Bresnan said. 'Eric and his friends definitely identified with the underdogs and rejects.' 

Fellow director Ivete Lucas, who appeared in an NBC News interview with Bresnan, told the news station 'Eric actually thought that the way that the other re-enactors reenacted in front of the veterans was inaccurate. 

'So he thought they were - they seemed like they were playing war games instead of being very accurate and precise and showing exactly how it was in Vietnam, so he preferred to do the tactical battles in the woods because they - that way they could really get into that mindset and not offend or you now, stir emotions in veterans.'

The directors' comments come after State. Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters 'I do believe we are close to him at this point,' ABC News reported.

'We're following up on tips, we believe they're very credible,' Bivens also said. 'And yes, there is a lot of police activity. It's been ongoing throughout the night.'

On Sunday, Bivens said 'Based on our investigations, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,' according to CNN.

He also said 'I am convinced that Frein has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, specifically the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight.'
