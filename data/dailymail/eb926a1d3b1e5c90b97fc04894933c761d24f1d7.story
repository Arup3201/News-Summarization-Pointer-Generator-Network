Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has said qualifying for the Champions League again would be a bigger achievement than running Manchester City close to the Premier League title last season.

And the Anfield boss, whose side face City at Anfield on Sunday two places outside the top four, claims the pressure is on Manchester United and Arsenal in the race to get among Europe's elite.

Rodgers is on a 10-game unbeaten league run though Thursday's Europa Cup exit against Besiktas was costly because it closed one possible route to the Champions League and upset preparations with the players not returning to Merseyside until 4am on Friday morning. 

Brendan Rodgers says finishing in the top four this season would eclipse last year's achievements

Liverpool were knocked out of Europe in midweek, but have had a busier schedule this season 

He believes the club's early-season woes are behind them – they were 10th as recently as December - and says the players deserve credit for overcoming the loss of Luis Suarez, a long-term injury to Daniel Sturridge, the impending departure of Steven Gerrard, the extra demands of European competition and the difficulty in assimilating eight new signings made over the summer.

'If we arrive in the top four this year, with everything we have been though, it will be a greater achievement than last year. Absolutely,' said Rodgers.

'It was certainly an incredible achievement to go so close last year but we only had to play one game a week. Making the top four this year would certainly be better.

'Our backs were against the wall, we weren't playing very well and when you don't win games you get criticism. No one likes it but you have to accept it. There is no doubt this season we have leareda lot and by the end of it I will be a better manager.'

One of Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are set to miss out on Champions League football next season, a hammer blow to any of those huge clubs.

Rodgers claimed: 'I think there is probably a big pressure on Manchester United and Arsenal from where they've been probably over the last 15 to 20 years. 

Last season, with Luis Suarez in the team, Rodgers' side finished second behind Manchester City

'Manchester United is a club that has been synonymous with that and probably through to at least the quarter-finals of the competition. Arsene Wenger's record of getting them qualified has been outstanding. That is what you are up against. But I think it tells you the competition in this country. It's quite exciting really that you are fighting until the end.'

Liverpool's famous 3-2 win against City last April put them top of the Premier League and seven poitns clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side, though they did have two games in hand.

But a home defeat against Chelsea and draw at Crystal Palace cost them and they eventually fell two points short.

Rodgers insists he has been too busy to dwell on it this season but acknowledges it is something he could look back on in years to come.

Of more immediate importance is trying to get Liverpool back into the Champions League after this season's disappointment that saw them exit at the group stage. 'That is the priority,' says the manager.

Liverpool's reputation worldwide is second only to Manchester United largely due to their success in the 1970s and 80s but with Chelsea and Manchester City growing their fan bases, owner John W Henry needs to keep the club among the elite to protect his brand.

Liverpool take on champions City on Sunday hoping to keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester United 

United had to pay over the odds for the likes of Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera to compensate for missing out on the Champions League. 

Liverpool haven't got similar cash to burn on transfer fees or wages – they only escaped FPP punishment last week because they successfully argued part of their spending was for an expansion of their stadium.

'We are about developing and creating world-class talent. Liverpool is still talked about as a worldwide club, which is important,' he said.

Jordan Henderson is likely to return to the team for the crucial Premier League clash against Manchester City

Mario Balotelli, replaced by Rodgers on Thursday, is in the squad to face his former side on Sunday

'I think the top four looked a long way off from where we were but we always believed that once we could work together and have more working time together, we could challenge. Again it is the elite competition, the Champions League, it is where the best players and managers want to work and we put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity to do that.'

Jordan Henderson and Lazar Markovic are expected to return from the side that lost on penalties to Besiktas though Gerrard is still out with a hamstring problem.

There could be a place in the 18-man squad for Mario Balotelli who helped City win the league in 2012.
