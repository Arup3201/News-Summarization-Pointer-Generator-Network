George Osborne's wish to expand airport capacity near London, even if that means building a third runway at Heathrow, has sparked a furious reaction from fellow Tories.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said it would be a 'disaster' while Zac Goldsmith warned he 
would stand down at the next election if his party does not block expanding Britain's biggest airport.

Mr Osborne, who is in charge of election
 policy for the Tories, yesterday opened the door for the Conservatives to complete a sensational u-turn on the third runway issue.

Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at Heathrow and George Osborne sparked speculation there could be a u-turn on the issue

He is also said to be behind unconfirmed rumours that an independent panel of experts will now look at the issue, taking the decision out of MPs' hands.

Downing Street today also confirmed that a consultation on airports will be launched in the next few weeks, adding that advocates of Heathrow's expansion would be able to make their case.

'I think the arguments that are put forward in favour of Heathrow 
expansion are based on wild exaggerations,' Zac Goldsmith told BBC Radio 4's World 
at One.

'Heathrow is already one of the busiest airports in the world.'

The MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston went on: 'I think if we 
enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out 
expansion of Heathrow I think the Conservative Party will be very badly 
defeated in areas beneath the flightpath.

Anger: Tory Zac Goldsmith says he would stand down over the issue as he believes his party must protect those under the Heathrow flight path

'I personally would not want to stand as a Conservative candidate on a 
manifesto that is ambiguous on this issue. I think we need to be very 
very clear and honest with voters.'

Transport Secretary Justine Greening - 
whose Putney constituency lies under Heathrow flightpaths - has been a 
vociferous opponent of a third runway and it is thought that her fate in
 the Cabinet reshuffle this week may rest on the Prime Minister's plans 
for aviation policy.

Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said today that the 
Government's position was unchanged since the coalition agreement of 
2010, which committed ministers to scrapping plans drawn up by the 
previous Labour administration for a third runway at Heathrow.

But he confirmed that a consultation process would be announced within 
the next few weeks, with all sides being given the opportunity to put 
their views - including proponents of a third runway.

Controversial: George Osborne said yesterday that the south-east needs to expand its its air capacity, and that could include at Heathrow

The spokesman told reporters at a regular Westminster briefing: 'We said
 before the summer that we would come back to this issue in the autumn. 
We will do that in due course... We will say more about the process in 
the next few weeks.'

He added: 'The Government's position on the third runway is as set out in the coalition agreement.

'What the Chancellor said was that he believed that there was a case for
 additional capacity in the South-East and we should look at all the 
options.

'There are strong views about this issue on both sides of the argument. 
Any process must involve listening to those views and, therefore, I 
would expect all the options to be considered within that process.

'If we are going to listen to people's views, there are people who are 
making the case for the third runway who I am sure will make that case.

'There's a coalition programme for government that sets out the position
 on that, but I think there is going to be a debate about this issue and
 I would expect the people in favour of that proposal to put forward 
that proposal. The coalition programme commitment remains.'
