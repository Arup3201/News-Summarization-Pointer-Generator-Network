Astronomers have calculated the origin of a meteor that injured 1,000 people after breaking up over central Russia.

They used amateur video footage to plot the path of the  space rock that burned up over the city of Chelyabinsk causing shockwaves that blew out windows.

The results suggest the meteor belongs 
to a well known family of space rocks known as the Apollo asteroids, and probably came from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

The Chelyabinsk meteor (labelled ChM) appears to have been on elliptical orbit around the Sun before it collided with Earth. The orbits of Earth and Mars are shown, although the calculations included the rest of inner and outer planets.

Dozens of videos of the fireball were 
taken with camera phones, CCTV and car-dashboard cameras and put online, and the team found two in particular that helped then worked out exactly where it came from.

Using this amateur video footage, they were able to plot the meteor's trajectory through Earth's atmosphere and then reconstruct its orbit around the Sun.

'Using evidence gathered by one camera at the Revolution Square in the city of Chelyabinsk
and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of Korkino, we 
calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to 
reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent 
encounter with our planet,' said Jorge Zuluaga and Ignacio Ferrin, from the University of Antioquia in Medellin.

Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes  and measured 55 feet in diameter

'We use it to classify the meteoroid 
among the near Earth asteroid families Ô¨Ånding that the parent body 
belonged to the Apollo asteroids.'

Using the footage and the location of an
 impact into Lake Chebarkul, the team calculated the height, speed and 
position of the rock as it fell to Earth.

They estimate that it was travelling between 13km/s and 19km/s, brightening up above Korkin when it was between 32km and 47km high.

Early estimates of the meteor's mass 
put it at ten tonnes; US space agency Nasa later estimated it to be 
between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes. Nasa estimates the size of the object 
was about 17m (55ft).

The reconstruction uses three vantage points: the Revolution Square at Chelyabinsk (C), the Korkin metropolitan area (K) and Lake Chebarkul (L). The brightening point (BP) and the fragmentation point (FP) are the points of the trajectory seen from Chelyabinsk and measured using the shadow cast by the poles at the Revolutionary Square.

'In February 15 2013 a medium-sized meteoroid impacted the atmosphere in the region ofChelyabinsk, Russia,' the team wrote.

'After its entrance to the atmosphere and after travel by several hundred of kilometers the body exploded in a powerful event responsible for physical damages and injured people spread over a region enclosing several large cities.

'We present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid.'

Once they had discovered its trajectory, the researchers put their figures into astronomy software developed by the US Naval Observatory.

The results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as Apollo.

Of about 9,700 near-Earth asteroids discovered so far, about 5,200 are thought to be Apollos.

The Apollo asteroids are a class of asteroids with Earth-crossing orbits.

The first Apollo asteroid was discovered in 1918 by Max Wolf observing from Heidelberg, Germany

Asteroids are divided into different groups such as Apollo, Aten, or Amor, based on the type of orbit they have.

Dr Stephen Lowry, from the University of Kent, said the team had done well to publish so quickly.

'It certainly looks like it was a member of the Apollo class of asteroids,' he told BBC News.

'Its elliptical, low inclination orbit, indicates a solar system origin, most likely from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

'Perhaps with more data, we can determine roughly where in the asteroid belt it come from.'
