A famed New York dermatologist whose youthful face has been plastered on subway car ads for 30 years has released recent photos of himself - and it appears he needs his own skin specialist.

Dr Jonathan Zizmore, 69, whipped the internet into a frenzy this week after posting three current snaps revealing his wrinkled skin, sun spots and sagging jowls.

The less recognizable Zizmor photo went viral yesterday, with subway riders expressing shock online.

'That Zizmor (picture) is all of the mind explosions,' one observer tweeted. 'All of them.'

Zizmorâ€™s 'fix your face' ads have been a mainstay on New York trains since the 1980s, with the good doctor's taut and smiling face beaming down on commuters.

His frozen-in-time photo is normally set against colorful rainbows or the New York skyline in ads promising affordable skin care, and is believed to feature in one in every five subway cars.

The 'subway doctor' told Gothamist back in 2009  that he started putting his ads on the subway around 30 years ago.

'Why did I do it? In those days, dermatology 
was very exclusive, chic, chic. Most people, different ethnicity groups 
didn't even know there were dermatologists. I felt I wanted to open it 
up, treat people of all demographics and so on,' he said.

'And I really started 
doing that, from the very rich to the poor, black, white, whatever. So I
 was the only one on the subway for about 25 years.'

The subway ad

The New York native said he continues to use the outdated photo because it still drums up some business.

'Well I keep doing it because it works and people think I'm not in practice anymore if I'm not in the subways,' he said.

'And it reinforces cause subway ads, you saw someone ten years ago, it reinforces. But we're not in it as much.'

The skin doctor still rides the subway and is recognized on occasion. But now that the current snaps on medical website ZocDoc have gone viral, it's likely he will be stopped more often.

However Zizmor has never kept his aging complexion a secret.

The Albert Einstein College of Medicine graduate has appeared in several TV ads over the years in which we've watched him age. Some of the ads are shared in this story.
