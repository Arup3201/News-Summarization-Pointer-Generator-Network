Investigators hunting kidnapped British tourist Judith Tebbutt were last night checking claims Islamist fanatics are threatening to use her as a ‘human shield’.

An Al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia claimed she was being held to deter further attacks after a U.S. drone bombed their base 11 days ago, killing dozens of suspected terrorists.

The Islamists, styling themselves as terror group Ras Kamboni, also threatened to parade their terrified hostage as a trophy at a press conference, it was reported.

Mrs Tebbutt, 56, has been missing since Saturday night when a gang raided the beach hut in exclusive Kenyan resort Kiwayu Safari Village, where she was staying with her publisher husband David, 58.

He was shot dead before they whisked her by speedboat towards Somalia, just 18 miles away.

David Cameron said yesterday the Government was ‘doing everything we possibly can on this desperately tragic case’. Scotland Yard and British intelligence officers were assessing the claims of Ras Kamboni, a faction of the Al Shabaab group controlling southern Somalia.

The gang offered no proof as to whether they were truly holding the mother-of-one. 

But Shielk Abdul Rahman Dehere, one of its leaders, claimed she was  seized in answer to an attack from an U.S. drone on one of its weapons stores in Kismayo, 328 miles south-west of Somali capital Mogadishu.

He said: ‘We do not wish to harm her, we would not kill an innocent woman… but any further attack of force, we will kill the lady.’

Dehere spoke in a telephone call to a
 Somali Nairobi-based journalist who built links with Al Shabaab during 
the kidnapping of Britons Paul and Rachel Chandler. He added: ‘The lady 
is not feeling well.

She is not talking. She is finding it hard to speak. Her health is good but she is traumatised.’

Separately,
 an Al Shabaab radio broadcast claimed that it was the group holding Mrs
 Tebbutt, and that her husband had been killed because he refused to 
obey their orders.

No 
ransom demand has been received, and no trace found in Kenya of Mrs 
Tebbutt.

The social worker, who wears a hearing aid, was reportedly 
taken to Marka, an Al Shabaab heartland 45 miles south west of 
Mogadishu.

She is said to have been moved at 
least twice since then.

The Somalia Report news agency claimed she would
 be paraded at a ‘press conference’, an ordeal suffered several times by
 the Chandlers.

Yesterday Al Shabaab denied having 
anything to do with the murder and kidnapping, but made no mention of 
its shadowy faction Ras Kamboni. Experts say no pirate could operate in 
southern Somalia without Al Shabaab’ s authority.

Islamist militants are believed to be holding Judith Tebbutt in Kismayo, along the coast from the resort of Kiwayu where she was seized

Ali Shebwana, leader of the village where the couple, from Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire had been staying, said: ‘They will not harm her as she has value only if she is alive.’

Last night Kenyan police arrested a second man over the kidnapping. He is suspected of being an associate of the first suspect, handyman Ali Babitu, who used to work at the resort.

Both men are being questioned in custody and have apparently admitted helping the raiders under duress, after themselves being held at gunpoint.

ALLAN MALLINSON: 'Special Forces are for strategic objectives; to use them for anything less than strategic effect is to 'break windows with guineas', as the elder Pitt was accused of doing with his abortive raids on the French coast.

'I’m sorry if I now appear to be using this sad event to make a point about defence cuts, but we might just bear in mind that SF recruit from within the services. The fewer the men in the army, the smaller the pool from which the SAS can recruit. It’s as simple as that.'
