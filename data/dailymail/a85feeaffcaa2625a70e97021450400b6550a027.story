Gareth Bale hit the post with an effort from around 50 yards out during Real Madrid's 1-0 defeat by Athletic Bilbao on Saturday evening but the question is: Did he mean it?

With the Spanish giants trailing 1-0 at San Mames, the Welshman produced what looked like an audacious repeat of David Beckham's famous lob for Manchester United against Wimbledon back in 1996.

The ball flew through the air and caught Bilbao goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz completely off guard before dipping and smacking the post; much to the disappointment of Javier Hernandez who raised his arms to celebrate before being beaten to the rebound by a defender.

Much debate arose on social media over whether Real Madrid's wing wizard had meant to shoot or cross

The shot soon caused debate among fans on social media with some reckoning the kick was a cross which went horribly awry rather than a direct effort at goal.

Whether Bale meant it or not, had the ball sailed in it would surely have been up there with some of the wideman's finest strikes.

Beckham's successful attempt from such a distance is one of the finest, most memorable goals of the Premier League era.

Aged just 21, Beckham received the ball in his own half and spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line before producing a stunning strike from the halfway line which flew perfectly into the back of the net.

Meanwhile, defeat for Carlo Ancelotti's side on Saturday means Barcelona can leapfrog Los Blancos at the top of the La Liga table with a win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.
