A laboratory technician was alleged to have killed her two young daughters with toxic concoction before taking her own life in a triple death tragedy.

The mother, named locally as Heena Solanki, is understood to have first killed her two daughters Jasmine, aged nine years, and Prisha, aged four years, and then herself at their smart semi-detached home.

The children's father is believed to have made the grim discovery of the trio's bodies.

Moments after paramedics and police arrived, neighbours said they  to close all their doors and windows, saying that there had been a 'chemical incident' at the house.

Today detectives from the Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Serious Crime and Command were examining the five-bedroom house.

A spokesman for the police said detectives were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths, which they said were being treated as 'unexplained.'

Today a number of house windows were 
wide open for ventilation despite the rain and cool temperatures. The 
£600,000 pebble-dashed home remained cordoned off.

A police forensic tent had been erected on the driveway and scenes of crime officers were seen carrying bags full of evidence from the property. Two silver cars were parked on the driveway.

Neighbours said Heena worked as a laboratory technician and was married to Kalpesh, 42.

On her Facebook page, she stated that she studied at South Gujarat University until 2002.

One elderly neighbour who did not want to be named, said 'Last night the police were knocking on doors telling everyone to get inside and close their windows because there had been a chemical incident.

'There were fire engines and ambulances as well as police.

'They were here until the early hours,' he said.

'They were a lovely family. The kids used to run around and play outside, always very happy.

'My wife is very upset. It's heartbreaking. They were lovely children. The mother worked in a laboratory.'

A woman living nearby, who also asked 
not to be named, said: 'They were a lovely family and the children were 
brought up very well. They always made an effort to greet you. It's all 
very sad.'

The bodies of the woman and the two children were taken away earlier today in private ambulances.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that post mortem examinations were likely to take place next week.

A
spokesman for London Ambulance Service said that crews were alerted to 
an address in Midcroft, Ruislip, West London, at 6.40pm yesterday/ on
