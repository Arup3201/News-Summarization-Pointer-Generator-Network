A man who taunted police by creating his own wanted poster and put it online has been jailed for 16 months after police finally caught up with him.

Anthony Swinburn, 28, had been on the run for nine months after absconding from court while awaiting sentencing for common assault and theft.

He put a mock-up wanted poster in the style of something from a western onto Facebook and he was put on the force's most wanted list.

Longford Police announced his arrest with a cheeky tweet saying his wish was their command

He boasted online about enjoying a top-of-the-range Sky TV package and his girlfriend's alleged cannabis habit.

Swinburn also changed his name on Facebook to 'Bonnie Clyde' in a bid to mock police's efforts to catch him.

For weeks, Swinburn bragged about his 
life on the run via a string of updates on Facebook.

Entries included 
the snowy weather, bets on football matches and even his efforts to lose
weight.

In one message he described how he was about to tuck into a steak, onion rings, chicken wings and fries.

But he was back in court this week after being arrested last month - a day after he had boasted on Facebook about being wanted by police.

The Twitter account for Longford Police stated after his arrest: 'Man who posted his own wanted poster online is now in custody. His wish was our command!'

Swinburn, from Coventry, was at Warwick Crown Court last November waiting to be sentenced for stealing beer from Tesco when he decided to go on the run.

He was subject of an eight month suspended sentence for aggravated vehicle taking and theft when he committed an offence of harassment.

He pleaded not guilty to two new charges of racially aggravated common assault, but guilty to racially aggravated harassment, when back in the dock this week.

The court heard Swinburn had gone into the One Stop Shop in Binley Woods in January last year, picked up a pack of cans of Strongbow cider and left without paying.

When staff checked the CCTV recording they also saw Swinburn had carried out an identical theft earlier in the day, again taking a pack of Strongbow worth Â£14.

Following his arrest, he was bailed, only to steal a pack of Budweiser from Tesco in Leamington Spa later the same month.

When apprehended, he denied acting dishonesty, claiming he believed a woman with him, who also had a pack, was going to get hers scanned twice while he waited outside.

Defending Swinburn, Tom Schofield described him as a 'nice lad'.

He said: 'There are lots of reasons to give up and send him to prison, but although he has repeatedly fallen off the wagon, it is a wagon that is still running.

'I would ask you to pass another suspended sentence, with all the risks that carries. His problem is alcohol, but when he's not in drink, he is actually quite a nice lad.'

Judge Marten Coates was not swayed by his plea and jailed Swinburn, saying: 'Your barrister asks me to give you a chance, but you appear at this court for breaching a suspended sentence on a number of occasions.

'You've had your chances and it's time to draw a line under your offences.'
