A very welcome antidote to another  rainy day at London Fashion Week, Jasper Conran kicked off day two with a lesson in how to dress a woman.

The designer, who believes fashion has become 'rather shapeless' lately, was on a mission to flatter the female form and his AW14 collection of silhouette dresses, cashmere coats with relaxed shoulders and shrunken jackets did just that.

Speaking about the Jasper Conran woman, the designer told MailOnline: 'She is female as opposed to feminine, she's curved, she's got feminine attributes; she's unashamedly that.

'It's wearable clothes for powerful women with a lot of sexiness.'

Powerful but sexy: Jasper Conran kicked off day two of London Fashion Week at the Saatchi Gallery this morning with his undeniably feminine AW14 collection

Jet black, silk-lined dresses with sexy cutaway backs, sculpted dresses in pared back tones and buttery leather jackets were the order of the day at the Saatchi Gallery.

Jasper's aim was to create an easy and wearable collection, 'You can wear it to the office and then out at night. You can put the jacket over the top of the sequin dress to cover up and then take it off when you hit the town,' he explained.

It's all about the coats: Edge-to-edge coats were the stars of the catwalk and they came in the omnipresent sugar spun pink

Edge-to-edge coats were the stars of the catwalk and they came in black, grey, blonde and sugar spun pink with instinctively belted waists.

'It's the idea of being able to slip them off, it's the idea of dressing up - there's a comfort juxtaposed against that sort of saucy underneath piece. It's all about confidence on top and hotness underneath,' he said.

Double-faced cashmere, delicately soft leathers and silk tule dresses with a 'quadruple stretch' reigned supreme- but the forceful jolts of geranium red were what took the audience by surprise amidst an otherwise neutral pallete.

'I thought, well, we need some orange here. But I would call it reddish orange - it is a particularly good colour,' said Jasper.

Adding some shape: Jasper believes that fashion has gone slightly shapeless lately and his mission is to emphasise the female form

Accessories were kept to a minimum with just one envelope bag and a mid-high heel because 'if I was a women I would want that, it's as simple as that,' according to the man himself.

Front row regular Hilary Alexander was most impressed with what she witnessed this morning.

Speaking about the collection, she said: 'It was vintage Jasper. I loved that little navy cashmere sweater and that navy striped skirt. I think it would sell extremely well and the coats were great.

'The bra dress with a swingback jacket in orange was lovely; the whole collection was very easy.'

He's been around so long, he's practically part of the furniture but on this showing, it seems unlikely that London will ever get bored of John Rocha.

His razor-sharp grasp of technical detail and gloriously romantic vision were once again in evidence, with his signature ruffles and judicious use of colour drawing appreciative gasps from the watching fashion pack.

Intricate: With his razor-sharp grasp of technical detail and gloriously romantic vision, how could we ever tire of John Rocha?

Embellishment appeared in the form of applique flowers that bloomed across bodices and trailed gently down skirts, while dresses that could have been dull were given a shot in the arm with eye-catching rosettes and sculpted hemlines.

Lovely though they were, the highlight was surely a stunning tiered crimson cocktail dress, styled with a matching hat, that blazed a feather-like trail down the body.

Texture: Dresses that could have been dull were given a shot in the arm with eye-catching rosettes, sculpted hemlines and a whole lot of texture

Other high points in the dress heavy show included a delicate feathered dress and a spectacular ruffled skirt suit in steel grey. While the colours were muted, with black, grey and crimson reigning supreme, the textured silhouettes more than made up for it.

With daughter Simone showing later on this week, John proved, once again, that while there might be two designers named Rocha, neither are to be missed.

As for beauty, nail supremo Shreen Gayle layered Essie's Bobbing For Baubles with Chinchilla and topping it off with Matte About You.
