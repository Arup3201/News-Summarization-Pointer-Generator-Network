Patrons complaining that the sight of other customers wearing sweaty cycle clothing puts them off their food has prompted a hotel to ban the controversial lycra attire.

Raffles hotel in Perth has done a complete backflip on its stance about allowing lycra-clad cyclists to dine in the venue as a sign was put up over the weekend declaring the right to refuse those wearing the fitted clothing.

This comes just a week after four riders were refused service by a waiter due to their acquired look on Sunday January 4, and hotel management posted a clarification on Facebook insisting that the issue was not about their fashion sense but with the potential hazard of the parked bikes.

But the venue quickly changed its tune after an overwhelming number of disgusted patrons responded to the post saying they lose their appetites when laying eyes on the 'Lycra'd loonies'.

Raffles Hotel in Perth decided to ban lycra-clad cyclists after patrons complained about their fitted attire

The policy states it can also refuse people who are not wearing neat casual attire including high-visibility clothing, dirty work wear and board shorts

The sign states that management can refuse people who aren't wearing neat casual attire including board shorts, high-visibility clothing, dirty work wear and lycra cycle wear.

Colonial Leisure Group State operations manager Vern Fogarty told The West Australian that the descision was made after the social media response supporting such a ban.  

Last Monday, management posted that the real issue was with the bikes potentially causing a safety hazard along the footpath and encouraged cyclists to lobby the council for more bike racks outside the venue.

'This decision was never a dress code issue, and if dress was communicated as the reason by our staff then we apologise for the misunderstanding and assure everyone that this is not the case,' the hotel posted on its Facebook page.

Described as the 'Lycra'd loonies', patrons lashed out on the post not only complaining about the revealing look but also the smell and sweat that they claim is left behind on the seats.

'Lycra'd loonies, after pedalling around the countryside for hours, tend to get a bit on the nose, and there's nothing worse than a bunch smelly, sweaty cyclists sitting near you to put you off your tucker, one patron said.

'A good move by the publican, but he'd better be ready for a flood of these Lycra'd loonies descending on him just to get some publicity.'

Matt Mcguire said that he was at the pub on Saturday when three lycra clad riders came in for lunch.

'All fat in tight clothes thinking they are gunna be the next lance Armstrong. Ban them all from entering places like that it puts you off your food.'

Riki Barron was also all for the lycra ban.

'Surely the issue is with old men..............not bike racks! good on ya raffles for banning them. Lycra isn't acceptable clothing,' he posted.

Social media users also complained that cyclists leave sweat on the seats at pubs and cafes

The cyclists have been described as 'Lycra'd loonies' with one patron suggesting they open up their own cafe

While Kev Parkinson decided to share some practical tips with the cyclists.

'If you're riding for exercise, wear loose clothing, you'll get more wind resistance and a better workout. You won't look as ridiculous and can stop for food wherever you like mostly.'

'If you're racing then by all means, wear lycra for the aerodynamics, but you don't have time to stop for a hot milk drink.'

Drew Jones suggested that the riders to 'stick to coffee shops'. 

Who wants to see fat old men having some mid-life fitness crisis busting their fat guts while parading their tackle at my eye level when I take a seat,' he posted.

'Although we all appreciate that you have taken the initiative to get fit please be considerate of others.

'Your clothing is quite revealing you have just ridden countless kilometres in the sun and some not all of you are on the nose.'

Carmen Louise Stone echoed those sentiments.

'Why don't you do the polite thing like the rest of us and get out of your smelly exercise clothes and have a shower before heading somewhere for a pint or coffee?' she posted.

'I don't head to a restaurant or a coffee bar straight after the gym and I would be refused so why should you be treated differently because you have a hot shot bike and fancy clothes?' 

David Wilson suggested that cyclists open their own cafe.

'That way the rest of the public dont need to sit in the sweat of cyclists mid way through their exercise,' he said.

'Don't really want to have coffee while 5 men walk past with their lycra clad junk at eye level either.'

 Ross Powell, along with his wife and two friends, were denied service at Raffles hotel for wearing lycra

The age-old issue resurfaced its ugly head on Sunday morning when outraged customers were denied their regular Sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra.

Ross Powell walked into the Raffles hotel to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates, who had all just gone on a morning cycle, when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark.

'Sorry mate you can't come in here - we've got a no lycra-free policy - we can't serve you,' the waiter said.  

Mr Powell was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire. 

'I've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating,' Mr Powell told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - I've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes I was wearing.' 

His wife, Colleen Powell, questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago.

'My wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away,' he said.

Mr Powell insists the move is blatant discrimination.

'I think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and don't like the older crowd as a general rule,' he said.

'People don't like the way we look.' 

'It would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing.'

Hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked

Daily Mail Australia approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back.

However, Colonial Leisure Group State operations manger Vern Fogarty denied there was a lycra ban to The West Australian saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk.

'It is not our dress standard,' he told the paper. 

'We've served cyclists in lycra in the past and we're happy to serve cyclists in lycra in the future.' 

Mr Fogarty said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff.

But Mr Powell said the hotel's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued. 

'It's an absolute smokescreen - it's just spin,' he said. 

'There was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy.'

Animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and Mr Powell, who owns the Canning Bridge Cycles shop in Perth, said everybody needed to 'take a chill pill'.

'We all need to get along - the roads are for both cars and bikes,' he said. 

Mr Powell said he called the hotel on Monday and was told he would be contacted that afternoon following a management meeting about the matter but was yet to hear back.

Mr Powell, who owns Canning Bridge Cycles, called for the animosity towards cyclists to be put to an end
