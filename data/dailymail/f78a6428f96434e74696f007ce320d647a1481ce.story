West Ham United forward Diafra Sakho will not face retrospective punishment from the FA after allegedly headbutting Luke Shaw. 

Manchester United’s sense of injustice over Wayne Rooney’s red card on Saturday had been heightened by their private view that defender Shaw was a victim of an attack. 

The left back was fielding a shining black eye after the win at Old Trafford but, after reviewing video footage, the offence wasn't deemed serious enough to warrant a red card had the referee seen it at the time.

The FA reviewed the footage of the game and adjudged that Sakho didn't have a case to answer

United would not comment publicly on the matter but at one stage in the second-half Shaw was seen remonstrating with a linesman who he clearly felt should have picked up the incident. 

Lee Mason hadn't included the incident in his post-match report, allowing the FA to review. 

Shaw was also critical of the decision to send off Rooney and claimed his tackle was no worse than a trip on him by Sakho earlier in the game.

'We have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza’s red card as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn’t stop play,' said Shaw.

'Earlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me.

'But I just focus on winning games and I’ll keep doing that.'
