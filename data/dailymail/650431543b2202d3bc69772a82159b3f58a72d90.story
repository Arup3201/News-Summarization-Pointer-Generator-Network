A New York woman has filed a discrimination lawsuit against Kuwait Airways after the airline refused to allow her to fly on one of its planes because she is an Israeli citizen.

Iris Eliazrov, who moved to the U.S at the age of 11 and is now 26, was barred from the flight at John F. Kennedy International Airport because of a Kuwait Airways policy that prevents Israeli citizens from flying with the airline.

The mother-of-four's lawsuit has gained momentum in recent days after Federal Judge Roslynn Mauskopf ordered Brooklyn attorney U.S. general Loretta Lynch and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to consider its merits.

Kuwait Airways' policy of not allowing Israeli citizens to fly on its planes has come under fire from an enraged mother-of-four from Brooklyn

Mrs Eliazrov and her husband David Nektalov - who flies on a U.S. passport - were due to fly to London on November 1.

But the company policy meant she had to re-book with another flying operator while her husband went ahead.

Mr Nektalov told the New York Daily News: 'I didn’t think a discrimination like this could exist in America, in JFK (Airport), in New York City. Sixty years ago blacks weren’t allowed to ride buses. This is not about money.'

His wife's lawsuit claims the policy is reminiscent of the Holocaust and the Civil Rights movement.

Lawyer John Maggio, representing the airline, claimed Mrs Eliazrov's claim was baseless because the company's policy centred on citizenship, not religion, adding that a Muslim with an Israeli passport would not be allowed to fly.

He likened the policy to the U.S. embargo on its companies undertaking business dealings with Iran.

However, Mrs Eliazrov's lawsuit is not the first time Kuwait Airways has come under fire for a policy many label as discriminatory.

Mrs Eliazrov's husband David Nektalov said he was astounded such 'discrimination' could exist at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (pictured)

A similar situation unfolded in September last year when a 32-year-old Israeli woman was denied her seat on a Kuwait Airways plane to London.

At the time, lawyers for Kuwait Airways said that the ban was required by the country's law because it has no diplomatic relations with Israel.

They clarified that they were happy for Jewish passengers to fly - just not Israeli citizens, Fox News reported.

Kuwait Airways have not commented on the lawsuit.
