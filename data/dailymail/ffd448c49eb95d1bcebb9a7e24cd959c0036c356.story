Teachers should be allowed to show Prophet Mohammed cartoons in school as part of a national curriculum on the Europe massacres caused by the images, Danish politicians have said.

In January, 12 people at the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo which reprinted Danish cartoons, and later created some of their own, were shot dead in a jihadist attack on their Paris offices.

And the Danish newspaper which originally printed 12 satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005 sparked protests in parts of the Islamic world. The paper received death threats.

Mai Mercado, a Conservative People's Party spokeswoman, wrote in the daily Jyllands-Posten: 'The cartoon crisis, the Charlie Hebdo killings and the latest terrorist attack in Copenhagen on February 14 are such an important part of history they should have a permanent place on the school curriculum.'

However, she stressed that teachers would be free to choose whether or not to show the cartoons themselves, as long as the topic was discussed.

'Politically we don't regulate the details of what students are taught, that's an old tradition to make sure that Danish schools are kept free from political interference.'

But she added that if teachers refused to show the cartoons she was 'convinced the students would go home and run a Google search because students are curious'.

The Conservatives were shown as having 5.3per cent of voter support in a poll this week, meaning it would be the second smallest party in parliament if elections were held today.

But the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party (DPP), which was ranked third with 19.6per cent support by the same poll, went even further, saying that showing the cartoons should be mandatory in schools.

'If you live in Denmark you should also be able to tolerate seeing the drawings,' party spokesman Alex Ahrendtsen told the daily Berlingske.

However, the head of Denmark's teachers' union, Anders Bondo Christensen, said that he believed it should be up to each teacher to decide whether and how to talk about the controversial drawings.

An appropriate way to discuss them could be to 'perhaps invite some Muslim children's parents to explain why it provokes' them, he told news agency Ritzau.
