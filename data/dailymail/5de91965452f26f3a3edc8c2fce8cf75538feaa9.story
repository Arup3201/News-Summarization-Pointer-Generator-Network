Some of the world’s weirdest properties can be found in New York City - but this really could be the craziest of them all.

Jeremy Noritz, 32, has created an amazing retro-futuristic submarine fantasy inside an apartment in the trendy Chelsea region of Manhattan.

The two-bedroom property is on the market for $1.75million and has already been generating attention since it was listed on Tuesday.

The impressive apartment is described by real estate brokerage Core as having ‘a Jules Verne meets Tim Burton sensibility’.

It features a submarine-style door and a giant Zeppelin that dangles from the ceiling and produces white light at day and rainbow light at night, reported the New York Post.

There are also pulleys, antique pipes, wrenches, tools designed as cabinet handles, miniature planes and big old wooden casts.

The property is expected to interest retro-futurists inspired by author William Gibson, known as ‘Steam Punks’, reported the New York Post.

The movement, which imagines a world run by 19th century computers, is coming back after it faded out in the 1990s.

Mr Noritz said he is selling the property because he is going on a journey to Oregon and California, driving a camper van.

He told the New York Post he will be accompanied by his two cats and bought the flat for $1.3 million four years ago.

The screenwriter previously worked as a welder, which gave him the inspiration to create the 500ft ‘workshop where I could live and work’.

‘The space plays with your expectations,’ he told the New York Post.
