Crowds will once again flock inside the Colosseum, after the Italian government backed plans to rebuild the ancient amphitheatre's  arena floor.

Some 1,500 years after barbarians were devoured by wild beasts for the crowd's enjoyment, Dario Franceschini, the Italian culture minister, said that people should be able to 'enjoy monuments by bringing them to life'.

Currently the labyrinthine corridors and cells for wild animals and slaves that were built under the arena lie exposed after excavations in the last couple of centuries.

The Colosseum in Rome is to be used as an entertainment venue once again after the Italian government backed plans to rebuild the ancient amphitheatre's sandy arena

But 19th century photographs that reveal how the arena floor would have looked intact give visitors much more of a sense of where the fighting and executions took place, archeologists say.

Mr Franceschini said the reconstructed arena where 35,000 watched fights, executions and animal hunts could be used for 'classical concerts, theatrical spectacles or productions of ancient plays', although he drew the lines at football matches.

He told a press conference in Rome yesterday: 'I am convinced that with an intelligent reconstruction of the arena of the Colosseum, the symbol of this country, it could become much much more attractive.'

'Imagine the beauty of going up in the original lifts that could have carried gladiators up to the arena and seeing the Colosseum from the centre as they would have seen it.'

Archaeologist Daniele Manacorda, pictured,  said the plan to replace the arena's long-disappeared floor is aimed at restoring the Colosseum to its original state so visitors can better appreciate its ancient splendor

'We are not talking about Bayern v Roma, but if we choose classical music concerts, ancient plays, spectacles that have an enormous commercial value clearly in terms of the TV rights'.

Earlier he tweeted images of plans by archeologist Professor Daniele Manacorda of Roma Tre adding: 'All it will take is a bit of courage.'

Archaeologist Daniele Manacorda of Roma Tre university said his suggestion to replace the arena's long-disappeared floor is aimed at restoring the Colosseum to its original state so visitors can better appreciate its ancient splendor — not turning it into a heavily trafficked concert venue.

'It's the most normal idea in the world,' Manacorda said. 

Critics have feared the Colosseum would be turned into a venue for rock concerts, viewed as both unbefitting of its stature as an ancient wonder and likely to inflict damage to the structure already weakened by earthquakes, notably in 443 and most recently in the 1700s.

Visitors entering the Colosseum today can look down into the stadium's labyrinthine belly to the rooms where bears and lions were once caged, and where gladiators prepared for mortal battle. 

Those utilitarian spaces were covered by the wooden floor of the arena itself during the nearly five centuries that the Colosseum functioned as a center of entertainment, with spectacles including exotic animal hunts and sea-battle re-enactments. 

Italians are not in principle against using their ancient monuments as backdrops for entertainment. Verona's Arena, a Roman amphitheater, attracts thousands each summer to its opera series, and performances are set regularly among the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. 

The Colosseum itself has housed occasional performances, and is visited every year by the pope during the Stations of the Cross.

The Colosseum, however, enjoys a unique status as the most predominant symbol not only of Rome, but of Italy, making sensitive any discussion about altering the status quo.

'It is so important and bulky in its presence, that to transition it into a venue where you perform opera is beneath its dignity,' said Giorgio Croci, a structural engineer who is one of Italy's leading experts on the Colosseum.

'The image of the Colosseum needs to remain beyond that practical use. It needs to remain an icon, a point of reference with all its history and its past.'
