British mobile phone users are now able to call home and surf the internet while abroad without incurring extra charges.

From today, Three has become the first UK mobile phone operator to allow holidaymakers to text and call the UK as well as go online within their current deal.

However, the 'Feel at Home ' scheme has currently only been rolled out to selected countries across the globe and popular holiday destinations including France, Spain and the U.S are missing.

British mobile phone users are now able to call home and surf the internet while abroad without incurring extra charges for the first time. Three became the first UK mobile phone operator to allow holidaymakers to text and call the UK, as well as go online, within their current deal

The scheme allows Three customers to use their phones in selected locations as if they are still in the UK, without getting billed extra for international roaming charges.

Three's scheme starts today for customers
travelling to the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong 
Kong, Sweden and Denmark.

The service will automatically activate as soon as the phone enters any of these countries and picks up a local network.

For many people, this will open up the prospect of using mapping services to navigate unfamiliar cities as well as social media sites to connect with friends back home without having to worry about being hit was a huge bill when they return home.

Consumers will hope the move will spark a war among mobile phone network providers to let people use their phones abroad without worrying about the consequences.

Three's 'Feel at Home' scheme has only been rolled out to seven countries across the globe but it is hoped the move could lead to no international roaming charges.

Three describes it as ‘a new, simple and affordable way to stay in touch with friends and family back home while travelling overseas’.

Customers with pay monthly contracts, pay-as-you-go and SIM-only packages, mobile broadband and business plans can use the service.

However, customers who exceed their minutes or data allowance included in their price plan while abroad in any one of the seven countries will be subject to reduced roaming rates.

People who make a call to a non-UK number will still be charged at the full roaming rate and tethering is not allowed under the scheme.
