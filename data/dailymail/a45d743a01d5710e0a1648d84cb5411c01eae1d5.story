A couple have been arrested for allegedly stealing food and cleaning products – after a trail of washing powder led straight to their house.

Thieves swiped an estimated £1,300 of supplies from the Atherton & Leigh Foodbank in Greater Manchester last weekend.

But volunteers spotted a trail of detergent leading to a nearby address. Police later arrested a man, 42, and woman, 38, on suspicion of theft.

The food, which was stored in a container behind St John the Baptist Church in Market Place, Atherton, was stolen some time between Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  

Foodbank secretary Dave Hughes said: 'This is a theft from the people who have donated items as well as people who are in crisis.'

'They are probably the type of people that we are there for and serve in emergencies. It may well be that we have helped these people in the past.

'It makes you wonder why they are so desperate for the money — and there have been a lot of break-ins in Atherton in the last two weeks by the sounds of it.

'Everybody around Atherton knows that the foodbank is located there because they see us going into the container with food.

'These people knew exactly what they were stealing.

The pair also damaged the locks on a storage container that must now be repaired. 

A police spokesman said: 'We were called on Sunday morning to reports of a burglary.

'A 42-year-old man and 38-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of theft and bailed until March 10.'
