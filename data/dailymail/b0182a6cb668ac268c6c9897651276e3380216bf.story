A young boy not only achieved his dream of playing against his Major League Soccer heroes - he scored the winning goal to take his team to victory.

Soccer fanatic Atticus Lane-Dupre, eight, who has survived kidney cancer, became the hero of the hour when he fired the ball into the back of the net no less than four times during a match against the Portland Timbers.

Atticus was cheered on by a crowd of 3,000 as he scored the fourth and winning goal with just seconds to spare before the whistle blew on the game, which was organised by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Dream come true: Atticus Lane-Dupre (second from right), eight, who has cancer, scored the winning goal as he and his youth team played against Major League Soccer side Portland Timbers

Overjoyed: It was Atticus' wish to play soccer against the side

The third grader powered his Green Machine side to a 10-9 victory against the MLS franchise at the Timbers' home stadium in Portland, according to a report in the Oregonian.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation is dedicated to making wishes come true for children battling life-threatening conditions.

For Atticus, who has been a fan of soccer since he first learned to walk, that wish was for he and his Green Machine teammates to line out against the Portland Timbers at Jeld Wen Field.

Atticus' mother said at the game, which was attended by thousands of chanting supporters: 'I'm overwhelmed.

'I just think it's so exciting that he gets to be with his heroes and gets to play this game,' she added.

Soundly beaten: The Major League side were no match for Atticus and his teammates, as they were cheered to victory by the roaring crowd

The Timbers made sure Atticus and his teammates were treated to the full MLS experience, and organised a special locker for the eight-year-old at the stadium, containing a Timbers kit with his name on the jersey.

'It was fun,' the Sunnyside 
Environmental School pupil said after the match, adding that his 
favourite goal was not the match-winner, but the one he put through the 
legs of Timbers midfielder Will Johnson.

Atticus had one kidney removed following his cancer diagnosis in the autumn of 2011.

His father Bert described his son's prognosis as good.
