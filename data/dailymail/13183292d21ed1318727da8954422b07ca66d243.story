Office workers lucky enough to be based in London's latest development will be spoiled for views of some the city's most famous landmarks from their very own park in the sky - from not one, but six decks.

When completed, Verde SW1 will be 150ft high and will boast a 20,000sq/ft rooftop, set across six landscaped roof terraces. Collectively the decks would take up almost half of a football field, which is around 77,000sq/ft. 

Workers will be able to look out over Buckingham Palace and the Royal Parks.
