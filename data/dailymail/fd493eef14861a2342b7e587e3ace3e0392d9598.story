A British self-proclaimed freedom fighter accused of illegally marrying up to 12 women in Europe and Asia is being investigated by Malaysian Special Branch officers, it was revealed today.

Police have named the traveller as Robert Andrew Scott, but say he also uses the Muslim name Jamaluddin Mustafa and is usually seen in Islamic robes.

Now understood to be living on the Malaysian island of Penang, 43-year-old Scott has been accused by women who have come forward to the police of duping his wives into caring for him, taking their money, then moving on to another woman.

Special Branch assistant director-general Ayob Pitchay has told Malaysian media that most of the women targeted by Scott were professionals such as bank officers and university lecturers.

Mr Pitchay said he understood that Scott was once involved in a missionary movement in London and had joined a mujahiddin - freedom fighters - group in Bosnia.

The officer said he had learned of a report that Scott had been held for the murder of a doctor in Bosnia but family members - it is not known which family - had successfully filed an application for his release.

'While he has been involved in militant work in Bosnia, he has not shown such tendencies while in Malaysia,' said Mr Pitchay.

'We are monitoring his marriages and what his real motives are,' said Mr Pitchay, confirming that Scott's alleged wives were of several different nationalities. Two that he had divorced recently were said to be Malaysian.

Writers who have come forward anonymously on Facebook allege that the exact number of his wives is unknown because Scott never divorces them officially through the authorities.

'Some victims truly believe there are more than 10,' claimed one writer, who described Scott as a 'heretical and deviant Muslim’. 

Further claims against Scott say that he is a 'manipulator of emotions' who will try to coax innocent women into having pre-marital sex and then within a matter of weeks will pressure them to marry 'in haste'.

Once married, alleges a writer, he will brainwash the wife by twisting Islam and ordering her to obey the husband at all costs.

Police are now investigating claims that he has taken large amounts of money from his wives before deserting them, even though they have had children by him.
