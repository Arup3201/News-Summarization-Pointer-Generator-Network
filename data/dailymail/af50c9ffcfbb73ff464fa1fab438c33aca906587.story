Jose Mourinho has given his players permission to let their hair down following Wednesday night's clash against West Ham.

Off the back of Sunday's euphoric Capital One Cup Final win over Tottenham, the Blues are straight back into action against the Hammers on Wednesday.

Mourinho says his players' celebrations after the Wembley win were subdued due to the prospect of facing West Ham.

But the Blues boss will give his squad two days off after the West Ham clash and has given them permission to enjoy themselves.

Mourinho said: 'Maybe they went out with some family for dinner [after Wembley], but I don't think they did any crazy things because, the next day, I saw them in very good condition.

'They will have Thursday and Friday off, and I told them those are the best moments if they want to do something that people at their age sometimes like to do.

'But they enjoyed it so much after the game on the pitch and in the dressing room, but even on the bus going back to Stamford Bridge was a normal journey.'

Looking ahead to Wednesday's clash at Upton Park, the Blues boss remained focused on the job at hand as they look to hold onto their Premier League and Champions League title hopes. 

'Big, difficult game on Wednesday. Big, difficult game next week in the Champions League [against Paris Saint Germain]. We are just happy. Everybody likes to win competitions.'

Asked if captain John Terry will sort out new contract terms before the end of the season, Mourinho was certain in his response but admitted he is thinking ahead to life after the 34-year-old.

'Yes, it will be [extended] before the end of the season for sure. What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that. 

'Every one of these big guys is difficult to replace, but at the same time you still have the player and he is still an important player, you have to start thinking: 'What next?

'But this is a process that we can take our time over because John is proving again this season that he's a player for years.'

Depending on Manchester City's result against Leicester on Wednesday, Chelsea can either increase their lead or maintain a five point gap at the top of the division with a win against West Ham. 

However Mourinho refused to underestimate his opposition, revealing that he will not be deploying defender Kurt Zouma in a deep-lying midfield role like he did against Spurs. 

'[West Ham] have in their hands different ways of playing football, different ways of seeing the game, and with a very good coach like Sam, it's always difficult to play there.'

'I don't play the same team. I don't play the same 11 players, that's for sure. [Zouma] is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear.

'We didn't have Matic and Mikel in a final where it was important to keep the balance of the team. We needed someone to do that job.

'He did very well, but it's not his future at Chelsea to play in that position.'

Midfielder John Obi Mikel is expected to be out for a further month after surgery on his knee.
