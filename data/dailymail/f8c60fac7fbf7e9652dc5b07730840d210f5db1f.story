Leicester full back Paul Konchesky's red card against Aston Villa on Sunday has been rescinded.

The 33-year-old was dismissed by referee Craig Pawson following a clash with Villa defender Alan Hutton in the Foxes' 2-1 defeat at Villa Park.

A Football Association statement read: 'Leicester City's Paul Konchesky, who was dismissed for violent conduct in the game against Aston Villa on December 7, 2014 will not serve a suspension after a claim of wrongful dismissal was upheld following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today.'

The Football Association have revealed Konchesky will not serve a ban following the incident at Villa Park 

Konchesky made a late challenge on Alan Hutton before clashing with the Scottish international 

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson appeared reluctant to appeal against the sending-off when he spoke about it in Sunday's post-match press conference.

'It's difficult to have a decision like that rescinded in all honesty,' he said.

'I think it would lack a bit of class for me to ask for retrospective action against another manager's player.

'When moments pass you by in games officials are there to do a job, to do it as best they can.

'I can understand because of how it looked - it was because he was pushed away and they kept in contact. In the initial contact I don't think Paul was the instigator.

'It's easy to be over critical. I don't want to get into a debate about getting other players sent off.'

However, the club took the decision to contest the three-match ban and it has now been successfully overturned, leaving Konchesky free to play, starting against Manchester City on Saturday.
