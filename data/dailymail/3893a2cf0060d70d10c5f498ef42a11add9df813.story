Dozens of people charged out of a West End nightclub after a man was shot dead in the early hours of Boxing Day.

The 31-year-old was shot several times 
at a private function at the Avalon nightclub in Shaftesbury Avenue, 
Soho, at 3am.

A bloodied shirt was found on the street outside the club on Boxing Day. Revellers - some with blood covering their clothes - fled to nearby Leicester Square after the shooting.

The victim was rushed to hospital but died from multiple gunshot wounds. Scotland Yard detectives arrested a man on suspicion of murder and were last night continuing to question him.

Yesterday broken glass covered the pavement and a bloodstained shirt lay outside the club, which is in the heart of London’s Theatreland. The venue is next door to the Queen’s Theatre – currently showing Les Miserables.

It is also yards from the Apollo Theatre, which last week saw  audience members flee in terror after its ceiling collapsed during a live performance.

One of the revellers said: ‘I was walking nearby when suddenly there was a loud crack of shots which was followed by screaming.

‘People
 came pouring out of the door shouting and totally hysterical. Some had 
blood on their clothes and I guessed they tried to help the man who had 
been shot.

Investigation: Officers search the pavement outside the venue in Soho, Central London

‘Most ran away into Leicester Square through Chinatown.  Others mulled about shouting on their mobile phones saying someone had been shot and killed.’

Another witness, who was outside the nightclub, said: ‘The paramedics were trying to resuscitate the guy on the stretcher outside the club. He was covered in blood and looked naked. I think the guy was dead when they got him into the ambulance, he looked in a bad way. Armed police were standing outside the venue. It is unbelievable this could happen on Christmas night.’

Carla Protain was at the Christmas party, which was broken up early on Boxing Day. Yesterday she wrote on Twitter: ‘I don’t even know how to describe how I feel after last night.

‘It keeps playing on my mind. His family, how do they cope every Christmas from now on?’

She added: ‘I’m worried for my safety, I’d rather just not take the risk with certain raves now. Doesn’t feel worth it.’

Another club-goer posted: ‘Anyone could have got caught up in crossfire. Any one of us. They just had no regard.

‘I was a little teary earlier. So many thoughts of how differently that could have gone.’

And a local DJ who was working at the event tweeted: ‘RIP to the person who lost his life last night in front of me. I don’t know who you are but I wish God has taken you into his hands.

‘A stray bullet could have hit anyone and taken them! I can’t imagine his family right now.’

The Avalon is a nightclub, but also has a bar and a cocktail lounge in its basement. Their website describes the club as ‘a revitalised venue that oozes creativity and class’ which brings ‘a unique and stylish vibe to the heart of the West End’s party scene’.

Yesterday Shaftesbury Avenue and a section of Wardour Street were still closed off as police and forensic officers investigated.

A police spokesman said: ‘Police and London ambulance service attended to find a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.

‘He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. We believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification. Next of kin are aware.’
