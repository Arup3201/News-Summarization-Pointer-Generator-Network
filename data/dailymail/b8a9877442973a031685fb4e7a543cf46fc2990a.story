A Conservative MP was filmed being wrestled to the ground and pinned down – all in the name of research.

Backbencher Steve Baker posted videos online of himself attempting to wrestle a self-defence expert, but twice ended up with his face in the mud.

Mr Baker joked that it ‘seemed like a good idea’ at the time to accept an invitation to attend a self-defence class on his day off.

Conservative MP for Wycombe, Steve Baker, takes on an instructor at Combat Academy

The Tory MP for Wycombe told MailOnline that the experience had been worth it – because it had given him an insight into how teenagers who had gone off the rails could turn their lives around.

He said: ‘The guy in the video, Reece Coker, came to see me and told me that when people need purpose in their lives, training in self-defence can really give them self-esteem, so, I decided to go along.’

Mr Baker said he had learnt how to fend off attacks – including how not to ‘get punched in the face’.

But he said: ‘Self-defence can also help young people channel themselves to give them self-esteem – to use their aggression to do some good.

‘We know that in this country we’ve got all sorts of issues – gang violence for example.

‘I think it’s worth having a look at how something like this can change lives.

‘There are lots of young boys who are not going to go to boy scouts – you can’t just offer them knitting classes.’

Mr Baker’s self-defence training, put on by a firm called Combat Academy, was designed to work ‘in the harsh reality of an actual attack or assault’.

Despite being hauled to the ground within second, Mr Baker is not unaccustomed to military-style training as a former Royal Air Force engineer.

On his website he says he ‘currently focusses’ on ‘skydiving, advanced driving and motorcycling’ for fun outside work.

I have also enjoyed fast catamaran sailing, crewing a tall ship, piloting a light aircraft, SCUBA diving, hill walking, driving a rescue RHIB, skiing and golf. I would like everyone to have these kinds of choices and the means to see them through. Occasionally, I take a worthwhile photograph.

The Combat Academy describe themselves as ‘the UK’s number one self defence training partner’.

Its website says it was ‘created to provide truly effective self defence training and martial arts training for members of the public’ and cater for all levels of fitness and ability.
