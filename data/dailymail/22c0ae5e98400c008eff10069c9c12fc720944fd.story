This June was the wettest since records began, with double the average rain falling during the month, the Met Office said today.

Provisional figures showed the UK received 145.3mm (5.7 inches) during June, beating the previous record of 136.2mm (5.4 inches) seen in June 2007 - and more than double the average for June of 64.9mm (2.5 inches)

It is the second month this year to see record-breaking amounts of rain, after this April became the wettest in the records dating back more than a century to 1910.

June saw long, prolonged rainfall and short but exceptionally heavy 
showers, and ended with freak storms which battered areas of the 
Midlands and the North East.

The exceptional amount of rain caused floods in Wales and parts of England.

Last month was also the one of the dullest Junes on record, with 
just 119.2 hours sunshine, only slightly less miserable than June 1987 
when a record low of 115.4 hours was recorded.

And the UK has experienced the coolest June since 1991, with average temperatures of 12.3C (54F).

'Movements in the track of the jet stream, a narrow band of fast-flowing
westerly winds high in the atmosphere, have contributed to the weather 
we have seen,' a Met Office spokesman said.

The past three months have seen lots of wet weather, with the period 
April to June also the wettest on record for the time of year. Only the 
second half of May saw a spell of prolonged fine weather.

Wales and Northern Ireland had their wettest June on record, England 
experienced the second wettest and even in Scotland - where the far 
north west was remarkably dry - it was the eighth wettest June in the 
records.

Many areas saw extremely high rainfall, with 83 out of 237 observation sites seeing records for rain broken.

The wet weather has affected a number of major events on Britain's summer calendar.

The Henley Royal Regatta, Royal Ascot, the Royal Jubilee and the Isle of Wight Festival have all been dampened by rain.

And
staff at Wimbledon have been kept busy pulling rain covers over outside
courts as showers have affected play on a number of days.

The dreadful weather this month also caused transport headaches for thousands.

A landslide caused by a torrential downpour led to a freight train derailing, blocking the West Highland railway line.

The 24-wagon train came off the tracks between Corrour and Tulloch on the 28th June as a result of a huge influx of rain.

The
final figures for this month's rainfall will not be released until June
2nd by the Met Office, but it is anticipated that rainfall will be 
amongst the highest ever for the month.

186.3mm
of rain fell in the country beating the previous highest amount of 
rainfall for June - 183.1mm - which had been set in 1998.
