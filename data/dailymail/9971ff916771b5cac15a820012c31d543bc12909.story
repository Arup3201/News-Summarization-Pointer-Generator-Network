A British holidaymaker has received £2,000 in compensation – from her own lawyer – after she claimed she tripped over a sleeping flight attendant on a British Airways flight.

Shaunna Baynes, from Dagenham, east London, received the payout from her solicitor as an apology after he missed a deadline to bring court proceedings against the Heathrow-based carrier.

She claimed she fell over a cabin crew member who was sprawled across an aisle in business class during a flight home to London after visiting Elvis Presley’s mansion, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee.

Mrs Baynes told the Barking and Dagenham Post she was in so much pain after the incident in November 2012 that she was forced to use a mobility scooter for six weeks.

The 42-year-old was seated in business class on the transatlantic flight after he husband bought the ticket as a surprise 40th birthday present.

But she said the birthday present was ruined and she doubts she will fly again after tripping over the male flight attendant while walking to the toilet at 2am.

Mrs Baynes told the Post: ‘He was sleeping there. His whole body was lying right across the aisle. I broke my nose, bruised my arm and did my hip in.

‘An old woman came and picked me up. I dread to think [what would have happened] if it had been an elderly person who tripped.’

She suffers from osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and a spinal fracture, and said the fall aggravated those conditions.

Mrs Baynes hired London lawyer Peter Cornish, from Amwells Solicitors, to pursue a claim against British Airways. He said he filed a claim but missed a deadline to initiate court proceedings.

He said he has been a personal injury claim solicitor for 13 years but was unaware that there is a two-year limitation period on claims involving flights as he never deals with such cases.

He told MailOnline Travel he offered £2,000 to Mrs Baynes because it was the amount of compensation they were seeking from BA.

He said: ‘Mrs Baynes, all along, all she ever really wanted was an apology from BA.

‘It was a case we may or may not have won, and because I missed that date I felt obliged to do the right thing by Mrs Baynes.'

A British Airways spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'We are sorry that Ms Baynes hurt herself during one of our flights. We investigated the claims and could find no evidence to support them.'
