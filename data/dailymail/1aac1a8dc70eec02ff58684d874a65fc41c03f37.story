The BBC is to cut more than 400 posts under plans to make millions of pounds of savings over the next two years.

Staff were told details of the cuts at a briefing at the corporation’s central London headquarters, including news of new jobs being created.

Around 190 new posts will be created, with 415 cut, leading to a net reduction of 220 full-time jobs across news and current affairs.

Director of news James Harding gave staff details of the cuts as well as changes such as combining production teams for some BBC programmes.

It is believed there will be around 79 job losses in the newsroom saving £11 million and 53 cuts in news gathering saving £6 million.

Five jobs will go from programmes helping to save £3 million while 105 jobs will go from the World Service.

Office closures will save £1.5 million, while two posts will go from political programmes.

Around £4 million will be invested in 'digital transformation' and £38million in 'original and distinctive' journalism.

Plans were also announced to reduce the TV current affairs budget and a 'reshaped' newsgathering operation, including smaller and more 'agile' reporting teams.

The World Service budget will be increased by £5 million to £250 million by 2016/17.

The BBC said £12million will be invested in digital platforms and £8 million on creating additional specialist editors and correspondents.

In an email to staff, Mr Harding said: 'I recognise that there is a difference between full-time positions and the number of people who fill them: given that we are an organisation where there is a high degree of job sharing and part-time working, I expect that closer to 500 people may be affected by these job closures.

NUJ General Secretary Michelle Stanistreet said the cuts will further undermine the ability of journalists to deliver quality content

'The redundancy process itself will mean pools of people are put at risk. I appreciate that this means an even larger number of people face uncertainty over the coming weeks. I would also stress that all of the changes are subject to consultation in the coming weeks.

'We will, as ever, make strenuous efforts to fill the new posts through redeployment, and we will welcome applications for voluntary redundancy. We cannot guarantee that we will always be able to grant requests but we will try to do so.

'We all share the distress, concern and anxiety that such a sweeping round of cost savings will cause. We are going to see colleagues that we respect leave the BBC. It will have an impact, directly and indirectly, on a great many people inside the organisation.

'We are going to go through a very testing time of uncertainty and change. Its consequences will be felt by audiences too: you cannot take tens of millions of pounds out of a news organisation that delivers so much to so many people every minute of the day and expect those losses to go unseen, unheard and unnoticed.'

The BBC added there will be two posts lost in political programmes among production staff and 22 in programmes for 2015/16, with a further five the following year.

NUJ General Secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: 'These cuts will further undermine the ability of journalists to deliver quality content.

'The way in which the BBC wants to carry out the redundancies is the latest move from a management whose approach to recruitment is to grab a coffee with their pals and find them a berth without so much as an interview, doling out jobs with salaries that are way in excess of the normal rates.'
