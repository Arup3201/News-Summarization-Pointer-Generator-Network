Princess Beatrice left her job at an investment capital firm last summer and has since been travelling the world, often accompanied by her boyfriend Dave Clark.

But now the 25-year-old eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson is back in employment, this time in the world of entertainment, having begun an internship at Sony Pictures Europe.

Based in the company's headquarters in London, the young royal did manage to nip away from her desk this afternoon to grab a quick lunch to go from healthy eatery Whole Foods.

Looking smart in a low-key all-black ensemble - suede 'Francois' flats by Chatelles Paris, opaque winter tights and a quilted puffa jacket over a flared skirt or dress - the royal redhead grabbed lunch in one of the store's recyclable bags and headed off, looking serious as she chatted on her red iPhone, occasionally nibbling her nails while she listened.

Last week MailOnline revealed that Princess Beatrice had entered the 
world of entertainment and has taken up an internship at Sony Pictures
 Television.

Since quitting her investment job last summer she has been a dedicated traveller, and saw in 2014 aboard the 
yacht of billionaire steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal in St Barts with 
boyfriend Dave Clark - followed by a trip to Aspen, America's chicest 
ski resort.

But flame-haired
 Beatrice has now started work experience at Sony Pictures Television at
 its London headquarters, run by President of International Production Andrea Wong.

Lunch al desko? Last week MailOnline revealed that Princess Beatrice had entered the world of entertainment and has taken up an internship at Sony Pictures Television

The company is a division of Sony 
Entertainment, and is the owner and international distributor of shows 
produced by a variety of companies.

Programmes
 such as new NBC hit drama The Blacklist, and ABC comedy The Goldebergs, as 
well as The Dr Oz Show, come under Sony Pictures Television's production 
mantle.

Although Beatrice 
does have an HRH title she does not receive taxpayers' money. And 
although she is not classed as a working member of the Royal Family she 
does undertake royal engagements on behalf of her grandmother the 
Queen from time to time, as she is keen to do her public service.

Last
 year she went to Berlin in Germany with her sister Eugenie, while 
teaming up on Great Campaign, a global initiative to attract visitors, 
business and students to the UK.

Looking serious: The 25-year-old eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson has not worked since last summer when she quit the investment capital firm where she had been working for a year

A source told MailOnline that Beatrice was 'exploring other options' and undertaking work experience placements.

Since
 leaving her job at Cabot Square Capital near Marble Arch, central 
London, quietly last summer, Beatrice has toured the globe.

After
 whooping it up on billionaire steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s yacht in St
 Barts, over the New Year with the likes of Justin Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun, 
Beatrice and her long-time boyfriend Dave, who works for Sir Richard 
Branson's space project, jetted in to Aspen with the Virgin boss's son 
Sam, daughter Holly, and her husband Freddie.

Last
 year, visits included three trips to the South of France, a couple of 
skiing holidays in Verbier, a wedding in South Africa, Venice with her 
mother Sarah, and a family holiday in southern Spain.

And
 next month, she will join her sister Eugenie and parents on their 
annual skiing trip in Verbier, France, to celebrate the Duke's 54th 
birthday.

She was also last 
month spotted in Brooklyn, New York, with her boyfriend and sister at a charity gala at the Duggal Greenhouse.

Princess
 Eugenie, 23, as the Daily Mail revealed, is now living in Manhattan and 
working for auction site Paddle8 in trendy 
Soho, where she has been spotted walking happily alone around the 
neighborhood.

Princess Beatrice of York and Dave Clark saw in 2014 in Saint Barts, French West Indies.
