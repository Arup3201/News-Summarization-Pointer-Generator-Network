Controversial: Former French fist lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has spoken of her views on feminism and a woman's role in society in an interview with Vogue magazine

Former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has said that she believes a woman's place is in the home with her children and her generation of women 'don't need to be feminist'.

The 45-year-old, a self-styled champagne socialist famed for her one-time Bohemian lifestyle, waded into the debate about a woman's role in society in an interview for Vogue magazine, with her views sure to outrage feminists.

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy said: 'There are pioneers who opened the breach.

'I'm not at all an active feminist. On the contrary, I'm a bourgeois. I love family life, I love doing the same thing every day.'

Before marrying former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, the former singer and model admitted that she found monogamy boring.

She had previously been romantically linked with rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton as well as a number of famous politicians and businessmen.

However, she soon turned into a conservative wife who shared her husband's right wing views on everything.

But she admits that the couple disagree when it comes to gay marriage.

She said: 'I'm rather in favour of homosexual marriage and adoption, I've lots of friends - women and men - who are in this situation and I don't see anything unstable or perverse in homo-parental families.'

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy says that her 58-year-old husband is opposed to gay marriage because he 'sees people in groups of thousands rather than as groups of people we know.'

She has one child with Mr Sarkozy, a baby girl called Giulia, and an 11-year-old son, Aurelian, from her relationship with the philosophy professor Raphael Enthoven.

Her life in the limelight has escalated since Mr Sarkozy lost the May presidential election to his Socialist rival, Francois Hollande.

She is currently on billboards all over Paris advertising headphones, is appearing on glossy magazine covers, and has a new album out in February.

All of this coincides with Mr Sarkozy being implicated in a number of fraud scandals, including one in which he is accused of illicitly accepting cash in contravention of electoral rules from Lilian Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest women.

It led to the Paris home Ms Bruni-Sarkozy shares with her husband being raided by police in July, but she refused to be drawn into questions about her husband's legal problems.

'I don't feel like talking about all that, and I won't do any more,' said Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, adding: 'The adventure was fun, but now I want to go back to being an ordinary citizen like everybody else.

'I no longer feel the desire nor the obligation to answer questions about a world that has enriched me humanly, which opened my eyes and mind, but in the end is not mine.'

Mr Sarkozy has denied 'taking a penny' from Mrs Bettencourt, but was last week made an assisted witness in a case which could see him end up in a criminal trial.
