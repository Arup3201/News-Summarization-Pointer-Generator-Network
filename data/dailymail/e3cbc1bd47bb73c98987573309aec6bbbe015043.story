One of the owners of Amy's Baking Company, the Scottsdale, Arizonia restaurant which featured in an infamous episode of reality show ‘Kitchen Nightmares’ earlier this month, is facing deportation.

Salomon 'Samy' Bouzaglo, an Israeli citizen, is being investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials regarding information about his past that he didn't tell them prior to immigrating to the United States.

The restaurant, which Bouzaglo runs with wife Amy, gained instant notoriety after featuring on the TV show where celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay offers his professional advice to struggling businesses.

Controversial couple: Samy and Amy Bouzaglo (pictured), owners of Amy's Baking Company, made headlines after appearing on reality show Kitchen Nightmares in May - and being accused of stealing their servers tips

Amy’s Baking Company is the first restaurant that Ramsay has said he couldn’t help after repeated clashes with the owners.

After the episode aired, the Bouzaglos posted a series of unhinged messages on their Facebook site resulting in further negative publicity for their business.

Earlier this week the restaurant had its grand re-opening, but now Azcentral.com reports that Samy Bouzaglo could have residency status revoked after immigration authorities discovered that he hadn't disclosed important information about his past. 

Azcentral.com alleges that the information relates to documents that show he is banned from France and Germany and has a history of drug and extortion charges.

Scottsdale immigration lawyer David Asser confirmed that the deportation process has been going on for two years and has nothing to do with the couple's appearance on 'Kitchen Nightmares'.

Records indicate Bouzaglo has no criminal convictions or civil judgments in the U.S.

Under pressure: Chef Gordon Ramsay walked off his first ever episode of Kitchen Nightmares after being unable to get through to Samy and Amy Bouzaglo about the problems with their Scottsdale, Arizona bistro. However, they say THEY stopped filming. 

After the episode aired on May 10, online criticism for Amy's Baking Company flowed forth - causing apoplectic reactions from the Bouzaglos.

Filming at the restaurant before Ramsey arrived showed diners waiting more than hour for their meals, with Amy cooking each meal one at a time.

One told the Phoenix New Times: 'You could hear Amy yelling in the kitchen and Samy was running all over the dining room. 

'Other tables were complaining and people were leaving because they were waiting so long for their food. My partner and I had reservations for 6:45. By 9:30, we still hadn't received our pizza.'

And when one customer confronted Samy about the fact he still had not been served he as told to 'go f--- yourself.'

Ramsay, who has made millions in the 
restaurant business and holds 14 Michelin stars, was filming his 82nd episode at Amy's Baking 
Company in Scottsdale, serving up his typical no-nonsense 
advice of the venture's failings to the owners.

Rage: The owners of Amy's Baking Company Bakery Boutique & Bistro respond to their 'haters' on Facebook after the episode of Kitchen Nightmares aired on May 10

Threats: The owners of the restaurant appeared to lash out at criticism via social media

Fury: The post came shortly after the episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares featuring the Scottsdale restaurant aired

However even the fiery British chef 
was left open-mouthed by the chaotic goings-on at the bistro -  which 
included a young waitress being fired for asking a question and Mrs 
Bouzaglo 
threatening to call the police on a customer who tried to leave after 
waiting an extra long time for his pizza.  

When Ramsay tried to give the husband
 and wife team some pointers as to where they were going wrong, he was 
met with open aggression from Samy and complete denial about the quality
 of the food from Amy.

When Ramsay tells diners that the 
owners are keeping their waiting staff's tips, the chef ends up close to
 trading blows with Mr Bouzaglo.

It later comes to light that the couple have fired more than 100 employees - in a year.

During a morning meeting to clear the air, the tense situation once again escalates with Amy threatening to walk out.

Finally, Ramsay wishes the couple good luck with their business but tells him he cannot help them and leaves.

Claims: Days after the abusive messages appeared, the owners claimed that the social media accounts of the restaurant had been hacked

Shortly before the Kitchen Nightmares episode aired, the Bouzaglos wrote on Facebook: 'We do not feel the need to make any excuses for our behavior on tonight’s show.'

They also challenged ex-employees to come forward with evidence that they had stolen their tips as was claimed in the episode.

After
 the show aired, hundreds of negative comments appeared across social 
media sites, slating the owners' attitudes, their treatment of staff and
 the quality of food.

Negative comments appeared on Reddit,
 Yelp and Facebook, calling the restauranteurs 'incredibly immature, 
rude, unprofessional' while another added: 'these people were so 
arrogant that they couldn't see that a Michelin-star chef was trying to 
help them'.

In response, the husband and wife team allegedly 
began posting torrents of abuse directed at commentors on their business's Facebook
 page.

First fail: Gordon Ramsay was forced to walk off the 82nd episode of Kitchen Nightmares after being unable to work with the owners, who have courted controversy ever since the episode aired

A message appeared on Monday on the Amy's Bistro Facebook page: 'TO 
REDDIT. I FORBID YOU FROM SPREADING YOUR HATE ON THAT SITE. THIS IS MY 
FACEBOOK, AND I AM NOT ALLOWING YOU TO USE MY COMPANY ON YOUR HATE 
FILLED PAGE.'

It was quickly followed by: 'This is 
Samy. I am keeping note of all names here. We will be pursuing action 
against you legaly [sic], and against reddit and yelp, for this plot you
 have come together on. you are all just punks.'

Another
 read: 'To all of the Yelpers and Reddits: Bring it on. you are just 
p******. come to arizona. you are weaker than my wife, and weaker than 
me. come to my business. say it to my face. man to man. my wife is a 
jewel in the desert. you are just trash, reddits and yelpers just 
working together to bring us down. pathetic.'

The
 war of words rolled on for several days, before coming to an abrupt 
halt with this message on Tuesday: 'Obviously our Facebook, YELP, 
Twitter and Website have been hacked. We are working with the local 
authorities as well as the FBI computer crimes unit to ensure this does 
not happen again. We did not post those horrible things. Thank You Amy 
& Samy.'
