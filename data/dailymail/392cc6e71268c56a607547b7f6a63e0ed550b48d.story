Rio Ferdinand says his friendship with Ashley Cole ended when he chose to side with John Terry in the race row with his younger brother Anton.

Cole and Ferdinand had been pals since they were children, but that all ended when Cole defended Terry in court and the Chelsea skipper was subsequently cleared of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's match with QPR in October 2011.

Terry was found guilty by the FA 'using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour'.

But for Ferdinand the incident signalled the end of his friendship with Cole.

Writing in his new autobiography, #2Sides, which is being serialised in The Sun, Ferdinand said: 'Our final communication was by text just before the trial at Westminster Magistrates Court.

'I told him he had a choice, "You're my mate and you're John Terry's mate. You know both our families. So go into court and tell the exact truth about what happened, or don't go at all".

'He told me, ''I've got no choice, I've been told I've got to go''. I said, "Well, if you do go just know this: we will never talk again. You know what happened. You saw it".'

Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole and John Terry were all teammates for England for a number of years

Ferdinand was so angry with Cole, that he retweeted a comment on Twitter calling Cole a 'choc-ice' - black on the outside, white on the inside – a comment for which he was he was fined £45,000 by The FA.

The former Manchester United defender expressed his regret at the situation and says it was a 'heat of the moment' action.

Ferdinand says he still feels 'betrayed' by Cole for not telephoning him or Anton to explain his position.

He added in his book: 'I think one day Ashley will realise he should've at least rung me. I would have respected that a lot more.'
