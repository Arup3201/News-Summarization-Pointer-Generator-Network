With two female camels sharing a pen, the last thing you’d expect is for one to give birth.

But Doris, an ‘ungulate’ with two humps, stunned staff at Mainsgill Farm near Richmond, North Yorkshire, by having a calf on Thursday.

Andrew Henshaw, owner of the farm said he believed five-year-old Doris's surprise labour had been triggered by a neighbouring llama giving birth.

Doris was 'stand-offish' after the birth before her mothering instinct kicked in and she bonded with the calf

Doris and her half-sister Delilah had gained a lot of weight since arriving at the attraction last June, but Mr Henshaw had put that down to good husbandry because Doris had not displayed any signs of being pregnant.

Doris had appeared normal when he checked the farm's lambs and llamas on Thursday morning, but minutes later farm worker Bob Shaw ran into the farm shop saying she was giving birth.

Mr Henshaw said: 'We were absolutely gobsmacked. Everyone thinks of lambs and bunnies at Easter, nobody was thinking we would have a baby camel.'

While camels are known for their stubborn and crabbish personalities, Mr Henshaw said Doris had appeared 'stand-offish' after the birth before her mothering instinct kicked in.

While the gestation period for camels can range from 12 to 15 months, camels often choose when they give birth, often opting for times when they are in a herd, so they can deliver at the same time.

Doris's neighbour, a llama called Maisy, another member of the camelid family, had given birth on Tuesday and that was likely to have triggered the camel's labour.

The farm, which also has llamas, alpacas, ostriches and reindeer, has set up a camel-cam on its website to show off its new arrival. It has also begun a competition to find a name for the calf.
