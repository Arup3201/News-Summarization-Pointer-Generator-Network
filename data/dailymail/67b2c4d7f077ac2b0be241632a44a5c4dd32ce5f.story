Aggressive, ill and noisy passengers have been named as train travellers' biggest bug-bears, according to a new survey.

A study of Australian commuters found a whopping 41 per cent of people were infuriated by pushy people while coughing or sneezing ranked just one per cent behind.

And next time you
think your journey home is a good time take to mouth off on the phone, think again.

Aggressive passengers: Train travellers moaned about those who push to get to their seats or barge angrily through the doors

Loud music: A large proportion of people surveyed moaned about people who play music at high volumes

1. Aggressive passengers - 41%2. Ill passengers - 40%3. People on the phone - 38%4. Loud music - 35%5. Not wearing deodorant - 30%6. Noisy phone games: 20%7. Standing too close - 18%8. Using multiple seats - 17%9. Chatty passengers - 6%10. People squeezing past to sit down - 6%11. People who sit in seats facing me: 6%12. Making eye contact: 2%13. Feet/bags on seats: 1%14. People who donâ€™t offer  seat to elderly/pregnant women: 1%15. Overcrowding: 1%

Listening to
loud music and not wearing deodorant rounded off the top five annoyances in the
poll by customer satisfaction specialists Canstar Blue.

Passengers who unnecessarily get
too close to others or those who take up multiple seats while using a computer or reading a newspaper
also rank highly.

Interestingly only one third of those
surveyed moaned about frequent delays and cancellations.

And only a small proportion cited cleanliness as a irritation on their journey.

Passengers who strike up a conversation with a stranger were also provoked anger with nine per cent surveyed.

A few unhappy travellers even said they hated it when people squeezed past them to get to a seat or seating in the seats opposite them.

While just one per cent shamed people who don't offer their seats to elderly or pregnant passengers or overcrowding within the carriages. 

But what's more surprising is what bug-bears didn't feature in the results.

Drunk and
disorderly passengers or those who ate smelly food didn't get get a mention!
