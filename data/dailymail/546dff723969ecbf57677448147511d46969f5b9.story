Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on Manchester United's transfer policy and team building Strachan style. 

STRACHAN TEAM SPIRIT

I remember a few years ago Gordon Strachan speaking about team bonding. He was of the opinion that a round of golf and 10 rounds of Guinness was supposed to be good for team spirit.

He thought that if you were together as a team, trained hard and practiced collectively then on those cold, windy, rainy nights when you travel miles to get to the ground, you'll know you can rely on your team-mates in tough, testing conditions.

When you earn that hard-fought 1-0 away win, get back on the bus for that long journey home, you are exhausted but proud.

Great Scot! Gordon Strachan had his own methods of team building, which can involve golf and Guiness

Top. Barnet lead the Conference

Well, I thought of that advice from Strachan after our first game of the Conference season away to Chester.

Our bus set off from north London at 8am for the three-hour and 42 minute journey. We're having no over-night stops this year at Barnet as all that extra expenditure is going towards paying higher wages.

Our bus driver Ricky has the latest device, called a Traffic Finder. In essence, it appears to mean we find traffic wherever it is. Lo and behold there was a serious traffic accident on the M6. We took a diversion, using the Traffic Finder, across country. 

Ricky said we should be there in half-an-hour. Two hours later, we were stuck on an A road, in single-file traffic, moving at five miles per hour. We finally pulled into Chester's Deva Stadium at 2.27pm. 

We threw all the match kit in the middle 
of the changing room floor, emptied the boots into the shower room and 
turned the shinpad box over. The lads grabbed what they could, we warmed
 up for only 10 minutes before taking to the field for the three o'clock
 kick off.

On the road: Getting caught in traffic led to Barnet beating Chester 5-0 in the Conference Premier

By 30 minutes we were 3-0 up and ended up winning by five.

On the bus journey home, I reflected that in the face of adversity and a six-and-a-half hour bus ride there, the team spirit was Strachan-esque to perform like we did. It's one of the most extraordinary days I've had in football.

KEVIN CAN'T GET ENOUGH

We've had Kevin Blackwell as a guest at training this month. He is an excellent coach and to save him from boredom I got him in with us.

Kevin's 
energy and enthusiasm rubs off on everybody. He's got good knowledge and
 it's been a pleasure having him with all our players. The only problem 
I've got, is getting him off the training pitch. He just loves working, 
developing and improving our players.

Kevin,
 who has been out of work since he was sacked by Bury last year, has got
 a tremendous record and I find it strange that he is not working at a 
very high level.

Coach trip: Kevin Blackwell's only problem at Barnet has been getting him off the training pitch

COOKY IS ON FIRE

A week before the season started I had a phone call from a bloke called Lee Cook asking if he could train with us just to get fit, as he had no club. 

I told him we were no longer having anyone on trial as we were in the key stages of preparing for the season. I wished him luck, and just out of decency I asked Lee who he played for previously. He replied: 'I'm the Lee Cook who got transferred to QPR from Fulham for £2.5million five years ago.' 

Recipe for success: Former QPR star Lee Cook has earned himself a contract after pitching up to to train

I thought we had got to get him in, so I invited him to training the following day. I warned him that we didn't have any money to pay him. We trained him hard – and in the first session he vomited everywhere. 

Lee was playing in the Greek Premier League for Apollon Smyrni since January but he didn't have a club. He can hardly run, but he's always got a smile on his face and has a wicked left foot. Well, he earned himself a one-year deal, has already scored a hat-trick and is our top scorer with six goals.

Cook has certainly got the recipe for success.

ALLEN'S ANALYSIS...

The person I keep hearing about this month... Neil Aspin.

Halifax Town have had a resurgence under former Leeds United defender Aspin. I have been impressed with his managerial methods. I met him recently and he told me he only recruits players from the lower levels who are hungry for football, rather than those who can't get a club elsewhere and are dropping into the Conference. 

Remember the name! Leeds United could do worse than take a chance on Halifax boss Neil Aspin (L)

Halifax beat Barnet 4-0 at the end of last season – and it could have been 10. Afterwards, I met Neil in my office. As he was shutting the door to leave, he stepped back in and asked if I knew where the nearest supermarket or off-licence was. I told him I didn't have a clue and asked why. 

He replied that they had no midweek game and winning away from home called for a case of lager for the lads to share at the back of the bus, rewarding them for their hard work. I loved it. Watch out for him. Leeds are looking for a new manager and he would be ideal.

ONE THING I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT... Fergie Time

Football should follow rugby and have the old time keeper sat up in the stands, separate from everybody. It would help avoid any question or doubt about Fergie Time.

Tick tock! Using an independent timekeeper as they do in rugby would prevent a 'Fergie Time' fiasco

They should have full control of the clock, the time-wasting and the ball being out of play and independently decide on added time. As soon as that time comes to an end, a massive foghorn should be blown around the stadium to end the game, wherever the ball is on the pitch. 

It would create entertainment and talking points. I reckon that would be magic – unless we were a goal down, on the attack and it went off!

THE BIG ISSUE...Why has Louis van Gaal splashed almost £60million on Angel di Maria?

My old youth team manager at QPR George Graham, from whom I learnt so much, always said that you have to build teams from the back. He stood by that.

Building from the back: United chose to spend £60m on Angel di Maria when what they needed was defenders

Manchester United should've spent that huge fee for Di Maria on German centre-back Mats Hummels and Real Madrid's Sami Khedira. Hummels would've been a central figure and a leader and Khedira could've been an enforcer in front of him. 

Real were making noises that they were willing to let him go for £27.5million.

United now have Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Danny Welbeck, Adnan Januzaj – they were not crying out for Di Maria.

Mr Van Gaal was pleading for patience after their Gaal-ing performance against my old club MK Dons in the League Cup.

But that 
was a real chance of silverware for them and he blew it. They've got no 
chance of winning the Premier League, are not in Europe and the only cup
 they could win is the FA Cup. 

Their team needs strengthening – and fast – to have any chance of that.

Oops! Manchester United have no chance of winning any silverware under Louis van Gaal this season
