A driver killed his own step-sister in an illegal drag race after she was thrown off a motorbike she was riding and landed in the path of his car. 

Aaron Bridgeman smashed into his step-sister Vicky, 40, who was riding pillion passenger on a motorbike driven by a friend but was flung into the road after hitting a puddle.

Bridgeman, 35, who does not have a driving licence, could not stop his Peugeot in time and ran his step-sister over before she was hit by another car.

Biker Jason Szalkowski, 32, was thrown from the motorcycle and left 'badly injured' after hitting floodwater on the lane near Caerphilly, south Wales. 

Bridgeman then fled the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance.

Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said: 'Bridgeman had been racing the motorcycle and was literally right behind it the car was unable to stop or get out of the way.

'Bridgeman simply wasn't able to avoid his own step-sister as she went over the front of his car.'

Newport Crown Court heard how Bridgeman briefly stopped his car before fleeing the scene of the accident in December, 2013.

Mr Bennett added: 'He looked briefly at Jason Szalkowski, who he knew well, and at the body of his own step-sister.

'He then got promptly back into his car and drove off.' 

Ms Bridgeman was riding on the back of Jason Szalkowski's (pictured) motorbike when it hit a puddle, flinging her off the bike and into the road

Ms Bridgeman was run over by another car as she lay in the road. The driver thought he had hit a sheep because of her white jumper.

Mr Bennett said it was 'impossible' to say which impact killed Ms Bridgeman - also known as Claire - but that she died as a result of the race. 

Mr Szalkowski could have faced prosecution but it was decided it was 'not in the public interest' because he was so seriously injured.

Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and admitted to driving without a licence and insurance, fleeing the scene of a crime and failing to report an accident.

In interview he told police he had left the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance. 

Jeffery Jones, defending, said: 'He accepts a severe sentence will follow from such a conviction.'

Bridgeman will be sentenced at Newport Crown Court on March 27.
