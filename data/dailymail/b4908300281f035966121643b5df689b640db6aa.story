The Queen was last night heralded as ‘Queen Astute’ for her ‘carefully calculated’ appeal for voters to exercise caution in the Scottish independence referendum.

Pro-Union MPs roundly applauded Her Majesty’s call for voters to think ‘carefully’ about how they vote in Thursday’s referendum – with many interpreting her words as clear support for keeping Scotland in the UK.

Scottish Nationalists denied furiously that her remarks represented a challenge to the No campaign, however – with First Minister Alex Salmond insisting the Queen was ‘absolutely impartial’.

Warning: Her Majesty is said to have told a well-wisher that voters should 'think very carefully about the future'

The 88-year-old monarch made her much-debated remark on Sunday after attending a service at Crathie Kirk near her Scottish home of Balmoral.

Her Majesty took the unusual step of not only stopping to talk to 40 well-wishers but also inviting the Press over, commenting: ‘I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.’

Asked about her remark yesterday, Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘This was not an intervention but nevertheless it was an important Royal aside. She is not Queen mute but she is Queen astute.’

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured, insisted the Queen was ‘absolutely impartial’.

Former Foreign Office minister Henry Bellingham said: ‘Anyone who has been a follower of what the Queen has said over the years should be in no doubt about her views, her incredible support for the Union,’ while left wing Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Queen’s comments were ‘carefully calculated’ to remain neutral.

But Alex Salmond insisted: ‘I think Her Majesty the Queen is absolutely impartial in this referendum.’

Last week, Buckingham Palace said in a statement that any suggestion the Queen would want to influence the referendum result is ‘categorically wrong’.

Downing Street declined to comment.
