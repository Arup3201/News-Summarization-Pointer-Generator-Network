A holiday usually spells frenetic excitement from a family's younger members. 

But a London hotel is now offering a counter balance to over-hyped nippers - with Etiquette Workshops, designed to teach them good old-fashioned  good manners.

The prestigious Jumeirah Carlton Tower in Knightsbridge has joined forces with children's clothing brand Catiouche to give visitors to the capital the chance to instill some etiquette into their offspring.

Lana Berglas, the founder of Catiouche, along with Taryn Jahme - a qualified International Etiquette Trainer with 14 years of experience, will host intimate workshops.

The idea is to encourage children to build positive relationships within their communities, schools, social situations and within the home environment.

They will educate children on key life skills, such as the importance of exercise, nutrition, dining and social etiquette and grooming.

The hotel is famed for its afternoon teas, which take place in the grand setting of the Chinoiserie, pictured here

The workshops will be open to children aged between three and 13 and the ultimate intention is for participants to grow into confident, considerate individuals with the necessary social tools for a successful future.

It's a world away from building sandcastles.

Through interactive games and role-playing, the children will assimilate important social skills concepts and behaviour ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ while having fun with their peers.

The Jumeirah Carlton Tower is renowned for its sophistication - but can that rub off on it's younger guests?

According to Berglas: 'In our technologically-driven society we are rediscovering the lost art of etiquette and, whilst communication has become global, human interaction still has its place and the relevant social proficiency seems to be neglected in schools and, unfortunately, even in the family environment.'

Meanwhile, parents will be welcome to unwind and enjoy a delicious Sunday lunch at The Rib Room Bar & Restaurant whilst their children take part in the workshop.

First class nannies, provided by Perfect Household Staff, will also be on hand to supervise the children whilst Lana and Taryn lead the demonstrations.

Catiouche is well known within elite London society for organising exclusive children's events.

Jahme said: 'The fine etiquette skills we teach will help shape children into positive, outstanding and beautiful young members of society, whilst educating them on other vitally important life skills too.'

Katherine Gordon, Director of Sales and Marketing at Jumeirah Carlton Tower, said: 'We are delighted to partner with Catiouche for this exclusive opportunity.

The 3-6 year old workshop costs £45 per child and the 7-13 year old workshop costs £65 per child. All workshops will take place in the Boardroom, part of The Rib Room Bar & Restaurant, at Jumeirah Carlton Tower. 

The first two etiquette workshops will be held at the hotel on Sunday September 28 and Sunday October 12.
