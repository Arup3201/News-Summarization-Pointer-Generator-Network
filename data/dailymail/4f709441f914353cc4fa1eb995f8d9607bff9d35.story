The Prince of Wales had a Mexican town in a spin yesterday when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined a delighted group of locals for a spot of traditional dancing.

Charles didn't have to be asked twice when the performers asked him to join them during a visit to the picturesque coastal town of Campeche on Mexico's Caribbean coast.

Twirling a handkerchief above his head and copying the men and women around him, a beaming Prince of Wales deftly tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance, known locally as a Sarao Campechano.

Strictly Charles: The Prince of Wales had a Mexican town in a spin when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined locals for a dance

The heir to the throne has stepped on the dance floor in a number of countries he has visited in recent years. Memorable moments include an impromptu ballroom session in New Zealand in 2012 and a spot of sword dancing in Saudi Arabia earlier this year.

Indeed, so polished are the heir to the throne's dancing skills, he has even earned the praise of dancers, including Campeche local, Carlos Javier Zamorano, 20. 

Speaking after the dance concluded, Mr Zamorano said that Prince Charles was not only 'really good' at dancing, he also tried hard to get the steps right - despite not knowing them.

'Even though he doesn't know the steps, his dancing was really good - he tried, that's the most important thing,' explained Mr Zamorano. 'For me I'm surprised he did it. If he had more time to practice he would be be very good.'

 Part of the act: Charles smiles as he gets to grips with the dance, swinging the cloth around his head to the delight of the crowds

In the swing of things: The Prince copied other dancers, among them Carlos Javier Zamorano

Charles' close encounter with Mr Zamorano and his troupe of dancers came as he visited Campeche's main town square, where he was scheduled to tour a number of craft stalls while meeting local dignitaries.

The large crowds waiting to see Charles were being entertained by the dance troupe, who were dressed in traditional costumes, when the royal arrived and joined in the dance.

Delighted, the crowd roared their approval before the Prince gave one final twirl and moved on, looking thrilled but more than a little relieved.

Earlier that day, Charles had visited the Edzna Maya archaeological site and described himself as 'one old ruin in front of another' as he posed for a photo beside it.

Relief: Charles laughed as he performed the movements and looked a little relieved when the dance finally came to an end

A huge city complex, Edzna is famous for its enormous, well-preserved temple which is thought to have been completed circa 400 BC and used for more than a thousand years before being abandoned in 1500. 

The sophisticated complex also boasts a series of surprisingly modern elements, including an expert drainage system and a prehistoric version of a modern rainwater collection scheme. 

During his visit to the site, Charles was shown around by Alfredo Euan Xool, a Mexican of Maya descent, who showed the royal the site's enormous plaza and  the Great Acropolis, which has five storeys and a row of steep steps leading to the top.

'People of high status lived here, maybe two to three thousand, and the rest of society lived in the surrounding area,' explained Mr Xool after the visit. 'We don't know why they abandoned it, there are theories, maybe there was a drought or maybe the harvest failed for some other reason.'

Polished performer: Charles gave his master class in dancing when he visited Campeche's main town square to tour a number of craft stalls and meet local dignitaries

Missing out: Duchess of Cornwall missed out on watching Charles in action after she had to cancel all her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple's Mexican tour because of a sinus problem

High praise: Charles earned the praise of dancer Carlos Javier Zamorano, 20, who joined in to help the Prince along

Silky skills: Teacher Mr Zamorano, 20, said that if the Prince practiced his moves he could be 'very good'

One person who didn't manage to make the trip, however, was the Duchess of Cornwall, who was forced to cancel her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple's Mexican tour because of a sinus problem. 

Clearly unhappy to be without her, Prince Charles offered a brief comment on the health of his, pointing to his ear and saying: 'Sinus, such bad luck'. 

Charles also altered his schedule to take on some of Camilla's engagements, including a visit to a Women's Justice Centre in Campeche, which provides a refuge for women suffering domestic abuse. 

There, he was introduced to a lady named Irma and her three young children Omar, David and Jessica, who together had recently escaped from a violent partner in America.

Plain sailing: The Prince of Wales also enjoyed a boat trip through the Mangrove Biosphere Reserve in Campeche

Don't rock the boat: Charles sported sunglasses and shielded his eyes from the glare as the boat made its way through the mangroves

Speaking through an interpreter, she told the Prince her story, saying: 'I've just arrived, I was suffering domestic violence, everybody here has been supporting me.

'I'm trying to send my children to school which is a problem for me because I fled from home and don't have any identity papers.'

When Charles asked if the centre had helped, she replied: 'Yes. It's been helpful, a lot, when I first escaped I was very afraid, now that's been turned around. As a battered woman I lost everything.'

And the Prince finished her sentence, suggesting: 'But regained your self-esteem?' and she replied 'Yes'.

Joker: During his visit to the Edzna Maya archaeological site, Charles compared himself to the monument as he posed for a picture, joking 'one old ruin in front of another'

Visit: Charles quipped about the weathered state of both himself and the centuries-old Edzna Maya archaeological site as he toured the huge city complex in a jungle clearing

History: Edzna is believed to have been inhabited by the Maya people from around 400BC to the 15th century when some unknown calamity or crucial environmental problem saw it abandoned

He also met Maria, who is also rebuilding her life and her son Angelo Esteban and daughter Cielo de Guadalupe. The woman's son gave the Prince a present meant for the Duchess - a portrait of her made out of coloured card. 

He told the young boy he would make sure she got it, adding: 'She was so sorry not to have been here to see you.'

Before leaving, the Prince posed for a photo with a group of schoolgirls who had danced for him earlier at the centre. They wore traditional colourful costumes and had performed a local piece.

Later today the royal couple will visit the city of Monterrey, the business and industrial centre of northern Mexico. They will see a public park - a former steel foundry which showcases the industrial history of the area.

Camilla will tour the Santa Lucia river walk by boat, while Charles will meet prominent businesses to discuss social corporate responsibility. 

A Clarence House spokeswoman said the Duchess hoped to complete her engagements on the final day of the visit. 

During the day Charles stepped into his wife's shoes to visit a Women's Justice Centre in Campeche, south-west of Mexico City, which provides a refuge for women suffering domestic abuse, and was given a card with a picture of Camilla by a young boy called David
