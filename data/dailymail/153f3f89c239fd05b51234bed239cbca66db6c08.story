A newly-restored classic World War II Spitfire has taken to the British skies for the first time since being found in a scrapyard a decade ago.

The iconic Second World War fighter plane has been restored by a businessman who spent £1m building it back up to its former glory after it was rescued from a South African scrapyard.

Yesterday the gleaming Spitfire took off from the soon-to-close Filton aerodrome outside Bristol for the first time since the 1940s.

Filton has been synonymous with aviation development since before World War One when the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company set up a flying ground there in 1911.

The firm developed the iconic Bristol Fighter and the airfield was used by the Royal Flying Corps during the war.

Between the wars, the firm became Bristol Aeroplane Company and built aero engines, while Hurricane fighters were based at Filton.

During World War Two, BAC expanded massively, producing the Bristol Blenheim and Beaufighter, two medium-range twin-engine bombers.

Spitfires were also based at the grass airfield for a time following heavy bombing of Bristol.

After the war, Bristol continued to develop planes, by now branching out into commercial aviation and extending the concrete runway to cater for larger airliners.

Filton's crowning glory was arguably its role in the development of Concorde, in the 1960s and 1970s, by now under control of the British Aircraft Corporation. Pictured above is the famous supersonic passenger jet visiting the airfield for the last time in 2003.

In 1977 BAE acquired the airfield and it was recently used to produce the Bae 146 small airliner.

The occasion was a poignant one as Filton aerodrome, is to be decommissioned by BAE after more than a century of aviation there, and will close on December 31.

BAE Systems, which said the site was no longer economically viable, is selling the airfield for housing and business development. 

Crowds of aviation and history enthusiasts lined the A38 road which borders the airfield to watch the Spitfire take off, while BAE staff watched from beside the runway.

They were also there to see the last visit to the airfield from the Airbus A380 superjumbo, which was developed at Filton and is the world's largest commercial aircraft.

Exeter businessman Martin Phillips, 51, who owns the Spitfire, said the expensive and painstaking restoration project had been worth it.

He said: 'To see her take to the skies today has been extraordinary, and for it to happen at the same time as an A380's final visit to Filton, has made this a sad but historic day.

'I think it's a terrible shame that this famous old airfield is to close.'

Former Rolls-Royce engineer John 
Hart, who has worked as chief engineer on the Spitfire restoration for 
the last two-and-a-half years, said seeing the Spitfire and the A380 
together on the runway that is also still overlooked by Concorde was 
'quite a sight' for aviation enthusiasts.

He said: 'It's funny to think the last aeroplane to be put together here at Filton has turned out to be a Spitfire.'

Filton
aerodrome, which has one of the longest and widest runways in the 
country, witnessed the first test flights of Concorde and was where 
American soldiers injured in D-Day were taken to before being treated at
Bristol's Frenchay hospital.

The West Country's aviation industry grew up around the airfield, which developed an international reputation.

Race to finish: Engineers worked long hours to finish the Spitfire's restoration in time for it to fly from Filton yesterday

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vulcan bombers were stationed there, and the last Concorde to fly, Concorde 216, is parked there.

There are plans for an aviation museum on the site, hosting both Concorde and the Bristol Aero Collection of British-designed aeroplane memorabilia from the last century.

The final flights from Filton will take off on Friday, before the aerodrome is decommissioned.
