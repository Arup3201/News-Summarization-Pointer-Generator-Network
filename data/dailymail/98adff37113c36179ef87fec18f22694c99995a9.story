Work has begun on the world's tallest wooden apartment block - a 49 metre high building set to eclipse the current record holder in Australia.

The new 14-storey structure, called Treet or The Tree, will be built in Central Bergen, Norway and will stand higher than the current record holder - the 32-metre Forte in Melbourne, Australia.

The building will contain 62 luxury apartments, completed with rooftop terraces, balconies and an indoor car park. The flats range in price from £330,000 to £440,000 and 32 have already been snapped up.

Stretching to 49 metres, it will be the tallest wooden apartment block in the world

The wooden frame will be encased in glass and steel to protect it from Norway's damp climate

Work has begun on the £22million and the expected completion date is in October 2015

Ole Klappe, who is managing the £22million project for housing co-operative Bergen and Omegn Building Society, said: 'It's a pilot project to show that it's 
possible to make tall buildings out of wood in the city. People keep 
saying we have to build higher and increase the density in cities and 
this is part of an answer to how we can do that and still use 
environmentally friendly materials.'

The apartment block is due to be finished in October 2015 and will overlook the coastal city's famous fjords.

The building will contain a number of different woods - although the frame is largely fir - and will be encased in glass and steel to protect it the damp climate.

The apartments cost up to £440,000 and 32 of the 62 available have already been sold

Once completed, the building will overlook the famous fjords in the coastal town of Bergen

The interior - even the communal car park - will also be made almost entirely of wood
