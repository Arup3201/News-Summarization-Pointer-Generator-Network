This is the horrifying moment a woman was sent flying through the air after she was struck by a car at the Abbey Road crossing - the site famously used by the Beatles for the cover of their eleventh studio album.

The video, captured on a webcam installed outside the historic Abbey Road Studios, shows the unnamed female running across the famous street.

The car, believed to be a Volkswagen Gold Golf, then hits the woman on the front driver's wing, causing an audible crunch before throwing her several feet across the road.

As the car drives out of range of the camera - which is owned by the nearby Abbey Road Studios and used to capture visitors' Beatles parodies - concerned pedestrians and cyclists rushed to the stricken woman's aid.

A passer-by wearing a pink shirt is seen repeatedly shouting 'somebody call an ambulance' as he attended to the injured woman.

Despite many thinking the driver of the vehicle fled the scene, according to staff at the recording studio, they pulled over to help.

A spokesperson said: 'Our security team recognised it as an incident which occurred over a year ago.

'The motorist concerned did actually stop at the scene to offer assistance.' 

The incident occurred about 5.58pm on July 3, 2012, a London Ambulance Service spokesperson said.

'We sent an ambulance crew and a responder by car to the scene. We treated the woman for a head injury and she was taken to St Mary's Hospital.'

The footage was uploaded to YouTube four days ago and has now been viewed more than 150,000 times.

One web user wrote: 'First, never run because drivers can't see you fast enough to react, and if you are running there's the chance you won't look both ways - you're focused on the sidewalk on the other side of the road.

'Second, look both ways. Third, it's too bad the driver on the left didn't slow down way more when they saw the girl trying to cross, because that probably made her run faster.

'Fourth/fifth, if you hit someone, don't move your vehicle. Keep it there to block traffic and protect the person laying in the road, and put your hazards on.

'Finally, teach your kids numbers one and two by talking to them, and then get your schools to teach them too.'

The woman remains airborne several metres down the road from where she was first hit

A spokesperson for Scotland Yard said police were not called to the incident.

Abbey Road was the eleventh studio album by the Fab Four, and was recorded in 1969 at the north London EMI Studios in Abbey Road.

The iconic album cover features all four members of the band walking across the zebra crossing - leading to millions of fans visiting the now Grade-II listed road markings to recreate the picture.

Last year, a motorcyclist was caught trying to do a wheelie across the black and white lines, before losing control of his bike and being sent crashing to the tarmac.
