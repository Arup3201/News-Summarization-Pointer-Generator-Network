When author Jane Yeadon recalls her nursing days in the Sixties, she speaks of the 'fun and companionship' she shared with her colleagues and happy days spent bonding with the community as she carried out her daily duties.

It seems a far cry from the experiences of nurses today who often work long and stressful hours.

Jane, now 69 and living with her husband in Forres, trained as a midwife in Belfast before qualifying as a Queen's 
Nurse in Edinburgh, and then worked as a district nurse in the 
Scottish Highlands.

Times have changed: Jane Yeadon says she may well not have chosen to be a nurse if she was starting out on her career today

She told MailOnline she loved her job but if she was starting out on her career today, she's not sure she would have chosen nursing.

'When I was young, there weren't as many careers for women to chose from,' she said. 'I started training to be a nurse when I was 17 but it was very different then to how it is today. Things have radically changed. Now it's much more academic and they have longer working hours, I'm not sure how girls do it today.'

The differences seem most striking - for both patients and staff - when comparing how maternity wards operate today compared to in the Sixties.

Jane explains: 'Today women have a baby and are often discharged within a day or two. Before, they would stay in hospital for six days - ten if they'd had a caesarean. It gave the anxious new mothers the chance to develop their confidence with the support of experts.

'Cleanliness is a basic thing but hospitals seem to have been prettied up with things like carpets today'

'Today the maternity wards are more like factories, there isn't time or staff available to support mothers staying for longer.'

She also believes it's harder for new mothers to find support from their communities today because everyone leads busy lifestyles and many aren't friendly with their neighbours.

Jane wonders if more mothers would choose home births today if there were more midwives available to help them.

In the past, as portrayed in the TV show Call The Midwife, she and her colleagues would cycle to the homes of mothers-to-be to help deliver their babies - with all the equipment they needed in a basket on their bicycles.

She said: 'We used to cycle everywhere and that did make us feel part of the community and gave us a chance to speak to people. Sex education wasn't as good then though, the children I spoke to used to think we were delivering the babies to the new mothers in our baskets!'

Of the BBC show, based on the experiences of midwife Jennifer Worth in the Fifties, Jane said she can 'relate to a lot of it although some scenes have obviously been modified to be more entertaining than reality'.

Home births were commonplace in the Fifties and one in three newborns were delivered in British homes in the Sixties. By the Seventies, the majority were on labour wards after the Peel Report recommended that all births should be carried out in hospitals.

Today the number of women booking to have a home birth is rising but the service is limited by some health authorities and only about 2.5 per cent of pregnant women in the UK choose this option.

Jane said: 'Anyone who has had a home birth will tell you it's great but I expect there's not enough midwives today to provide the service.'

Tellingly, when Jane had her own two children, who are now in their thirties, she chose a hospital birth.

'I suppose it's because of my job I knew all the worst case scenarios so I wanted to have full medical support,' she said.

Sharing her memories: Now retired from her nursing duties, she has penned three memoirs of her experiences. The latest, Call Me Sister, right, is published this week

Jane wrote about her midwifery days in her memoirs 'It Won't Hurt a Bit!' and 'It Shouldn't Happen to a Midwife!'

Her third memoir, 'Call Me Sister', published this month by Black & White Publishing, recalls her time training to be a district nurse in Scotland.

She was faced with all manner of challenges, from 
unwilling patients and life-threatening emergencies, to badly-behaved 
dogs and runaway chickens, all with the 'back-up' of the 
community she served.

'We weren't dressed for comfort. 'The uniforms were constricting so we were always having to hike up them up'

When it comes to the hospital wards, Jane said 'cleanliness was God' in the Sixties and there were less instances of people contracting super bugs like MRSA.

'Cleanliness is a basic thing but hospitals seem to have been prettied up with things like carpets today. It's common sense you can't hose them down.

'I think standards were higher back then. If you were seen spending your time talking to a patient you were frogmarched off to clean instead, it was all very military. However the more experienced you got the less time you were expected to spend cleaning.'

Jane said the nurses were all referred to by their surnames and their level of experience was denoted by the colour of their belt.

She concedes that when it comes to uniform, nurses today have a better deal. In the Sixties they had to wear dresses and stockings with pillbox hats.

'We weren't dressed for comfort,' she said. 'The uniforms were constricting so we were always having to hike up them up so we could move around better - but we were then told off for our rising hemlines. We had to wear starched aprons - a new one every day that had been freshly laundered.'

In the book, she recalls how the hats worn for nursing lacked style credentials and couldn't be worn at a trendy, jaunty angle. She writes: 'They only stayed in one position, were the same colour as our coats and defied any sort of creativity, unless you could do a fancy bow with the ties.'

Call Me Sister by Jane Yeadon, published by Black & White Publishing, is on sale now for Â£9.99.
