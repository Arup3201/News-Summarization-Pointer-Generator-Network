Norway midfielder Martin Odegaard was photographed at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday night watching Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie.

The 16-year-old has toured Europe's elite clubs as he prepares to leave Norwegian club Stromsgodset, and traveled to Spain from south Oslo on Tuesday ahead of talks with Real.

Odegaard is wanted by Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona and both Manchester clubs, but the La Liga leaders appear in pole position to get his signature.

Martin Odegaard  travelled to Spain for advanced talks with Real Madrid on Tuesday and was at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday night for their Copa del Rey match

Odegaard is wanted by Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona and both Manchester clubs 

Odegaard visited Real in November ahead of their Champions League clash against Liverpool, which the Spanish club won 1-0. 

The teenager is football's hottest property and was most recently linked with Dutch club Ajax.

Odegaard is the youngest player in the history of the European Championship after coming on in Norway's win over Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days.

He watched on as Real lost 2-0 against their Madrid neighbours with the second leg to follow on January 15.

But former Liverpool full-back John Arne Riise insists there's too much pressure on his compatriot's shoulders. 

'I feel a bit sorry for the boy,' Riise told Dagbladet. 'With anticipation the pressure rises. 

'There is talk of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal. It makes people expect a lot. But he does seem to have his feet firmly on the ground and it seems like he has a great family around him. 

'Even so, it will be tough for him now. People are wary of him and people will look out for him.'

Odegaard was the youngest player to feature in a Euro qualifier after making his Norway debut vs Bulgaria
