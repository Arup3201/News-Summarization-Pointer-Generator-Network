On his way to Europe? Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell is set to be offered another top job by David Cameron after the pair 'buried the hatchet' following the 'Plebgate' row

David Cameron hosted a Chequers lunch for former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell last Sunday and offered him the chance of taking a top EU post.

They agreed to ‘bury the hatchet’ after claims Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after No 10 bungled an investigation into an allegation that he called a Downing Street policeman  a ‘f****** pleb’, a charge he vehemently denies.

And the Prime Minister told Mr Mitchell he was ready to propose him as a £250,000-a-year European Commissioner.

It would mark a dramatic comeback for the former Minister, who was convinced  he was the victim of a police conspiracy after it emerged a ‘killer email’ accusing him of swearing came from another No 10 policeman who was not present at the incident.

Mr Cameron and wife Samantha had lunch at the PM’s official country residence in Buckinghamshire with Mr Mitchell and his GP wife  Sharon. They were joined by two Tory-supporting friends of Mr Mitchell – the historian Andrew Roberts and Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher’s biographer.

Afterwards, Mr Cameron took Mr Mitchell to The Plough pub in Princes Risborough, where the PM famously left his daughter behind last year.

Mr Cameron told Mr Mitchell he was considering putting  him forward as an EU Commissioner when Baroness Ashton, appointed by Gordon Brown, finishes her term as EU Foreign Affairs envoy next year.

The Prime Minister wants Britain to have an economic post, such as Trade Commissioner, formerly held by Lord Mandelson, or Internal Market Commissioner, to give the UK more financial muscle.

‘The PM believes Andrew is ideal for the job,’ said a well-placed source. ‘He won considerable respect worldwide for his negotiating skills as Secretary of State for International Development, he knows about finance through his banking background, and his record in the Whips Office shows he is not scared to bash heads to get a result.’

Mr Mitchell’s candidacy is also backed by the Foreign Office. ‘Baroness Ashton has been a bit of a disappointment,’ said a diplomat. ‘Andrew could bring considerably more style and commitment.’

It is understood Mr Mitchell told Mr Cameron he would ‘seriously consider’ the suggestion.

Initially, it was thought that Cambridge-educated Mr Mitchell would be offered a new seat at the Cabinet table, possibly his old job as Chief Whip.

But Mr Cameron wants to avoid another reshuffle. Moreover, he believes Mr Mitchell’s ‘steely charm’ would make him a big success in Brussels.

Mr Mitchell believes he will be vindicated by the results of  a police inquiry into ‘Plebgate’.

No 10 was accused of not properly investigating the claims against Mr Mitchell. A report by MPs blamed Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood for failing to check the police log or CCTV and not devoting enough time to the matter.
