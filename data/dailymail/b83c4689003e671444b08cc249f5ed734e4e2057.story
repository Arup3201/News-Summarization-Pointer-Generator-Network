A Russian thief nicknamed ‘The Strangler’ after he suffocated and robbed 20 female victims, has been revealed as a travel agent who claims he stole to pay his staff.

Khamzat Nemtsov, 53, ran a local holiday agency in St Petersburg, and had been known for his friendly approach and was well-liked in the area.

However, his company has been losing business to online rivals, and in order to stay afloat, Nemtsov turned into a prowling stalker, strangling and robbing vulnerable women, Russian police have said.

Attack: Khamzat Nemtsov was caught on CCTV as he attacked a female victim in St Petersburg

Nemtsov would roam the streets of St Petersburg after locking up his travel agency, and pounce on a lonely woman.

He would put his victims in a head lock and suffocated them until they fell unconscious before making off with their valuables.

A police spokesman said: ‘He began to develop his very own unique modus operandi, which was particularly distressing for the victims.

‘He would casually approach them from behind and then put them in a head lock and choke them until they dropped.

‘When they came round they would be dazed, terrified and missing their valuables.’

After police released the video  they were inundated with calls from locals who recognised Nemtsov

But after a string of 20 robberies, Nemtsov was finally caught after chilling CCTV footage revealed his face.

The grainy images show a young woman walking into the front door of her apartment block and Nemtsov quickly stepping in before it shuts behind her.

He then grabs the unsuspecting woman's head and puts her into a vice-like headlock.

After a few moments of desperate struggling the woman finally sinks to her knees semi-unconscious before he grabs her handbag and runs out of the door.

Police released the video and were soon flooded with calls from locals who recognised him as their friendly tourist agent.

Local man Ruslan Butusov, 35, said: ‘I used his agency a couple of times and he was always very friendly and helpful.

‘I don't think anyone had any idea that he was The Strangler that everyone had been talking about.’

A police spokesman said: ‘Once identified it was very easy to track him down and when questioned he confessed saying he had done it because he needed money to clear his debts and pay his staff.’

Nemtsov said: ‘I couldn't face the thought of losing the business I had worked for all my life, and telling my staff I had failed them.’

The spokesman added that when officers raided his flat they found among the discarded handbags and purses two Mosin bolt-action rifles and more than twenty bullets.

The man has been remanded in custody and now faces charges of robbery, ABH, and illegal possession of firearms.
