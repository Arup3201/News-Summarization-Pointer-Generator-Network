Dick Reed is lucky to be alive after a large tree plunged through his bedroom window just centimeters from his head.

The Lansing resident was sleeping with a small dog when the tree, uprooted after a mudslide caused by two days of flash flooding, crashed through his Great River Rd home about 3.20am.

Reed, who has lived in the house for 
seven years with his wife Donna, is struggling to salvage the home 
which continues to slide further off its foundation.

A state of emergency has been declared in four counties in Iowa and Wisconsin due to flash flooding over the weekend.

Strong thunderstorms drenching the state of Iowa have forced the evacuation of several towns and devastated many homes.

Arlen Wonderlick's house, perched above the roadway on a soil ledge, was forced off its foundations when a tree fell against it as the rain saturated the soil on Saturday.

'I heard a bunch of rock and saw some mud coming down the
hillside and that was about midnight, so I told my wife we probably should
leave,' Wonderlick told whotv.com.

On Sunday, Wonderlick and his friends moved furniture and
items out of the leaning home.

'We are going to get all of our stuff out of the house
tonight,' he told wxow.com.

'I think the forecast calls for more rain, and
that house is pretty unstable - it could go on over the bay with more
rain.'

The devastating storms struck overnight Saturday into Sunday morning,
bringing heavy rain to already saturated parts of Allamakee and Winneshiek
counties in Iowa and Grant and Crawford counties in Wisconsin, according to wxow.com.

The heavy rains have stranded a number of people and destroyed the homes of many.
