Prince Charles spoke about the emotional devastation he felt at the murder of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, by the IRA during a speech made in Bogota today.

Speaking to the families of victims of Colombia’s  bloody 50-year civil war, the heir to the throne said he understood the ‘bewildering and soul-destroying anguish’ that so many of them had experienced.

Charles was extremely close to his uncle, who died in a terrorist bombing in August 1979. Indeed he viewed the Queen’s second cousin and former Viceroy of India as a second father and mentor.

Mountbatten, 79, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA, who planted a bomb in his boat in Co Sligo, in the Irish Republic, during a family fishing trip.

One of his twin grandsons, Nicholas Knatchbull, 14, lost his life, along with a local boat boy, 15-year-old Paul Maxwell. Another passenger on the boat, the Dowager Lady Brabourne, 82, died in hospital the day after the attack.

The only person convicted for the murders, Thomas McMahon, an experienced IRA bomb-maker, was released from jail under the Good Friday peace agreement after serving 18 years in jail. A second man was acquitted.

Charles is currently on a four-day tour of Colombia with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and yesterday the couple attended a Peace and Reconciliation Exhibition and Ceremony in the capital Bogota.

For the past half century Colombia has been riven by the longest civil war on the globe.

More than 250,000 people – many innocent civilians - have lost their lives as a result of fighting between left-wing guerrillas including the Farc (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and ELN (National Liberation Army), government groups and right-wing paramilitary forces, set up by wealthy landowners for protection. More than five million people are also believed to have been left displaced.

Serious issue: The couple arrived with President Juan Manuel Santos who in 2012 received the Shalom prize for his pursuit of peace

Tragic: Charles spoke of the Colombian Civil War which began in 1964 and is estimated to have claimed as many as 250,000 lives

A kiss for Camilla: One well-wisher planted a kiss on the Duchess of Cornwall's cheek as she arrived at the Centre

Democracy: The exhibits displayed in the Centre for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation aim to promote peace and democracy 

Upsetting: During their visit, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were given an insight into the plight of people affected by war

Many of these armed factions have financed their actions through kidnapping and drug trafficking. Paramilitaries from both side have also been accused of organising widespread massacre, torture and violent crime.

Accompanied by the country’s President, Juan Manuel Santos and his wife, Maria, Charles and Camilla were shown exhibition marking the plight of the victims of the civil unrest, many of whom have never been found.

They also spoke to the families of some of those victims who had gathered at the Centre for Peace, Memory and Reconciliation.

Addressing his audience, Charles spoke of how ‘deeply touched’ he and his wife were to be invited to honour the victims of civil conflict in Colombia.

The prince continued: ‘It is an immense tragedy that violence has cast such a long shadow across the whole of this remarkable country for the past five decades. Many of you here today will have experienced unimaginable suffering, and our hearts go out to you as you struggle to come to terms with all that has happened to you and your loved ones.

‘I suspect that many of you will probably not know that my own much-loved great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and members of his family including one of my godsons were murdered in Northern Ireland just over thirty years ago. So I feel I do understand something of the bewildering and soul-destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure.’

Discussion: While Prince Charles made a speech, the Duchess met peace campaigners, among them Maria Eugenia Cruz (right)

Exciting stuff: Last night saw the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall entertained by ballet dancer, Fernando Montaño

Privilege: Camilla, who like her husband is a long term fan of ballet, described seeing Mr Montaño perform as a 'privilege'

In recent months the president has managed to launch successful talks with the guerrilla rebels, which have given real hope that a peace deal can be achieved.

Charles referred to the UK’s own peace process in Ireland, saying: ‘It is my earnest hope and prayer that Colombia will soon find a lasting and durable peace.

‘Of course, as we have learnt in the U.K from the Northern Ireland Peace Process, and the Good Friday Agreement, building conditions for peace takes time – and there are pitfalls along the way.

‘Great political and moral leadership is required from all parties to the conflict; and from society at large, which must also strongly feel the need for truth, reconciliation and forgiveness. ‘

He concluded: ‘The dignity of those we have met and listened to today is a truly inspiring tribute to the human spirit.

‘As one who has himself experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence, it is my fervent hope that Colombians might find the strength to continue cultivating a commitment to peace and reconciliation in their own hearts. For this must surely be the key to a lasting solution in Colombia.’

After his speech Charles and his wife continued with their busy programme of engagements, the prince flying to a rainforest to highlight the ecology of Colombia, with Camilla attending round-table discussion on the issue of violence against women.

On Wednesday night the royal couple were guests of honour at a State Dinner thrown by the President, at which they were treated to a surprise performance by Colombia’s great ballet dancer, Fernando Montano, recently appointed a soloist with the Royal Ballet.

Both are huge fans of ballet and Duchess, wearing an elegant pink Bruce Oldfield gown with a sparkling bodice, said she felt ‘hugely privileged’.
