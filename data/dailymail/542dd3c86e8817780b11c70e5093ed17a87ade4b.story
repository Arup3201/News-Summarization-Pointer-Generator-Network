A skydiver has recalled the terrifying moment strong winds blew him into power lines during a jump in Florida on Wednesday morning.

Rafael Ramirez saw sparks coming off his harness as his parachute became tangled in the lines in a residential area of Indian River County.

The 28-year-old from Sebastian had to cut him self free and fall to the ground after being blown dangerouslyÂ off course.

Ramirez, who has more than four years' experience as a skydiver, was making a 13,000ft jump in an area popular for parachuting.

But, after leaping from a plane, Ramirez found he was being blown away from the planned landing point and was struggling to control his direction.

'It really happened quickly. I got a 
little frightened when I saw the sparks,' he told ABC 25.

Residents living along the road where the skydiver came down on power lines rushed outside when they heard a crash, and said they also saw sparks flying.

'I
 just heard a big loud crash. It sounded like someone was 
going through the trees. I came outside and looked and saw the parachute
 hanging from the power lines,' Michelle Farrell said.

Damage: The parachute harness is covered with burn marks after Ramirez came down on a power line

Ramirez escaped the near-death experience with a few minor burns. Parts of his parachute harness that made contact with the power lines was also burned.

Erin Franke, of Skydive Sebastian where Ramirez did his jump, credited the skydiver's training with saving his life.

'He followed the rules and did exactly what he was supposed to, and that's why he ended up being safe,' she said.

Sheriff Deryl Loar said: 'Indian River County is a known for its skydive tourism. Thousands of safe jumps happen here every year. We are glad Mr. Ramirez was able to land safely and that we could help him.'
