A grandmother who won a custom-built $180,000 Grand Theft Auto supercar is selling it - because her SUV is more practical for the grocery run.

Cheri Parker, of Havelock in North Carolina, won the vehicle - based on GTA's most iconic car the Bravado Banshee - after her teenage son bought the game with her credit card in 2012.

Without her knowledge, the 56-year-old had been automatically entered into a competition to win the high performance vehicle and was stunned when it was dropped off outside her home.

Selling up: Cheri Parker, of Havelock in North Carolina, is selling the custom-made supercar that she won - based on GTA's iconic Bravado Banshee

The Bravado Banshee has featured in all of the modern Grand Theft Auto games - the latest edition of which sold more than 32 million copies worldwide.

The game's designers, Rockstar, commissioned Pimp My Ride's West Coast Customs to immortalize the Banshee and modify a Dodge Viper SRT-10 for the competition.

After three years of driving the flashy car,  Ms Parker has decided it's time to sell up - to the dismay of her 19-year-old son Austin.

She said: 'It is not a practical car. I actually have a mini SUV that I prefer driving because this car has no space.

Mixed emotions: Ms Parker's son Austin is devastated to see the car go - but the money paid for it will go towards his college fund

'You can probably get two people and maybe a purse in it - the entire trunk is filled with stereo equipment.

The Bravado Banshee is one of GTA's most popular cars. And here's why: 

Speed: 0-60mph in 4.3 seconds

Top speed: 174 mph 

Ranking: 5th fastest car in the game

Engine: 8.4 liter twin-turbocharged V8

The car also has excellent handling and the best braking of any vehicle on the game - making it perfect to race in.

'It does not fit in our area at all - it's pretty rare to see a car like this.

'I get tickled when people see who is driving it - they'll often speed up to get a good look and are always surprised when they see a 56-year-old woman behind the wheel.'

She admits she was shocked when it first arrived and has enjoyed some of the attention the car gets her.

She added: 'It was very out of the blue I did not believe it for a minute - I thought it was a scam. It's a very fast car - I have never had my foot on the floor.

'It will go so fast so quickly that I've been told you need to keep it in a straight line to keep it on the road - It feels like you're flying.

'But it's fun to drive, everywhere you go it turns heads - people want to look at it and talk to you.'

Enjoyed the attention: Ms Parker admitted the car was 'fun to drive', adding: 'Everywhere you go it turns heads - people want to look at it and talk to you'

But driving a customized car can make parts extremely expensive and the grandmother says many are inaccessible and impossible to replace.

With a heavy heart the family is looking to offload the Banshee to a collector who can afford to take care of it - and they are going to use the money so send Ms Parker's son Austin to college.

'I'll be happy and sad to see it go', added Cheri.

'It is a fun car I enjoy driving it but at the same time it takes up space in our home and it's not practical to drive to the grocery store in it.

'According to West Coast Customs and Rockstar the car is valued at $180,000 dollars but I'd be happy getting $70,000 (£45,000) for it.'

The decision to sell the Banshee has been hard on Ms Parker's 19-year-old son Austin.

The Banshee comes in a number of different colours and can reach speeds of up to 174mph on the game

He said: 'When I first got in the car it I felt like I was dreaming. 

I have been playing Grand Theft Auto for most of my life, It is an amazing game - nothing else has anything on those games.'

But despite his disappointment, he realises the car has got to go.

Austin added: 'It's a really nice car but we need the money for other things, we don't need the car to be happy.

'I would rather go to college than have this car - I'm sad to see it go but I know I had some good times with it.'
