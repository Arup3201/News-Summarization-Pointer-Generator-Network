Weekly jab: New injection could bring relief to millions of type 2 diabetes sufferers in Britain

A weekly diabetes jab has been approved for use on the NHS - replacing the need for twice-a-day injections.

Doctors can start prescribing Bydureon immediately to the 2.5million type 2 diabetes sufferers nationwide.

It could spell the end of sufferers having to inject themselves with exenatide twice a day, the Daily Express reported.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence yesterday provisionally approved the £19-per-week jab for use on the NHS.

Although Primary Care Trusts are able to start issuing the drug immediately, it is not likely to be widely prescribed across the health service until after final guidance is published next February.

Bydureon provides the first treatment for type 2 diabetes which can be administered just once a week.

Cathy Moulton, Diabetes UK clinical 
adviser, told the Daily Express: 'For people currently using exenatide, a
twice-daily injection, the possibility of being able to administer this 
treatment once a week could hugely improve their quality of life.'

Bydureon works in the same way as exenatide but is released much more slowly so the number 
of injections needed is reduced dramatically.

When blood sugar levels are high, the drug induces the pancreas to produce more insulin. This stops so much glucose being produced and released into the bloodstream.

Type 2 diabetes often hits people aged over 40. The number of sufferers is expected to rise significantly in the coming years because of unhealthy diets.

It can be treated through injections along with a healthy diet and exercise.

Bydureon works by recreating a hormone found in the Gila Monster lizard which limits the amount of sugar in the blood.

The reptile, found in Mexico, eats just four meals per year but digests them very slowly.

An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have type 2 diabetes which has not been diagnosed.

Around a quarter of people given the once a week Bydureon injections suffer from nausea as a side effect.

Professor Carole Longson, health technology evaluation centre director at Nice said: 'Type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly more common in adults, so we are pleased to recommend exenatide as a treatment option for some people with the condition.

'These draft recommendations are now available for public consultation, and the manufacturer and other consultees have the opportunity to respond to concerns and comments made by the Appraisal Committee.'
