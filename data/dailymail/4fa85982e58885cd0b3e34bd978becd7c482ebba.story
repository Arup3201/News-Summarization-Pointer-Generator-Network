Proud papa: Former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy and his wife welcomed a baby daughter into the world Tuesday

Former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy and his wife are celebrating a new addition to their family.

Nora Kara Kennedy was born Tuesday at a hospital in Pomona. She weighed 6lbs and 11 ounces and measured 18 1/4 inches long, AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center spokeswoman Jennifer Tornetta said.

Baby Nora was welcomed into the world at 3.11pm Tuesday. Mother Amy Kennedy and the newborn were doing well, Tornetta said.

Patrick Kennedy, 47, is the son of the late Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated 50 years ago Friday.

Mr Kennedy said this has been a bittersweet week for his extended family as they remember his uncle but his daughter's birth has made the time ‘a whole lot sweeter.’

Patrick and Amy Kennedy, a school teacher, were married in July 2011 and live in Absecon, just southeast of Pomona.

They have an 18-month-old son, Owen. Amy Kennedy also has a 5-year-old daughter, Harper, from a previous marriage.

‘Amy and I are thrilled to welcome Nora to our family and are thrilled that both mom and baby are doing very well today. Harper and Owen are so excited to meet their baby sister," the family said in a statement. 

They added, ‘We feel truly blessed.’ 

Patrick Kennedy represented Rhode Island in the U.S. House of Representatives for 16 years. He decided not to seek re-election amid his public struggles with substance abuse, depression and bipolar disorder, Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The scion of the Kennedy clan left Congress in 2011 and since then has worked on several initiatives to improve mental health care.

One of his projects is One Mind for Research, an effort to improve funding for brain science and better coordinate research.

In October, he launched The Kennedy Forum to bring mental health workers and advocates together to improve treatments for mental illnesses, addictions and intellectual disabilities.
