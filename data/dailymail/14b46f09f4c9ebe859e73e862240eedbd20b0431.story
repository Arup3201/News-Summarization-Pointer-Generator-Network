Doctors have not been able to explain why Jameson Davis' arms stopped growing in utero.

The eighteen-month-old was born without hands and only partial arms.

But thanks to a team of engineers and technicians in Portland, Oregon, the adorable toddler has been fitted with state-of-the-art bionic limbs.

The new arms, designed by the team at Advanced Arm Dynamics, are powered by Jameson's own muscles.

When he goes to grab something, the downward movement of his triceps activates the hands to reach and then close.

Rehab coordinators at the center had to develop a way to keep the little guy interested while showing him to use the 'new toys', and so he was taught to operate them by picking up M&Ms.

Lucky: Despite being born without hands, Jameson Davis, 1, was fortunate to get feeling in his nubs. He has taught himself to use what he was given to the best of his ability. But now he has been fitted with bionic arms

Even without fully-grown arms, Jameson Davis does pretty well on his own. His parents moved to Portland to get him the treatment he needs. He has become so use to the arms he does have he can even pick up a penny from the ground

Testing out the new toys: This is the moment Jameson Davis first tries out his bionic arm

Jameson Davis may be the youngest person ever to have been fitted with prosthetic arms. He is eighteen-months-old

Learning fast: Jameson Davis manages to grab the finger of rehab specialist Kerstin Baum, who taught the toddler to use the arms with toys and candy

Rehab specialist Kerstin Baum said the main issue in teaching Jameson was keeping him focused and looking ahead to work out what he'll want to do in the future, such as ride a bike.

'What kinds of things is he interested in - what does he like to play with - that's what we had to work out,' she said.

Engineer Mac Lang, who created the bionic limbs using information from Baum, said it is major development giving such advanced equipment to a child.

'We wanted to make it as functional as possible to give him the best ability to use it and to want to use it,' he said.

Because of their size, the arms will only last Jameson until he is three.

He will have to get new arms every few years until he is a fully grown man.

Taking candy from a bionic boy: Specialists had to teach Jameson Davis to grab for the first time. They did so by using things that he wanted to reach out to, such as M&Ms

These new arms have expandable fittings and will last Jameson until he is about three. He will need to get new arms ever couple of years as he grows, up until he is an adult

A community outreach program has been opened to help the Davis family fund Jameson's expensive arms. They are only partially covered under insurance

'We just wanted to be able to give him the tools that other little kids have,' his mother, Brooke Davis said.

Jameson's father Jim Davis said that, thanks to the advancement of technology, bionic limbs are getting better and better.

'Imagine where prosthetics will be when he's in high school,' he said.

'I mean, imagine the possibilities.

'So why not give him the tools available so that as he grows up, that's what he knows.'

Scientists believe that by the time Jameson is an adult, he won't need to operate the prosthetic s with his muscles.

That is because he will be able to use his brain.

Jameson's parents, Brooke and Jim Davis, moved to Portland so they could give their son the treatment he needs and are happy with the results so far

Doctors still don't know why Jameson's arms stopped growing in the womb. Apart from his impairment he was born a healthy baby

Advanced Arm Dynamics engineer Mac Lang, who created the bionic limbs, explain how they work. Mr Lang said that like any child, Jameson will break an arm, but they will be able to fix it

The Davis', from Spokane, said they couldn't believe the support they had recieved for their son.

A community outreach program was started in Jameson's name to help the family fund his expensive medical bills.

Over $25,0000 has already been raised.

'We couldn't ask for any more for our baby, the love that we felt from the community is awesome,' mom Brooke said.

'A little boy wrote us a letter saying he wanted to give $5 to Jameson out of his piggy bank just so he could help.'
