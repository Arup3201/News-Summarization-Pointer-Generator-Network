Wealthy former President Bill Clinton has his office's monthly satellite TV account, which includes premium movie channels as Cinemax, paid for by taxpayers, it was revealed today.

The DirectTV bill, which totals $184.26 a month, is for his Harlem, New York office and is part of the nearly $1 million Clinton is allotted to cover business-related expenses.

Cinemax, which currently features movies such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, is also called, 'Skinemax' for its roster of late-night sexually explicit flicks.

Also in Clinton's DirectTV bill is DVR service, 145 “Office Choice” channels and 32 high-definition “Entertainment Unlimited” channels such as HBO and Showtime, the Daily Caller said.

Clinton also has a $322.40 annual digital subscription to the New York Times paid for by the government.

The details of Clinton's spending came after a Freedom of Information Act request for documents from Fiscal Year 2011.

All former presidents are given money to spend as they see fit for their work after they leave the White House.

Jimmy Carter was given $517,000, of which he spent $646.57 a year for Dish Network service in his Atlanta, Georgia offices.

His cable package had fewer bells and whistles than Clinton's and he skipped out on Cinemax, the Daily Caller said.

Former president George H.W. Bush received $835,000 and his son, George W. Bush, got $1.3 million in government funding.

Here's how much each ex-president received in taxpayer money in 2011:

Jimmy Carter: $517,000

George H.W. Bush: $835,000

Bill Clinton: $1 million

George W. Bush: $1.3 million

That money does not include Secret Service protection for them or their wife, which is also paid for by the taxpayers.

A breakdown on whether either Bush 
charged a television bill to the taxpayers was not immediately 
available, the Daily Caller said.

The details on the spending of the ex 
presidents has one Republican lawmaker calling for changes in the way 
government doles out money to them.

Hands out: Former presidents Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush also receive government funding to cover their business expenses

Jason Chaffetz, from Utah, wants a new law that would eliminate one dollar towards an ex president for every dollar over $400,000 they earn annually.

Clinton has earned $89 million in the decade-plus he's been out of the White House, while George W. Bush has already earned $15 million in speaking fees, the Daily Caller reported.

A spokesman for the General Services Administration, the agency which dishes out the money to the former presidents, said each man is given a set amount and is not told how to spend the money.

'Each of these offices determines which services they need, and the 
General Services Administration pays allowable expenses and services 
under the law,' the spokesman said.
