Road deaths fell to a record low last year – despite a 14 per cent rise in  motorway fatalities, official figures revealed yesterday.

There were a total of 1,713 deaths in reported road casualties in Britain in 2013 - a two per cent dip on the 2012 figure and the lowest annual total since records began in 1926.

But motoring groups said ministers needed to be vigilant about fatalities on motorways – long classified as the UK’s safest roads -  where deaths rose by 12, from 88 to 100, marking the first increase  in nearly a decade.

They are concerned that a big reduction in visible traffic police and rise in mobile phone use and texting may have contributed to the rise. And they fear the Government’s decision to  turn 100-miles of motorway hard-shoulders into active lanes to reduce congestion may lead to future increases in m-way casualties.

The rising motorway death toll marks the first increase  2005. Transport Department officials  said the 100 motorway deaths were still  42per cent  below the average for 2005 to 2009.

Serious injuries in motorway accidents were up 1per cent last year to 660 - the first increase since 2007 - but again the Government  said this was still 32per cent lower than the 2005-09 average.

The Department for Transport  pointed out that traffic levels on motorways rose 1.5per cent between 2012 and 2013 while  traffic levels on all other roads remained relatively unchanged between the two years.

But AA road safety spokesman Paul Watters: ‘This is concerning, and we need to know why. There has been a huge drop in the number of visible police traffic patrols on our motorways in the past five years. It begs the question whether more drivers are being distracted on their mobile phones or texting because they don’t think there’s a risk of getting caught.’

Overall, the new road casualty figures showed that serious injuries were down by 6 per cent to 21,657 with slight injuries falling by the same percentage rate to 160,300

There were 26 child pedestrian deaths up to the age of 15 –  a rise of  30per cent  on 2012 -  while deaths of pedestrians aged up to 17 rose 35per cent to 35 last year. Six pedal cyclists and 13 child car occupants also died in this age group.

However serious injuries to 0 to 15-year-old pedestrians fell 13per cent to 1,332 last year, while pedal cyclist serious injuries to those aged 0-15 decreased 11per cent to 276.

Overall, the new road casualty figures showed that serious injuries were down by 6 per cent  to 21,657 with slight injuries falling by the same percentage rate to 160,300.

The death toll in 2013 was almost half that in the middle of the last decade when as many as 3,201 were killed in 2005.

Nearly half (46per cent) of the deaths last year were of car occupants while pedestrians accounted for  nearly a quarter (23per cent) of fatalities, motorcyclists  around 1 in 5 (19 per cent) and  pedal cyclists for about 1 in 17 ( 6per cent).

The figures also showed that the number of pedal cyclists killed decreased by 8per cent from 118 in 2012 to 109 in 2013.

A total of 48 children aged 15 or under were killed in reported road traffic accidents in 2013, compared with 61 children in 2012.

The number of children seriously injured fell by 13per cent to 1,932 in 2013, while total child casualties were down 9per cent to the lowest total since detailed records started in 1979.
