Shooting: A four-year-old Texas boy was allegedly shot to death by his six-year-old brother

Harris County deputies told KHOU the incident was an accident - and that the children's mother was outside smoking at the time of the shooting, and their father wasn't there.

There were no injuries for the 2-year-old daughter in the house, the affiliate station reported.

Neighbor Edward Gomez told KHOU 'It's sad. It's sad to see a little boy get shot in the face.'

'How comes they got no guns in the safe, you know?' he also said.

KHOU reported that the children's mother is speaking with deputies.

Neighbor Pat Betancourt told Click2Houston 'I heard the police coming and I came out to see what was going on and I just saw the lady come out with the kids and she was very nervous and I just knew something happened and their hands were wrapped. I don't know why their hands were wrapped.'

Wrapping the hands is a way to save residue from gunpowder and other types of evidence, police told KTRK.
