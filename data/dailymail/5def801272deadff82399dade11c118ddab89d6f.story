Wigan are in talks over a possible £3million move for Terrence Boyd.

The 6ft 2ins USA international was born in Germany and plays for Rapid Vienna.

He scored 20 goals in 38 games for the Austrians last season and Uwe Rosler wants him to spearhead Wigan's Championship promotion challenge.

Boyd was included on Jurgen Klinsmann's 30-man preliminary squad for the World Cup but did not make the final cut.
