Scarred: Annabelle Cooper, 26, suffered a six-inch cut to her forehead in the crash in Fawley, Hampshire

A bride-to-be was forced to abandon her wedding plans after a drink-driver crashed into her car and left her with a six-inch scar on her forehead.

Annabelle Cooper 26, said her confidence has been shattered following the crash which left her 'looking like a Chucky doll'.

The mother, from Fawley, Hampshire, has called off her wedding to childhood sweetheart Michael Clarke, 26, because of the facial wound.

She has suffered depression following the head-on accident with Jennifer Kemish's vehicle but is now trying to rebuild her confidence so she can walk down the aisle.

The wedding was booked for April 6 to mark 10 years after she got together with her boyfriend Michael at school.

However, her plans were shattered following the crash on February 15 this year.

She had been due to get married at Southampton Registry Office with the reception at the nearby Royal British Legion.

Kemish, 30, had drunk three pints of lager at a pub in Fawley before getting behind the wheel of her Ford Mondeo, a court heard.

She lost control of her vehicle and drove on to a grass verge before swerving into the path of a Vauxhall Vectra driven by Mr Clarke.

He was driving Miss Cooper and their three-year-old son Paul home from McDonald's along the A326, near Hardley, at the time of the crash.

Scar: The wound has now healed but Miss Cooper has been left with a scar on her forehead

Miss Cooper had adjusted her seatbelt 
to turn round to tend to Paul, when the impact threw her forward, 
smashing her head on the windscreen.

It knocked her unconscious, left Mr Clarke with whiplash and Paul with severe bruising.

Prosecutor
 Kelly Wickens told Southampton Magistrates' Court Kemish had 107mg of 
alcohol per 100ml of blood, which is just over the legal limit of 80mg.

She was banned from driving for 20 months, given eight penalty points and fined £600 after pleading guilty to driving without due care and attention while under the influence.

Kemish, from Marchwood, Hampshire, was also given a community order, and told to pay £60 into a fund for victims of crime.

Miss Cooper, from Fawley, said the pain and trauma of the accident will haunt her for the rest of her life.

She blinked back tears as she said: 'I'm still so shocked that someone can get into a car and cause this amount of pain to someone.

'The judge thought the sentence was good enough for her and who am I to argue with that. But my wedding plans are shattered and I have got to live with it for the rest of my life.'

Miss Cooper, who has no recollection of the impact but remembers waking up in hospital, said: 'I was really scared.

Devastated: Annabelle Cooper, 26 has had her confidence shattered following the accident

'I didn't know what was going on and I
 couldn't see anything out of my right eye. It was really shocking to 
see my reflection in the bathroom mirror, I looked like a Chucky doll 
and I just cried and cried.

'As
 a girl I care a lot about my appearance. It's so upsetting and unfair 
that we can't fulfill that special date, but after the crash it was the 
last thing on our mind.

'It's been so much for us to go through so we are putting it off for at least a year or two.

'The scar has really hit my confidence, I don't go out and socialise as much - it feels like everybody's looking at me I need to build my confidence up.

'But we will love each other and will get married eventually no matter what.'

Miss Cooper also suffers agonising headaches and abdominal pains and was forced to have her appendix removed. Paul is so traumatised he struggles to sleep at night.

She added: 'I can never forgive her because my son was in the car and we were innocent people. There's no excuse to get in a car drunk, especially when you could get a taxi home. If it was me I would never get in a car again.'

John Paul Jones, defending, said Kemish's partner suffered broken ribs in the accident and had to take three-and-a-half weeks off work to recover.

Kemish admitted one charge of driving without due care and attention while under the influence, on February 15 this year.

As she left court, she said: 'I am sorry for hurting them. I didn't mean for it to happen.'

Magistrate Sue Williams described the crash as 'dreadful' and 'most upsetting'.
