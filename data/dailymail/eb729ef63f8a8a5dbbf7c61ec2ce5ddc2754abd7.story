The Duchess of Cambridge switched university and took a gap year to ensure she attended at the same time as Prince William, a new book claims.

It had previously been thought a coincidence that the pair met at St Andrews.

Kate had a place at Edinburgh University in 2000 but gave it up and took a gap year in Italy, reapplying to St Andrews for 2001 after William’s place became public.

Kate: The Future Queen, by Mail on Sunday Royal Editor Katie Nicholl, also claims Carole Middleton held a secret summit with William to ask whether he planned to propose to her daughter.

The book also tells how William and Kate took a make-or-break holiday to the Seychelles following their split in 2007 and made a pact to marry and have children.

Kate achieved two As and a B in her A Levels – the grades she needed for Edinburgh – and the university was her first choice. William achieved an A in geography, a B in history of art and a C in biology and won a place to study history of art after a year out.

Applications to St Andrews rose by 44 per cent after the news emerged, meaning Kate’s decision was risky as there was no guarantee she would get a place.

Jasper Selwyn, a careers adviser at Kate’s former school, Marlborough College, and house tutor Joan Gall both confirmed her first choice was Edinburgh.

Mr Selwyn said: ‘Kate’s firm choice was Edinburgh and that was confirmed.’

According to her house mistress, Ann Patching, the change of heart came as a surprise. She said:

‘After she left school, Catherine made some different decisions, but why she made those decisions I don’t know.’

In 2007 William and Kate split amid rumours she disapproved of his party lifestyle and his reluctance to propose.

A make-or-break holiday followed and Kate reportedly gave William an ultimatum. According to the book, the pair then made a pact to marry and have children.

However at Christmas 2009 Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, reportedly took William aside to discuss a possible engagement.

A friend said: ‘She put some pressure on William to let the family know where it was all leading.

William reassured her the relationship was very much on track and that there would be an engagement soon. Carole trusted William and put her faith in him.’

The book also claims that Kate and William met for the first time through mutual friends from Marlborough in the summer of 1999 at Highgrove.
