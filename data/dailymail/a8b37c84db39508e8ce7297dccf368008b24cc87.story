British athletes travelling to Russia for the Winter Olympics have been advised not to wear their official team kit with the GB logo on arrival because of fears of terror attacks.

Officials from the British Olympic Association warned the 56 athletes and 64 other members of Team GB to keep a low profile while in the country for the showpiece Games in Sochi, particularly while travelling through the capital city Moscow.

The British team has not received a specific threat of attack in the Black Sea resort but described the advice as a 'common sense approach' which comes just days after UK intelligence warned that more deadly terrorist attacks in Russia are 'very likely' before or during the Winter Olympics.

Under threat: British athletes travelling to Russia for the Winter Olympics have been advised not to wear their official team kit while in public places for fear of terror attacks

In a stark assessment, they say that 
despite the biggest ever security operation surrounding a Winter Games, 
more terror attacks such as the twin bombings that killed 34 people in 
the city of Volgograd last month can be expected, probably on the orders
 of a terror leader dubbed 'Russia's Bin Laden.'

The
 Caucasus militant Islamist group, Imarat Kavkaz (IK) that claimed those
 attacks are identified as the main threat having called on supporters 
to strike against the Sochi Games where nearly 40,000 extra troops have 
been drafted-in on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Islamist
 fighters who have been taking part alongside jihadi groups fighting 
government forces in Syria are also identified as posing a potential 
security threat.

The United 
States has given similar advice to its athletes and officials not to 
wear official kit while travelling or away from the Olympic sites amid 
fears that they and allies like Britain, who have taken part in major 
military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, could be prime targets.

Team GB stressed: 'The safety and well being of the Team GB delegation competing in Sochi remains our number one priority.

A Russian businessmen says he was told 'you will be drowned in blood' after publicly claiming officials working forÂ Vladimir Putin demanded payoffs in exchange for Olympic construction contracts.

Valery Morozov has fled to Britain fearing for his life in the wake of his allegations of corruption surrounding the Sochi Games.

Although he says he has no regrets over coming forward, Morozov says he thinks there will be an attempt on his life after the Olympic Games come to an end in late February.

Speaking to ABC News, Morosov said he made regular cash deliveries of 'tens of millions of rubles' for Sochi construction projects.

Morosov, who is now working with Russian prosecutors, said some of the payments to deputy chief of capital construction Vladimir Leschevsky were recorded on undercover video tape.

He claims to have been told the money would be shared with other officials by Leschevsky, who told him: 'I am to bring it upstairs.'

The revelations come amid multiple accusations of corruption surrounding the Sochi Games.

'While
 we have not received any information or advice suggesting an increase 
in the threat level, we are taking a common sense approach in 
recommending that team members wear less overtly branded Team GB kit 
during their journey to Sochi.'

More
 than 2,000 British winter sports fans are said to have booked to be in 
the Black Sea resort to support the GB team during the event which Mr 
Putin hopes will showcase his Russia.

Scotland
 Yard detectives as well as British intelligence officials have been 
with the British team to advise on security matters and the United 
States, which is among the nations to already have emergency evacuation 
plans in place for its athletes, is also helping with information on 
possible threats.

The fear is that with the eyes of the world on Sochi, there will be terror attacks elsewhere in Russia such as at Volograd.

The
 security assessment points out that in July 2013 the IK's fugitive 
leader, Emir Doku Umarov, called on his followers to do what they can to
 disrupt the Games.

A 
veteran of the wars with Russia in Chechnya, the 49 year-old self-styled 
'Emir of the Caucasus' has survived many attempts to killed him and is 
now said to be directing IK's operations.

The
 Dagestan-based group is said to be linked to Al Qaeda and to have four 
so-called 'black widows', whose husbands have been killed by Russian 
security officials, targeting the Games which run from February 7-23.

The Russian authorities have also been hunting a suspected would-be suicide bomber named as Ruzanna Ibragimova, the 22-year old widow of a militant, who it is feared could already be in Sochi and hiding in a safe house.

Her photograph 
has been widely circulated around Sochi where a 'ring of steel' has been
 imposed at Olympic venues, largely closing them off from public access.

IK
 is also linked to Ansar al-Sunna, raising fears that veteran fighters 
from Iraq and now taking part in Syria may be in Russia planning a 
'spectacular' attack.

Terrorism
 fears around the Olympics flared after an Islamist group from the north
 Caucasus threatened to attack hosts and visitors in an online video.

'If
 you [Vladimir Putin] hold the Olympics you will receive a present from 
us for you and all those tourists who will come over,' the men in the 
video said.

'It will be for 
all the Muslim blood that is shed every day around the world - be it in 
Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, all around the world. This will be our 
revenge.'

The US is 
taking security so seriously, it is posting two of its warships offshore
 in the Black Sea, offering 'unspecified air assets', deploying FBI 
agents and sharing Counter Terrorism intelligence with Russia.

About
 6,000 athletes, coaches and officials from around 90 countries will 
take part in events at Sochi ranging from Alpine skiing to ice hockey 
and snowboarding.
