A market stall owner has been convicted for selling so-called ‘legal highs’ in the first case of its kind in the country.

Hamayan Parwani, 37, was found guilty of selling an intoxicating substance to a person under the age of 18.

Leeds Magistrates’ Court heard how a member of staff at Parwani’s stall in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, sold a synthetic form of cannabis to a 16-year-old boy.

Landmark: Parwani was prosecuted for selling a form of synthetic cannabis, similar to the one pictured, to a 16-year-old boy

Police officers were keeping the business under observation and arrested Parwani as part of an operation by West Yorkshire Police, focusing on premises which had been given earlier warnings about selling to youths.

Stall worker Kebba Kujabi was seen selling the substance to the youngster and admitted the offence when he appeared at court in April.

Kujabi was handed a conditional discharge for the offence.

Parwani, who was present at the time of the sale, pleaded not guilty on the basis that he himself did not sell the item to the boy.

During his trial, the prosecution successfully argued that as Kubjabi’s employer, Parwani was legally responsible in the course of his employment.

Parwani, of Old Farm Cross, West Park, Leeds, was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge.

Danger: Police are warning young people that synthetic substitutes for drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy are still harmful

The pair were charged under Section 1 of the Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985, which was originally brought in to target the selling of solvents.

West Yorkshire Police said they used the legislation to target 'legal highs' and hope other forces may follow suit.

The drug the teenager was sold wasn't classified at the time of the offence but has since been made illegal.

The case comes as part of an ongoing campaign to target the psychoactive substances - which are manufactured as chemical substitutes for illegal drugs  such as cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy - and to raise awareness of the health risks associated with them.

Chief Superintendent Paul Money, Commander of City & Holbeck Division, said: 'This is a landmark conviction which represents a real step forward in our ongoing campaign to target the trade in these substances.

'We remain very concerned that so-called ‘legal highs’ are being sold openly in the city and that this makes some people, particularly the young, feel they can take them without risk.

'Just because they can be bought legally, it doesn’t mean they are safe for people to take.

'Experts tell us that most of these synthetic compounds have no real research or testing behind them and are put together in laboratories abroad with the main aim being to circumvent existing drugs legislation and maximise their profits.

'There have been a number of cases both locally and nationally where these substances have been linked to deaths and people being taken to hospital seriously ill.

'We are determined to do all we can to limit the potential risk they present to people.

'The people who trade in these circumstances operate on the margins of legality'
