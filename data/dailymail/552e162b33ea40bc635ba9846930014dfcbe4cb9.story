Michael van Gerwen was relieved to avoid the biggest upset in World Darts Championship history after coming from a set down to beat Sascha Stein while playing with a toothache.

The world No 1 was in trouble when he dropped the first set, and was fortunate to take the second after Stein missed three darts at double top to force a deciding leg in which he had the throw.

But the German couldn’t maintain his high standard beyond the first two sets and soon began to tail off, allowing Van Gerwen to take control.

The reigning world champion finished with an average of 99.87 and hit eight 180s in sealing a 4-1 victory to set up a last-16 clash with Terry Jenkins.

After his win, Van Gerwen said: ‘I have to go to the dentist at 11 o’clock tomorrow because my tooth broke off while I was on the phone around 1pm.

‘It’s a little bit painful, but it is alright. It is a bit sharp, but I wasn’t sharp tonight.

‘Two years ago I had an infection on my heels, last year I had gout, and now a tooth had broken off so it is a tradition for me. Every year something happens - maybe next year I will break my hand.’

The world champion added: ‘For a qualifier he (Stein) did really well in this tournament, especially in the first two sets against me and put me under pressure.

Van Gerwen said it was a difficult match, especially considering he broke his tooth on Saturday lunchtime

‘It was a really difficult game because everyone expected me to beat him.

‘I was a little bit better than the last game. I’m not playing the next two days and just need to make sure I prepare for the next one against Terry because I lost to him last time.’

Third favourite Gary Anderson, meanwhile, came from 3-1 down to beat Jelle Klaasen in a thrilling final match of the evening.

The Scot averaged 103.02 to see off the Dutchman, who himself averaged 100.72, but admitted he thought he was out when he fell two sets behind.

Klaasen was the youngest ever champion when he won the competition in 2006

He said: ‘The first two sets I played really well and he pinched one. At 3-1 down, I tried speeding up and slowing down because he is a machine when he gets going.

‘At 3-1 down I was gone, but he tired and started to slow down a bit and that suited me. I thought if I could win a set I could make it look good.’

Anderson hit 14 180s in his win over the former BDO world champion, and took out a crucial 126 checkout in the third leg of the final set before closing out the match in the next.

One man who didn’t avoid an upset was No 8 seed Dave Chisnall, who was beaten by Benito van de Pas in the first match of Saturday night’s session.

Chisnall led twice after taking the first and third sets, but he was powerless to stop an incredible comeback from his Dutch opponent and was beaten 4-2.

Having lost the third set, Van de Pas responded with a 127 checkout in the first leg of the fourth as he took the set 3-1.

And the 21-year-old took went on to take the fifth and sixth sets to seal a place in the first round in his first ever appearance at Alexandra Palace.

Van de Pas, who is in his first year on the PDC senior tour, said: ‘I’m over the moon. This is the best win of my career. It is a dream for me that I can play the top players on this stage.

‘I have played like this all year on the floor and I’m glad I can bring my game onto the stage.

‘The PDC has made me so strong this year. I have beaten a lot of top players and that is why I’m so strong on the stage. I have played so well on the floor this year and am not afraid of the stage anymore.’
