Clad in feathers, pearls, gems, flowers and bows, a pint-sized pack of chihuauas has been captured on camera dressed in finest couture.

French photographer Sophie Gamand dresses the dogs in pieces designed by pet couturier Anthony Rubio, before taking their pictures for her new photographic series, Dog Vogue.

Each photograph carefully captures the pooches pulling high-fashion poses and unique facial expressions as well as giving them the chance to show off their stylish new look.

Glamour dog: All of Sophie's chihuahua models wear outfits created by dog couturier, Anthony Rubio

'After discovering the incredible Dog 
High Fashion scene in New York, I wanted to create a series that would 
resemble what you see in human fashion magazines,' Sophie tells MailOnline.

'I organised a casting 
of chihuahuas, because I thought they would be the most expressive for 
this project, with their larger than life attitude. Also, they are so 
tiny and their features are so small, they show the fashion very well (I
 guess the petite size runs within dog fashion as well!).

'I invited 
Anthony Rubio, a famous pet couturier, to design pieces for me. On each 
shoot, he would bring his creations, all very detailed and exquisite, 
and I would go through them, pairing them with each other and with 
matching backgrounds, styling every photo like a stylist would do on a 
Vogue shoot (I assume!).'

'The
 experience was thrilling in itself, to create something new from and 
with someone else's art, and then the photography part was also very 
exciting. I tried and capture the dogs' expressions that would match the
 outfits they were wearing, to create a whimsical gallery of characters.

'My
 entire photography work is about pets and our relationship to them. I 
am fascinated by the human/dog bond in particular, and all the things 
that we subject dogs to, especially in a big city like New York. Dogs 
have become more than animals, they are true life companion and often 
replace spouse and children (it is very true in the world of dog 
fashion). I am interested in challenging this bond, and what it says 
about us as a society.

'Why are humans turning to animals to replace 
relationships they can't form in the human world? Why are dogs accepting
 anything from us? What is this bond made of? Love? Co-dependance? All 
these questions fuel my work.'

Unique: Each photo aims to capture the dogs pulling high fashion poses and unusual facial expressions

Resemblance: Some of the diva dogs look a little like members of the royal family as well as Hollywood starlets

'As for dog fashion, it is quite a fascinating world as well,' adds Sophie.

'I discovered it a few years ago. These people gather in charity events, dress their dogs with custom made outfits that costs hundreds of dollars. Designers compete for best designs, dogs compete for best model, etc. As in child pageant though, even though the focus seems to be on the dog, the show is really all about the 'pawrents' (the owners of the doggies), and there is a lot of drama and fun behind the scene!'

'Models' appearing in the series include Bogie, Kimba, Amazing Grace, Daisy, Angel Song, Peach, Cosmo, Chester, Bleu, Sparky, Chai Latte, Coffee Bean and Diva.

According to Sophie, her pet portraits go beyond capturing the interesting 
features of dogs and reveals that she looks for 'soul, personality [and] 
charisma' in her models.

Writing on her website, she adds: 'Every dog is an individual. In
 my mind, each one harbours a rich inner world of stories and dreams.

'As a
 photographer, I aspire to create a window into that world and let that 
richness emerge.'

Over the 
last three years, Sophie, who also creates reportage photos that go 
behind the scenes at veterinary clinics and rescue homes, has focused 
her projects on pets and their place in 
society.

And she's enjoyed plenty of success. Late last year her series Wet Dogs went viral online, and she
 is now working on her first book.

Elaborate: Outfits are bejeweled, furred and embellished in a process that takes months to complete

Dog lover: Outfits are created with pooches who have 'proms and awards shows to attend' in mind

Help: Sophie also does reportage work and has created photos behind the scenes at dog rescue homes

Doing well: Last year, a project of Sophie's entitled Wet Dogs went viral online

Inspiration: Anthony's creations are strictly couture and inspired by everything from movies to fairy tales
