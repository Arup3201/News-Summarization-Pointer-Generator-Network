To put into perspective how young Jordan Rossiter is, he was just 18 months old when Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, to whom he has been compared, made his first-team debut.

The 17-year-old midfielder is now the second youngest goalscorer for Liverpool following his strike against Middlesbrough and he started playing football at an early age, too, when he was around three or four.

He has been at the club’s academy since he was six and he grew up an Everton fan (not that that should unduly perturb any on the Kop, seeing as Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher and Ian Rush were all boys in blue before starring at Anfield).

The 17-year-old midfielder slots the ball home to become Liverpool's second youngest ever goalscorer

Liverpool's youngest ever goalscorer is Michael Owen, who scored on his Premier League debut against Wimbledon in May 1997 at the age of 17 and 143 days.

Rossiter was 17 and 183 days when he netted against Middlesbrough.

He captained Archbishop Beck Sports College to Echo Cup victory in 2011 and a year later made his debut for Liverpool’s Under 18 side in a 4-3 defeat by West Brom - on his 15th birthday.

But it was his performance in the 4-1 victory over Inter Milan in the NextGen series in 2013 the really caught the eye and prompted Robbie Fowler to tweet that he is ‘potentially the next Stevie G’.

That is high praise indeed and he captained the Under 18s in 2012-13 when he was just 16 before moving on to the Under 21s last season, for whom he played 19 times.

He won Liverpool Academy Player of the Season in May after being named on the first-team bench twice, against Chelsea and Hull. He signed his first professional contract in March and impressed in a brief pre-season appearance at Preston

He has represented England at Under 17 level after captaining the Under 16s in the Victory Shield victory over Scotland in 2012.

Off the field, he enjoys Coldplay, dance music and TV series including Entourage and Prison Break. He has now looking to make his big breakthrough.
