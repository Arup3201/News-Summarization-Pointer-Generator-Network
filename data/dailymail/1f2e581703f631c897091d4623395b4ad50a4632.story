An inexperienced crew of sailors had to be rescued after their skipper set sail into rough seas despite warnings of a Force 10 storm, a court heard.

Five became so seasick after being tossed around in 20ft waves they were unable to man the £105,000 race cruiser, Southampton Crown Court was told.

The helmsman was knocked off his feet 
by a massive wave and bashed his head on the wheel, leaving it 'buckled'
and impossible to steer.

He
suffered a suspected broken jaw, putting him out of 
action and forcing him to join the ill crew below deck.

Rescue operation: A lifeboat comes to the aid of a novice yacht crew who got into difficulties after their captain allegedly ignored their concerns and continued sailing into a Force 10 storm off the Kent coast

Some were left with hypothermia as the vessel, called Liquid Vortex, became stricken in winds of up 55mph off the coast of Dungeness, Kent, the trial was told.

It led to the yacht making a May Day call to the coastguard, indicating an 'imminent emergency'.

Despite the chaos, the skipper believed he had everything 'under control', it was alleged.

Eventually, they were plucked to safety by coastguard helicopter and two RNLI lifeboats.

But attempts to tow the Beneteau First 40.7 yacht to port were hampered when the rope snapped twice and later ripped off its anchor point, the court heard.

'Skipper ignored warnings': Five of the crew were so seasick after being tossed around in 20ft waves they were unable to man the £105,000 pounds race cruiser, called Liquid Vortex, a court heard

A lifeboat man who risked his life leaping onto the stricken vessel to help with the rescue was later commended for his bravery.

The cruiser was skippered by Charles 
Sturrock, 51, and owned by Hot Liquid Sailing, under the sole 
directorship of Jason Manning, 36.

Sturrock, from Little Wenlock, 
Shropshire, denies four charges of failing to discharge his duties 
properly as a ship's master, contrary to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.

It is alleged the 'manner of his acts or omissions caused or were likely to cause loss, destruction, death or injury'.

Manning, from Eastleigh, Hants, denies three charges of failing to discharge a duty, contrary to the same act.

Liquid Vortex was heading downwind from Southampton, Hants, to Ramsgate, Kent, when the fiasco started.

It left the marina two hours late at 2.30pm on January 2 this year, heading east along the south coast on an overnight trip.

'Lives put in danger': The trial heard that the helmsman was knocked off his feet by a massive wave and bashed his head on the wheel, leaving it 'buckled' and impossible to steer

This was despite the weather forecast that morning warning: 'Storm force ten (winds) expected later'.

Force
ten winds hit 63mph and whipped up foam-capped waves of 41ft, with an 
over-hanging crest. On land, such gusts would be strong enough to uproot 
trees.

Furthermore, the vessel was not 
equipped with an illuminated compass for nighttime sailing and had no 
way of measuring its speed, the court heard.

It carried 'storm sails' intended for use in strong winds but the crew failed to use them.

Sturrock was joined on board by his daughter and five adult novices who had paid £225 each for the trip, which was due to last four days and take them to the London Boat Show.

In fact they were rescued just 15 hours after setting sail.

Many of the crew had little more than the most basic sailing qualifications and were trained to sail in 'familiar waters' during the day.

When some of the crew expressed their concerns about sailing at night in bad weather, they were ignored, the court heard.

Prosecutor Mary Gibbons, representing the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said Sturrock and Manning were responsible for a number of safety breaches.

She said: 'The morning the crew assembled, a shipping forecast was issued at 10.30am which said 'southwest, storm Force 10 expected later'.

'That information was available to them before the voyage began and indicated the weather that was expected after 7pm that evening.

'Both Sturrock and Manning would have known there were gale force ten warnings in the period the vessel was going to be at sea had it gone all the way to Ramsgate.

'They should have taken the decision at that point not to embark on the journey.'

The court heard that two hours into the journey another forecast repeated the storm warnings, which were also ignored.

Miss Gibbons said: 'At this time, they were still in the Solent, coming out.

'It
was not quite dark and there were many choices available to the 
skipper. He could have turned back or headed to a port of refuge, which 
he did not do.

'It would 
have been an uncomfortable return to Southampton but they would have had
the shelter of the Isle of Wight. After a three hour straight sail they
could have been safely back at home.

'By
not exercising his judgement, Sturrock put the vessel, those on board 
and third parties - including the rescue teams - at risk of loss, 
destruction or personal injury. And that is what happened.

'He ignored the weather and ports of refuge until he was left with no option but to plough on.'

Miss Gibbons said the crew had 
expressed their own concerns about the weather and the journey prior to 
setting sail but they were ignored.

She said: 'The crew stated at a briefing before they set sail that they had limited experience.

                            Prosecutor Mary Gibbons

'They were told the voyage would be sailing straight through the night unless there was a reason to go into port.

'The crew was surprised at this and expressed their views.

'Furthermore, one inquired about the incoming bad weather and did suggest ports of refuge along the way. These suggestions were not taken up by Sturrock because he was keen to press on.'

The court was played a recording of the vessel's Pan Pan call in which the coastguard was told five of the crew had gone down with sea sickness.

A May Day call about an hour later, at 6.21am, told the coastguard the helmsman had possibly broken his jaw after falling on the wheel.

Their calls prompted a rescue operation, in which the helmsman and several crew were winched to safety and taken to hospital.

Miss Gibbons said: 'The coastguard took the decision to launch the RNLI. However, Sturrock did not feel that a lifeboat was necessary.

'Despite the diminished number of functioning crew, he felt everything was under control.'

Liquid Vortex was towed to Ramsgate harbour.

The trial continues.
