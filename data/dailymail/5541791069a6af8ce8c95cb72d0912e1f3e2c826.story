An early morning farmhouse fire in north-central Pennsylvania has killed three children, ages 2 to 13, authorities have confirmed.

The fire was reported at about 1:20 a.m. Friday outside Danville, about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia, officials said.

'It doesn't get much worse than this,' Chief Butch Kriner of the Southside Fire Company in Riverside said.

The Northumberland County coroner identified the victims as 13-year old Daniel Dissinger, seven-year old Gavin Dissinger and two-year old Arthur Dissinger.

The deaths were ruled accidental, however the cause of the fire is yet to be established.

The children's mother was at work at the time of the fire, Kriner said.

He said a 13-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl managed to escape from the home and were treated for injuries that weren't life-threatening.

Another child was staying at a friend's house overnight, he said.

The home had almost completely collapsed by the time the first crews arrived, officials said.

Some 40 firefighters tried to bring the blaze under control, but the house was reduced to rubble.

'It was all but in the basement by the time we got there, so I could not tell you where it started,' Kriner said.

A state police fire marshal was investigating the cause.

The family had only recently moved in and were settling in to their new home

Firefighters said by the time they arrived the house was 'in the basement'. The cause is being investigated

The owner of the property, Merle Zimmerman, who rented the home to the family, said the mother was a widower who had only recently moved in.

'They just moved in. they were just getting unpacked,' Zimmerman told WNEP.

'Her husband had passed a couple of years ago, so sheâ€™s had it kind of rough. Now this.'

'We watched as they went through the rubble and pulled them out.  Three boys. Itâ€™s hard to see.

'I was thinking of my own kids.'
