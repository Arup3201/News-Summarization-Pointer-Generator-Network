If you've ever wanted to see a referee get slide tackled by a player, the time has come.

Howard Webb, the FA's official representative at the World Cup in Brazil, took his trip early on Monday night after being upended by Tottenham midfielder Lewis Holtby.

No way through: Freund stops Webb from going after Holtby at White Hart Lane

Webb, refereeing Ledley King's testimonial at White Hart Lane, took the ball off Holtby in the final third before passing to another player.

When he received the ball back off his new 'team-mate', Holtby was quickly behind him, producing a cynical sliding tackle to send Webb flying.

The 42-year-old soon got up and pushed Holtby in a joking fashion, despite Steffen Freund attempting to stop him, before the German took a dive to the floor.

Revenge: Webb is constrained by Steffen Freund, but still manages to get at Holtby, all in a joking manner

Former Spurs captain King scored from the spot as his Guest XI won 6-3 against Spurs.

'Tonight is a night I will never forget. It has been an incredibly special night for me.'
