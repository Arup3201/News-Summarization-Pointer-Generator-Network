A kindergarten teacher has been suspended without pay after school officials said she videotaped a child beating other children and did not intervene.

Teacher Rita Baci, 65, also used her foot to push a kindergarten student out of her class and left him unattended, according to the Duval County schools investigative report in northeast Florida. 

The incidents allegedly took place in November.

The Florida Times-Union reported that a school district investigation found that Baci on three occasions used her cellphone video camera to record a boy beating on other students.

The videos revealed one boy being hit 'about his face and body several times', another student being kicked while he tried to take cover under a table and a third being punched, according to Fox. 

The investigator found that Baci had shown the tapes to other students and a vice principal before a meeting with the child's parents.

Officials say Baci violated the district's code of ethics and professional conduct when she failed to make a reasonable effort to protect students from harm.

The 65-year-old teaches a number of subjects and uses the renowned hands-on Montessori method for emotionally disabled students, according to Jacksonville.com.
