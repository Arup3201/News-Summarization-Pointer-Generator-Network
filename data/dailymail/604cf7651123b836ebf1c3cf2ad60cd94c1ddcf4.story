A Whitehall mole has sabotaged hundreds of raids against immigrants working illegally in Britain by leaking sensitive government documents to activists, it was claimed last night.

Small businesses suspected of illicitly employing foreigners were tipped off after a radical protest group was covertly handed the hit-list.

The Home Office launched a two-week crackdown – codenamed Operation Centurion – to target workplaces, including care homes, hotels and restaurants and construction sites that were believed to be employing illegal immigrants.

Crackdown: Illegal workers were targeted

But the Anti Raids Network, a left-wing pressure group, said it had warned the companies to expect officials to bang on the door after being passed the paperwork by the mole, Channel 4 News claimed.

The leak threatens to scupper the crackdown by allowing illegal workers to escape capture. The Anti Raids Network said it was justified because the swoops were ‘racially-profiled and unfair’ – a claim the Home Office said was ‘abhorrent and completely without foundation.’ It said the raids were ‘intelligence-led’.

Activists said they had seen 225 pieces of operational intelligence in what they claimed was the biggest Home Office leak in recent years.

One document seen by Channel 4 News highlighted nationalities in specific industries who are being targeted.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was concerned the document listed 'particular nationalities and races'

One entry described Nigerians working illegally in barber shops and another talked about laundries employing Eritrean nationals, described as ‘not the best nationalities for us, but a new sector nonetheless’.

The documents reportedly said there were phone stalls in Northern Ireland which ‘appear to have foreign nationals working on them, some of which don’t speak fantastic English’, and there were ‘nail bars with a Vietnamese connection’.

Yesterday morning, men waiting to be picked up in Ilford, Essex, for cash-in-hand work on construction sites were arrested as part of the operation – suggesting the sabotage might not have worked.

The Anti Raids Network said the crackdown was ‘a clear attempt to demonise migrant labour and satisfy the right-wing political agenda on immigration and the EU’.

It claimed the operation had been launched in the wake of the electoral gains made by Ukip in last month’s council and European elections – a suggestion vehemently denied by the Home Office, which said it had been planned some time ago.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was concerned the document listed ‘particular nationalities and races’.

Westminster sources said the details were suspected of being leaked by one of the agencies it worked with to crack down on illegal workers.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘I should like to be very clear that the Home Office does not engage in racial profiling and any suggestion to this effect is both abhorrent and completely without foundation.’

He added: ‘Our enforcement activity, conducted in conjunction with other government agencies, is intelligence-led and targets sectors of the economy where illegal working is suspected.

'We do not perform “fishing expeditions” and in the case of the current operation, we have worked carefully with employers who share the public’s concerns about illegal working.’
