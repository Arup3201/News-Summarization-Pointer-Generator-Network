An NHS hospital has applied to serve alcohol to patients in their beds.

Bosses at the Basingstoke hospital insist the wine and beer will only be available for people being treated in a new private wing.

But critics warned against hospitals acting like hotels and sending ‘mixed messages’ on the impact of alcohol on health.

Drink: Patients at the new private wing of Basingstoke hospital will be able to have wine from 10am to 10pm, seven days a week

Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust warns on its website of the dangers of ‘regularly drinking more than is advised by the NHS’.

But it has applied to the local council for an alcohol licence for patients in the private ward of a new diagnostic and treatment centre.

Donna Green, the trust’s chief operating officer insisted patients at the unit would only be served alcohol if it was medically appropriate.

Regular reviews of the policy would be carried out, she added.

‘Patients will be refused alcohol if it is not advisable for them to drink – if they have been given anaesthetic for instance.

‘It is usual practice for private patients to have the option of alcohol with their meals,’ she said.

Visitors to the private ward could also be served alcoholic drinks.

Private: Hampshire Hospitals NHS Trust has applied to serve alcohol to private patients in its new wing

The hospital has applied to serve alcohol on hospital grounds between 10am and 10pm, seven days a week.

But Jack Cousens, a Labour member of the local authority’s community well-being committee, opposed the plan.

‘I would certainly prefer that they did not serve alcohol, and I will be asking that the licence is not allowed, he said.

‘Selling
something which is harmful to health – whether it be alcohol or 
cigarettes – makes the argument a lot more difficult when you’re trying 
to encourage people to cut down. It’s very counter-intuitive.

‘It’s
a hospital, not a hotel. The NHS spends a huge amount of money 
encouraging people to cut down on alcohol, and on treating people with 
alcohol-related illnesses, and we don’t need hospitals sending this kind
of mixed message.’

A Department of Health spokesman insisted hospitals must ensure they did not encourage drinking.

‘Most people can drink alcohol in moderation without damaging their health. It is for hospitals to decide locally if they want to make it available, provided this is not in conflict with a patient’s condition and there is no encouragement to drink to excess,’ he said.
