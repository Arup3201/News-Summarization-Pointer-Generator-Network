After Everton sealed a permanent deal for a club record £28million, lifelong fan Lyndon Lloyd of Toffeeweb looks back on a successful summer... and looks forward to a bright future.

In this era of soaring transfer fees, the £28million deal that Everton negotiated with Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku almost appears modest.

At close to double the fee paid for Marouane Fellaini in 2008,  it represents a quantum leap from the last four transfer windows, during which Everton did not spend a penny on a first-team acquisition.

In shattering the club’s record transfer fee for an incoming player, Everton have delivered a statement of intent to the Premier League.

True Blue: Romelu Lukaku joined Everton on a permanent deal after a successful loan at Goodison

It presents further signs that one of English football’s sleeping giants may finally be awakening from its slumbers.

And this in the same week as its brightest hope, Ross Barkley, followed Martinez, Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines in putting pen to paper on a long-term contract extension.

But how much is left in the Goodison Park coffers to bring in further reinforcements remains to be seen.

The Toffees’ capture of Lukaku and Gareth Barry, another of last season’s impressive temporary signings, illustrates the power of the much-maligned loan market and the effective way in which Martinez has used it.

The leader of the pack: Signing Gareth Barry (centre) was a blinding bit of business by Roberto Martinez

Together with the £4m paid for midfielder Muhamed Besic, Everton have committed £34m this summer just to bring senior squad numbers back to where they were when the 2013-14 campaign finished in May.

But they are yet to replace the mercurial talents of another loanee, Gerard Deulofeu.

By his own admission, Martinez needs at least 27 players at his disposal in order to cope with the extra demands that will be placed on his squad by Everton’s involvement in Europe.

He hit his target of signing a genuine No 9 in the form of Lukaku, and nailed down his options in the vital defensive midfield anchor role that is central to his team’s attacking style.

The Spaniard has the core of his first-choice side settled before the season has kicked off, instead of having to wait until the last minute in the transfer window to acquire key components.

Importantly, he now has the leeway to round out his squad with a mix of affordable permanent signings and targeted loan acquisitions that will add more talent in forward areas - without putting excessive strain on the bank balance.

It is a necessarily prudent transfer strategy, one that hasn’t always been popular among supporters but which has helped Everton avoid the boom-and-bust approach that has been so damaging to the likes of Blackburn Rovers, Portsmouth and QPR in recent years. 

If, in combination with Martinez’s enterprising management, it results in a long-awaited top-four finish and vaulting the club back to its former place among England’s elite, it would be rich reward for years of patience and frustration at looking through what once seemed like an impenetrable glass ceiling.

Making his point: Martinez enjoyed a glorious first season at Goodison, just missing out on a top-four finish
