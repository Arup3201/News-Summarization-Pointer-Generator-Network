A New York Giants player has been robbed of $500,000 of jewellery - and the chief suspect is a woman he invited to his hotel room but did not catch her name.

Shaun Rogers had been partying with the woman at the exclusive Liv club at the Fountainebleau Hotel in Miami on Sunday evening before inviting her up to his room.

The defensive tackle, who signed a $1million contract with the Giants last month, reportedly fell asleep at around 7am when it is believed the stranger then made off with the stash.

A night to remember: NY Giants player Shaun Rogers had $500,000 jewellery stolen by an unknown woman he invited back to his hotel room in Miami

When Rogers awoke at 12.30pm on Monday, the woman was nowhere to be seen and he was unable to open the door to his safe. When hotel staff finally forced it open, the safe was empty.

The player reported diamond earrings worth $100,000, two watches valued at $160,000, a $50,000 gold necklace, $60,000 gold bracelets and a Diamond cuban link chain worth $70,000 missing.

A Miami police report stated that 34-year-old Rogers, who is not married, left the hotel at around 1am to go to the nightclub with a male and female friend.

He then returned to the hotel room with his friends plus the unknown woman where the group continued to party but Rogers went to sleep.

Although the football player could not remember his date's name, his friend did have the cellphone number of another woman who had been partying with their group at the club.

The suspect is still unknown at this time although police were investigating.

The Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment at the time of publication.
