A surveillance video reveals the shocking moment a special needs teacher grabbed an autistic child by his hair before throwing him to the ground.

The Florida teacher, David Baier,  lost his job at the school where the alleged abuse took place, and faces four counts of child cruelty.

'I wanted what was best for my son, and I trusted these people,'  the 12-year-old boy's mother, known only as Wendy, said.

Forceful: When the autistic boy refuses to stand, Baier is seen throwing him to the ground

The incident happened at a summer camp field trip organized by Davie Preparatory School, for children with emotional and behavioral problems, on July 27 last year.

Prosecutors claim Baier was captured 
forcibly throwing the autistic student to the floor, before pulling him by his hair and forcing him to stand.

'I was going to
say if you do that again I'm going to slam you,' Baier can be heard saying 
on the security footage, shown by 7News.

The child was being disciplined after reportedly earlier stomping on Baier's foot. He had been ordered to stand, but had crouched down by the chair.

The student can be heard crying: 'No, no, no,' as Baier walks over to him in a classroom, and grabs him by the hair.

'Now stand up and stay standing or I'm going to have to do something worse,' the teacher can be heard telling the child, whose identity has been protected.

As the child whimpers and rubs his head, Baier can be heard telling him: 'I didn't think it was going to feel good.'

When he asked the student why he had misbehaved earlier, the boy accused Baier of being pushy.

Moments later Baier grabbed the autistic student by his neck and threw him to the ground.

His mother, Wendy, was distressed by the 'thought of somebody doing this to my son and hurting him and putting him through that and not caring,' she told CBS Miami.

Although the child was not physically hurt, Wendy decided to press charges after her son returned from school and told her:  'Mommy, he pulled my hair, and he threw me and it hurt.'

Captain Dale Engle, of Davie Police Department, said more than a dozen complaints about the school had been received from parents since Baier's arrest.

'I understand that some of these 
teachers are forced to use some type of physical force to restrain these
children,'  Captain Engle said.

Assault claim: The incident was recorded at a summer camp trip at the Alternative Education Foundation

'But based on what I saw on the video, it was 
well in excess of what any acceptable force would be,' he told the Sun 
Sentinel in April.

After the family reported the alleged abuse, Baier was fired from the Alternative Education Foundation Preparatory School. He was bonded out of jail in August last year and is currently awaiting trial.

Neither Baier or his attorney were available for comment.
