Tired: Marc Dubois told his co-pilots he had only had one hour's sleep before their plane crashed

The captain of an Air France plane which crashed into the sea with the loss of all 228 people on board had just one hour’s sleep before setting off, it emerged today.

In a damning report which will worry long-haul flyers, it appeared that his co-pilots were also dangerously tired.

Five Britons and two Americans were among the dead when AF447 fell out of the sky as it travelled from Rio de Janiero in Brazil to Paris in June 2009.

As the Airbus A330 rolled from side to side in a tropical thunderstorm, 32-year-old Pierre-Cedric Bonin and David Robert, 37, were unable to bring it under control.

Even when Marc Dubois, the 58-year-old captain, returned from a rest break, his deputies were panicking too much to tell him what the problem was.

A detailed analysis of two black box flight recorders has established that airspeed sensors had malfunctioned - probably because they had frozen up.

But now a recording of Dubois has emerged in which he says: ‘I didn’t sleep enough last night. One hour – it’s not enough.’

Le Point, the French news magazine which has obtained a previously undisclosed judicial report into the tragedy, says that Dubois was already ‘grumbling’ less than an hour and a half into the flight.

Tragedy: The plane plunged into the sea during a thunderstorm killing all 228 people on board

The pilots had spent the night before in Rio with their wives and girlfriends, but did not appear alert enough to deal with a high-altitude stall.

They ignored normal procedures and raised, rather than lowered, the plane's nose when it lost lift - or 'stalled'.

An aerodynamic stall is has nothing to do with the engines, which investigators said had operated and responded throughout.

The result was a three-and-a-half minute plunge before hitting the ocean.

All those on board - who came from 32 nations, including five from Britain, three from Ireland, and two from America - died after the plane hit the sea at a speed of 180ft a second.

The French aviation safety authority has already released a report which agrees with a 365-page judicial inquiry that the 'captain had failed in his duties' and 'prevented the co-pilot from reacting appropriately'.

French judges have launched a criminal inquiry into Air France and Airbus for alleged manslaughter.

Co-pilots Bonin and Robert had racked 2,900 and 6,500 flying hours respectively, compared to Dubois's 11,000. Despite this, Dubois took more than a minute to respond to calls for help.

Those on board included Bonin's 38-year-old wife, Isabelle, who was travelling without their two boys, aged eight and four.

A judge has already ordered Air France to pay around £120,000 in compensation to the families of each victim, but this provisional figure is likely to rise substantially.

Air France has reviewed and improved its training procedures since the crash.
