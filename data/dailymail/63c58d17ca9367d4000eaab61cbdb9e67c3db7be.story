Mongolian fisherman braved -22C temperatures to catch the fish first of the winter season yesterday.

Through holes cut in the ice of the frozen Chagan Lake in Jilin Province, northeast China, members of the Chinese Mongolian ethnic group used a centuries-old technique to catch carp and other edible fish in their nets.

The first catch of winter is considered auspicious and this year fetched about 288,888 Chinese Yuan (£28,900) as part of the annual Ice and Snow Fishing and Hunting Cultural Tourism Festival.

Each year, record-breaking hauls are caught by fisherman, rugged up in fur hats and sheepskin coats, using nets. Crowds of up to 20,000 people watch each year in the belief that the catch brings good luck.

Some 936 tonnes of fish were caught at last year’s event at Chagan Lake, the seventh largest freshwater lake in China and home to some 70 species of fish.

The winter fishing technique at the lake is the most primitive Mongolian fishing method and dates as far back as 10,000 years ago when the Chagan Naoer people were hunting there.

The practice, now considered a national cultural celebration, brings together various ethnic groups.

During the festival, which began this month, people dress in traditional costume, perform folk dances and auction off the biggest fish.
