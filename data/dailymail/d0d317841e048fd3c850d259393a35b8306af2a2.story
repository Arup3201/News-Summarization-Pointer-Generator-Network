CCTV footage has revealed that the wrong-way driver who slammed into a car killing three sorority sisters had been spotted by police less than a minute before and was being chased - but it was too late.

State Highway Patrol in Ohio released the dashboard camera video yesterday that showed police  on the driver's tail just moments before the horrific collision that  killed the motorist and three  Bowling Green University students on Interstate 75, south of Toledo.

On the CCTV footage from last Friday, the trooper's car 
can be seen travelling along the four-lane highway when it has to swerve
into the other lane to avoid a driver going in the wrong direction.

Too late: Seconds after Ohio Highway Patrol spotted a car travelling the wrong way, there was a head-on collision which killed the driver and three sorority sisters

On the lookout: Troopers had reports of a driver going the wrong way down the highway, who they spotted (left of the picture) and immediately made a U-turn to tail

The trooper
immediately slowed down and pulled a U-turn, tailing the dangerous 
driver. Tragically, the officer only travels for around ten seconds but was 
unable to catch up with the car which is then seen lying in the middle 
of the road having been involved in a crash.

He's heard saying: 'Bowling Green, give me a squad.'

The five Alpha Xi Delta members travelling in 
the car were part of a convoy of vehicles with 11 other sisters headed to
Detroit airport for a trip to the Dominican Republic.

The first of two cars, each carrying five sorority sisters, swerved to miss the car on the interstate.

Just minutes after the crash, the video recorded the voice of an unidentified Alpha Xi Delta member who came running to help.

The girl said: 'Sir, what can we do to help? They were with us. Those are our sisters. We were all on spring break.'

The trooper replied: 'I want you to go, just go stay by the car. Stay with the car, please. Go stay up there with the car.'

On the scene: Emergency crews work to free the five young women who were in the car at the time of the horrific crash in Ohio. Three died and two were seriously injured

Tragedy: Three sisters were killed in this car after it crashed head-on into another car driving the wrong way

Having realised the severity of the crash, the officers took the girls from the other car which avoided the crash away from the scene.

Spokeswoman Lt Anne Ralston from highway patrol said the trooper was limited by the short amount of time between a call about the wrong-way driver and the crash.

'It didn't really afford us the opportunity to use any other tactics,' she said. 'It really limited what he was able to do.'

She added: 'These types of calls of one-way drivers, especially on the interstate, are very dangerous, obviously, and very unpredictable and there's really no set rules on how to handle that, just because every incident is so different.'

All dead: Christina Goyett, Sarah Hammond and Rebekah Blakkolb (left-to-right) seen in their school photos

Sarah Hammond, 21, a junior from Yellow Springs, Rebekah Blakkolb, 20, a junior from Aurora and sophomore Christina Goyett, 19, from Bay City, Michigan all died in the crash.

The wrong-way driver, 69-year-old Winifred Lein, of Perrysburg, was traveling alone and was pronounced dead at the scene. It was believed that she was on her way home from work.

The injured were freshman Angelica
Mormile, 19, from Garfield Heights, Ohio; and Kayla Somoles, 19, a 
sophomore from Cleveland, Ohio. There were 16 sorority sisters on their way to a 
Dominican Republic resort.

‘I
don't think the college girls ever saw it coming,’ Wood County Sheriff 
Mark Wasylyshyn said. ‘Nothing they could have done to avoid the crash.

‘They were just driving 
northbound and a woman driving in the opposite direction in the wrong 
way on the roadway hit them head-on.’

Christina was driving the vehicle and
Angelica was in the front passenger seat. Kayla was in the right rear 
seat, Rebekah was in the rear middle and Sarah was in the rear left.

Rebekah
was taken to hospital and later died, but Christina and Sarah 
died at the scene - along with Ms Lein.

Christina and Angelica were 
wearing seatbelts, but Rebekah and Kayla were not. Ms Lein was wearing a seatbelt but it's unknown if Sarah had one on, reported the BG News.

Four drivers called 911 
after 2:10am to report a car going south in the northbound lanes of the 
road.

Christina's family friend Dee Bishop 
said she had left with friends planning to be at Detroit airport by 2am 
on Friday in preparation for a 5.30am flight.

Wreckage: The students were driving a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, and three of them were killed by the crash

Destroyed: Ms Lein, 69, was in a 1999 Plymouth Breeze which burst into flames following the crash
