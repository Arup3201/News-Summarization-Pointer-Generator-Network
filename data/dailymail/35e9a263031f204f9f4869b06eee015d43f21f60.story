Lord Andrew Feldman has said it is completely untrue that he made the remarks describing grassroots party activists as 'swivel-eyed loons'

David Cameron has given his backing to Tory co-chairman Lord Feldman after he denied being responsible for alleged comments describing grassroots party activists as 'swivel-eyed loons'.

Lord Feldman said it was 'completely untrue' that he made the remarks, which several newspapers reported as being made by an unnamed member of Mr Cameron's inner circle.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister supports Lord Feldman's position.'

The spokesman added: 'It is categorically untrue that anyone in Downing Street made the comments about the Conservative Party Associations and activists reported in the Times and the Telegraph.'

Reports claimed a senior ally of Mr Cameron made the comments accusing MPs of being forced to take hardline views on issues such as Europe because of pressure from their local associations.

The senior figure reportedly said: 'There's really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the associations tell them to, and the associations are all mad swivel-eyed loons.'

The comments were allegedly made at a private dinner by a figure with 'strong social connections' to the Prime Minister, The Times and Daily Telegraph reported.

In a statement Lord Feldman, a friend of Mr Cameron's from Oxford University, said: 'There is speculation on the internet and on Twitter that the senior Conservative Party figure claimed to have made derogatory comments by the Times and the Telegraph is me.

'This is completely untrue. I would like to make it quite clear that I did not nor have ever described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my view of our activists.

'On the contrary in the last eight years of working for the party, I have found them to be hard working, committed and reasonable people. They are without question the backbone of the party.

'I am taking legal advice.'

The dinner party remarks came after 
some 114 Tories, plus two Conservative tellers, expressed 'regret' that 
the Government's legislative programme did not contain a bill paving the
way for the in/out referendum on EU membership before 2017 promised by 
Mr Cameron.

Tory Peter Bone, one of the sponsors 
of the amendment to the Queen's Speech, said: 'Clearly anyone who takes 
these views could not possibly want to remain a member of the 
Conservative Party, even less still want to advise the Prime Minister.'

He said if the reports were true the 
person responsible, who has not been identified, would 'remove 
themselves' from their position.

Tory MP Tracey Crouch wrote on 
Twitter: 'I wonder if this 'aide' has ever been a member of an 
association, delivered a single leaflet, packed an envelope or knocked 
on a door?

'My activists are far from being 
'"swivel eyed loons". They are hard working people who care passionately
about local area & future of country.'

Headache: David Cameron faces trouble in the party as the rift over gay marriage widens

Nadine Dorries, who has criticised the
'chumocracy' of old friends surrounding Mr Cameron, wrote: 'If an MP 
described activists as mad swivel eyed loons they would be all over the 
Media. Why don't we know the name of the No10 aide?'

The Tory, who had the party whip 
restored earlier this month after her unauthorised appearance on I'm a 
Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!, tweeted that in her Mid Bedfordshire 
seat 'membership numbers increasing, activists are hard working, solid, 
decent, people AND truly representative of electorate'.

Relations between the party leadership
and grassroots traditionalists have been strained by Mr Cameron's 
support for gay marriage and over the thorny issue of Europe.

Many Tories are concerned by the rise 
of the United Kingdom Independence Party, which made spectacular gains 
at this month's local elections campaigning on issues which many 
Conservative traditionalists identify with.

The reports were instantly seized on 
by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who wrote on Twitter: 'If you are a 
Conservative supporter who believes in Ukip ideas then your party hates 
you. Come and join us.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said there was 'real sense of anger' about plans for gay marriage

Mr Cameron's authority could be dealt a
further blow next week as the same-sex marriage legislation returns to 
the Commons, with Tory MPs given a free vote and able to oppose it if 
they wish.

Tory Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
hit out at the Government's focus on gay marriage, saying there was a 
'real sense of anger' about it.

He said: 'There was no huge demand for
this and we didn't need to spend a lot of parliamentary time and upset 
vast numbers of people in order to do this.'
