The National Security Agency's director flatly denied as 'completely false' claims that U.S. intelligence agencies monitored tens of millions of phone calls in France and Spain during a month-long period beginning in late 2012.

Gen. Keith Alexander contradicted the news reports that said his NSA had collected data about the calls and stored it as part of a wide-ranging surveillance program, saying that the journalists who wrote them misinterpreted documents stolen by the fugitive leaker Edward Snowden.

And a key Democratic senator added that European papers that leveled the allegations 'got it all wrong' with respect to at least two countries – saying that it was those nations' intelligence services that collected the data and shared it with their U.S. counterparts as part of the global war on terror.

National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander testified Tuesday that the governments of France and Spain conducted surveillance on their own citizens' phone conversations, and then shared the intelligence data with the U.S.

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said foreign newspapers 'got it all wrong,' even as she proposed a top-to-bottom review of U.S. spying programs

On Monday newspapers in three countries published computer-screen images, reportedly provided by Snowden, showing what appeared to be data hoovered up by the United States from European citizens' phone calls.

But Alexander testified in a House Intelligence Committee hearing that 'those screenshots that show – or lead people to believe – that we, the NSA, or the U.S., collect that information is false.'

'The assertions by reporters in France, Spain and Italy that NSA collected tens of millions of phone calls are completely false,' Alexander said.

According to the French newspaper Le Monde and the Spanish daily El Mundo, the NSA had collected the records of at least 70 million phone calls in France and another 60.5 million in Spain between December and January.

Italy's L’Espresso magazine also alleged, with help from Snowden, that the U.S. was engaged in persistent monitoring of Italy's telecommunications networks.

General Alexander denied it all.

'To be perfectly clear, this is not 
information that we collected on European citizens. It represents 
information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our
countries and in support of military operations.'

Reporters,
he added, 'cite as evidence screen shots of the results of a web tool 
used for data management purposes, but both they and the person who 
stole the classified data did not understand what they were looking at.'

President Barack Obama said he is instituting a complete review of U.S. intelligence procedures in the wake of stinging allegations that the NSA has been peeping on foreign leaders through their phones and email accounts

California Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday that 'the papers got it all wrong on the two 
programs, France and Germany.'

'This was not the United States 
collecting on France and Germany. This was France and Germany 
collecting. And it had nothing to do with their citizens, it had to do 
with collecting in NATO areas of war, like Afghanistan.'

Feinstein on Monday called for a complete review of all the U.S. intelligence community's spying programs, saying that 'Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing.'

In the weekend's other intelligence bombshell, the U.S. stood accused of snooping on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and spying on Mexican President Felipe Calderon's private emails.

But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the committee that spying on foreign leaders is nothing new.

'That's a hardy perennial,' he said, 'and as long as I've been in the intelligence business, 50 years, leadership intentions, in whatever form that's expressed, is kind of a basic tenet of what we are to collect and analyze.'

'It's one of the first things I learned in intel school in 1963,' he assured the members of Congress, saying that the U.S. routinely spies on foreign leaders to ascertain their intentions, 'no matter what level you're talking about. That can be military leaders as well.'

Gen. Alexander said he would rather take his lumps with the public and the press than stop a program that protects Americans from future terror attacks

Clapper hinted that committee members had been briefed on such programs, saying that in cases where the NSA 
is surveilling foreign leaders, 'that should be reported to the 
committee ... in considerable detail' as a 'significant' intelligence 
activity over which Congress has oversight.'

He added that 'we do only what the policymakers, writ large, have actually asked us to do.'

Republican committee chair Mike 
Rogers of Michigan began the hearing by acknowledging that 'every nation
collects foreign intelligence' and 'that is not unique to the United 
States'.

Clapper pleaded with the panel to think carefully before restricting the government's ability to collect foreign intelligence, warning that they would be 'incurring 
greater risks' from overseas adversaries.

Gen. Alexander dispensed with his 
prepared statement and spoke 'from the heart,' saying that his agency 
would rather 'take the beatings' from reporters and the public 'than ... give up a 
program' that would prevent a future attack on the nation.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday afternoon that other U.S. officials had confirmed Alexander's version of events, and that the electronic spying in France and Spain was carried out by those nations' governments.

The resulting phone records, they said, were then shared with the NSA as part of a program aimed at keeping U.S. military personnel and civilians safe in areas of military conflict.

None of the nations involved would speak to the Journal about their own level of involvement in a scandal that initially touched only the U.S., but which now promises to embroil intelligence services on a global scale.
