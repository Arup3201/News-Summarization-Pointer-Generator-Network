Britons will not tolerate queues in stores as a new report reveals most would pay to use a self-service check out.

Many of the 54 per cent who said they would pay for the privilege claimed they are used to the instant automated service offered online.

New research into British shopping habits also found people want a hands-off experience, using technology to guide them, as 70 per cent of people use their mobile phone to aid their trip.

And when shoppers do want to speak to sales assistants, they expect more expert knowledge than they can find out online, finds the How We Shop Now report by Westfield.

The financial costs to 
retailers who exhibit poor service to shoppers with a zero-tolerance attitude - 
of whom there are many - is a staggering £5.4bn.

Savvy shoppers are also looking to technology for guidance and inspiration - 57 per cent are tempted by interactive digital displays.

Two thirds say they’d be interested in virtual mirrors, which allow customers to try on clothes in front of a mirror see how something looks on without ever entering a fitting room.

Retail guru Mary Portas says: 'In a world where the shopper truly is king, every retailer must maximise every touch point.

'People will vote with their feet, they expect a great experience. Ultimately, we will always ask "did I come in and get what I wanted?"'

Similarly, the report found our expectations of the shopping environment and the service we receive play a significant role in how we are shopping, which could be worth £5 billion a year in lost sales due to bad service.

Technology is making us crave efficiency and demand improved shopping spaces. Shoppers want inspiration and originality; they demand the whole package - from high-end brands to entertainment venues - all within one location.

As Britons become accustomed to the simplicity of online transactions, we become less tolerant of poor service. Today, two-thirds of shoppers would never use a store if it provided bad service.

And the self-assured 35-44 group are the least tolerant in this respect. As a result, retailers who fail to deliver excellent service are missing out on more than £5.4 billion of sales.

In fact, more than half would storm out if we had to wait too long for a changing room or had to queue too long to pay when tills are unmanned.

A similar number refuse to put up with a messy store.

And don't hassle them, as 41 per cent will flee if frequently accosted by staff members asking if they need help.

Increasingly, shoppers also want the entire shop to be faceless, not just the till point. They are less interested in staff assistance, with more than half preferring to be left alone unless they specifically ask for guidance.

Even luxury shoppers, who value butler service, prefer non-intrusive staff. When buying luxury goods, if visiting more expensive stores, three-quarters of us suddenly expect exceptional treatment, especially working mothers.

Professionalism is essential as three quarters of luxury shoppers (those who regularly visit high-end stores) demand it.

Luxury shoppers are also more likely to want retailers to offer up alternative options if an item is out of stock and to provide an adjustment service.

Similarly, almost half expect paid for express delivery to be offered. In terms of technology, almost twice as many luxury store lovers think having a free wi-fi service is important compared with standard store shoppers.

A nationwide 
programme of research was carried out across 8,000 UK shoppers between 
June 2013 and January 2014 by Westfield. It reveals not only How We Shop Now but 
how the future of shopping is changing.
