Curiosity has solved the mystery of how Mars lost its atmosphere.

Nasa's $2.5 billion rover has found evidence that as much as 90% of the original 
atmosphere there has dissipated into space over the planet's lifetime.

Curiosity also revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds.

Rover team members revealed the readings at the European Geosciences Union 2013 General Assembly, in Vienna.

Curiosity’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument analyzed an atmosphere sample last week using a process that concentrates selected gases.

The results provided the most precise measurements ever made of isotopes of argon in the Martian atmosphere. Isotopes are variants of the same element with different atomic weights.

'We found arguably the clearest and most robust signature of atmospheric loss on Mars,' said Sushil Atreya, a SAM co-investigator at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

SAM found that the Martian atmosphere has about four times as much of a lighter stable isotope (argon-36) compared to a heavier one (argon-38).

This removes previous uncertainty about the ratio in the Martian atmosphere from 1976 measurements from NASA’s Viking project and from small volumes of argon extracted from Martian meteorites.

The ratio is much lower than the solar system’s original ratio, as estimated from argon-isotope measurements of the Sun and Jupiter.

This points to a process at Mars that favored preferential 'leaking' of the lighter isotope over the heavier one.

The team also revealed the result of curiosity's weather monitoring.

Curiosity measures several variables in today’s Martian atmosphere with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS), provided by Spain.

While daily air temperature has climbed steadily since the measurements began eight months ago and is not strongly tied to the rover’s location, humidity has differed significantly at different places along the rover’s route.

These are the first systematic measurements of humidity on Mars, Nasa said.

Trails of dust devils have not been seen inside Gale Crater, but REMS sensors detected many whirlwind patterns during the first hundred Martian days of the mission, though not as many as detected in the same length of time by earlier missions.

'A whirlwind is a very quick event that happens in a few seconds and should be verified by a combination of pressure, temperature and wind oscillations and, in some cases, a decrease is ultraviolet radiation,' said REMS Principal Investigator Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid.

Dust distributed by the wind has been examined by Curiosity’s laser-firing Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument. Initial laser pulses on each target hit dust.

The laser’s energy removes the dust to expose underlying material, but those initial pulses also provide information about the dust.

'We knew that Mars is red because of iron oxides in the dust,” said ChemCam Deputy Principal Investigator Sylvestre Maurice of the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie in Toulouse, France.

'ChemCam reveals a complex chemical composition of the dust that includes hydrogen, which could be in the form of hydroxyl groups or water molecules.'

As the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite of instruments on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover heats a sample, gases are released (or "evolved") from the sample and can be identified using SAM's quadrupole mass spectrometer. Here are its first readings.

For the rest of April, Curiosity will carry out daily activities for which commands were sent in March, using DAN, REMS and the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD).

No new commands are being sent during a four-week period while Mars is passing nearly behind the Sun, from Earth’s perspective. This geometry occurs about every 26 months and is called Mars solar conjunction.
