The Tom Cruise film Jack Reacher prompted 26 complaints to the British Board of Film Classification last year

A record number of films were given a 12A rating last year raising concerns a growing number of children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex.

In 2012, 321 films were given this classification, up a third from 234 the previous year.

The rating means children aged 12 and over can go and see a film at the cinema or watch on DVD unaccompanied, and those under this age can also view the film with an adult.

The figures come on the same day it emerged Tom Cruise’s 12A hit Jack Reacher prompted the most number of complaints to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) over its’ violent, dark and sadistic’ content which was felt to be unsuitable for young children.

The thriller in which a man shoots dead five people using a sniper rifle and then flees had already been subject to a number of cuts to get it down to the certificate it actually achieved but still generated 26 complaints last year.

Wolverine, The Impossible and About Time were other 12A films that also saw the BBFC receive complaints in 2013 with many parents disapproving of the strong language often included, sexual references in some instances and the graphic content.

The rise in the number of 12A films comes despite a study by the BBFC, in January, showing 27 per cent of consumers were unable to describe accurately what the rating meant.

Patrick Swaffer, president of the BBFC, said in yesterday’s annual report more needed to be done to improve understanding.

Miranda Suit, co-founder of the Safer Media campaign group, said she always suspected that when the 12A category was introduced it would benefit the film industry far more than parents or children, and the record numbers of 12As in 2013 appears to confirm this.

Mrs Suit said: ‘12As are a gift to the industry – allowing a whole extra group of children, the under 12s, to provide a new revenue stream, as long as they are with an adult.

‘Meanwhile the BBFC are happy to allow surprisingly explicit violence and sadism in 12As, as evidenced by the complaints made about 12A Jack Reacher.

‘Explicit sex is also an issue, and the BBFC have actually relaxed controls on bad language in this category.

‘The BBFC need to provide much better protection – our children are far too precious to justify weighting regulation in favour of the industry rather than young people’s wellbeing.’

The movie Jack Reacher, featuring Rosamund Pike and Tom Cruise, was rated 12A but was called 'sadistic'

Earlier this year the BBFC said age ratings would be relaxed after claiming parents accept it is ‘game over’ when protecting their children from bad language.

Updating its guidance for cinema films and DVDs, the BBFC said from February 24 it would be ‘more flexible about allowing very strong language at 15’.

The changes also impact on 12A films which according to the new rules can now include strong language, such as f**k may be used regularly if in context and that moderate sex references are permitted.

As a result there are now concerns more films will be given a 12A rating this year and could generate more complaints from parents.

Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Mediawatch UK, said the findings and changes only highlight how children are being used to turn films into lucrative business ventures.

She said: ‘The increase would appear to underline the fact that producers want to get that crucial 12A rating because it means children can go and leads to a substantial increase in the potential audience.

‘You can sell a lot more lunchboxes and duvet covers linked to the film if under 12s have been allowed to see it.

‘The problem arises at the top end of the classification, when producers make a snip here and a cut there to a film so they can get the 12A rating. It does not always mean the film is suitable for children.’

A spokeswoman for the BBFC said: ‘The rise is not down to more strong language being allowed at 12A.

‘The very minor tweak in the Guidelines to take more account of context when classifying strong language at 12A only came into use in January this year and is unlikely to result in a sharp rise in films passed 12A.

‘The rise in 12A films in 2013 is more likely due to an increase in film submissions generally.’
