Police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi.

Durst, the subject of HBO's documentary series The Jinx, was arrested last weekend and was charged on Monday by L.A. officials in connection with the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman.

In the wake of Durst's arrest, Oakland police revealed that they and the FBI were looking into the possiblility that he was somehow involved in Modafferi's disappearance.

Police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi 

The 18-year-old student from North Carolina had gone missing after finishing work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. 

Durst was rumored to be living in the area around that time, reports The Wrap.

'The Oakland Police Department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modafferi,' said the police in a statement on Thursday.

'The investigation was open and active for several years. At this time we do not have any evidence that indicates Robert Durst was involved in her disappearance.'

Police in Eureka, California, do however remain interested in Durst in connection with another missing persons case.

Karen Mitchell, 16, was last seen on November 25, 1997 after leaving her aunt's Eureka home.

Eureka police said on Tuesday they would like to speak to Durst about his possible connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997

Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag. 

Investigative journalist Matt Birkbeck said on CNN this week that Durst frequented a homeless shelter where Mitchell volunteered, and he drove a car matching the description of one seen near the location where the girl vanished. 

Durst's arrest in New Orleans came the day before the finale of HBO series, The Jinx, about his links to the three killings. On the final episode, Durst made an apparent confession, saying in an unguarded moment: 'I killed them all, of course.'

On Tuesday, Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge. Questions also surfaced over his links to two missing California girls.

The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday.

Durst has been charged with murder over the execution-style shooting of friend, Susan Berman, 15 years ago in LA. 

He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York.  

In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas.

He admitted that he had shot neighbor, Morris Black, in the defense but that his actions were self-defense. At the time, Durst was living as an odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner.

Durst's lawyer does not believe his client suffers from acute mental illness, according to a brief filed by the sheriff's office on Tuesday.

A three-judge panel ruled that the sheriff has sole authority to decide where to house inmates needing mental health treatment.
