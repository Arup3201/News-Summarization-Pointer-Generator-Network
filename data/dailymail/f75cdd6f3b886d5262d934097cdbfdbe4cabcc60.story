Fifty-three people have been killed in a horror casino attack, which saw gunmen burst in and douse the building with petrol before setting alight to it, causing an inferno which sent black smoke belching into the sky.

In one of the deadliest single attacks since Mexican President Felipe Calderon launched his offensive against the drug cartels in 2006, Casino Royale in Monterrey lay in ruins after the blaze.

The fire at the two-storey building trapped gamblers, croupiers and other casino workers, who died of either smoke inhalation or burning.

Emergency servicemen were continuing to pull bodies from the ruins this morning as mourners gathered outside the police cordon in the northern city, which has recently seen an upsurge in drug cartel activity.

State police officials initially said
witnesses reported hearing three explosions before the fire 
started, but later said a flammable material was used.

The reports of explosions may have been the sound of the ignition of the liquid.

Monterrey has seen bloody turf battles between the Zetas and Gulf cartels in recent months.

Once
Mexico's symbol of development and prosperity, the city is seeing this 
year's drug-related murders on a pace to double last year's and triple 
those of the year before.

Last
month, gunmen killed 20 people at a bar in Monterrey - the attackers 
sprayed the bar with rounds from assault rifles, and police later found 
bags of drugs at the bar.

The fire was started at about 4pm on Thursday, according to local police

Survivors said the attackers were shouting profanities when they ordered the customers and employees to rush out of the casino,
but many fled further inside the 
building.

As a result they died trapped amid the flames and thick smoke that soon billowed out of the building.

The fire in the casino was reported 
just before 4pm yesterday - a relevantly quite period of the day when 
normally about 80 people played the tables and slots, according to 
former security guard Alberto Martinez Alvarado, 30.

Mr Martinez, who on his way home from work when he saw the fire, said the casino could hold hundreds, perhaps a thousand people.

'We're lucky we weren't there,' he said. 'Why couldn't the people who did this do some honest work instead?'

Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who launched his war on drug cartels in 2006 when he came to power, condemned the attack

The dead who were recovered were 
identified by their relatives at the morgue, though thanks to the blaze 
it is proving to be an arduous process.

Francisco
Tamayo, who lives in Monterrey, said he and family members looked at 
some 40 bodies in search of his mother, Sonia de la Pena, 47, who loved 
to gamble at the casino and was there on average four days a week.

They have yet to find her, the 28-year-old said, after they rushed to the scene having learned of the fire on the television.

Last night president Calderon, 49, used micro blogging site Twitter to condemn the attack and tweeted that it was 'an abhorrent act of terror and barbarism' that requires 'all of us to persevere in the fight against these unscrupulous criminal bands'.

Attorney General Leon Adrian de la Garza said a drug cartel appeared to be responsible for the attack, though he didn't not identify exactly which one.

Monterrey Mayor Fernando Larrazabal 
said many of the bodies were found inside the casino's bathrooms, where 
employees and customers had locked themselves to escape the gunmen.

Maria Tomas Navarro, 42, stood weeping at the edge of the police tape stretched in front of the smoke-stained casino building.

She was hoping for word of her brother, 25-year-old Genaro Navarro Vega, who had worked in the casino's bingo area.

Mrs Navarro said she tried calling 
her brother's mobile phone, 'but he doesn't answer,' she said. 'I don't 
know what is happening. There is nobody to ask.'

Cartels often extort casinos and other businesses, threatening to attack them or burn them to the ground if they refuse to pay.

It was the second time in only three months that the Casino Royale was targeted.

Gunmen struck it and three other casinos on May 25, spraying the building with bullets, but no was reported injured in that attack.
