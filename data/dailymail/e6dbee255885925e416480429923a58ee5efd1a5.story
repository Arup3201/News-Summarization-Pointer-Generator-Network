Pouting from behind her Gucci skiing goggles, posing on the slopes in fur-trimmed ski-wear, and showing off her tan in designer dresses - Gemma Harvieu's Facebook photographs boast of a life of glamour and luxury.

But today the 29-year-old Selfridges beautician was facing a possible jail sentence after admitting assisting her fugitive armed robber boyfriend Andrew Moran, 31, after he fled an English courtroom for life on Spain's Costa del Sol.

The gangster's moll dramatically changed her plea on the third day of her trial at Preston Crown Court, where she admitted charges of assisting an offender and money laundering.

Harvieu, who will be sentenced on Friday, admitted her guilt after a jury heard how she would join Moran - who jumped out of the dock at Burnley Crown Court in 2009 while on trial for robbing a Royal Mail van at gunpoint - at a string of exotic locations during his four years on the run.

In one 12-month period alone, the former lap dancer flew to Alicante to see Moran 23 times whilst earning a modest wage working on the cosmetics counter of the department store at the Trafford Centre, near Manchester.

Preston Crown Court was told that despite her relatively small income, Harvieu enjoyed a jet-set lifestyle and would regularly shop in the expensive stores on London's Bond Street.  She visited Paris, Pisa, the Alps and Vienna, where she bought a pedigree dog, the court heard.

Inquiries revealed Harvieu, of Chorlton, Greater Manchester, was helping wire money from Western Union outlets to Spain where Moran, from Salford, collected it using an assortment of false identities, it was said.

Before Moran escaped she was banking only £7,000 a year in her personal account.

Yet after he fled the UK, her account was used to field a string of deposits of up to £2,000 including a series of cash payments totalling £22,000 to help fund his life on the run.

It all ended on 10 May this year when Moran and Harvieu were caught in a police swoop as they relaxed by a pool at a villa near Alicante.

Armed officers found firearms, live ammunition, mobile phones and evidence false identities.

'This just wasn’t some rich boyfriend she had picked up in Spain who was treating her to a celebrity lifestyle In the Costa Del Sol away from her life back in Manchester,' said prosecutor Tim Brennand prosecuting.

'There was much much more to this. Moran was very much living the clichéd lifestyle of a resident of the so-called Costa Del Crime, and the inference is she was living out a life effectively as a gangster’s moll.

'The couple were spending time with one another. It is inconceivable that she was ignorant of the life she had chosen for herself with Moran. She was inextricably linked to his flight from justice and criminal lifestyle.'

Moran had gone on the run in March 2009 as he was standing trial over a £25,000 gunpoint raid on a Royal Mail delivery van.

Realising he was about to be remanded in custody at Burnley Crown Court, he vaulted over the dock and ran out into the street before officers had the time to take hold of him.

He later fled the UK after he used a false passport to buy a ticket for a Monarch Airlines flight to Alicante.

But while police were hunting Moran, from December 2009 to May 2011 Harvieu flew 22 times with Monarch from Manchester to Alicante- sometimes twice a month - allegedly to see him.

In 2010 she flew to Alicante 23 times with some of the flights paid for by Moran, his sister and his friends. She would arrive back in the UK after trips only to return shortly after by Eurostar.

Expensive tastes: Jurors at Preston Crown Court heard Harvieu enjoyed shopping on London's Bond Street 

A European arrest warrant was issued for Moran in 2010 and in November 2012 Spanish police set a road block to trap him.

But Moran spotted the officers in uniform, rammed his 4x4 car through the police cordon and drove off in the wrong direction away from the trap set for him.

Police searched his flat and found firearms, cash, drugs and false identities were seized but the trail went cold until he was tracked down to the villa in Alicane with Harvieu.

Mr Brennand added: 'He was using a variety of false passports, and mobile phones and they were enjoying the high life. Photos showed a variety of cars and motorcycles and Andrew Moran posing with weapons.

'It demonstrates more about the brazen personality of Andrew Moran and a fascination for ammunition and drugs and that he had done very well for himself after leaving the dock at Burnley Crown Court.'

Police analysed Harvieu’s Halifax Ultimate Reward Current Account and spoke to work colleagues who said she had no longer wanted to work at Selfridges after meeting a man in Spain.

Between March 2009 and November 2012 a total of £38,930 in cash deposits were made including cash payments totalling £22,335 in 2010.

She was entrusted to send money to allocated names in five transactions totalling £4,000 between November 2010 and 7 December 2010 all being collected in Spain.

Mr Brennand said: 'The cash lodgements were the sort that would not trigger money-laundering alarm bells. It was deposit after deposit after deposit.

'The location was consistent, we can see spending in shops, establishments in Manchester, Bond Street in London and locations in Spain and Europe where money is going in and out of the UK.

Escape: Andrew Moran flees a trial at Burnley Crown Court in 2009

The court heard Harvieu denied ever knowing Moran was a fugitive or a criminal - even though his escape was reported in newspapers and on BBC’s Crimewatch programme.

Mr Brennand said: ’The television is a funny thing, when it touches you the natural thing we do is tell friends, family, you tell anybody and everybody you possibly can.

'Looking at their relationship, it is simply inconceivable that she was not aware of who he was or what he was. Applying commonsense she would have discovered the truth.'
