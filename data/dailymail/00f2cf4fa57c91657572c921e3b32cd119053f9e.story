A plague of rats in gardens and playgrounds could be on the way thanks to new health and safety rules that go beyond European Union guidance, pest control experts claim.

The Health and Safety Executive would like the use of so-called ‘second generation’ rat poisons restricted to within 16ft of buildings.

The Government agency is worried that predators in the countryside such as foxes and birds of prey will ingest the two poisons - difenacoum and bromadiolone, reported the Daily Telegraph.

However pest control experts gamekeepers are adamant that the poisons are not eaten by other animals if used correctly - and only a fractional amount is ingested even when errors are made.

Some 128,000 rat treatments carried out annually would be made illegal by the ban, according to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, reported the Telegraph.

The Country Land and Business Association and the Countryside Alliance claim the ban will make it tougher to control rats in parks and urban wasteland, and say the HSE is going further than it should.

The European Commission is only said to be currently considering greater controls on chemicals.

The products are used in wider countryside areas by around 75 per cent of gamekeepers, according to the National Gamekeepers Organisation.

'We have a pretty bad situation with rats in open countryside as it is and it could easily get worse'

Rats are mostly resistant to the first generation of poison - warfarin - reported the Telegraph.

Mike Swan, of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, told the newspaper: ‘We have a pretty bad situation with rats in open countryside as it is and it could easily get worse.’

But a Health and Safety Executive spokesman insisted that the poisons should be restricted to ‘in and around buildings’.
