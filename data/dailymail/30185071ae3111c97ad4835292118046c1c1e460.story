A woman who admitted to kidnapping two Amish girls with her boyfriend says they were on a 'shopping trip' for slaves.

The details of the girls', aged 7 and 12, abduction was further revealed in a hearing Thursday for Nicole Vaisey in St Lawrence County, NY court. 

Vaisey turned herself into police last week after she and boyfriend Stephen Howells Jr kidnapped the two Amish girls from their family farm near Oswegatchie, New York - luring them to a parked car with a puppy.

Under orders: Vaisey's defense attorney says she was her boyfriend's 'slave' and therefore 'not as culpable' in the kidnapping

The 25-year-old's attorney says she was in a 'master-slave relationship' with her boyfriend, and therefore not as culpable for the crime.

The girls were held against their will for 24 hours, but eventually released after the couple became frightened by broadcasts about the massive search. 

After coming forward to police, Vaisey detailed her dominant/submissive relationship with Howells and how they went about searching for slaves.

The couple faces charges of kidnapping with intent to sexually abuse or physically hard the girls.

She says the couple had been looking for  slaves, and she decided on the two Amish girls after previously buying produce from their farm stand. She described the search as a 'shopping trip'.

On August 13, Howells dropped off his three children with his ex around 6:30pm and then the couple went to the farm stand, where Vaisey parked their white car out of sight, underneath a tree.

Her boyfriend then got out and greeted the two girls, asking if they wanted to see a puppy he had in the back seat of the car.

The couple tied the golden retriever/Doberman mix to the driver's side in the back seat, so that the girls would have to lean in, in order to pet.

The girls agreed, but on the way to the car, one of them got scared and started to scream. 

That's when Howells forced the girls into the back of the vehicle and Vaisey sped off back to their home in Hermon.  

Relief: Amish community members gather at the home of the two kidnapped girls, after their return Thursday

Vaisey says the girls spent most of their time as captives shackled to the couple's bed.

But after about 24 hours, the couple became frightened by the news broadcasts about the girls' disappearance, and decided to drop them off in an isolated area near Bigelow, New York.

Authorities previously said the girls were sexually abused before the couple let them go.

The girls ran to the first house they found, and the couple who answered the door then drove them home.

While Ms Vaisey did not testify at her hearing on Thursday, her attorney said that the nature of her relationship with Howells should factor into the trial.

'She was in a master-slave relationship,' her attorney Bradford Riendeau said Thursday. 'I believe she's not as culpable as he is.' 

'She was the submissive one,' he said last week. 'I am currently researching on what happens when prisoners of war go through enhanced interrogation. What torture has done to her personality to determine just how compliant she was? Was it really voluntary? Can you really give consent to be tortured?'

Howells waived his right to a hearing, so that his case may go straight to a grand jury.

Home: The girls' disappearance launched a major search in the area. The couple was arrested on Friday at their home in Richville, New York (investigators pictures searching the home above) 

Horrifying: Howells Jr has three children of his own, and dropped them off with an ex before kidnapping the two Amish sisters, his girlfriend Vaisey revealed 

The girls' kidnappings touched off a massive search in the Amish family's remote farming community. Searchers scoured the community of about 4,000 people but were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls.

The Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work with an artist who spoke their language, a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a sketch of the older girl.

The parents, who have 14 children, did not express anger toward the suspects.
