Jimmy Savile harassed the wife of a record label boss at a dinner party hosted by Tony Blair at Chequers, it has been revealed.

Alan McGee said he had wanted to punch Savile after he persistently chatted up and tried to kiss his wife Kate.

The New Labour donor, who discovered rock band Oasis, said he  resisted only because he did not want to embarrass Mr Blair.

Harassed: Alan McGee and his wife Kate, who he says was pestered by disgraced former DJ Jimmy Savile at a private dinner hosted by Tony Blair at Chequers

Mr McGee, 53, said: ‘At dinner, Kate was 
between Jimmy Savile and Judi Dench. Savile started to hit on Kate, 
kissing his way up her arms, kissing her fingers.

‘I was thinking, 
“What a dirty old man” but at Chequers it’s not done to break Jimmy 
Savile’s nose.

‘Kate came over and said, “He’s a pervert”. He left her 
alone once she was next to me.’

Last night Mrs McGee told the Daily 
Mail: ‘I was shown to my seat next to Savile... Suddenly I felt his hand
go down my neck and I thought, “I can’t believe that just happened”.

'It
was so inappropriate. I couldn’t believe someone could be so confident
to do that knowing they could get a glass of wine thrown in their face 
while they were a guest at Chequers.

‘He knew I was married and my 
husband was at the table. But I was too polite and the etiquette of the 
occasion meant that I put up with it.

Powerful friends: Jimmy Saville with then Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1998. The event at Chequers took place a year later

‘I used to Love Jim’ll Fix It when I was a child. Thank God my request was never accepted.’

Mr
McGee, who donated around £100,000 to Labour, added: ‘I couldn’t tell 
[Savile] was paedophile, but there was an edge to him, a quiet menace, 
the threat of violence.

'I come from Glasgow, I can tell when someone is 
dangerous. I could tell he was connected. He was over 70 but I’m 
convinced he was a gangster.’

He added: ‘It was as if he was the host
rather than Tony. He was speaking to the whole table, except when he 
was trying to suck Kate’s fingers.

'It really shows the connection he had
to the Establishment. I don’t think we’ve heard the half of what he got
up to.’

The dinner party, which Mr McGee has written about in his 
book Creation Stories: Riots, Raves and Running a Label, took place at 
the Buckinghamshire retreat in 1999.

Seat of power: The dinner attended by Mr McGee and Savile was at the PM's country residence Chequers

Mr McGee introduced Mr Blair to 
Oasis founder Noel Gallagher at No 10 following the 1997 election, 
before their relationship soured.

Savile once boasted he spent ‘11 
consecutive Christmases at Chequers’, which is four miles from Stoke 
Mandeville Hospital, where he abused many of his victims.

He is thought 
to visited Chequers only once while Mr Blair was in office.
