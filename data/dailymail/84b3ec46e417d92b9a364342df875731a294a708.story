When Elon Musk split up with wife, Talulah Riley, for the first time, he told the whole world.

'It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever,' the entrepreneur Tweeted to the British actress in January 2012. 'You will make someone very happy one day.'

Eighteen months later, that happy person apparently was him, as they tied the knot again in July 2013.

Split again: California billionaire Elon Musk and actress wife Talulah Riley were together for a year after they remarried, but they have lived apart the past five months

The rekindled romance didn't last. On Wednesday — the day many people make vows for the coming year — the couple officially broke their marital vow. Musk filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court on New Year's Eve.

The couple said they were splitting amicably and that Musk agreed to give Riley $16million in cash and other assets as part of a financial settlement, according to a joint statement. A divorce filing said property would be split based on a prenuptial agreement.

Musk made a fortune co-founding PayPal and has gone on to start SpaceX and Tesla Motors. Riley, 29, appeared in Pride & Prejudice, Inception and St. Trinians.

The couple first wed in 2010. They didn't have any children, but Musk has five sons from a previous marriage. 

Musk and Riley were together for a year after they remarried, but they have lived apart the past five months while Riley wrote and directed her first feature film, 'Scottish Mussel,' in the United Kingdom.

Who get's what? In 2013, Elon Musk bought this 20,000-square-foot Bel Air home for a reported $17 million. A divorce filing said the couple's property would be split based on a prenuptial agreement.

Elon Musk was married to Canadian novelist Justine Musk for eight years--long enough for her to bear his five sons and to become, in her own words, his 'starter wife.'

In a tell-all 2010 interview with Marie Claire, the former Mrs. Musk said:

In the late spring of 2008, my wealthy entrepreneurial husband, Elon Musk, the father of my five young sons, filed for divorce. Six weeks later, he texted me to say he was engaged to a gorgeous British actress in her early 20s who had moved to Los Angeles to be with him. 

Her name is Talulah Riley, and she played one of the sisters in 2005's Pride and Prejudice. Two of the things that struck me were: a) Pride and Prejudice is a really good movie, and b) My life with this man had devolved to a cliché.

'Starter wife': Elon Musk's first wife and mother of his five sons Justine was very public about their acrimonious divorce 

Musk describes in the interview her courtship and ensuing life with the famous mogul and the details range from sweet to downright creepy.

As we danced at our wedding reception, Elon told me, 'I am the alpha in this relationship.'

When she insisted she wasn't Elon's employee, Justine claimed her husband would say, 'If you were my employee, I would fire you.'

As part of her extensive blogging regarding their divorce, Justine would come clean about her demands:

The house; alimony and child support; $6 million cash; 10 per cent of his stock in Tesla; 5 per cent of his stock in (ed: space transport company) SpaceX (and he retains all voting rights) and a Tesla Roadster (I really, really want one ...) 

Man of many talents: Musk founded Tesla Motors, an electric car company that had a $226 million initial public offering in 2010

The two said they remain friends.

Musk did not immediately Tweet news of the divorce Wednesday.

Mr Musk, a South African who attended the University of Pennsylvania, made his fortune by founding a series of highly-successful ventures -- beginning with Zip2, which produced online content publishing software that was purchased in 1999 for nearly $340million.

Later, for his next venture, Mr Musk helped create PayPal, the online money transfer and payment service. Ebay bought PayPal for $1.2billion in 2002.

He founded Space X later that year -- a outer space exploration company. In 2009, the company launched the first privately-owned liquid-fueled rocket ever to enter space. Space X now has a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station that is worth between $1.6billion and $3.1billion.

Mr Musk also founded Tesla Motors, an electric car company that had a $226million initial public offering in 2010. 

After his newest divorce from Talulah Riley, Musk will have shelled out around $20M to the British actress for their combined divorce agreements. But with a net worth around $1 billion, the futurist entrepreneur can stand to lose a few bucks
