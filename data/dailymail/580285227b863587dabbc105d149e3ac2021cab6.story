Sol Campbell has put his London home on the market for a whopping £25million - just days after slamming the proposed mansion tax.

The ex-England star called the controversial levy a 'cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well' just over two weeks ago.

Campbell, 40, is now selling his Thames-side six-bedroom home in London, which overlooks the river and the stunning Albert Bridge.

The beautiful Thames-side home, on the market for £25million, is in the exclusive Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, south-west London

It offers beautiful views over the famous river and of the nearby Albert Bridge, which crosses the Thames next to Battersea Park

The property has five bathrooms, a drawing room, library, dining room and a separate mews home at the rear.

It underwent a renovation in 2008 with Campbell's wife, Fiona Barrett-Campbell, designing the interior.

The listed home has 7,224 sq/ft of space and also features a lift, 45ft garden and an underground tunnel which links the main home and the mews property at the rear.

Campbell has now put it up for sale with the John D. Wood estate agency for £25million.

A spokesman for the agency has declined to discuss the property, which is also available to rent through Knight Frank for £15,000 a week.

It comes onto the market less than a month after the ex-Arsenal defender's stinging criticism of the proposed mansion tax.

The property - which has six bedrooms, five bathrooms - was renovated in 2008 by Campbell's wife, Fiona Barrett-Campbell

It also features a 'mews house' at the end of the garden, which is connected to the main property by an underground tunnel

It is estimated Campbell would have to pay £250,000 'mansion tax' on the property if the proposal ever became law

Setting out the idea, Labour leader Ed Miliband has said that owners of properties worth more than £2millon would face an annual charge in future.

Under the proposed tax, Campbell would have to pay an estimated £250,000 per year on his property to the government.

In an extraordinary series of tweets last month, Campbell launched a scathing attack on the idea and the Labour party.

He wrote: '#MansionTax? Why should we except this? @UKLabour are the grim reaper of business entrepreneurs or anyone that has done well!

'Some people only have their houses to support their incomes, some have been lucky or have risked a lot with their properties.

'They don't trust bankers or the stocks and shares market and now labour want to penalise everyone with a £2million+ home!'

In an angry series of tweets last month, Campbell - whose home has a 45-feet garden (pictured) - attacked the idea of a mansion tax

He branded Labour 'the grim reaper of business' for suggesting the idea and proclaimed: 'An Englishman's home is his castle!'

The property, on the market with John D. Wood estate agency, is also available to rent through Knight Frank for £15,000 a week

He added: 'This Tax on homes is a cheap & easy way to extract money from individuals that have done well! Does @UKLabour want to kill the top market?

'They talk about rolling the tax up when you sell your home! We already have stamp duty which has gone up, capital gains tax, death duties.'

He went on: 'Suggestion: separate & flexible council tax linked to actual earning; if you earn a lot you pay more, if not working you pay very little?

'Think out of the box @UKLabour. Don't go back, look forward. An Englishman's home is his castle, there will be uproar with this tax!

'Look after the needy and embrace the people and companies who make this country great! Listen to @George_Osborne @Conservatives last night!'

Campbell once dated interior designer Kelly Hoppen, but he then become involved with her protégée, the then-Fiona Barratt, who had worked for Miss Hoppen for three years.

In July 2010, he married Miss Barratt - who left Miss Hoppen's firm where she had become head of interior design to set up her own firm in May 2006.

Interestingly, Campbell had commissioned Miss Hoppen to design his Chelsea town house - a job which subsequently went to his wife following the split.
