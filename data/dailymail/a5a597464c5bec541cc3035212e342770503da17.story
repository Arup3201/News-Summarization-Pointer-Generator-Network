We may be harvesting a formidable crop of Olympic medals - but when it comes to celebrating, man mountain Robert Harting can teach us a thing or two about style.

Unlike many of our athletes,the 6ft 7in discus champion didn't bother shedding a tear when he took gold with a mammoth throw.

Instead, he tore his shirt off Incredible Hulk style, flexed his muscles with a mighty roar and grabbed a German flag from the Olympic stadium. Then he tried his luck at another gold medal, this time in the women's hurdles. The track had already been set up for the women's 100 metre final but Harting wasn't going to let the hurdles become barriers to his victory lap.

You wouldn't like him when he's angry: Robert Harting joyfully rips his shirt off Incredible Hulk-style after claiming gold last night in the discus

Celebration time: Harting was not shy in displaying his happiness at being crowned Olympic discus champion

Unleash the beast: Harting left Olympic Stadium spectators in no doubt how he felt about his latest discus win, which he clinched with a throw of 68.27m

So despite his 20 stone bulk, he jumped nearly all of them, cheered on by a delighted crowd in the 80,000 seat stadium. Next, he raced towards the Olympic cauldron, reached in, and attempted unsuccessfully to liberate one of the flaming prongs.

Finished now Herr Harting? Er, not quite. After leaving the stadium he headed out with friends and team-mates for a night to remember. If only he could. 

His extraordinary celebration continued aboard a German cruise liner docked in London to accommodate the Teutonic team, embraced an alcohol-fuelled night on the tiles - and ended with him falling asleep on a train, being robbed, and barred entry to the Olympic village yesterday after losing his accreditation.

Ripping it up: Harting has apparently made it a victory tradition to tear up his shirt after each discus win

Beat that for Olympic gold! The first fans and friends knew of his troubles came when he Tweeted in (almost) English: 'Puuh i just got robbed while I did some work to please athletic fans! I lost all my accredition [sic] for Olympic Village! - no entrance.'

Shortly after dawn he managed to get a message to German team manager Siegfried Schonert but had to wait until 8am before arrangements were made to get him in.

First reports said he went to bed 'dead tired' - and without realising he was no longer in possession of his kit and equipment.

Don't stop me now: Harting, 27, showed impressive hurdling ability despite weighing in at 20-stone

Jumping for joy: After ripping his shirt off, Harting continued his 
victory lap by vaulting the hurdles which had been placed for the 
women's 100m final

Lap of honour: The big German vaulted all the 100m hurdles, to huge applause from the Olympic Stadium crowd

No stopping me: Harting went on from his impromptu hurdles vault to a drinking session on a German cruise liner, before falling asleep on a train and having his bag stolen

After waking up without his bag following his celebratory exploits, Harting took to Twitter to reveal the predicament he found himself in

Back home in the Fatherland, however, he was hailed as a hero. In his native Berlin, officials were preparing a homecoming victory parade and were singing his praises. Social Democrat mayor Klaus Wowereit described his victory as 'Phenomenal'.

He added: 'He is, and remains, a symbol of Berlin sport. Berlin is proud.' Meanwhile the athlete's stadium antics took off on YouTube (and possibly on CCTV somewhere along the Docklands Light Railway).

Harting, unbeaten in a straight run of 29 competitions, is known as Lord of the Ring by fans, a reference to the circle from which the discus is thrown.

Harting's throw of 68.27m - the width of a football pitch - saw him crowned Olympic champion for the first time

His winning mark for the 2012 games was a formidable 68.27 metres, the width of an Olympic football pitch.

The big German is unlikely to face any disciplinary measures for his exuberance, although officials did inspect the Olympic cauldron afterwards for possible damage. He was even allowed a lie-in yesterday.

German medal winners are normally expected to be on public parade at 9.00am on the morning following their victory but Harting was allowed to sleep in and attend the afternoon one instead.
