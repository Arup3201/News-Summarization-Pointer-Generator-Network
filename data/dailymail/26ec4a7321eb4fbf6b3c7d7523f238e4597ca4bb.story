A mother and daughter locked in a bitter £150,000 court battle over the family estate agency have had their claims thrown out by a judge.

Nicola Low, 71, of Knebworth, Hertfordshire, had been sued by Caroline Baines, 40, who claimed her mother reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave.

A stream of angry letters then culminated in Mrs Low making a complaint to police and the arrest of her daughter’s innocent business partner, who was held in a police cell for five hours.

In a counter-claim, Mrs Low, a postmistress and boss of Halcyon House lettings agency, sued her daughter for £100,000 for setting up a new agency and allegedly stealing her clients.

Mrs Baines, who now runs Mint Lettings and Management, and her business partner Susan Mogridge, accused Mrs Low of harassment and asked for £50,000 damages.

Last Friday - after an 11-day High Court hearing - Judge Richard Seymour QC lamented the ‘most unhappy family discord’ and dismissed both mother and daughter’s claims.

Criticising Mrs Low’s behaviour in making a ‘malicious’ complaint to police, the judge said there was ‘no obvious reason’ for taking legal action against her daughter ‘other than spite’

After relations between the two women fell down in 2010 and their business relationship parted, Mrs Low contacted Hertfordshire Constabulary to accuse Mrs Mogridge of thieving.

The judge said: ‘The contents of the police statement strike me as outrageous. It contained a number of bare-faced lies.

‘Mrs Low was setting out not merely to be mischievious, but malicious, in making complaints to the police which she must have know were totally without any justification.

‘It reflects further discredit upon her that she was also fairly obviously seeking to implicate her daughter in the allegations of theft against Mrs Mogridge. The whole strategy was extremely nasty.

'The decision of Hertfordshire police even to investigate the complaints of Mrs Low, still less to arrest Mrs Mogridge, was not a tribute to the intelligence of the officers concerned'

Judge Richard Seymour QC

‘It is obvious that, by making her complaint to the police, Mrs Low was setting out to cause trouble for Mrs Mogridge and also, if possible, for Mrs Baines.’

And criticising the local force, the judge added: ‘The decision of Hertfordshire police even to investigate the complaints of Mrs Low, still less to arrest Mrs Mogridge, was not a tribute to the intelligence of the officers concerned.

‘Mrs Mogridge was detained for some five hours after her arrest before being released on bail.’

In February 2010, Mrs Low told Mrs Baines that she would receive only her statutory minimum maternity pay just a few days after the caesarean delivery of her grandson, Henry.

That was a ‘dramatic reduction’ in Mrs 
Baines’ usual salary, said the judge. The younger woman was furious and 
the incident was a crucial factor in her decision to set up Mint 
Lettings in direct rivalry to her mother.

The court heard Mrs Baines had been managing director of Halcyon House, owning 45 per cent of the shares, and her mother, who founded the business, had always intended that her daughter should eventually take full control.

However, James Purnell, for Mrs Baines, said that, by the time she gave birth to Henry, her mother had ‘wanted to take her out of the equation’.

Judge Richard Seymour QC

Mrs Low accused her daughter of making use of confidential company information to ‘pinch’ many of her best clients, but the judge ruled that Mrs Baines had in no way breached her employment contract or duties as a director.

Also dismissing Mrs Baines’s harassment claim, the judge said some of her accusations against her mother were ‘frankly ludicrous’.

‘Irritating, annoying, unattractive or unreasonable’ behaviour could not, by itself, amount to harassment, nor could the ‘manoeuvring for commercial advantage’ that would be expected in the estate agency industry, the judge said.

He said he was ‘entirely satisfied’ that Mrs Low’s complaint to the police against Mrs Mogridge, who formerly worked for Halcyon House, was ‘malicious’ and made ‘with a view to causing alarm, distress and anxiety’.

But that single incident, he ruled, was not a ‘course of conduct’ that could be called harassment.
