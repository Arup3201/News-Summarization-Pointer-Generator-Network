Jeopardy! champion Arthur Chu left the game show on Wednesday with a whopping $300,000 in prize money - but don't expect this crafty contestant to go blowing his win on champagne and limousines.

The 30-year-old insurance 
compliance analyst, from Broadview Heights, Ohio, said today that he plans to spend the money wisely on a vacation for his wife Eliza and invest in property.

Mr Chu finished third on Wednesday's edition of Jeopardy!- and overall took home close to $300,000 after controversial tactics which polarized viewers.

Champion Chu: Arthur, who took home close to $300,000 in prize money before finally being kicked off Jeopardy! on Wednesday, told GMA today that he planned to spend the money wisely

After finishing in first place for 12 
days, he came last on Wednesday with zero dollars after answering 
incorrectly on a question about the British monarchy. 

Chu's Jeopardy! strategy involved ditching 
the time-honored practice of polishing off each category's questions one
 by one. Instead, he took a hopscotch approach to his category choices, 
which tended to keep his opponents off-kilter.

He
 also concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely 
to contain the hidden Daily Doubles and he played accordingly.

Chu's
 strategy fueled indignation from Jeopardy! traditionalists, who 
contended that such an aggressive style was somehow unsportsmanlike and 
exhibited a lack of respect for the game.

Mr Chu told GMA
 on Thursday: 'I spent a lot of time preparing. There's a huge online 
community talking about this stuff, discussing the games. If you immerse
 yourself in the culture, you can find out about this stuff.'

He said that his wife was really happy with his huge win along with his mom who watched Chu from the studio audience.

Jeopardy! champ Arthur Chu plans to take his wife Eliza Blair on a vacation to China

When asked how he would spend his prize money of $297,200, he said: 'I don't want to do anything crazy or stupid.'

He plans to take his wife to China on vacation because she has never been and he wants to visit relatives he hasn't seen in a long time.

Mr Chu also said he planned to buy a house in the future. 

Mr Chu was unseated by Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who led for the day with $15,700.

The reigning champ had struggled for much of the show when, in Final Jeopardy, he risked, 
and lost, his entire day's bankroll - $6,400 - on the question: 'He was 
the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.'

Only Peloquin had the correct response: George VI.

The
 30-year-old Chu described 
himself on Twitter as 'mad genius, comedian, actor and freelance 
voiceover artist'.

He 
applied a 'mad genius' approach to Jeopardy! brinkmanship. 

Chu
 'rejected the unwritten rule that the guy or gal with the most facts 
wins,' said On the Media host Brooke Gladstone on an episode of the 
public radio show last month, 'and replaced it with the appalling idea 
that you can outwit your opponent with the wily application of game 
theory'.

It was a style 
much different from that of legendary know-it-all Ken Jennings, who a 
decade ago set a Jeopardy! record with 74 consecutive victories while 
winning $2.5 million.

Chu, an insurance 
compliance analyst, who does freelance voiceovers, spent a month 
studying the quiz where people guess the questions to answers that pop 
up on the screen.

When
 he first appeared on the show earlier this year, he baffled opponents 
by picking squares at random and betting strange amounts on his answers,
 rather than moving down the board in a straight line.

Arthur
 calls the strategy, which aims to disarm his opponents, Forrest Bounce,
 after successful 1980s player Chuck Forrest who also 'bounced' around 
the board.

His controversial strategy helped him win 12 times in a row.

The strategy sparked outrage across social media, as viewers accused Mr Chu of 'unsportsmanship'.

But Mr Chu dismissed the furor, telling Fox News: 'Like any game, strategy plays a big role.'

He
 added: 'I can't change your impression of me but, again, we're playing 
for money. Between $10,000 and getting haters on Twitter, $10,000 is 
more important to me.'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Arrgh: Arthur's game-play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure

The 
so-called 'evil genius', as dubbed by angry Twitter users, has also 
received support from the show's host Megyn Kelly, who said Arthur 
'seems to get' the concept of winning.

In the game, three contestants stand behind lecterns with a buzzer, a screen and a light pen.

They
 are presented with answers to questions on a range of topics - history,
 science, arts, popular culture, literature, and languages - and must 
guess what was asked to reach them.

Each
 category has five clues, ranked in order of difficulty. For every 
correct answer, the player wins the value of the square - the easiest is
 $200, the hardest is $1,000.

There
 are also 'Daily Doubles', where a contestant can stake as much money as
 they want on a pot luck question in the hope of doubling it.

Arthur is quick and confident with his answers, darting from a $1,000 question to $200 for seemingly no reason.

But he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as Philly.com are calling him a 'hero', whilst others blogs like BarStool describe him as a 'mad genius'.

Before appearing on the show, Arthur claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years.

'I
 decided pretty early on, you know, I'm not going to be able to learn 
all the things I don't know in terms of actual knowledge,' he says.

'You
 only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out
 for the show. So I said, 'What's the strategy that'll serve me best on 
the show?' It seems that people don't actually think about the strategy 
of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge.'

'I
 quickly found stories about former champions like Roger Craig and David
 Madden and Chuck Forrest who've bucked the tradition of starting at the
 top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success 
in the game.'

'There's no 
logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by 
surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next 
clue is going to be, you gain a major advantage over them. One of the 
few parts of the game you actually have any control over is your power 
to select the next question after answering a question correctly,' he 
told MailOnline.

Arthur has been tweeting his performance each night on his Twitter account @arthur_effect and through Facebook.
