Prisoners convicted of violent crimes are getting free weddings if they tie the knot behind bars.

Cash for the 27 marriages that took place inside prisons in Scotland – and even the buffet – came from the jail kitty, which is made up of profits from the prison shop.

Among those who have tied the knot in the last decade include Alistair Ferrier, who married partner Joanne Dye at Perth Prison, less than six months after he was put in prison for a drink-drive crash which resulted in the death of two pensioners and injured a third.

HMP Perth Prison hosted the most weddings in Scotland last year as well as convicted Alistair Ferrier's

Stuart McKelvie of Edinburgh, who was jailed for the murder of Ian Taylor in 2008 when he savagely set him on fire and sliced his ear off before leaving him in woodland, was also allowed to marry in prison.

Other inmates walking down the aisle include murderers, drug dealers and burglars – all of whom were men.

But the prison service has said weddings for inmates are ‘beneficial’ in the rehabilitation process.

A spokesman from the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said: ‘A small number of prisoners are granted permission to marry by the Governor.

‘SPS recognises the benefit in strengthening family support for prisoners in terms of preparation for release and reducing reoffending.’

He added: ‘It is not a wedding in a grand hotel, it’s a prison.’

The service notes that if the ceremony is free if it is conducted by the prison’s chaplain and if it is a civil ceremony then the cost of a registrar must be met by couple

It says in some prisons the cost of a buffet, for a maximum of six guests plus the couple, is covered by the Common Good Fund, which comes from donations and profits raised from sales in the on-site shop.

The prison service spokesman added: ‘The food comes from the prison canteen, it includes cheap sandwiches and sausage rolls. The expense is minimal.’

Couples are also entitled to use an artificial flower arrangement free of charge.

However Bob Lewis, 84, of taxpayer campaign group Is It Fair? told the Sunday Post: ‘Inmates are in a prison to serve a sentence because they’ve done something wrong, not to be rewarded like this’.

Andy Silvester from the Taxpayers Alliance said: 'Law-abiding taxpayers outside jail walls have to pay for their own weddings, and prisoners should be no different.

'People up and down the UK think long and hard about whether they can afford to tie the knot, and will be furious that they're paying so others don't have to face that same decision.'
