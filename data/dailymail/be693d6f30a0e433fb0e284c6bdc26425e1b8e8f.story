She was the chirpy, zany, Northern blonde who became the nation’s favourite female clown. But Dora Bryan, who died yesterday at the age of 91, was far more than just a comedienne.

At the height of her glittering 70-year career she won a BAFTA best actress award for her performance in the film A Taste Of Honey, a Laurence Olivier Award for her role in The Birthday Party at the National Theatre and was invested with the Order of the British Empire in 1996.

She starred on the West End stage in the title role of Hello, Dolly! and for five years was one of the stars of television’s marathon hit, Last Of The Summer Wine. She was at one time Britain’s highest-paid showbusiness star.

Yet behind the scenes life was an irrational mix of triumph and tragedy for Dora, who was born in Southport to an Oldham mill owner.

Unsuspected by her adoring public, she faced heartbreak and disasters. But when she dazzled, she dazzled like a meteorite.

Aged 32, she appeared in her first West End hit musical. Her show-stopping performance caused the impresario Peter (later Sir Peter) Saunders to telephone her after the rave reviews. ‘Can you get to the theatre early this evening?’ he asked. ‘There’s something I want to show you.’

When she arrived at the stage door, Saunders walked her along Drury Lane and pointed to the front of the theatre. She looked up, and there, in lights, were the words DORA BRYAN in THE WATER GIPSIES.

‘It was one of those magic moments in life that one can never capture again,’ she said.

From that 
moment on, she was an acclaimed and major star who counted even the 
master of comedy himself, Noël Coward, among her ardent fans.

Men
 were charmed and delighted by her, but there was only one man in her 
eyes. She had fallen in love at 17 with the handsome professional 
cricketer Bill Lawton, who had played for Lancashire against the 
Australians.

Following
 ‘one of the longest courtships in history’, they finally married after 
14 years on her 31st birthday. The Press had a field day when, as they 
emerged from St Thomas’s Church, Oldham, on a bitter February Sunday, he
 picked her up in his arms and carried her over the snowy ground.

Despite
 their happiness and her success in The Water Gipsies she suffered the 
first of a long series of breakdowns three months into the musical’s 
run, when she found she was pregnant and had to leave the show. Her 
baby, born prematurely, did not survive.

In
 1957, pregnant again, she had to leave another West End show only to 
lose a second premature baby who died after a few days. Dora and Bill, 
despairing of ever having a child of their own, adopted a son, Daniel, 
and a daughter, Georgina.

Then,
 in 1962, in the wake of her award-winning performance in A Taste Of 
Honey, came wonderful news: Dora found she was pregnant again. The 
Lawtons’ son William  was born healthy.

But the following Christmas, Dora lost a third baby. Triumph never came without its tragedy, and as the family mourned the loss, her hit single All I Want For Christmas Is A Beatle shot into the top 20 in the music charts.

No matter what she faced, she remained determined. She survived a terrifying car accident in Spain from which she emerged with six broken ribs, a broken collar bone and a broken shoulder blade, and later underwent six weeks of electro-convulsive therapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous to conquer her addiction to booze.

Still Dora battled on. She delighted film audiences as a headmistress in The Great St Trinian’s Train Robbery and in Carry On Sergeant, and on telly in Dinner Ladies and Absolutely Fabulous. Her last major role was as a recurring character in Last Of The Summer Wine.

She was all smiles and bonhomie on screen but at home she was looking after Bill, who had developed Alzheimer’s. They had been married for 54 rapturous years when he died at 88.

Then came the most heartbreaking blow – she too began to show signs of memory loss and dementia.

BBC executives were alarmed to see Dora, during a break in filming, trying to use a TV remote control to make a mobile phone call. In 2005, her role in Last Of The Summer Wine came to an end. The final curtain had fallen on a glorious career.

Last year, she made her last public appearance at an exhibition devoted to her career at Rottingdean Museum in East Sussex. Dora, a trouper to the last, turned and said: ‘Bye-bye, darlings, I’ve got to go. I have a show to do.’ For the unforgettable Queen of Laughter the lure of the stage lights never faded.
