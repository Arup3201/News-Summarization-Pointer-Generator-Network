Vomit cupcakes with a slice of sideboob and a spew cocktail?

The sight of the menu would make most stomachs turn, but do not judge a cake by its icing as that is exactly what they are.

A repulsive line of disgusting-looking deliciousness is going on show at a pop-up shop in east London to launch a DVD of – what else – a horror film.

Throw-upcake: Lemon-drizzle cupcakes decorated to perfection and then covered in vomit is set to go on display

The creepy creations have been made by
some of the UK's finest delicacy artists to mark the release of The 
Helpers DVD, due to hit the shelves next week.

The brains behind the 
little pop-up-shop of horror is ‘freelance creative director‘ Miss 
Cakehead, who brought London the first 18+ cupcake shop and hit the 
headlines with the macabre ‘human butchery shop’ which fashioned meat 
into body parts.

This time Miss Cakehead, real name 
Emma Thomas, has teamed up with food artists and master mixologists to 
put even the toughest of stomachs to the test.

Invitees will be able to tuck in to 
the gory medley which include a severed stomach cake, screaming 
chocolate baby heads and vomit cocktails.

A side of sideboob? A breast complete with a nipple piercing and protruding chest bones was on the menu

H-armful drinking: It takes a strong stomach - and liver - to brave the cocktail menu, served inside a human arm

Tasty torture: Chocolate rope is wrapped around this marzipan hand, oozing raspberry blood all over the table

Jelly belly: Flesh cake made to look like a woman's stomach will be on offer tonight

Miss Cakehead said: ‘Without question 
this is one of the most horrific edible projects ever created and it's 
going to be truly fascinating to see if people can stomach eating the 
delicious cakes and treats.’

In a previous interview with The Independent Miss Cakehead said is it impossible to create an offensive cake.

'The gory look is offset by the deliciousness of the cake.

‘I once had a cake woman made, she was
in a bath with her throat cut, and I called it “Bitch in a Bloodbath" -
everyone loved it.'

Cadaver cake: A first glance at this severed head would make anyone jump, but nibble at her nose and you will discover that it is made from sponge

Co- organiser Koch Media Said: ‘The 
Helpers is a gory treat for horror fans, and this installation will 
certainly push the boundaries of what people can handle.

‘The edible creations mirror moments 
from The Helpers, such as the horrific bathtub scene, so members of the 
public can become truly immersed in the film.’

Handy: The marzipan hand wrapped in chocolate rope in full view - and it was even given a manicure

Fine cut: The cake knife takes a slice of a piece of wounded flesh

Buzzing bake: An edible battery next to a bathtub full of 'blood cocktail'
