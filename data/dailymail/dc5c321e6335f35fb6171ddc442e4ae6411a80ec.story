An entire family of small frogs found on the coast of South America is thought to have been wiped out by a deadly amphibian disease. 

The Darwin's frog, and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog, have not been spotted for months and scientists from Chile and Britain believe they are now extinct. 

The disease is called chytridiomycosis and the claims have been made by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Universidad Andris Bello (UNAB).

Darwin's frog and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog are both named after 
naturalist and evolutionist Charles Darwin.

As its name suggests, the Chile Darwin's frog is endemic to Chile, while its cousin was also found in Argentina.

Darwin first discovered the Rhinodermatidae darwinii species in 1834 in south Chile 
during his voyage around the globe.

The species have a distinct appearance, having evolved to look like a leaf, with a pointy nose.

Darwin's frogs are small, reaching a size of only 3cm in length.

Professor Andrew Cunningham from ZSL's Institute of Zoology said: ‘Only a few examples of the 'extinction by infection' phenomenon exist.

‘Although not entirely conclusive, the possibility of chytridiomycosis being associated with the extinction of the northern Darwin's frog gains further support with this study.’

The scientists claim the plummeting numbers and the disappearance of the creatures from most of their territory across Chile and Argentina cannot be explained by habitat loss alone.

Hundreds of specimens of Darwin's frogs and other amphibians from similar habitats were collected between 1835 and 1989.

Each were tested in order to find DNA pieces of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungus that causes the disease chytridiomycosis.

In addition, 26 populations of Darwin's frogs were surveyed in Chile and Argentina between 2008 and 2012 for the presence of Bd.

Research leader Dr. Claudio 
Soto-Azat, from UNAB and former ZSL PhD student said: ‘Amphibians have 
inhabited the earth for 365 million years, far longer than mammals.

‘We may have already lost one species, the northern Darwin's frog, but we cannot risk losing the other one. There is still time to protect this incredible species.

‘Amphibians provide an important ecosystem service by maintaining balance in the environment.

Without them insect plagues and their subsequent effect on agriculture and public health would be more frequent.

‘ZSL scientists are working to further understand the reasons behind the extinction of Darwin's frogs, and ensure the long-term survival of the species.’

It's thought a disease called chytridiomycosis has wiped them out

One of the last known sightings of the small frog was in January 2013
