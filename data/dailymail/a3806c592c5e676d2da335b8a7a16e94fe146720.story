This is the jaw-dropping moment a young boy achieved what appears to be the world's longest basketball shot.

But rather than doing it from on the ground, the Finnish youngster hit his target from 230 feet (70 metres) up in the air.

The astonishing video was filmed at a ski jump tower in Lahti, Finland.

Easy peasy: The Finnish boy, dressed casually in a hooded jacket, prepares to take his ambitious shot

Vertiginous height: The ski jump tower at Lahti, in Finland, is an immense 230 feet (70 metres) up in the air

Space jam: The description under the video claims the sensational shot has broken the world record for the longest drop of a basketball

Lucky it's orange! The ball becomes increasingly difficult to see as it drops from the incredible height

A boy dressed in a checked, hooded jacket is seen gently dropping the ball over the edge of the tower and into a forest of trees.

Amazingly, his shot goes into the basket far below, and he shouts and bangs the side of his tower in delight.

The boys made 19 attempts at their stunt before getting it right on the 20th try.

'This video is gonna be a hit,' writes one YouTube user.

The brief description beneath the video, posted on Saturday but thought to have been filmed two years ago, stresses that the shot beats the record set by How Ridiculous - an Australian foursome who sank a shot from 219.5ft (66.89m) up at Perth's Western Australian Cricket Ground.

The Guinness world record for the 
longest successful basketball shot is 104ft 7in (31.9m), set by Elan 
Buller at Campbell Hall Elementary School in North Hollywood, 
California.

Breathtaking: The ball fades from view over the dense Finnish forest in the display of stunning skill

Sheer genius: After a substantial pause, the pinprick grows larger as the ball speeds towards the basket

Overjoyed: The unnamed boy shouts and bangs the tower's wall as he achieves the remarkable shot

Other basketball records include the 
most free throws in one minute - 39, by Ashley Graham (USA) at Tualatin 
Hills Athletic Center in Beaverton, Oregon.

How Ridiculous have lobbed balls off the top of all sorts of high structures in Perth, as well as performing bizarre stunts in the gym and on the football field.

Their exploits include using exercise balls to bounce the ball into the net and kicking a ball over a bar and into a basket in an extremely tough-looking trick.

They have also made videos of themselves catching a Frisbee while jumping off a speedboat and getting a hole-in-one on a golf course - with a throw.

Exceptional: The lone boy appears to have beaten the official record set by an Australian group who perform crazy sporting stunts all year round

Perhaps the most bizarre clips show them hitting an egg with a boomerang and knocking an ice cream out of someone's hand.

Now it appears that one of their craziest sporting stunts has been beaten by a very talented child.

A spokesman for Guinness World Records said: '[There] is an existing record for the greatest height from which a basketball has been shot. The measurement was 66.89 m by Kyle Nebel of How Ridiculous in Perth, Australia, on 8 April 2011.

'Nebel and three teammates from the How Ridiculous team of basketball trick shot artists spent more than two-and-a-half hours attempting shots from the top of a light tower at the WACA ground.

'The Finnish claim remains unverified.Â  We look forward to receiving their evidence so we can investigate.'
