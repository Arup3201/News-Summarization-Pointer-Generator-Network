A judge has granted a two-month trial delay for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , but denied a defense request to move his trial.

Judge George O'Toole ruled on Wednesday night that the trial will begin January 5 instead of November 3.

He said there's no reason to assume before the trial that a fair jury cannot be found in Massachusetts.

Faces the death penalty: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will begin trial in Boston on January 5 instead of November 3 as previously planned and may face the death penalty if convicted 

Defense wanted to move trial: The suspect's defense requested to move the trial from Boston for fear that media coverage of the bombings (pictured) would prevent fair trial

Defense attorneys had asked to have the trial moved to Washington, D.C., and delayed until at least September 2015.

Prosecutors say 21-year-old Tsarnaev and his now-deceased older brother placed two pressure cooker bombs that exploded near the marathon's finish line last year.

Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured.

Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if convicted.

MBTA Officer Richard Donahue who almost bled to death in an April 19th firefight that killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the accused killer's older brother, told The Boston Herald he is relieved that the trial will begin soon.

'A burden has been lifted off all of us,' Donohue said. 'It’s important to kick it off.'

The Tsaraevs also allegedly murdered a 26-year-old MIT officer Sean Collier on April 19.

They are also accused of killing Martin Richard, 8, Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29, three days earlier during the bombings on Boylston Street.

A ballroom dancer who last her left foot during the bombings, Adrianne Haslet-Davis, told the Boston Herald she's 'happy' the trial won't ruin the holidays for survivors and victims' families.

Trial will stay in Boston: Keeping the trial in Boston will allow survivors and families of the victims of the horrible Boston Marathon bombing (pictured) stay close to hope and among their support groups

She said that keeping the trial in Boston will give families 'solace.'

'The trial is where it should be. He needs to face his own death sentence where he was stupid enough to pull off what he did,' she said.

'I’m happy survivors can sleep in their own beds and be close to their support units,' she added.

She also had something to say about Tsarnaev's right, or lack therof to decide where his trial will be held.

'He shouldn’t have any say in where the trial is,' she said.

'He’s fortunate enough to have people around him and to be able to fight for his life, because not all of us had that luxury.'

'This is what’s best for the people with PTSD who have to face this trial,' Haslet-Davis added.

'I’m glad none of us will have Thanksgiving in the courtroom. I’m glad the trial, and he, won’t be ruining the holidays.'
