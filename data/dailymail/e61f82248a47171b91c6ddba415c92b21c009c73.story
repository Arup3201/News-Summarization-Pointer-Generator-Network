A real-life Trotter family – who even drove around in a yellow three-wheel van – have been ordered to pay back more than £200,000 they made from their dodgy dealings.

Trevor Wales, 56, and his son Richard, 30, the Del Boy and Rodney of the operation, sold contraband tobacco and cigarettes in a six-year scam.

They evaded more than £200,000 in duty on the sales and used the proceeds to buy property, jet skis, luxury cars, caravans and motorbikes.

Rusting: The Reliant Robin even had the words 'Trotters Independent Traders' sprawled on the side

Some of the cash went on a replica of the famous yellow Reliant Regal 
Supervan three-wheeler used by slippery cockney Del Boy Trotter in the 
comedy series Only Fools And Horses.

The vehicle even bore the logo Trotters Independent Traders.

Unlike
the fictional Del Boy and his younger brother Rodney, the father and 
son make a fortune from their crime – and unlike the Trotters, they went
to prison.

When police went to the house of Trevor Wales and his 
wife Mary in Leeds to arrest them, she stuffed more than £5,000 in the 
knickers she was wearing, only for it to fall out in front of officers.

In
another room, police found £16,000 in £1,000 bundles. At the time of 
their arrest, Trevor and Mary Wales had a legitimate income of only 
£7,400 a year.

But they had managed to build a two-storey extension 
to the house and installed a luxury kitchen and gym.

They had £144,000 
in bank accounts even after Mary Wales had gambled away £47,000 in a 
casino. In 2011, Trevor Wales was jailed for two years and three months 
and Richard Wales for 15 months.

Mary Wales, 55, who acted as the banker for the operation, escaped with a suspended sentence.

Between
them the three admitted charges including evading VAT on tobacco and 
converting criminal property. This week, the jail sentences having been 
served, they were back at Leeds Crown Court for a proceeds of crime 
hearing to decide how much they must pay back.

Trevor Wales was ordered to repay £71,469 and his son £21,029.

Mary
Wales – who, the court heard, made most from the counterfeit cigarette 
scam – was ordered to repay £110,747. All three must pay up within six 
months or face jail.

An order was also made for the forfeiture and 
destruction of contraband tobacco seized by police. Judge Tom Bayliss QC
said the defendants had ‘benefited from criminal conduct’.
