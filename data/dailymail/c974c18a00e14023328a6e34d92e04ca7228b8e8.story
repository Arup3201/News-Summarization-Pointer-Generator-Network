It has been a year of firsts for luxury accessories brand Symthson in their 126-year history. They unveiled a new flagship store in London in February and then last month opened their first store in Asia.

Now the British brand have announced they will join London Fashion Week for the first time by hosting an event on Sunday, 15 September.

A Smythson spokesperson told Vogue that 'the outing will celebrate the brand's key bag of the season - the Panama - a tote designed in both red and blue'.

Expanding: The Hong Kong store is the brand's first standalone shop in Asia

Credit for the brand's expansion can partly be attributed to the effect of Samantha Cameron, their former creative director who has since become a global ambassador for the brand in her role as Britain's 'first lady'.

The 40-year-old stepped down from her job in 2010 when her husband became Prime Minister and she was pregnant with daughter, Florence.

But she has remained involved with the company as a creative consultant and last month cut the ribbon to officially open their stand-alone store in Hong Kong.

While she was there, she told the South China Morning Post she's delighted at how the brand has evolved over the years.

She said: 'I joined (Smythson) around 1996. I've 
always been a fan of the brand so it was great to go in and 'have a 
fiddle'. I think it's been great but it's been an 
evolution rather than a revolution.'

Symthson was founded by Frank Symthson in 1887 specialising in luxury leather stationary, diaries and bags.

Mrs Cameron said the company have worked hard to stay true to Mr Symthson's vision while also moving the collections forward with modern touches.

She said: 'When I arrived, we honed the aesthetic. We did a lot with colour and certainly expanded the women's products, relaunching handbags, as they'd always been a strong part of [founder] Frank Smythson's original collection. I went very much back into the archives.'

She added that under the guidance of chief executive Andy Janowski, 'everything we've done is think about what's relevant today, both in the aesthetics and practicality, and what's going to be relevant tomorrow.'

As well as travelling to Hong Kong for the recent store opening, Mrs Cameron was also involved in the unveiling of the new London store in Sloane Street in February as she hosted a tea party as part of their official celebrations.

So it's likely she will also make a personal appearance at their London Fashion Week outing.

Mrs Cameron is keen to play down her own part in the brand's resurgence pointing instead to it being due to the 'cool Britannia' vibe spreading globally thanks to the royal wedding, Queen's jubilee and London Olympics.

She said: 'Its been fantastic that Britain has been (experiencing this). Whether it's the royal wedding, or the Olympics, or our fantastic fashion designers, its great to be part of that.'
