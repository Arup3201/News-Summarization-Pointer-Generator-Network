A Chinese shipping company is to be prosecuted over the death of a British survivor of the 9/11 attacks who fell down a lift shaft on a vessel during its maiden voyage.

Courtenay Allan plunged 60ft from the bridge of the container ship when he stepped through elevator doors that had opened before the lift car had arrived.

The businessman’s three sons have been campaigning since the tragedy in 2003 for action to be taken against the ship’s Hong Kong-based owners, Orient Overseas Container Line.

One of Mr Allan’s sons, Hayden, is an adviser to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and a former head of press for the Tory Party.

The accident happened while the OOCL Montreal was in the French port of Le Havre.

Mr Allan, 53, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, was a senior executive with the company and was at an on-board reception for European clients and dignitaries.

Now French authorities have decided there is sufficient evidence to bring charges of involuntary manslaughter against the shipping firm.

An inquest into Mr Allan’s death was held in Chelmsford last year.

The coroner said it may have been caused by ‘direct human intervention by way of modification to the lift system’.

Mr Allan’s eldest son Ben said investigations had shown there had been ‘tampering’ with the lift system and added: ‘We hope a full court trial next year will finally hold OOCL responsible for our father’s death.’

A company statement said: ‘We will fully co-operate with any action required by the relevant authorities.’

In 2001 Mr Allan escaped uninjured when hijacked planes slammed into the World Trade Center as he walked across the plaza between the Twin Towers.
