TIGER LETS IT SLIP

It wasn’t just shots Tiger Woods was dropping as he let a big F-bomb go at the second — swearing loud enough for broadcasters to pick it up after another rotten drive. But Bubba Watson was in trouble for keeping quiet as the big-hitter failed to shout fore after a wayward shot at the same hole.

BUTT OF THE JOKE 

It is tradition for the previous year’s winner to choose the menu for the Champions Dinner. Holder Jason Dufner’s menu included a ‘Butt Rubbed’ Filet Mignon — Butt Rub being a barbecue seasoning. The choice was presumably inspired by last year’s celebration, during which he was photographed patting his wife’s rear end.

MONTY’S BUSY DAY

Colin Montgomerie took time off from his commentating duties with Sky to shoot a highly respectable 70. But after a quick shower it was straight into the studio for Monty, 51, who said: ‘I wanted to represent the Champions Tour well and 70 is OK to start with. I drove the ball well and knew if I did that I could get round.’

IT’S SANTA CLARKE!

Lee Westwood was all smiles and he had plenty to ‘ho, ho, ho’ about after making Darren Clarke dress like Santa for the first round. 

Clarke lost Dunlop's par-three challenge to his pal over the first three majors of the year and the forfeit was that he had to wear a outfit selected by Westwood — hence Clarke sporting grey beard, white top and red trousers.

FOWLER A MAJOR FORCE

He may be ranked 18 in the world, but Rickie Fowler’s form in majors this year reads tied fifth, tied second and tied second. 

Fowler had an excellent start yesterday with a 69 and if he holds his place until Sunday, he would be the first to finish in the top five of all four majors in a year since Tiger Woods in 2005.

Eye on the price: Rickie Fowler looks set to challenge at a major again

CROWD PLEASER WATSON

Tiger had them growling and there were plenty of roars for Rory but one of the warmest welcomes from the gallery was for Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson at the first hole. 

The 64-year-old, whose best finish in the US PGA was second in 1978, responded by splitting the fairway with his drive — which led to even greater cheers.
