Doritos are playing with fire with their new limited edition of Roulette chips set to have tongues burning as well as wagging in Australia.

The hottest chip ever created by the brand was launched in Australia on Monday and will hit supermarket shelves next week. 

Most of the chips in each packet are Doritos’ classic Cheese Supreme flavour, but hidden in every handful is one very hot chip.

A pleasant night in with some friends soon takes a turn for the worse thanks to the spicy treat

It’ll then be a game of chip roulette for whoever takes into a bag. Australia will be only the third country in the world to try out the new taste sensation after Canada and South Africa, even beating the United States to the crunch.

The move has actually caused a huge reaction in the US who are desperate to be the next country to get in on the act, even sparking an online petition to have the new type of chips there.

I surrender: another challenger can't take anymore and fails the roulette challenge 

Known as ‘anxiety in a bag’ many unsuspecting victims didn’t know what hit them. Reactions to Doritos Roulette have been well-documented on YouTube by unsuspecting Canadian and South African snackers overseas.

Some have called the chips ‘dangerous’ and comparing the experience to ‘a solid slap in the face’.

‘They all look the same, so the challenge is you never know what you’re going to get. The fun comes from sharing them with mates and waiting for the reaction on their faces,’ a Doritos spokeswoman said.

‘That’ll be the biggest laugh of all – seeing people’s reactions when they bite into the hot chip.’

The Doritos Roulette chip comes with a warning on the bag that ‘some of these chips are mega spicy’, the mysterious hot chips rack up a scorching 7,360 Scoville Heat Units.

This puts them higher on the scientific scale of spicy food than jalapeno and chipotle chilies. Spice experts have compared the experience to taking a shot of hot sauce.

It’s bound to get a hot reaction one way or another. 

You can try and laugh it off but once you get that burning sensation it's game over
