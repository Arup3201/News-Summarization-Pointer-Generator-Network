Were Tottenham right to part with boss Sherwood?

In the end, Tim Sherwood's showdown with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and director of football administration Darren Eales went just as they had predicted. The manager went out swinging.

Sherwood had known since a meeting with Levy on April 7 that he was a dead man walking and he did not hold back in a full and frank exchange of opinions during Tuesday’s early-morning meeting at the training ground.

Levy retaliated and it is his belief that every time Sherwood talked during his seven-month spell in charge at Spurs, he slit his own throat. On Tuesday, Levy and Eales finished him off.

Man in charge: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy informed Sherwood of his decision in a meeting on Tuesday

Tottenham’s chairman told Sherwood he was too unpredictable, with coded messages to the board and warnings to players littering his press conferences. Often they were spell-binding to listen to, a refreshing change of pace amid the guff often trotted out by managers in the Barclays Premier League. But Sherwood went too far.

The former Spurs midfielder was told on Tuesday his behaviour was not becoming of a manager at a club with Tottenham’s traditions and history. Sherwood maintained he was just being honest.

Levy, though, believed it was only a matter of time before Sherwood broke the golden rule at White Hart Lane by bad-mouthing him or owner Joe Lewis in public.

Cross them and you are fired: just ask Martin Jol, Harry Redknapp and Andre Villas-Boas. This is one of the most prestigious jobs in football, but the consequences of falling out of line are always brutal. Sherwood knows that now.

This was his chance to prove he could stand alongside men of stature such as Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. Instead, he talked himself out of the job. It’s a long road back.

After Tottenham’s 4-0 defeat at Chelsea on March 8, when the team had been reduced to 10 men, Sherwood claimed: ‘I know the players I can trust and those I can’t.’ The boardroom winced.

Then, after the 4-0 defeat at Liverpool on March 30, Levy almost had to call in the United Nations after Sherwood clashed with former Tottenham boss Glenn Hoddle. The pair have history.

In December, Levy had afforded Hoddle, sacked by Spurs in 2003 following a calamitous run of results, the courtesy of an interview for the manager’s job. He was never going to be appointed.

Sherwood, aware of this, reacted badly when Hoddle, who is a regular visitor to the Spurs boardroom on matchdays, criticised his players for their approach at Anfield.

Hoddle’s observations about them leaning against the wall outside the dressing room before kick-off were correct. Sherwood was livid.

‘Glenn’s got a lot of opinion and he’s also got a lot of opinion about Tottenham, and he’s entitled to that,’ claimed Sherwood. ‘It’s been a long time since Glenn Hoddle’s managed a football team and the game has moved on significantly.’

Back in Hoddle’s day, when he attempted to freeze Sherwood out of the first team, the midfielder ambushed a board meeting over it. He has always been strong-willed.

Nothing changed after Levy agreed to make him the manager on an 18-month contract following the dismissal of Villas-Boas.

With a few decent results behind him against teams outside the top four, he maintained the club did not need to recruit players in January. Levy was happy with this.

Then, after Spurs lost 1-0 to Arsenal at White Hart Lane — their third defeat by Wenger’s side this  season — Sherwood insisted he could ‘only play the hand I’ve been dealt’.

Mediocre: Spurs finished sixth in the Premier League after Sherwood won 14 of his 28 games in charge

Honest: Sherwood believes Tottenham would've challenged for the top four had they not sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid last summer

28 games as Tottenham manager (14 wins, four draws, 10 losses)

1 gilet worn

47 goals scored  during his  reign at Spurs

42 Premier League points earned (13 wins, three draws and six losses)

2 Premier League debuts from  Spurs academy players (Alex  Pritchard, 21, and Milos Veljkovic, 18)

47 Goals condceded

1 win in a cup competition (3-1) v Dnipro, February 27

141 days in charge

By then, Levy was keeping a low profile after conceding that he and director of football Franco Baldini had brought in too many players last summer. They were too hasty to rebuild after Gareth Bale’s move to Real Madrid.

Still, Sherwood had his own aggressive transfer plans in place for the summer as he prepared for his first full season.

There were proposals to bring in West Ham defender Winston Reid, Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry and striker Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea. Sherwood was convinced he could sign all three.

He believed they would make the team competitive but Levy told Sherwood at their April 7 meeting that he was preparing to make yet another change. ‘You know I like experience,’ Levy told him.

Sixth: Sherwood's last game was a 3-0 win over Aston Villa, which secured Spurs Europa League football

On Tuesday the chairman added: ‘Since 
appointing Tim as assistant first-team coach in 2008 and then as 
technical co-ordinator in 2010 and head of football development in 2012,
 we have been supportive of him during management changes. I should like
 to state our thanks for all his efforts during his years with us. We 
wish him great success in his managerial career.

‘Now the season is over, we shall embark on the process of finding a new head coach. We have a talented squad and exciting players coming through. We need to build on this season, develop our potential and inspire the kind of performances we associate with our great club.’

As for Sherwood, he is disappointed but determined to return as a Premier League manager.

MARCH 8 (Following a 4-0 defeat at Chelsea)

There’s a lack of characters. Too many of them are too nice to each other. We need to show a bit more guts and not want to be someone’s mate all the time.

MARCH 12 (Reflecting on his comments at Chelsea)

They are all men, they all appreciate that I am singing it from the heart, not from the script. I’m not an actor, I work on impulse. I’m just going to shoot from the hip. I’m a manager, not a babysitter.

APRIL 17 (On Gareth Bale’s move to Real Madrid)

Give me Gareth Bale and I think we might have been realistic challengers for the top four. His fee looks cheap now.

MAY 9 (Summing up his  feelings two days before the final game against Aston Villa)

If you have a supply teacher who comes into your school, sometimes they’re not  treated with the respect that a headmaster is.

If I need information on my future I’m better off asking the players. I’m not sure if the chairman has spoken to Sandro but obviously someone has told him. I have had a lot of players come to me and say their agents have told them that I’m not going to be here next year. It is a very difficult situation but I have got to get on with it.
