It is probably one of the most peculiar aspects of human biology - that females of a certain age lose the ability to reproduce.

Now scientists have discovered that killer whales - a species separated from humans by almost 94 million years of evolution - also suffer from the menopause and it could provide clues as to why it evolved in the first place.

There is just one other species in the wild known to undergo the menopause - short-finned pilot whales - although it has been observed in a handful of captive primates and animals.

Older female killer whales tend to take the lead (like the one above) when families are foraging for food

The evolution of a trait that reduces the reproductive capability of a species has long baffled biologists and there are a number of theories for why it emerged in humans.

Now a team of researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of York may have unraveled the reason for the menopause - in killer whales at least.

It happens to every woman who reaches a certain age, but in the animal kingdom, the menopause is a relatively uncommon trait.

Humans can live long after they stop being able to reproduce, but most animals tend to remain fertile up until they die.

A few species of primate, like rhesus monkeys, orangutans and chimpanzees are also known to experience menopause while it has also been reported in elephants and short-finned pilot whales.

Laboratory rats, captive opossums and budgerigars have also been observed to under go the menopause.

However, the short-finned pilot whale and the killer whale are the only animals that been been seen to live long past the age that they lose the ability to reproduce. 

They have found that it frees up the older, more experienced females to lead their families in the search for food and so boost the ability of the entire group to survive.

The findings may now also help to explain why the menopause emerged in human populations - it allowed older women to impart their knowledge and help care for the younger members.

Professor Darren Croft, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Exeter, said: 'In humans, it has been suggested that menopause is simply an artifact of modern medicine and improved living conditions.

'However, mounting evidence suggests that menopause in humans is adaptive.

'In hunter-gatherers, one way that menopausal women help their relatives, and thus increase the transmission of their own genes, is by sharing food.

'Menopausal women may also have shared another key commodity - information.'

The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Current Biology, studied groups of killer whales in the wild off the coast of British Columbia and Washington during nine summer salmon migrations.

Female killer whales can continue having calves, like above, until around the age of 35 years old say scientists

In total they observed 102 whales - 58 of which were female - and studied which of the whales occupied the lead position as the whales hunted for the salmon.

They also used 35 years worth of data on the whale population in the area to identify those that had gone through the menopause.

On average female killer whales older than 35 years old were found to have gone through the menopause.

The researchers found that the older post-reproductive females tended to lead groups of the whales when they were foraging for salmon.

Orca are one of just two species that are known to undergo the menopause in the wild other than humans

They were also more likely to take the lead in years when the salmon abundance was low - meaning the killer whales were struggling to find food.

This is because the older females are using their greater experience to help the group find food, say the researchers.

Dr Lauren Brent, a behavioural biologist at the University of Exeter who was the lead author of the research, said: Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge.

'The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing.

The researchers also found that post-menopausal killer whales were also more likely to lead their sons than their daughters.

Dr Daniel Franks, from the University of York, said: 'Killer whale mothers direct more help toward sons than daughters because sons offer greater potential benefits for her to pass on her genes.

'Sons have a higher reproductive potential and they mate outside the group, thus their offspring are born into another gruop and do not compete for resources within the mother's matriline.'
