If you have ever 
wondered how a two-year-old might feel about, say, breakfast, or the 
'time out' method of discipline, then you have not yet discovered Honest
Toddler.

The sharp-tongued
tot, who will not reveal their identity, has earned a huge following on
Twitter thanks to musings on Mommy's Pinterest recipes, getting lost in
the Ikea kitchen department and potty training.

Now, in an exclusive interview,  Honest Toddler reveals diet and fashion tips, as well as the secrets to success.

Lifestyle tips: Honest Toddler has shared advice on diet, fashion and getting your own way

'Know when to say "no",' HT tells MailOnline. 'If you're not sure say it anyway.'

In
terms of style, HT has some sage advice: 'Don't be peer pressured into 
wearing unnecessary items like hats or pants or shoes. Like Russell 
Simmons says, "Do you."'

A good fit is also essential, and skinny denim is a serious no-no.

'Never wear jeans so tight you can't 
put several smooths rocks inside your pockets. The road to hipsterdom is
paved with bad decisions at Baby Gap,' HT warns.

'Don't be peer pressured into wearing unnecessary items like hats or pants or shoes. Like Russell Simmons says, "Do you"'

'Stay
vigilant. Get naked. Also, if you weren't even conceived when a band 
was playing don't wear their toddler-sized T-shirts because it makes you
a liar.'

Diet is another 
subject important to HT. Twitter informs us of a love of chocolate (no 
matter where it may have been found) and cookies - especially if they 
come from Grandma, however the scope is (slightly) broader, so take 
heed, Mommy.

'[I eat] refined carbohydrates (no brown rice) and milk. I enjoy bananas with the strings removed or burned off,' HT says.

'Exercise is
important to me which is why I try not to ever stop moving. Yesterday I
popped and locked in a grocery store check-out line for five full 
minutes. A sign broke. It might be on YouTube I dunno.'

Of course a degree of downtime is key, 
and when one is absolutely forced to go to bed, stories do make the 
process easier to handle. HT's current book of choice is If You Give a 
Mouse A Cookie, apparently 'a story about greed and enabling rodents to 
obesity'.

Why one should be expected to sleep all night long is beyond HT though.

'I've
always been (in)famous in my family on account of me causing the most 
problems at night due to repeated small requests. A trophy ceremony has 
not been formally arranged but I can feel one on the horizon. Fingers 
crossed. :)'

Honest Toddler, which also exists as a blog and Facebook page with a 46,000-strong fan-base, is described as: 'Not potty trained. Not trying.'

General mischief is a popular theme; a tweet yesterday read: 'Breaking glass sounds like applause. That can't be an accident.'

Another, posted on Tuesday, said: 'Ripped up some paper money. You should see her face.'

Regular readers of the posts have 
become familiar with themes, such as Mommy's penchant for childrenswear 
purchased on Etsy and recipes found on Pinterest.

Neither, as one can imagine, have been well-received.

'Pinterest recipes should include instructions on how to break the news to your family,' HT writes.

'Pizza with cauliflower crust for 
dinner Jesus take the wheel... Mommy's Pinterest abomination came out of
the oven smelling like lies.'

Use of Twitter terminology such as retweets, hashtags and 'Follow Friday' is also used to great effect.

'RT if you're awake before five and hoping for pancakes,' reads one.

Another
suggests: '#FF Daddy. You were born a tattle but I forgive you. See me 
later about some chocolate I found. I think it's chocolate.'

Even
current events come into play, such as the scandal surrounding the 
publication of photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing 
topless.

'Revealing photos of me are all over Facebook and Instagram so I know how Kate Middleton feels right now,' he comments.

Last month it emerged that Honest Toddler had signed a book deal with Simon & Schuster in the U.S., HarperCollins Canada and Orion UK.

The
news was revealed via Twitter with HT informing followers: 'Mamaâ€™s 
drinking celebration wine during daylight hours. Said something about a 
book deal and name brand cereal from now on.'
