At the surface Michele Ballarin may look like a thoroughbred socialite, but according to a new interview, she holds so much influence in Somalia that many of the country’s notorious pirates refer to her as ‘amira’, or ‘princess’ in Arabic.

In the latest Washington Post magazine, Ballarin, a 58-year-old hailing from Virginia, says that her humanitarian efforts to eradicate piracy in Somalia have earned her a large fan base in the country.

A senior U.S. government official once even went on-the-record to say that Ballarin ‘has more sway in Somalia than the whole U.S. Government.’

She has now embarked on a new 
humanitarian venture with Somalia’s former president Sheikh Sharif 
Sheikh Ahmed to help provide housing for the country’s large population 
of refugees.

Ballarin says 
that she is known to negotiate with Somalia’s notorious pirates, and 
that she has had a ‘behind the scenes’ hand in organizing the release of
pirate hostages.

She also 
says that she has carried out peaceful conversations with all walks of 
Somali life as part of her work, including pirates and members of the Al-Shabab group, the terrorist organization responsible for last month’s
brutal attacks on a Nairobi mall.

'When I was in the 
north...there was close to 80,000 people trying to get to 
me. They call me the “Mother of Somalia"'

She
says she is not afraid of these more feared sects of Somali society. 
‘They would have a tsunami on their hands,’ Ballarin said of what would 
happen if she were injured by a Somali fringe group. ‘When I was in the 
north at one point, there was close to 80,000 people trying to get to 
me. They call me the “Mother of Somalia”…there would be terrible 
repercussions.’

But despite her pull within Somali society, Ballarin has apparently never worked for the U.S. Government.

In
2007, she sent an ‘unsolicited letter’ to the CIA offering her services
in tracking down Al Qaeda networks in Africa. The bureau sent her a 
letter back saying that they were ‘not interested’ in her services and 
did not authorize her to carry out her terrorist-finding mission on its 
behalf.

But Ballarin was 
undeterred. According to the paper, she sought solace at the Pentagon 
the following year—an effort that was rewarded with a classified 
contract for an undisclosed amount of money. Within a year, the 
contract was reportedly terminated for ‘nonperformance.’

Esther
Hebert, who has worked with Ballarin, told The Washington Post: ‘She has an 
amazing ability to attract very powerful people. Then it all falls 
apart.’

‘I was known as the Coco Chanel in the children’s industry’

Ballarin had many careers before focusing her 
attentions on Somalia, the paper says. In 1986 she ran for Congress and lost, a defeat 
that prompted her to design children’s clothes, which she says were sold in 
Macy’s. ‘I was known as the Coco Chanel in the children’s industry,’ she
said of her design career. (Ballarin is also a fashion plate who is 
cited as wearing Armani and Ferragamo clothing in the piece)

Ballarin’s
childrenswear business closed following her first marriage (to a man 35
years her senior). She then took up work as an executive assistant to an 
orthodontist to try and keep her and her son financially afloat.

Her
luck changed with her second marriage to Gino Ballarin, a longtime
maître d’ at New York’s famous 21 Club. The couple 
relocated to the Washington D.C. metro area after their wedding, where Gino worked in a 
similar capacity at the Georgetown Club, while Michele dabbled in 
investment banking.

Her 
foray into finance gave Michele access to a vast array of wealthy 
people. By enlisting what seems to be an acute knack for sociability, she quickly cemented her status as a gala circuit-ing businesswoman
on the D.C. scene.

That 
positioning gave her access to an encounter with an ‘elder Sufi sheik’ 
from Somalia’s prevailing religion. Ballarin became fascinated with the 
Sufi religion, as well as Somali culture as a whole. She soon began 
making goodwill trips to the country and amassed a following of Somali 
constituents who nicknamed her their princess.

Her
sage Somali influence spread, and in 2009 then-President Ahmed named 
her his ‘presidential advisor for Reconstruction and Humanitarian 
Assistance.’ The appointment came at the heat of Somalia’s pirating 
crisis.

In fact, Ballarin 
has already been involved in several Somalia development programs that 
did not work out. Her nation-building program, dubbed the ‘organic 
solution’, included plans for everything from banks to commercial 
airlines. The project dissolved after nine months, with many of its 
investors failing to recoup tens of thousands of dollars, The Washington Post reports.

Another Ballarin company titled Archangel similarly never got off the ground.

But
Ballarin--who provided multiple photo albums to The Washington Post 
writer as proof of her popularity in Somalia in which she was seen 
‘posing with Somali politicians, warlords, clan leaders, and Sufis,’--has
now teamed up with former President Ahmed again.

'The problem with Michele is separating 
fact from fiction. What is real, and what is made up?'

They
have begun work on a housing project for Somali refugees called the 
‘Oasis Foundation for Hope’. Ballarin and Ahmed have already created a 
modular demo with the help of pro-bono contractors, as was the case with
many of her former business ventures.

She
unveiled the modular home to investors and government compatriots in 
August, admitting to The Washington Post that Ahmed had already ‘identified’ $300 
million in project funding.

Geoff
Whiting, a former naval intelligence officer who worked with both 
Ballarin and Hebert, admitted: ‘The problem with Michele is separating 
fact from fiction. What is real, and what is made up?'
