Three high school students were tragically killed in a plane crash Friday in New Mexico.

So far, officials have named 16-year-olds Michael Mahl and Ella Myers as two of the victims who attended Aldo Leopold Charter School. The third high-schooler and pilot have not yet been identified.

It has been revealed that the pilot offered to fly the three students over the area burned in a wildfire last week in the Gila National Forest, north of Silver City.

Victims: Ella Myers and Michael Mahl, both 16, were two of the three students who died in Friday's plane crash. The other student has not been identified

Witnesses saw the plane make an abrupt 180 turn before landing and bursting into flames in a field

The plane was owned by Albuquerque psychiatrist Dr Peter Hochla.

It was when the plane returned around 4pm and was trying to land at Whiskey Creek airport that they ran into trouble.

Witnesses
 say they saw the plane flying upside down before tilting sideways and 
veering 180-degrees before crashing in a field near a trailer park where
 it burst into flames.

'The plane was sputtering, and it just 
went straight down,' witness Robert Huerta told the Silver City Daily 
Press. 'It fell in a vacant lot right south of the trailersâ€¦ (the fire) 
must have shot up 200, 300 feet in the air.'

It has been revealed that the pilot had offered to take the three students out for a ride to see the damage a recent wildfire had caused. Above, Michael Mahl

Forty to 50 emergency responders showed up to battle the flames and evacuate the area, but none of the victims survived.

Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the plane to crash.

Officials
 at Aldo Leopold say the flight was not school sponsored. The three 
student deaths have rocked the small school, which had just a 16 person 
graduating class this year.

'It's a terrible tragedy, just 
unspeakable grief, and the sadness for our community and our school is 
very heavy,' Dave Chandler, with Aldo Leopold Charter School, told KOAT.
 'These (were) wonderful students, fully engaged in their community.'

On Friday evening hundreds gathered at the Grant County Administration Center to remember the four victims.

Talented: Myers was an artist, writer, musician and athlete

Mahl's
 father John Mahl spoke with the Albuquerque Journal about his son, and said he was glad he decided to skip the gym on Friday and treat his son to a meal instead.

Mahl was student council president, had a perfect grade-point average and played guitar, drums, ukulele and mandolin.

'Everyone
 says this about their kids, but this kid, he was remarkable,' John Mahl
 said. 'He was just such a kind, gentle soul. The world is an emptier 
place without him.'

He also took one of the two girls who died in the plane with him to prom.

Fellow
 victim Ella Myers was also gifted, having already written multiple 
novels. She was an athlete, musician and artist as well.
