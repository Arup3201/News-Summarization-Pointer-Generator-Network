It is what every football-mad child has always dreamed of - waking up holding the FA Cup.

Now young Finley Burridge, six, from London, has done it for real and is one of several youngsters who will get the same honour this year.

The FA has decided young fans can have the chance to win a sleepover with the historical silverware, which Finley said 'was amazing'.

In his dreams: Finley Burridge (6) is the first child to win  a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a sleepover with the FA Cup

Youngsters who visit The FA Cup Trophy Tour - which will visit cities across the country - will be chosen at random to win the iconic trophy in their home.

They will be able to go to sleep and wake up with the trophy, which has been lifted by icons of the English game such as Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Steven Gerrard.

The FA’s Sir Trevor Brooking said: 'The FA Cup goes hand-in-hand with some of English football’s greatest moments and it’s a competition that holds such fond memories for fans up and down the country.

Super fan: Finley said it was 'amazing' to have the silverware in his bed and thanked the FA for the honour

Happy days: Other children will get the same chance as Finley in the build up to the first, second, third and fourth round fixtures of the competition

'It’s that sense of occasion and the unexpected that gives The FA Cup such a magical feel.

'The FA Cup is one of the most recognisable pieces of silverware in world sport and we hope that a new wave of football mad youngsters can fall in love with the competition like generations of children before them.'

The unique FA Cup Dreams initiative, which aims to introduce a new generation to the magic of the world’s oldest domestic football competition, kicks-off in Birmingham today, when the first winning child will be announced and The FA Cup trophy delivered to the family home ahead of the games.

The dream: Chelsea's captain John Terry lifts the FA Cup with teammate Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba in May

The best:  Bobby Moore holds the trophy when he won the cup with West Ham in 1964

Legend: Sir Bobby Robson holds the cup aloft in front of the fans after his Ipswich side won the FA Cup in 1978

The tour will then run ahead of first, second, third and fourth round fixtures in the 2012/13 season, starting on November 3.

Under-12s will be given the chance to enter a prize draw as part of The FA Cup Trophy Tour in order to win a sleepover with the trophy.
