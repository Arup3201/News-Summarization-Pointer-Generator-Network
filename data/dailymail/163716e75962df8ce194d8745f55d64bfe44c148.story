A baby who stopped breathing on a flight was saved by quick-thinking passengers who rushed to the rescue.

Two travelers with medical training stepped after the baby turned purple on board on Tuesday.

The mid-air drama caused the U.S. Airways flight to be diverted to Houston for an emergency landing while on its way from Tampa to Phoenix, Arizona.

A passenger said that one medic turned the baby upside down in order to get the child breathing again. Fortunately, the life-saving measures worked and the child became responsive.

One female traveler told FOX10: 'When we heard the baby cryâ€¦ it was a teary moment for everybody.'

The passenger with the baby was taken off the flight and transferred to hospital. There is no updates so far on the baby's condition. 

The diverted plane landed at its final destination in Houston an hour late.

Although many passengers missed connecting flights, they only seemed concerned that the baby had survived. 

MailOnline was awaiting a call from U.S. Airways.

One female passenger on the flight said that travelers became emotional when the baby started crying after medics saved the child's life
