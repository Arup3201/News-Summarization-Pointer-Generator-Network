A European football match was dramatically abandoned last night after a Serbian player ripped down an Albanian flag that was flown over the pitch on a drone, sparking a huge brawl.

The politically-charged Euro 2016 qualifier was halted after defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down the flag - leading to fights between players and officials and havoc in the Partizan Stadium’s stands.

European football governing body Uefa banned Albania fans from attending the clash in Belgrade but elected to allow the two countries to face each other, despite long-standing political tensions.

After a delay of around half an hour, English referee Martin Atkinson abandoned the game, with the score level at 0-0 

And when the Albanian flag - accompanied by a map of Kosovo and the message 'autochthonous', meaning indigenous - appeared above the pitch with a remote-operated drone, chaos soon ensued.

Olsi Rama - the brother of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama - was arrested in the VIP Box on suspicion of instigating the stunt and was allegedly found with a remote, Serbian state television said.

But Albanian Interior Minister Saimir Tahiri said he believed Olsi Rama had left the stadium for the airport, according to details he had from Serbia's interior ministry and Albanian officials in Belgrade.

Asked if he had been arrested on suspicion of organising the drone stunt, Mr Tahiri told Reuters: 'Not to my knowledge. It's speculation.'

Earlier, Radio Television of Serbia said on its official website of Olsi Rama: 'He was arrested on suspicion that he masterminded and executed the incident.'

Bizarrely, the announcer at the stadium played 1998 Cher hit song Believe in an attempt to calm fans during the break, to no avail.

After a delay of around half an hour, English referee Martin Atkinson abandoned the game, with the score at 0-0.

Uefa delegate Harry Been said: 'It is a regretful situation on which we will report; the referee, myself and the security advisor. The circumstances were such that we couldn’t continue the match.

'You all saw what happened and I cannot comment on who is to blame or what to blame. I will submit a report with my colleagues to Uefa and Uefa will decide what will happen further.'

Serbian defender Branislav Ivanović, who plays for Chelsea in the Premier League, said: 'What happened is something we can't comprehend at the moment.

‘All I can say is that we wanted to carry on. We shielded the Albanian players every step of the way in the tunnel. The Albanian team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials.'

Albanian fans had been warned against attending the game between the two Balkan rival nations that have had turbulent relations - mainly over the former ethnic Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo that declared independence in 2008.

Nato waged a 78-day air war in 1999 to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces fighting a two-year counter-insurgency war. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo as independent.

Albanian fans were banned from attending the match between the two Balkan rival nations, due to the turbulent relations between the two. 

These have mainly surrounded the over the former ethnic Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo.

Kosovo declared independence in 2008, but this is not recognised by Serbia.

Nato waged a 78-day air war in 1999 to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces fighting a two-year counter-insurgency war.

Both Serbian and Albanian fans have a long history of violence and racial abuse. In October 2010, the Italy-Serbia European Championship qualifier was disrupted in Genoa by violent Serbia fans. Uefa eventually awarded Italy a 3-0 win.

Last night, the Albanian anthem was loudly jeered by Serbian fans and derogatory chanting was heard throughout the first half. Serbian supporters also threw flares at the pitch.

The drone, clearly visible in the lights of the stadium, made a series of passes above the pitch.

The banner displayed an Albanian flag and a map of so-called ‘Greater Albania’, an area that comprises territory within today's Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and northern Greece.

The banner also portrayed two Albanian nationalist leaders - Ismail Qemali, who declared Albania's independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912 and Isa Boletini, an Albanian fighter against the Turks.

The double-headed eagle, as featured on the Albanian flag, is imposed upon so-called 'Greater Albania' where ethnic Albanians live.

The word 'autochthonous' refers to Serbia's alleged attempts to control Kosovo despite not being indigenous to the region.

Seven of Albania's squad were born in the Kosovo region. 

Fearing trouble, hundreds of riot police were deployed inside and outside the Partizan stadium in Belgrade.

Dozens of Albanian fans, mostly from Kosovo and Montenegro, apparently managed to get inside despite warnings by Serbian security officials that they would be arrested if they carry Albanian symbols.

On his Twitter page, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama congratulated Albanian players for their courage before the match was abandoned and added that he was ‘sorry for the neighbours who left a bad worldwide image with the ugly show’.

Thousands of Albanian fans who followed the match on a big screen in Tirana headed for the airport in the Albanian capital to welcome the players arriving from Belgrade.

After the match, Albanian Interior Minister Mr Tahiri sent a letter to his Serbian counterpart expressing concerns for the security of the Albania players, team staff, journalists and a few fans.

The minister asked for ‘urgent steps to guarantee the security of all Albanian citizens present in the stadium’.
