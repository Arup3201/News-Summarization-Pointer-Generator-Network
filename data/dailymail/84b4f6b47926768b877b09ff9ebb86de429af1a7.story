When footballers surrender the habit of doing even the basics right, you know a team is in trouble. By that rationale, Newcastle United and manager Alan Pardew would appear to be in very deep trouble indeed.

This was not a performance to place alongside the capitulation at Southampton just over a fortnight ago. It may be a while before we see the like of that again.

At times last night Newcastle kept the ball and spent time in Stoke City’s half. They created half-chances. Right at the death, they could even have equalised. How Jack Colback lifted the ball on to the crossbar from only six yards perhaps even he doesn’t know.

MAN OF THE MATCH: Victor Moses

One of the big giveaways when you watch bad teams, though, is how easily they concede possession and what they do when they don’t have the ball. On both those scores, Newcastle were utterly wretched again last night.

Peter Crouch’s winning goal in the first half was a fine header. It happened because Newcastle made weak challenges and showed a lack of commitment in the air.

Subsequently, Stoke capitalised on careless Newcastle passing to break regularly on Tim Krul’s goal. At times forward Victor Moses must have felt he was participating in some kind of training drill.

Speaking on the BBC, pundit Phil Neville summed it up beautifully.

‘Every time Newcastle have a set piece, you feel that Stoke are going to break away and score,’ said Neville.

Had Stoke been more ruthless they would have buried Newcastle, but the fall-out is the same — the visitors stay joint bottom and poor Pardew slips closer to the unemployment line.

How much longer the Newcastle manager’s misery will go on, only owner Mike Ashley can be aware.

What is beyond doubt is that Pardew’s travails are painful to watch. His employer seems not to care for him, his players have forgotten how to play for him and his club’s supporters — or at least a huge portion of them — have had enough of him.

Last night, this result had an air of inevitably about it. So bad had Newcastle been at Southampton that nobody blinked when Crouch headed Stoke into the lead after quarter of an hour.

Newcastle had actually been marginally the better team until then. In an instant, though, Stoke broke to score and the tone of the game was set.

It was a fine goal from Stoke’s point of view. The cross from the left by the lively Moses was a good one and Crouch’s leap was impressive as he headed the ball past Krul from ten yards.

From a Newcastle point of view, though, there was culpability everywhere.

Right back Daryl Janmaat had two opportunities to tackle Moses before the cross arrived but was simply too weak or perhaps lacking in zeal.

When Moses did deliver, Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini utterly failed to compete in the air with Crouch.

The Stoke player was able to rise a good six inches above his marker and that made scoring the goal much simpler.

It was a dreadful moment for Newcastle and one wondered how bad it would get from that point. Indeed, had referee Craig Pawson spotted Yoan Gouffran’s foul on Moses in the penalty area soon after, the contest may have been over by the time the first-half rain had stopped.

Pardew’s team lacks discipline and suffers from lapses in concentration. It is a deadly combination and almost undid them on two or three more occasions before the interval.

Had Stoke made some better decisions of their own they would have profited but the closest they came was when Crouch applied a poor touch to a Moses pass and shot wide. Substitute Marko Arnautovic then drove a low effort against Newcastle defender Paul Dummett. 

At the other end, Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic saved low from Janmaat as half time approached but the other side of the interval brought little change in the overall pattern.

Arnautovic was unfortunate to see a right-foot shot cannon off the far post in the 48th minute while Moses should have done better than allow Krul to block when two Newcastle defenders fell over each other to gift him a chance on the hour.

Stoke’s profligacy subsequently kept Newcastle in the game and Colback could have snatched something when Gabriel Obertan’s cross reached him at the death.

All he could manage, though, was to snatch at the chance and it was typical of Newcastle’s night.

As he left the field, Pardew applauded the Newcastle fans. They did not respond in kind.
