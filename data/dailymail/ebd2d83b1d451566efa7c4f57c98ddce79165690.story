Zlatan Ibrahimovic had hoped to be at the World Cup in Brazil showcasing his skills but instead he is holidaying with his family in New York.

The Swedish striker, who has scored 48 goals in 96 internationals, has been forced to 
sit the summer tournament out after his national side failed to beat 
Portugal in their World Cup play-off last year.

The 32-year-old was pictured sightseeing with his wife Helena Seger, as well as with sons Max and Vincent.

 in the second leg of their play-off with Portugal in Stockholm.

netting a hat-trick to seal a 4-2 aggregate win for Paulo Bento's side.
