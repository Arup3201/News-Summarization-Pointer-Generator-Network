As thoughts were drifting idly towards Thierry Henry, out-of-work superhero twiddling thumbs and pining for Arsenal after leaving New York, up popped Alexis Sanchez with another rescue goal.

Sanchez is scoring at such a prolific rate he would eclipse even Henry in full flow. His late winner was his 14th in his last 18 games for Arsene Wenger’s team and completely transformed the mood of a frustrating night. He is a worthy heir to Henry’s mask and cape.

For 88 minutes, the Emirates Stadium had grumbled and grown increasingly agitated as chances came and went. Many were missed by Daniel Welbeck and supporters chanted for Olivier Giroud to be unleashed from the bench.

Fraser Forster performed superbly in the Southampton goal, reaching out his giant paws to produce save upon save, the best to keep out a looping header from Giroud. A minute later, however, Forster was beaten as his defensive shield tired and made a rare mistake. They were down to 10 men having lost Toby Alderweireld to injury after Ronald Koeman had used all his substitutes.

It allowed Aaron Ramsey to collect a stray ball in the Saints penalty area and cut it towards Sanchez, who gleefully turned it over the line. It was a shame for Forster, who did not deserve to be beaten.

But a triumph of sorts for Arsenal, who have won three on the bounce after losing at home to Manchester United and have kept three clean sheets with rookie goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez in the team.

Wenger confessed he was a little ‘cautious’ of declaring his problems were in the past. It was a relief to be stronger in defence, and he was grateful to have Laurent Koscielny back. But while tightening up at one end, his side seemed to lose some punch at the other, although piercing Southampton’s defensive shield is no mean feat. This was only the 10th goal they have conceded in 14 games.

They are the best in the Barclays Premier League, superbly well-drilled and committed. Even when a first-half injury to Jack Cork had forced a reshuffle, with Alderweireld moving from central defence to midfield, they remained solid while dangerous on the break.

‘We were unlucky with the injuries,’ said Koeman. ‘That gave Arsenal the motivation to carry on until the last second. Fraser Forster was outstanding but it not enough. That’s the risk in football. A lot of players are having hamstring problems. When it’s a kick maybe you can ask a player for five minutes more but it was a hamstring and you can’t continue as a player.’

It is a third game without a win for the Saints and the temptation is to think their bubble has burst. Next up are Manchester United, at St Mary’s on Monday, but Wenger said: ‘Don’t bury them too quickly. They are a good side. You have to count with Southampton for the top four.

‘Up front they are quick to come out, up front always first on the ball. They play in a very intelligent way. You always see they are a threat.’

Having won here in the Capital One Cup in September, Southampton arrived with confidence and Koeman’s fluent team did not take long to open up Arsenal.

Graziano Pelle and Steven Davis linked up neatly on the edge of the penalty area to create a clear chance for the Italian but his volley soared over. Koeman claimed it was the best chance of the half, although Welbeck had already missed one just as good.

Santi Cazorla unzipped the defence for Welbeck who, having been restored to a central role with fit-again Giroud resting on the bench, swept the ball wide.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was denied by Forster and a slip by Maya Yoshida, soon after coming on nearly proved costly. Welbeck, however, was unable to convert an ambitious back-heel from a tight angle.

Forster made a reflex save to deny Welbeck in stoppage time at the end of the first-half.

Welbeck’s glancing header from a free-kick swung in from the left by Sanchez, hit Alderweireld and deflected towards goal. It was directly at Forster, but the England goalkeeper had to be quick to turn it over.

Koscielny produced a smart block to thwart Pelle soon after the restart and Shane Long darted clear on the right only to miss the goal by some considerable distance.

Welbeck was soon in the thick of the action before half-time when he saw his fine header denied by man-of-the-match Forster

Arsenal were far more direct and threatening once Giroud was sent on for the last 25 minutes. Up went the pressure on Forster’s goal but the England keeper only increased in stature and confidence.

He beat away a sweet volley by Giroud at his near post and then made another splendid reaction save from Welbeck, throwing out a strong left hand and clawing the ball out.

Cazorla fired high and Wenger climbed to his feet as Arsenal fans roared on their side in search of a winner.

Aware that Chelsea were winning across the capital, they did not want to surrender more ground at the top of the table, but it was heading that way until Sanchez pounced.

‘He has such desire to fight and find something special to get the goal,’ said Wenger. ‘We are in December and he only arrived in July. When you look at his goals and the impact he has had on the team it is tremendous.’
