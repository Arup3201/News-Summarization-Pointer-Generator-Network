Sir Bob Russell MP offered a two-hour tour around his constituency town of Colchester - but it had no bids on eBay

A walking tour of Britain’s oldest recorded Roman town hosted by an MP has failed to attract any bids in an eBay auction.

The two-hour tour of Colchester, Essex, was to be led by Lib Dem Sir Bob Russell around the ‘significant places’ of his life.

Part of the East of England Lib Dems’ fundraising efforts, the tour was listed on eBay with a starting price of £40 – but Sir Bob was left red-faced after it failed to attract any bids despite being on offer for a week.

The ‘Rome around Colchester’, for one or two people, included high tea in the Castle Park Cafe.

The MP, who leads a free walk every New Year's Day, was tight-lipped about where he would escort the winning bidder as part of the tour.

The former councillor and Mayor of Colchester, elected to Parliament in 1997, said: 'We do not
get money from big business or trades union to fund our elections - 
money is raised by members and supporters.'

The sale was one lot in a supposed 'Amazing Autumn Auction' by the East of England Liberal Democrats to raise funds for their European election campaign.

But only one item sold as part of the event: a guided tour of St Alban's Abbey by Sandy Walkington, the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for St Albans.

The anonymous buyer paid £20 for the experience and described it as 'very good'.

Colchester, then called Camulodunum, was a key stronghold in the empire of Ancient Rome.

In AD41 it was the subject of a fierce battle to control Britain by the Roman emperor Claudius.

In 2005 archeologists unearthed the remains of a walled structure more than 1,000ft long which was believed to be a Roman circus or chariot racing arena.

One of several Roman finds in the city, it was the only verified example of a Roman circus in Britain.
