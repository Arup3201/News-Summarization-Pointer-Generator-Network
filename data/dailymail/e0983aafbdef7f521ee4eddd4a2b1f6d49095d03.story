The pioneering women and men behind the invention of the pill risked being arrested, a new book reveals.

The Birth of the Pill, which will be released on Monday, delves into the lives of the four 'crusaders' who brought the pill to fruition - feminist Margaret Sanger, scientist Gregory Pincus, OB-GYN John Rock and philanthropist Katharine McCormick, who funded most of the research.

It explains how in the Pill's initial stages in the 1950s, before its approval, Pincus and Rock tested it on 50 unknowing patients in Massachusetts under the guise of a fertility study, so as not to interfere with the state's anti-birth control laws.

History of birth control: The Birth of the Pill by Jonathan Eig, which will be released on Monday, delves into the lives of the four 'crusaders' who brought the Pill to fruition

The trial was successful - not one of the 50 women ovulated during the experiment - and the Pill went on to be one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century.

But the ethically ambiguous way they made this discovery is undeniably a topic of interest.

'You can really have a wonderful ethical discussion and debate about whether it was worth it, whether they were doing things that were beyond the bounds,' author Jonathan Eig told NPR.

'The laws and the ethics of science were very different in the 1950s than they are today - you didn't have to give informed consent, you didn't have to have anybody sign forms giving away their rights, telling them about what these experiments are for. 

'So in a way, we do have women being treated like lab animals so that we may find a form of birth control that frees them. There's a great irony there.'

The 'pioneers' were also not afraid to cut corners when it came to having the Pill approved and then marketed to women, coming up with a genius way of masking its true purpose.

'They decide, "We're not going to ask the FDA to approve it as birth control because that will raise a whole bunch of other issues. ... Let's just ask them to approve it for menstrual disorders,"' explains Mr Eig.

So, in 1957, the Pill was sold as Enovid - an FDA-approved treatment of menstrual disorders, with a label on the packaging that read: 'Warning: This pill will likely prevent pregnancy'.

'And it's the greatest advertisement they could ever have,' says Mr Eig, 'because this is what women want.'

The book chronicles the history of the birth control pill, from the idea's inception and its controversial inventors to the moment it hit shelves and ignited a sexual revolution.

It explains how the group banded together in the Fifties to create a pill that would finally grant women sexual freedom.

When McCormick, a very wealthy early suffragist, and Sanger, who founded Planned Parenthood in the Twenties, first met Pincus in the early Fifties, selling contraception was still illegal in many states. 

So they had to be careful not to attract too much attention when their research into a contraceptive pill went underway. 

'They absolutely could've been imprisoned for some of the work they were doing,' Mr Eig told NPR.

Pincus had recently been fired from his job as assistant professor at Harvard for his experimentation with in-vitro fertilization, and he was something of an outcast in the science world.

After the women approached him about inventing a 'miracle drug' that could stop ovulation, he became obsessed with the idea.

The science was there, but research and experimentation would be expensive; that's where McCormick came in. 

Contributions: Catholic physician John Rock (left) carried out experiments, and philanthropist Katharine McCormick (right) provided almost all the funds needed for research

A prominent member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, McCormick had been campaigning for women's rights - including to her own body.

According to PBS, at her very first meeting with Pincus, she wrote him a check for $40,000 - the first of many more to come. 

Indeed, with the inheritance she earned from her husband's death, McCormick funded nearly every dollar that went into making the Pill a reality.

The fourth person credited with the 'birth of the pill' in the book is John Rock - a pioneer in sperm freezing and the only Catholic physician to sign a petition to legalize birth control in 1931.

Once the Pill was approved, Rock fought long and hard to convince the Catholic community to accept it. In 1988 the Pope officially condemned the Pill in the encyclical Humanae Vitae, prompting Rock to stop attending mass for the first time in his life.

Mr Eig reveals how all four had to disguise the true purpose of their research and experimentation so as to keep naysayers away, which was the only way to make it a reality. 

'These guys are like guerrilla warriors - they're always having to figure out ways to do this thing that will attract the least attention,' he explains. 'They can never really say they're testing birth control.'

Mr Eig told NPR that he became inspired to write about this topic after he heard a rabbi say in his sermon that the Pill was the most important invention to come out of the 20th century. 

Skeptical at first, he soon realized it 'had changed more than just science, more than just medicine. It had changed human dynamics. It had changed the way men and women get along in the world.'

He continued: 'It changed reproduction, obviously, but it also created all kinds of opportunities for women that weren't there before, it had spread democracy.'
