The French appeals court has ruled that an investigation into allegations that former president Nicolas Sarkozy duped L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt into donating election campaign funds can proceed.

The decision, which could lead to a trial in the long-running scandal, complicates any political comeback by Sarkozy, who has been dogged for years by the 'Bettencourt affair' in which he denies any misconduct.

Sarkozy is the French conservative voters' favourite to take on Socialist President Francois Hollande in 2017 after losing to him last year.

But he could suffer if he is tried over allegations of exploiting the mental frailty of France's richest woman.

'There is more chance of a trial on the horizon for Sarkozy, and as for his eventual return to politics, it's obviously a lot more complicated for him' political analyst Christophe Barbier told iTele.

'He is no longer master of his own calendar.'

A lawyer for one of the 12 people investigated in the case said the decision would be appealed to the Cour de Cassation, the country's highest appeals court.

Sarkozy's lawyers, who did not comment on Tuesday's decision, have five days to join that appeal.A final judgment by that court could take many months, but Sarkozy could be called to face trial at any time.

Sarkozy was placed under formal 
investigation in March for "abuse of weakness" of Bettencourt after she 
was declared in a state of dementia. He was allegedly seeking funds for 
his 2007 election campaign.

Under
French law, a formal investigation means there is 'serious or 
consistent evidence' pointing to likely implication of a suspect in a 
crime. It often but not always leads to trial.

The public prosecutor handling the case recommended in June that it be dropped for lack of evidence.

In France, investigating magistrates can proceed with a formal inquiry over the objections of a prosecutor.

The
appeal court's decision on Tuesday to proceed with the investigation 
was announced to reporters outside the court in the southwest city of 
Bordeaux by Nicolas Huc-Morel, the Bettencourt family lawyer.

It
was prompted by a challenge mounted in July by lawyers for Sarkozy and 
11 others placed under investigation. They contested a 2011 medical 
report that determined Bettencourt had been suffering from dementia 
since 2006.

Lawyers argued 
the formal inquiry could not be viewed as impartial because one of the 
doctors involved in the report was a friend of the judge who placed 
Sarkozy under investigation, Jean-Michel Gentil.

'Were
the (medical) expertise to have fallen through, it would have weakened 
the case and the formal investigation could have caved in' Barbier said.
'In short, the main pillar in the Bettencourt case would have 
collapsed.'

Sarkozy has 
largely stayed out of the limelight since his defeat to Hollande last 
year, but has dropped hints this year that he is mulling a re-election 
bid.

Any comeback would 
hinge on the outcome of the Bettencourt case and a series of other legal
cases involving people close to him, including alleged political 
rigging in an arbitration payout to a high-profile businessman.

When the charges were first brough, Sarkozy was said to be in a 'state of incomprehension'.

The former French president has been charged with taking financial advantage of frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90.

With his political career in ruins, Mr Sarkozy now faces a criminal trial and the possibility of going to prison.

Deapite his legal team was preparing to 
appeal against the decision, political allies made it clear that he was 
shell shocked as he returned from Bordeaux - where he was charged - to 
the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla 
Bruni.

'As you can imagine he is in a state 
of incomprehension,' said Jean-Francois Cope, president of Mr Sarkozy's 
conservative UMP party.

Francois Fillon, Mr Sarkozy's former 
prime minister, went on to Twitter to say the decision was 'unfair' and 
said 'the truth will triumph'.

Mr Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog 
also attacked the indictment as 'legally incoherent and unfair' saying 
his client was being treated 'scandalously.'

Mr Sarkzoy was unexpectedly summoned on Thursday to the Bordeaux offices of Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in charge of the case.

There he met at least four former 
members of Bettencourt's staff, who said Mr Sarkozy regularly turned up 
at the Bettencourt mansion in Paris to accept cash to help fund his 2007
election campaign.

Mrs Bettencourt's doctors say her 
mental capacity began to deteriorate from the autumn of 2006, meaning 
she would have been particularly vulnerable to people asking her for 
money.

The principal allegation is that Mr 
Sarkozy obtained up to 4 million euros from her, breaching electoral 
spending limits and taking advantage of a person weakened by ill health.

Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in 
charge, hoped to establish today how many times Mr Sarkozy actually 
visited Mrs Bettencourt’s luxury Paris home in the months before he was 
elected.

Mr Sarkozy insists that it was only once, despite many former Bettencourt staff members saying he was always popping round.

The
principal allegation against Mr Sarkozy is that he took advantage of 
the frail state of the aged widow to take money from her.

Claire Thibout, Mrs Bettencourt’s 
former accountant, told police in 2010 that she had handed cash-filled 
envelopes to Bettencourt's financial manager, Patrice de Maistre, who 
subsequently passed them on to Mr Sarkozy's campaign treasurer, Eric 
Woerth.

Mr Sarkozy is also said to have collected money in person.

While Mr Sarkozy was being charged with the offences in Bordeaux, his wife Carla Bruni was in Berlin where she was performing at the Echo music awards.

She is about to make a return to modelling starring in a campaign for Italian fashion house Bulgari. Top fashion photographer Terry Richardson reportedly photographed Bruni in Rome for the campaign this week.

Ms Bruni has also recently completed a new album called Little French Songs in which she allegedly mocks current French Prime Minister Francois Hollande by referring to him as a penguin.

Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from 
prosecution when he lost the 2012 presidential election to his Socialist
rival Francois Hollande.

Within a few weeks, the home he shares with Ms Bruni was raided by anti-corruption police.

In 2011, Mr Sarkozy's predecessor, 
Jacque Chirac, was found guilty on corruption charges related to his 
time as mayor of Paris, and received a two-year suspended prison 
sentence.

Since losing to Mr Hollande, Mr 
Sarkozy had been trying to make money on the international conference 
circuit, but he also hinted that he might return to power in 2017.

But he faces numerous other 
corruption enquiries, including claims that he took cash from Colonel 
Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator.

Despite all this, Sarkozy has 
regularly hinted that he may still make a bid to return to the Elysee 
Palace in 2017. This now looks an impossibility.

Mrs Bettencourt was recently listed as the richest woman in the world by Forbes magazine.
