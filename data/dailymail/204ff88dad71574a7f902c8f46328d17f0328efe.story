With memories of summer flings fading faster than their tan lines the singletons of Britain are bracing themselves for lower temperatures and a dip in their standards.

Finite relationships are beginning up and down the country as men and women prepare for what is being dubbed as 'the cuffing season', a phenomenon involving lone rangers deciding to 'cuff' themselves to an unwitting partner so they have someone to attend parties with and cuddle up to in winter. 

As the temperatures drop, so do our romantic standards.. the cuffing season has begun 

Many romance experts warn that if you find yourself in a seasonal-specific relationship like this you should beware of forming attachments as come spring you may be dumped.

But FEMAIL Sexpert Tracey Cox is a little more optimistic. She says: 'It's absolutely true that people feel more comfortable being single in summer - everyone is a lot more social when the weather is good, so you're less lonely if you're not paired up. Snuggly weather makes you wish for someone to snuggle up with!

'But while I think cuffing is a real phenomena, most people do it on a subconscious basis rather than deliberately choosing relationships they assume will only last a few months. 

'Most of us find it hard to separate our hearts from our heads. It's a bit like casual sex. A lot of one-night-stands end up turning into long term love, even if we never expected it to!'

Lone rangers in the UK are increasingly 'cuffing' themselves to an unwitting partner for the winter

Sex and relationship blogger Nixalina Watson of the award-winning Sex And London City says: 'I have heard of cuffing season before and believe it or not, it happens a lot more than people think. 

'The idea makes me chuckle - basically grabbing yourself a seasonal partner then ditching them when the sun comes out. It is like hibernation of your single life. We all prefer to stay indoors during the cold winter months and, if single, this isn't as fun as cuddling up to someone.

'I know a girl who realised she'd been dragged into the cuffing season only after he ditched her come March. Brutal. She thought long term, he thought only until winter is over. 

'You don't want a partner who says "I will love you until the clocks go forward".'

An anonymous twenty-something London-based designer added: 'It's a running joke with my friends that every year around autumn time I get a new boyfriend, it's like clockwork. Guys all seem to be looking for a girlfriend in the winter, then in summer no one wants to settle down - they're just looking for easy hook ups which I'm not really into.

'Saying that, I've always broken up with guys just before summer - not intentionally but summer gives you the feeling that you don't want to be tied down by something that's not really working. You want to be free to have fun. In winter, your friends are less likely to want to go out in the cold and do things, but having a relationship is like guarantee for having company.' 

Many singletons are facing up to the cold hard fact that they want some temporary companionship

People are noticing their friends hooking up and are suspicious it's down to cuffing season

Chris HInes, Editor-In-Chief of music magazine Hit The Floor, reveals a man's view: 'I've never known it as cuffing season as such, but this time of year is definitely where those who were longing for a summer romance, and failed, or people who had a bit too much fun, seem to want to all of a sudden settle down.

'Why? Maybe it's just the weather making people sad and everyone lowers their standards. I can imagine that previous 6 becoming a strong 8; perhaps thanks to 'Winter Goggles'. 

'Come the Spring it's all about the 'culling' though. If you're looking for a serious relationship you best be ready to put the leg work in good and start getting good at buying Christmas presents!' 

Match.com's Kate Taylor adds: 'Winter is a wonderful time of year to be in love. Have you ever seen a Richard Curtis film that doesn't feature snow falling, or a kiss under the mistletoe? We often find people looking for love in the winter aren't hoping for a seasonal fling that dies before the clocks go forward.'
