Amanda Berry has been pictured for the first time since the day of her incredible escape from the home of Ariel Castro, where she was allegedly imprisoned for more than a decade.

The 27-year-old looked 
like any other healthy young woman as she snacked on tacos during a trip to Elizabethton, 
Tennessee, where she was reunited with her dying father after 10 years apart.

She traveled to see her father Johnny for Father's Day weekend and was joined by her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn, who was fathered by Castro during her imprisonment.

Johnny, who is nearly paralyzed and suffers from pulmonary disease, recounted how they sobbed as they held each other for the first time since Amanda was a teenager.

Free: Amanda Berry has been pictured for the first time since shortly after her escape from Ariel Castro's home. She was seen in Tennessee during a trip to visit her father for the first time since she was freed

Fighter: Her father has previously said that Amanda is suffering nightmares of her decade-long ordeal

'When Amanda came through my front door 
it was like a miracle,' he told the National Enquirer. 'She started crying and ran up to 
me and we hugged for the first time in 10 years. I had tears in my eyes 
the size of raindrops.'

Along with Amanda's sister Beth Serrano, they spent five days together and enjoyed picnics with other members of the family.

'Spending time with my daughter Amanda and my granddaughter was the best Father's Day ever,' Johnny, 53, said.

He added that he did not ask many questions about her time locked up in the Cleveland home.

'I'm going to let her talk about it when
she's ready,' he said. 'I'm just happy sheâ€™s back home. I'm here for her and ready
to help in any way I can.'

Family time: Amanda was visiting Elizabethton in Tennessee for an emotional reunion with her father

Trip: Amanda was pictured snacking on some tacos earlier this month during the Father's Day trip

'If I could get my hands on that monster Castro, I'd kill him myself,' he has previously said.

Amanda now intends to finish her high 
school education and wants to eventually go to junior college, her 
father said. She is considering putting her daughter in school next 
year.

The last time that Johnny Berry saw his daughter, she was working as a 16-year-old in the local Burger King, enjoying her time at school where she was doing well.

She was dramatically rescued from Castro's Cleveland home along with Gina DeJesus, Michelle Knight and her six-year-old Jocelyn on May 6.

The three women had been kept prisoner by Castro for almost ten years and suffered systematic rapes, beatings and induced abortions at the hands of the 52-year-old former school bus driver.

Getting back to normality: Amanda, her daughter and sister spent five days with her father in Tennessee

Reunion: Her father Johnny, who is suffering from pulmonary disease, said they were in tears when they saw each other for the first time since before her imprisonment more than 10 years ago

Family: She is pictured center with her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn, who is also Castro's daughter, and her sister Beth Serrano hours after she escaped the house in May

Sighting: Amanda Berry was last pictured as she returned to her sister's home on May 8

Amanda, who is now 27 is living currently with her sister Beth Serrano in Cleveland and is said to be suffering from the horrifying memories of her ordeal at the hands of Castro.

He has now been charged with 329 counts including kidnapping, rape and murder in connection with his imprisonment of the three women and prosecutors deciding on whether to seek death penalty

The case is back in court; the sharing of evidence between prosecutors and defense lawyers is among the issues before Judge Michael Russo in Cleveland in the hearing Wednesday morning.

The 52-year-old Castro has pleaded not guilty to the 329-count indictment, with even more charges still possible. A judge ruled he must undergo a competency hearing this week.

The defense wants county prosecutor Tim McGinty to take the death penalty off the table to clear the way for a plea deal. McGinty hasn't said if he'll pursue a death sentence for an alleged forced miscarriage involving one victim.
