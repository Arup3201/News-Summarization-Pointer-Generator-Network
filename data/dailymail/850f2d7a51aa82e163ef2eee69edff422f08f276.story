A Midwest developer who bought an underground missile silo earlier this year and has been transforming it from a Cold War relic into luxury bunker condominiums just completed his renovations.

Developer Larry Hall of north central Kansas says he isn’t worried about the end of the world happening this year.

But he is planning ahead for those concerned about a potential regional, national or global crisis on the horizon.

'Luxury Survival Condo': Developer Larry Hall converted a Cold War missile silo into a luxury condo complex for those fearing the next potential crisis

Precaution: Hall says he isn¿t worried about the end of the world happening this year, but he is planning ahead for those concerned about a potential regional, national or global crisis on the horizon

His underground bunker condominium complex, Luxury Survival Condo, was finished just in time for Friday, December 21, a date some predicated the world would end.

However, dissipating Doomsday fears have actually caused Hall to turn away some potential buyers, he says.

‘We really are looking for long-term neighbors not people who just want to come in here and buy it and turn around and flip it as soon as one threat passes,’ he tells local NBC affiliate station KSHB.

All of the condos on the underground complex’s 14 floors were bought earlier this year, Hall says.

The condo spaces went on the market for $2 million a floor or $1 million a half floor, the AFP reported in April. Now each floor costs $3 million, according to KSHB.

All the comforts of home: The condos even have ensuite toilets and double sinks

Hall, a former software engineer, says he sold every unit before renovation on the structure was even finished.

The application process for each buyer so far involved a strict background check, even if that tenant was able to pay the full cost up front.

The catastrophe-proof building was designed as an ‘underground society’ equipped with a doctor's office, bowling alley, movie thearter, swimming pool, shooting range and emergency jail cell.

The building also contains intricate life support systems that provide energy supplies from various sources including windmills and generators.

Giant underground tanks hold water that is pre-filtered through carbon and sand.

‘You can use this and be very comfortable in owning it and in the back of your mind knowing there is a hidden use that if you had to use it for survival capabilities you've got one of the best bunkers on the planet,’ says Hall.

The crisis-minded developer says he isn’t done renovating missile silos.

He purchased two more silos in the Concordia, Kansas area with a similar plan in mind.

'If I had to start from scratch it would probably be economically not feasible,' he says. 'But by starting with a nuclear hardened structure that is the more expensive of the two requirements, I could leverage that towards towards my goal.'

Hall began planning his underground condominiums five years ago.

‘When anything is possible, preparation is peace of mind,’ the Luxury Survival Condo website states.
