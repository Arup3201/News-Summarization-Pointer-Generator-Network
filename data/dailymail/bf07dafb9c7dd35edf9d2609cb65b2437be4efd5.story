A policeman's father executed a murder plan which he called 'The 12 days of Christmas' in which he battered to death a millionairess and buried her body down a garden well.

Serial liar Christopher Symons killed wealthy Patricia Goodband before hiding her body in the 12ft deep shaft in a bid to inherit her fortune.

A jury today convicted the 63-year-old of murder and also found his 73-year-old lover guilty of perverting the course of justice.

Guilty: Christopher Symons (left) has been found guilty of the murder of Patricia Goodband (right) which he tried to cover up with a day-by-day plan called the 'The 12 days of Christmas'

The court had earlier been shown Symons's murder jottings which he called 'The 12 days Xmas' in which he planned a day-by-day list of tasks to try to cover up Patricia Goodband’s murder.

The incriminating list was found in his car by detectives searching for clues about her death. Ironically, Symons’s own son works as a detective in the same police force.

Symons mapped out in detail his plan to get away with murder as he enlisted his elderly lover and a grave digger friend to help him cover his tracks.

Among the web of lies he created included a claim that he had a quadraplegic son and that his granddaughter had undergone heart surgery.

But his plot unravelled when police found the scrap of paper in his Toyota Hilux outlining his cover story.

The memo covered the period from when Mrs Goodband was last seen alive to when she was due back at work.

Detectives described the sketch as a key piece of evidence against Symons, who denied killing his business partner.

The court heard Mrs Goodband was 'emotionally attached' to Symons, her friend of over 30 years the jury previously heard.

12 Days of XmasPolice said December 22, last year, is the date Mrs Goodband went missing.

Police have said that January 3, 2013, was the date Mrs Goodband was due to start back at her cleaning job.

In 2008, she created a will in which she left two properties worth an estimated £800,000 and her savings totalling £230,000 to her killer.

Mrs Goodband, who ran a haulage business with Symons from her home, was last seen alive three days before Christmas, on December 22.

She was reported missing by her concerned daughter on January 9.

Symons told officers investigating her disappearance that Mrs Goodband had told him she was heading to the North over the festive period.

As part of his plan to throw detectives off the scent, Symons sent himself a series of text messages from Patricia’s phone to mislead officers - and used two others to back up his deceit.

One of his two mistresses, Jennifer Creasey, admitted penning a fake Christmas card from ‘Sue’ to ‘Pat’ indicating that Mrs Goodband was due to arrive in Stockton-on-Tees on December 22, last year.

She also lied to police in her witness statement.

Grave digger Robert Taft initially backed up the cover story claiming falsely that he had dropped the missing woman off at Milton Keynes railway station but later crumbled and admitted he had lied.

Following a painstaking investigation, Mrs Goodband’s body was found concealed in the deep well shaft in the garden of her home in the rural village of Woodham, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on January 21 this year.

She had been repeatedly beaten around the head before her body was thrown into the well and covered by 22 tonnes of soil, stone and bags of rubbish.

Symons, of Aylesbury, was found guilty on a single charge of murder by the jury after just over four hours deliberation.

As the four women and eight men jury delivered their verdict Symons, wearing a grey suit, appeared emotionless and stared straight ahead.

The moment Christopher Symons’s plan of lies and deceit came crashing down has been captured during his police interview with detectives.

A video clip of the recording shows his surprise at the revelation that Robert Taft had already admitted lying to officers over Mrs Goodband’s disappearance.

The footage, taken at Aylesbury police 
station, Buckinghamshire, from midnight on January 14 has been released by Thames 
Valley Police after Symons’ conviction for the pensioner's murder today.

Interviewing detective said: 'Right Chris. Enough is enough now.

'Robert Taft has been interviewed. He’s admitted to lying to police and stated that although he picked you up, he never picked Patricia up.

'It was just you two.

Symons: 'Oh, that does surprise me.'

Symonss’ solicitor: 'Chris, do you want to take a break?'

Symons: 'Yeah, sure.'

Creasey, aged 73 years, of Benson, Oxfordshire, had been charged by police with two counts of perverting the course of justice.

She
was found not guilty of one count, which related to writing the 
Christmas card, but convicted of the second after the jury found she 
lied to police in her witness statement.

Grave
digger Robert Taft, aged 59 years, of Aylesbury, Bucks, has already 
admitted 'telling a lie' to police about dropping Mrs Goodband off at 
Milton Keynes train station.

Symons’s
sister, Kathleen Adams, 74, of Princess Risborough, Bucks, was cleared 
by the jury of one count of perverting the course of justice.

Symons, Creasey and Taft are due to be sentenced by Judge Zoe Smith at Reading Crown Court next week.

Speaking
after the verdicts Detective Superintendent Chris Ward said: 'It was a 
complicated investigation where Symons attempted, by his series of lies,
to rail-road a missing person investigation.

'He (Symons) went to a great deal of trouble to create and document a story to cover up his murderous actions.

'He used a web of lies as part of his deceit, but the jury saw through that.

'This was an horrific, cold-blooded pre-planned murder.

'The
family of Patricia Goodband have had to endure three weeks of harrowing
evidence and we are pleased with the verdict of the jury.'
