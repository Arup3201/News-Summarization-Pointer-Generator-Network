Images have emerged of two plane tickets believed to have been purchased using stolen passports for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight.

As relatives of the 239 people on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 continued to wait anxiously for news of their loved ones, attention has focused on how two passengers boarded the aircraft using stolen passports.

Pictures have now emerged of what appears to be the tickets purchased by the stolen passport users, as Malaysian police say one of them has been identified.

Images of two plane tickets believed to have been purchased for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight using stolen passports have emerged

The two stolen passports, one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy, were entered into Interpol's database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said

Interpol has confirmed it knew about the stolen passports but said no authorities checked its vast databases on stolen documents before the jet departed.

Warning that 'only a handful of countries' routinely make such checks, Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble chided authorities for 'waiting for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates'.

There was no indication that the two men had anything to do with the tragedy, but the thefts of the passports added a twist to the plane's mysterious disappearance.

The two stolen passports, one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy, were entered into Interpol's database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said.

Electronic booking records show that one-way tickets with those names were issued Thursday from a travel agency in the beach resort of Pattaya in eastern Thailand.

Thai police Col. Supachai Phuykaeokam said those reservations were placed with the agency by a second travel agency in Pattaya, which in turn made the bookings through a China Southern Airlines office in Bangkok.

The owners of the second Pattaya travel agency, which police said caters mostly to Iranian travelers, refused to talk to reporters. Thai police and Interpol officers went in to question the owners.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Sunday that officials have footage of the two men, and were examining it. He said local and international intelligence agencies were involved in the investigation. 

A telephone operator on a China-based KLM hotline confirmed Sunday that passengers named Maraldi and Kozel had been booked on one-way tickets on the same KLM flight, flying from Beijing to Amsterdam on Saturday. Maraldi was to fly on to Copenhagen, Denmark, and Kozel to Frankfurt, Germany.

As holders of EU passports with onward flights to Europe, the passengers would not have needed visas for China.

Interpol said it and national investigators were working to determine the true identities of those who used the stolen passports to board the flight.

Interpol has long sounded the alarm that growing international travel has underpinned a new market for identity theft: Bogus passports are mostly used by illegal immigrants, but also pretty much anyone looking to travel unnoticed such as drug runners or terrorists. More than 1 billion times last year, travellers boarded planes without their passports being checked against Interpol's database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents, the police agency said.

Azharuddin also said the baggage of five passengers who had checked in to the flight but did not board the plane was removed before it departed. Airport security was strict according to international standards, surveillance has been done and the airport has been audited, he said.
