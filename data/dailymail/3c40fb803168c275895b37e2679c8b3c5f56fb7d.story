Workers on a Western Australian building site have turned their crane into a makeshift carnival ride.

Crazy footage shows a tradesman hooked up to a crane with a harness as the machine spins around and sends him flying.

His workmates can be heard laughing in the background as they film the dangerous end-of-year stunt.

Workers on a Western Australian building site have filmed their friend hooked up to a crane

 The tradesmen looked on as he was spun around like he was on a carnival ride

In the video, the man in the harness looks at the camera and waves before yelling out 'Hi mum!'

He appears to not be wearing a helmet, just a backwards baseball cap.

The man can be seen flapping his arms up and down and striking a superman pose as he is spun around by a colleague operating the crane. 

One of the people watching from the sidelines can be heard yelling out 'Faster, Jeremy!'

When the crane stops spinning around abruptly the momentum causes the man in the harness to swing and almost smash into the crane's arm.

The man is dressed in a hi-vis shirt but appears to not be wearing a helmet, just a backwards baseball cap

A spokesperson for WorkSafe said they were aware of the video and were reviewing it

The footage was uploaded to the LiveLeak website and tagged under Western Australia. 

It has been viewed almost 1600 times since it was posted on Tuesday.

It is believed that the incident was filmed on December 17.

A spokesperson for WorkSafe said they were aware of the video and were reviewing it, Perth Now reported.
