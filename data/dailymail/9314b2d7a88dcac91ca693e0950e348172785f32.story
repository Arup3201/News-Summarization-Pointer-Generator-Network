Whether James Corden’s reign as the host of American chat show The Late Late Show is a success in the long-run remains to be seen, but his debut last night proved one thing categorically: James Corden has arrived.

Corden’s career has already seen him co-star in a Disney film with Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep and win a Tony award for his performances on Broadway beating Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John Lithgow, and James Earl Jones. This made those look like amateur dramatics.

James Corden made his debut as the host of American chat show The Late Late Show last night

At 36-years-old Corden’s younger than his rivals on other networks and never before presented a chat show

It wasn’t just that the guests for his first show were Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis. As major as they are, they were almost incidental.

The devil was in the detail.

To say CBS were determined to ANNOUNCE Corden’s arrival and put him on the map is an understatement.

The President of CBS himself, Leslie Moonves, appeared in a segment bestowing upon Corden the opportunity of the job in the manner of a Golden Ticket a la Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory.

Several big names  also made fleeting appearances trying to find it and get the gig too, with such illustrious stars as Chris Rock, Billy Crystal, Simon Cowell, Lena Dunham, Chelsea Handler, and Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne reduced to the status of Corden's supporting cast.

Other cameos came from Shia LaBeouf, Arnold Schwarzenegger as his personal trainer, Jay Leno knocking him about a bit, and Meryl Streep giving him a pep talk using lyrics from Lady Gaga.

Phew. There was probably a celebrity kitchen sink in there too.

It’s little wonder Corden was overwhelmed.

So many members of the public and the media have given their opinion over the past few weeks on whether James Corden will cut it that judging him after only one programme seems almost reasonable.

But hey that’s showbiz. Corden himself has been around long enough to know that.

Welcome: Celebrity guests Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks were almost incidental in last nights proceedings

Corden managed to secure an exclusive from actress Mila Kunis with the news that she had already married Ashton Kutcher

At 36 he’s younger than his rivals on other networks and never even presented a chat show before but he’s been building up to this moment since the days he appeared in a Tango ad and an episode of Hollyoaks 15 years ago.

His first episode presenting The Late Late Show must go down as a success. Besides delivering the likes of Hanks, Streep, and Arnie, Cordon secured an exclusive from Mila Kunis with the news that she had married Ashton Kutcher – even though the revelation was probably rehearsed rather than spontaneous.

The parodies with Tom Hanks also showed Corden in his element – being funny, and clearly having a great time.

Nonetheless, watching Corden bounce out on to the set for his much-discussed debut, like a boisterous, British Tigger and nervously tap his question cards while he gabbled to Hanks and Kunis, made you worry whether he can add being an American chat show host to his repertoire.

You even almost felt sorry for him. This is a strange thing to say and somewhat ironic, considering the self-confessed “chunky unit” from High Wycombe is not so much living the American Dream as fulfilling the fantasy of every ambitious actor, comedian, and TV presenter across the globe.

You didn’t envy him. But you had to admire his courage.

After all, there are no audiences more demanding or instantly unforgiving than the critics or viewers of American television.

And the nightly, late-night, talk show is one of the great staples of American television – a tradition that made the likes of Johnny Carson, Merv Griffin, Jay Leno, and David Letterman among the most famous stars in the country, making their weekly UK equivalents Jonathon Ross, Graham Norton, and even Parkinson look like part-timers.

Corden represents a risky choice, even without the minor detail that he has never presented a chat show before. True, Corden is taking over The Late Late Show from another relatively obscure Brit - Scotsman Craig Ferguson, whose reign lasted an impressive/incredible ten years.

But as Piers Morgan found out when he succeeded CNN legend Larry King, these are different times. The appointment of an English star now causes instant controversy with American audiences and the U.S. press not to mention jealousy from other comedians or presenters.

Corden’s biggest dilemma is whether he should play safe or whether he needs to be more edgy.

Another issue is how much of a twist Corden can give such a well-established format.

Americans’ fondness for Johnny Carson, Letterman, Leno, and Ferguson’s Late Late Show has been based on a familiarity established over decades. They were essentially the same every night.

On the other hand, the likes of Stephen Colbert, Conan O’Brien, Jon Stewart, and Saturday Night Live have thrived thanks to their subversive, satirical, bite and unpredictability.

So far Corden has hedged his bets.

His version of The Late Late Show sticks faithfully to the formula of a house band, smooth comic monologue, and sketches.

But there have already been rumours that some celebrities and their PRs are unhappy with the major change Corden and his UK producer have introduced – bringing the guests out on to the sofa at the same time and chatting to them together.

This was a feature of The Johnny Carson Show but faded in favour of giving stars the spotlight, being recently revived in this country by Graham Norton.

Corden is young, largely unknown, and a novice - prompting several cries on American forums and social media of ‘who?’

In theory, his position gives him a chance to start from scratch, and make a name for himself as a distinctive original like fellow Brits abroad, Ricky Gervais, Russell Brand, and Sacha Baron Cohen.

The problem is, this is not James Corden’s style.

In fact, Corden’s main handicap may be the characteristic that is usually his biggest asset.

Despite his clearly prodigious talents, Corden’s appeal has always been based on his everyday charm, gregarious enthusiasm, and evident excitement at what he’s doing.

But it’s hard to imagine that America will tolerate any repeats of Corden’s excruciatingly sycophantic interview with Gary Barlow and star-struck sketches with David Beckham. During his years presenting A League Of Their Own, the way Corden’s been in awe of cricket star Freddie Flintoff and co. hardly bodes well for coping with America’s A list.

After all, The Late Late Show is not breakfast television. The clue’s in the name...

It’s true that his lovable cheek was such a hit in the Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors that he won a Tony, but you doubt his arrival will really be what one CBS presenter helpfully hyped as ‘the next step on the evolution of late night comedy.’

Corden will certainly struggle to provide the softly cynical insights and streetwise quips about the workings of celebrity and showbusiness that the likes of Letterman, Leno and their successors Conan O’Brien and Jimmy Fallon rely on in their interviews.

It was hard to believe that Americans were going to respond well to the persona of a modest, apologetic Brit that Corden has presented.

America likes its stars to be special not ordinary.

Corden’s approach has been that of the bumbling, stunned ‘civilian’ who can’t believe his luck or done anything to earn his ‘Golden Ticket.’

American audiences are too sophisticated not to see through the mock humility when he says ‘it’s almost too much for my tiny brain to take in’ or ‘I’m talking as if I have any authority on this. I know nothing !’

A much better balance came in Corden’s anecdote about becoming annoyed that a photographer was taking pictures of him dining, only to find they were of Mila, who was eating in the same restaurant.

The way that Corden and Hanks dressed up and parodied the star’s most famous movies gave Corden his chance to do what he does best: ham it up and endearingly play the fool, not least when he put a wig on to be Meg Ryan from Sleepless In Seattle.

They finished by singing ‘You've Got A Friend In Me’ from Toy Story.

The grand finale saw Corden take to a grand piano to sing a song about his first night in the American limelight.

No one could say he didn’t give it his all.
