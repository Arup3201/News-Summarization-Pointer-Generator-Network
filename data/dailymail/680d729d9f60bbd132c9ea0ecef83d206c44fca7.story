From politicians to primary schools, unions and sports clubs – no one was exempt from being shamed by the 2014 Ernie Awards which call out the worst sexist comments and policies made in the last year. 

Christopher Pyne, Australia's education minister, took out two of the top awards for the night, both the Gold and the Political Silver Ernie, for his comment that university fee increases won't disproportionately affect women.

'Women are well-represented amongst the teaching and nursing students,' he said during an appearance on ABC's 7:30 Report.

'They will not be able to earn the high incomes that say dentists or lawyers will earn.'

Education minister Christopher Pyne (left) and Senator Eric Abetz (right) went head to head in the category for the Political Silver Ernie, with Mr Pyne proving to be the worse offender 

Senator Eric Abetz came a close second in the political category however, with his academically inspiring comment: 'I think the studies, and they date back from the 1950s, have said there is a link between abortion and breast cancer'.

Both Mr Pyne and Mr Abetz's statements had attendees booing, whistling and thumping their fists at their dinner tables - the procedure by which votes are determined -  for almost 30 seconds after being read out, before a 'boo-off' soon declared Mr Pyne the winner.

But who could forget Brian Woods, a member of the Palmer united party whose comment left women everywhere reminiscing about the good old 1950s.

Kyle and Jackie O won an award for questioning Channel Nine sports journalist, Erin Molan, about how many sportsmen she had slept with and whether she has had breast implants

Wicked Campervans won the Industrial Silver Ernie for the sexist slogans painted on the back of their vans

Meredith Burgmann, the organiser of the event, read out Mr Woods' comment from the stand with revulsion: 'Domestic violence is solely a woman's choice when it comes to women being assaulted. I'm saying women have a choice to accept it or leave it... don't whinge to me. Dump them or have them removed by law order'.

Tony Abbott was also nominated under the political category for three separate occasions, including his infamous wink while speaking to an elderly woman while on the radio who admitted she was forced to work on a sex-line to make ends meet. 

However, the Prime Minister was instead awarded the Repeat Offenders award, for the eighth year, at the end of the night.

Amongst the least surprising winners of the night was Wicked Camper Vans, who were awarded the Industrial Silver Ernie for a number of slogans which appeared on the back of their vans including 'Life sucks if your girlfriend doesn't' and 'In every princess, there's a little s**t who wants to try it just once'.

But it was Chevron, the oil and gas company, that left guests bewildered when it was announced that their job application form had asked applicants to supply details about their reproductive past including whether they had ever been pregnant, had a termination and whether their children had been born with any birth defects.

Kyle Sandilands and Jacki O won the Celebrity/Clerical award for questioning a female sports journalist, Erin Molan, on-air about how many sportsmen she had slept with and whether she has had breast implants. 

Journalist Piers Akerman was a clear winner for the Media Silver Ernie, with seven nominations including one for referring to the former governor general as 'the current clothes horse Quentin Bryce'.

But it was Mr Akerman's comments about cartoon Peppa Pig that scored him the take-home prize.

'Even the cartoon character Peppa Pig pushes a weird feminist line that would be closer to the hearts of Labor's Handbag Hit Squad than the pre-school audience it is aimed at,' he wrote when referring to the ABC's 'left wing agenda'.

A More than 70 nominations were read out across eight categories on the night, with Tony Abbott being awarded the Repeat Offenders award

Meredith Burgmann, the event organiser, celebrated the 22nd year of the event alongside 330 attendees 

The Daily Telegraph's Sydney Confidential section also raised an eyebrow or two and encouraged some foot stamping amongst attendees, for their editorial regarding model Lara Bingle. 

'Her reps have denied she is pregnant, her breasts however fail to pertain to the rumours. Shots of her looking increasingly baxen in the surf suggest that if she wasn't pregnant, she'd at least had a recent boob job,' the Ernies organiser and founder Meredith Burgmann read out at the podium. 

The traditional celebration which has entered its 22nd year saw the coming together of over 300 women and men from all ages and backgrounds in New South Wales Parliament House on the night, when more than 70 nominations were read out.
