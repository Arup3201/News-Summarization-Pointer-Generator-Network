Jose Mourinho revealed the cost of reaching Wembley was a trio of injuries to Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis and match-winner Branislav Ivanovic. 

Fabregas faces a race against time to be fit for Saturday's Premier League showdown against Manchester City after limping off in Chelsea's Capital Cup semi-final win over Liverpool.

The midfielder collided with Blues team-mate John Terry at the beginning of the second half at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night and was unable to continue.

Fabregas was replaced by Ramires in the 50th minute and headed straight down the tunnel to receive treatment on a hamstring problem. 

Luis (calf) was also withdrawn late on, while goalscorer Ivanovic suffered a cut foot.

'Branislav was able to continue but the others weren't,' said Mourinho. 

'Filipe Luis came off with a calf problem and Fabregas reported a tight hamstring. Fabregas said he wasn't yet injured but that he would be soon if he continued.

'I don't want to think about fatigue. If we played two hours and lost I would be more worried. They are happy and when you are happy you can cope with fatigue. But obviously we played for two hours and we have to play on Saturday against City, who didn't.'
