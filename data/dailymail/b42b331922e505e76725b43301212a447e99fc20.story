Indian police are questioning a school bus cleaner on suspicion of raping a four-year-old after luring her to the back of the vehicle near Mumbai earlier this month.

The 26-year-old was arrested at the weekend after the girl told her parents of the incident more than a week after it occurred on September 6, police said.

News of the assault comes days after four men were sentenced to death last week over the fatal gang-rape of a student in the capital New Delhi in December, a brutal attack that led to weeks of protests and outrage over the treatment of women and girls in India.

Financial hub Mumbai, long considered safer for women than New Delhi, has also been recently rocked by the gang-rape of a photographer in August while she was out on assignment in the city with a male colleague.

According to the police complaint filed by the four-year-old's parents, she and her friend were the first to climb on to the bus after classes in the Thane district neighbouring Mumbai.

'The cleaner called her to the back seat on the pretext of showing her some tricks. He then caught the girl and raped her,' said inspector S.K. Mohite at the local Badlapur police station.

The girl screamed and her friend went to help her, but the man threatened to kill them if they reported the matter to the school, the inspector said.

'There was no woman attendant on the bus at that time,' he added.

Mohite said the girl has undergone medical examination and doctors confirmed she was sexually assaulted.

'Medical details and investigations into the cleaner's past are being gathered,' he added.

The outcry over the Delhi gang-rape led to a tougher law in India against rapists, but cases of sexual violence have continued throughout the country.

Five suspects have been arrested over the Mumbai photographer's gang-rape and are expected to be formally charged later this week.

On average, a case of rape in India is reported every 21 minutes, but it was only after the horrific fatal gang rape and torture of Jyoti Singh last December received global media attention, that the government has has stepped up its efforts to deal with the crime.

The victim, who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus, became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country.

After violent protests in several cities the government, initially caught off guard, introduced tougher rape laws in March, and for the first time opened conversation about gender crime in television debates, social media and even Bollywood.

Still, sex crimes remain commonplace in India, and social commentators say patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a decade of rapid economic growth.

Rights campaigners have staged protest rallies across Pakistan over the rape of a five-year-old girl in the eastern city of Lahore.

Police still have no clue who carried out the attack despite detaining several suspects and releasing most of them after questioning.

Police say the child was found outside a Lahore hospital on Friday night, a day after she went missing from a poor neighbourhood in the city.

'Her condition is relatively stable but still she is in the intensive care unit,' doctor Farzand Ali, medical superintendent at the Services Hospital, told AFP.

Senior police officer Zulfiqar Hameed said investigators have questioned several suspects but had yet to arrest anyone.

'We are investigating and we hope steady progress (is being made) but no one has yet been identified nor anyone formally arrested," Hameed told AFP.

Doctors earlier said the child was raped several times.

Rights campaigners and workers from NGOs on Saturday and Sunday staged protest rallies across Pakistan and demanded the arrest of the culprits.

Widespread outrage has dominated social media while private TV channels prominently broadcast reports on the girl and her ordeal.

Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute in Pakistan, where women are often treated as second-class citizens.

In neighbouring India, a judge on Friday sentenced to death four men convicted of the fatal gang rape of a student on a New Delhi bus last December, fulfilling the last wish of the 23-year-old victim who died of her injuries.
