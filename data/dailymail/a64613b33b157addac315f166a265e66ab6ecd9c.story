English men might want to look away now.

Italians came out on top in a ‘sex of the nations survey’.

Some 64 per cent of the Italian men and women polled said they were satisfied with their love life.

A poll found 64 per cent of Italians are satisfied with their love lives compared to 54 per cent of English people. The survey was conducted as part of a drive, supported by rugby players Sean Maitland of Scotland (left) and Danny Care of England (right), to encourage people to seek help for their sexual health problems

England only managed a below average 54 per cent – the lowest of the six nations surveyed.

However, Scots shouldn’t be too smug.

The survey of more than 6,000 people from Italy, France, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland found Scots to have the lowest expectations.

Almost one in ten said they expect sex to last less than two minutes.

The poll also revealed Scottish people have the lowest sexual expectations. Dan Biggar of Wales (pictured) has also been involved in the campaign

In contrast over a third of Italians think more than ten minutes to be the norm.

The
 research, commissioned to help highlight the prevalence of premature 
ejaculation, the most common male sexual health problem, also found that
 more than one fifth of people would like sex to last longer.

However, few had aired their concerns with their doctor, with the English, Scots and Welsh being least likely to seek help.

Martin Tod, chief executive of the Men’s Health Forum, said: ‘Premature ejaculation can lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment.

‘It can have a real negative impact on quality of life for men and their partners.

‘It is more common than people think and men should not feel embarrassed to do something about it.

‘Help is available from your GP.  There’s no need to suffer in silence.’

The research was done for drug company Menarini, which has teamed up with international rugby players, Danny Care, Sean Maitland and Dan Biggar, to encourage people to seek help for sexual problems.
