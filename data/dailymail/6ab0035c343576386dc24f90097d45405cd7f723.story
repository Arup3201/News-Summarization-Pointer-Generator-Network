Pope Benedict XVI hopes that 2013 will be a peaceful year despite the threat of terrorism and 'unregulated financial capitalism'.

Around 10,000 worshippers converged on St Peter's Basilica today for the Pontiff's New Years Day Mass and to mark the Catholic Church's World Day of Peace.

In his homily, Pope Benedict said that despite today’s terrorism, criminality and the inequality between rich and poor, he is convinced the 'numerous works of peace, of which the world is rich, are testimony to the innate vocation of humanity to peace.'

He cited 'unregulated financial capitalism' as evidence of an 'egotistical and individualistic mentality' that is rife in the world.

His address was no doubt aimed at the front pews: diplomats accredited to the Holy See, who next week will attend the pope’s annual address about the plight of the world’s poor and its war-torn regions.

The 85-year-old Pope compared the New Year to a journey and prayed that it 'may lead on a path to peace for every person and every family, for each country and for the whole world.'

Later, Benedict appeared at his studio window overlooking St. Peter’s Square to wish crowds of tens of thousands of people below a Happy New Year.

But his New Year greeting was overshadowed by a man who scaled scaffolding around St Peter's Square and draped a banner calling on the Pope to 'Stop terrorism'.

The man identified himself on the banner as Julian Jungarean, a Romanian who has previously scaled the colonnade around the piazza.

Witnesses say uniformed officers were speaking with him from the ground and a nearby roof.

After a few hours of police negotiations, he came down and was escorted away.

The protest didn’t appear to cause the pope any disturbance.
