A market owner in New Jersey was busted Friday for allegedly running an over-the-counter heroin sales operation at his store in Pleasantville.

Stop and Save Market owner Kamran Khalid, 29, was hauled to jail on charges of possession and distribution of narcotics within a school zone, NBC 10 Philadelphia reported.

'It was an open-air narcotic market going on from inside the store,' Pleasantville police Capt. Rocky Melendez told the station. 

'He wasn’t really concealing the fact that it was right over the counter.'

Cops found a whopping 400 bags bags of heroin and a large amount of cash in his store, according to the station.

Police said they'd been investigating the store for three weeks. 

Customers were baffled.

'I was over there last week getting some items for dinner and I had no idea that that was going on,' James Owens, of Pleasantville, told NBC Philadelphia.

Officers busted the store owner in broad daylight to send a message to other drug dealers.

'This is about show and tell,' Mayor Jesse Tweedle Sr told the station. 'We show better than we tell. 

'Now they see that we’re for real.'

Local officials have shut down the Stop and Save Market and plan to revoke its license.

But Khalid's lawyer, Steve Scheffler, says the store is in his wife's name. 

'We’re a little disturbed as to why they would shut down the store,' Scheffler told the Press of Atlantic City.

The lawyer added that the Stop and Save Market is the main source of income for the family.

'She obviously has no involvement,' he told the newspaper. 

Customers who frequented the store were shocked to hear about the allegations
