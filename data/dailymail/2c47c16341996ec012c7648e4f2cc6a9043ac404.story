Sliding across a rope, her face tight with concentration, the young woman looks as if she is on a rigorous bootcamp.

In fact she is a tourist in Nabari, the birthplace of Japan's ninja, where visitors can pay for the pleasure of being taught in the ways of the ruthless feudal mercenaries.

Scurrying over walls, throwing deadly spiked darts, and walking across water in special ninja shoes were all vital skills used by the warriors to revolt against their samurai overlords, though how much use they are to tourists in 2013 is another matter.

Tourists who pay for the ninja training experience can learn how to throw shuriken - deadly darts which the warriors hid in their hands and used for slashing and stabbing

Nonetheless, such tricks are now being taught to enthusiastic visitors as Nabari, and its neighbouring town of Iga in Japan's Mie prefecture, use their ninja heritage to attract tourism and boost the local economy.

Ninja were most prominent in Japan in the 15th century, covert agents who specialised in unorthodox warfare using espionage, infiltration, sabotage and assassination.

Six centuries later, the warriors' skills are being used to boost the area's flagging economy.  Visitors to Nabari can buy a ninja training tour, which will teach them how to scale a 20ft wall, throw shuriken darts (concealed in the ninja' hand and used for stabbing or slashing) and cross rivers or ravines using ropes.

Tourists who manage to get through the course unscathed receive graduation certificates, while those after a less exhausting insight into the traditional warriors can visit Iga, an hour down the road, and watch a ninja display to learn how they garrotted unsuspecting victims.

Other attractions in Iga include an ancient shrine devoted to breaking up unhappy love matches, the beautiful white Iga Ueno Castle, and plenty of tourist shops offering traditional sweets and biscuits.

Iga and Nabari are known as the home of ninja because the first ever ninja were trained in the area in the early 15th century.  The mountainous nature of the region may have helped boost the secretive image of the feared warriors, most of whom belonged to either the Iga or the Koga clan.  The men from Iga were particularly renowned for their fearlessness and deadly skills.

Like the samurai, ninja were usually born into the profession, with youngsters picking up skills as they grew up.  As well as martial arts disciplines, young ninja learnt about survival and scouting techniques, about poisons, and how to administer first aid.

They did not always work alone - sometimes they would work together to form a human platform to scale a high wall, or they would dress the same to cause confusion as to who committed a crime.

Ninja were spiritual, believing not only in a personal power but also in the way of the Kami, a deity, and the Tengu, a race of birdlike spirits (half-man, half-eagle), said to inhabit forests in Japan.

Part of the Nabari ninja training experience includes learning how to scale walls - this tourist is perhaps having a little more help than the average 15th century warrior

Not all rigorous training: Tourists can sample traditional Japanese sweets in the town of Iga, though the deadly shuriken dart is a reminder of the violent ninja past

Iga Ueno Castle, also known as Hakuho or the White Phoenix Castle, was built from 1585 with the tallest walls of any castle in Japan to prevent enemies scaling them - a record that still holds today
