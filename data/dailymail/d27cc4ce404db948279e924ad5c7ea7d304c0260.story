As a qualified teacher, Ronny Deila will be more familiar than most with half-term reports. This lunchtime clash at Motherwell marked six months in the Celtic Park hotseat for the Norwegian — and an appraisal of his performance so far would make for positive reading, if noting a need for improvement.

On this evidence, Celtic will have no trouble in claiming their fourth-successive league title. It took a matter of minutes for them to carve open Motherwell here, with Anthony Stokes notching a simple goal after just six minutes.

But if Deila's side continue to be as wasteful in front of goal as they were against a lacklustre Well side, the manager can forget any dreams of an elusive domestic Treble. John Guidetti, in particular, was guilty of spurning a number of chances which kept the Steelmen firmly in the game.

It was Stokes' sixth league goal of the season, helping the Bhoys to their second win in just four days 

While Celtic still have great deal to do, though, they demonstrated at Fir Park that Scotland is still capable of classy, entertaining football, at least.

At the end of a tumultuous week in which a fair few home truths about the national game were laid bare, this meeting of last season's top two clearly exhibited Scottish football's strengths and flaws. Snooker, boxing and darts impresario Barry Hearn tore into the SFA while speaking at their annual convention on Wednesday — highlighting the lack of sponsorship, alcohol ban and dwindling crowds as key factors in the Scottish game's decline.

Yet Celtic boss Ronny Deila blasted back at the former Leyton Orient owner, standing up for the passionate atmosphere and exciting play he has witnessed during his brief tenure.

This match certainly delivered noise in spades — due largely to the vast sea of green behind one goal — yet there were still swathes of empty seats in the home sections amongst the 7,740 crowd.

This was in no small part to the disastrous start to the campaign endured by last season's runners up — a 1-1 draw at Parkhead in September was a meagre highlight in a campaign otherwise devoid of moments to savour.

Tempers flared somewhat when Celtic's Scott Brown (third left) squared up to Motherwell's Iain Vigurs 

It was a feisty affair and Celtic were on top of the game for the most part against a struggling Motherwell  

Since then the goals — and performances — have dried up, with managerless Motherwell winning just once in nine and scoring only six.

A run of five straight defeats drove Stuart McCall to call it a day and caretaker boss Kenny Black is yet to inspire a full-scale revival. Black has applied for the job although former Newcastle United midfielder Nolberto Solano has been strongly tipped to succeed McCall.

In the first-half here, the Steelmen appeared every bit as uncertain as their off-field issues with Celtic dominating from the off.

Having rubbished claims that Scotland was a long-ball nation in midweek, Deila practised what he preached as the Bhoys executed a passing masterclass — to the extent that even goalkeeper Craig Gordon resisted punting forwards in the opening 45.

They should have been in front almost immediately when Scott Brown threaded a perfectly-weighted through pass to John Guidetti. The industrious Swede raced clear but dragged his finish wide of the upright.

But Celtic made amends moments later as Stefan Johansen, pressing high up the park, won the ball on the edge of the box. The Celtic No10 rounded the onrushing Dan Twardzik and cut back to Stokes, who slotted comfortably past the two Well defenders on the line.

The hosts could not handle the combative Johansen and Nir Bitton — impressing in place of the injured Charlie Mulgrew — and Celtic soon created another opening. Bitton knocked the ball across to Brown, who instinctively let it run through his legs to James Forrest — taking Aleksandar Tonev's place wide right — in space to the right of the penalty area, but the winger could only fire wide.

It took 15 minutes for Motherwell to even string two passes together and, when they did, Iain Vigurs blasted high and wide from distance.

Moments later, Johansen was robbed by Vigurs on the far touchline and the midfielder embarked on a mazy run. Yet, with few team-mates in support, this rare glimmer of quality from the Steelmen proved futile.

Celtic then spurned yet another chance. This time Bitton fed Guidetti just outside the box, who tucked a neat backheel to Johansen which the Norwegian drilled straight at Twardzik.

Motherwell were forced into a change when right-back Fraser Kerr limped off and was replaced by David Ferguson.

Ramsden's lunge on Forrest left Motherwell with a huge task as they looked for a second half equaliser 

The visitors should have been 4-0 up at the break but could have gone in level when Motherwell fashioned a superb opportunity. Henrik Ojamaa found Josh Law out on the left and his drilled cross was touched behind before John Sutton could pounce.

The Steelmen continued to press after the break — Estonian playmaker Ojamaa blazed wide after Virgil Van Dijk and Bitton failed to clear their lines.

Despite lacking their first-half fluidity, the visitors still looked incredibly dangerous and Forrest almost doubled his side's advantage when his 18-yard shot was saved.

Yet Motherwell's task was made even more difficult when Simon Ramsden was dismissed midway through the second period for a reckless lunge on Forrest on the edge of the area.

Dead-ball specialist Guidetti could only find the Celtic supporters with the subsequent free-kick, but his side immediately sought to make their numerical prowess count.

The 22-year-old fluffed his lines once more — somehow stumbling Izaguirre's cross from the left into Twardzik — before the keeper made an astonishing stop to deny Forrest from only two yards out.

Black threw on Lionel Ainsworth and Lee Erwin and the substitutes came agonisingly close to snatching an unlikely leveller. Ainsworth swung an excellent ball in from the right which unmarked Erwin somehow nodded wide.

The striker was then booked for diving in a bid to win a penalty and Gordon, for the first time, launched his goal kick to safety.
