German legend Franz Beckenbauer has accused Bayern Munich stars of playing as if they had taken 'sleeping pills' in their midweek defeat by Porto.

The Bundesliga champions conceded twice in the opening 10minutes before losing 3-1 to the Portuguese in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday.

Der Kaiser may be a brand ambassador for the club but he couldn't hide his feelings after the game, when he criticised defender Dante for playing as if he were wearing 'ski boots' before turning on the entire team.

Speaking to reporters in New York to mark the club's new media agreement with MSN, Beckenbauer said: 'It was one of those days, all the players didn't show their real performance.

'After 10 minutes you are 2-0 down in the quarter-final in the Champions League, so many mistakes. I never saw this before. I thought they took sleeping pills! Porto were much faster, real power. It made me angry.

'If they played like that again, no chance [they can go through]. But they can win 2-0 or go to extra-time. They have a chance. Last year we had the same problem, playing excellent in the Bundesliga and then we had two bad days and were out of the competition.'

The 69-year-old did attempt to play down his comments over Dante's performance, he said: 'At half-time, I have to give a comment and that was my reaction. And I'm sorry to give him the ski boots... but he's Brazilian, and Brazilian to me means for me, technique and Pele and... Brazil. But not this.' 

'If you want to win the Champions League you need a strong league with a lot of players. Internationally, Bayern Munich belongs to the top teams but to win the Champions League… you saw the game probably two days ago, we are far, far away. With this performance, you don't win anything,' he added.
