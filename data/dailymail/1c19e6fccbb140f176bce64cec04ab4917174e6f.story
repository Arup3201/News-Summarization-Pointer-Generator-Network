A baby badger has been nursed back to health after it was brought in from the cold a home in a Jack Russell's jaws.

The tiny newborn has been named Little Star after the dog took it home to its owner in Derbyshire.

The woman noticed 'something pink in his mouth' and the little badger was dropped cold and wet onto her kitchen floor.

It appeared to be dead but was revived by the warmth of the woman's hand.

When she realised it was alive she contacted her local badger group, who quickly contacted Somerset's Secret World Wildlife Rescue where the baby badger is now thriving.

It had weighed only 80g when it was found by the woman - but is now gaining weight after being fed every two hours round the clock. 

This is the first orphan of the year for the wildlife rescue centre, which has years of experience in rearing cubs.

Secret World cares for more than 5,000 injured and orphaned animals every year.

Charity founder Pauline Kidner said: 'Badger cubs would not usually venture above ground until they are at least 10 to 12 weeks old, so this tiny badger is very lucky to survive.

'Despite being in an incubator, Little Star is so small and without her mum that an additional hot water bottle is needed to snuggle up to.'

Secret World will open the doors to the public for its first open weekend over the Easter weekend with a 'Badger Bonanza' theme.

The event is an opportunity to find out more about badgers and the work carried out at Secret World Wildlife Rescue.
