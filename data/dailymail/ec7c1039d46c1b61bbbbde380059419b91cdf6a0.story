With the final words of 'I regret nothing' a defiant Arizona killer who asked for no mercy, shunned a clemency hearing and railed against immigrants in his 1993 sentencing, was executed on Wednesday.

Thomas Kemp, 63, was put to death by lethal injection and declared dead at 10:08 a.m. local time inside the state prison in Florence, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, seven minutes after the execution began.

For his last meal Kemp had a cheeseburger, french fries, root beer, and boysenberry pie with strawberry ice cream.

Arizona executed Thomas Kemp on Wednesday for the 1992 kidnap and murder of a community college student. His last words were 'I regret nothing'

Kemp was sentenced to death in July 1993 for, along with an accomplice, snatching  for community college student Hector Soto Juarez from outside his Tucson apartment, taking him to a mine northwest of the city, and forcing him to disrobe.

Juarez, 25, was shot fatally in the head.

The former trailer park maintenance man has consistently showed no remorse about the killing, refusing to attend a hearing this month by the Arizona Board of Execution Clemency.

He branded the proceeding a 'dog and pony show.'

At his 1993 sentencing, Kemp said his only regret was not killing his accomplice and unleashed a tirade against Mexican immigrants and the legal system, saying his victim was 'beneath my contempt.'

'If more of them wound up dead, the rest of them would soon learn to stay in Mexico, where they belong,' Kemp said at his sentencing, according to court documents. 'I spit on the law and all those who serve it.'

Kemp and his partner, Jeffrey Logan, set the crimes in motion by buying a .380 semiautomatic handgun from a pawn shop days before the abduction. Late on July 11, 1992, the men took Juarez from the apartment parking lot.

At midnight, the two withdrew $200 with Juarez's bank card and drove him to the Silverbell Mine area.

Kemp walked his victim 50 to 70 feet from the vehicle, made him take off his clothes and then shot him twice, testimony showed.

Kemp and Logan drove to Flagstaff, Arizona, where they sold their now repainted vehicle and bought another gun.

The two then kidnapped a couple and forced them to drive to Durango, Colorado, where the husband and wife were sexually assaulted.

The couple escaped after driving to Denver, and Kemp and Logan soon separated. Logan was arrested after contacting Tucson police about the Juarez murder. Kemp was taken into custody at a homeless shelter in Tucson.

Kemp was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and armed robbery.

Kemp's execution was the third in Arizona this year and the 94th since 1910
