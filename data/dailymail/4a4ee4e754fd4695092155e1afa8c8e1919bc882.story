Struck off: Thomas Floyd was once seen as a champion of dental care for poor children due to his willingness to accept Medicaid

A pediatric dentist who last year pleaded guilty to abusing a four-year-old patient already had a string of accusations on his record spanning eight years, which included hitting children with dental tools, calling them names and performing unnecessary dental work, it emerged today.

Thomas Floyd, 62, from Florida, was arrested last September and, under a plea deal, was sentenced to five years probation and agreed to relinquish his dentist license.

Under the agreement, the state agreed not to pursue additional charges against Floyd from any other known victims from his former dental practice.

One of Floyd's former dental assistants told police the 62-year-old 
jammed a dental tool into four-year-old boy's mouth with such force that blood 
squirted out. 

Roger Zacharie told police last year: 'Blood squirted up. He'd slap again. Boom. "Open up".

'You know and then he's — he slapped one more time, which was the third slap. And I couldn't take it because blood squirted all on my shield and his shield.'

For most of his career, which spanned three decades, Floyd was seen as a champion of dental care for poor children due to his willingness to accept Medicaid.

But after a number of complaints of child abuse were lodged against him, the Department of Health launched an investigation.

They found that in 2011, during a seven-month period alone, Floyd allegedly called children names, including 'cry baby', 'ape' and 
'brat', pinched a two-year-old and gave a four-year-old eight crowns without her parents' consent.

The report also revealed the department received an anonymous complaint stating 
Floyd abused children in his office 'by putting his hand over their 
mouths and calling them names'.

Documents obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel detail a string of allegations going as far back as 2001 with similar accusations.

Claims: Children who were treated at Floyd's dental practice and their parents made various allegations over the last decade which included being hit by dental tools, being verbally abused and having healthy teeth extracted

One father said he took his child for a routine clean and check up and Floyd pulled three good teeth.

'It's horrifying that your daughter goes
in for a dental cleaning and comes out missing teeth,' the father
Benjamin Rodriguez told the Sun Sentinel. '[Floyd] just didn't care.'

Eight former employees told police they saw 
Floyd hit or become overly aggressive with crying and disabled children and would hit them with dental tools.

The most recent police inquiry came 
about in February 2012 when the mother of a seven-year-old girl reported to 
police that her daughter went to have four teeth extracted and came out 
with beads from her braids missing and her clothes wet.

Rovenia Gerald told the Sun Sentinel that Floyd had stuffed a 
dental bib in her daughter's mouth to stop her from screaming and told 
her, 'Shut up you damn brat!'

According to the investigation released by the Department of Health, 'Floyd’s behavioral control methods with his patients fall well below acceptable standards of practice in treating pediatric patients'.

Floyd's attorney said the allegations stem from disgruntled former employees and those of his ex-wife, who is an orthodontist.

Floyd himself said he was the victim of a 'witch hunt', in a letter he sent to the Florida Department of Health last year, and claimed his Medicaid patients who had severe dental, medical and behavioral problems oftentimes had difficult parents.
