PETR CECH LATEST

Queens Park Rangers have been offered Cech by Chelsea.

The goalkeeper, who has lost his place at Stamford Bridge to Thibaut Courtois, is believed to favour a move to a London club.

Chelsea do not wish to let him join a rival, in either the Premier League or Europe, but are keen to treat their legendary goalkeeper with respect.

MARCO VAN GINKEL LATEST

Chelsea youngster Van Ginkel completed a season-long loan deal to AC Milan, following in the footsteps on Fernando Torres.

Dutch midfielder Van Ginkel spent the majority of his first campaign at Stamford Bridge recovering from a cruciate ligament injury with Jose Mourinho eager for him to gain first-team experience.

The deal solves Chelsea's conundrum of having too many foreign players to comply with Premier League and Champions League squad regulations.

NATHANIEL CHALOBAH LATEST

Premier League newcomers Burnley are in talks with Chelsea over a loan move for their England under-21 midfielder Chalobah.

The 19-year-old has previously spent time on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough but Mourinho feels he is ready for a taste of the Premier League.

Chelsea already have 15 players on loan around England and Europe but Burnley will ask to see if they can continue to pay part of Chalobah’s reported £35,000-a-week wages.

FERNANDO TORRES LATEST

Torres's supreme fitness helped him break all previous records when undergoing his AC MIlan medical, boss Filippo Inzaghi has revealed.

Torres ended a disappointing three-and-a-half years at Chelsea after his £50m switch from Liverpool, when he completed a two-year loan deal with the Rossoneri.

And Inzaghi has revealed the Spanish striker has made an instant impact at the club before he has even kicked a ball with a 'new record' for medical tests.
