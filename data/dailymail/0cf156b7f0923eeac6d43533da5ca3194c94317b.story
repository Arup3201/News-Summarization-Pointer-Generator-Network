When you're small in stature, life can sometimes go over your head.

This was certainly the case for Pedro the Shetland pony, who at just 43in was unable to see over his stable door. 

But luckily for him, a group of local schoolchildren came to the rescue – by designing a special equine periscope.

Pedro the Shetland pony uses his 'Pedroscope' designed by schoolchildren to see over his stable gate

The cardboard contraption – nicknamed the Pedroscope – is fixed to the 60in gate and uses carefully placed mirrors to give 14-year-old Pedro a view of his yard.

It was built by printing firm Print & Cut, which heard about the idea through a volunteer.

Pint-sized Pedro was kindly given a home at Ebony Horse Club, in Brixton, London, last year as his height makes him perfect for small or disabled children to pet. 

Builders estimated it would cost thousands of pounds for a bespoke, miniature pad for Pedro - money the struggling charity do not have.

So instead local school children thought up a special cardboard periscope dubbed the 'Pedroscope' he can peek through – and enjoy watching his trotting stable-mates.

Letty Porter from the charity, which gives disadvantaged children the chance to engage with horses, said: 'We'd love to buy him a new miniature stable with a lower door. But this is a fun interim solution.'  

Yesterday a delighted Pedro used his 'Pedroscope' to view his friends and staff are now geeing themselves for the mammoth task of fundraising to build him a more size-appropriate home.

Funding manager Ms Porter said: 'Pedro spends lots of his time out in the paddock playing, so he has a wonderful life.

'But we'd love to buy him a new miniature stable with a lower door so he can look out and see what's going on when relaxing in his stable.

'While we raise the funds, we thought we'd ask local schoolchildren to make it their project to invent a fun interim solution.

'We were blown away by their ideas. Little did we know one conversation with a volunteer would lead to a company agreeing to build a full-size working 'Pedroscope'. We're so thankful to them.' 

Other ideas the children came up with included 'suspend him from a giant helium balloon', 'build a set of steps for his stable', 'cut a spy hatch into his door', and 'build him a very high straw bed.'  

Helper Grace Mpungi, 11, said: 'Pedro is so cute and our other horses love him. I'd never seen a horse in real life 'til I came to Ebony, never mind one as small as Pedro.'

Schoolboy Cameron Chapman, 15, who coined the name 'Pedroscope' added: 'We've been looking it up online and reckon it's the world's first pony periscope!'

Pedro eagerly attempts to get his bowl of feed being offered to him over his stable door by a helpful assistant 

Ebony Horse Club worker Tanya White, 25, said: 'For kids who have never seen a horse, they can be scary at first so Pedro's perfect for gaining their confidence.

'Last week he visited a school we work with where a number of students are wheelchair users. They loved him as he was so good with them.

'The children come to us through referrals from schools, police and social workers. Horse-riding gives them both an outlet and a direction in life.'

Alternative ideas thought up by schoolchildren  included 'suspend him from a giant helium balloon', 'build a set of steps for his stable', 'cut a spy hatch into his door', and 'build him a very high straw bed'

Riding instructor Sorrel Docherty, 24, said: 'The children have been really imaginative in coming up with ideas for Pedro's problem.

'I love the 'Pedroscope' and Pedro's just getting the hang of it. But really he would love a mini stable of his own.'

Martina Burrell, 37, mother of one of Pedro's young autistic carers Shay, said: 'I've grown up round Brixton and I can't believe we've got this community riding centre right on our doorstep.

'It's changed my son's life. He was recently diagnosed with Autism, never did any sport and finds it hard to make friends at school.

'But here, he's like a different child. I'm so grateful to Ebony.'
