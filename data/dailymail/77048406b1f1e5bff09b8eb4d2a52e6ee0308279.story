One of the greatest sporting rivalries in Australia's history is set to end as Ford has announced it will not renew it's deal with Bathurst champions Ford Performance Racing.

The move by the car manufacturer, which will see the removal of V8 Supercars from it's $60 million sponsorship deal, will end the infamous rivalry between the company and Holden by the end of 2015.

The unexpected move means that the upcoming Bathurst 1000 will be the second to last time the two long standing rivals with race against each other in the championship.

The iconic competition was made famous 22 years ago by the late Peter Brock and Dick Johnson. Johnson, a three-times winner of the Bathurst circuit, said that he believed die-hard fans would boycott the brand, reported The Daily Telegraph.

'It would be a disaster for the sport. From our point of view we need them here,' he said. 

It has been a week of surprises for Ford fanatics, with the manufacturer announcing the discontinuation of GT Falcon.

The announcement also follows on the closure of Ford's Australian factory, as the manufacturer confirmed in May that it would be ceasing production in Australia

V8 Supercars CEO James Warburton confirmed that the company will have two teams who will race Ford in 2015 'even if they will not be factory backed.'  

'We have consistently made our case to Ford, not only for 2015, but well into the future. They know exactly where we are going and the huge benefits we can deliver,' Warburton said.

'We would obviously love to have them continue in the sport.'

The manufacturer only has two teams left in the mix, the Ford Performance Racing team and Dick Johnson Racing, which has not had official sponsorship for the last six years.

'Growing up I always watched the Ford and Holden rivalry and was very proud to have cars made in Australia,' said Lowndes.

Holden's golden boy Craig Lowndes, who is celebrating 20 years at the Bathurst 1000, has released a limited edition Commodore ahead of Saturday's race, with the car costing $60,000. 

The car will go into production this week and all of the vehicles will be completed by the end of 2014, reported news.com.au. 

'Growing up I always watched the Ford and Holden rivalry and was very proud to have cars made in Australia,' said Lowndes.

'It was something I never thought would change. But of course times have changed and it’s going to be a very sad day to see Holden and Ford cease to be manufactured locally.' 

This weekend will see Mark Winterbottom representing Ford going head to head with Holden's Jamie Whincup in the 1000km blowout at Mount Panorama.
