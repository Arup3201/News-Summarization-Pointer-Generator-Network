A chef has created what could be the world's biggest pasty, measuring 70cm in diameter and shaped to look like the earth. 

The colossal creation, which took more than eight hours to make, is the brainchild of Tony Trenerry. 

The head chef at the Eden Project slaved over the snack to mark the beginning of the World Pasty Championships.  

A pasty on his shoulders: Eden Project Cornwall's head chef Tony Trenerry with his giant creation 

The giant pasty, which has no filling in it, had to be cooked in the biggest oven at the Eden Project in Cornwall. 

It was inspired by the Greek Titan Atlas who appears in numerous sculptures bearing a globe on his shoulders and will now go on display at the popular tourist destination.

To be called a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be a ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'.

It must contain sliced or diced potato, swede and onion, and the vegetable content must be at least 25 per cent of the whole pasty.

Diced or minced beef must account for at least 12.5 per cent. Seasoning is also required 'primarily salt and pepper'

Mr Trenerry, 44, said that his creation was the toughest - and heaviest - baking challenge he has undertaken in his 25-year career.

'I was inspired by the amazing collection of competitive pasties at last year's World Pasty Championships and wanted to do my bit to inspire entrants to this year's competition,' he said. 

'Word about the competition is spreading and, as well as local bakers, we have had interest from around the world, including enquiries from the US and Canada.'

Registration for the World Pasty Championships, also known as the Olympics of the Oggy, is now open.

Pasty lovers from around the world are invited to put their finest creations up on 28 February to be crowned Best Pasty in the World.

The competition sees amateur and professional bakers from far and near compete by baking traditional Cornish pasties or variations on the classic beef, onion, potato and turnip recipe.

Competition categories are split between those who would like to make a traditional Cornish pasty, which abides by strict guidelines and is made in Cornwall, and those who want to make any other type of savoury pasty. 

Makes two pasties  

Pastry ingredients: 225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting, pinch of salt; 50g lard, chilled and diced; 50g hard margarine, chilled and cut into cubes

Filling ingredients: One potato, peeled and thinly sliced; 50g swede, peeled and thinly sliced; 115g beef skirt or chuck steak, finely diced; quarter small onion, thinly sliced; salt and ground white pepper; beaten egg or milk to glaze. 

Method: To make the pastry, mix together the flour and salt and rub in the fats. 

Gradually stir in two to three tablespoons cold water and bring everything together with your hands to form a smooth, pliable dough. Divide the dough into two balls. 

Preheat the oven to fan 180C/400F/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. On a floured work surface, roll out one ball of dough and trim to form a circle about 20cm/8in across. 

Slightly off-centre of the circle, place a layer of potato, then a layer of swede. Add half the beef, then half the onion, then a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper. Finally, add another thin layer of potato, to stop the meat from drying out. 

Carefully fold the pastry over and crimp the edges together (using a little beaten egg to seal, if wished). Place on the lined baking sheet. Repeat to make the second pasty. 

Glaze with a little milk or beaten egg and make a small hole in the top. Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.
