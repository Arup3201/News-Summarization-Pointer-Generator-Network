Office workers up and down the country are proudly wearing the ugliest sweater in their wardrobe today. 

In the last few years, Christmas Jumper Day has become a big tradition in the UK, with participants donating £2 to Save The Children for wearing a festive garment to work.

But humans aren't the only ones getting in on the action this December 12 - pets across Britain are also wearing their finest festive garments.

Office workers up and down the country are proudly wearing festive sweaters today. Now pets getting in on the act, wearing Santa costumes, jumpers and elf hats. FEMAIL rounds up the best animal photos 

Cats, dogs, rabbits and even hedgehogs are wearing everything from Christmas ties, to Santa costumes and mistletoe hats. 

Pet company Drontal has compiled a selection of pets today, who are either looking suitably embarrassed in their gimmicky gear (much like their human counterparts), or very snug with their extra layers. 

But animal cosiness, charity aid and human entertainment aren't the only benefits from pets joining in with Christmas Jumper Day. 

Meredith Langley from South Carolina has made a full-time business out of knitting festive headgear for cats, modelled by her long-suffering pet Bullwinkle for her Etsy shop iheartneedlework.

Femail has rounded up some of the best photos of animals in Christmas clothing so far, including several crackers from Bullwinkle's photoshoots.

This paw little dog would rather be rid of his festive gear 

This pooch wouldn't look out of place in trendy east London with his knitted jumper 

What are you looking at? This cat is rightfully proud of its woolly sweater 

What the elf is on my head? Meredith Langley made this for her cat Bullwinkle 

Santa had better be stopping round this dog's kennel after it was made to wear this outfit 

This pet dog stands a much better chance of a spare drumstick while wearing that cute hat 

Bullwinkle is branching out in festive fashion with this Christmas tree hat 

Who wouldn't want a face lick from this cute mutt with this adorable mistletoe headband?

This cat looks very smart in a festive bow tie 

Next to the radiator AND under a fleecy Christmas hat, no wonder these rabbits look so cosy 

The first Gooner cat? The cats look pretty chuffed with their Christmassy neck attire 

And they were all outdone by an extremely festive hedgehog...
