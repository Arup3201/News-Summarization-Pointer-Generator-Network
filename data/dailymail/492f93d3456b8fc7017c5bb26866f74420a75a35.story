A police document signed by a young Adolf Hitler before he became a Nazi dictator noting his change of address in Vienna is being sold at auction. 

The 20-year-old Hitler described himself as a writer, when he completed the slip of paper in 1909. 

The document, from August 22, lists Hitler's address as Sechshauserstrasse 58/II which exists today as a café called Maxx.

The document, pictured, which was signed by Adolf Hitler, claimed that the future dictator was a writer

According to the auction house, Hitler was made homeless a few months after signing the document 

Adolf Hitler, pictured, was living in Vienna, Austria in August 1909 and was under severe financial pressure 

He stayed in the property, his third home in Vienna, for less than a month before being evicted because he was broke.

The Nazi dictator listed his occupation as Schriftsteller, meaning writer, on the 12-inch by 9-inch paper - which also features an official police stamp.

Sam Heller, from Nate D Sanders who are listing the item, said: 'After rejection by The Academy of Fine Arts, he led a transient existence as an impoverished and mentally unstable young adult.

'He ultimately became homeless about four months from the time of this document.

'Here, as Viennese law required, he registers a change of address with the government.

'He fills in all the fields of the partially-printed Meldzettel form in his hand, dating it 22 August 1909 and listing his residence as Room 21/ 58 Sechshauserstrasse, Vienna.

'Hitler lived at that address from August 20 to September 16, 1909.

'No further records exist until his application to the Asylum for the Shelterless in December of that year.

'There are tears and minor paper loss to the right corners and remnants of mounting to verso - but it is in very good condition.

'It is an historically important document filling in details of Hitler's transient life as a young adult - the "what if" time period, had his life pivoted in any other direction.'

The document is being sold by Los Angeles-based online auction house Nate D Sanders. Bidding on the document, which is on sale until December 16, starts at $25,000 

The company earlier auctioned Hitler inscribed 'Mein Kampf' volumes for more than $33,650.
