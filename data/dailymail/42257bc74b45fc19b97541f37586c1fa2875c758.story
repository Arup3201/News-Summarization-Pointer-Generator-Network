A six-year-old boy was finally diagnosed with a brain tumour after visiting doctors eight times, his mother repeatedly being told there was 'nothing wrong'.

Dale Zaporowski, now 12, underwent life-saving surgery and rounds of gruelling treatment before suffering a relapse three years later when doctors discovered another brain tumour.

Today his mother Jacqui Zaporowski, 52, urged parents to trust their instincts after being told by four different doctors 'nothing was wrong'.

She said: 'I knew there was something serious wrong with Dale when he was six as he was vomiting every morning.

Dale Zaporowski, now 12, was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of six. His mother Jacqui Zaporowski took him to see four different doctors, eight times and was repeatedly told 'nothing was wrong'

Dale, pictured with his parents David and Jacqui Zaporowski, had a life-saving operation to removing a 4cm tumour at the back of his head. Having recovered well from treatment at the age of six, he suffered a setback when in 2011 doctors revealed he had had a relapse, after finding a 3cm long tumour

'I took him to the doctor eight times in four months but they kept saying there was nothing wrong.

'I was made to feel like I was being an over-protective and silly mum.

'I
 would urge any parent in the same situation when they know in their 
heart that something is wrong with their child to trust their instincts 
and go to A&E.'

Mrs Zaporowski,  who lives in Preston, Lancashire, with Dale, her husband David, and their other children Michael, 24, Sadie, 23, and Daniel, 21, said: 'We first noticed that Dale wasn’t eating properly even though he had never been a fussy eater.

'Then Dale began vomiting in the mornings. He was being sick as soon as he woke up and then he was being sick at school as well and they would ring me to tell me.

'I saw four different doctors at the same surgery but I felt they had all spoken to each other  beforehand as before I had even spoken, they seemed to have made their mind up that there was nothing wrong with Dale.

'The doctors made Dale do things like touch his nose, balance on one leg and squeeze their hands and would tell me that everything was fine.

'But we knew there was something wrong.

'Dale was also not eating and it got to the point where all he was eating was cheese and crackers.

'But when I told the doctors this, they just said maybe he was a fussy eater, even though I knew he wasn’t.

'We noticed things like Dale walking down the stairs by just putting one foot forward instead of striding. His balance was also off.'

In the end, Mrs Zaporowski took Dale to A&E at Royal Preston Hospital in April 2008.

Dale's parents took their son to A&E despite reassurances from doctors that there was nothing wrong. His mother Mrs Zaporowski said repeatedly searching for her son's symptoms on the internet came up with the same answer each time, a brain tumour

After checking the pressure behind Dale’s eyes, they discovered there was a lot of pressure and told his family he needed a CAT scan.

Mrs Zaporowski, said: 'It was another week before Dale had the CAT scan and by this time, he was pretty lifeless. 

'Within minutes of the CAT scan, a doctor was called and there was shouting saying: "Get this child blue-lighted".

'We were in tears. We were terrified but also felt relief that someone was finally listening to us.

'I am just so glad we took Dale to A&E when we did. I think if we had left it any longer we would have lost him'

- Dale's mother, Jacqui Zaporowski

'I had known deep down that there was something serious wrong with Dale even though the doctors kept telling me there wasn’t.

'I had been Googling all his symptoms and I kept coming back with a brain tumour.'

Dale had emergency MRI scans at Pendlebury, the former children’s hospital in Manchester, and specialists told his family they had found something abnormal.

They found a huge mass at the back of Dale’s head and performed lifesaving surgery to remove a 4cm brain tumour.

Mrs Zaporowski, said: 'The surgery took hours and afterwards, the doctors told us everything had gone well.

'Dale was unable to move, speak, see, swallow or communicate in any way.

'It soon became apparent that Dale could not do anything apart from breathe.

Mrs Zaporowski has urged other parents to trust their instincts as she did with her son, adding: 'I am just so glad we took Dale to A&E when we did. I think if we had left it any longer we would have lost him'

'Doctors told us time would tell and that Dale would improve, but they could not say to what level.

'But Dale has amazed us all and he continues to amaze us every day. Doctors thought his speech might be impaired, but it has not.'

Symptoms caused by increased pressure in the skull:

Headaches - a dull and constant pain that sometimes gets worse when the person coughs, sneezes or bends over. The headache may be worse at night.

Nausea - this may be worst in the morning, it may also get worse if the person suddenly changes position.

Seizures - some people may experience muscle spasms such as the twitching of an arm or leg. Sometimes a person also briefly loses consciousness.

Drowsiness - some people with brain tumours sleep more and fall asleep during the day.

Vision and balance problems - changes to the sight, such as blurred vision, confusion and balance problems.

Symptoms caused by the position of the tumour:

Changes in personality and intellect

Speech problems, loss of sense of smell, weakness in one side of the body

Facial weakness, difficulty swallowing and a one-sided smileSource: Macmillan Cancer Support

Dale underwent 15 months of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiotherapy.

The cancer had spread down his spine and he was fed through a gastrostomy for about 18 months and had intensive physiotherapy every day.

However, just as the 12-year-old’s family began thinking the worst was over, in April 2011, doctors discovered Dale had suffered a relapse.

His mother recalled: 'I received a telephone call from the hospital asking me to go in the next day without Dale to speak to the consultant.

'I knew straight away that the brain tumour had come back.

'Dale had had an MRI scan only a few days before so I knew it must be bad news.

'Finding out Dale had suffered a relapse was horrendous.

'We had always been given the message that if Dale had a relapse, his chances were not good.'

Doctors discovered the second brain tumour was at the front of Dale’s head and was 3cm long.

After undergoing further treatment, Mrs Zaporowski said: 'He is now 12 and has his problems as a result of all the treatment he has had, but he is here and he is cancer-free.

'It is only now six years on that we are finally starting to feel some normality.

'I am just so glad we took Dale to A&E when we did. I think if we had left it any longer, we would have lost him.

'It is very difficult as you trust doctors so if they tell you everything is OK, you want to believe them.

'I would encourage any parent to trust their gut instinct and go straight to A&E if you believe there is something serious wrong with your child.'
