The New York Knicks were given a timely boost when their star player Carmelo Anthony boarded the flight to London for their game against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday.

Anthony has missed New York's last six games with a knee injury but is on course for an appearance at the O2 Arena this week after joining the team on their journey to England.

The Knicks landed at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday morning and will practice at the arena on Wednesday before the game on Thursday night.

New York certainly need a lift right now in the middle of a 15-game losing streak, and having their superstar on board for the trip to London will help.

Shortly after arriving, Anthony said: 'It’s great to be back. I have some wonderful memories here – winning gold with the US Men’s National Team at the 2012 Olympics and then playing for the Knicks at The O2 in 2013.

'The Olympics was one of the best experiences I’ve ever both on and off the court. I’ll always remember winning the gold medal here in London. The fans are great and I am looking forward to the game on Thursday.'

Tim Hardaway Jr added: “This is my first time in London. I am looking forward to the game and to getting a win. It will also be interesting to explore the city and the great tourist attractions. 

'Some of the guys were here in 2013 and so they’ll be able to show us around and their experience will be useful on Thursday night.'
