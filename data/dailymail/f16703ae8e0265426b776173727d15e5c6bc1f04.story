Sun damage? Mary Amber Moore, 32, of Buford, Georgia is charged with leaving her crying son, 5, wrapped in a towel in a 90 degree Kmart parking lot while she shopped Saturday

Mary Amber Moore, 32, was inside a Kmart Saturnday night when a passerby saw a young boy, draped in a towel, crying in a parked car with the windows rolled up.

Police arrived and found the car unlocked. The boy said his mother had told him to hid on the floor of the vehicle, covered, so no one would see him.

Police searched the Covington, Georgia Kmart. But when they found Moore, she was without identification.

She told the officers her license was in the car, in a pink bag.

When police looked in the bag, they say they found the ID along with a bottle of various prescription pills.

Moore,
reports Covington News, was prescribed the Adderrall in the bottle, a 
stimulant medication commonly prescribed to children suffering from 
attention deficit disorder.

She claimed the other pills of varying colors and shapes, were also Adderrall but they just looked different.

At some point, police placed the bottle of pills atop the car.

Moore reportedly somehow grabbed the pills and dumped them all into her mouth before police could stop her.

Popping in: Police found Moore in a Covington, Georgia Kmart. In her car police say they found a bottle of various pills, which Moore allegedly swallowed. She's now in jail and the boy is with family

They were unable to stop her from swallowing some of the pills.

Moore claimed she swallowed the pills because she was fearful of being charged with putting them in the wrong bottle.

Moore was arrested and taken to an area hospital after swallowing an unknown number of different drugs.

The
suspect was subsequently discharged and booked on charges of 
contributing to the depravation of a minor, obstruction of an officer 
and tampering with evidence.
