Stitch, a Devon Rex, has racked up more than 12,000 followers on the Thousand Faces of Stitch page

Stitch, a Devon Rex, has racked up more than 12,000 followers on the Thousand Faces of Stitch page - and he is named after the alien in the Disney film Lilo and Stitch.

Owner Darya Leon, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said: 'The majority of people who see Stitch or his photos always say he is strange looking, and most people call him ugly.

'And he is often compared to an alien.

'In fact that's where his name came from - as in Stitch from the Disney film Lilo and Stitch, because of his big ears.

'We bred Stitch and he wasn't supposed to stay with us.

'But when he got to about five-weeks-old I realised it would be impossible to say goodbye to him and so he stayed.

'He was the most fascinating little thing, with his unusual markings and adorable behaviour.'

The Thousand Faces of Stitch account features hundreds of pictures of the attention seeking moggy who does not appear to be bothered by his unfortunate looks.

Ms Leon said: 'Stitch was a curious little cat who always followed me around, and he started joining me in my studio'

'This gave me chance to practice different lighting techniques with him in exchange for his favourite shrimp treats.

'Before I knew it I had a whole portfolio of his photographs.

'Some of the images were hilarious and people suggested I should start a social media account for Stitch - I chose Instagram because of its concentration on imagery.

'I did it partly for a laugh, but also as a way of showing my work to potential clients who might be interested in pet and family photography.

'And to my surprise Stitch started to appear on blogs and websites in just a matter of days.

The photographer added: 'I did it partly for a laugh, but also as a way of showing my work to potential clients who might be interested in pet and family photography'

She added: 'Stitch loves being photographed, whenever he sees me pick up my camera he races ahead of me into my studio'

'Stitch loves being photographed, whenever he sees me pick up my camera he races ahead of me into my studio.

'The only problem now is that I cannot get rid of him - he just can't accept the fact he is not the only one who needs to be photographed.'

The other internet star Grumpy Cat - real name Tardar Sauce - became a celebrity in 2012 after her photo was posted onto Reddit.

She became a sensation after a series of YouTube videos went viral and now has her own range of merchandise, including toys and clothing.

Celebrity pet Grumpy Cat arrives at the MTV Movie Awards at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, America. But not even a best-selling book, a movie deal and her own ranges of food and coffee can cheer up this miserable moggy

She has a best-selling book, a movie deal and her own ranges of food and coffee - but she doesn't seem overly happy about it. 

Grumpy Cat’s seven-figure wealth is founded on her frown which has endorsed thousands of soft toys, Christmas cards, calendars, mugs, T-shirts and fridge magnets all bearing her delicate features.

The two year old Grumpy Cat  has the sort of fan base that would make a human celebrity weep — 116,000 followers on Twitter and 1.6 million fans on Facebook.

Thanks to a single photo posted on an internet site in 2012,  the world’s most feted feline now has her own manager, her own lawyer and a burly minder to keep fans from cramping her rather unique style during public appearances.
