Michael Gove was yesterday embroiled in a new war of words over showing Blackadder in schools – with one of the programme’s stars.

Sir Tony Robinson, asked to weigh in to the row over whether the TV comedy should be used in lessons about the First World War, branded Mr Gove ‘very silly’.

The actor, who played the hapless Baldrick in the long-running series, refused to accept Mr Gove’s claims that it would feed pupils ‘left-wing myths’ about the 1914-18 conflict.

Sir Tony Robinson, asked to weigh in to the row over whether the TV comedy should be used in lessons about the First World War, branded Mr Gove 'very silly'

Writing in the Mail last week, Mr Gove said: ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder as misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out of touch elite. Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.’

He said this portrayal served to belittle Britain’s role in what was a ‘just war’ to combat German aggression. The troops who fought and died showed ‘patriotism, honour and courage’, he said.

But yesterday Labour’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, a historian, called Mr Gove’s article ‘shocking stuff’.

And Sir Tony, a prominent member of the Labour Party who once sat on its national executive, said: ‘I think Mr Gove has just made a very silly mistake. It is not that Blackadder teaches children about World War One.

When imaginative teachers bring it in, it’s simply another teaching tool.

‘They probably take them over to Flanders to have a look at the sights out there, have them marching around the playground, read the poems of Wilfred Owen to them. And one of the things that they’ll do is show them Blackadder.’

He told Sky News: ‘To make this mistake, to categorise teachers who would introduce something like Blackadder as left-wing and introducing left-wing propaganda, is particularly unhelpful and irresponsible from a minister of education. It’s just another example of slagging off teachers.’

A spokesman for Mr Gove hit back, saying: ‘Tony Robinson is wrong. Michael wasn’t attacking teachers, he was attacking the myths perpetuated in Blackadder and elsewhere.

‘Michael thinks it is important not to denigrate the patriotism, honour and courage demonstrated by ordinary British soldiers in the First World War.’

Blackadder Goes Forth is set in the trenches of the Western front in 1917, and focuses on the increasingly desperate attempts of Captain Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson, to avoid the action.

Speaking ahead of the centenary of the outbreak 
of the Great War Mr Gove said only 'undergraduate cynics' would say 
soldiers had fought in vain

He receives little help from his sidekick Private Baldrick.

In his article Mr Gove, who has been defended by some historians, said the effect of such programmes is that ‘our understanding of the war has been overlaid by misunderstandings and misrepresentations which reflect an at best ambiguous attitude to this country and at worst an unhappy compulsion on the part of some to denigrate virtues such as patriotism, honour and courage’.

Britain is preparing to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war in a series of events costing £50million.

Labour’s Mr Hunt claimed in The Observer that the Government was using the centenary to ‘rewrite the historical record and sow political division’ and accused the Tories of being ‘crass’.

He added: ‘Whether you agree or disagree, after the deaths of 15million people during the war, attempting to position 1918 as a simplistic, nationalistic triumph seems equally foolhardy – not least because the very same tensions re-emerged to such deadly effect in 1939.’
