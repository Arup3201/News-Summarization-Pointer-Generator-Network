A St. Louis man has been charged  with making threats against police and the St. Louis City Justice Center on Twitter.

Jason Valentine, 35, faces 10 felony counts of making a terrorist threat, the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office said on Thursday.

Valentine is being held on a $100,000 cash-only bail, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which did not specify which jail. 

Charged: Jason Valentine, 35, allegedly sent a slew of tweets threatening to 'kill a pig' in St Louis

It wasn't clear from online court records whether he has an attorney or when his first court appearance would be.

Valentine allegedly tweeted about 'Kill a pig Night' throughout December, the probable cause statement said, and that he threatened an explosion at the Justice Center on Wednesday.

'St. Louis City Justice Center Mysteriously Exploded 12/31/2014,' one tweet read, according to the statement. 

Another said, 'New Years Eve Massacre Kill A Pig Night.'

Many of the alleged tweets mentioned Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black 18-year-old was shot and killed by a white police officer in August.

The incident spurred local and nationwide protests in the following months.

Prosecutors also said in the statement that Valentine's tweets alluded to Vonderrit Myers, a black 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a white, off-duty St. Louis city police officer in October. 

Police contend Myers opened fire on the officer first, though Myers' family has disputed that.

Valentine's Twitter account has been suspended.
