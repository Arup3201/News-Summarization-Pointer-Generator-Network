A beach walker threw what he thought was a stone for his dog to fetch yesterday only to discover that it was in fact a live wartime grenade.

By chance, an off-duty military explosive expert was also on the seafront at Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex, and recognised what the barnacle-covered 'stone' actually was.

Police put up a cordon while they waited for a bomb disposal team to deal with the find.

Wartime grenades similar to those that have washed up on the seafront at Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex

It is the fifth Second World War grenade to wash up on the same beach over the last five weeks.

Twenty four hours before yesterday's discovery another grenade was discovered less than a quarter of a mile away.

Inspector Paul Butcher of Essex police said anyone who finds a grenade should call police immediately and stay well clear of the explosive.

He said police believe the grenades may have been in a crate that ended up in the sea during the war and that it 'might now be breaking up or has been disturbed by dredging work in the area'.

In the last five weeks, five grenades have washed up along the beach at Dovercourt, above

Inspec Butcher said: 'The result is that these five devices have all been washed ashore on the same stretch of the bay so we are asking people to be vigilant if they go onto the beach and dial 999 if they find any of these devices.

'Some have been covered in barnacles but the one found on Saturday looked almost like new despite the fact it had been in the sea for many years.'

The grenades have all been taken away by the Army's explosive experts and destroyed in controlled explosions on the beach.
