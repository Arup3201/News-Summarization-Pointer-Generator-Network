In 2003, a Pew Research Center survey found that roughly 50-percent of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of homosexuals, while only 38-percent of the country viewed them favorably.

One decade - and several landmark victories for gay rights - later, and those numbers have shifted dramatically.

According to a new PRC survey, the percentage of Americans who view gay men favorably has gone up by 18-percent to 51-percent, while the percentage of those who view lesbians in a favorable light has increased 19-percent to 58-percent.

The survey also finds that there are wide racial and educational differences in regards to opinions about why people are homosexual.

Overall, though, 42-percent of Americans think that being homosexual is a choice - a lifestyle that gay men and women decide to lead.

Of those who feel that being homosexual is a choice, a larger percentage of African-Americans (66-percent) believe people choose to be gay than any other group, followed by White evangelicals, with 62-percent.

According to the survey, education plays a large role in whether people believe being homosexual is a choice - 48-percent of Americans with a high school degree or less believe it's a choice, while 43-percent of those who've attended some college believe people choose to be gay.

Further education yields an even smaller percentage of Americans who think people choose to be gay, with 36-percent of those with a college degree believing people choose to be gay, and only 27-percent of those with a post-graduate degree.

Amongst all groups, only 8-percent of Americans think that being homosexual is the result of a person's upbringing.

Higher learning: according to the survey, the more education a person has, the less likely they are to believe that being homosexual is a choice

The survey also found that most of those who accept homosexuals believe that being gay is something people are born with, and not a decision a person makes.

According to the survey, of those who accept homosexuals, 58-percent believe that people are born gay, while only 30 percent think it's a choice. Only 6-percent of those who accept homosexuals think being gay is a result of a person's upbringing.

The survey is comprised of telephone interviews of 1,504 adults in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It has a 2.9-percent margin of error.
