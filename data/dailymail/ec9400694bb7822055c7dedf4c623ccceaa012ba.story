This fearless daredevil must have his head in the clouds - as he bravely edges across a highline a stomach-churning 3000ft above the ground outside Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

Andy Lewis can be seen in these incredible images carefully moving forward inch by inch across the thin wire with the breathtaking backdrop of fluffy clouds and a magnificent glowing skyline behind him as the sun sets.

In a different photo Andy, who has been slacklining and BASE jumping for the past 10 years, crosses another line without even wearing a harness - and only water and rocks below him if he falls.

The incredible images were taken this year on a trip to Brazil with friends who call themselves the Moab Monkeys - after the famous Utah desert - and includes some of the world's top slackliners.

Andy, from San Francisco, USA, said: 'I'm really confident with my abilities on the slackline so when I stroll across it almost doesn't look that hard.

'The better you get the more effortless it looks so people sometimes struggle to understand the technical aspect and the skill behind it.

'It's really painful to balance on the tops of your ankles like that and takes years to build up the strength needed be able to do it.

'A lot of the time doing what I do means if I lose balance I either catch the line or die - it's that simple but it makes you feel free having so little choices up there.

'If I were to lose my balance it would take a lot for me to miss the line.'

Photographer Scott Rogers, originally from Denver, Colorado, risks his own life to capture Andy's spectacular stunts but insists the group are skilled enough to do what they do.

He said: 'On a scale of one to ten highlining really is quite safe if you set up properly. But when you do it without a leash the danger level dramatically rises.

'We're all experienced so like to think the risk is fairly low however we accept the consequences are very high - sometimes death if a fall freesoloing or with the ankle leash slipping off.'
