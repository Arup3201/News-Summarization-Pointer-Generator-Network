Earlier this week, supermodel-turned-actress Suki Waterhouse revealed the secret to achieving her perfectly-tousled red carpet-ready hair: washing her tresses with Coca-Cola. 

During an interview with US Weekly, the British-born 23-year-old, who is currently busy promoting her new sci-fi thriller Insurgent, admitted that she rinses her hair with the popular soda because it gives her hair the perfect amount of volume and texture, saying: 'I don't like my hair when it's washed - it's fine and limp - but Coca-Cola makes it tousled, like I've gone through the Amazon or something.' 

As someone who has always suffered from slightly limp, lifeless hair, I was overjoyed to hear that there might be such an easy - if not slightly bizarre - fix to my haircare woes and I couldn't wait to give it a go.

Having bought two cans of Coca-Cola at a nearby store - unfortunately they were all out of bottles - I made my way home, all the while trying my best to warm up the cans so as not to have to shower myself in freezing cold Coke.

As Suki wasn't particularly clear about what method she prefers when it comes to rinsing her hair with fizzy soda, I did some research online to see whether there was a general consensus about the easiest and most effective way to use Coca-Cola as an alternative to shampoo. 

I admit I was quite surprised to see that Suki's cola theory seems to have a lot of support from various outlets online; along with advice on how to use the beverage in order to clean your windows and remove rust from metal, there were several Coke-based haircare tips.

And while some articles suggested using the soda as a pre-shampoo rinse, the majority claimed that using Coca-Cola as your only 'haircare' product would produce the best results, prompting me to abandon my beloved Serge Normant shampoo in favor of my cans of cola. 

Sadly, my many attempts to warm up the cola cans under the warm water in the shower failed, so when it finally came around to dumping the stuff over my head, it was still fairly frosty; certainly not the most enjoyable pre-bedtime experience.

It is highly likely that I'm also far less coordinated and graceful than Suki, who boasts years of red carpet and catwalk experience, but I found the logistics of the whole Coca Cola rinse to be really quite tricky.

First of all, the soda - predictably - fizzes everywhere and I was left with several sticky brown splashes of cola in my bath which, although not a complete disaster, was just a bit of a pain. 

Secondly, the cola didn't go exactly where I wanted to, and I actually ended up with a large amount of the first can's contents in my eye and on my face. Again, not the most pleasant of experiences. 

Let's just say, it was a good thing I had bought two cans because the first was, in all honesty, a total waste. 

However, when I finally managed to get the cola in my hair, I can't say it was that unpleasant a sensation; other than the slight chill, it really didn't feel that different to washing my hair normally. It wasn't nearly as sticky as I had imagined it would be, and I really couldn't feel any 'fizziness' on my head. Plus, I thought the scent was really quite enjoyable. 

When it came to rinsing the cola out with water however, I was incredibly careful to ensure that it was all gone - call my crazy, but the idea of having sugary sweet and sticky hair just wasn't too appealing, and I admit I was quite concerned about being attacked by swarms of flying insects confusing my hair for a sweet snack. 

After the cola rinse, and the subsequent water rinse, I left my hair alone, wanting to see exactly what the soda would do to it, without any additional styling products. I gave it a once over with the hair dryer and then headed to bed.

When I first woke up, I have to say I was quite impressed with how soft my hair felt. 

I had been really worried that my tresses would have transformed overnight into cola-encrusted dreadlocks and was thrilled to see that my hair still looked relatively normal. 

Additionally, there was a bit of extra bounce to it, particularly at the roots. 

However, after brushing it through properly, my hair looked really rather greasy - yes there was some texture in the roots, and some added volume through the lengths, but my slick-looking style just made it look as though I had failed to wash my hair in days. 

Granted, it wasn't the worst look in the world, but it certainly didn't come anywhere near to the perfectly-tousled, textured tresses that Suki was showcasing on the red carpet at the recent New York premiere of Insurgent. 

I think perhaps from now on I'll stick to shampoo - and perhaps invest in a good volumising hairspray.
