Fox 29 anchor Kerry Barrett has welcomed her first son into the world, following several tragic miscarriages.

John Jay Barrett IV was born over the weekend and weighed a healthy 6lbs 15oz.

He is Mrs Barrett's second child with husband of 11 years, John, a pilot with New Jersey National Guard, following three-year-old daughter Avery.

Last November, after much anguish, Mrs 
Barrett broke her silence on the evening news and spoke of suffering 
repeated miscarriages - four of which she detailed.

'For most of the last year and a half - I've been pregnant, and miscarried every single time,' she revealed to Fox News.

Her second miscarriage started just half an hour before she was due to go on air for the 10 'o clock news, and none of her colleagues knew she was pregnant, so stoically, Mrs Barrett went on with the show. She lost the baby at home later that night.

'You have the first and then the second 
and now we are in phase where maybe we aren't able to have [more] kids,'
 her husband admitted at the time.

The couple, heartbroken but determined not to give up, sought help from Dr Scott Edwards, a fertility specialist at Pennsylvania Hospital.

No abnormalities were detected and both parents were found to be healthy and normal, news Mrs Barrett found 'difficult to wrap her head around'. The hopeful mother was put on a course of drugs to hyper-stimulate her ovaries, and immediately fell pregnant again - this time with twins.

Heartbreak: Mrs Barrett went public with her struggles last November on an evening news special, speaking of her repeated miscarriages over the space of a year and a half

Raw: The new mother started having her second miscarriage just before going on air for her 10 'o clock news segment, which she finished, before losing her baby at home later that night

When the first ultrasound found the 
embryos to be on the small side, Mrs Barrett admitted that she felt 
somehow responsible. Hypothesizing it was because she hadn't been eating
 enough, she drastically upped her food intake.

'I stuffed myself thinking it was my fault that the babies weren't growing,' she revealed. 'And then when we went back the next week, they hadn't grown anymore and the heartbeats had stopped.'

This time, she had to have the fetuses surgically removed, and subsequent tests showed the babies had a relatively common chromosomal abnormality called Triosomy 18.

Marriage strain: Mrs Benett admitted there were times during this awful period where she and her husband were having 'the worst fights' they had ever had

Happy family: The couple describe little Avery (pictured as a toddler) as 'our most exciting adventure, our biggest teacher and our greatest accomplishment'

Months of spending 'far too much money' 
on various supplements and forms of acupuncture followed, and hours 
spent in the middle of the night crawling the internet for more answers.

She admits that the repeated the blows put an enormous strain on her marriage, recalling some of the 'worst fights' they had ever had; Mr Barrett finding it hard to watch his wife in so much pain, and Mrs Barrett feeling completely out of control of her body.

Dr Edwards assured them that even following several miscarriages, there can still be a '50, 60, 70 per cent' chance of success in the future - and he was right.

In August of last year, Mrs Barrett got pregnant again and this time carried the baby to full term.

Little John Jay will join his sister Avery, who the joyful parents describe as 'our most exciting adventure, our biggest teacher and our greatest accomplishment.'
