Jenson Button’s future will finally be revealed by McLaren at a press conference on Thursday morning.

The driver has widely been expected to end his 15-year career in Formula One, with chairman Ron Dennis and racing director Eric Boullier both at least initially preferring to partner the incoming Fernando Alonso with their other driver, Dane Kevin Magnussen.

But McLaren’s perplexing delay in confirming their driver line-up for 2015 has given rise to speculation that Button, 34, could be saved.

Jenson Button will find out if he has been retained by McLaren for the 2015 season on Friday

Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will re-join McLaren from Ferrari having left in 2007

Button’s irritation with the windy process has been felt keenly by others within the team. One mechanic was overheard saying: ‘When will Ron make up his f****** mind?’

Dennis refused to be chivvied to a decision – a bloody-mindedness that cost the team ill-will with some of the public.

Thursday’s unveiling at the McLaren’s Woking factory will trumpet their new associations with both Honda and double world champion Fernando Alonso, 33, who returns from Ferrari to the team where he spent a turbulent year in 2007. 

Mika Hakkinen, a double world champion with McLaren, told Swiss newspaper Blick that 'what is happening at McLaren is unworthy of such a team'.

British Racing Drivers' Club president Derek Warwick claimed to the BBC McLaren's treatment of Button has been 'disgusting'. 

Button's 2014 team-mate Kevin Magnussen is also waiting to hear his fate on Thursday

Dennis held a board meeting last Thursday with two other primary shareholders in TAG co-owner Mansour Ojjeh and Mahmood Hashim Al Kooheji, CEO of Mumtalakat, Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund. 

It has since taken Dennis the last few days to finally arrive at a conclusion, ending the agonising wait for Button and Magnussen.

Only last week Button said: 'I just want to get it done. I want to hear the decision as we all do so we can all move on in whatever direction.'

At stake is Button's 15-season F1 career, although it is understood he has irons in the fire should Dennis opt for  Magnussen.

Button won the world title with Brawn back in 2009 and has been at McLaren since 2010

The 34-year-old Briton is lined up for a seat in the World Endurance Championship, with Toyota understood to be leading the pursuers.

Button said: 'I'm now really comfortable, and whatever happens I will have a great year next year.

'New challenges are exciting, whether it's in Formula One with McLaren alongside an exciting team-mate, or whether it's elsewhere.'
