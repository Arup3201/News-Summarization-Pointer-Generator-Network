Incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has promised an inquiry if the upcoming tour to face a 'mediocre' West Indies side does not go to plan.

England's Test team are third in the world and are expected to return from the Caribbean with a success, which would be the ideal preparation ahead of an Ashes summer.

A Test series boost will also go a long way in restoring faith in the coaching staff - head coach Peter Moores in particular - who have come in for criticism after the World Cup group-stage exit.

Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves vows an inquiry if England don't beat West Indies in their Test series

England coach Peter Moores is under pressure after England's disastrous World Cup 

However, Graves has sounded a grim warning should Alastair Cook's team fail to beat West Indies, especially as the islanders will be be losing the likes of Chris Gayle to Twenty20 franchises in India.

'If we don't win, I can tell you now there will be some inquiries of why we haven't,' Graves told BBC Radio Leeds.

'I'd certainly be disappointed if we don't win the West Indies series, because I am pretty sure the West Indies are going to have a mediocre team.

'A lot of their stars are going to be playing in the Indian Premier League anyway, not in the Tests, so we should win that series.'

Graves is due to start his job at the ECB in May, amid reports of a potential international return for Kevin Pietersen, with the exiled batsman hopeful of first signing for an English county.

But before all of that, Graves accepts the board has to start getting back to its roots.

With Tom Harrison having taken charge as the new chief executive, Graves added: 'I think we've been seen as a governing body who might have been a bit aloof or a bit away from the coal face.

'I want to get back to the coal face, and our new chief exec is of the same opinion. That's top of the list.

'We want to be open, transparent and we want to work with the counties and everybody else, all the stakeholders, to make sure that we are doing the right thing.'
