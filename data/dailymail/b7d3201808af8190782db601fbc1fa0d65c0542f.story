An entertaining university student took home $100,000 from game show Hot Seat Millionaire on Monday night without being certain of a single answer to any of the questions.

Khaled El-Katateny, a second year law student from Melbourne, was calm and more than a little cheeky, as he joked with host Eddie McGuire and plugged his Instagram page in between each round.

'I'd buy 10 jet-skis, for me and all my friends... I'd have my name on the side', he revealed when asked what he would spend the jackpot on if he won.

El-Katateny made it seem as though he was making his way blindly through the six questions which saw him leave the show with $100,000, but the 19-year-old said he had a a plan from the beginning.

He attributed his win to his ability to read body language, and said his strategy involved repeating the answers back to McGuire to gauge his response.

'I didn’t play the game — I played the man,' he told news.com.au. Though it is entirely possible this admission is just another part of the performance which kept viewers entertained throughout.

El-Katateny had the audience in stitches the whole time he was in the chair, cracking jokes and jumping between options before locking in one of the multiple choice answers in a seemingly random manner.

The prankster joked his way through the questions, and proclaimed each time one popped up on the screen 'I have no idea'

Each time a question popped up on the screen, his reaction was the same: 'I have no idea.' He even asked McGuire 'if I win or lose can I take a selfie?'

The first question he was asked who Nicholas Cowdery was, a man well-known for his work in law, the field which El-Katateny is studying in.

Before he answered he cheekily proclaimed in a hilarious act of self-promotion 'Wouldn't have a clue, it kind of reminds me of my Instagram name Khaled_ELK,'  as he stared straight down the barrel of the camera.

When it got to the $100,000 question and McGuire quipped that the law student hadn't been certain of any answer so far, the 19-year-old was quick to respond.

El-Katateny said early in the program he would buy 10 jet-skis for him and all his friends if he won the money

'Maybe I make you think that I don't know the answers', El-Katateny said with a straight face, sending the audience into fits of laughter once again.

The final question asked who the artist behind 1908 masterpiece The Red Room was, and the Melbourne man nearly went with Vincent van Gough because 'I know he's popular.'

At the last second he locked in Henri Matisse, and had a very good reason for doing so.

The 19-year-old appeared to guess each answer, but said he was actually reading host Eddie Maguire

'If you wanna know my thought process it's like I haven't done D in a while so I'll choose that.'

Whether he was lucky or just much smarter than he let on, the 19-year-old still left up the show with much more money than he came with.

However he admitted he might stick to just one jet-ski instead of 10, as his previous promise was causing some trouble between his friends.

The Melbourne man made sure to plug his Instagram page and ask for a selfie with Eddie McGuire while on TV
