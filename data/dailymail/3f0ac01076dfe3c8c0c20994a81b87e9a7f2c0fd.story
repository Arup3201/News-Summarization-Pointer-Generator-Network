It may have been her father's big night but three-year-old Carina Victoria Castro wanted to make sure all eyes were on her.

The daughter of San Antonio Mayor Julian 
Castro put on a top hair-flipping performance as cameras panned to her 
during her father's speech at the Democratic National Convention on 
Tuesday.

As he recounted taking his 
only daughter to her first day of pre-K a few weeks ago, the youngster 
was paying more attention to looking her best than his heartfelt story.

Rising star: As her father, Texas Mayor Julian Castro, took the stage at the DNC, three-year-old Carina Victoria Castro let the crowd know just how good she could look by repeatedly flipping her hair

What a performance! The youngster's show garnered thousands of fans across the internet

Castro recalled the tender moment 
when he whispered, 'Que Dios te bendiga', or 'May God bless you', to his
 daughter as she left for school, while cameras focused on her next to 
her mother.

Seeing herself on screen, the 
youngster wasted no time in primping herself for her viewers, repeatedly
 throwing her long dark hair over her shoulders and clutching her face.

Millions watched, entranced from home - and took to Twitter to note their admiration.

'Eat your heart out, Suri Cruise,' 
Katy Graham said, referring to the six-year-old daughter of Katie Holmes
 and Tom Cruise. 'Carina Victoria Castro is the new It Girl in town.'

'Carina Victoria Castro will either 
be a lady US President in like 2045, or America's Next Top Model, cycle 
32,' Robin Reed added.

'Carina Victoria Castro for Secretary of the ADORABLE,' Kevin Pang quipped.

While the younger Castro was no doubt
 the star of the show, her father was also well-received by Democrats as
 he addressed the Convention on Tuesday night.

During an impassioned keynote speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, Castro attacked Mitt Romney's stance on immigration as the result of a party that 'doesn't get it'.

The 37-year old, a rising star in Texas but little known on the national stage, roused the packed audience at the Time Warner Center by claiming that 'Mitt Romney, quite simply, doesn't get it.'

Mr Castro's tale was in part standard political fare for a party seeking to solidify its standing among immigrant voters.

Raised by a single mother born in the U.S. and a grandmother who had emigrated from Mexico, Mr Castro and his identical twin brother Joaquin achieved happiness and success through hard work and a good education made possible by the American dream.

But from there, he pivoted to an assault on Republican Mr Romney, whose policies Mr Castro said would 'dismantle' the middle-class if elected.

He said: 'We know that in our free market economy some will prosper more than others. What we don't accept is the idea that some folks won't even get a chance.

'And the thing is, Mitt Romney and the Republican party are perfectly comfortable with that America.'

Keynote speaker: Mr Castro taunted Mr Romney for his shifting positions on issues like abortion rights, gay marriage and his own push for universal health care as governor of Massachusetts

He added: 'I don't think Gov Romney 
meant any harm. I think he's a good guy. He just has no idea how good 
he's had it,' - a pointed jab at Mr Romney's considerable wealth.

Mr Castro
 also taunted Mr Romney for his shifting positions on issues like 
abortion rights, gay marriage and his own push for universal health care
 as governor of Massachusetts.

He said: 'Gov Romney has undergone an extreme makeover, and it isn't pretty.'

The Romney campaign shot back at Mr Castro's claim the GOP presidential nominee is insensitive to the middle-class.

Spokesman Ryan Williams said: 'Middle-class families understand that they are not better off than they were four years ago because President Obama's liberal policies have failed to turn around the economy.'

Until now, Mr Castro has enjoyed a spate of favourable media profiles, a landslide re-election last year and speculation about whether he'll become the governor of Texas or even the country's first Hispanic president. His well-received turn at the convention all but guarantees more of such chatter.

He was introduced onstage his brother Joaquin, a Texas state legislator from San Antonio now poised to win election to Congress in November

Julian Castro said: 'My family's story isn't special. What's special is the America that makes our story possible.

'Ours is a nation like no other, a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation. No matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward.'
