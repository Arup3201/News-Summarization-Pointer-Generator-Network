A Minnesota radio host has sparked an online firestorm after he said live on air that he'd like to tell the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting victims to 'go to hell' for infringing on his rights to own a gun.

Bob Davis, one half of the outspoken 'Davis & Emmer,' show on Twin Cities News Talk AM, was discussing gun control when he made the outrageous comment about the Newtown, Connecticut tragedy earlier this month.

'I'm sick and tired of seeing these victims trotted out, given rides on Air Force One, hauled into the Senate well, and everyone is just afraid -- they're terrified of these victims,' he said. '... I would stand in front of them and tell them, "Go to hell."'

The horrific shooting on December 14, 2012, left 26 people dead, including 20 six or seven-year-olds.

Davis' heinous rant, which begins just over six minutes into the above segment, was targeted at the victims' families, some of which have been vocal in the months since the shooting as advocates for tighter gun controls.

'I have something I want to say to the victims of Newtown, or any other shooting,' Davis said, according to Minneapolis' City Pages blog.

'I don't care if it's here in Minneapolis or anyplace else. Just because a bad thing happened to you doesn't mean that you get to put a king in charge of my life. I'm sorry that you suffered a tragedy, but you know what? Deal with it, and don't force me to lose my liberty, which is a greater tragedy than your loss.'

The remarks prompted scores of angry comments from shocked listeners, with most claiming the hosts were 'despicable' and should be 'ashamed' of themselves.

One listener wrote on their web page: '(This is the) most unbelievably insensitive thing I have heard, I will NEVER listen to this station again and will encourage all my friends and acquaintances to do the same.'

Another wrote: 'Davis and Emmer and your station should be ashamed of the callous stance taken about guns and Newtown. Two angry men, who also care nothing for the pain their words cause. No one is bothering your "liberty" nor do you have a "king." Two immature men who seem smugly satisfied with the venom they spew. I hope your sponsors bail on you as fast as they can and your show vanishes. You help nothing with your hate.'

A few days after the vicious tirade, Davis addressed his outraged listeners, but stopped short of an apology.

'... here's what you need to know and what some of you already know about me is that, ah, this is not a contrived show, I do not hide behind flowery language I do not pull my punches, when I'm passionate about something it comes out on the air, it's real and it will always be that way,' he said.

He then characterized his comment as 'an emotional predecessor to a thought which can and will find a more refined expression by me and others in the future, I guarantee you.'
