More mothers have weighed in on the debate over whether being bored playing with your children makes you a bad parent.

Catherine Cooper and Denise Sumpter appeared on today's This Morning to reveal their conflicting views.

Mother-of-two Catherine, a freelance journalist based in South West France and London, said it's natural for adults to find the repetitive nature of children's games a complete bore.

Debating the issue: Denise Sumpter, left, and Catherine Cooper - both mothers of two - on This Morning

She said: 'You're a grown woman, with different interests to a child. Small children love repetitive games. It might be delightful to play peek-a-boo at first but not 300 times later.'

Catherine, whose children are now 10 and 12, said she's glad the issue is finally being debated as it's something she never felt she could not admit when hers were small.

'I felt guilty when my children were babies as I assumed everyone else was having a wonderful time,' she said.

She added: 'One of my son, Toby's, favourite games when he was little was to stand up in a tube which he wanted me to hold up - I defy anyone to find that interesting.'

But mother-of-two Denise Sumpter said she would. 

Arguing the other side of the case on the ITV daytime show, she said: 'I find the different ways my children interpret things so interesting. The way they can see something different in a pen or a piece of paper or a cardboard box.

Duty to play along: Repetitive games is when children learn and develop

'I'm fascinated by what my child does on an iPad, they play games on there I don't know how to work.'

Denise, 44, from North London, who has a six-year-old daughter Belle and son Beau, 19 months, said parents should put aside how they feel about 'boring' games because taking part is helping their child learn and develop.

She said: 'It's boring from the perspective of an adult but our children rely on us to nurture them and move them forward.'

She added that if mothers are bored playing with their children at home, there are plenty of playgroups and activities on offer in communities to give them a change of scene.

The mothers debate with presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes who have a son of their own

Presenter Ruth Langsford admitted she did find it difficult to say no to playing with her son, Jack, 12, who she has with husband and co-presenter Eamonn Holmes.

'As he's an only child, I feel I should play with him when he wants me to, I'd find it hard to say I'm bored,' she admitted.

But Catherine argued that parents should not feel bad about this, as it's only natural. 

'You are a grown up, you don't need to fold a piece of paper a 100 times, children can do it themselves,' she said.

The show asked viewers to vote on whether there have there been times they've been bored by their children. They said...

Definitely: 37 per cent

Sometimes: 32 per cent

Never: 31 per cent

Catherine's views echo those of Daily Mail columnist and mother-of-four Lorraine Candy, who made her position clear earlier this week.  

She said: 'Once you’ve kissed all their delicious fatty bits, sniffed the top of their heads and taken comedy pictures of them in adult sunglasses, babies and young toddlers are boring if you spend all day every day with them.' 

The editor of Elle magazine said she made an effort with her older two children but soon learnt that it 'drained the joy out of being with them and made me short-tempered and impatient. 

'Those were foolish times. When the next two arrived, I drew up a shortlist of stuff I was - and wasn't - going to do. I stopped being an "over-involved mummy pleaser" and started being me. I like a bit of glitter-sticking, an hour or so of Monopoly and the occasional bake-off.

'I do not like Cluedo, putting on a play, pretending to be a fairytale creature, or watching musicals. I loathe hide-and-seek and bike-riding.'
