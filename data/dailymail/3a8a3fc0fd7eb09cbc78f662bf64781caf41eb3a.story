When Kevin Moran casually offered his girlfriend Molly McGinnis to duck into a photo booth for some fun pictures, she had no idea that with the click of a shutter her life would change forever.

McGinnis, Moran's high school sweetheart, did not know that her boyfriend of seven years had come up with a creative way to propose to her in an intimate setting but in such a way that their special moment would be preserved for posterity.

As the two sat grinning inside the photo booth on Tuesday, Kevin quickly reached into his pocket and popped open a jewelry box revealing an engagement ring inside - just in time for the camera to capture the priceless expression of surprise on Molly's face.

She said, 'yes!: Molly was stunned and delighted, and of course she accepted Kevin's proposal 

A video of Moran's off-the-beaten-path proposal, which has since gone viral on Reddit and YouTube, shows Molly breaking into a smile and saying the one word Kevin was hoping to hear: 'Yes!'

The happy couple smile and giggle, with Molly appearing shell-shocked and utterly delighted.

The final picture of the two inside the photo booth shows the lovebirds sealing their engagement with a kiss.

The backstory of the heart-melting proposal is that Moran lured McGinnis to an Iowa mall under the pretense that they had to buy some presents for the holidays, ABC 7 Chicago reported. 

As it so happened, the impromptu shopping trip fell on the couple's seventh anniversary.

After the proposal, the couple went out for dinner to celebrate their engagement.

On Twitter that night, an overjoyed McGinnis gushed: 'Happiest day of my life is an understatement. So so excited to be the future Mrs. Moran! Cheers!'

Moran said when he pulled McGinnis into the photo booth outside one of the stores at the mall he had no idea that it was equipped not only with a camera, but also with a video recording device that captured the entire proposal, with all the sweet in-between moments.

He later uploaded the minute-long clip onto Reddit, where he confessed that he had been nervous and had spent a lot of time practicing opening the ring box.
