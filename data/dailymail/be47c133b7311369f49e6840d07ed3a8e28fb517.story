President Obama has led the mourning for the victims gunned down while watching the new Batman movie in Colorado with a moment of silence from his campaign trail in Fort Myers, Florida.

In an address, which came just hours after a gunman broke into an Aurora cinema and killed 12 cinema-goers and injured 59 others, Obama said the tragedy came as a reminder 'that life is fragile'.

The crowd cheered as the president stepped to the podium half-an-hour earlier than scheduled, but he asked the crowd to sit down and called for a more sombre mood.

'There are going to be other days for politics,' he said. 'This is a day for prayer and reflection.'

He continued: 'This morning we woke up to news of a 
tragedy that reminds us of all the ways we are united as one American 
family.

'We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time. Such violence, such evil is senseless; it's beyond reason.'

But, he added: 'We do know what makes life worth living. People in Aurora loved and were loved.'

The president went on: 'If there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile here, time here is limited and it is precious.

'What matters at the end of the day 
is not the small things; it is not the trivial things ... Ultimately it 
is how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.'

He said, as a parent, the news of the 'heinous' crime had terrified him.

'My daughters go to the movies. What if 
Malia and Sasha had been in the theater as so many of our kids do every 
day?' He added that he would hug his daughters 'a little tighter' 
tonight.

The president then bowed his head and lead a moment of silence.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney also spoke about the 'hateful act' from Bow, New Hampshire.

'This is a time for each of us to look into our hearts and remember how much we love each other,' he said. 'There is so much love and goodness in the hearts of Americans.'

He said the nation will no doubt hear about the individual talents of each victim in the coming days, and how the country will come together to offer comfort to their grieving families and communities.

'There will be justice for those responsible,' he added. 'But today is a moment to grieve and to help.'

Obama will return to Washington later today and cancel further campaign events. Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have also cancelled their events in the wake of the tragedy.

As Obama spoke, details of the alleged killer and his crime continued to emerge. Police identified him as 24-year-old Jame Holmes, a reclusive student who had just dropped out from a PhD program.

Witnesses said he broke into the cinema brandishing as many as four guns - including pistols and an assault rifle - before throwing a canister of smoke or tear gas that then exploded in the auditorium.

He waited for the explosion before firing at the audience members at random. They had gathered to see the late-night premier of The Dark Knight Rises, which began at midnight.

Victims were rushed to hospitals, with a 12-year-old killed and a three-month-old baby shot in the back. The gunman was found in the cinema parking lot and did not resist arrest.
