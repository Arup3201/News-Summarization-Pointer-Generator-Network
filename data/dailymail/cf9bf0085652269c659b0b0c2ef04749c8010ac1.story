England landed back in New Zealand's north island armed with a strong Test line-up and a fervent desire to stop the All Blacks' 'phenomenal' run of success against all-comers.

The host nation are targeting a 17th consecutive victory on Saturday, to draw level with the world record set by their predecessors in the Sixties and matched by the Springboks in 1997-98.

Their opponents harbour considerable respect for the exploits of Steve Hansen’s team – who have lost just once since the last World Cup – but they are hell-bent on halting the Kiwi juggernaut.

Stuart Lancaster has presided over largely impressive results during his two-and-a-half years in charge of England, but he saluted the astonishing consistency of the All Blacks.

Asked about their 16-in-a-row winning run, he said: 'That feat is phenomenal. They have won 35 out of 37 as well (since the last World Cup).

'To play home and away at international level against the quality of opposition they’ve played is a phenomenal record and that’s why they are No 1 in the world. Ourselves, South Africa, Australia and Wales are all striving to emulate them.'

While the series has already been won by New Zealand, their crusade to set new global records and England’s determination to finish a promising tour with tangible success means that there will be no shortage of motivation going into Saturday’s Test. Lancaster outlined just how much the match will mean to his squad.

'We’ve made quite a few changes, but definitely not on an experimental basis,' said the head coach.

'It’s certainly a very important game for us. We don’t see this third game as any sort of dead rubber whatsoever; it's a hugely important game for us and New Zealand. They want to build momentum heading into the Rugby Championship and we want to finish the season strongly.

'We've had a great season all round really. We’ve been close in these two games and we want to get that win so when we play New Zealand in November we're in a strong position. It would be huge to beat the All Blacks away.

'We were in a very similar position in South Africa two years ago. We lost two Test matches, the second one quite narrowly, but dug in in the third Test and produced a very strong performance. 

'That enables everyone to finish the tour on a positive note and reflect all the hard work done.'

Lancaster reacted to the announcement of the All Blacks’ line-up by describing it as a ‘pretty strong team’, which was a masterpiece of under-statement.

The IRB’s reigning world Player of the Year, Kieran Read, is back for the home side at No 8 and Lancaster added: 'That is a huge boost for them, he’s a world-class player and they’ll be delighted to have him back. We’re aware of his threat.'

Read’s threat is substantial, but the other grave threat to English ambition is that the visitors' collective intensity and composure dips at any stage, as it did in both Auckland and Dunedin, with grim consequences. Lancaster is demanding an effective mixture of physical ferocity and calm heads from his men, as they seek a consolation prize.

'We need the full 80-minute performance to beat them,' he said. 'In the first Test it was the last five minutes when we didn’t manage the game in the right areas of the field.

'That period in the second Test at the start of the second half was also down to game-management and that’s what we need to get right to deliver the win.'
