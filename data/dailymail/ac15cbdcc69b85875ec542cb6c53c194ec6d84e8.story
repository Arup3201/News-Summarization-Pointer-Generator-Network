Energy firm EDF has announced a price cut of just 1.3 per cent – less than 18p a week - on gas tariffs

Energy firm EDF has announced a puny price cut of just 1.3per cent – less than 18p a week - in a devastating snub to customers.

The reduction on gas tariffs is worth a saving of just £9 on the average annual household energy bill and is tiny in the context of a sharp fall in wholesale energy prices.

Wholesale gas prices are down by around 28per cent in a year and electricity by 15per cent, which could deliver annual savings of £140 if they were passed on in full.

EDF, which is a subsidiary of a power company owned by the French government, is the last of the ‘big six’ suppliers to announce a cut in tariffs in the last two weeks.

Earlier reductions of around 5per cent and less by the other five – British Gas, SSE, Npower, Eon and Scottish Power – have all been derided as too little and too late.

However, none have done so little as EDF with a reduction that is so small as to make no real difference to the one million customers on standard variable rate tariffs who will receive it.

At the same time customers will not get the benefit of the reduction until February 11 and after the snow storms predicted for the next few days have passed.

EDF’s minuscule price cut also represents a snub to the Chancellor George Osborne and other ministers, who have demanded energy firms pass on falls in their costs to customers.

Mr Osborne, who recently took to Twitter to say it was ‘vital’ that the price cuts are passed, has ordered a Treasury investigation to make sure this happens.

The tiny reduction announced by EDF suggests the company does not expect any kind of sanction.

The company defended the small reduction saying that it was unable to cut further because it had bought a lot of gas and electricity at the high prices that existed before the falls over the past year.

Other companies have tried to blame Labour and its pledge to freeze prices until 2017 should the party win the General Election in May for the smaller than warranted reductions.

The firms suggest that they are unable to cut deeper because they fear being locked into low prices that will hit their profits over the long term.

The Conservative Energy and Business minister Matt Hancock suggested the recent price cuts, including the one from EDF, were ‘very encouraging’.

However, consumer experts condemned the energy giants for turning the screw on customers in the teeth of the winter.

Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, described the 1.3per cent reduction as ‘paltry’.

The reduction on gas tariffs is worth a saving of just £9 on the average annual household energy bill and is tiny in the context of a sharp fall in wholesale energy prices, which are down by around 28 per cent in a year

He said: ‘It was inevitable that we would see the final of the ‘big six’ cut its prices this week and this is truly the most underwhelming of the lot EDF Energy. On top of that, we see that bill payers will again not feel the full benefit of lower bills immediately.

‘EDF’s customers will see overall energy bills fall by just £9 a year if paying by monthly direct debit – down to £1,155 a year.

‘That is an absolutely paltry price cut in comparison to the fall in wholesale prices that we have seen.’

He added: ‘It’s been frustrating to see all but one of the big six choose to delay a cut in prices. They have all ensured that they gain a few extra week at higher prices when energy consumption by consumers remains high in the colder weather.’

Ann Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch.com, said the EDF announcement confirms that the 60per cent of households who are on variable rate tariffs are not getting a fair deal.

‘These meagre reductions are too little too late and must be increased to help hard-pressed consumers struggling with their energy bills this winter,’ she said.

She said householders must now take matters into their own hands and switched to fixed rate deals that can offer annual savings of more than £300 a year.

The industry regulator Ofgem is so concerned that energy firms are charging rip-off prices that it has referred them to a full-blown inquiry by the Competition & Markets Authority.

However, this will take at least six months and currently, Ofgem has no powers to force the industry to pass on a fair reductions in tariffs.

Mark Todd, director of energyhelpline.com, said: ‘This is a price cut so small you’d probably need a microscope to see it. Consumers will struggle to notice it in their next energy bills.’

The EDF chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said: ‘We continue to look for ways to bear down on costs for customers and will offer more help to the most vulnerable, for example encouraging them to switch to fixed tariffs.

‘If wholesale gas prices create cost reductions which allow further price cuts these will be passed to customers as soon as possible.’

Business and Energy minister, Matt Hancock, said: ‘Energy bills are falling. It’ s very encouraging that all major suppliers are now passing on savings from lower global gas prices. Of course I will continue to meet with the big firms to make sure that hardworking households are getting a fair deal.

‘This case is by no means closed and we will be watching the global gas markets very closely, expecting to see any further savings passed on.’

Lib-Dem Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, said: ‘People want to see bigger savings now and energy companies need to up their game if they want their customers to stick around.’ 

Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: ‘Given wholesale gas prices have fallen by at least 20 per cent, a measly price cut of just 1.3 per cent is yet more evidence of why we need a tough new regulator with the power to ensure that energy companies pass on the full savings from falls in wholesale costs to all consumers, as Labour has proposed.’
