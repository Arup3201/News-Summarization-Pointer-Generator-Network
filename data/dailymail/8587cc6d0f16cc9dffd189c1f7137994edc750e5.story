A rare white dingo pup is the proud new addition to Fraser Coast Wildlife Sanctuary's family as of Friday.

Curator Ray Revill - also dubbed the animal whisperer in his town - says this is a 'pretty spectacular' occasion, considering it's the first time they've taken in a white dingo since the sanctuary was established nine years ago.

'We're possibly the only wildlife centre in Queensland with a white dingo,' he said.

This follows the tragic loss of one of the five dingoes at the sanctuary in Maryborough - north of Brisbane.

Mr Revill is still grieving the death of 15-year-old Karla, who died of old age seven weeks ago.

'Karla and I were thick as thieves so I took it pretty hard when she passed,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I still have her ashes beside my bed and I have a little urn that I keep in my pocket so she's with me all the time.

'Call me passionate or crazy - I don't care.'

Last year Mr Revill paid tribute to their friendship and had a portrait of Karla tattooed on his right leg.

'When she died I got "RIP. Spirit Run Free" tattooed around her,' he said.

Although no other animal could ever replace Karla, it appears the Mr Revill and six-week-old Spirit have already created a strong bond.

'She came straight over to me and crawled onto my lap when I first walked in the door,' he said.

'So she definitely chose me.'

Despite his heartbreak over Karla, he can't help but feel 'over the moon' when he sees little Spirit.

'Yesterday she gave a little puppy howl which made me hysterical and brought a little tear to my eye,' he said.

The 57-year-old, who's been caring for animals since the age of five, is keeping a close eye on playful Spirit at his home - the sanctuary.

'You couldn't ask for a better backyard,' he said.

The breeder, Simon Stretton, said Spirit comes from a litter of four white pups.

'That's rare in itself,' he said.

He said 80 per cent of dingoes are ginger, 18 per cent are black and tanned and the remaining 2 per cent are white.

Spirit's grandmother Opal is also white but her mother Honey is ginger.

The white pup was named after a dingo that died on Fraser Island on Queensland's south coast.

Mr Revill hopes to continue raise dingoes and use them as an educational tool to end the stigma surrounding the canines.

Queensland's passionate dingo breeder Simon Stretton says there are some common misconceptions surrounding the Canis lupus.
