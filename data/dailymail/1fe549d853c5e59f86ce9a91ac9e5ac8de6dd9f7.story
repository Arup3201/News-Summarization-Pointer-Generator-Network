Mauricio Pochettino has praised Stadium mk as Tottenham consider their options for a temporary home.

Spurs will need to leave White Hart Lane for the 2017-18 season after hitting delays in their plans to build a new 56,000-capacity stadium.

Wembley is currently looking unlikely because it is limited by Brent Council to 37 events each year, owing to issues including noise, policing and parking. 

In the original plans, the Northumberland Development Project was due to be completed by August 2014

MK Dons' stadium:mk looks the favourite to become Tottenham's temporary home 

But the home of MK Dons, as well as the Olympic Stadium, are believed to be contenders, with Pochettino impressed by the Dons’ facilities when he watched their Capital One Cup win over Manchester United last month.

He said: ‘It’s a very good stadium with very good facilities.’

A move to Milton Keynes would involve a 48-mile trek north for supporters, but Tottenham’s options are limited with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger ruling out a groundshare at the Emirates Stadium.

Wenger said the issue was ‘very sensitive’, adding: ‘I don’t think that will happen.’
