A Russian woman has been jailed after trying to hire a hitman to kill her daughter-in-law after she got fed up with her jokes.

Tatiana Kudinova, 50, told police daughter-in-law Roxanne, 30, kept making fun of the fact that she was less well off, and decided she wanted her dead.

However, the man Kudinova paid to kill Roxanne turned out to be an undercover police officer, and she was arrested.

Kudinova claims she fell out with her daughter-in-law after a party when the pair started arguing about who should pay for the food for the guests.

After this, she says Roxanne kept making jokes about her being a 'skinflint mother-in-law', which irritated her so much she wanted her dead.

Kudinova, from Rostov, southern Russia, then contacted a local criminal gang, offering them £1,200 to kill Roxanne. 

According to police, Kudinova told the gang; 'I don't care how she dies, I only want you to kill her'

What she did not realise was that the man she paid a £600 deposit to was in fact an undercover policeman.

Officers then devised an elaborate sting to catch Kudinova by faking Roxanne's death and taking photos of her 'corpse'.

A police spokesman said: 'We needed to catch her in the act of paying for the murder and giving an advance payment was not enough.

'So we arranged for it to appear as though the daughter-in-law was dead, covered her in fake blood and took photos to convince the woman that the hit had taken place.

'She was arrested after handing over the rest of the money to one of of our undercover officers.\n\n

Appearing in court, the judge told her: 'You are an evil, callous woman who sought to destroy someone's life and ruin the happiness of your son.

'You did this because of a few jokes.'

Kudinova was sentenced to nine years in prison.
