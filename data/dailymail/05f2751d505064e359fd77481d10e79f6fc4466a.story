Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has shown she is well and truly ready to be a grandmother as she entertained fans' babies during a publicity tour for her new book.

The politician and wife of former President Bill Clinton was photographed with fans' children during a recent book signing in Cambridge to promote 'Hard Choices', her new book which details her time as US Secretary of State during the Obama administration.

Meanwhile her daughter Chelsea, who is expecting later this year, was busy speaking at the opening session of a volunteering conference in Atlanta.

Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton, with her baby bump hidden, took part in a round table discussion on social change

Chelsea announced in April she and husband Marc Mezvinsky were 
expecting their first child later this year, with Hillary calling it her 'most exciting title yet: Grandmother-to-be'.

During
 her speech, which opened the conference in Atlanta, Chelsea called for more
 opportunities to engage millennials in community work.

The 34-year-old is well placed to make such judgements - she has worked with her father's non-profit organisation, the Clinton Foundation, for many years and is a special correspondent for ABC News.

The conference featured leaders from nonprofits, business and government discussing the volunteer sector

She serves as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation and kept her baby bump covered as she spoke to about 5000 people who gathered for the conference.

The audience heard she supported efforts that would allow more graduates to reduce their student loan debt through volunteering.

'It is in all of our interests to ensure that every young person in America who wants to serve is given the opportunity to serve,' she said.

Her mother was also busy entertaining an audience - with queues of people at the Harvard Book Store, in Cambridge, getting their copies of her new autobiography signed.

The book details her role at Secretary of State during the first term Obama administration, during which she was at the forefront of US responses to the erupting Arab Spring, the assassination of Osama Bin Laden and the Syrian Civil War.
