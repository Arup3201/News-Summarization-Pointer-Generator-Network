New imagery has helped U.S. officials find an Army plane that crash landed on Greenland almost 70 years ago at the beginning of the Cold War.

The Kee Bird B-29 Superfortress plane was on its way to a top secret mission at the North Pole when it made the emergency landing in 1947 after running out of fuel.

The imagery comes from NASA’s Earth Observatory, and shows the plane nearly covered in snow at the remote crash site.

The plane’s crew spent three days toughing it out on the ice sheet before they were rescued, according to Huffington Post. They survived, but the plane’s legend only grew.

It sat marooned on the hard-packed snow sitting atop a frozen lake, it remained untouched for decades.

It had not been seen since.

Then and now: The shadow of the NASA Orion P-3 Plane that took the image can be seen near the top of the image

The photos were taken May 1 by a NASA’s P-3 Orion aircraft while it was on a mission as part of Operation IceBridge.

The eight-year project aims to survey glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice in polar regions in an effort to gauge changes in polar ice, according to Huffington Post.

Kee Bird was found by accident.

Thin lines in the snow around the plane are believed to be polar bear trails.

There are currently no known plans to resurrect the doomed aircraft.
