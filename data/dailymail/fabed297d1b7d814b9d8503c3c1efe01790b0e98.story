Thought text speak - or txt spk as it it known - was a modern phenomenon? Not if a recently unearthed collection of acerbic letters written by Queen Victoria is any indication.

The collection of more than 20 untidy handwritten notes contain a form of text speak where the monarch substituted words for abbreviations including 'wh' for 'which', 'shd' for 'should', 'abt' for 'about' and 'wd.' for 'would'.

All of the correspondence, which will go under the hammer next month, is addressed to James Forbes, the man responsible for running Balmoral on her behalf.

Fascinating: The handwritten notes reveal Queen Victoria's familiarity with text speak as well as her kindness

Considerate: The ageing monarch's notes show her to have been a concerned employer

They were written during the last four years of her life and form part of an archive worth between £6,000 and £8,000 according to the auction house.

They show the Queen’s keen interest in 
the welfare of her staff and tenants and continued appetite for life 
despite her advancing years.

All are written on the heavy mourning 
paper she adopted on the death of Prince Albert in 1861 and most are 
signed VR1. They were sent from Windsor, Osborne, the home she shared 
with Albert, and Nice as well as internally at Balmoral itself.

Bonhams book specialist Henry Baggott 
said: 'These letters throw a fascinating light on the private Queen 
Victoria and show her to have been far kinder and more considerate than 
her rather forbidding public image suggested.'

Along with the letters, a collection of three handkerchiefs which carry the VR monogram and a hat pin case made in bone reportedly owned by the queen will go on sale in Edinburgh next month.

But it is the intimate letters that are the source of the most excitement, not least because of the unusual abbreviations.

Bonhams spokesman Andrew Currie added: 'The writing is quite untidy and the abbreviations are interesting, a sort of early form of texting which suggest Queen Victoria was a hundred years ahead of her time.

Important: The letters will go on sale alongside a collection of Royal memorabilia, including personal items

'Wh' - which

'Shd' - should

'Abt' - about

'Wd' - would

'Sales of this sort are not that rare, but what is unusual is the letters show the Queen was keen to strike up personal relationships with her staff, showing her concern for her household, tenants and neighbours at Balmoral.

'The letters are, in places, outspoken and give a vivid impression of the Queen’s personality. There is a range of people who will be interested, from collectors of royal memorabilia to museums and public bodies.'

In one Victoria advises Forbes on how to handle the tricky minister at Balmoral by advising him to 'be very careful to be exact & very discreet & keep out of rows (like the choir trouble) or writing in any of the papers wh. was one of Mr Sibald’s accusations last year.

'But I fear Mr S. is of a vindictive spirit & I rather fear, not very exact himself. At any rate you shd try & find out the story abt the Free Kirk Minister, as I am sure that that is a "mistake".'

Victoria was always solicitous about her staff whom she regarded as part of her extended family.

On the death of Lizzie Brown, the wife of William who was brother to the Queen’s favourite, John, she wrote: 'The death of dear excellent Mrs Wm Brown whom I was so very fond of and with whom I had been so intimate is real grief to me & I dare not think of how dreadfully I shall miss her.

'Her loss is really irreparable... Poor William I do pity so much for he is so helpless & dear Lizzie was everything in the world to him.'

The Queen’s views of her aristocratic neighbours, however, were less charitable: 'I have never invited the Duke of Atholl to come over with his men and I think it wd. be better not to do so this year. It wd. entail the encampment of his men in our grounds wh. wd. be inconvenient.'

Also included in the lot are other items that reveal Victoria's closeness to the Forbes family, among them a watercolour calendar illustrated with portraits of the Forbes’s three children and inscribed by the monarch to Mrs Forbes.
