A BASE jumping enthusiast has bravely posted footage of his latest jump on his Vimeo channel even through it portrays his abilities in a less than flattering light.

The video, posted by user Subterminallyill, shows the extreme sports fan crashing into a protruding sheet of rock not long after jumping off a cliff on November 24.

BASE jumping is supposed to be an 
activity where participants jump from a fixed object and use a parachute 
to break their fall, but unfortunately that isn't how it worked out in 
this case.

The video, posted by user Subterminallyill, shows the extreme sports fan crashing into a protruding sheet of rock not long after jumping off a cliff on November 24

He smashes into the rock with such force that on impact the piece of rock breaks apart in an explosion of red dust

The footage starts with the parachutists
 jumping off the cliff, but almost immediately he appears to be too 
close to the rock face and we see him trying to adjust his direction.

Unfortunately for Subterminallyill tugging on his parachute doesnâ€™t do much to move him away from the cliff face or kill his speed and then he crashes headfirst into a jutting piece of rock.

Next the camera shows the clearly disorientated jumper with his arms and legs flailing and he is sent into a tumble.

He proceeds to smash into the cliff several more times, before finally landing in a crumpled heal on the ground.

A second video camera captures the final part of his fall as he appears to almost slide down the face of the cliff.

Judging from the footage, the jumper had to have injured himself and on his Vimeo account he confirms that he has suffered a list of ailments including a fracture of his T12 vertebra, five stitches to his eye, six stitches to his chin, a severely sprained back, wrist and hand and multiple bruises.

For another considering taking up the extreme sport, the footage could well make them think again.

BASE is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: building, antenna, span, and Earth.
