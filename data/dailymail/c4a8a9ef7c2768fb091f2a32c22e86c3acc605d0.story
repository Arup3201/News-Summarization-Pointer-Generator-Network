Snaking queues formed on the forecourts today as petrol pumps began to run dry following the closure of one of the UK's largest refineries.

Fearful motorists found themselves backed up in jams stretching out of petrol stations in the South East as pumps displayed signs warning that supplies had been drained.

Drivers attempting to fill their tanks at Waitrose in Southend, Essex, were greeted by a message that diesel had run out.

Chaos: Long queues formed at petrol station in the South East today - like this one at Waitrose in Southend, Essex - after Coryton refinery stopped trading

The chaos follows the closure yesterday of Coryton refinery in Essex, which supplies 10 per cent of the UK's fuel and a fifth of the petrol used in the South East.

Fuel prices have risen again just 24 hours after the refinery's Swiss parent company Petroplus went bust and Coryton ceased supplies to filling stations.

And petrol retailers and motoring groups have warned that more hikes are in the pipeline, adding: ‘The only way is up.’

Diesel rose to 142.32p ( from 142.21p) per litre – and is now within a fraction of 1p of a new record. Petrol rose to 134.03 (from 133.89p) per litre the previous day, the AA reported.

The knock-on effects of action would have come too late to have an impact on the latest prices, but motoring groups have warned that ‘profiteering’ speculators will seize on the restricted supply to drive up the wholesale cost of petrol and diesel, pushing up prices to consumers at the pumps.

It has sparked fears of ‘panic buying’ to avoid shortages and big price hikes.

Coryton’s administrators Price Waterhouse Cooper (PwC) confirmed at lunchtime that no fuel supplies were leaving the refinery today – three days after they were stopped. But production is continuing with refined fuel being stored on site.

Energy ministers insist the lost supplies are being made up from other refineries and from abroad and have urged motorists not to panic.

Petrol retailers predict diesel prices in particular are set to soar by up to 3p to a new record £1.45 a litre. That would see a £100 fill-up for ‘Mondeo Man’ in a family saloon with a 70-litre tank.

Record fuel prices were set in May last year when diesel hit 143.04p and petrol 137.43p.

This time last year, petrol was 128.51p – around 5p per litre less than today and diesel 133.15p per litre – nearly 10p cheaper.

Instability in Iran and their threat to blockade key oil tanker routes in the Straits of Hormuz the Gulf, coupled with the strong dollar, is also storing up trouble, retailers warned.

Fears escalate: Retailers are worried about panic buying making shortages worse and forcing up prices further

AA president Edmund King said: ’There is no doubt that the loss of supplies from a major UK refinery, plus the problems in Iran, is going to give the speculators a field day.

‘When they speculate, the only way is up as far as  fuel prices are concerned.

Motorists are going to have to get used to seeing petrol and diesel prices creeping up.‘It’s only a matter of time before the diesel record is broken.’

RMI Petrol’s Brian Madderson said shortages would push up the price of fuel as traders and speculators exploit the situation for profit.

‘I expect diesel to rise 3p a litre to a new record of £1.45 by the end of the month.The first impact will be a push through on wholesale prices.’

MPs and unions joined the chorus warning of shortages while forecourt bosses said there was a risk of parts of the South East ‘grinding to a halt’ after supplies from the Coryton refinery were suspended.

No petrol, diesel or other products, including bitumen for road building, were leaving the site today.

The action came when the refinery’s owner ran out of cash and was unable to extend its credit facilities. PwC said it had no idea when supplies would resume but was ‘talking to customers’.

The warnings came along with the threat to up to 1,000 UK jobs at the formerly BP-owned refinery.

A separate strike by more than 80 tanker drivers at the South Killingholme refinery in Lincolnshire, which supplies around 340 Jet filling stations, is exacerbating supply concerns.

But energy ministers and oil industry bosses said they were doing their best to make up the shortfall from the UK’s seven remaining refineries and by buying in from abroad. If today's rush to the pumps continues, however, filling stations could run dry.

PwC said refining was continuing at 
Coryton but supplies were being stored rather than being sent out. It 
could not say when normal service would resume.

Steven Pearson, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ‘Our immediate priority is to continue to operate the Coryton refinery and the Teesside oil storage business without disruption while the financial position is clarified and restructuring options are explored.’

Warning: East of England Euro MEP Richard Howitt said he didn't want to be alarmist but said that the suspension could impact the Olympics

The Government insisted it was doing all it could to find a buyer.

Forecourts fear a repeat of the crisis which caused chaos in Scotland in 2008 when the giant Grangemouth refinery was hit by strike action – leading to pumps running dry, ‘sold out’ signs, and some cases of petrol rationing north of the border.

RAC Motoring Strategist Adrian Tink said: ‘The message for motorists in the area is a simple one – don’t panic buy and potentially  create a problem.’

East of England Euro MEP Richard Howitt said: ‘I don’t want to be alarmist about this, but I don’t want to be dishonest either. Supplies across London and the South East could be affected and I have been told this could impact the Olympics.’

Coryton has refining capacity for ten
million tonnes of crude oil per year. Some 36 per cent of its output is
petrol and 27 per cent diesel, the rest a mixture of other fuels.

There
are seven other refineries in the UK – at South Killingholme and 
Lindsey, both in North Lincolnshire; Fawley, near Southampton; 
Grangemouth, near Falkirk; Stanlow in Cheshire; and Milford Haven and 
Pembroke, both in Pembrokeshire. Petroplus previously owned a refinery 
in Teesside, which closed in 2009.

The UK has 8,500 filling stations of which 2,132 are in the South East. Of these, about 600 are BP and Texaco sites supplied from Coryton.

Petroplus reported a net loss of £265million in the first nine months of last year, while in December its banks withdrew a £675million portion of its £1.29billion credit facility.

The other main supplier for the South East and London is the Exxon Mobil refinery in Fawley.

A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said it was helping to look for buyers but that the ‘immediate priority’ was to keep the Coryton refinery and Teesside storage business operating’. He added: ‘In the short term, companies have made alternative arrangements to ensure adequate supplies of products are available in the South East.’

Petroplus had been increasingly relying on its British offshoot for funds. At the end of 2009, it owed the British arm £42million.

But by the end of 2010 the Swiss company’s borrowings from its British subsidiary had ballooned to £114million. The company’s fate was sealed when 13 banks, including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas, froze a $1billion loan that was keeping it going.
