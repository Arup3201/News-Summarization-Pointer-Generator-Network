He spent years in the showbusiness wilderness after his first stint at the BBC ended in disaster.

But Chris Evans, 48, is now the king of breakfast radio after he pulled in a record 9.83million weekly listeners.

The presenter helped Radio 2 to its highest ever ratings over the past three months, the latest listener ratings have shown.

As The Chris Evans Breakfast Show added 10,000 listeners in a quarter, his Radio 1 rival Nick Grimshaw lost almost 400,000, according to audience measurement system Rajar.

Evans is now nearly 1.7million ahead of veteran DJ Terry Wogan, whom he replaced in 2010. Sir Terry managed a peak audience of 8.1million listeners in his final three months.

Radio 2 drew in 15.6million weekly listeners, up from 15.3million last year and its highest audience since records began in 2009.

Radio 1’s figure of 10.5million was up 200,000 on this time last year, but down 400,000 on the last quarter.

Grimshaw, 29, lost 526,000 listeners over the age of 25 in just three months but gained 130,000 under-24s.

His overall weekly audience of 5.9million is almost a million down on his predecessor Chris Moyles who stepped down as the station tried to attract younger listeners and make it more distinctive from Radio 2.

Last night Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said despite the audience decline, Grimshaw’s figures showed the strategy is working.

He said: ‘I was asked to build a younger audience for Radio 1 and regenerate the brand, and these figures show we’re doing exactly that. Grimmy and the Breakfast Show continue to gain young listeners, which is the challenge I set him.’

Evans’ continued success is particularly remarkable considering how spectacularly his career imploded in the 1990s.

Nick Grimshaw has lost Radio 1 almost a million listeners since he took over the slot from Chris Moyles, but has attracted nearly 130,000 under-24s as the show looks to attract a younger audience

The former TFI Friday presenter once admitted hosting most of his shows with a hangover when he was a Radio 1 star, and in 1995 was fined £7,000 when he turned up for work after a 17-hour pub crawl.

He eventually quit two years later after managers refused to give him Fridays off so he would have more time to recover from his binges, which saw him drink up to 20 pints of lager a day.

BBC radio boss Helen Boaden said: ‘The continuing success of the Chris Evans Breakfast Show is a tribute to all those who work so hard to make the show utterly unique.’

Radio 4’s weekly audience of 10.95million was up from last year’s figure but down from the last quarter’s record high of 11.2million.

Radio 3 added 100,000 listeners in the past three months.
