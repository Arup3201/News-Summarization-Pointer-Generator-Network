Southampton have re-launched a bid to sign Atletico Madrid defender Toby Alderweireld on loan and he is thought to favour a move to St Mary's over Newcastle.

Arsenal had also been interested in the Belgian defender but appear to have pulled out of the race.

But Koeman is close to sealing a deal for the 25-year-old as he continues his hunt for a replacement for Dejan Lovren.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman had been hoping to sign Virgil van Dijk from Celtic. 

But a dispute over the potential fee for the Dutchman has stalled the move, with the Scottish champions demanding £8million - a fee Southampton were not prepared to meet.

Southampton, who many predicted to struggle after selling so many of their star players this summer, but Koeman's side currently sit eight in the Premier League table, ad have impressed despite their losses.
