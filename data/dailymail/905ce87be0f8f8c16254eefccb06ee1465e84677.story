Tropical Storm Ernesto swept north of Barbados this morning and is now heading quickly into the Caribbean Sea - where it is expected to become a hurricane.

Forecasters said the eye of the storm was 35 miles northwest of the island at 2am and was now moving across the northern Windward Islands.

Island governments issued storm warnings for Barbados, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, St Lucia, Martinique and Guadalupe. Residents were told to expect storm conditions.

But it is unlikely Ernesto will turn towards Florida, as a strong ridge of high pressure should keep the system on a more westerly track.

Warning: Tropical Storm Ernesto swept north of Barbados this morning and is now heading quickly into the Caribbean Sea - where it is expected to become a hurricane

Ernesto was racing at a speed of 23mph and was expected to enter the Caribbean this afternoon, staying on the same northwesterly track for the next 48 hours.

This would put it just south of Jamaica by Monday, by which time it was expected to have gained hurricane strength.

It had top winds of 50mph today and will become a hurricane if those swirling winds reach 74mph.

Forecasters warned island residents to expect large waves and 5 to 8cm of rain, with nearly 13cm in isolated areas.

Several computer forecasting models showed it moving through or near the Yucatan Channel into the southern Gulf of Mexico in the middle of next week.

It was too early to know whether Ernesto could disrupt oil and gas operations clustered in the Gulf.

August and September are usually the most active months of the Atlantic-Caribbean hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.

David Zelinsky, a meteorologist at the Miami-based National Hurricane Centre, said the storm was a reminder for people to be prepared for the onslaught of bad weather.

He said: 'It's our first system coming out of the deep tropics this year.

'So maybe it's a good time for people to review their preparedness plans as we're getting into the part of the season where things normally begin to get a little more active.'
