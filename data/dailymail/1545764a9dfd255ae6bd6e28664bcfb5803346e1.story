The government tonight insisted it is getting tough on welfare handouts amid growing public anger about Benefits Street star White Dee's holiday in the sun.

Mother-of-two Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly and is said to receive up to £10,000-a-year in handouts - last night denied downing £500 bottles of champagne on holiday - insisting she ‘f****** hated the stuff’.

The Department for Work and Pensions refused to comment on her case directly, but mounted a fresh defence of its plans to to ensure anyone who is capable of work finds a job.

White Dee is facing a probe into her disability benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in Magaluf - while claiming to be too depressed to work

The reality TV star from the Channel 4 
programme had been reportedly seen drinking Moet during a bar crawl in 
Magaluf, where she also hosted a pool party that featured a wet T-shirt 
contest.

The trip sparked criticism because Dee, who receives Employment and Support Allowance,
 has always claimed she could not work because she suffered from 
depression.

Ministers insisted it would never commented on individual cases.

But Downing 
Street and the Department for Work and Pensions used the opportunity to 
highlight changes made to the benefits system since the coalition was 
formed in 2010.

David 
Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I would point you to all of the 
things the government is doing in terms of toughening up the regime.'

Employment
 and Support Allowance is replacing Incapacity Benefit, with claimants 
regularly reassessed to see if they are still eligible.

A
 DWP Spokesman said: 'We are reforming disability benefits by 
introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews for 
Disability Living Allowance - something missing under the old system.

'We
 are also re-assessing people on incapacity benefits to see what work 
they can do - with the right support - rather than just writing them off
 on sickness benefits as happened in the past.

'Our welfare reforms will ensure that support goes to those who need it most.'

Dee, who starred in the Channel 4 documentary about life on benefits, has been spotted drinking champagne in a luxury hotel in Magaluf this week

Officials also stressed that all complaints about any benefit claimant will be fully investigated.

'We are fixing the welfare system to stop errors and ensuring investigators have the resources to catch cheats,' the spokesman added.

'The public play a vital role in our efforts to crack down on benefit fraud and error. We urge anyone who suspects someone of cheating the system to report this to the benefit fraud hotline.

'If your circumstances have changed, make sure that you tell the authorities before any overpayments get out of hand or to make sure you are receiving your full entitlement.'

There is no suggestion Dee has broken the rules, and her aides say she has been in touch with benefits officials about her claims since February.

Since appearing on Benefits Street she has seen appeared on TV several times, and been linked with a string of new jobs including standing as an MP and becoming a TV chef.

This week she took to Facebook to deny claims that she drank 
champagne while on her holiday.

Dee, 42, said: ‘I’m 
turning into Jesus - making cloudy lemonade turn into booze. You gotta 
love the press haha.’ And, responding to a supportive comment, she 
added: ‘F****** hate the stuff hun haha.’

Her
 agent Barry Tomes insisted she was not paid for going on the trip. It 
was among a string of personal appearances she has made since finding 
fame on Benefits Street, filmed in Birmingham.

Mr Tomes told MailOnline yesterday: ‘Dee has been back in the UK since Saturday. Dee had lots of fun as the many pictures show.

‘She missed the children [and] she 
hates flying, but she understands why we are trying to get her active to
 help us decide the suitability for some projects we would like her to 
undertake in the future.

‘She is not on Job Seekers’ Allowance 
as reported - she is on [Employment and] Support Allowance. We have been
 in touch with the benefits agency since we started to represent Dee in 
February.’

The 42-year-old told the TV programme she has been left too depressed to work since her mother died

She was pictured sipping cocktails and lying on sun-loungers in the beach resort

It is not against the rules to go on holiday if you are in receipt of disability living allowance.

But
 claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensions immediately 
if their condition changes.

The Disability Living Allowance is a minimum of £21 a week. In
 the last financial year the UK's total bill on DLA was estimated at 
£13.7billion, given to 3.3million adults - equivalent to the Department for Transport's budget.

Those
 claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) - including Dee - can still claim 
benefits for four weeks if going abroad, but claimers must speak to 
their local Jobcentre before they leave.

ESA
 offers money to UK residents of working age if they are ill or disabled
 and unable to work, with the basic amount at £71.70 a week.

They
 must pass a limited capability for work assessment, and not receive 
Income Support, Jobseeker’s Allowance or Pension Credit.

The DWP does not discuss individual circumstances, due to data protection laws - specifically the Data Protection Act 1998.

This was passed in July 1998 and commenced in March 2000, under Tony Blair’s Labour government. It replaced the previous 1984 Act.

But Dee’s trip sparked a row on 
Twitter and Facebook. Chris Terry said: ‘White Dee obviously having 
another string of “good days” - eventually she might even use these to 
find a job.’

And
 Shona Lou added: ‘So White Dee is too depressed to work? She didn’t 
look depressed at the pool parties in Magaluf drinking champagne.’

But
 others were more supportive, with Louise Dunn posting: ‘How ridiculous.
 What [do] they expect you to do? Curl up in a ball and not enjoy yourself?’

Natalie
 Hart added: ‘Depression means you have to sit in a house and stare at 
the telly all day obviously! How silly of us to think otherwise! You 
have a good craic!’

Earlier 
today, the Mail reported how Dee was facing a probe into her disability 
benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in 
Magaluf – while claiming to be too depressed to work.

She claims Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), which has a basic amount of £71.70 per week and is given to those who are ill or disabled and unable to work.

Mr Tomes also told the Mail how Dee was currently 
considering an offer to front a new cookery show.

‘What many people don’t know about Dee is that she is an amazing cook and has been offered her own cookery show,’ he said.

Mr Tomes said he has recommended that Dee takes holidays in the sun to 
help her combat her depression so that she can get back into work.

He
 added that she has had seven offers from production companies in total,
 including from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as three 
separate record deals, but has had to turn them down because she is ‘too
 unwell’.

‘It is like a 
light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but 
then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can 
do,’ he said of her condition.

‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’  

It is now said the single mother-of-two will not face a quiz from benefits officials

She may be too depressed to work, but that didnt stop White Dee partying hard on holiday in Magaluf

Mr
 Tomes added that Dee, who is said to receive £10,000 a year in 
benefits, is preparing for two other all-expenses paid holidays – with 
her two children – to France next month, then to mainland Spain in July.

'How ridiculous. What [do] they expect you to do? Curl up in a ball and not enjoy yourself?'

Louise Dunn, online commenter

Her current trip saw her 
fly out to Spain on Wednesday last week, where she posed with £500 
bottles of champagne and downed copious amounts of alcohol.

She
 was invited on the four-day holiday by another of her agent’s clients, 
an American singer. Together they attended a pub crawl organised by 
events firm, Carnage Magaluf.

Alan
 Collinson, who organises the event and was pictured with Dee, is 
accused of attacking a groom and three members of his stag party, it was
 revealed last night.

The Benefits Street star was spotted enjoying an all-expenses-paid, mid-week trip to Majorca

It is not known if Dee was on the same bar crawl when the incident took place, but she was at the resort at the time.

'It is like a light switch goes off when you are with her - sometimes she’s fine but then suddenly her whole mood will change'

Mr Tomes

The groom, Jordan Carty, was left with a broken jaw. Police in Majorca have launched an investigation.

Before
 the incident, Mr Collinson, 28, said that he didn’t know Dee had 
depression, adding: ‘She came across as a good laugh. She’s off out 
tonight with us on a bar crawl.

‘I don’t think she is a big drinker though – she told me she prefers tea and biscuits.’
