The man dubbed 'America's scariest police chief' will not lose his job after posting 'disturbing' videos of himself firing assault rifles and threatening liberals because the town's mayor thinks he is exercising his freedom of speech.

Mark Kessler is the only police officer in the tiny hamlet of Gilberton, Pennsylvania, but has caused serious concern following his appearances in a slew of foul mouthed and provocative videos in which he attacks Secretary of State John Kerry and makes rude slurs against liberals.

The self-professed gun fanatic and militia member, who carries an M-16 to work policing his town of 700 people, has been unapologetic about his conduct denying all claims he is a 'delusional lunatic' and claims the YouTube clips were 'designed to get people's attention.'

Chief of Police of One: Mark Kessler  the one-man police force of tiny Gilberton has made a series of videos in which he advocates his support of the Second Amendment and made disparaging remarks about liberals

Kessler made headlines in 2011 after he shot himself in the hand after pulling his weapon to intervene in a bar fight. He was off-duty and was the only person armed in the altercation.

To date, over 40,000 people have viewed Kessler's videos - which he uploads under the banner of his Constitutional Security Force - which he claims is designed to protect the rights of all Americans, but isn't a militia - despite being armed.

'What he does in his private life, we have no control of,' Gilberton Mayor Mary Lou Hannon told Frank Andruscavage of the Pottsville Republican Herald when asked about the video.

In one video Kessler uploaded to YouTube on July 15th, the 14-year veteran tells viewers offended by his profanity to 'go f**k yourself'.

'F**k all you libtards out there, as a matter of fact, read my shirt,' rants Kessler as he turns to reveal the back of his T-shirt which reads, 'Liberals take it in the a**.'

'You take it in the a**a and I don't give a f**k what you say so you can all just go f**K yourselves,' says Kessler.

'If you f**king maniacs want to turn this into an armed revolt, knock yourselves out. I'm not about that, so see you on the other side.'

In a second video uploaded to YouTube later that day, Kessler takes it on himself to pretend to apologize to the thousands of people who wrote him messages of complaint.

The unnerving video begins with a mock-apology to all those 'libtards' who claimed their feelings were hurt by his language and then begins a rant about calling Secretary of State john Kerry a 'traitor'.

In the video he claims to be annoyed by a recent news article in which Kerry says the U.N. would sign an arms control treaty which many conservatives see as a stealth assault on the Second Amendment.

'That piece of s**t traitor,' yells Kessler into the camera.

'Who is he to decide what we can and can't own? And f**K the U.N. Who are they to decide what we, the American people, can own?'

'I've got a message to Kerry and to these c**ksuckers over in the U.N. Sign anything you want to sign. It's not going to mean s**t.

'You know what I have to say to you? Come and take it, motherf**kers.'

Kessler then proceeds to fire off rounds from his assault weapon, calling it his 'sincere apology.'

After firing the first weapon, Kessler screams out, 'I'm hurting some feelings today. All you f**king libtards out there, all you f**king crybabies, grow a pair of balls, and man the F**k up, all right?'

In an interview with the Pottsville Republican-Herald, Kessler affirmed his right to make the videos.

'I think the video is in support of the Constitution—the support of the First Amendment, the right to express your thoughts and words freely without reprisal from any government,' said Kessler.

'That’s why I used the vocabulary I did. As for the firing of the guns, that is my Second Amendment right. I have the right to keep and bear arms regardless of what the government says that I don’t.'

Kessler's Constitutional Security Forces, despite stating they are not a militia are still armed and declare they will, 'Defend our Constitution our country from tyranny only if needed.'

Attack on John Kerry: In his second video, Kessler pretended to apologize and then launched into a violent tirade against John Kerry culminating in him firing a round of assault rifle fire

He also hosts his own regular radio show and has uploaded videos to YouTube in which he claims he is being followed by suspicious helicopters and unidentified members of the military.

The chief, Mark Kessler, the one-man police force of tiny Gilberton, population about 800, and some other gun-rights advocates view the treaty — which Congress would have to ratify for the U.S. to take part — as a step toward restricting the domestic use of more conventional weapons that are personal property.

In a telephone interview, Kessler said he made the videos to draw attention to what he views as the erosion of the constitutional rights of free speech and to bear arms and to speak out for the many others who are afraid to do so.

He also said he is increasingly concerned about what he views as a government out of control, citing the FBI's use of drones, the National Security Agency's collection of hundreds of millions of Americans' phone records and the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status by politically active groups.

'I'm trying to wake people up to say, 'Hey, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye.' A lot more,' Kessler said in an interview from Texas where the 41-year-old father of four was vacationing.

'It goes way beyond the Second Amendment, the First Amendment. It's a shame. Our founding fathers didn't intend for our government to be the way it is.'

Kessler, who called himself 'a wholeheartedly good man who loves his country,' acknowledged that some people were upset by the videos, but he said he does not regret posting them and insisted that many more people were supportive of them.

Gilberton Mayor Mary Lou Hannon said Wednesday that she found the language offensive and understood that many others did, too.

'They're like watching an R-rated movie,' Hannon said. 'The profanity and violence in it was a little upsetting.'

Not a Militia: The Constitutional Security Force which is headed by Kessler deny they are a militia

The weapons in the video are legal weapons and belong to the police department after he purchased them with his own money and donated them in a transaction approved by the borough council, Hannon said.

The council, which has had a contract with Kessler for 14 years, is planning to address the matter with Kessler in a private session Wednesday, Hannon said.

She said she supports his continued employment, noting that he has made a lot of residents feel safe and responds to emergencies at all hours.

'If you were in trouble and you needed somebody to protect you, Mark would be the person you would want running to your aid,' Hannon said. 'My experience and that of many of our residents (is) he will die for you. He's loyal and I think that's important.'

Watch Video Here:

Kessler, a former coal miner, is active in gun-rights circles, appearing on an online radio broadcast on the conservative conspiracy theory website Infowars, hosting an online radio show on a website that bills itself as the 'voice of the resistance,' speaking at gun-rights rallies and hosting his own website where he is seeking recruits for what he calls the Constitutional Security Force.

He also has claimed in recent weeks that his outspoken views on gun rights have earned him death threats.

On Wednesday, he would not say how many people have signed up for the security force, but said there are chapters in 45 states and many recruits are current or former members of law enforcement and the military.

The mission, he says on the website, is to help the military or peace officers to defend the constitution and country from 'tyranny.'

In January, Kessler drafted a resolution the borough adopted that calls for 'nullifying' any federal, state or local regulations that infringe on the Second Amendment. He boasted about the resolution while speaking at a February gun-rights rally on the steps of the Pennsylvania Capitol.

'If they come in and try to disarm any of my citizens, it's not going to go over very well,' he told the crowd.
