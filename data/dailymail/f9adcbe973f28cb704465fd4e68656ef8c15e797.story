One is a top Italian fashion designer. The other is one of the world's top costume experts. Together Miuccia Prada and Catherine Martin are a fashionable tour de force.

The pair teamed up to create a wardrobe of dresses for Carey Mulligan's character in Bas Lurhmann's hotly anticipated film, The Great Gatsby.

Now some of the 40 dresses are going on display in an exhibition at the Prada New York Epicenter which will run until 12th May.

Challenge: According to Martin, the hard part was making the frocks live up to F.Scott Fitzgerald's vision

Mulligan herself appeared a pale shadow of her glamorous character, Daisy Buchanan, in a drab black frock, although Isla Fisher looked wonderful in pale pink.

Luckily, the stunning 1920s inspired frocks, with their beading and sparkle, more than made up for Mulligan's lack of pizzazz and epitomised the glamour of the roaring twenties, although according to Prada herself, glamour wasn't really a consideration during the design process.

'When I read [the book], it was psychological,' she told British Vogue's website. 'It was not about glamour for me. It was a real [study of] personality, very internalised.

'It was meant to be about light. It became about money, because Luhrmann wanted to show her as the most beautiful and rich woman on earth.'

According to Martin, the real challenge wasn't making gowns that were historically accurate but ensuring they lived up to F.Scott Fitzgeral's characters.

'The reality is that from 1920, I could find a photo or a fashion illustration that would support almost any choice that we've made in the film,' Martin revealed.

Support: Singer Katy Perry and actress Maggie Gyllenhaal both attended the launch wearing Prada frocks

Inspiration: Many of the gowns in the collection were inspired by past collections for Prada and Miu Miu

'But we are not making a documentary. We are trying to express a story in a way in which Fitzgerald's visceral modernity is able to transgress the plane of the screen.'

Although the fabulous frocks have already appeared on the silver screen, they made their public debut during a launch party for the exhibition, which attracted some of Hollywood's glitziest stars.

Among them were Carey Mulligan, who as Daisy, was lucky enough to wear the frocks and British socialite, Alexa Chung.

Also on the guest list was Isla Fisher, who looked fresh-faced and pretty in a pale pink Prada dress, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who also plumped for Prada.
