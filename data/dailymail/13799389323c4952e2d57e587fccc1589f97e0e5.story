Crisis? What crisis? That memorable slogan from the Winter of Discontent 35 years ago has been England’s defiant mantra this week as they have grappled with autumn angst.

In 1979, the crisis in question involved political unrest that ultimately brought down a government. Even in a rugby context, five defeats on the bounce will not lead to protests in the streets, let alone a change of regime, but Stuart Lancaster needs his team to turn a corner, to add substance to their insistence that the wheels are not coming off the Sweet Chariot.

The head coach, his assistants and players have been indignant in the face of escalating criticism that has come their way following narrow defeats by New Zealand and South Africa in the first two fixtures of this QBE series at Twickenham. Lancaster emphatically dismissed the notion that England are in crisis, but that will be the state of affairs if there is an almighty upset at HQ on Saturday.

A match with Samoa that was supposed to offer the chance for experimentation from a position of strength instead looms as a game in which the bottom line is all that matters. Granted, the hosts could do with a barnstorming performance, but ‘result’ is the box that absolutely has to be ticked.

From an English perspective, the prospect of a shock at the hands of Saturday’s Pacific island visitors doesn’t bear thinking about. These teams have met only six times —three at Twickenham and three during World Cups. The last contest, four years ago, yielded an unconvincing 26-13 win for an England team managed by Martin Johnson, while the side whom the former lock led to World Cup glory in 2003 could only trump Samoa by the same modest margin.

Based on relative playing numbers and resources, this should be a colossal mismatch, but it is likely to be no such thing. The hosts are low on confidence and cohesion, with a reshuffled line-up, while their opponents will be fuelled by the desire to make a big statement on the grand stage. They had considered boycotting the game in protest at mismanagement by their union, but instead they will wear black armbands to make their point.

A groundswell of support from fellow players in other countries —including England — will surely serve to galvanise the Samoans, making them especially dangerous. Having been pilloried by their own prime minister and threatened for taking a stand, they are playing for their livelihoods and the prospects of future generations of Polynesian talent. It is a potent driving force.

Yet, there is motivation and desperation in the home camp, too. England are grumpy, determined and focused. They know that trouble on Saturday would equate to a potentially terminal jolt to their hopes of building momentum ahead of the World Cup. They must win, with a degree of conviction, in order to lift the siege and push on towards the pivotal autumn finale against Australia in good heart.

SIX - The number of times Samoa have played against, and lost to, England 

216 - Points scored by England against Samoa — an average of 36 per game 

14 - The number of England-based players in Samoa’s squad

11 - Samoa’s world ranking — one place behind Japan and six behind England

10 - Samoa have never lost by fewer than 10 points when facing England

26 - England have never scored fewer than 26 points in this fixture 

THREE - Since November 2012, Samoa have beaten three Six Nations sides — Wales, Scotland and Italy twice

There was commendable honesty from forwards coach Graham Rowntree on Friday as he assessed the state of the national team. ‘Our performances have been well documented — we have a lot of things to put right,’ he said. ‘It’s been a tough week, one of the hardest I’ve experienced. There have been some very frank discussions. We’re really unhappy with our two defeats. Although they’re by a total of six points, we know we’re under-performing and that hurts. There were plenty of harsh words from everyone.’

Asked where the two defeats have left England, Rowntree added: ‘Thoroughly p***ed off. We spent two-and-a-half days sulking as players and coaches and then you have to move on, saying we’re not that bad. The lads are desperate to fulfil what ability they have.’

In Rowntree’s area of influence, the rejigged home pack will expect to gain a degree of supremacy. For all their failings, England have been able to rely on a strong set-piece game and an effective rolling maul. Those weapons are bound to hurt the Samoans, although the likes of prop Census Johnston and flankers Maurie Fa’asavalu and Jack Lam are equipped to give the hosts some trouble up front.

There will be a heavy focus on the work of Lancaster’s altered back row. James Haskell can provide an energising influence and assist Chris Robshaw in solving the perennial breakdown problems, while Ben Morgan has earned the right to lead the cavalry charge of English ball-carriers, which must be much more productive than of late.

Further back, England have shifted their resources to create space for George Ford’s first start at 10. However, former Test players have led loud protests about the midfield balance, with the rookie fly-half expected to supply predatory wide runners in tandem with the Saracens duo, Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt.

Those two were Lancaster’s first centre pair in February 2012, but the concern is that they are adept at holding the line rather than unleashing it. The coaches’ decision to entrust goal-kicking duties to Ford is a correct one, designed to expose him to the full scope of a Test conductor’s remit. Yet they have been damned for their refusal to demote Farrell, who has been short of form and match-fitness.

Having been moved one place to inside centre, the man whose recent performances have prompted such debate and concern appeared relaxed about his predicament, saying: ‘The main thing is the team. We’ve not worked as well as we did in the Six Nations but we will get back to that quickly. I’ve got to cut out a couple of clear errors and then I think we’ll be all right.’

It sounds simple. In truth, for Farrell and for England, a tricky and tense occasion is in prospect. Defeat would mean the crisis is horribly, undeniably real.
