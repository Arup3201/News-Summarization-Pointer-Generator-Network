Generous young men are spreading happiness across America by doing good deeds for strangers.

The three boys, identified only as Kyle, Andrew and Robert, have created Give Back Films on YouTube.

The trio, who describe themselves at the start of their videos as 'being a little bit more fortunate than some people have' set out to help other members of their community in Utah.

It is not clear where the three men get 
the money from to fund their altruism, but the YouTube videos have 
received hundreds of thousands of views.

'Can I interest you in some free gas?' Kyle leans in to the window of a car parked in the garage

'Have you just won the lottery?' This shocked driver asks Kyle as he pays for the truck and car's bills

In their latest good deed, they paid for petrol at a filling station in Atlanta, Georgia, and the reactions of the lucky recipients are heartbreaking.

Kyle approaches the car while his friends film him asking 'excuse me guys, can I interest you in some free gas today?'

The disbelieving customers ask 'did you just win the lottery?' as he pays for a truck and another car at once.

One woman, who received $40 (£24) gives a heartfelt thanks to the camera and another man, with his two-year-old daughter in the car is incredulous as he reveals money is tight until his wife gets paid next Friday.

He also opens up and tells a heartbreaking tale to the generous guys about how he lost another daughter at two weeks old in a car accident.

In a new video every Monday, the friends think up imaginative new ways to help others.

Heartbreaking: This man opens up about his life after the boys pay for his petrol and reveal money is tight for him and his wife

Last week, the group gave a waitress at International House of Pancakes a $200 (£124) tip.

It was only after they had handed over the money, that she said she was a mother of two children, aged five and nine months. 

Another of their 'Good Samaritan' videos shows them driving into a drive through and paying for their meal as well as the car behind.

Grateful families give them the thumbs up and shout 'thanks' as they enjoy the free food.

By the end of the day, everyone that drove through was 'paying it forward' and buying the car behind their meal as well. 

Overwhelmed: This happy woman has her $40 of petrol paid for

The first ever video Give Back Films uploaded was a touching idea to give $100 (£60) to a homeless person.

Kyle approaches several people on the street and hands over a $100 dollar bill.

One man gets down on his knees to thank the young man and another overwhelmed woman hugs him.

Another man says the money has changed his life as his backpack and wallet was stolen just the day before - including his driving licence and ID. The pair had been laid off from work with 11 other men.
