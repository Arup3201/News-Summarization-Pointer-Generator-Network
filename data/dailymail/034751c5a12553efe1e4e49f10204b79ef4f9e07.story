Council tax inspectors will be stripped of their right to barge into your home, under new laws published today.

Thousands of officials from the Valuation Office Agency, part of HMRC, have the automatic right to enter homes and businesses to value them for council tax and business rates.

But the law will be changed within weeks to force inspectors to go before a judge if they want to force their way in.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to cut the number of ‘snoopers’ with powers of entry

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to cut the number of ‘snoopers’ with powers of entry.

Mr Pickles said: ‘I am a firm believer that we should be cutting down on the number of Government snoopers who can barge into a person’s home.

‘This Government has clamped down on the overuse and abuse of snooping with over 300 powers of entry already being abolished as well as stopping spy cars and bin snoopers.

‘We are now curtailing the powers of council tax inspectors. This complements the steps we have taken to stop a council tax revaluation and terminate the tax revaluation database to protect hard-working people from unwanted tax rises.’

There are nearly 3,000 VOA officials who can use entry powers to force their way into someone’s home or a business premises, the Department for Communities and Local Government said.

The law will be changed within weeks to force inspectors to go before a judge if they want to force their way in.

The change in the law would force them to obtain access with the consent of the owner and, if this cannot be secured, go before a judge to make their case.

Officials said the use of a tribunal would give greater scrutiny to entry attempts.

The law will be changed using powers created by the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act and will require a vote in Parliament. It is expected to come into force in March.

It follows a review of powers of entry laws by the government. Ministers have pledged to reduce the number of powers to enter people’s homes to a minimum.

A report earlier this month revealed that an army of almost 20,000 council busybodies has the right to barge into homes and businesses – including bizarre powers to check on pot plants and fridges.

Big Brother Watch found a staggering 1,065 pieces of invasive legislation that let bureaucrats inspect someone’s home, often without a warrant or police escort.

Meaningless regulations include those allowing officials to investigate whether any imported pot plants have a ‘passport’ - documents showing they do not carry any diseases or insects that could devastate British wildlife if released into the environment.

Snoopers can also inspect a property to make sure ‘illegal or unregulated hypnotism’ is not taking place under a law from 1952, look at the energy rating on fridges, and check hedges are not too tall.
