This disturbing image appears to show two headless bodies dumped on the streets of Mexico City.

In the photograph, two bodies - both wrapped in plastic and bound with tape - can be seen lying on the side of a road in Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico City.

Both of the unidentified corpses appear to be headless in the image.

According to local media, the crime scene was first cordoned off on Sunday morning - shortly after the bodies were discovered.

Two bodies were dumped wrapped in plastic and bound in tape were discovered on the streets of Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico city on Sunday. Neither have been identified

They were found in the Nezahualcoyotl neighborhood  - an area on the outskirts of Mexico City that is known for its high crime rate and gang culture.

The two appear to be further victims of drugs cartels - which are common in the area.

Mexico City and its surrounding states have long be gripped by violence on the streets - with much of it linked to members of drugs cartels who battle over their 'patches'.

Many towns in the area now have groups of vigilantes who attempt to enforce the law on such groups.

Only last week, Mexican authorities confirmed four human heads were found in a town in Michoacan - a state west of Mexico City.

The western state is home to hundreds of vigilantes  - many of which sprang up a year ago to drive out members of drugs cartel the Knights Templar.

A federal official said police investigators also found a threatening note along with the human remains - but wouldn't reveal its content.

Last week four human heads were found in Zacan, Michoacan. The state is home to hundreds of vigilantes - many of whom are attempting to drive out members of drugs cartels

He confirmed the bodies belonged to four men aged between 22 and 55.

Vigilantes began rising up against the Knights Templar in February 2013. Last month, the Mexican government effectively legalized the movement after an agreement was reached with group leaders to incorporate the armed civilian groups into quasi-military groups.

Last September, six severed human heads were found over two days in the town of Los Reyes - also in Michoacan.

The heads all belonged to males and had bullet wounds, reports at the time suggested.

Local people in the area have set up a self-defence force to protect against the influence of the drug gangs.

However, some residents of the area have reacted in protest at the presence of the groups. Last Thursday, at least three trailer trucks were set alight when 600 arrived in Paracuaro, Michoacan.

At the time, residents said they oppose the vigilantes because they are forcing young men to join them.

At the end of last year, officers began excavating 28 graves in the town of La Barca, Jalisco - after 62 bodies were discovered in a mass grave.
