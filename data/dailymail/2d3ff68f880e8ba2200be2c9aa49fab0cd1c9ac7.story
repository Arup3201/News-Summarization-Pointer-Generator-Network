A jury has awarded almost $14 million to a suburban Chicago woman who sued her doctor over a debilitating stroke she suffered after taking the popular birth control drug Yasmin.

Lawyers for Mariola Zapalski, of Elmwood Park, say the stroke occurred 13 days after she began taking the drug, paralyzing her left side and causing permanent brain injury.

According to ABC Local, the 37-year-old was prescribed the pill to deal with irregular bleeding in 2007.

Yasmin prevents ovulation and also cause changes in your cervical and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus. Last year the FDA changed the warning label on Yasmin and other estrogen containing birth control pills, warning of an increased risk for blood clots

She is now wheelchair-bound, paralyzed on her left side, unable to fully communicate and requires around-the-clock care.

Her husband and her attorneys hope the verdict will serve as a victory not just for them, but for patients' rights everywhere.

'Nobody should have to go through what we did,' said Rafal Zapalski.

Defendant Dr. Zbigniew Aniol declined to comment Saturday.

Friday's verdict came after a two-week trial in Cook County Circuit Court.

A $2.5 million settlement in the same matter was reached a month ago with Resurrection Medical Center - the hospital that referred Zapalski to the defendant.

Drugmaker Bayer has also faced lawsuits from women claiming the contraceptive caused blood clots that led to serious health consequences.

The company stands by the drug and says it is safe if used as directed.

Last year they changed their packaging to include warnings of the increased risk of blood clots.
