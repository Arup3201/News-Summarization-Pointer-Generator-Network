Sydney siege victim Joel Herat has returned to work at the  reopened Lindt cafe on Friday  just three months after he was held hostage inside the Sydney store along with 17 other people.

A bear-hug from the premier heralded the start of the 21-year-old's first shift back at the Martin Place cafe, which has been restored to its former glory with the shelves adorned with chocolates in time for Easter.

Of those staff members caught up in the fatal siege, only Mr Herat chose to return to work on reopening day, but Daily Mail Australia has been told by Lindt management 'that several others are expected to take up shifts in the coming weeks, it will be entirely their decision when to come back'.

The boss of Lindt Australia wants the reopening of the Martin Place cafe in Sydney to be a 'happy day' after months of sadness following the siege, adding that counsellors would be on site for staff if needed.

The cafe's doors reopened to the public at 10am on Friday - around the same time a shotgun-wielding Man Haron Monis ordered the doors locked shut on December 15 last year.

Monis held 18 staff and customers captive for 16 hours before the siege was ended in a hail of gunfire, which claimed his life and the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson.

NSW Premier Mike Baird visited the café before it officially opened on Friday morning, where he spoke with staff and gave Mr Herat a hug.

'Joel is in there today - I don't think any of us could imagine what that would be like and I said to him that the city was very proud of him,' Mr Baird told journalists in Martin Place.

'Proud of him being able to be strong in spite of what he went through and that's very clear the thoughts in relation to Tori and Katrina are strong in there.

'There's a strong sense of comradeship that says we can get through this together, we are stronger together, just as the city has marched forward today.'

The fact the reopening coincides with another celebratory time, Easter, was not lost on Operations Manager Sarah Anderson, after the events 10 days before last Christmas.

'Absolutely it's an important time - we are very positive and there's a great feeling of support,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Another Lindt employee, Lauren Tench, was off shift that fateful day but she wore a beaming smile as she went through last minute checks of table settings.  

'It's good to see everyone again, definitely great to see the people waiting outside for us to open,' she said.

'Just before Easter, that means everything to us.' 

Former Lindt employee Karen Cox, who worked alongside Tori Johnson for many months helping to set up the store in Martin Place, will host a private function at the Lindt Café on Saturday for 30 people, to pay homage to the late manager and also remember Katrina Dawson.

Ms Cox left Lindt in November of last year, a month before the fatal siege, but returned on Friday for the reopening.

'For me I was very, very, shaky when I was first standing in line and walking into the store but I knew I had to do it because I was supporting the Lindt team,' she said.

'Tori was a wonderful person, I knew him from the things I'd implemented for the store, he always took care of us, even working with Tori implementing the store I knew how lovely he was, he was chosen because how brilliant he was.

'I knew him very well and I also knew Katrina very well, as well.'

Ms Cox said Mr Herat's decision to come back to work straight away took a lot of courage.

'Just wonderful, they all decided on their own if or when they wanted to come back, I think it's a wonderful thing that they want to and the fact Lindt has supported them.

'It just proves how strong we are as an Australian community and that we all bond together like we did when it happened.

'When it first happened we were devastated, very sombre, but they are in there today and they are working their butts off.'

One of the many customers waiting outside - first in line - was Praveen Swarup.

'It's about the solidarity,' he said.

'I'm not intentionally here to be the first person - it's to be here with everybody and to show our support and that nothing will dampen our spirits.

'We wanted this cafe to reopen, it's in a premium location and we love our city and I enjoyed visiting this before,' he added. 

Security was tight but heavily armed police stood aside, mostly out of view but holding a watching brief across all corners of Martin Place.

Standing at the back of the line of up to 100 people, with a bouquet of flowers was Alan Sexgon. 

'Terrorism will fail as long as the people experiencing it don't let it divide them - we are very proud to be Australian and are united,' he said 

'I'm very surprised I'm the only one bringing flowers but I think the flowers say something they are very important.'  

Martin Place was home to a sea of floral tributes in the week following the fatal siege

AMay date has been set for a two-week inquest into the deaths of Katrina Dawson, Tori Johnson and gunman Man Monis in the Lindt Cafe siege

Two plaques were unveiled at the store on Friday to commemorate the lives of Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson.

Lindt Australia chief executive Steve Loane said Mr Johnson's plaque contained the image of a sunflower and Ms Dawson's the image of a tree - the symbol of the Katrina Dawson Foundation.

'Let's just make it a really happy day, and hopefully the staff have a great day and by the end of it we're all in a really good place,' Mr Loane told ABC Radio on Friday. 

Mr Loane said the company was committed to making 'today a happy day to celebrate that we're back and we're open with the support of all the staff'. 

'But really they're in a great mood and they're ready to go, and they really want to welcome customers in,' Mr Loane said.

Staff members voted on the return date and the 10am opening. Regular trading hours begin on Saturday.  

The store has undergone a refit since the events of last December and workmen have plastered over bullet holes and other damage that was suffered at the dramatic end of the 16-hour siege.  

It follows a one-day session in January that heard Ms Dawson was killed by ricocheting fragments of a police bullet or bullets after officers stormed the Sydney cafe following the execution of Mr Johnson by Monis

Renovations have been carried out on the Martin Place cafe since the tragedy

Labor Leader Luke Foley will take time from the NSW election campaign to wish Lindt staff  well later in the day. 

Premier  Baird, who visited the cafe at 9.30am, recently told AAP he was still uncomfortable passing by the cafe, which is nearby to his office and state parliament.

'I can't really look at the cafe without feeling these pangs of despair at what took place,' he said.

'I know over time that will heal but ... the impacts are still pretty raw.' 

A May date has been set for a two-week inquest into the deaths of Ms Dawson, Mr Johnson and gunman Monis in the Lindt Cafe siege.

It follows a one-day session in January that heard Ms Dawson was killed by ricocheting fragments of a police bullet or bullets after officers stormed the Sydney cafe following the execution of Mr Johnson by Monis.

The first part of the hearing, which will run from May 25 until June 5, will focus on the background of Monis and related issues, a spokesman for the NSW Coroner's Court said on Wednesday.

More than 60 witnesses and experts are expected to appear during the entire cafe inquest, which is being presided over by State Coroner Michael Barnes and will run throughout the year.

Findings are expected to be delivered in early 2016.
