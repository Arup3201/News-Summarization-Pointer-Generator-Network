Scotland Yard swooped on Dover yesterday and arrested two men returning from Syria on suspicion of terror offences.

The men, aged 26 and 44, were held at around 11pm by the Metropolitan Police Force’s Counter Terrorism Command.

The duo were taken into custody as they landed at the Kent port on a ferry from Calais.

The pair are facing questions at a police station in south London and two addresses in west London and one in Hertfordshire are being searched as part of the investigation.

It is believed that one line of inquiry is whether they had travelled to or had links with terrorist activities in Syria.

Hundreds of would-be British jihadists have gone to the war-torn Middle Eastern state to join fighting there, and UK authorities recently launched a campaign to encourage Muslim women to inform on relatives they suspect of planning to travel there.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘They were travelling from Calais into the country. It is believed to be Syrian related.

‘On Tuesday 3 June, at approximately 11pm, officers from SO15 Counter Terrorism Command arrested two men aged 26 and 44 at Dover on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

‘They are currently in custody at south London police station.

‘Officers are searching two addresses in west London and an address in Hertfordshire as part of the investigation under Schedule 5.’

In a separate case two other men were arrested last week at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of terrorism linked to Syria.

One – a 19-year-old – was held last Saturday on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism while the other – a 20-year-old – in an unrelated case, was arrested for allegedly sending money or property overseas to assist terrorism in Syria.

The arrests come in the wake of plans by the government to charge British subjects and residents with terrorist offences when they return home under new laws to limit the threat of attack in the UK.

The Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy Nick Clegg said that they wanted to ensure ‘peace of mind for all that live here’ as they unveiled a raft of new laws in the Queen’s Speech aimed at criminal gangs, people traffickers and child abusers.

The new laws would allow people suspected of committing terror offences overseas to be prosecuted in the UK as if the offences had occurred on British soil.

The government warned Syria is now a 'breeding ground for terrorists’ after senior Whitehall officials said jihadists returning from fighting in the bloody civil war pose the biggest risk to UK security since 9/11.

Government sources suggest around 2,000 Europeans fighting in Syria, including at least 200 already known to the British security services.

It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad.
