Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky died penniless and £300m in debt, including £46m owed to HMRC 

Boris Berezovsky, once known as Russia's second richest man, died penniless and in debt, including owing the taxman £46million.

The former tycoon, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, was worth an estimated £1.9 billion.

But after he was found dead it was revealed Berezovsky died penniless and with debts of more than £300million - including £46million owed to the British taxman. 

Sitting at the High Court, Mr Justice Morgan said his estate was insolvent. He said because Mr Berezovsky was a debtor unable to pay his debts, his estate became the debtor and was now insolvent.

The next stage of the process would be a creditors' meeting. 

Accountants Grant Thornton were appointed to handle most of the administration of the estate and told the court that HM Revenue and Customs officials had calculated that the estate had a tax debt of £46 million. 

The 67-year-old one time billionaire was found hanged at his ex-wife's £20million home in Ascot in Berkshire in March 2013.

His family do not believe he killed himself and last year a coroner recorded an open verdict into his death. 

His death has been shrouded in mystery, with his daughter previously claiming the Russian government could be responsible and last year Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, claimed he did not believe the Russian oligarch was actually dead.  

Probate records reveal that he died without a will and left an estate valued at 'nil' in England and Wales.

In May 2014 another High Court judge had analysed litigation involving the estate and Mr Berezovsky's former partner Elena Gorbunova.

Ms Gorbunova had become embroiled in a High Court battle with Mr Berezovsky in late 2012 - after complaining that she had not been given millions he had promised.

And Mr Justice Mann had been told - at a High Court hearing in London in May - that following Mr Berezovsky's death Ms Gorbunova had claimed an interest in two French properties.

Mr Justice Mann had heard that ownership of the properties - one a chateau - lay within a 'corporate structure'.

The judge had said it appeared that Mr Berezovsky had not asserted a 'directly-held' interest but possibly a 'beneficial' interest as a trustee.

He had heard that an application had been made for permission to sell the properties and lawyers for Ms Gorbunova said an agreement had been reached with some companies involved in the corporate ownership structure.

Ms Gorbunova and Mr Berezovsky had two children and she had been his partner until 2012, Mr Justice Mann had been told.

Mr Berezovsky had also previously lost a multi-billion pound High Court fight with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich in 2012.

Just seven months before his death, a judge dismissed a series of claims he made against Mr Abramovich. He lost a £1.8billion damages claim over rightful ownership of the oil group Sibneft and was also left with an estimated £100million legal bill in the aftermath of the case.

HMRC declined to comment on how the money would be repaid or if it would have to be written off.
