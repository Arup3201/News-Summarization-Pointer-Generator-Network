This is the moment an eagle-eyed photographer spotted a tiny spider spinning a  web inside the hole of a leaf.

The little arachnid was seen settling down inside the leaf on a forest path in Burgundy, France, after a caterpillar dug out the perfect habitat.

Photographer Burtrand Kulik spotted the miracle of nature unfolding in front of him and captured the tender moment up close.

Mr Kulik, 34, said: 'When I approached I saw a very little spider inside, it was a real present for me. A great meeting.

The hole in the leaf was made by a caterpillar before the spider discovered it was the perfect size for his home

'I think that a caterpillar made this hole in the leaf, before the spider decided to make a web inside.

'Nature is amazing and when we open our eyes we can see some great things.'

Mr Kulik used a Canon 100mm 2/8 macro-lens to capture the image - meaning he could pick up much more intricate detail.

He said: 'When I saw this leaf, I immediately new that it could be nice for taking a good macro picture. I have taken lots of macro pictures and this kind of opportunity is unusual.

'The light was really nice because sunlight was just behind the leaf and for macro photography it's very important to have a good light.'

He had to be extremely patient to get so close to nature, and said he was always looking for the perfect picture.

He added: 'I do lots of macro photography and when I take pictures, time stops. If I don't have my camera with me, I miss what is in front of my eyes everyday.'

The photographer, who is also a concert violinist, said: 'Photography is a means of expression, and whether it's a camera or a violin in my hands, the important thing for me is to go in search of colours and materials, and communicate to others what touches me.

'I like watching nature before taking my pictures and I try to feel my pictures before making them. Photography is a real passion and it's growing more and more.'
