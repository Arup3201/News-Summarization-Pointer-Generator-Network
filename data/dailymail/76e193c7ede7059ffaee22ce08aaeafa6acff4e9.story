As the Premier League announced on Wednesday that they would be launching a new European U21 competition, Sportsmail runs you through the eight players at English clubs to look out for.

Lewis Baker

Club: Chelsea Age: 19 Position: Midfield

He scored 17 goals for the Under 21 side last season and Jose Mourinho has taken responsibility for turning him into a future England international. Baker is a set-piece expert with an eye for goal from midfield.

Ryan Ledson

Club: Everton Age: 17 Position: Midfield

He was captain of the England Under 17 team which triumphed at the European Championships in May - he even scored a penalty during the shootout victory against Holland in the final. Classy and composed from the middle of the park.

Buomesca Tue Na Bangna

Club: Fulham Age: 21 Position: Midfield

Injuries have curtailed what seemed a certain breakthrough at senior level but the pacey Portugal youth international is still tipped to make an impact at Craven Cottage.

Hamza Choudhury 

Club: Leicester Age: 16 Position: Midfield

He’s a holding midfielder who boasts craft as well as graft and has already attracted admiring eyes from the upper echelons of the Premier League. His Marouane Fellaini mop makes him easy to spot.

Thierry Ambrose

Club: Manchester City Age: 17 Position: Striker

A French youth international who arrived from Auxerre, he scored 22 goals for City Under 18s last season and has now graduated to the Under 21s, where he continues to find the back of the net.

Cameron King

Club: Norwich Age: 19 Position: Midfield

He missed last season because of injury but the Scottish youth international has returned to form this season – he scored twice as the Under 21s beat Spurs 3-1 in front of 10,000 fans this week – and has now made his senior debut in the League Cup.

Liam Agnew

Club: Sunderland Age: 19 Position: Midfield

The hometown boy likes to get forward from the middle of the pitch and was involved with Gus Poyet’s senior side over the summer, winning a squad number for the Premier League season.

Elliot Lee

Club: West Ham Age: 19 Position: Striker

The son of former England midfielder Rob, Lee has scored a bucket load of goals for West Ham’s development side and has been involved in the senior set-up, where it is hoped he will continue to push for a place on the bench this season.
