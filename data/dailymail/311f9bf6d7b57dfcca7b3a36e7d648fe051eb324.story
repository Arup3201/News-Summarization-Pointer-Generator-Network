A businessman who spent £1million building a classic World War II Spitfire with parts found around the world has spoken of his joy at seeing it take to the skies after 13 years.

The iconic Second World War fighter plane was meticulously pieced together  after its fuselage was rescued by 51-year-old Martin Phillips a decade ago.

Mr Phillips, from Newton St Cyres, Exeter, had been challenged to build his own Spitfire by friends who gave him a single rivet from the aircraft.

And when he found the fuselage of a 1944 Mark IX Spitfire, RR232, in West Sussex, the restoration began in earnest.

Mr Phillips gathered more genuine Spitfire parts from around the world - including four of the Merlin engines which gave the Spitfires their unmistakable sound.

He also found a £70,000 four-bladed propeller, wing skeletons, engine parts, wing cannons, flying instruments, original seats and components.

One of its wings came from a Spitfire that crashed near Exeter Airport and lay for decades in a hedge near a pub until it was salvaged.

Last month, 13 years after the challenge the 
gleaming Spitfire took off from the soon-to-close Filton aerodrome 
outside Bristol for the first time since the 1940s.

Filton has been synonymous with aviation development since before World War One when the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company set up a flying ground there in 1911.

The firm developed the iconic Bristol Fighter and the airfield was used by the Royal Flying Corps during the war.

Between the wars, the firm became Bristol Aeroplane Company and built aero engines, while Hurricane fighters were based at Filton.

During World War Two, BAC expanded massively, producing the Bristol Blenheim and Beaufighter, two medium-range twin-engine bombers.

Spitfires were also based at the grass airfield for a time following heavy bombing of Bristol.

After the war, Bristol continued to develop planes, by now branching out into commercial aviation and extending the concrete runway to cater for larger airliners.

Filton's crowning glory was arguably its role in the development of Concorde, in the 1960s and 1970s, by now under control of the British Aircraft Corporation. Pictured above is the famous supersonic passenger jet visiting the airfield for the last time in 2003.

In 1977 BAE acquired the airfield and it was recently used to produce the Bae 146 small airliner.

Mr Phillips, who owns the Spitfire, said the expensive and painstaking restoration project with his 50-strong team had been worth it.

He
said: 'Many times I thought the project wouldn't ever be completed. But we never gave up the ghost.

'The Spitfire is something that makes
Britain a great nation. I am humbled that 18-year-old kids went up in 
them and died in them.'

The occasion was a poignant one as 
Filton aerodrome was decommissioned by BAE after more than a 
century of aviation there. It closed on December 31.

BAE
Systems, which said the site was no longer economically viable, is 
selling the airfield for housing and business development. 

Crowds
of aviation and history enthusiasts lined the A38 road which borders 
the airfield to watch the Spitfire take off, while BAE staff watched 
from beside the runway.

They
were also there to see the last visit to the airfield from the Airbus 
A380 superjumbo, which was developed at Filton and is the world's 
largest commercial aircraft.

Mr Phillips said: 'To see her take to the skies today has been extraordinary, for it to happen at the same time as an A380's final visit to Filton, 
has made this a sad but historic day.

'I think it's a terrible shame that this famous old airfield is to close.'

Former Rolls-Royce engineer John 
Hart, who has worked as chief engineer on the Spitfire restoration for 
the last two-and-a-half years, said seeing the Spitfire and the A380 
together on the runway that is also still overlooked by Concorde was 
'quite a sight' for aviation enthusiasts.

He said: 'It's funny to think the last aeroplane to be put together here at Filton has turned out to be a Spitfire.'

Filton
aerodrome, which has one of the longest and widest runways in the 
country, witnessed the first test flights of Concorde and was where 
American soldiers injured in D-Day were taken to before being treated at
Bristol's Frenchay hospital.

The West Country's aviation industry grew up around the airfield, which developed an international reputation.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vulcan bombers were stationed there, and the last Concorde to fly, Concorde 216, is parked there.

There are plans for an aviation museum on the site, hosting both Concorde and the Bristol Aero Collection of British-designed aeroplane memorabilia from the last century.

The final flights from Filton will took off in December, before the aerodrome was decommissioned.
