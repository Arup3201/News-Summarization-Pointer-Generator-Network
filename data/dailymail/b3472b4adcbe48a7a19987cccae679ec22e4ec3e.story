Suspect: Police have arrested Sheldon Bernard Chase

A mentally disturbed man on the run since apparently killing his elderly grandmother two days ago has been caught, the FBI has said.

Sheldon Bernard Chase, 22, was arrested in Spokane, Washington, following the shootings at the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana, in which two others were also killed.

Chase is suspected of opening fire with a rifle on Tuesday afternoon to kill his grandmother, Gloria Sarah Goes Ahead Cummins, 80, his cousin, 21-year-old Levon Driftwood, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Rueben Jefferson.

The arrest follows a day-long search in which police, game wardens and tribal authorities combed county roads looking for Chase.

Schools on reservations in southeastern Montana and western North Dakota were closed and residents stayed indoors for safety during the search.

Eric Barnhart, FBI supervisor in Billings, said that investigators are attempting to piece together what led to the shooting.

'At this point, we still don't know,' he said, declining to release any details about the arrest. 'With some history of mental illness, that's an X factor.'

The shootings happened at Cummins's home about 10 miles outside Lodge Grass, a town of 500 people near the Wyoming border.

Tragic: Police remove a body from the house where three Indian people were shot dead in Lodge Grass, Montana

Officers remove another body from the property after the shooting on Tuesday

It is a few miles south of the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument - the
site which marks the spot where Lieutenant Colonel George 
Armstrong Custer and his cavalry unit died fighting Indian forces in 
1876.

Chase lives with his uncle in a mobile home about 30 metres from the modest log house, city clerk Cody Not Afraid said.

Police tape stretched across Cummins's property yesterday and Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officers kept onlookers from approaching.

It was unclear what led to the shootings or how Chase was identified as a suspect.

Earlier yesterday, Barnhart had said that authorities considered Chase to be armed and extremely dangerous.

People in Lodge Grass described the victims and the suspect as coming from a prominent, well-respected family in the community.

Chase moved there about a year ago from North Dakota, where he had grown up, and was attending Little Bighorn College about 20 miles away in Crow Agency, said Reverend Jim Antoine, the priest at Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church.

Crow Tribal Chairman Black Eagle said: 'I don't know him. He is not a tribal member, but his mother is a tribal member. His father is from North Dakota. That's all I know.

'We are doing as well as we can trying to comprehend what happened today.

'We have been deeply affected and have asked Indian Health Services to provide grief counselling for this tragedy.'

Chairman Black Eagle added in a 
statement on his Facebook page on Tuesday: 'In the coming days we need 
to pull together even tighter as a community and support these families 
in every way possible.'
