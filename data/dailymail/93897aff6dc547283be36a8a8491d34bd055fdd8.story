A Tory MP and his estranged wife are involved in an extraordinary secret war on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage.

Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, used the website to accuse her husband of ‘abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage’ even though he claimed to be a ‘devout Christian’.

Shortly afterwards the damaging entry was deleted and the Pritchards’ tit-for-tat Wiki war continued as the account of their split was changed on the MP’s profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events.

Conflicting claims: Conservative MP Mark Pritchard shown here during a parliamentary debate, admits to sending the text but claims he had already told his wife face-to-face that he wanted a divorce

The Mail on Sunday has established most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the Houses of Parliament where both work – Mrs Pritchard as her husband’s Commons office manager.

Even more remarkably, some of the anonymous Wiki entries appear to involve a code which echo opera buff Mr Pritchard’s role as treasurer of the Parliamentary opera group.

One of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as Figaro2000, after Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro.

Others which sided with Mrs Pritchard were made by La Verdad – Spanish for the truth.

Former marketing director Mr Pritchard, 46, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, and his 47-year-old American-born wife have lived apart since April. In a statement yesterday, he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her ‘in person’.

He said: ‘I informed my ex-wife, in person, that I was going to file for divorce the day I left home. Over subsequent days, I confirmed that decision through another conversation, a legal letter, and by text.

'Since then, friends claim she may have abused the Wiki site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims. I did not edit any item on my Wiki page.’

The ‘text’ claim was added to Mr Pritchard’s profile on August 1: ‘The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout Christian, abandoning Sondra and the marriage on 29th April by text.’

Mr Pritchard’s fightback started on August 6, when allegations against him were deleted by Figaro2000.

The next day, an account of their divorce changed back in favour of Mrs Pritchard. It said: ‘Contrary to inaccurate press reports, [she] filed the divorce petition citing “Unreasonable Behavior”.[sic]’

A battle raged over this and the ‘text’ entry again on August 8. Eventually a user, Taggy456, had the last word by deleting reference to Mr Pritchard’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’.

At present, there appears to be a truce, with no reference at all to Mrs Pritchard on the MP’s profile.

Mr Pritchard declined to comment on whether he was Figaro2000. Sondra Pritchard could not be reached for comment last night.
