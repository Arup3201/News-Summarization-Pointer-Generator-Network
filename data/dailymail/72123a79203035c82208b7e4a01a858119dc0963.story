Still smiling? An upstate New York school board president stepped down Tuesday after he was caught calling a parent 'chubby wubby' on an open mic last night during a board meeting

A New York school board president who described a PTA parent as 'chubby wubby' during a public meeting has resigned.

Ray Cote's resignation was announced at a Mahopac Board of Education meeting Tuesday night, where parents had vowed to demand he step down regardless of whether he apologized.

He did so, nonetheless. Cote called words his 'inappropriate' and said they 'do not reflect my feelings or attitudes.'

The school district's attorney says Cote also withdrew his candidacy for re-election.

Parents of school children in the tiny New York State hamlet immediately called for Cote, who's led the board since 2011, after his comments last month.

They were videotaped and broadcast on a local cable access station and live-streamed via the Internet.

The school board accepted the apology in a statement, reports lohud.com:

'The Mahopac Board of Education acknowledges the apology of board President Raymond Cote regarding his comments after the close of the board meeting on April 8, 2014. We are disappointed by and do not condone this lapse in judgment on the part of Mr. Cote.

'The Board of Education expects all of its members and meeting participants and attendees to act in a respectful manner. It is our commitment to move forward as a community in a positive manner and focus on the education of our children.'

As it happens: Ray Cote, pictured sitting at top in the center of the dais, was aired live and streamed online as he made the comment during the April meeting. He's been school board president since he was elected in 2011

Officials refused to ID the mother he targeted, at left, however they did say she'd been volunteering on the school board for a decade. President Cote, right, had yet to comment on the debacle by Tuesday evening.

Prior to the resignation, parents revealed their ire for the man they elected to lead the community's children.

'It 
totally tells us the he cares nothing for the community that he says he 
upholds. Nothing,' Deena Bell, who has two high schoolers in the 
district, told WABC.

The
 Journal News says Cote is a member of a diversity and sensitivity initiative
 created in March following racist tweets posted by some Mahopac 
students during a basketball game.

Former
 school board member John Molloy had already taken steps to try and 
unseat Cote in the days after his comments became publicized.

Cote's full comment in reference to the mother of six and 10-year school board volunteer was:

'A chubby wubby, she keeps getting fatter at every meeting, she really does.'

'I've
 contacted the State Education department,' said Molloy. 'We're filing a
 formal complaint. I'm waiting to take their lead but we'll file a 
formal complaint and ask to have him removed.'

'He doesn't care about the community': Mahopac parents Deena Bell (left), who first posted the footage online, and Roger Garcia, right, are both supporting Cote's removal as school board president

Taking steps: 'I've contacted the State Education department,' said former school board member John Molloy. 'We're filing a formal complaint. I'm waiting to take their lead but we'll file a formal complaint and ask to have him removed'
