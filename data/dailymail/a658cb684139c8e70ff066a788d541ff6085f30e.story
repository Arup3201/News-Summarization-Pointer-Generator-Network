Promising tennis star Heather Watson lit up Wimbledon yesterday to become the first British woman to win at Centre Court in 27 years.

The Guernsey-born 20-year-old, ranked 103rd in the world, beat a higher-ranked opponent in straight sets to provide the only ray of hope on an otherwise disappointing opening day for our players.

She defeated the Czech Republic's Iveta Benesova 6-2, 6-1 to reach the second round in front of a cheering crowd on tennis's most famous stage.

She has already got further in the tournament than five-time champion Venus Williams, who crashed out in straight sets to Russian Elena Vesnina - 6-1, 6-3.

Thousands of fans roared Miss Watson to victory on a fine day when umbrellas were needed to protect from the sun rather than to keep off the rain.

British men's number one Andy Murray will pick up the mantle today when he plays his first-round match this afternoon.

His match against Nikolay Davydenko, the third scheduled match on Centre Court, is expected to start at about 5pm.

The world number four admitted yesterday that he must 'find a way to do better and compete with the top three players' - Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

Other Brits in action today include Jamie Baker, 25, who will play Andy Roddick on Court 1, and James Ward, 25, who takes on Pablo Andujar on court 14.

In the women's competition, former British junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson, 18, lost in three sets Francesca Schiavone in her first-round match on Court 3.

Robson won the first set 6-2 against the 2010 French Open champion, but Schiavone recovered to take the last two sets, both by the margin of 6-4.

British number one Anne Keothavong, 28, was taking on Laura Pous-Tio and Elena Baltacha, also 28, was hoping to beat Karin Knapp on court 18.

Miss Watson, who was beaten in the first round of Wimbledon in 2010 and 2011, played some sparkling tennis to knock out Miss Benesova, who was ranked more than 50 places above her.

She appeared on Centre Court after a previous match between Ernests Gulbis and Tomas Berdych ended earlier than expected, with Gulbis winning in straight sets.

Miss Watson said: 'This is my first singles win at Wimbledon in both the seniors and the juniors, so it was fantastic.'

Tough test: The British No 1 is due to play Nikolay Davydenko in the third match on Centre Court

The player, who is due to meet American Jamie Lee Hampton in the next round, had to wait until the evening to see where her match would be played, giving her little time to prepare.

She said: ‘There was a lot of hanging around, at
one point I had a little nap, but I prepared myself well.

‘I had so much fun, the crowd was awesome,
I kept getting the tingles.’

Miss Watson is the first British woman to win a singles match on Centre Court since Jo Durie in 1985.

The rain held off yesterday as thousands flocked to SW19, but spectators may not enjoy a dry day today with cloudier weather and some rain or fine drizzle possible.

A beefed-up security presence is in place and police said the first day passed without any incidents.

Djokovic and Federer both made it through their first-round matches yesterday, and Nadal is due to play today.

Pleasant: Fans queuing for tickets got to laze in the sunshine as the rain stayed away

Nice start: The tournament began in fine weather and the players served up tennis to match

Crashing out: Miss Watson has already got further in the tournament than five-time champion Venus Williams, who lost in straight sets

Yesterday's winners in the ladies' singles included French Open champion Maria Sharapova.

There was little cheer for British fans watching the action on the other courts.

Former child actor Oliver Golding, 18, fell to seasoned Russian Igor Andreev and Basingstoke's Josh Goodall lost to world No 119 Grega Zemlja.

In the ladies' singles, British No 6 Naomi Broady lost to Spaniard Lourde Dominguez Lino 6-4, 7-6.

Drama: Oliver Golding loves a big stage

Struggle: Josh Goodall has never quite fulfilled his potential

Johanna Konta, born in Australia but now representing Britain, is second up on Court 17 today as she tries to pull off a shock against 28th seed Christina McHale.

Konta, 21, took the first set of the match, but McHale hit back to take the second.

Bad light forced play to be suspended at 9pm last night and the two will return to Court 17 today after Matthew Ebden finishes his game against Benoit Paire.

Out: Naomi Broady was beaten
