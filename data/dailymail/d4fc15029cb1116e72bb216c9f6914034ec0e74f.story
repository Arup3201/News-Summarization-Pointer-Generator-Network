Shouting: Chiwetel Ejiofor is a powerful actor and he does look passably like the real Patrice Lumumba

Director Joe Wright reduces to silliness a rather simplistic play about the politics of Congo in its first years after independence from Belgium in 1960.

Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as the republic’s first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. Mr Ejiofor is a powerful actor and he does look passably like the real Lumumba. But need he shout so much?

Could he not give us a more nuanced idea of the cunning any nascent democrat must possess?

Daniel Kaluuya plays Joseph Mobutu, the one-time acolyte of Lumumba who became his colonel – and his nemesis.

We see little subtlety here, none of the coldness or charisma the real Mobutu must have had.

The political power games throughout this play are feebly under-explored. There is something dismayingly naive about it – freshman student direction at best.

Dag Hammarskjold, the short-lived Secretary General of the United Nations, is played by a black actor in a ridiculous blond wig.

He is accompanied by a couple of dolly birds who could be air hostesses from a sexist Hollywood comedy. What a wasted opportunity. Hammarskjold was, for some, a brave challenger of western imperialism, for others a misguided and duplicitous liberal.

Hands up: A Season in the Congo by Aimé Césaire stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as Patrice Lumumba at the Young Vic

When I was a correspondent in New York in 1990 his name was still controversial. Why cartoon a figure who was so key to post-colonial African leaders?

Why do we have Muppet-style puppets playing a chorus from a gallery? At another point, toy parachutists float down from on high, to represent a Belgian re-invasion.

European evacuees are shown by tiny, 
Chapman Brothers-style figures being pulled across the stage. The 
American and Soviet ambassadors are done as jokes, which they most 
palpably were not.

Colour-blind casting is wilfully 
self-destructive here, failing to seize a chance to accentuate the 
arrogance of the white powers

They are also played by black actors. Why? Colour-blind casting is wilfully self-destructive here, failing to seize a chance to accentuate the arrogance of the white powers.

There was also a puppeted vulture. Don’t ask me what it was meant to represent. The final touch: a windbag witch doctor who keeps jibbering away in some African tongue.

I hope it is not giving away too much if I say that he is shot at the end. BANG! It was the one moment in a long, boring night that I felt like cheering.
