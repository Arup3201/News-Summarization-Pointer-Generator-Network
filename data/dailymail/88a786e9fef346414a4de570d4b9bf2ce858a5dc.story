At 13-years-old Brooklyn Beckham is growing up into quite the dashing young man.

And it seems that the teen is set to acquire a Hollywood smile thanks to a set of braces.

The son of football ace David and Spice Girl Victoria was seen showing off his new dental work as he arrived at LAX on Wednesday night with his family.

Smiling star: The teen has had braces put on this month, he was seen without the dental work in October

Brooklyn, who has inherited his parents' good looks, was seen leading the pack as the family arrived at the airport ahead of a flight back to London.

Upon arrival in the British capital, Victoria and the kids headed straight to Gordon and Tana Ramsay's house in South West London.

While Victoria was taking the children back to the UK for the Thanksgiving holiday, David is staying in Los Angeles to focus on his football match on Saturday.

Victoria decided to depart from her signature style for the flight, stepping out in an ensemble with a distinctly retro feel.

Leading the pack: The 13-year-old, who is growing up fast, was seen leading the way into LAX

Taking her style back in time: Victoria Beckham was seen arriving at LAX in a 70s inspired outfit, with her whole family in tow

Hot heels: The designer wore a unusual Junya Watanabe Comme des Garçons dress and a pair of Burgundy boots finished off her autumnal look

The
mother-of-four arrived at LAX with her whole brood wearing an unusual Junya Watanabe Comme des Garçons dress.

The fiery orange garment boasted monochrome patterned sleeves and a large check design on the skirt skirt.

What a sight: The six-strong brood are rarely seen all together given Victoria and David's hectic work schedules

Brood Beckham: Everyone looked well kitted out for their flight

Adding to her autumnal look, Victoria stepped out in a pair of burgundy boots and she had a dark berry manicure too.

While her outfit commanded attention, the Spice Girl hid her eyes from flashing cameras with a pair of oversized shades.

Little black riding hood: Victoria wrapped up Harper in a coat as she left the Ramsays house upon arrival in London

Full of beans: Romeo and Cruz looked full of energy after their long-haul flight from Los Angeles as they bounded down the Ramsays' steps

Autumnal look: Victoria was seen sporting a very different style to her usual look as she arrived at the airport 

Precious cargo: David Beckham was seen cuddling Harper as the family arrived at LAX on Wednesday night

Cute curls: Harper's hair is growing and she is sporting a curl in her locks

While Victoria had her arm around Romeo's neck in a tender fashion, David was seen cuddling the youngest member of the family.

Little Harper has already racked up her fair share of air miles despite being less than two-years-old.

The adorable tot appeared a little weary as she arrived at the airport in the arms of her father.

The whole Beckham brood: Harper and David were with their whole family and there was no chance of keeping a low profile with the six of them in the airport

Racking up the air miles: Although Harper isn't even two-years-old yet she has already a seasoned traveller

Sparkling shoes: Harper was seen with a pair of glittering pumps on her feet

Kiss for my cutie: David was seen leaning in to kiss his daughter

Given Victoria is a fashion designer,
Harper always looks extremely stylish for her age and her airport 
attire was no exception.

The little girl was wearing a knitted dress with dark tights and a cape-style coat by Burberry.

A cream hair clip matching her dress, was seen on the left side of her head in her hair.

Hands on dad: As well as carrying Harper David was seen holding onto the couple's youngest son Cruz, seven

Striding ahead: Brooklyn, 13, was seen walking ahead of his family and the teen is certainly growing up

Here come the boys: Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz all have very different styles

Harper wasn't the only one kitted out with designer clothes, Romeo was also wearing a jacket by the British luxury label.

While David took his brood to the airport for the flight to London, he was staying in Los Angeles ahead of a match on Saturday.

A spokesperson for the star said: 'Victoria is over with the kids for a few days. David is in LA focused on final.'

Photo opportunity: One woman seemed thrilled to have spotted the famous family at the airport and felt no shame whipping out her phone to capture the scene

Enjoying the excitement: Romeo looked pleased to be the centre of attention as the family arrived at the airport

Not so happy: David did not look impressed when one fan attempted to film his wife

Ready to roll: Romeo looked smart in his Burberry mac, dark jeans and shades around his neck, while Cruz opted for a much more casual look in white trainers and a bright orange beanie

David, 37, recently announced that he is set to leave LA Galaxy, after five years at the club.

The footballer has been bombarded with offers from China and Paris clubs after announcing his departure from LA Galaxy.

A source told MailOnline: 'David would like one last hurrah and there are tempting offers from China - and Paris Saint-Germain is back in the frame again. Brazil clubs have also been in contact.'

Peek-a-boo! Little Harper appeared to be playing hide and seek with her Burberry coat

Ready to move: The family are set to quit Los Angeles and are thought to be entertaining different locations to move to

Like father like son: Cruz was copying his father with a beanie in his headwear

Precious cargo: David was seen cuddling Harper tightly

If the star does take up a contract with a European club, the Beckhams will no doubt make their base in London, a move which will allow Victoria to work on her fashion line at her studios in Battersea.

The couple are not set to sell their $22 million mansion in Beverly Hills and will keep it on as their Californian base.

He's a natural: Romeo was seen beaming at the cameras, showing off a wide grin

Clashing prints: Victoria sported tartan, crushed velvet and a monochrome pattern with her travelling outfit

Where will they go to next? The family are rumoured to be moving to London after David announced he was quitting LA Galaxy

Look who it is: Even Harper is used to commanding attention wherever she goes

Making an impact: All six members of their family have their own style
