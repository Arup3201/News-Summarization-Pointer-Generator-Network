Irene Mullinger, 81, is now claiming unfair dismissal and age related discrimination

An 81-year-old checkout worker is suing DIY giant B&Q for unfair dismissal, claiming she was sacked for being too old.

Dedicated Irene Mullenger had worked at B&Q for almost a 25 years and had planned to continue in the role that she loved, saying that she is not ready to sit at home and 'vegetate'.

But the widow was left devastated after bosses at the company, which made £161m profit last year, forced her to leave after unfairly changing her shift pattern, she claims.

She is now claiming unfair dismissal 
and age related discrimination - making her one of the oldest employees 
in Britain ever to do so.

Mrs Mullenger claims bosses at the store in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, changed her 
shift patterns to hours and days she would not be able to work.

She was originally contracted to work 12 hours a week and for the past ten years had worked mornings only on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Friday.

But she claims she was asked to work every other weekend, perform early and late shifts and be available for work five days out of seven on a four week rota basis.

Mrs Mullenger claims this was indirect age discrimination because she is being asked to work hours most people her age would not usually be able to work.

She is also exempt from working Sundays 
as a 'protected shop worker' but the new shifts put to her stated she 
would have to work a minimum of every other weekend.

Because she has been employed by the 
same employer continuously since before 26 August 1994 she is a 
protected shop worker - which means she can opt out of working Sundays.

She alleges she was told that if she did not agree to the new terms of her working shifts she would be sacked.

Irene Mullenger had worked at B&Q for almost a quarter of a century and had planned to carry on for many more years in the job she loved

After failed negotiations with management, Mrs Mullenger was dismissed in August.

She contacted legal firm Regents Solicitors who issued the claim on October 30 giving B&Q 28 days to respond - they are yet to do so.

The claim form reads: ‘It was put to her that if she was not prepared to agree to these changes the Respondent would move to terminate her employment’.

Mrs Mullenger, of Great Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, said she was devastated at no longer having the job she believes has helped keep her going.

She said: 'I loved working there and I miss it badly. I’m worried I’ll vegetate if I sit at home doing nothing.

'It’s strange not working.

Bosses at the company, which made £161m profit last year, forced her to leave after unfairly changing her shift pattern, she claims

'I’ve worked all my life, for 64 years, and spent more than 30 years with the civil service before I joined B&Q.

'I wasn’t ready to be retired. I’m still fit and healthy and I had planned to carry on working for as long as I could.

'I always said I’d stop when I got too tired to carry on. But the fact is that I’m not tired yet.'

Lawyer Daniel Valentine, from Manchester, said: 'I think what the company did to Mrs Mullenger  was absolutely awful.

'She gave her all to B&Q for almost 25 years and she did not deserve to be treated in such a way.

'They are asking her to work hours people her age are usually unable to work.

'She feels they have unfairly changed her shift patterns and discriminating against her because of her age.

'The way she has been treated is utterly shocking.'

A spokesman for B&Q said: 'B&Q is proud of its track record on employing older people, almost 30 per cent of our 33,000 employees are over 50 years old and our oldest employee is 89 years old.

'We would never comment on an individual case and as this is an ongoing legal process it is not appropriate to comment further.'
