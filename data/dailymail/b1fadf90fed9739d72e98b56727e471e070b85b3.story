While America's Curiosity rover has excelled at sending back pictures of rocks on the Martian surface, Europe has not been left behind - as these stunning images of the Martian landscape show.

On 8 June, the high-resolution stereo camera on Mars Express captured a region within the 1800 km-wide and 5 km-deep Argyre basin, which was created by a gigantic impact in the planet’s early history.

It reveals the astonishing beauty of the red planet, with mountains frosted in carbon dioxide, and vast craters in an area researchers have dubbed the 'island of silver' due to the frost topped peaks.

The area covered by the new images

After Hellas, the Argyre impact basin is the second largest on the Red Planet.  

The name stems from the Greek word ‘argyros’ (silver) and Argyre was 
an ‘island of silver’ in Greek and Roman mythology.

Giovanni 
Schiaparelli, the famed Italian astronomer, gave the name to this bright
region on Mars in his detailed 1877 map.

At the centre of the larger impact basin is a flat region known as Argyre Planitia.

The
Mars Express images in this release all show a portion of the northern 
part of this area, with a large portion of each image dominated by the 
western half of the 138 km-wide Hooke Crater, named after the British 
physicist and astronomer Robert Hooke.

Most
of Argyre Planitia has been shaped by wind, glacial and lacustrine 
(lake-based) processes, creating the smoother appearance of the 
landscape surrounding Hooke Crater.

Inside Hooke Crater itself, 
researchers say prevailing wind activity has formed dunes and helped to create linear 
erosion, clearly seen in the images. 

The most striking feature of this image release, shown clearly in 
the first image at the top of the page, is the icing sugar-like covering
of the surface to the south (left) of the image. This is frost, but 
made of carbon dioxide, not water.

Carbon dioxide ice is commonly 
seen on the surface of Mars, and has long been thought to form only at 
ground level, freezing out of the atmosphere as frost, which is most 
likely the case here.

The lowlands to the south of Hooke and regions
within the crater are covered by a thin ice layer, the images show.

However, it is 
lacking on the inner north-facing crater wall.

ESA scientists believe it was probably melted 
there by the Sun, as indicated by the timing of the image.

Taken at 
around 4:30 in the local afternoon and during the southern hemisphere’s 
mid-winter, the Sun would have been just over 20 degrees above the 
horizon.

It should then have been able to melt ice on the steeper 
north-facing slopes, but would probably not have had enough time to warm
and melt any on low-lying horizontal surfaces.
