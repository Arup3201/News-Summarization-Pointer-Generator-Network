Most council bosses have defied government demands for pay restraint by handing out huge salaries while cutting services.

Around 61 per cent of councils paid their biggest earners more than the Prime Minister, who receives £142,500 a year.

The highest salary was thought to be the £318,500 paid by Somerset County Council – which is cutting jobs and services to save £18million – to Peter Lewis, director of children’s services.

Mr Lewis, who was on a temporary 
contract after being hired through an agency, was appointed following a 
highly-critical report by education watchdog Ofsted.

Somerset Council hit the headlines 
recently over the absence of chief executive Sheila Wheeler, who 
received a package worth £198,000, during the West Country floods which 
devastated large parts of the county.

Staff sparked anger by refusing
 to reveal her whereabouts after she had not been to work in her 
flood-stricken county for three months.

She later left her job for undisclosed reasons – but it was thought to be linked with a row with senior staff.

The huge payouts come at a time when the
 council is cutting jobs, youth and community services, and sheltered 
housing in an attempt to save £18million.

Since 2011, six out of ten councils have
raised its highest paid official’s salary - despite calls for 
belt-tightening as the economy begins to recover.

It will raise concerns
 that public sector bodies still ‘do not get’ the need to rein in 
profligate spending as Britain continues to drag itself out of 
recession.

Among the highest-paying 20 councils, only five reduced their top salary after ministers called for more austerity.

Dia Chakravarty, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘Sky-high public sector salaries are unacceptable and highlight the need for the war on waste.

‘Increasing the cost of a single role by £150,000 in a single year is astonishing, particularly when savings have to be made elsewhere.

‘Even if part of the money is going to agencies to find the right person, it still shows a lack of prudence.’

Other councils that bumped up their top salary included Wandsworth Council in south-west London from £174,271 to nearly £216,000 – more than £41,000 – and Birmingham by almost £13,000 to £212,000.

Labour-controlled Stoke-on-Trent City Council, meanwhile, approved a £5,000 salary increase for chief executive John van de Laarschot on the day it agreed to slash £21million from services.

The official who dressed as Superman to abseil down a building for charity, saw his pay increased to £195,516 – part of an overall package including perks and pension worth £232,000.

Dave Conway, leader of Stoke’s opposition City Independent group, said: ‘We’ve lost swimming pools, libraries and old people’s homes. I don’t know how the council can justify paying one man all this money at the same time.’

Stoke-on-Trent Council defended Van de Laarschot’s pay, saying the city needed someone with the ‘ability to effectively manage the delivery of complex services, and to drive jobs and growth for residents.’

John Osman, leader of Somerset County Council, said the high salaries were justified because Ofsted inspections had ‘highlighted that our child protection services were not good enough’.

The accounts of 137 of 226 local authorities in England were analysed.
