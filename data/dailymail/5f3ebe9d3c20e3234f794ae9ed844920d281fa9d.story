IT’S said that too many cooks spoil the broth. But when one of them is Cherie Blair, it might be a little difficult to tell her she is getting in the way.

The wife of the former Prime Minister lent a helping hand during a visit to a cramped food distribution centre in an Indian village.

Barefoot, with a bindi on her forehead and wearing a salwar kameez – traditional dress and leggings – she did her best to blend in. 

Involved: Cherie Blair joined workers in the rural village of Kuda in Gujarat, India, wearing traditional headdress

Fitting in: Mrs Blair's charity, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, supports the rural initiative

Sporting a large red bindi, Mrs Blair cleaned pulses and assisted the workers by filling and weighing bags of tumeric.

Mrs Blair was visiting India on behalf of her own charity, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, to promote rural trade in the country.

She met workers from the Rural Distribution Network India (RUDI) centre in Kuda village, Gujarat, India.

RUDI, which sells agricultural produce from local farmers, is aimed at enabling rural women earn a better living and thereby becoming more independent, and is supported by Mrs Blair's foundation.

Mrs Blair's legal work, alongside her husband's huge earnings for advisory work, consultancy and speeches, reportedly earning £20million a year, has left the family with a growing fortune.

The Blairs - along with their children - now seven properties with a combined value of £20million, having purchased a four-storey, £1.35million Georgian townhouse in central London, paid for with cash, earlier this year

Alongside her distinguished legal career, Mrs Blair is an avid philanthropist.

She wrote about the 
difficulties faced by women in the workplace last month, drawing on her 
own experiences in the male-dominated legal profession.

Writing in the Mail on Sunday, she 
said: 'Women often complain about  a lack of opportunities and not being
promoted – and there’s justice in many of those complaints – but we all
need to help those lower down the ladder too.'

Through her charity Mrs Blair said she is trying to promote workplace opportunities for women across the world.

Mrs Blair's charity has teamed up with the Vodafone Foundation to provide the rural Indian women with mobile phones and an app that allows them to communicate more effectively.

The scheme aims to help 2,000 female entrepreneurs in India over a three-year period.
