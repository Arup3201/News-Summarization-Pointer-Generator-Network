From the lavish invites and a plush location to a show-stopping dress and decadent cake, weddings don't come cheap.

But one cash-strapped bride-to-be is so desperate to tie the knot that she has resorted to selling advertising space - on her wedding dress.

Stacy Burnett, 29, and her partner Daniel Webb, 28, had their hearts set on getting married this year but can not afford their wedding even at a cut price.

Stacy Burnett and her partner Daniel Webb are looking for people to sponsor their wedding. Cash-strapped Stacey is so desperate to tie the knot she is selling advertising space on her dress

Smitten Stacy had bought her wedding dress in anticipation of booking their nuptials but rising costs meant they had to put their plans on hold.

But now, in a desperate bid to plow ahead with their big day, the couple are looking for sponsors.

Imaginative Stacy says she is even prepared for her dress and her fiance's bridal outfit to be covered in logos and adverts if it helps them bring in the funds they need.

The couple, who met two years ago, say they are happy to sit down and discuss ideas with the individual businesses about how they can advertise the services they provide them with on the day.

Mother-of-one Stacy, from Sittingbourne, Kent, said they didn't want anything 'big and fancy' but they hoped companies would back their idea.

She said: 'I started planning eagerly last year but due to the economic climate it's all had to be put on hold for the foreseeable future.

'My fiance works full time and we have even moved in with my parents so that we can save.

'We want a church wedding because it's a bit more traditional, but with church fees, venue fees, catering, rings, suits, DJ even for the most basic of weddings, it just wasn't possible for us to do it this year.

'We don't want a big fancy wedding but even the most basic of packages is too expensive.

'Doing everything on a budget we reckon it will still cost between £3,000 and £5,500.

'While some couples might not want to get married in 2013 because they're a little superstitious we'd love to get married this year - after all, we just want to say "I do".

'We would even be willing to have any advertising for any companies that would be kind enough to help us out.

'We'd be willing to talk about signs on my dress and the back of suits, all we'd ask is that they could be removed for photographs.'.

And Stacy isn't alone in offering herself up for sponsorship.

In japan some women are renting out their bare legs for companies to market their products in
return for payment.

With
the notion that a good advertisement should be put where everyone's 
eyes are drawn, an attractive woman's limbs seem like the perfect idea -
and sure enough, the clever marketing strategy is proving a huge hit 
with businesses all across Tokyo.

As of 
November 2012, about 1,300 girls have already registered their legs as ad
space with Absolute Territory PR, and the number keeps increasing.

Foreheads, forearms, hands and backs have all been covered in marketing messages and in Japan, about 1,300 girls have already registered their legs as ad space with Absolute Territory PR

Participating women get their 
legs stamped with an ad and go on with their usual life - albeit wearing
a short skirt or shorts and showing off their pins as much as possible.

As long as the ad is showing on their legs for eight hours a 
day or more, their job is done, and they are paid a part of the 
advertising fee.

And this isn't a completely new idea. The first 'skinvertisement' was sold in 2003 on the back of the head of an Illinois man named Jim Nelson.

CI Host paid Mr Nelson $7,000 for the ink and the promise that he would leave the logo for at least five years.

If you guessed that the tattoo outlasted the company, you'd be right.
