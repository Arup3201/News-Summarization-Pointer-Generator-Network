Comic Relief, which is hosted by Lenny Henry, pictured, has pledged to avoid investing in the so-called 'booze, bombs and fags' sector

Comic Relief has promised to stop putting money into controversial ‘booze, bombs and fags’ funds after it was shamed over its investment policies.

The charity published the results of an internal review by its trustees yesterday – six months after it was accused of making ‘unethical’ investments in alcohol, arms and tobacco companies.

It pledged to be ‘more transparent’ with its cash in future and blacklist all funds in those three areas.

But it stopped short of a wider ban on  other controversial investments deemed ‘unethical’ to ‘avoid an excessive reduction’ in the choice available.

Last year, Comic Relief faced a public  backlash after it was revealed it pumped  millions of pounds of donations from its  Red Nose Day campaign into alcohol, arms  and tobacco giants even as it backed projects to help victims of alcohol abuse, war and smoking-related illnesses.

The charity, chaired by BBC Worldwide boss Tim Davie, initially defended the policy on the grounds that ethical-only investments would generate a smaller return but it  eventually agreed to the review.

Comic Relief also said it would start selling its shares in tobacco, arms and alcohol companies while the review was carried out.

Yesterday, Mr Davie announced that its review panel had carried out ‘an excellent piece of work’ and all its recommendations had been accepted.

He added: ‘Public trust is the cornerstone of Comic Relief and we would be nothing without our many supporters to whom we have listened and will keep listening. We now have an investment policy that is firmly in line with the ethos of the charity, at the same time as making sure that the money we raise can go further to change lives both here in the UK and abroad.’

The Daily Mail exposed the scandal of Comic Relief's controversial investments in December 2013

The review panel headed by John Kingston, chairman of the Association of Charitable Foundations, said the charity should aim  for only a ‘small number of absolute prohibitions’ on its investment blacklist, which will be reviewed every six months.

Comic Relief said it would build stronger links between the investment committee and charity trustees to ensure they are ‘aligned’.

In 2013, Red Nose Day, which is held every two years, raised more than £100million after an eight-hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, hosted by presenters including Lenny Henry, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.

According to Comic Relief’s accounts from 2007 to 2009, it placed millions in ‘blue-chip’ City funds that invested in the controversial companies, including £2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009.

It is sitting on a £100million fund donated by the public despite promising in its  broadcasts to hand ‘every pound’ straight to good causes.
