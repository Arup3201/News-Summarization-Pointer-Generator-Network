A New York real estate broker is  seeking a buyer for her luxurious multi-million dollar home, which she currently shares with her husband, newborn baby - and her ex.

Carol E. Levy - known as 'The Billion Dollar Broker' - was forced to continue sharing the duplex at the Beresford on Central Park West with her ex-husband Chris Lipman after the couple divorced in 2012.

A judge ruled that Chris should receive spousal support, after he was let go from his wife's successful firm Carol E. Levy Real Estate when the couple split.

But this didn't stop the wealthy broker from moving on with her life, as Carol has since moved her new husband Joel Goron into the prestigious addresses, the New York Post reported.

'I have not allowed Chris' presence and the fact that he's not moved on with his life to stand in the way of moving full steam ahead with my life,' she told the newspaper.

'He is like a squatter here, and I am the ultimate doer. He is an unwanted guest, and once the apartment sells, it's all over.'

Chris currently lives rent-free on the 17th floor in the guest bedroom of the six-bedroom palatial apartment, surrounded by a media room and the kitchen.

Carol lives upstairs in the 18th-floor master suite with Joel, who she married in August, their new baby, and her  and Chris' two teenage daughters.

'I do not allow her ex's presence to affect our incredible happiness in any way whatsoever,' Joel said. 'He's merely a speed bump in the road.'

For his part, Chris says he chooses to remain living  in the unorthodox living situation - despite the frosty atmosphere - as it allows him to see his two daughters and eases financial pressures as he builds a separate business.

He also told the New York Post that his presence is also motivating Carol to sell the apartment, of which he will receive 45 per cent of the profits.

The legal ruling placed the burden of the mortgage and maintenance on Carol until the 5,000-square-foot marital home is sold.

The impressive property - which features city views, sweeping terraces, a grand staircase herringbone floors and two wood-burning fireplaces - came onto the market for $24 million and has already been reduced to $18 million to speed up the sale.

Carol describes the palatial apartment as 'a wonderful mix of classic pre-war with modern amenities', with a 'magical garden oasis' featuring panoramic views.

Divorce attorney Todd Spodek explained to the New York Post that many couples are left with no other option than to co-habit after a litigated divorce due to the current scarcity of real estate options in New York City.
