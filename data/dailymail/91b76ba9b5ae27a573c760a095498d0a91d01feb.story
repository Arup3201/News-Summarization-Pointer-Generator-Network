Rangers boss Ally McCoist stressed he had had no contact with Crystal Palace over their managerial vacancy after Saturday's 4-1 win against Dumbarton.

McCoist claimed he did not know where reports linking him with Selhurst Park had come from, and insisted he already had an important job on his hands.

'There has been no contact at all with Crystal Palace,' he said. 'As you can imagine, I have a serious amount of work to do here and anyone who knows me will appreciate it is important to see it through.

'The most immediate job is to get us out of this division. I'm desperate to do that as quickly as possible and my short and long-term job is to do that.

'It is flattering, and maybe Rangers' story coming through the divisions catches the attention, but I'm desperately keen to get the job here completed.'

Turning to his side's 4-1 win over Dumbarton, McCoist was more forthcoming.

First-half goals from Lee McCulloch and Darren McGregor set Rangers up for another home win on the back of Monday's 8-1 hammering of Clyde.

And although it was a gutsy performance from Dumbarton, a second-half strike from Nicky Clark and an own goal from Chris Turner left Ian Murray's team on the wrong end of another crushing defeat - with only a Bilel Mohsni own goal for consolation.

After making it two home wins in a week and scoring 12 goals in the process, the Rangers boss was delighted to keep the momentum going.

'I'm absolutely happy with the performance, although a little bit annoyed we didn't keep a clean sheet,' he said. 'We played good football and could have scored a few more - we hit the post twice.

'We are really pleased with the goals. If you are getting goals from throughout the team it is really pleasing - and losing the goal is really a bit of a moan.'

McCoist acknowledged there was a case for Mohsni to be sent off early in the second half for a trip on Scott Agnew on the edge of the box, but thought the referee got it right when he only showed a yellow card to the Rangers defender.

It was not a happy return to Ibrox for former Gers defender Murray as the Dumbarton boss watched his side slip to their third consecutive defeat.

While his side stood up well, Murray was disappointed with the way they leaked four goals.

'The goals are shockers, especially the first one from a set-play.' he said.

'I said to the players at half-time that it was only 2-0 and we could maybe have a chance with the next goal. But we lose another on the break and then when it goes to 4-0 you get a bit worried. Although we had a bit of luck with our goal, I thought we deserved something from the game.'

The Dumbarton manager did not want to dwell on the incident involving Mohsni and Agnew, but accepted it might have influenced proceedings.

'My initial reaction was that Agnew was through and Mohsni was the last man, but I don't want to see players sent off and maybe the ref has called it right,' he said.
