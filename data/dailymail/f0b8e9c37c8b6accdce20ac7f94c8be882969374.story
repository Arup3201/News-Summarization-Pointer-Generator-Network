She was married to Whitestripes rocker Jack White, was one of eight British models chosen to walk at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 
has a thriving music career in her own right.

And now unique British model Karen Elson is smouldering in this week's edition of Net-a-porter.

The 34-year-old talks to friend, stylist and shoe designer Tabitha Simmons about her love for fashion, music and being a mother.

Karen Elson and Tabitha Simmons met in Tokyo when Elson was just 16 and have remained friends ever since.

'We didn’t see each other for a year after Tokyo. Then I moved to New York and we bumped into each other at a restaurant. You would come over to my house and we would stay up late.

'Your shoe obsession was growing. You had those amazing Christian Dior boots. This was my fashion college, you know? Travelling the world, having you as a friend, we would go to the deli, and you would be decked out in Chanel!' Simmons recalls.

Elson adds: 'I didn’t have anything else to wear! I had done the Chanel campaign, and Karl [Lagerfeld] took me to the shop to get a ton of clothes.

'Those were the only nice clothes I had because I couldn’t afford anything.'

Born in the north of England, Elson has lived in Nashville since 2006.

Speaking about her childhood, she said: 'I left home at 16 and travelled and lived in so many different places, so when I had my daughter, Scarlett, at 26, and put my feet down in Nashville, it was a shock.'

Describing her life in Nashville, she said: 'They don’t sugar-coat it, and that’s what I like about it.

'If I went home and put on airs and graces, they would bat me down in a heartbeat. It is the same in Nashville. So I can be me here and not "Karen The Model."

Talented: Elson has gradually been building up her musical over the past few years and she is a founding member and performer with New York based political cabaret troupe The Citizens Band

'When I go to New York or Europe, I am working and I can enjoy it. But it’s not my 24/7 life.'

Discovered at the tender age of 16 by the owner of Boss models in Manchester, Elson's big break came when legendary Steven Meisel shot her for the cover of Italian Vogue on her 18th birthday.

She went on to work with most of the world's major fashion photographers and fashion designers, such as Bruce Weber, Mario Testino, Mert and Marcus, and Patrick Demarchelier.

Her roll call of campaigns includes Yves Saint Laurent, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Christian Dior, Burberry and Chanel, as well as starring on the cover of  Vogue, W, Dazed & Confused and Harper's Bazaar.

She was also the star of John Lewis' Autumn/Winter 2008/2009 campaign as well as H&M. The peak of her success came in 2005, when she won the British Fashion Award for Best Model.

When asked what the fashion world means to her now, she replied: 'It means so much to me, honestly.

'Being in fashion, knowing so many fascinating people has been such a big part of my life. From the outside, people tend to view fashion as a terrible thing, but it isn’t.

'Fashion has changed my life for the better. I love it. I’m interested in the whole process.'

Reflecting on her favourite fashion memory, she said: 'Shooting with Steven Meisel for the cover of Italian Vogue in 1997, it was on my 18th birthday, and they dyed my hair – it was the best birthday present ever!'.

Elson met Jack White when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for Blue Orchid, they married in 2005 and have a daughter and son together.

Sadly, the pair announced their divorce in June 2011.

On leaving the glamour behind and being at home with her young children, Elson said: 'I enjoy working as a model because I have this other life with my children, and it’s very real.

'I was up at 6.30am this morning making Henry and Scarlett’s lunches. It just puts you in your place instantly.'

Elson has gradually been building up her musical over the past few years and she is a founding member and performer with New York based political cabaret troupe The Citizens Band.

But how does she combine her fashion career with music?

'I’m both,' she said.

'How many musicians have their photograph taken? How many actors have a clothing line? It’s the world right now.

'In my opinion, if you are trying to do that and you are doing it for the right reason, why not. If you are your best, it is what it is.'

But the most important part of the multi-talented star's life is motherhood.

'The most important thing is being a mum. Oh, absolutely,' she said.

Stellar role: She walked in the Olympic closing ceremony alongside David Gandy, Georgia May Jagger, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss
