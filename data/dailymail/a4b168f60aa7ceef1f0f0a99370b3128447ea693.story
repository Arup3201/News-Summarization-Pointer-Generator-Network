Juan Mata has revealed Manchester United’s stars are still getting to grips with Louis van Gaal’s style of football.

Spanish playmaker Mata insisted that his team-mates are fully behind the manager as the club remain locked in a struggle for a Champions League place.

Some United fans are unconvinced by Van Gaal’s tactics and during their last Premier League match chanted ‘4-4-2’ after the Dutchman had again opted for his favoured 3-5-2.

The Dutch manager has switched between 3-5-2 and 4-4-2 formations this season

He switched to the more traditional format after the break and watched his side win 2-0 at Loftus Road.

But on Friday night in the FA Cup, in a 4-4-2 from the start, United could not find a way past League Two Cambridge and will now face a replay at Old Trafford after a disappointing 0-0 draw at the Abbey Stadium.

Speaking to the club’s website, Mata, who was rested for the FA Cup clash, is confident Van Gaal will get things right.

‘I think we are all learning from the manager,’ he said. ‘He is a great character and a great coach. The way he wants to play football is the right way, which is an attacking way.

The Spain international insists that Van Gaal's football philosophy will eventually bring rewards

‘That means we try to work hard with the ball, try to create space to pass the ball quickly and to switch it from side to side. I really like the way he sees football and we are all trying to do our best for him, the staff and for Ryan [Giggs].’

Mata joined from Chelsea a year ago for a then club record £37.1m.

And he says that the size of United continues to amaze him.

‘The pre-season tour made me realise how big the club is,’ he said. ‘Once we were on the tour and travelling around, we saw how many supporters we had against teams like Real Madrid and Inter Milan. We had more fans than anyone in the States. I expect places like Asia and Australia are the same – it’s unbelievable the support we get around the world.’

Looking back over his 12 months, Mata was asked for his favourite match and goal.

‘I always remember my first game against Cardiff,’ he said. ‘We’ve had some good games, such as Newcastle away (last season) and Liverpool at home this season. There have been some good games personally and for the team.

‘I liked the two free-kicks I scored at Newcastle and Southampton last season. They were good goals.’
