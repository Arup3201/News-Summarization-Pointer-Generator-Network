The owner of a 'filthy' takeaway has been fined £2,250 after health inspectors found staff had to plunge their hands into the cistern to flush the toilet before returning to make pizzas.

Food hygeine officers also said there was no hot water for those preparing food at Flying Pizza in Swansea, South Wales.

The rest of the shop in the Morriston area of the city was caked in dirt and grease, Swansea Magistrates' Court heard, but its owner said today: 'My customers are very happy'.

Horrifying: The owners of Flying Pizza in Swansea have been fined heavily because hygiene standards were so poor

Busted: Staff at the takeaway had to plunge their hands into the cistern to flush it, and there was no hot water to wash their hands afterwards

Grim: The Flying Pizza was caked in dirt and grease, like on this piece of equipment

Grimy: These frozen foods were found opened or covered in dirt, but owners maintain their customers are happy

Prosecutor Sarah Thyer said: 'The takeaway was in a filthy condition.

'They found the only toilet in the premises couldn't be flushed and staff had to put their hands in the cistern to flush it.

'The boiler was broken and no hot water was available for staff to then washing their hands.

'There was food debris, grease and dirt running down the wall under the dirty sink and dirty cookers and shelves.'

Magistrates heard how the owner of the takeaway at Morriston, Swansea, had since installed a new boiler and completed a food hygiene qualification.

Old: This industrial mixer had not cleaned for some time before health inspectors came in

Questions: The court heard how detritus and gunge was spread all over the takeaway where staff couldn't properly clean their hands

Dirty: This chest freezer's seal was photographed by hygiene experts brought in to check its standards

Restaurateur Abbas Salimi admitted nine breaches of food hygiene rules. 
He was fined a total of £2,250 and told to pay £2,000 costs.

He said: 'I have bought all new kitchen equipment and I have good new staff.

'I am working closely with Environmental Health and have a level three certificate, in March Health and Safety visited and they were very happy.

'My customers are very happy.'
