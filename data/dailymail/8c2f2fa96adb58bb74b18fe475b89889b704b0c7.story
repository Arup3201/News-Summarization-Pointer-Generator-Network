A tape which was allegedly the final recording of Joan Rivers is a fake, the late comedian's representative said today.

An audio recording, which was revealed by The New York Post on Tuesday, was purportedly Ms Rivers in a promo clip for a friend's new, off-Broadway show.

The late star's rep, Judy Katz, told The Post today: 'The recording is a fraud. Joan never made any such tape.

'This is a publicity stunt that was created by Brad Zimmerman and his public relations representative, Beck Lee, and is wholly disrespectful to the memory of Joan Rivers.'

The alleged 'final recording' of Joan Rivers is a fraud, her rep said on Tuesday, and was an insult to her memory

In a statement to MailOnline today, Beck Lee said: 'On behalf of the production of My Son the Waiter we regret that the tape we were given is not authentic. We believed that it was, especially because we knew that it was Joan's wish to take care of Brad.

'Speaking of Brad, he had nothing to do with this situation. Offending Joan or her memory is the last thing he would do. 

If offense is taken by an inauthentic recording being distributed, by either Joan's family colleagues or fans, we regret this.

'We accepted the recording from its source purely because we believed Joan's wish to support Brad was being honored by its creation and distribution.'

Lee had no comment on the identity of the provider of the tape.

Ms Katz said that Ms Rivers had agreed to record a promo for her friend later on the same day that she had the treatment - but it never happened.

n the clip, a voice, promoted as Rivers, complained about a problem with her voice.

'My voice has been bothering me,' the voice said on tape. 'I don't know what it is.'

Ms Rivers attended a Manhattan clinic for an elective procedure on her vocal cords on August 28 where she went into cardiac arrest and went into a coma. She never woke up and passed away on September 4 at the age of 81. 

The audio tape was believed to have been recorded by Ms Rivers for her friend, Brad Zimmerman.

The Post reported that she had volunteered to make a radio ad for his off-Broadway show, My Son the Waiter, a Jewish Tragedy.

Melissa Rivers and her son Cooper attend her beloved mother's funeral in New York City on September 7. The comedienne passed away after slipping into a coma following a minor procedure at a Manhattan clinic

'Joan used Brad as an opening act many times, and when we asked her if she'd do the spot, she said ''sure'' immediately,' an unnamed representative told the Post this week.

At the start of the clip, coughing can be heard.

'I told [you] I didn't feel good,' a voice said. 'My voice has been bothering me. I don't know what it is...I feel like s***. I'm tired already.'

The tape then goes into a typically acerbic Rivers' performance, with zingers riffing on Zimmerman's decades as a waiter.

'Hi, I'm Joan Rivers, can we talk?' the voice on the recording said. 'About.. Brad Zimmerman... he waited on tables for 29 years - stupid, or what - before he got up the nerve to write a hilarious show. Stupid! He's dumber than Heidi Abromowitz!'

Heidi was an fictional character created by Ms Rivers who she referred to as 'tramp of the century'.

'This is terrible copy. Who wrote this crap?' the voice continued. 'I feel sick... Anyway, the critics are calling it hilarious, a total must-see, and I love him, too. So don't wait 29 years to see my friend.'

The recording then says that they will need to record a second take.

'My voice is bothering me... I can't... I have to do it again,' the voice added.

'Coming to the Triad Theater, starting October 10 through New Year's,' the voice starts up again. 'I have better things to do on New Year's than this s***!'

After one last plug for the show she signs off for good.
