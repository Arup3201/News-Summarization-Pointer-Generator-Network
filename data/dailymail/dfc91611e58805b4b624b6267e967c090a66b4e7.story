Temperatures in the Northeast soared into the upper 90s for a
second day as residents fled to pools and beaches, tourists reorganised
their sightseeing itineraries and street vendors and store owners made a
small fortune selling bottled water and other cold drinks.

New York’s Central Park was forecast to reach a record 98 
degrees but fell just short of a record at 94 degrees and Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C all experienced similar 
heat.

Records fell at Logan Airport in Boston as it hit a record high of 96 degrees today, surpassing the 63-year-old record of 95 degrees.

According to the National Weather Service, temperatures at the East Boston airport reached record levels just after 3 p.m. Thursday. The previous high record temperature of 95 degrees was set in 1949.

Temperatures also reached the mid-90s in other areas, including 96 in Westfield and 95 in Springfield.

New York's Central Park fell four degrees short of the record for 21 June after the temperature peaked at 94 degrees around 1 p.m. and by 3 p.m. had fallen to 93.

'We may not get all the way up to 98, but it’s still a hot day out 
there,' said Brian Biemnecki, a meteorologist with the Weather Service to the New York Times.

Feeling the heat in Times Square was Bashir Saleh, a food vendor.

'I’m exhausted,' said Saleh, a native of Afghanistan who’d been working
already eight hours as the heat rose near his propane-gas fueled coffee
maker.

But the heat is worth it, he said, noting he makes more money selling iced coffee and other drinks on hot days.

In Boston, even as temperatures soared into the 90s, many took the heat in stride.

At
the city’s Franklin Park Zoo, gorillas sucked on ice treats and 
ostriches waded through spray mists in an effort to keep cool.

Spokeswoman Brooke Wardrop said the 100-year-old zoo routinely takes weather precautions with its animals.

In
New Jersey, forecasters say temperatures could combine with humidity to
make it feel like 110 degrees in parts of the state. Thermometers might
not drop below 80 until the wee hours of Friday morning.

'American Idol' hopefuls in Newark got a bit of a break from the heat 
Thursday morning when they were ushered inside the Prudential Center to 
register to audition.

In preparation for the sweltering weather, 
golf course officials at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut had 
IVs ready to go at a medical tent where dozens were treated for heat 
exhaustion Wednesday.

Emergency medical services director John Quinlavin said people need 
to drink more water at the stations set up around the course. Forecasts 
for the area call for temperatures just short of 100 degrees.

'People
are coming in dizzy, a little nausea, vomiting, generally poor feeling 
overall,' he said. 'We generally have a more mature audience here, and 
we do see a lot of the elderly having some problems with the heat.'

Across
the northeast, public health officials warned residents to not leave 
pets or children in vehicles as temperatures can quickly escalate and 
lead to heat stroke and death.

Two dogs left in a hot pickup truck in western Massachusetts died as a result of the heat Wednesday afternoon.

Erika
Mueller, a co-owner of South Deerfield Emergency Veterinary Hospital, 
said the well-meaning dog owner left the animals in the truck with a 
window open and a supply of water, but the temperatures can surpass 100 
in a vehicle.

Weather map for Thursday 21 June showing the forecast for record temperatures

A forecast for Friday shows a nationwide heatwave, as the East Coast can look forward to a slight dip following the highs of Thursday

While the northeast drops into the comparatively comfortable 80s, the rest of the U.S. continues to experience scorching temperatures

On Wednesday, at least 66 weather stations across 
the nation broke or tied high temperature records, according to the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But, 
NOAA forecaster Dave Unger said the east coast will soon get a relief 
from the extreme heat as a low pressure system and possible coastal 
storms are expected to lower temperatures heading into the weekend.

He
said extreme temperatures are likely this summer, with the 
administration's forecast through September calling for hotter than 
normal temperatures for every continental state, except for New England.
