A gunman who injured three tourists when he fired live ammunition instead of blanks during a mock Wild West shoot-out show was a convicted criminal, it has emerged.

Paul Doering, 49, is now facing a federal weapons charge because he should not have been carrying a gun.

The tourists were hit during the June 17 re-enactment staged by the Dakota Wild Bunch, who usually use blanks when performing several times a week on a street in Hill City, a tourist town in South Dakota's Black Hills.

The show has now been suspended.

The bullets shattered a leg bone of Carrol Knutson, 65, of Birchwood, Minnesota; hit the forearm and elbow of John Ellis, 48, an optometrist from South Connellsville, Pennsylvania; and caused minor injuries to Jose Pruneda, 53, of Alliance, Nebraska.

Doering, of Summerset, is now facing a federal weapons charge because of his previous criminal record.

He today appeared in a federal court in Fargo, North Dakota, but did not enter a plea. He will re-appear in a federal court in Rapid City on August 11 for arraignment.

Chief deputy state attorney Lara Roetzel said her office would not be filing state charges against Doering.

Horror: Blood from one of the victims pools in the street where the shootout happened

Investigators will not say why the incident happened, but Hill City Administrator Brett McMacken said it appeared to have been accidental.

The mock shootouts between lawmen and outlaws, sponsored by the Hill City Chamber of Commerce, have been held in the town in front of crowds of around 160 people for at least 20 years.

The Dakota Wild Bunch has been doing the show, which has since been suspended, for four years.

Investigators earlier this month found Doering had served more than five years in Minnesota prisons on multiple felony convictions.

Scene: The event took place on the corner of Main St and Elm St, in Hill City, South Dakota

But South Dakota law prohibits convicted criminals from possessing or having control of a firearm for 15 years.

He served 14 months for two first-degree assault convictions in the early 1980s, according to John Schadl of the Minnesota Department of Corrections.

He returned to prison in 1990 after he was convicted of second-degree burglary. While serving a 14-month sentence, he was charged with escape and ordered to serve additional time.

Aftermath: Pennington County deputies question a member of the shootout

Doering then went back to prison in 2000 and late 2001 after he was convicted of fleeing from law enforcement.

His lengthy criminal history includes numerous arrests for traffic violations and at least one conviction for driving with more than the legal limit of alcohol in his system.

Court records also show that Doering pleaded guilty to violating a protection order in 2004.

He was placed on probation and was only released from probation in April 2010. He still owes the Hennepin County Clerk of Courts $158 for the cost of his prosecution.

Victim: Carrol Knutson, 65, from Birchwood, Minnesota was one of three people shot in a Wild West-style shootout in South Dakota

Mr McMacken said he did not know whether background checks were carried out on the re-enactors.

George Heywood Jr, of Hill City, was once a part of the shootout re-enactments, and said many residents were not fans.

He said: 'Certain people in Hill City have never cared for it. At one time, it was really neat.'

Heywood said local support for the shootout has declined as new people joined the business district, and there was much more control over the shootout when local businessmen were actively involved in the performances.

He added: 'I think they had a lot more into it, so safety meant more than when you have someone hired or brought in that no one really knows.'

When asked about Doering's criminal record, he said: 'I think that’s a big mistake by somebody. Whoever’s in charge of that group, that’s definitely a big mistake.'
