Accused: Midwife Valerie El Halta has been accused of negligent homicide for the death of a baby

An unlicensed midwife who was sued for a baby's death in Michigan has now been charged with negligent homicide in a second newborn's death after moving to Utah.

Valerie El Halta, 71, oversaw a home birth in Moab on August 17 but the baby suffered oxygen deprivation and his mother nearly bled to death after the midwife allegedly administered prescription drugs and procedures - such as a 'vacuum' to pull out the baby - that she was not licensed to carry out.

Utah allows lay, unlicensed midwives to practice legally, as long as they are assisting in a low-risk natural birth.

This is not El Halta's first brush with the law. Another family sued her for the death of their child in 1993 and other mothers have claimed she was forceful and carried out painful procedures - with one branding the aggressive, involuntary treatment 'rape', the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

She began practicing in California in 
the 1970s and carried out home births for seven years there - although 
lay midwifery is illegal in the state.

In
1983, she was charged in Manteca with two felony counts of practicing 
medicine without a license and a charge of illegally possessing a 
hypodermic syringe, according to The Modesto Bee.

She pleaded guilty but told reporters 
that she planned to move to Oregon, where she was allowed to practice 
legally. Oregon has since passed restrictions for unlicensed midwives.

She worked in the state and then trained interns in Texas before opening a center in Michigan.

Scene: The newborn died at Primary Children's 
Medical Center in Salt Lake City in August after El Halta allegedly 
carried out procedures and administered drugs she was not licensed to use

But
in 1993, her center was smacked with a lawsuit after patient Rebecca 
Malloy, from Macomb, lost one of her twins, accusing the midwife of 
failing to call 911 quick enough.

The
baby, Lia Joy, was taken away by staff just hours after her birth - and
three weeks later she died. Doctors told her they did not know if Lia 
would have survived if she'd been born in hospital.

'Valerie wasted, like, a whole hour,' Malloy told the Tribune. 'She played 
god. She had this ego: She was the guru of birth. Valerie knew there was
a problem, and she withheld the information from us.'

Malloy
sued El Halta and said she received a $1 million default judgment, but 
attorneys said El Halta was 'uncollectable,' as non-nurse midwives are
not required to carry malpractice insurance.

Another patient, Kya Rose from 
Lancing, Michigan, sought El Halta's help with her birth in 1996 but 
endured a painful experience, she told the Tribune. The most horrifying part came when the midwife used a 'vacuum' to pull out her child.

'It was the single most painful thing Val
did during my birth,' Rose said. 'She had both of her hands inside me. I
was yelling at her to get them out, but she refused because she was 
helping. If someone has two hands in you, and you're telling them no, 
and they don't stop - that's why I call it a rape.'

El Halta had become a Certified 
Professional Midwife in 1996 - but was stripped of her certification in 
2001 when a panel found she had strayed outside her 'scope of practice'.

She then moved to Utah and continued practicing as an unlicensed midwife.

carried out painful procedures and ignored their pained cries (file

In the most recent case in Utah, she participated in the birth after meeting with the mother - who has not been named - four times.

The mother was a high-risk pregnancy as 
she had previously had three C-sections - but El Halta allegedly told 
her that she had substantial experience performing vaginal births with 
women who had undergone such procedures. She is not legally allowed to carry out high-risk births.

Valerie El Halta has overseen thousands of births across the country and finally settled in Utah, where it is not illegal for her to carry out midwife services without a license.

The Salt Lake Tribune noted that Utah allows three types of midwives:

Nurse Midwives who have the equivalent of a master's degree and work alongside doctors

Certified 
Professional Midwife - a title given out by the North American Registry 
of Midwives, which is the status of home birth midwives in the state. They can use some prescription drugs but may only take low-risk clients

There are also unlicensed, lay midwives in the state. They are not regulated by any professional body but they are allowed to conduct home births that are low risk and natural

Utah code requires them to limit 
their practice 'to a normal pregnancy that is low risk at the start of 
labor and remains low risk throughout the course of labor and delivery' - a code which the lawsuit claims El Halta broke.

Oregon also shared the same attitude towards voluntary licensing until this summer, when it passed restrictions. Thirteen
other states, from Nevada to Maine, neither license nor forbid non-nurse midwives and in 10 
states, non-nurse midwives may not practice legally, the Tribune noted.

On August 17, she reportedly administered a prescription drug to the 41-year-old mother, claiming it was from her pharmacist son, yet she was not licensed to do so.

The drug, Cytotec, has been known to cause uterine rupture or other complications when administered to pregnant women, court documents noted. The mother received three more doses.

El Halta allegedly tried to speed up the birth and gave the mother a painful examination. At one point, she checked the baby's pulse and it slowed down before becoming normal again.

The mother began to vomit and have diarrhea, and after about an hour, the baby's heartbeat could no longer be heard.

The midwife 'panicked and 
grabbed a ... "vacuum", attached it to the newborn's head and pulled the
newborn from the mother with one pull', court documents state.

The baby came out with its umbilical cord wrapped around its body, which was blue. He was not breathing and El Halta performed CPR on the
baby as 911 was called.

The mother hemorrhaged four cups of blood, and El Halta tried to 
suture her, which she was not licensed to do, court documents allege.

The mother was taken to Moab Regional 
Hospital where doctors learned that the vacuum had caused 'profound trauma' to the mother's 
vaginal area that would have soon led to her death.

She received blood and plasma and was flown to a hospital in Grand 
Junction, Colorado, where she received transfusions that saved her life. But her newborn died a week later at hospital from oxygen 
deprivation.

El Halta has been charged with 
unlawful conduct, which carries a penalty of up to 
five years in prison, and with negligent homicide and 
reckless endangerment, which each carry one year.

El Halta, from Eagle Mountain, told the Daily Herald that she was very upset by the allegations, adding that 'most of it is untrue'.

In a previous interview with a Michigan newspaper, El Halta said that she was made for midwifery.

'They'll have to cut off my hands to stop me,' she said.
