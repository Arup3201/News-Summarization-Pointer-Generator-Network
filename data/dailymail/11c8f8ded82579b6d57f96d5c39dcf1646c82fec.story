Real Madrid have tied up a deal to sign Levante goalkeeper Keylor Navas following his outstanding World Cup campaign with Costa Rica.

The 27-year-old helped Costa Rica progress from a tricky group including England, Italy and Uruguay but was unable to stop his country from falling to a penalty shootout defeat against Holland in the quarter-finals.

Number one: Navas was first choice for Costa Rica but will he be at Real Madrid?

However Navas will be in dreamland as his fine performances in Brazil have alerted the attention of Real Madrid who have subsequently met Navas' €10million release clause.

His transfer to the Bernabeu comes just days after Levante president Manuel Quico Catalan said there was 'nothing in it' when he was asked about speculation linking Navas with a move to Real Madrid.

Navas, who held talks with Bayern Munich before agreeing a deal to join Real Madrid, will compete with Diego Lopez and Iker Casillas for a first-team spot at last season's Champions League winners.

Lopez and Casillas are both expected to stay at Real despite Navas' arrival.
