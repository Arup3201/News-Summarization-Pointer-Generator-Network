A shooting involving motorcycle club members outside a Central Florida veterans' centre has ended with two dead and a third critically wounded.

Police in Winter Springs say a charity motorcycle ride was about to depart from the Veterans of Foreign Wars post on Sunday morning when the shooting broke out as the riders were eating breakfast.

A number of armed men arrived and started firing, according to witnesses at the scene who reported hearing up to 50 shots fired.

Shooting: A line of men are seen detained where police in Central Florida say two people were shot dead and another in critical condition Sunday morning

Members: One of the men seen detained by officers was wearing a Warlocks Motorcycle Club logo, one pictured, on his back

'Earlier we had noticed two motorcycle gangs, I believe had the altercation,' an unidentified witness responding from the neighbourhood told WFTV.

'I don't believe it was the normal clientele of the VFW,' he added.

It's unclear if any of the attendees shot back or how many shooters were involved.

None of the victims have been identified.

Local news captured a line of men handcuffed at the scene, with Winter Springs Police spokesman Lt. Doug Steeley saying the agency has detained several people and confiscated a number of weapons.

He believes all three victims were motorcycle club members.

Among those seen cuffed was a man wearing a Warlocks Motorcycle club logo across his back.

Scene: Witnesses say the shooting began after a biker gang pulled up to a second having breakfast at the Florida Veterans of Foreign Wars post, pictured

Crime scene: Police say everyone potentially involved was detained at the scene of the crime while they work to determine how many shooters were involved

Notorious in the area, the Warlocks are a biker clan originating in Orlando
with several other chapters throughout the U.S., Britain and Germany 
according to their website.

'As far as shooters on the loose, everybody that was on scene when we got here has been contained,' Lt. Seely told News13.

VFW posts around the country care for veterans and their families.

It wasn't immediately clear if the bikers had rented out the post or were members.

A senior centre next door was evacuated with the surrounding neighbourhood taped off.
