Living on one of England’s finest aristocratic estates, the  villagers of Beeley have for generations been subservient to their wealthy landowner.

But rebellion is stirring among residents on the historic acres of Chatsworth.

A dispute over three cottages has triggered a feudal-style row between the Duke of Devonshire and residents of the ‘tied’ village.

Opponent: Siobhan Spencer outside 1, 2 and 3 Dove Cottages in Beeley, which are at the centre of a row over plans by the Chatsworth Estate to turn the Grade II-listed homes into holiday rentals

'All consuming': The conversions would bring the total proportion of holiday rentals in the hamlet (above) to 25 per cent in move critics say places too much emphasis on tourism

History: The Grade II-listed Dove Cottages are at the centre of the dispute

They fear the scale of tourism connected to Chatsworth House stately home is damaging the community, and the plan to turn the old stone buildings into more hotel rooms is a step too far.

Beeley’s residents have formed a heritage group to protect the character of their village and a petition with 61 signatures has been presented to national park planners, who are due to decide on the application in two days’ time.

Objectors are worried about the dwindling number of affordable starter homes for people in the Peak District National Park community.

If the hotel extension is granted, one in four homes would be ‘holiday lets’ and have a ‘detrimental impact on village life’, they say.

Although planning consent is recommended by officers, the decision is said to be in the balance due to the strength of local feeling.

Feudal row: The Duke of Devonshire (above) owns the vast Chatsworth Estate, which includes the hamlet of Beeley

Until they became vacant, the Grade II listed Dove Cottages – situated opposite the Devonshire Arms Hotel in the heart of Beeley – had been homes to generations of estate workers since the mid-1800s.

The hotel is one of a chain of upmarket ‘Devonshire’ hotels belonging to the Duke and Duchess and the change of use consent would give it six extra valuable en suite bedrooms.

Beeley nestles on the banks of the River Derwent in Derbyshire, one-and-a-half miles from the aristocratic home. It has 86 homes and a population of 200.

Siobhan Spencer has lived there for 30 years and her husband has worked for the Duke for decades.

They have a ‘tied house for life’, but she is concerned that this is an unlikely prospect for people brought up there now.

It is ‘virtually impossible for many young people to get on the property ladder’ as they compete with outsiders and tourism, she said. Many families are forced to move away.

She added: ‘These cottages are right in the heart of the community and allowing them to be turned into hotel rooms threatens to kill that.

‘Beeley is not a very big place and it feels like the tourism aspect of Chatsworth is going to become all-consuming.’

Not so tranquil: The Chatsworth Estate, upon which Chatsworth House (above) lies, has defended itself by saying it also owns 15 other houses in the village which are occupied by estate staff and pensioners

In papers presented to the planning committee, Chatsworth stated it owns none of the 11 other holiday cottages.

Of 31 houses owned by the estate, 15 are occupied by staff and pensioners and 12 let on residential tenancies. It argues this demonstrates commitment to affordable housing.

Yesterday, Nick Wood, land agent for Chatsworth, said: ‘The village has more affordable housing than many ... and we do provide other affordable housing in other villages.

‘But we can’t do that without running a business. It is a balance and we don’t think we have stepped over the line.’

Beeley was bought in 1747 by the third Duke of Devonshire.
