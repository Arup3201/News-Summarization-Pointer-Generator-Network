A blundering crook made the worst decision of his criminal career when he decided to pull a knife on Florida's top policeman.

Larry Jackson, 56, thought Timothy Liberatore would be an easy victim after spotting him walking near the Marion County courthouse in Ocala.

He approached his target with one hand wrapped up in a towel, which he flicked off to reveal a folding knife with a 5" blade.

However he hadn't reckoned with the fact that Mr Liberatore was not only a Sheriff's Corporal but had just last week been named the Florida Sheriffs Association's law enforcement officer of the year.

Cpl. Liberatore just pulled out his handgun, pointed it at Jackson and after identifying himself ordered him to drop the knife, before calling for help.

Jackson was soon sitting handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser and was later charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

State records show he has been in and out of prison for the past 10 years for offenses including burglary, grand theft and petty theft.

He was last released from a Florida prison in June 2012, Ocala.com reports.

Meanwhile Cpl Liberatore has served with the sheriffs office for 10 years working as a patrol deputy, a drug agent and is currently assigned to the Tactical Investigations Unit in the Crime Suppression Division.

Last year alone he made a staggering 260 arrests which resulted in 115 felony and 167 misdemeanor charges, according to the Sheriff's Office.

In addition to the rank of corporal, he also is considered to be a master deputy.
