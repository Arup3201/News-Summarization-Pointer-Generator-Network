Germany are in crisis. Just three months after winning the World Cup in Brazil, Joachim Low’s team are already floundering in their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

With  one win and one draw from their opening three games, the team have recorded the worst start to a qualifying campaign ever from a German or West German side. Even the scrappy victory against Scotland was hardly anything to cheer about, while defeat to Poland and a shock to draw to the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday evening have firmly knocked the wind out of German sails.

The German media are already restless. Tagesspiegel joked that Gibraltar, one of Germany’s next opponents, would be planning for victory. Bild, meanwhile, were asking: 'how bad is the atmosphere among our World Cup winners?'.

John O'Shea equalises for Ireland in the fourth minute of injury time in their qualifier against Germany 

The 1-1 draw means Germany have tasted victory in only one of their opening three Euro 2016 qualifiers 

The answer was visible on the pitch after John O’Shea’s equaliser on Tuesday. The Germans walked off without a word to one another, no trace of the team spirit which earned them so much praise last summer. There were, however, no excuses.

'We can only blame ourselves,' said Jerome Boateng. 'When you lose the ball so easily at the end of a game, then late goals can happen.'

Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was visibly upset. 'It’s incredibly irritating,' he said. 'We pretty much hadthe three points in the bag.'

In truth, both against Poland and Ireland, Germany dominated the play, but were incapable of adding the finishing touch. Even with injuries to key players such as Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil this is a team which can boast the attacking qualities of Andre Schurrle, Mario Gotze, Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos. They should be beating Ireland, and they know it.

Lukas Podolski, Erik Durm and Thomas Muller reflect on a disappointing night for the world champions

There are a whole host of reasons for these post-World Cup problems. The first, and most significant, is both mental and physical fatigue. They've lacked imagination and concentration in recent games, too. Dominating by default, they have expected the goals to come naturally, and they have been disappointed.

The squad is also going through a minor upheaval. Sebastian Rudy, Karim Bellarabi and Chelsea target Antonio Rudiger have impressed in their first games for the national team. They will establish themselves fully over time, but they are yet to be part of what was rightly recognised as a very tight-knit unit of footballers. 

Even some of the members of the World Cup squad, such as Matthias Ginter, Erik Durm and Julian Draxler, also have very little international playing time under their belts.

And then there is Philipp Lahm. It may sound like an easy excuse, but the loss of Germany’s captain is one problem which Low has so far been unable to solve. 

Pep Guardiola describes Lahm as the player in world football with the highest levels of concentration, and it is that kind of influence which Germany have been lacking in recent games. 

It is not just about leadership and experience, but also about Lahm’s on field intelligence – his ability to see and pick the gaps in opposing teams.

Joachim Low cut a frustrated figure on the touchline as Germany drew with the Ireland on Tuesday

German fans still beleive Low is the man for the job despite the difficult start to the qualifying campaign 

It does not help that new captain  Schweinsteiger is also out injured. Nonetheless, there were nine World Cup winners on the pitch against both Poland and Ireland, so it is a fair question which Welt newspaper posed, when they asked 'where are the leaders?'

The question mark sums up the general reaction in Germany so far. Confusion reigns, rather than anger. Even the German fans, who are usually quite happy to boo an underachieving national team, were quieter than expected on Tuesday. They were too shocked, too confused.

Low won over a lot of critics with his World Cup win. For the moment, Germany trusts that he is perfectly capable of turning the situation around, and building a reformed team to become European Champions in 2016. Any more results like those against Poland and Ireland, however, and the knives may be drawn again.
