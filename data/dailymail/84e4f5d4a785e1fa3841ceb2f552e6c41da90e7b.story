Film streaming website Netflix has been criticised after some of its movies appeared to have been secretly cropped  - with viewers often not seeing half of the original scenes.

Popular films such as Planet of the Apes, Prometheus and Inglourious Basterds have all been affected - with entire characters often missing in the Netflix versions.

Film fans have been left particularly angered because they say the popular streaming service does not inform them that films have been altered.

Controversial: Film streaming website Netflix has been accused of secretly cropping its movies which often results in viewers missing up to half of the original image. This is a scene from the original Man on the Moon starring Jim Carrey, left

Cut: But in this Netflix version, Jim Carrey's character is completely missing from this scene

Worrying: Classics such as Planet of the Apes are also affected. This is a scene from the original version of the 1968 film

Cropped: But as this image shows, in the Netflix version the entire table of three people is completely missing

However, the firm this afternoon said it was not cropping films but occasionally offered the wrong version of a title.

Netflix said when it discovers errors, it works to replace the title as soon as possible.

As reported by Gizmodo, a Tumblr page, called What Netflix Does, highlights the extent of the problem.

In a scene from the 1968 classic Planet of the Apes, half of the original version is cut from the Netflix film, resulting in viewers not seeing a table of three characters.

In the 1999 film Man on the Moon, the lead character Jim Carrey is cropped out entirely from a scene in the Netflix film.

A scene from the original version of Quentin Tarantino's hit Inglourious Basterds features a table of five people. But in the Netflix version, it is heavily cropped, with just two characters featuring prominently.

Popular: Quentin Tarantino's hit Inglourious Basterds also does not appear to escape the attention of the croppers

Different: Despite the original scene showing a table of five people, the Netflix version centres in on just two characters

Classic: This is the original version of the 1984 film Dune

Missing: But as this image shows, the version which Netflix subscribers see misses out two characters

Film critics claimed the cropping occurs because Netflix prefers to show wider-screen films.

But in order to make these films fit the viewer's screens, they accused the firm of cropping out sections of the original.

But film fans and critics have been left angered because they are not told about it.

Many older films which have been modified in the past feature this disclaimer before the start of a movie.

'This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.'

Flavorwire's film critic Jason Bailey had been left furious by the apparent cropping: 'The framing choices made by a director and cinematographer are important.

Ratios: The cropping appears to take place when Netflix attempts to make widescreen films fit the screens. This shows the original version of Last Action Hero

Altered: As this image shows, the Netflix version again cuts out a large section of the original

Original: This is a scene from the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ

Radical: But in the Netflix version, it entirely missed out one of the men hanging on a crucifix

'You don’t go around chopping off the
tops of paintings so they fit in the frames you’ve got lying around, 
and you don’t go around slicing off the edges of movies so you don’t 
have to deal with letterboxing.

'And if Netflix is going to insist on
doing so, they should at least have the courtesy to tell us they’re 
monkeying with their merchandise.'

A Netflix spokesman said: 'We want to offer the best picture and provide the original aspect ratio of any title on Netflix.

'However, unfortunately our quality controls sometimes fail and we end up offering the wrong version of a title.

'When we discover this error, we work to replace that title as soon as possible.'

Netflix has 27 million Internet video 
subscribers in the U.S. with 6 million customers in more than 50 other 
countries and territories.
