With the head of a pit bull and the body of a dachshund, he is certainly an extraordinary pup.

But Rami hasn't allowed his unusual appearance to get in the way of his popularity and success.

The rare mixed-breed dog - who has caused a storm of interest online due to his striking looks  - has just become an 'ambassador' for The Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society in Georgia.

In his new position at the local shelter - where he currently resides - he will train to become a special therapy dog and will work to raise awareness of other pets in need of loving homes across the US.

Striking: Rami - who has the head of a pit bull and the body of a dachshund - has just become an 'ambassador' for The Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society. He has generated a huge online following due to his looks

Announcement: On Saturday, Rami's Facebook page - which has gained more than 4,500 fans in just three weeks and even sells T-shirts in the pup's likeness - publicized his 'ambassador' appointment in a post

On Saturday, Rami's  Facebook page - which has gained more than 4,500 fans in just three weeks and even sells T-shirts in the pup's likeness - publicized his  'ambassador' appointment in a post.

The post, written in the pup's voice, read: 'Rami has been chosen to be the MCCHS Ambassador! For all of you that are concerned for my well being, please be assured that I am being well taken care of and loved. I love having the opportunity to meet and greet everyone during the day.

'At night I go to my other home where I can play and sleep with my fosters. No more worries as a dog on the street, now I have food in my tummy, a warm cozy bed, and lots of friends and most important...LOVE!!... I'm thankful to be given this chance to become Ambassador.'

And Rami's new position is not his only success - he has received so many offers of adoption that the rescue shelter in 1st Street Northeast has declared it is no longer accepting applications.

A popular choice: And Rami's (left and right) new title is not his only success - he has received so many offers of adoption that the rescue shelter in 1st Street Northeast has declared it is no longer accepting applications

Staff are currently reviewing applications for the pup, who was rescued after being spotted wandering the streets of Moultrie last month. He rose to fame just days later.

In a Facebook post, the shelter said: 'We will do everything possible to place Rami in a very deserving home, so we ask you be patient with us as every application will be carefully reviewed.'

While Rami's body is long, his legs are more muscular like those of a pit bull. According to the dog breeding website Designer Mixes, the mix of pit bulls and dachshunds is called a Doxbull or Pitwee.

The cross-breeds can weigh around 25lbs when fully grown. Unfortunately for Rami, his enormous pit bull head has seen him compared to a Tyrannosaurus Rex and even a bobblehead doll.

Overwhelmed: The Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society posted this message on Facebook earlier this month, encouraging users to visit their local shelters, where they 'may find a dog or cat as unique as Rami'

Photos and videos of the dog have been shared more than 40,000 times online. Most users say Rami is adorable. However, others are not impressed, describing the pup as 'freaky looking'.

At first, some were even unconvinced and thought the pictures were doctored, or that the animal was not a mix but actually has canine dwarfism, a condition that affects dogs' growth and spines.

According to the Humane Society, Rami is 'full of energy', 'hyper' and doesn't 'listen very well'.

Rami's ears have also been cut for an unknown reason. Potential owners have been told they will need to go through an interview process and pay for Rami's vaccinations before taking him home.

The pup will shortly begin his therapy training with Leigh Ann Facloner, of Bark Busters.
