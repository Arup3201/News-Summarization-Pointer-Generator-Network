A federal court ruled Monday that Chicago's ban on private gun ownership, one of the nation's toughest, violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of individuals' rights to bear arms.

The decision was the fourth major court ruling in recent years to go against the Windy City, in a trend that has Second Amendment supporters trouncing gun-control advocates even in the face of widely publicized school massacres and other public shootings.

The city 'has not demonstrated that 
allowing gun sales and transfers within city limits creates such genuine
 and serious risks to public safety that flatly prohibiting them is 
justified,' read the 35-page decision of Judge Edmond E. Chang in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

President Barack Obama named Chang to the federal bench in 2010. The judge put a hold on his own decision so the city can appeal to a higher court.

He also said that a less restrictive law might pass judicial muster.

Scenes from a future Chicago? The federal court ruling means individual Chicagoans could soon be allowed to purchase and keep handguns for their own protection

Not happy: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wants to see his city's crime rate to continue its downward slide, and doesn't believe an armed citizenry will help

Self-protection: Gun-rights crusaders say Americans, especially those living in urban areas, should be allowed to arm themselves and learn how to use guns in self-defense

Chicago's gun ban, intended to improve public safety, included a zoning ordinance that prohibited licensed gun dealers, banned individuals from selling guns, and barred Chicagoans from giving firearms to family members.

Data published in December show, Chicago's murder rate is at a 35-year low.

But despite the tough restrictions, said Roderick Drew, a spokesman for Chicago’s law department, 'every year Chicago police recover more illegal guns than officers in any city in the country.'

Drew attributed that statistic to 'lax federal laws' and 'lax laws in Illinois and surrounding states related to straw purchasing and the transfer of guns.'

But 'certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution [and] put outside government’s reach,' wrote Judge Chang, 'including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment.'

While that constitutional right has its limits – felons and the mentally ill can't buy guns, for instance – Chang insisted that 'Chicago’s ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms, and at the same time the evidence does not support that the complete ban sufficiently furthers the purposes that the ordinance tries to serve.'

Pioneer: Dick Heller sued the District of Columbia after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home for protection, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor -- setting the stage for the 'McDonald' ruling that forces state and local governments to observe the Second Amendment

Not likely to become legal: If Chicago is forced to allow gun sales within its borders, it will likely limit them to handguns and exclude so-called 'assault rifles' like this AR-15

National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde told the Associated Press that the court decision 'shows how out of step and outrageous Chicago’s ordinances really are.'

City with the big recoil: Guns like this Glock .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol could go on sale in Chicago if the city loses what it a near-certain appeal

Second Amendment Foundation Vice President Alan Gottlieb told MailOnline that 'once again it has taken a federal court ruling to convince city government that Chicago is not a city-state in the middle of the United States, but part of a nation that is bound by the Constitution and must honor all of its provisions, including the right to keep and bear arms..'

Gotlieb's statement had the ring of a victory lap: It was his organization that pushed the landmark Supreme Court case that determined states, not just the federal government, must observe citizens' Second Amendment rights.

That case, McDonald v. City of Chicago, was decided in 2010. It 'paved the way' for Monday's ruling, Gottlieb said.

The NRA has complained that the city of Chicago has ignored that ruling from the high court for more than three years.

'Chicago's continued refusal to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's clear directive in its landmark ruling ... is unacceptable, Chris W. Cox, Executive Director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.

'The NRA will continue to challenge the city until it fully respects the right of its law-abiding residents to keep and bear arms.'
