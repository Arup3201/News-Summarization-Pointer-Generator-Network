New details emerged this week during a preliminary hearing for a Tennessee man accused of shooting dead his 34-year-old wife in the family home while his two-year-old child was left alone upstairs in a crib.

The court heard that Randolph Maidens, 42, fled his Brentwood home on April 21st, leaving behind his dead wife Dr. Rachael Maidens, a confessional note on the kitchen counter, a shotgun on the couch, a car trunk stuffed with $87,200 and his young daughter who told responding officers, 'Daddy gone!'

A coroner's report indicates that the orthodontist was found on the ground floor of the couple's home and died from multiple gunshot wounds said Lt. John Wood of the Brentwood Police Department.

Court Hearing: Randolph Maidens appears in court on Thursday during a preliminary hearing in his trial for murdering his wife, Dr. Rachael Maidens

Police rushed to the plush home after a request by Dr. Maidens mother to check on her daughter after she suspected that Maidens might cause harm to his wife and daughter.

The court heard how police could not raise anyone by knocking the door, so entered the property through an unlocked garage door and after announcing they were in the home heard a young child announce, 'I'm here.'

The young child told officers that her father was gone and then were presented with the shocking sight of Dr. Maidens body wrapped in a blanket in a hallway close to the living room.

A shotgun was rested up against the couch and a note nearby 'expressing regret for what happened' and asking for custody of the child to go to Dr. Maiden's mother.

Officers also discovered $87,200 in his 2013 Infinit parked inside the home garage, including two Fed Ex envelopes filled with cash in a fireproof safe.

While an extensive manhunt could not locate Maidens, he walked back into his home with his hands above his head at around 6 a.m. on April 22nd.

Bail was set at $750,000, lowered from its original $2.5 million but District Attorney General Kim Helper argued at the time for the amount to be higher.

This was because Maidens got into an altercation with three men during a conference he attended in Orlando, Florida earlier in the year - before he became unemployed.

Witnesses who heard the argument allege that Maidens made statements in which he admitted wanting to kill his wife.

However, Maidens' attorney, David Raybin, said that his client showed no intention of fleeing as his passport was in his desk drawer and pointed to the fact he surrendered himself freely.

Murdered: Randolph Maidens allegedly killed his wife Rachael Maidens in their gated community home

On the evening of the murder, Brentwood police, helped by a SWAT
Team, a K-9 unit and 
helicopters, launched an overnight manhunt for Maidens and put the gated community on lockdown as they searched the area.

Maidens eventually walked out of the woods behind the back of his house and was taken into custody without incident at 6 am on Monday, ABC News reported.

At the time one neighbor described how she witnessed Maidens acting bizarrely three weeks before the shooting.

'I saw him running through the woods behind our house, and he a had on a black ski 
mask and a backpack that looked like a quiver,' the neighbor told WKRN-TV.

'It was daytime 
and he was running through the woods... and down to the ravine, right past our house, and I followed him 
and he laid down in the ravine and pulled off the ski mask.'

When she asked him what he was doing, 'he made some 
kind of statement that made no sense' before adding, 'Well, I was walking my dogs, I got lost', she said.

Maidens appeared before a Williamson 
County magistrate judge In April and was charged with homicide in the 
death of his wife, the Williamson County Sheriff's Department told ABC 
News.

He has no criminal record but on February 23, he was arrested for driving under the influence and refusing to take a Breathalyzer test, records show.

Hunt: Police deployed helicopters and K-9 units to search for Maidens after the body of his wife was found

Ripped apart: Maidens is in jail on $750,000 bond while the couple's daughter is now with relatives

He was released on $1,500 cash bond and will appear in court on May 29 at 9 a.m. for the charge.

Rachael Maidens owned an orthodontist practice, RM Orthodontics, in Maryland Farms.

'I think to say just how sorry I am and I'm going to miss coming to the office and seeing her,' former patient Cindy Bayer told News Channel 5. 'She always had a smile and was always friendly. She obviously enjoyed what she did, so it's a shame that her life's work is gone.'

Mrs Maidens, who grew up in Brentwood, met her husband while practicing in Atlanta for three years.

The couple's daughter has been placed with relatives.
