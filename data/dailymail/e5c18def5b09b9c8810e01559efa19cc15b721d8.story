Tristen Kurilla, the 10-year-old boy who's been in an adult jail since authorities say he fatally beat 90-year-old Helen Novak two months ago is scared, lonely and misses his mother, his public defender said.

Kurilla, one of the youngest ever to face an adult homicide charge in Pennsylvania, met with family through a glass partition when he was first brought to the county lockup in rural northeastern Pennsylvania.

More recently, he was permitted to have physical contact with them, according to the attorney, Scott Bennett.

'So his mom can give him a hug,' he said this week of the meeting between Martha Virbitsky and her son.

'Pint-size killer': Tristen Kurilla, 10, pictured left and right with his mother, has been charged as an adult in the death of 90-year-old Helen Novak, whom he allegedly hooked by the neck with her cane 

The beating occurred October 11 at the home of the boy's grandfather, who had been caring for the victim, Helen Novak. 

Kurilla became angered when he went into Novak's room to ask her a question and she yelled at him, according to the boy's mother, who brought him to a state police barracks later that day.

According Virbitsky, her son told her that 'he got mad, lost his temper and grabbed a cane and put it around Novak's throat,' police said.

The 10-year-old told a trooper he punched her several times in the throat and stomach while holding her down on the bed, authorities have said.

Kurilla has since met with a psychiatrist retained by the attorney general's office. The defense intends to have him see its own mental health expert, and Bennett said he will seek a transfer to juvenile court.

He wants the boy treated in a youth facility.

'He's doing as well as can be expected. He's a 10-year-old kid away from his family. This is not an easy thing,' Bennett said.

Currently Kurilla is housed away from the adult population, but he's not in solitary confinement, according to the jail outside Honesdale.

His cell doors are opened in the morning and locked at night, like the other inmates. He is supplied with books and movies, and a certified teacher helps him keep up with his schooling, said Vicky Botjer, chief clerk of Wayne County.

'The Wayne County Correctional Facility is housing the defendant in a safe environment,' she said via email.

Confession: The boy allegedly told police he 'killed that lady,' even though he was only 'trying to hurt her'

An attorney who initially represented the boy had petitioned to have him released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility. 

But he withdrew his request, saying the family wasn't comfortable having him placed in their care, and the closest youth facility was 80 miles away.

So the child has remained in the adult jail.

Marsha Levick, chief counsel of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia, questioned what she viewed as a lack of urgency in the case. Even if the boy is being treated well, an adult lockup simply isn't equipped to meet a child's needs, she said.

'It's shocking. I'm not sure there's another state in the country where we would see this, a 10-year-old boy sitting in an adult county jail for two months,' she said. 

'This is not in any way to diminish the crime he is charged with, which is the most serious crime, but we don't treat children in this country this way.'

A spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the boy, declined to comment.

Police said an autopsy performed Monday at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale indicated blunt force trauma to the victim's neck, and the death was ruled a homicide.

Dr. Gary Ross also said the boy's account to police 'was consistent with the injuries he observed.'

Tristen was charged as an adult with criminal homicide and aggravated assault, with the prosecutor's office noting that the crime of homicide 'is specifically excluded from the juvenile act' and therefore 'a juvenile who commits the crime of homicide is charged as an adult.'

Anthony Virbitsky, 69, Tristen’s grandfather who has been looking after Ms Novak, went into her room at around 10.30am and found her breathing heavy and looking terrified.

About 30 minutes later, the caretaker checked up on her again and found the 90-year-old unresponsive.

When interviewed by police Saturday, Tristen Kurilla reportedly told a trooper: 'I killed that lady.'
