A woman was bombarded with violent threats from animal lovers on Facebook after allegedly locking her cat in a travel basket and placing it in a half-full bath because it ate her pizza.

The woman from Swansea, south Wales, was subject to a torrent of online abuse after telling friends on the social media site she had put the cat 'knee deep' in water for eating her food.

Animal lovers from around the world bombarded the 22-year-old with abuse before engaging the RSPCA and local police force. 

A Facebook user was bombarded with violent threats after posting a photograph online claiming to show her cat locked in a travel basket in half-a-bath of water 

Officials later visited the woman's home, but did not bring any charges against her. 

Within hours of uploading the photograph hundreds of people had shared her post with disgust. 

More than 3,000 people signed an online petition started in America to have the cat's owner investigated by animal rights authorities, while others subjected her to violent threats and even shared her home address online.  

'If you carefully look at the photo, you can’t actually see the cat taking a bath, which technically means there is no actual evidence,' the petition said. 

'In a Facebook post published yesterday, she claims she did not put down her cat and criticized animal lovers for attacking her.

'I am personally not making any accusations - it might all prove to be one big fat joke. 

When questioned by friends, the cat-owner said she put the animal 'knee deep' in water for an hour 

'But if this is true, this incident is unacceptable. At this point, details are rather scarce, so by this petition I am urging the RSPCA to intervene and launch an investigation into this matter as soon as possible.

'We want answers and we want to find out if the cat is okay!'

Other animal lovers threatened the cat-owner with violence and even shared her home address on social media sites. 

'£15 to spend on a pizza ???? Try buying your cat some food instead. No animal would eat a pizza unless they were starving,' one user said. 

Today the RSPCA confirmed they responded to reports of animal cruelty at the woman's house, but left satisfied there was no further danger to the animal. 

Facebook users bombarded the woman with online abuse and death threats after noticing the post 

'We can confirm that we were alerted to a photograph on Facebook which appears to show a cat being placed in to a travel basket and put in to a bath of water as a form of punishment,' a spokesman said. 

'Our inspectors have investigated the matter and checked the cat's welfare. They have also spoken to the person involved in the incident and given them advice.'

'We are grateful to the members of the public who brought this matter to our attention and we would like to reassure people that the cat involved in the incident was, thankfully, unharmed.

'We would strongly advise against reprimanding any animal and the RSPCA believes the best form of training is through positive reinforcement.'
