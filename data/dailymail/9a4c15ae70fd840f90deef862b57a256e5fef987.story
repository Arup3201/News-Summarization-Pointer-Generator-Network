Kris Jenner is not only giving her daughter Kendall’s new relationship with Dallas Mavericks forward Chandler Parsons two thumbs up… she’s is the one who set them up in the first place!

And now the kids are so crazy about each other that Chandler just turned his back on his first big showbiz break just to stay true to the youngest Jenner. Days before he was supposed to show up on set for his starring role in a reality dating show for Relativity Television, Chandler announced that he was opting out.

‘Mama Kris met Chandler a few weeks ago and was blown away by not only his good looks, but his promising B-ball future,’ says a source.

Even though he's 25, and her youngest offspring is only 18, she immediately flew into matchmaking mode. Now the kids have fallen head over heels for each other.

Kendall was linked with Harry Styles and 5SOS singer Ashton Irwin in recent months.

Asked about being spotted with Kendall in Los Angeles by Chelsea Handler on her show last night, the 6'9" Chandler, known to his friends as Chan, hedged and said they were out but in a group. He also claimed that he didn't have a girlfriend.

Asked about the relationship by MailOnline, he had 'no comment'.

As MailOnline reported recently, Kendall and her sister Kylie were spotted dinning out at STK LA recently with Parsons and a few pals. But what wasn’t confirmed at the time was that the twosome was already a couple.

People reported that they were 'flirting heavily'.

And while Kris Jenner is happy she's found a new man for Kendall, she's thrilled she could also be gaining a new sexy cast member on Keeping up with The Kardashians.

Parsons just signed a $46m, three-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks. And his handsome looks also landed him a modeling contract with Buffalo Jeans.

But not everyone is happy about the new coupling… especially producers of a new reality dating show that was supposed to star Parsons.

‘Chandler was just about to start filming a series similar to The Bachelor,’ says the source. ‘He was going to be introduced to a group of gorgeous women in hopes of being fixed up with the girl of his dreams.

'But before the cameras had a chance to roll, he’s pulled out of the show.’

A spokesperson for Relativity TV says that Chandler is not planning to do a reality show of any kind.

The source adds that when it came down to the wire, Kendall couldn’t stand the thought of Chandler kissing another girl, even if it might be just for the cameras. So Parsons backed out of the show.

‘Lots of girls are warned off dating athletes by friends,’ says the source. 'But in Parsons' case, it’s his buddies who are warning him against dating a Kardashian!

‘Everyone knows that when you date a Kardashian… you have to deal with Kris who is totally enmeshed in the lives of her kids,’ says the source. ‘No matter how hot Kendall is, it’s not worth it.

'Let’s face it… one of the Kardashian girls is always romancing a handsome athlete.  You had your Reggie Bush, your Kris Humphries, your Lamar Odem, and now you got the new kid on the roster… Chandler Parsons! '

And while Kris Jenner is over the moon that her game plan to make a couple out of Kendall and Chandler is obviously working, Kendall’s pop, Bruce Jenner, isn’t all that thrilled.

‘On one hand Bruce knows how most professional athletes are major players and he doesn’t want that for his daughter. On the other hand, he doesn’t want to cause trouble since his daughter’s already been through so much this year with her parents' separation.

‘Besides, it would be like trying to close the barn door after the horse is already out.’
