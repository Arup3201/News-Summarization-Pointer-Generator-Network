A top Roman Catholic state school attended by Nick Clegg's eldest son and two of Tony Blair's has been ordered to revise its 'discriminatory' admissions policy and accept children from less-privileged backgrounds. 

The London Oratory School has been heavily criticised by the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) for engaging in 'social selection', saying their entrance system had broken admission rules in 105 ways.

It prioritised children based on whether they sing in the choir, arrange flowers in church, serve at the altar or assist in pastoral work such as visiting the needy.

Condemned: The London Oratory school has been criticised for engaging in 'social selection'. The Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) said it had broken admission rules in 105 ways 

In its ruling, the watchdog said the school must not prioritise places for children 'on the basis of any practical or financial support parents may give to the school', nor should children be favoured on the basis of their hobbies and activities.

The school, which is heavily over-subscribed and offers education to boys aged between seven and 18 and girls aged between 16 and 18, has been told it must alter its admissions policy so as not to discriminate against people from working-class or non-Catholic backgrounds.

In the damning report, published today, its author Dr Bryan Slater said: 'From the evidence which I have seen there is good reason to believe that the admission arrangements which the school uses have the effect of acting to produce at the very least a degree of social selection.

'I am not convinced that the school can claim a high level of ethnic diversity in real terms since it is clearly less ethnically diverse than other schools in the place in which it is located.'

It said of the 13 state-funded Catholic secondary schools in the nearby area, London Oratory has the highest proportion of white British pupils, the lowest proportion of non-white pupils, and the lowest proportion of those of African heritage.

Dr Slater said: 'It seems to me instead that the diversity within the school is the lowest, or very nearly the lowest, of that found in all 13 schools.'

He said that the percentage of children receiving free school meals - often an indicator of poverty - was 6-7 per cent. This is well down on the most recent figures for the borough, at 25.1 per cent.

Mr Clegg's son eldest Antonio, 12, attends, while former prime minister Tony Blair sent his two eldest sons, Nicky and Euan, to the school with daughter Kathryn believed to have joined in the sixth form.

A DfE spokesperson said: 'All schools must abide by an adjudicator's determination. We expect them to amend their arrangements to comply at the earliest opportunity.'

Nobody from the school was able to comment.

A complaint by the British Humanist Association (BHA) was original upheld last August before being quashed in January on a technicality.

BHA spokesman Richy Thompson described today's announcement as 'the most comprehensive we have ever seen'.

He said: 'The London Oratory School is one of the ten most socio-economically selective state secondary schools in England.

'It is vital that no school discriminates against any pupil on the basis of religion, ethnicity or social standing and we are glad that the school must now rewrite its admissions policy to lessen the degree of discrimination on all fronts.'
