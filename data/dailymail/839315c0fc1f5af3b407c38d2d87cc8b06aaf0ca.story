A U.S. Marine is presumed lost at sea after bailing out from a MV-22 Osprey plane after it lost power over the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced today

The tilt-rotor aircraft - which can take off and land like a helicopter, but fly like a fixed-wig plane - had just taken off from the amphibious assault ship U.S.S. Makin Island when it suddenly lost power. 

Two crew members bailed out, but the pilot stayed on board and was able to save the $70million aircraft and land it again on the deck of the ship.

Numerous ships from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy's Fifth Fleet scoured the area in search of the crew members.

One Marine was rescued and is recovering aboard a Navy ship. 

The other was not found. The service member has not been identified.  

The Makin Island - which can carry Harrier jets, an assortment of helicopters, up to 22 Osprey planes and nearly 2,000 Marines - is currently stationed in Bahrain to support military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. 

Bahrain is home to the Navy's Fifth Fleet.  

The San Diego-based warship left for the Middle East on July 25. 

It carried elements of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is also based in San Diego.

The MV-22 (like the one pictured here) is a title-rotor aircraft capable of taking off and landing like a helicopter, but can fly like an airplane

The V-22 is a small, fast transport plane that is able to fly and maneuver like an airplane, but can take off and land on ship decks and makeshift landing pads like a helicopter.

Each plane can carry up to 36 troops or a small, specially designed fighting Growler vehicle. 

Its $35billion development, long delayed and far over-budget, came at the cost of several deadly crashes. 

More recently, though, the aircraft has had a slightly better record. 

Two crashes in 2012, however, raised questions. One on a training exercise in Morocco killed two Marines. In another, the aircraft flipped over at a Florida air base and injured all five aboard.
