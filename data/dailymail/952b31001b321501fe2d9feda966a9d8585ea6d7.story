Australia has been ranked the top destination where half of Britons secretly dream of jetting off on holiday.

However, although the draw of sun, sea and sightseeing Down Under may be strong, 90 per cent of people also revealed they will never make it to their perfect destination.

Just one in ten Brits believes they will make it to Australia for a holiday, with the rest calling it just a pipe dream, according to a survey.

Three quarters  revealed that their dream destination was just too expensive to afford, while a further 18 per cent of the 2,000 people surveyed admitted that they could not get enough time off work to go.

But it's not just Australia that Brits would like to visit. 

They have also set their hearts on New Zealand (47 per cent), Canada (42 per cent) and The Maldives (31 per cent) as other top destinations.

Myles Stephenson, CEO of my Travel Cash, which commissioned the survey, said: 'We wanted to get a real insight into where people dream of travelling to.

'We discovered that nine out of ten people don't think they'll ever make their dream trip, with time off and cost being the most prohibiting factors.'

He added: 'Contrary to popular belief, that dream destination may be more achievable than people think.

'Pound sterling is currently experiencing a five-year high against currencies including the US dollar, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, meaning holiday money can stretch a lot further than people might think.'

Holiday envy was also revealed as a common trend, as one in two Brits admitted to feeling jealous of friends and family visiting their dream destination instead of them.

One third admitted to coming close to booking their dream getaway, while over a quarter revealed that this had happened a number of times.

In stark contrast, Brits also revealed that they would sacrifice their fantasy to enjoy a holiday closer to home while creating treasured memories with family and friends  (62 per cent).
