Russia defied the world yesterday as it vetoed a UN resolution that declared today’s referendum on the status of Crimea invalid.

Samantha Power, America’s ambassador to the UN, berated her Russian counterpart, Vitaly Churkin, at an emergency meeting of the Security Council in New York, saying his country stood alone and its actions were wrong. 

Thirteen countries voted in favour of the resolution. Russia voted against the motion, while China abstained.

Terse words: American ambassador Samantha Power launched towards Russia's Vitaly Churkin during the vote

The resolution called on ‘all states, international organisations and agencies not to recognise any alteration of the status of Crimea on the basis of the referendum’.

Later, the Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the resolution as another American attempt to interfere in Ukraine.

But Ms Power – an Irish-born diplomat and academic who has held various senior positions in Barack Obama’s administration – said: ‘Crimea will be part of Ukraine unless and until its status is changed in accordance of Ukrainian and international law.’

Visibly enraged, she discussed options with Ukraine's Yuriy Sergeyev (second left) ahead of the vote

Mr Churkin was the only country to vote against the motion. China abstained, and 13 voted in favour
