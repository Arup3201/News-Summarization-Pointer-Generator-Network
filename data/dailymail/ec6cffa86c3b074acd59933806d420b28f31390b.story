Losing your sunglasses is bad enough when they cost very little, but when you’ve shelled out for an expensive pair of designer frames, misplacing them is like throwing money down the drain.

That’s where Tzukuri glasses come in. The $350 (£207) frames are embedded with tiny solar-powered Bluetooth sensors that link with a smartphone and send alerts if the glasses are left behind.

An alert is sent when the glasses are 16ft (5m), 32ft (10m) and 50ft (15m) away, and these alerts contain locations tag to help owners find them - even in wide-open spaces.

There are six frames to choose from, each inspired by a famous fashion or cultural icon.

These
 include the Atticus frames, named after To Kill A Mockingbird character Atticus 
Finch, played by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film.

Fitzgerald frames were designed on sunglasses worn by President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

The
 Ford range were inspired by fashion designer and director Tom Ford, 
while the Lennon frames look like John Lennon’s infamous rounded 
glasses.

Grace Kelly, 
actress and once Princess Consort of Monaco inspired the Monaco frames, and the Truman range was designed in the style of Phillip Seymour 
Hoffman’s glasses in the film Truman Capote.

If any of these notifications are dismissed, for example if the wearer has deliberately left the glasses at home on a rainy day, they will stop appearing for the rest of the day.

The app will also disable alerts when the wearer is at home or at work.

And because the sensor is solar-powered, the battery and location beacon will stay on.

The firm said it used 3D analysis of thousands of faces, pictured left, to develop frames that fit 'more harmoniously with a broader range of facial structures.'

The firm uses Apple's iBeacon Bluetooth technology in its sensor, pictured. It is only compatible with the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and 5C

‘Our frames are handmade in Japan by the best artisans in the world,’ said Tszukuri.

‘Every frame is fitted with the highest quality polarised, anti-scratch lenses with 100 per cent UV protection.

‘By 3D analysing thousands of faces, we developed frames that fit more harmoniously with a broader range of facial structures.

‘The result is six designs specifically refined to bring out the best in every face.’

Tzukuri plans to launch the range by the end of the year with prices starting at $350 (£207) although buyers who pay a $50 (£30) deposit now can get the frames for $200 (£118).
