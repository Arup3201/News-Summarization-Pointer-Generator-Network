Dr Prashen Pillay, who accidentally prescribed 77-year old Joan Dixon a cardiac drug at 1,000 times the recommended dose, embarked on a two-year hellraising spree

A disgraced doctor who accidentally killed a patient after prescribing a lethal dose of drugs then went on a two year hell-raising spree around Britain, a tribunal heard.

Dr Prashen Pillay did runners from restaurants, hotels and petrol stations and was even caught urinating in front of shocked shoppers at Morrisons supermarket.

Despite being suspended from practicing medicine, the 43-year-old turned up at a London hospital London falsely claiming he was qualified to carry out treatment and attempted to move a patient.

Pillay even turned up at a medical school in Durham where the deputy head found him addressing a class of students in the lecture theatre, Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard.

A disciplinary panel at the hearing in Manchester branded his behaviour 'disgraceful, appalling, deliberate and calculating'.

The tribunal was told Pillay had qualified from medical school in 2009 and in August the following year began working as a trainee at St Richards Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex.

Tragedy occurred in October of that year whilst Joan Dixon, who had a history of heart problems, was being treated for a fractured hip following a fall.

The doctor had accidentally prescribed the 77-year old with a dose of cardiac drug Digoxin 1,000 times the recommended level after he wrote milligrams instead of microgrammes on a doctor's note.  

After receiving up to 2.5mg of the drug - ten times thenormal dose - Mrs Dixon suffered a heart attack. 

She died 15 minutes later after Pillay failed to tell his superiors or make the cardiac arrest team aware of her deteriorating condition. 

When questioned Pillay, who had not written out the prescription in full as per NHS practice, said: 'Somewhere between my brain and my right hand microgrammes turned into milligrammes.' 

He also mistakenly prescribed an excessive dose of insulin to a diabetic patient- who escaped with a mild episode of hypoglycemia. 

At the fitness to practise hearing an expert witness said of Mrs Dixon's case: 'The prescription of 1,000 times the required dose is an extremely serous matter. 

Tragedy occurred in October 2010 whilst Joan Dixon, 77, who had a history of heart problems, was being treated for a fractured hip following a fall at St Richard's Hospital and was prescribed a lethal dose of drugs by Dr Pillay 

The disgraced doctor was caught urinating on the floor at Morrisons supermarket in Sutton, London in front of shocked shoppers

'Even a Foundation Year One doctor should have been aware of the approximate dose range and should not have prescribed this dose in milligrams. This error fell seriously below the standard normally expected of an FY1 doctor.'

At an inquest in 2012 Pillay pledged to 'make it my life's work to ensure another tragedy like the death of Mrs Dixon never took place again

Following Mrs Dixon's death, Pillay was excluded from West Sussex Hospitals Foundation Trust and was later given an interim suspension prohibiting from practicing medicine.

At an inquest in 2012 he pledged to 'make it my life's work to ensure this can't happen again' and told Mrs Dixon's family: 'I want to say sorry. I really liked your mum. She was hard work but she was funny and I have to live with that for the rest of my life and my career.'

Despite his public pledge, Pillay went onto be repeatedly hauled into various courts around the UK and rocked up at operations or incidents claiming he was qualified to treat patients. 

In August 2012, he was given an £80 fixed penalty notice after he urinated on the floor of Morrisons supermarket in Sutton, London.

In that same month he was £400 for using threatening behaviour in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and in September 2012 he fined £55 for doing runners from Penny Bridge Hotel in Lancaster and Alfredo's restaurant in Morecambe.

In April 2014 he was issued with another fixed penalty for being drunk and refusing to pay a £28 bar bill at a Premier Inn in Stockton-on-Tees and the following August was fined £200 for doing a runner from a hotel and failing to pay a £30 taxi fare.

In one incident Pillay wandered up to St George's Hospital in Tooting, London and relayed a fabricated story to anaesthetic staff that he was undertaking an official 'clinical observership'. He then falsely told a doctor his issues with the General Medical Council had been resolved and he was about to return to medical practice.

Pillay then changed into operating clothes, walked into the operating theatre and cannulated a patient - inserting a tube into the vein. He also maintained the patient's airway and attempted to assist with their transfer, all while he was banned from duty and not even supposed to be in the hospital.

In a separate incident last year, Pillay went to the aid of a woman who had collapsed in Shepherd's Bush, London, but began concocting further tales to the emergency services who arrived at the scene.

He falsely told police he was an anesthetist before  telling a paramedic he was an A&E doctor in Derby. When the paramedic who questioned his credentials he swore at him saying: 'Who's the one with the medical degree. What do you do for a 'f***ing job.' 

Dr Pillay was also fined for doing a runner without paying from Alfredo's restaurant in Morecambe

In April 2014 he was issued with another fixed penalty for being drunk and refusing to pay a £28 bar bill at a Premier Inn in Stockton-on-Tees and the following August was fined £200 for doing a runner from a hotel and failing to pay a £30 taxi fare

The deputy head of undergraduate medicine at Durham University School recalled how Pillay approached her claiming he had moved back into the area and had a secured a job at a local hospital. He later turned up for a lecture on anorexia claiming to be an expert on clinical skills and was already speaking to the students when the lecturer arrived.

At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester, a disciplinary panel  found Pillay, who was not at the hearing, guilty of 26 misconduct charges and ordered him to be struck off 

The MPTS panel said: 'The combination of Dr Pillay's misconduct and his convictions amounts to a particularly serious departure from good medical practise.

'He abused his position to gain access to an operating theatre, to a patient who collapsed in the street and to the students at the medical school. 

'His actions showed a willingness to put his own interests ahead of those of patients, members of the public his colleagues and his regulator. He has shown no insight into the seriousness of his actions and the potential consequences.'
