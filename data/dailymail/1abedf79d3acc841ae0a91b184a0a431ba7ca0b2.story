The man that Matthew McConaughey plays in Dallas Buyers Club is portrayed as a heterosexual, homophobic electrician – but he has been described variously as bisexual and even gay by those who knew him in real life.

The Oscar-nominated movie tells the courageous story of Ron Woodroof, who was diagnosed with Aids in 1986 and given just six months to live, but who survived several years more after taking banned medication that he smuggled into the U.S.

He set up a ‘buyers club’ in his home city of Dallas, which enabled others diagnosed with the same disease to buy medication that would help them live that bit longer, too.

He was a drug user and had many girlfriends – leaving his family unclear exactly how he contracted HIV.

But the way that Woodroof, who died in 1992, is portrayed in the film as a straight man has shocked many that knew him.

Woodroof’s doctor, Dr Steven Pounders, told Slate magazine: ‘I never witnessed any homophobia in the time I knew him from 1988 through his death in 1992. He fit right in the gay environment without problems. Brenda, his ex-wife, stated that he was bisexual.’

His nurse Penny Krispin told The Sunday Times that Ron was one of her ‘gay patients’ and added: ‘I never knew anyone who thought Ron was straight.’

Meanwhile, Dallas Life reporter Bill Minutaglio interviewed Woodroof and concluded that ‘he was not homophobic’.

The depiction of Woodroof as a homophobic straight man appears to have come from a series of  interviews the film’s screen-writer Craig Borten conducted with him.

Borten’s press agent told Slate that during three days of chats Woodroof made multiple homophobic comments, introduced the writer to a woman he said was his girlfriend and talked graphically about anal sex with women.

Dallas Buyers Club has been nominated for Best Picture in 2014's Oscars and Texan-born McConaughey received his first Best Actor nod for his portrayal of Woodroof.

He endured extreme dieting to make his appearance as realistic as possible.

'I’ve got a pretty full tank of energy when it comes to what we did in this film,' he told The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of his nomination. 'I’ve got a lot of stories to share. It excites me to share the story each time I talk about it. There’s always a fresh subject. It means something different to everyone.'
