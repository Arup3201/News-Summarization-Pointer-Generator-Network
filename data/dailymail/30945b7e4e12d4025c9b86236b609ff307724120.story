Authorities say the longtime top prosecutor in Carroll County is dead of an apparent suicide. 

The Carroll County Sheriff's Office says Jerry Barnes was found around 10:30 a.m. Saturday morning at a home in Westminster with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Barnes was taken to a hospital, where he died.

The 66-year-old Barnes had served as state's attorney for Carroll County since 1994. He lost his bid for re-election in this year's Republican primary.

Before his career as a prosecutor, Barnes was an Army Green Beret who earned a Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam.

Capt. Richard Hart of the sheriff's office confirmed Barnes' death. Hart said he could not release any further information beyond a short, emailed statement.

He says Barnes' death is under investigation.
