A father-of-six is facing jail for demolishing his family home with a sledgehammer after falling out with his brother over their inheritance.

Furious Tony McGuire battered the £300,000 semi-detached home into pieces while his neighbours looked on.

McGuire, 49, later posed for pictures in the rubble of the house which is at the centre of an ownership dispute with his brother and sister.

He was arrested and hauled in front of court after leaving the house looking like a disaster zone.

Electrician McGuire admitted criminal damage after destroying the privately-owned property.

Judge Daniel Williams told him: 'You pleaded guilty and you will receive credit for this in due course.

'I cannot proceed to sentence you today and will adjourn for a pre-sentence report.

'Do not think this adjournment is an indication of sentence, all sentencing options remain open to the court and this includes custody.'

Mr McGuire's father Allan owned the house in Manor Way, Cardiff, until his death in 2005.

His electrician son later moved in with his wife Darriel, 50, and six children and spent their savings on building extensions and renovations.

But it emerged that his late father had left a will saying the property should be divided between Mr McGuire and his siblings Terry and Tina.

When they failed to come to an agreement Tony took a sledgehammer to the four-bedroom house.

Standing in the rubble at the time he said: 'I did what I had to do - this has been going on for seven years and I’ve had enough.'

Damage to the property has been estimated at £120,000 and McGuire and his family have moved into a property two miles away.

Tony McGuire has been given bail on the condition that he does not contact his siblings or go to the house

He was given bail on the condition that he does not contact his siblings or go to the house.

He will return to court later this month.

Ministry of Justice figures show a 700 per cent rise in High Court inheritance actions in five years.

Experts linked the surge to the recession, which has left relatives inheriting less than they expected.

As a result, families are left ‘fighting over the scraps’.

Lawyers also cited  social changes such as family breakdown. Remarriage and the growth in second families mean there are more potential inheritors.

The number of cases asking for a will to be completely overturned rose from 73 in 2006 to 135 in 2011.
