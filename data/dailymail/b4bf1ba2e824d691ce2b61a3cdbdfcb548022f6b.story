Officials at a New Hampshire high school are refusing to let a senior wear his U.S. Marine Corps uniform to graduation instead of a cap and gown.

Brandon Garabrant, 18, a student at ConVal Regional High School in Peterborough, was planning to wear his newly-acquired U.S. Marines uniform to his graduation ceremony on Saturday.

The school's principal Brian Pickering has told Garabrant that instead, he will be required to wear the traditional cap and gown.

Garabrant will graduate from Marine boot camp on Friday in South Carolina and will return home in time to receive his high school diploma the following day, according My Fox Boston.

Principal Pickering told the New Hampshire Union Leader the decision is 
consistent with the school's plan to have a unified celebration that 
focuses on earning a high school diploma.

Members of the community and Garabrant's peers think the decision is unfair.

'Brandon deserves to wear his uniform,' reads a sign in the window of Kate's Cuts hairdresser, down the road from ConVal High School.

Brandon's mother Jessie Garabrant told the Union Leader, 'I'm overwhelmed with the support of the community. It's just wonderful.'

'People are just outraged, our friends and family. That's how this all started. Brandon doesn't know this has become such a controversy.'

Pickering told the Union Leader that he had made the decision in consultation with his graduation committee, which includes a military wife, a military mother, a retired 
Army Special Forces member, and a retired Marine.

Cap and gown: ConVal High School has said Brandon Garabrant may wear his military uniform under his graduation gown

'With all due respect to the military, it's not a celebration of what's next, what's after that,' Pickering said. 'This has been a procedure for a number of years at ConVal High School.'

The graduation committee told MyFoxBoston.com that Brandon Garabrant is welcome to wear the uniform under his gown and may remove the gown after receiving his diploma.

Meanwhile, Brandon Garabrant is still ensconced in boot camp in South Carolina and is unaware his uniform woes have caused such a stir.
