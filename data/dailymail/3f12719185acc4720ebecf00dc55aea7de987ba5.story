A woman who left a childhood friend in a coma after she ran over him while drunk driving has been jailed for two years.

Sharon Ball, 25, left Sean Clements with shocking back injuries after she struck him with her car while more than two-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit.

Mr Clements, of Viewpark, Lanarkshire, was sitting on a grass verge with friends when Ball sped her Peugeot 307 off the road and slammed into them.

Onlookers managed to pull the car off Mr Clements, who was trapped underneath the vehicle.

The 24-year-old, who was knocked unconscious by the force of the impact, spent a month in hospital and suffered third degree burns to his lower back and buttocks from Ball's spinning tyres.

He had a bruised left lung and cuts to his scalp. He also had extensive skin grafts to treat his burn injuries.

He is now receiving counselling for post-traumatic stress and can't work. 

Ball, a mother-of-one, had previously admitted being drunk at the wheel and striking Mr Clement and his friend Steven Millar with the car last July. 

She was today jailed at Hamilton Sheriff Court and banned from driving for three years.

Defence lawyer John Costello said: 'The choice here is fairly stark and she fully expects to be getting a custodial sentence.

'I would have to concede that it would be merited given the nature of the offence.

'She does though have a young child who would be affected should she be in custody. She has a great deal of regret in this matter which is genuine.

'The complainants were all friends of her when this happened and she shows no malice towards them.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Clements said: 'I'm happy she has got what she deserved.

'Two years is better than nothing but I could have died that night and have been left scarred for life.

'We had been having a drink together that day with other friends and there had been no arguments or anything like that.

'Sharon disappeared at one point and turned up later racing her up and down the street.

'I thought she was just drunk and trying to show off. Then at one point I turned round and all I could see was the lights of the car coming right towards me.

'I had no time to get away and that's the last thing I remember. When I woke up in hospital two days later I couldn't believe it when my mum told me it was Sharon who had hit me.'

Depute fiscal Paula Russell said factory worker Ball had driven at excessive speeds on the night of the incident and given a alcohol reading of 88mcgs of alcohol. The legal limit is 35.

She said: 'As the vehicle stopped both men were underneath it.

'A large number of members of the public physically lifted the vehicle off him and freed him from underneath.

'It was noted by a doctor that without quick treatment Mr Clements' injuries could have been life threatening.'

Sheriff Vincent Smith told Ball her early plea had persuaded him to reduce her jail term from 30 months.

He said: 'You drove in a particular fashion which went way beyond what could be described as dangerous driving.

'You were under the influence of alcohol and you drove a vehicle at speed and you were asked to slow down.

'You then mounted the pavement and persons who you were earlier with were on a grass verge. Two people ended up under the vehicle.

'The victim was taken to hospital and the doctors were of the opinion that had he not had treatment then he would have died.

'I would have imposed a period of 30 months but given the plea that will be reduced to 24 months.'
