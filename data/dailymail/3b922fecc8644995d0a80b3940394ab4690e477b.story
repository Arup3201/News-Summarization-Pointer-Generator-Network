Lewis Hamilton would be happy to lift a Coca-Cola can above his head at next month's British Grand Prix providing it is engraved with the word 'First'.

After collecting an unusual runner-up trophy after Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix, in a more light-hearted moment post race at the Red Bull Ring, Hamilton bemoaned the bizarre designs of current Formula One silverware.

But in turning his attention to his home race at Silverstone on July 6, a race he is naturally desperate to win for a variety of reasons, all Hamilton cares about is he is on the top step of the podium.

Chase: Hamilton has been behind his team-mate Nico Rosberg too often this season, and needs to start winning

It is now six years since his one-and-only victory on home soil, and with the gap at the top of the drivers' standings to title rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg now 29 points, Hamilton knows he has to stop the German's run in front of his own fans.

'Generally, Formula One trophies aren't very good. I was looking back at 2003 and the trophies were awesome. The last few years...' sighed Hamilton.

'Silverstone has a good one, but they don't give it out. You use it and then you give it back.

'But at the end of the day it really doesn't matter what it (the winner's trophy) looks like, so long as it has 'First' on it.

'It could be an old tin can, or a Coca-Cola can with 'First' on it, it really would not matter.

'For Silverstone I cannot really explain how special it would be to win there again. It has been a long time since I did, but when I did it was just unbelievable.

'In 2007 (his debut year) being on pole, that was just such a unique experience.

'You really feel like everyone is with you, like you are doing it together, which is really a strange feeling.

'Then when I won in 2008 (in the wet), coming through the chicane where people were aquaplaning and going off, I could see the crowds getting up and cheering.

'From the corner of my eye I could still see them cheering, and you never want to disappoint them.

'In some races, when you go there and you don't get the result, they are still so supportive afterwards, telling me 'don't worry, next time'.

'I am really confident I can do it this year. I have the car so there is no reason - and Nico's not the reason - why we should not be able to do it.

'It's coming at the right time. I have had a couple of dodgy races, so I need to get it back to how it should be.'

Two retirements for Hamilton, in the opening race in Australia and earlier this month in Canada, have left him playing catch up with Rosberg who has not been out of the top two in the eight races to date.

It is slowly getting to the point where Hamilton requires Rosberg's car to suffer a technical glitch of its own to aid his title cause.

Diplomatic Hamilton, however, would prefer to suggest it is fortune that has so far been lacking.

'I don't hope for anything. I just need some luck to go my way as I have been unfortunate with the two DNFs (did not finish) I've had,' added Hamilton.

'Saturday (in qualifying) was only my first real mistake of the year, so if that was a bad weekend, to still get a 1-2....you just have to step back.

'You can be angry, but I have never had a car like this where I can fight so well with people, follow people and really be in the race.

'It's incredible what this team have done, and I always need to just step back and be grateful to be a part of it.

'There is still a long way to go, a lot of races, so I really need to pull my socks up and capitalise on my own pace, to use that at the weekends otherwise Nico will have it (the title).'
