A brawl broke out between staff and customers at a restaurant after female patrons were told they could not take their alcoholic drinks to go.

The dispute turned physical at Chacho's Mexican restaurant in Houston, Texas last Thursday between three female customers and several male staff members.

In a cellphone video filmed by one woman, a waiter is shown throwing a female customer to the ground while another is put in a headlock.

Community activist Quannel X told Fox: 'When you have a manager that already has an attitude, he don't like the people he is dealing with, speaking to them without respect. 

'Using the b word to address them. That escalated the problem.'

The activist also questioned why no one had been arrested despite the fact one of the men wrestled a woman to the ground.

The women have contacted an attorney and are pursuing legal action because they want the restaurant employees to be brought to justice.

Chacho's owner said that a full investigation will take place by a third party. The video, which was posted on YouTube, has been viewed thousands of times.

Chacho's Mexican restaurant in Houston says it provides 'intelligent service due to well-trained employees who are paid substantially above industry levels'.

The company also addressed the issue of providing magaritas in 'to-go cups' for customers.

A message on the website reads: 'The state alcoholic beverage laws prohibits restaurants from selling margaritas to go. To prevent this, we do not provide to go cups to customers who have ordered margaritas.' 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the restaurant management.
