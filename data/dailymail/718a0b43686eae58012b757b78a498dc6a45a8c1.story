Alex Ferguson could be heading for the red benches of the House of Lords after quitting the Manchester United dug-out.

Labour figures were talking of his being given a peerage as soon as he quit yesterday following 26 hugely successful years at Old Trafford.

Sir Alex, 71, is a lifelong Labour supporter and donor and sources said it was a 'distinct possibility' the party would nominate him for a peerage.

All three main parties are in the 
process of nominating new members to the House of Lords with the names 
set to be published before the summer. His name is not on Labour's list 
but, according to insiders, that might now change.

They said it would be logical to have Sir Alex in the Lords, which is seen as a chamber of experts from different walks of life.

Party leader Ed Miliband issued a 
gushing Commons tribute, calling him 'the most successful football 
manager the world has ever seen'.

An appointment to the Lords would be 
in Mr Miliband's gift since the main parties all have a quota of peers, 
allocated according to the results of the last general election.

Labour MP Graham Stringer plans to 
table an early day motion in the Commons calling for a peerage for Sir 
Alex, who is being replaced by Everton's manager David Moyes.

'He's had an incredible career and 
when you look at the people in the House of Lords there is nobody from 
our favourite game, which is football,' he said.

'Sir Alex, with his record, should be 
in there giving them the benefit of his managerial experience.' Such was
the impact of his departure that United shares fell more than 5 per 
cent in New York, briefly wiping £80million off the market value of the
club.

Ferguson's decision was a major shock 
coming so soon after he clinched his 13th Premier League title with the 
club, one of his 38 trophies including two Champions League trophies.

The announcement appeared to damage the 
club's value on the stock market with shares falling by 4.5 per cent in 
the hours that followed before rallying to 1.76 per cent down.

Only last weekend, in his programme notes for a match against Chelsea, Sir Alex insisted he would carry on.

'I certainly don't have any plans at 
the moment to walk away from what I believe will be something special 
and worth being around to see,' he wrote.

But in a statement announcing the end 
of his managerial career he said: 'The decision to retire is one that I 
have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly. 
It is the right time.

'It was important to me to leave an organisation in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so.'

Sir Alex, who will become a director 
and ambassador for the club, formally retires after United's match with 
West Bromwich Albion on May 18 – his 1,500th in charge.

He paid special tribute to the support
of his family, friends and colleagues throughout his career, 
particularly his wife. He said: 'My wife Cathy has been the key figure 
throughout my career, providing a bedrock of both stability and 
encouragement. Words are not enough to express what this has meant to 
me.'

Lady Ferguson, as his no-nonsense wife
prefers not to be called, may have mixed feelings about her husband's 
decision to retire however.

When he announced for the first time 
he was to quit as Manchester United manager, back in 2001, it was Cathy 
who persuaded him to change his mind. The reason she did, she said, was 
that he would regret the decision.

She knew, deep down, that Sir Alex 
felt his work with the club was incomplete. Yet there were suspicions 
from other quarters that Cathy's motives were not entirely selfless.

'When he's under your feet, it's a nuisance,' she said around that time. 'If he's here too long, he gets in my road.

'I know a lot of people in Aberdeen 
with their men working on rigs. During the two weeks they're back, the 
women are screaming after four or five days.'

This time, Sir Alex's retirement 
appears definite and, while it's possible his wife will find him getting
in the way when he's at home, there's no doubting her devotion to him –
or his to her.

Unlucky for some: Ferguson has got his hands on a the Premier League trophy a remarkable 13 times in all

The 74-year-old has always been by her
husband's side, but she is essentially a private, family-oriented 
woman, devoted to their three sons.

Their 47-year marriage has been conducted in a very definite fashion, with clear rules – all laid down by Cathy.

When Sir Alex goes to work – he 
arrives at the training ground by 7.15am – he is a legendary football 
manager, obsessed with the pursuit of perfection on the pitch.

But at home he's simply Alex, a husband, father and grandfather.

Any talk of football is not permitted 
once he steps over the threshold. Cathy is indifferent to the game and 
will not pretend otherwise.
