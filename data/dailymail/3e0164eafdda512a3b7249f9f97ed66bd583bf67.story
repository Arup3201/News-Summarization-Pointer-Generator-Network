Ukraine warned last night that 80,000 Russian troops were massing on its borders and could invade – as world leaders told Vladimir Putin to back off.

A senior security chief in Kiev said Moscow could launch a full-scale  invasion and Russian troops would be in the Ukrainian capital within ‘two or three hours’ of the order to advance.

Photographs of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers close to Ukraine’s borders added to tensions.

Last night senior British officials told the Mail they had received reports about Russian troops massing on the border since Tuesday and were concerned by the show of force.

British intelligence is unsure whether the movements are intended to back up the annexation of Crimea, preparation for an invasion or simply defensive.

Moscow’s show of force came as Ukraine’s new prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, met Barack Obama in  the Oval Office and Nato continued military exercises in Poland.

On a day of rising tensions, G7 leaders, including David Cameron and Mr Obama, warned Russia not to annexe the Crimea after a referendum on Sunday in the province, which has been taken over by pro-Putin troops.

Their statement warns the Russian president ‘to cease all efforts to change the status of Crimea contrary to Ukrainian law and in violation of international law’ and threatens ‘further action’ if Moscow seizes Crimea.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said Russian MPs who voted to use force in Ukraine and Kremlin officials behind the invasion would be hit with asset freezes and a travel ban to the European Union – most likely at a Brussels summit on Monday.

But the main concern of Western leaders is to deter Russia from seizing the rest of Eastern Ukraine.

The moves come as the Russian armed forces have announced a separate huge military exercise by its airborne troops

Andriy Parubiy, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, yesterday said that even Kiev may not be safe from Putin’s troops, who were regrouping in ‘an offensive manner’.

Mr Parubiy claimed the forces massing included ‘over 80,000 personnel, up to 270 tanks, 180 armoured vehicles, 380 artillery systems, 18 multiple-launch missile systems, 140 combat aircraft, 90 combat helicopters and 19 warships and cutters’.

He added: ‘Critical is the situation not only in Crimea, but along the entire north-eastern frontier. In fact, Russian troop units are two or three hours of travel from Kiev.’

Former Putin adviser Andrey Illarionov predicted this week that in addition to Crimea, his ex-boss intends to annex other major cities in Ukraine, including Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye, Kherson and Odessa.

Pictures of Russian armoured vehicles on the move in regions close to the Ukrainian border – said to have been taken on Monday – include motorised infantry vehicles and tanks. The military movements are also said to include Grad BM-21 multiple rocket launch vehicles.

The movements come amid Western concerns that the Kremlin is seeking to destabilise other regions in the south and east of Ukraine

Tanks have also been pictured being carried by rail in Belgorod, and are reported to be in a village 12 miles from the border.

The moves come as the Russian armed forces have announced a separate huge military exercise by its airborne troops. The three-day exercise ordered by Putin involves a vast ‘landing operation’ by 4,000 paratroopers.

Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The Russians need to pull back to their bases.’Nato
 has conducted its own show of force to reassure countries in Eastern 
Europe.

The US and Poland began war games on Tuesday that are expected 
to involve at least 12 American F-16 fighter jets. A joint naval 
exercise of US, Bulgarian and Romanian naval forces in the Black Sea 
started on yesterday.

Events are building to a crunch point on Sunday
 when Crimea votes on whether to join Russia. If Putin recognises the 
province as Russian, sanctions will follow.

US Secretary of State 
John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are expected to 
meet in London tomorrow, but British officials remain sceptical that 
Russia will make any concessions.

Two dozen Ukrainians who were injured in Kiev protests have been brought to Germany for medical treatment.

A
 German air force medical evacuation transport touched down Wednesday 
afternoon in Berlin with the patients, who were to be treated in 
hospitals in the capital, and Koblenz and Ulm.

The
 military says the patients were among several hundred injured in 
protests on Independence Square, which became the center and the symbol 
of the anti-government protests in Ukraine.

Lt.
 Col. Matthias Frank told The Associated Press about two-thirds of the 
patients were being treated for gunshot wounds. Two of the patients are 
still in need of intensive care treatment.

Frank says Ukrainian officials asked for help in treating the injured because they had run out of space in Ukrainian hospitals.
