They sell cookies, work for pledges and attend summer camp, but unlike other troops, these Girl Scouts meet behind a razor wire fence.

Two days a month, Girl Scouts are shuttled to a women's correctional facility to spend time with their mothers who have been locked up.

But unlike a normal visit where minimal touching is allowed, girls can cuddle and play with their moms for several hours after they're screened at the prison gates.

The Girl Scouts Beyond Bars began in 1992 as a way to strengthen the bond between girls aged five to 17 and their incarcerated mothers, and break the cycle of crime. 

Now the program operates in several women's facilities across America, and while specific statistics have not been developed to gauge its success, Scout leaders say it's given hope to many imprisoned women.

'It gives daughters a chance to know 
their moms,' Ava-Lisa Macon, a volunteer Scout leader from 
Catonsville, said. 'I see the difference it makes.'

Bonding: Officials say the program has helped women inmates work on their relationships with the children they've left behind, including mother Monnek Hall (left) and her 13-year-old daughter Ayona Hall

The program began as a partnership between the National Institute of Justice and Girl Scouts of Central Maryland.

On February 1, Capital Gazette joined the scout troop's meeting at Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, where it has run for 22 years, documenting the incredible bond between mother and daughter.

Two troops comprising 19 offenders’ 
daughters were shuttled to the Jessup facility to bond with their 
mothers. 

Girls as young as seven walk ed through a metal 
detector and were patted down before being escorted through the electric fence to a gymnasium.

Moms - some in gray moms wore gray sweat suits, others in casual clothes - formed a friendship circle, eagerly awaiting the moment their daughters would run into their arms.

The reunions were incredibly emotional for mother and child.

For 13-year-old Ayona Hall, the simple things like sharing a manicure or spending a day at the movies is what she finds the hardest about her mom being in the slammer.

'I miss special time, like having a girl’s day out,' Ayona said.

Her mom, 32-year-old mom Monnek
 Hall, has been incarcerated since 2008 for assault. She has enrolled in Goucher College courses at the prison to earn a bachelor’s degree in sociology to become a social worker.

'I try to be as real with my daughters as I can because I want for them to learn from this as well,' Hall, who could be released in 2024, told Capital Gazette,.

'I still try to lead by example. I want them to know that everybody makes mistakes. It’s what you do after that.'

To participate, mothers must display exemplary behavior and miss out if they've acted out.

Girl 
Scouts of Central Maryland spokeswoman Danita Terry said the meetings are the only times some of
 the offenders see their daughters.

In a survey last March, 67 percent 
said it was the only time they had with their children.

Although the program is well-regarded, Capital Gazette reported funding has dried up.

The Department of Justice has ceased funding and the Girl Scouts covers the $50,000 annual cost through donations and grants.

Emotional reunion: Although most inmates get to speak with their children on the phone about twice a week, they see them less frequently

Margaret Chippendale, 
acting warden, said she’d like to begin a dads and daughters troop, but the money isn’t available.

Chippendale said she
 approached Boy Scouts of America about a mothers and sons troop about 10 years ago, but 
the group wasn’t interested because of limited resources.

Chippendale wants more people to see the program in action to understand its impact.

She recalled a pregnant inmate who delivered her baby shortly after 
incarceration. Thanks to Girl Scouts, the woman was able to build a relationship with her daughter, and when the girl was old enough, she participated in the troops’ annual 
sleepover.

'It was the first time she had spent the night with her daughter - at nine,' Chippendale said. 'Can you imagine?'
