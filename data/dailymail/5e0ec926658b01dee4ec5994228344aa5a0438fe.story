Google revolutionised the tablet market with its low-cost, high-specification Nexus 7 devices - and if the latest rumours are to be believed, the firm may be hoping to do the same in the mid-sized tablet market.

Potentially quashing recent reports Google was looking to abandon the Nexus project entirely, these new rumours suggest a device called Nexus 8 will launch later this year - and it could be made by HTC.

Google is said to have approached HTC when it originally began building its Nexus range back in 2012, but the Taiwanese firm was too busy with its smartphones so Google is believed to have teamed up with Asus instead.

Reports claim Google is looking to team up with HTC to launch an 8-inch, or even 8.9-inch device, by September. Dubbed Nexus 8, the larger device will form part of the current range that includes the Nexus 7, pictured

If the rumours are true, a Nexus 8 by HTC device is expected to launch by September.

This
would follow Google’s usual pattern of unveiling new devices at its Google 
I/O conference in the summer, and launching them approximately a month 
later. 

The Google conference this year takes place in the last week of June.

The claims were made by sources from Google’s ‘upstream supply chain’ to tech website DigiTimes.

The reports follow claims by IHS Technology in March that a Nexus 8 device will begin production ‘in July or August’ this year.

The source told CNET the gadget is expected to cost $299 (£180) and it would compete with Amazon’s Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 tablet.

If it matches Amazon’s tablet for features, customers can also expect an 8MP rear-facing camera, and a 720p front-facing snapper.

By comparison, the latest Nexus 7 has a 5MP on the rear and a 1.2MP on the front, and costs $229 in the U.S and £199 in the UK.

When the HTC and Google rumours first appeared, it was thought the firms were teaming up to launch a follow-up to Google’s Nexus 10 and this may still be the case.
