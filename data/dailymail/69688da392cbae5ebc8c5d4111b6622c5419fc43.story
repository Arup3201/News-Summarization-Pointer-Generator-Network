Ungraded: Cyrus Hanlon spent hours working after school on his coursework - but it was never sent off

A gifted student has missed out on a major qualification - after a teacher forgot to send his coursework off for marking.

Cyrus Hanlon, from Bury in Greater Manchester, spent his after-school hours working to turn his national award in computing - worth the equivalent of two GCSEs - into a national certificate, worth four.

The 16-year-old dedicated so much free time that he completed the course, which is meant to take two years, in just one.

But he only found out about the blunder when he turned up at Castlebrook High School in Unsworth, Bury, expecting to pick up his award.

Instead, the straight-A student - who hopes to go to Cambridge to study computer science - was told that his ICT teacher had forgotten to send four modules of his work to his examination board, OCR.

Cyrus, who is currently studying A-levels in maths, further maths, physics and computing at Bury College, fears it could a blow to his ambition of getting into Cambridge.

He said: 'My first reaction was to be really annoyed. I had done this course, which is meant to last two years, in one.

'I even went in outside of normal lessons to do the extra work, and it turns out it was for nothing.

'What makes it worse is that I was repeatedly assured that my work would be sent to the board on time.'

All he has to show for it: Cyrus has a letter of commendation from Castlebrook High School, to perhaps show Cambridge University one day

In the past few weeks, Cyrus received 'a
 letter of commendation' from the school admitting he had completed the 
work for the full course.

Mr Anthony Roberts, head teacher at Castlebrook, said: 'Unfortunately, the teacher responsible for submitting Cyrus's work for assessment was absent on a regular basis due to health problems.

'We have given Cyrus a letter confirming the situation should he need to explain this in the future.'

A spokesman for OCR said: 'OCR sympathises with Cyrus and feels the situation is regrettable but would encourage the school to contact us to see if there is a way forward.'

But all he has to show for it is a letter from school 'explaining the situation'
