A mother-of-two was asked by a Marks and Spencer worker why she had mutilated and disfigured herself by decorating her neck and arms with tattoos. 

Natasha Henson, 35, had told the cashier that a customer in the store tutted and commented about her tattoos.

But she did not get the understanding she expected when the woman replied that she was not surprised she had 'tutted' and branded her tattoos 'disgusting.'

Mrs Henson, whose husband is a tattoo artist, left the shop in Bournemouth in tears.

The mother of two was criticised for her tattoos when she asked a cashier in Marks and Spencer about them

She said: 'It was absolutely horrible. 

'It's my choice to have tattoos and I do not expect people to judge me for it.' 

Mrs Henson mentioned being tutted at by a customer to the cashier and got a response she described as 'upsetting and insulting'. 

She said: The woman responded something like, "I am not surprised she tutted I think they are appalling! 

'Why on earth would you want to mutilate and disfigure yourself like that? 

'I don't want to see your tattoos they are disgusting."'

Natasha Henson has received an official apology after she was asked why she had disfigured her body by having tattoos on her neck, legs, arms and chest. A closeup of the tattoos on the 35-year-old's legs shown right

'I then mentioned I had a tattoo shop and she said "It doesn't matter if you have a tattoo shop you don't see painters and decorators go out and cover themselves in paint."'

Mrs Henson said when the woman asked who did the tattoos and she said the majority were done by her husband. 

The woman responded: 'My husband would never hurt me like that"

Mrs Henson said her husband, who runs a tattoo shop, had done the majority of her body art

She also said 'Why would you want to have the pain of them are you weird or something?'

Mrs Henson, whose husband is a tattoo artist based in Bournemouth, left the till in tears and spoke to a manager who took her address and said they would look into the incident. 

She added: 'I feel this is a disgusting way to treat another human being and even worse with it being from someone who is supposed to be using good customer service skills. 

'My son is autistic which is extremely hard work and it is hard enough job as it is without hearing this after a stressful day with him.'  

Mrs Henson said most of her body art has been done by her husband, who runs John Henson Tattoists in Bournemouth and has done so for 31 years. The couple are both members of Bristol Tattoo Club, which was established in 1953 and has strict conditions of entry.

But she said she would not let the incident, which took place in June, put her off having more tattoos in the future.

The cashier is now understood to have quit her job after being told she would face disciplinary action, The Sun reported.

Mrs Henson said she was initially offered a cream tea as an apology by Marks and Spencer but declined the offer and instead the store sent a summer basket to her son's school where they are raising funds for a sensory garden. They also apologised. 

Her 10-year-old son is autistic and attends Springwood campus, a specialist unit at Linwood School, in Bournemouth. Her other son is five.

A spokeswoman for Marks and Spencer said: 'Customer service is extremely important to us. 

'If our high standards are not met, we will do everything we can to resolve it for the customer.' 

Mrs Henson, who works at her husband's shop and volunteers at a wildlife sanctuary, is not the first person to be criticised for  body art.

Keith Gordon, a self confessed tattoo addict, has spent £15,000 having tattoos re-inked all over his body - including on his eyelids. 

He endured hours of painful skin grafts to have previous tattoos removed but has now gone full circle and had them redone - to the dismay of his wife and young family.

Charlotte Tumilty claims she was turned away from her job as a teaching assistant because of her tattoos on her arms, legs and chest, and told to cover up the designs, such as the one on her neck, pictured right 

Last year tattoo artists for Cheryl Fernadez-Versini posted pictures of the latest tattoo inked on the singer 

Miki Lane, of Thirsk, was refused entry into a nightclub in Yorkshire because of her 23 tattoos

Mother-of-two Charlotte Tumilty was turned away on the first day of her new job as a teaching assistant because of her tattoos.

The 26-year-old said she was told the tattoos on her feet, hands and neck were unacceptable because the school is 'strict Catholic'. 

St John Vianney's Primary School in Hartlepool insisted they have asked her only to cover up her tattoos. 

Miss Tumilty, who also has tattoos on her fingers, said this will be almost impossible. 

She was due to work at the school twice a week as part of her placement for the teacher training course she is studying for. 

X Factor judge Cheryl Fernadez-Versini also received a mixed reaction when her tattoo artist revealed the large rose tattoo he had inked on the singer. 

Miki Lane, 23, also claimed she was turned away from a nightclub because of her body art. Miss Lane, of Thirsk in North Yorkshire has 23 tattoos over her body.
