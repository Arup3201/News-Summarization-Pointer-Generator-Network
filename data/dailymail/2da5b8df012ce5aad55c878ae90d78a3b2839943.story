Baby stroller company Graco has recalled close to five million pushchairs due to the risk of fingertip amputation at the hinges.

The recall was officially announced on Thursday by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) after Graco received reports of 11 injuries to children including six fingertip amputations, four partial amputations and one laceration.

The danger, found in 11 models of stroller manufactured in China, was the folding hinge on the sides which can pinch a child’s finger.

The stroller models being recalled were made between August 2000 and September 2014 and named Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling and TravelMate Model Strollers and Travel Systems.

Along with the 4.7 million strollers being recalled in the U.S., around 200,000 in Canada and 10,300 in Mexico are also potentially affected.  

According to the CPSC, stroller owners were asked to contact Graco for a free repair kit which will be available from the start of December.

Until that time, 'caregivers should exercise extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller', the government body advised.

If a stroller begins to fold, the child should be taken out of the stroller immediately, according to the CPSC statement. 

According to ABC, owners are expected to fix the stroller hinges by themselves as it is 'very easy to install'. 

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday.

In July, Graco was caught in another dispute and forced to recall 1.9 million infant car seats, bowing to demands from U.S. safety regulators. 

The recall, the largest for car seats in American history, came after a five-month spat between Graco and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 

Earlier this year the company recalled 4.2 million toddler seats because the harness buckles can get stuck. But it resisted the agency's demand to recall the infant seats.

Buckles can get gummed up by food and drinks, and that could make it hard to remove children. In some cases parents had to cut harnesses to get their kids out. The agency said that increases the risk of injuries in emergencies.
