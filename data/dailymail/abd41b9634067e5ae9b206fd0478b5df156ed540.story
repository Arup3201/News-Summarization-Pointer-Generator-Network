The former fiancee of Jason Collins revealed last night that when the NBA star finally told her he was gay last weekend  before he publicly came out, he did not apologize for lying to her for eight years.

Carolyn Moos' relationship with Collins ended in 2009 when he called off their wedding without a proper explanation, leaving the former WNBA star heartbroken and confused.

Speaking last night to CNN's Piers Morgan she said: 'It's a lot to process at this point. I still have those opportunities and
I still have time to have children and a husband and all those 
wonderful things.

When Morgan asked her if Collins had apologized to her, Carolyn said: 'I think he's in the process of taking ownership of the here and now which is coming out and that can be very overwhelming, I assume'

Watch the full interview only on CNN.

'I did 
invest eight years in our relationship with a shared dream and vision with 
him and I value that. I had to rewrite the script and still am 
rewriting it, it's been very challenging.

'It's going to be a process. It takes a lot of perspective, understanding
and open dialogue at this point.'

When Morgan asked her if Collins had apologized to her when he called last week to deliver the news, Carolyn said: 'I think he's in the process of taking ownership of the here and now 
which is coming out and that can be very overwhelming, I assume.

'Hopefully that will be a natural progression for him to look at things 
from all different angles and as he becomes more comfortable with himself I 
think that time will allow for some perspective on that as well.'

The 6'5" yoga instructor said she was shocked when Collins delivered the news to her and confessed that was the real reason he ended their relationship.

She said last night the news was 'still very fresh in her mind' and is thankful for the close support system she had around her.

Carolyn told TMZ: 'I care about [Jason] tremendously and only want the best for 
him. I want Jason to be happy for a lifetime and stay true to who he 
really is, inside and out.'

Carolyn told TMZ on Tuesday: 'It's very emotional for me as a woman to
have invested eight years in my dream to have a husband, soul mate, and 
best friend in him. So this is all hard to understand.

'I care about [Jason] tremendously and only want the best for 
him. I want Jason to be happy for a lifetime and stay true to who he 
really is, inside and out.'

Carolyn Moos is from Minnesota but currently lives in LA. She is an American model, personal trainer, nutrition consultant and a former collegiate and professional basketball player.

The 34-year-old Stanford graduate runs FITT4Life which promotes nutrition personal training, yoga and overall wellness. She is also a certified personal trainer and is a clothes ambassador for Method Boutique.

Collins said in his first interview since coming out that he has always known he was gay but fought it for years.

In an interview with ABC, he said: 'I always knew I was gay, its like you 
know that the sky is blue but you keep telling yourself it is red.

'I 
fought it for a long time but when you finally get to the point of 
acceptance there is nothing more beautiful. It feels incredible.'

Asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC what message he wants to give young, gay players, he said: 'It doesn’t matter that you’re gay. The key thing is that it’s about basketball.

'It’s about working hard. It’s about sacrificing for your team, it’s all about dedication and that’s what you should focus on.'

Praise
poured in from all over the country yesterday after the 34-year-old 
opened up in an essay for Sports Illustrated - he even got a phone call 
from President Obama, who was 'incredibly supportive'.

'I
just try to live an honest, genuine life and next thing you know you 
have the president calling you,' he said. 'He was incredibly supportive 
and was proud of me and said that this not only affected my life but 
others going forward.'

He added: 'I think the country is ready to support 
an openly gay basketball player. I'm trying to rewrite the gay 
stereotype and let everyone know that you can't put people in a box.'

Team owners, managers and sports writers have long questioned how athletes and fans would react to a teammate announcing publicly that he is homosexual.

However the response to Collins' announcement on Monday was overwhelmingly positive from his former teammates and leading figures in basketball and other major sports.

The former Washington Wizards and Boston Celtics star revealed that tennis player Martina Navratilova has always been his role model and he hopes that he can be the same to others.

He revealed he first came out to his aunt - who said she always knew - even though his twin brother did not even realize it. 'I'm really good at playing it straight', he joked.

Asked what he wants from his teammates he said: 'I want support, because that's what I would give to them. The team is like a family and the NBA is like a brotherhood. We support each other on the team.
