Every time I say I believe in God, people look a bit embarrassed. It’s become one of those subjects most people don’t want to discuss.

We can talk face-to-face and chat online about our sex lives, our children and our fantasy partners, but we hesitate to reveal whether we believe in life after death.

At Easter, the most important religious festival for Christians, politicians go through hoops to avoid talk of the G (God) word, for fear of alienating voters.

Although Ed Miliband (left) has been visiting relatives in Israel, he calls himself a Jewish atheist. Janet Street-Porter believes it is refreshing to hear David Cameron (right)  admit he uses the Church as a support system

Ed Miliband, who has been visiting relatives in Israel, says he hopes to become the first Jewish prime minister. He was born into a Jewish family, but says he doesn’t believe in God — calling himself a Jewish atheist.

I struggle with that; it’s religion-lite. How do other Jews feel about someone who is Jewish, but doesn’t believe in God? Isn’t it a bit of a pick ’n’ mix approach to fundamentals?

I imagine some are highly offended. Nick Clegg says he doesn’t believe in God, but his three sons are being brought up as Catholics to please his wife.

Cleggers seems wet, as usual — I suspect he’s an atheist because he (mistakenly) believes it will offend the least number of people.

But, whether you are a Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim or Anglican, you believe in something, a higher power. Clegg has made the wrong call.

Tony Blair also brought up his children as Catholics to please Cherie, and made quite a show of his spirituality whenever I went to interview him.

Since leaving office he has attended Mass regularly, but hasn’t commented on his faith since Alastair Campbell once famously remarked that ‘we don’t do God’.

Refreshingly, David Cameron recently admitted he turns to the Church for support in difficult times — most notably after his son Ivan’s sad death.  Cameron says he finds ‘a little bit of peace and hopefully a little bit of guidance’ when he attends Holy Communion at the church attached to his children’s Church of England school.

Cameron doesn’t flaunt his beliefs — he’s a typical, slightly embarrassed Anglican, who turns up in church at feasts and festivals and only prays when the proverbial has hit the fan. There’s nothing wrong in that.

I’m just pleased that Cameron, who regularly attends state events with leaders of the Anglican Church and the Royal Family, isn’t one of the two-faced cynics in government and is happy to say he believes in God.

In our modern world of sneerers, that takes a lot  of guts.

Janet Street-Porter could not resist a quick snap by this funny sign

I’ve just started filming a new BBC1 series about food with lovely chef Brian Turner. Last week we were in Rye, where our hotel was of the Basil Fawlty variety.

I asked for an extra light for my dimly lit room — it never arrived. I asked for plain yoghurt — they didn’t have any. When we went for breakfast at 7.30am they were still putting out the buffet and there was no one to take our order. The walls were so thin I could hear a couple sneezing next door and someone going to the loo upstairs.

Luckily, the countryside  is divine and I couldn’t resist a quick snap by this sign: please don’t send in your comments! I resisted the urge to paint out the letters ‘WO’.

Sat Navs irritate me, it doesn’t matter which voice I set, patronising female or prissy bloke.

It’s the way they repeat instructions over and over, as if the driver is utterly dumb — I’ve even started talking to my partner like a sat nav, repeating all instructions (ie orders), such as ‘take the rubbish out’, three times.

Now, inventors in India have developed sat nav shoes — which come with an app that can be downloaded to a smartphone.

Not impressed: Inventors in India have developed sat nav shoes

Using a Bluetooth link to communicate with the phone-mapping system, the shoes emit a buzz if you go in the wrong direction. They can even be programmed to monitor how many calories you’re burning, like my Fitbit, which is ‘resting’ on a shelf because I don’t want to fail at more than one thing a day.

Maps are the joy of my life — I have collected hundreds over the years, and the last thing I need is a clever shoe.

Sadly, map sales have plummeted by 40 per cent  thanks to sat navs, and in  future Ordnance Survey will only print some on demand.

GPS devices don’t make  for enjoyable walking —  why spend your time staring at a screen when you can read a map and then pop it in your pocket?

When I started presenting telly shows in 1975, the studio complexes had bars that were open all day and people drank vast amounts. I don’t know how any work got done after 3pm.

Now, it’s very different. Working in a TV studio is like going into a factory. The bars have closed.

People grab a sandwich, dressing rooms get used for two or three different shows a day. The only time you might get a glass of cheap wine is after recording has finished around 10pm. Back in the Seventies, filming on location, we stopped for a proper lunch; now, we grab something quick on the go as budgets have been slashed and working  days extended.

Cleared: Nigel Evans

This has been my experience of the past 40 years, so I was nauseated to read about what goes on in Westminster — researchers and MPs groping and getting sloshed night after night. It sounds as if they are living in a time warp. Former Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, cleared of sex allegations, now says he was ‘drunk from time to time . . . but not plastered every night’.

Even so, I’d like to know why taxpayers are subsidising bars and canteens in Westminster. I’d close half the bars for good, shut the rest during the day and charge premium prices.

As for canteens, most of us get a quick lunch at M&S, Pret or Greggs. Why should MPs be any different? 

Fern Britton (pictured) is hosting the new BBC follow-up to Bake Off: The Great Allotment Challenge

The sun came out at the weekend, so I succumbed to garden centre impulse purchasing.

You know the story — a trip to get one ‘essential’ (cleaner to remove the green slime brought on by the wet winter from the patio) ends up with me pushing a trolley full of plants and a bill for £83. How did that happen?

Tomorrow sees the start of National Gardening Week, with events taking place up and down the country, from Woking to Wrexham, Harrogate to Handcross. Experts are on call to answer queries and before next Friday I am bound to be back at another garden centre buying even more plants.

Tomorrow, the BBC is kicking off its much-publicised follow-up to Bake Off, the Great Allotment Challenge, hosted by Fern Britton, with a judging panel including the Queen’s former head gardener.

I come from a family  of vegetable growers: my paternal grandfather and father spent every free hour digging, nurturing rows of potatoes, leeks, wonderful  lettuces and carrots, probably as a way to escape their carping wives.

I’ve already planted out some broad beans on my  plot in Yorkshire, as well as cabbages, leeks, lettuces  and onions. Baby beetroot plants are on stand-by in the cold frame.

It could hail or snow right up to early May and I could lose the lot, but that’s the risk we brave gardeners are prepared to take to get ahead. If the temperature drops, I shall be swaddling the plants in fleece and polythene, and telling them to buck up.

It’s weird the BBC are launching this show when we are eating less fruit and veg than ever — on average, just 3.9 portions out of our recommended five a day.

Meanwhile, some experts think five is not enough, claiming we really need seven or even ten. I think Fern will be presiding over the green  fingers equivalent of cookery porn: we’ll be salivating  over the marrows and aubergines, but how many viewers will eat them, let alone  grow them from scratch? Very few.
