A £30 million art gift which includes Tracey Emin's controversial unmade bed, has been snubbed by the nation.

The Tate Modern said no thanks to the offer from advertising guru Charles Saatchi who donated the best of his private collection for free two years ago.

And although the Government welcomed the move, the Arts Council turned the collection down because they wanted to 'pick and choose' pieces.

Saatchi's bequest in which he promised to cover future costs of storage, insurance, maintenance and restoration, has more than 200 works by several of the world’s leading contemporary artists.

Valuable: A ceramic urn by Grayson Perry

These include ceramic urns by Grayson Perry, Zhang Dali's Chinese Offspring featuring life-size naked figures strung up by their feet and Ghost by the Algerian artist Kader Attia, consisting of hundreds of praying figures made from aluminium foil.

Emin's bed - nominated for a Turner prize and exhibited at The Tate - consisted of items from the artist's room (such as condoms and a pair of knickers with stains), while other detritus, included a pair of slippers.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked Saatchi for his 'incredible generosity' describing the collection as being of huge international importance.

Mr Hunt said: ' This is an outstanding example of how 
Britain can benefit from individual acts of social responsibility.'

But the offer unravelled when the Government-funded Arts Council, which looks after 7,000 
modern and contemporary works for the nation, asked to select some pieces and not others.

Saatchi then withdraw the offer. His spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Things didn’t work out with the Arts 
Council because they wanted to pick and choose from the gift, which we 
felt was a bit rude.

'Charles is still keen to make this gift to the 
nation.'

An Arts Council 
spokesman said: 'We discussed all 
aspects of the proposals with the [Saatchi] gallery’s management to find
a way of realising his ambitions, however no firm decision on the issue
was reached.'

Donation: Charles Saatchi

Saatchi, 69, married to the cookery writer and broadcaster Nigella Lawson, has had several offers from abroad to exhibit the collection, but wants to keep it in this country.

He has suggested it could be lent to museums, ministerial offices and galleries around the country, and as a bonus, the gift would include other pieces that could be sold to buy new acquisitions.

The offer was rejected by the Tate Modern's director Sir Nicholas Serota. Saatchi once describing the museum's Turner Prize as 'pseudo-controversial rehashed claptrap'.

A spokesman for the Tate was quoted in the Telegraph as saying: 'Charles sent Nick the list [of works] but as Charles was in discussions with others, we didn’t intervene.'

Much of the collection, described by artist Perry as the 'cream of the crop', has been displayed in  Saatchi galleries, including its current base in the former Duke of York’s barracks in Chelsea.

He is understood to be 'extremely disappointed' that the collection’s future remains in doubt.
