It was a case of life emulating art for British actress Linda Bassett, when she stripped off for a charity calendar - a decade after starring in smash hit film Calendar Girls.

The award winning film told the true story of a group of Women's Institute members who posed naked to raise funds for Leukaemia Research.

Now Ms Bassett, who played Cora in the film, has posed naked for a real charity calendar which was put together to support a dog rescue charity.

Linda braved a naked calendar shoot for the month of October again - with her pet dog Dust

The 64-year-old bravely agreed to undress after adopting her own pet pooch from Safe Dog Rescue.

It is the first time Ms Bassett has stripped for charity - despite the success of Calendar Girls sparking a craze for nude calendars in support of good causes.

Nevertheless, Ms Bassett said her experience of playing Cora did help during the shoot, which saw her strike a pose alongside her dog, Dust.

Ms Bassett adopted her 12-year-old Collie cross  after he was found injured and starving to death in a sewage pipe in Romania by Safe Dog Rescue.

 'Appearing in Calendar Girls was I thought the first and last time I would pose naked for a calendar but it appears not,' explained Ms Bassett.

'I'm quite a bit older now than I was when we filmed Calendar Girls so you could say it was a brave move but I was more than happy to help such a fantastic charity. 

'In fact on the day of the shoot I was probably the least nervous because of my past experience in the film and I was able to reassure the other women who either work for the charity or have adopted dogs, who were understandably a bit anxious. 

'But of course we all had our dogs there with us and they were the real stars of the show. You would think getting 12 Romanian street dogs to pose might be tricky but they were wonderful and it just goes to show what beautiful animals they are.'

The charity Ms Bassett posed for helps injured and abandoned dogs from the UK and Romania and recently hit the headlines after raising £3000 for a set of bionic paws for a dog that had undergone a double amputation in Romania.

The actress adopted her dog Dust 18 months ago, and finally realised her life long ambition of becoming a dog owner.

'I have always loved dogs and always wanted a dog but as an actress it can be tricky to juggle time and commitments,' she added.

'But I decided I just couldn't wait a minute longer and looked into re- homing an older animal because they are always the hardest to home.'

She had read about Dust on the Safe Rescue website and says she knew instantly he was the one for her.

'When I read what Dust had been through, I just felt strongly he was the one so I phoned Safe Rescue and asked if I could come and meet him.

'I went that day and fell in love with Dust straight away but of course the charity wanted to give me the once over before they agreed I could take him.' 

Since the adoption Miss Bassett has become a firm supporter of Safe Rescue For Dogs - but admits she had to think twice when she was asked to strip naked again.

'Who wouldn't at my age?', she admitted. 'But in all honesty I actually felt very relaxed on the day and we all had a good giggle.'

Kelly Hare, who set up the charity and came up with the idea, said: 'We are always looking for new fundraising ideas and a calendar had been on the horizon for some time but it wasn't until we started planning it that I remember that we had an original Calendar Girl in our midst. 

'I knew it was very cheeky to ask Linda if she might strip naked and be in our calendar but if you don't ask you don't get and to my utter delight she agreed.'

The images were shot on a chilly morning at a farm near Great Yarmouth last month. 'I think anyone passing might have got a shock if they looked over to see the actress Linda Bassett naked in a field with her dog,' added Miss Bassett.

'She is a real superstar because not only is she a great actress, but a warm and kind human being who wants to help others. We can't thank her enough for her support.'

But of course the real stars of the show are the dogs who have survived injury, attack and sickness to find new loving homes in the UK.
