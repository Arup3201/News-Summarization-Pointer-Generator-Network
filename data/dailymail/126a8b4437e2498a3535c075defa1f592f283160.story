A former leader of the Black Panthers has been released from prison more than four decades after being convicted of killing a Baltimore police officer.

Marshall 'Eddie' Conway, 67, was freed from the prison in Jessup, Maryland on Tuesday. The decision came after state prosecutors agreed to change his life sentence to time served and probation.

Conway is one of dozens of inmates who have been released after Maryland's Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that judges had given improper instructions to juries before 1980.

Conway was convicted in 1971 of fatally shooting 35-year-old Donald Sager as Sager and another officer sat in a marked patrol car in April 1970.

Conway has always denied any participation in the attack, citing the lack of hard evidence in his conviction that was reliant on testimonies of former Black Panthers associate Jack Ivory Johnson, jailhouse informant Charles Reynolds, and Officer Roger Nolan.

The Black Panther Party was originally formed in 1966 to protect black neighborhoods from police infringing on their rights.

The group strove to empower black communities politically and socially, but was often associated with violence and political discourse.

The original Black Panther members were Elbert "Big Man" Howard, Huey P. Newton, Sherwin Forte, Bobby Seale,  Little Bobby Hutton, and Reggie Forte.

The Black Panther Party expanded to chapters in major cities such as  Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, and New York. At the height of the Panthers' notoriety, membership is believed to have peaked at nearly 10,000.

The party all but dissolved in 1982 amidst philosophical differences and legal issues.

Nolan claimed he had exchanged gunfire with Conway at the time of Sager's slaying.

Over the years, Conway received support from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and local officials.

While in prison, Conway founded the Friend of a Friend mentoring program put in place in a number of Maryland prisons to help mentor inmates.

Morgan State University even opened the Eddie Conway Liberation Institute last year for students to learn about policy debate while he was still incarcerated.

Not everyone is for Conway's early release, most notably Sager's family and police union officials.

David Sager, son of the fallen officer, told The Baltimore Sun: 'He rolled over,' in reference to Baltimore's State Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein.

'He didn't up put a fight. I can't stress it enough. Today is a dark day.'

At the time of Conway's arrest, he officially served the Baltimore Black Panthers as the Minister of Defense and had suspicions that the group had undercover National Security Agency officials spying on him.
