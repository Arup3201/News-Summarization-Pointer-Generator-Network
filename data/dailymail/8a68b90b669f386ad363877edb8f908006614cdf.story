Back in court: Former Army captain Brian Witty, 42, is accused of raping three women who came forward after hearing he had been convicted of other rapes

A notorious serial rapist who was jailed last year has denied the rape of three other women who came forward after his highly-publicised trial.

Former Territorial Army captain Brian Witty, 42, is accused of raping the women when they were all 19 year-old students.

One of his alleged victims claims he raped her and then left with a smug look on his face as though something funny had happened.

Prosecutor Edmund Gritt told Kingston Crown Court: 'They describe him as somebody who is charming, confident on the verge of arrogance, violent and takes sex by force, using his physical strength if he is refused.'

The jury were told City banker Witty, who served in the Parachute Regiment, had previously been convicted at the same court of three rapes and one sexual assault of four victims last year.

They were told the media coverage of the trial prompted three new alleged victims to come forward after years of silence.

Witty, of Twickenham Road, Teddington, has pleaded not guilty to raping the women.

He is accused of raping one of the complainants, who is now a 43 year-old dentist, at her Liverpool University hall of residence room in September or October in 1989.

Witty is alleged to have raped the second victim, now a 35 year-old nurse, at a Hull address in in December, 1997.

The third alleged victim, who is now a doctor aged 35, claims she was raped by Witty at his former Kensington flat in the early hours of New Year's Day in 1998.

Historical: The City financier is accused of raping the women when they were 19-year-old students

The court heard Witty knew the first 
woman, who he met at Hull College of Further Education where she was 
retaking her A-levels, and became angry when she stood him up in 
Liverpool where she had moved to study dentistry.

'Her first impression was that he was charming, fun and engaging, but also cocky and very confident,' explained Mr Gritt. 'She soon discovered that Mr. Witty's personality had a different side that was intimidating, jealous and violent.'

A witness once saw Witty twisting the student's arm until she said sorry to him for a joke he was offended by. The court heard he also beat her and parked outside her family's home in Hull to intimidate them.

After she moved to Liverpool he tracked her down and turned up at her lodgings.

'She was terrified, he held the door 
open, punched her and forced her back into the room,' said Mr Gritt. 'He
punched her repeatedly all over and she curled herself into a ball to 
protect herself.

Previous: The court was told Witty had committed a rape before the alleged offences he is currently being tried for - and was 'confident' after being released by police without charge

'He sat on top of her, holding her down, and at one point put his hands around her neck.

'He pulled down her lower clothing and raped her. He was very strong and she was very frightened.

'Afterwards he started punching her again and she began screaming. The defendant continued shouting and hitting her and was enraged that she did not meet up with him.'

She was left with a bleeding eye and lip and with bruising to her face and body, but only told people Witty had beaten her up.

The jury were told the second victim 
was staying overnight on a living-room sofa at an address in Hull where 
Witty and a couple were also staying at.

Violent: The court heard Brian Witty initially came across as charming but then became jealous and violent

'There in the small hours she was woken 
by this defendant, pulling her to the floor and he held her down and put
his hand over her mouth,' said Mr Gritt.

'He was much stronger and she was frozen with fear and this defendant then raped her.

'He said nothing, but simply looked smug and he stood up with a smirk on his face as if something funny had just happened.'

Again the victim did not report the rape and the jury were reminded Witty had raped before this date and was 'confident' after being released without charge when arrested and questioned by police.

Days later, Witty was celebrating the new year in London and agreed to look after a medical student, who was attending Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, and could not get back home to Romford, Essex.

'Her friend fatefully introduced her to Mr Witty as somebody who would look after her and eliminate the risk of her getting raped on the way home.

'The defendant reassured her that he did not have any ulterior motive, but sex was all that was on his mind and she thought he was the perfect gentleman.'

The jury were told his Kensington flat had been the scene of a previous rape where Witty had again attacked a lone female once he got her inside.

'He pushed her face-down on the bed, holding her arms above her, spread her legs and raped her,' said Mr Gritt. 'She was shocked and scared and did not know what to do.'

The young woman told her tutor, doctor and friends about the rape and they noticed bruising to both her arms, the court heard, but again the police were not informed.

Like the other two complainants, she only went to the police after learning of Witty's convictions.

The trial continues.
