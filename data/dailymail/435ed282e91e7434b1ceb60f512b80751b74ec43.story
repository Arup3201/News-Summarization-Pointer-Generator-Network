Disgraced former officer Christopher Dorner stalked the Los Angeles police chief's 88-year-old father and made plans to kill his pet dog before going on a rampage that left four people dead.

Police Chief Charlie Beck said that unpublished notes Dorner made in his manifesto reveal he had targeted Becks' own family, and even knew the layout of his father's home.

Ex-LAPD officer Dorner went on a vengeance-fueled rampage in southern California in February 2013, as he pursued a vendetta against his former police colleagues and their families.

Christopher Dorner went on a vengeance-fueled rampage in southern California in February 2013, as he pursued a vendetta against his former police colleagues and their families

'With my dad, he knew the layout of the house in general,' Chief Beck told NBC News. 'He knew about my dad's dog and he made plans to dispatch the dog, to kill the dog. He had spent a lot of time trying to find a victim to get at.'

Dorner is known to have tailed Monica Quan, the daughter of an ex-LAPD captain, before shooting her dead, and he had also shadowed the family of LAPD Captain Phil Tingirides, who was on the disciplinary board that dismissed him.

In the manifesto he posted online as the rampage began, Dorner wrote about targeting the Tingirides family: 'I know your route to and from your home, and your division. I know your significant other's routine, your children's best friends and recess.'

'All of us who put on the uniform … we know that we are at risk,' Chief Beck said. 'But all of us expect our families to be to be safe. One of the reasons we do this is to keep our families safe. I think that was the horror of what Dorner was capable of.'

The killings sparked a nine-day manhunt, before Dorner was cornered and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his mountain hideout

Ms Quan, 28, and her fiance Keith Lawrence, 27, were found dead in their car outside their condo, and an LAPD officer had also been shot in cold blood.

The killings sparked a nine-day manhunt, before Dorner was cornered and  died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his mountain hideout.

Three further police personnel were shot and wounded while he was on the loose, and another died in the final siege at the ski resort of Big Bear.

In a rambling 6,000-word manifesto he posted online, Dorner vented his rage about the decision made to dismiss him, and made accusations that racism remained rife in the police force

During the manhunt, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa coordinated a $1 million reward from more than 30 agencies or corporations, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Los Angeles Dodgers, AEG and the University of Southern California. 

It is believed Dorner carried out the attack as revenge after he was dismissed from the LAPD on a charge of making false statements in 2008.

In the rambling 6,000-word manifesto he posted online, he vented his rage about the decision made  to dismiss him, and made accusations that racism remained rife in the police force. 

In it he promises to wage 'unconventional and asymmetrical warfare' against police as revenge for his 'unjust' treatment by the 'corrupt' department. It led the police to place about 50 officers and their families under protection.
