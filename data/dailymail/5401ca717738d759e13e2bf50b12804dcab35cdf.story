A brave effort from Celtic especially after Virgil van Dijk's early dismissal. Celtic had their chances but Inter did what was required with Fredy Guarin's late wonder strike finishing the job.

Celtic may be out of Europe but they will have little time to rest on their laurels as they face Aberdeen in a top-of-the-table clash in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday. 

Gordon has been heroic all night but there was no chance of him getting a hand to that. Guarin unleashes a rasping shot from outside the box into the left corner and that will be that for Celtic. Inter were all set to go through but Guarin's shot is the icing on the cake.

That wasn't too far off from the substitute. The contest has really slowed down and tightened up in the last 20 minutes of so. Inter look happy to see this out but are living dangerously. 

Final throw of the dice by Ronny Deila with the introduction of Kris Commons. Now they just need a free-kick 20 or so yards out...

Can the Celtic midfielder make a difference late on in this contest? 

Inter are looking more and more frustrated here. Heading into the final quarter, Inter are going through as things stand but Ronny Deila's men are still in this and are looking dangerous on the break.

That's the first thing Gordon's done wrong all night. The Celtic keeper is booked for time wasting from the kick out. Bit of a harsh call.

The Inter midfielder takes a theatric tumble in the box after a challenge Izaguirre but it was never going to be a penalty. 

John Guidetti was becoming increasingly frustrated up front. His replacement by James Forrest leaves Celtic without a recognised striker but with the chance to try and use the Scotland international's pace through the middle. 

The Swedish striker doesn't look too pleased to be taken off but it's been a tough hour for the Celtic forward. 

The Argentie is put through on goal but Gordon pulls off another point-blank save to keep Celtic in the contest. They'll be calling him Gandalf Gordon by the end of the night if he keeps this up!

Hernanes unleashes a powerful curling shot from outside the box but Gordon sees it nice and early and gets down to parry the shot away. The Celtic keeper is having quite the night in goal. 

Izaguirre fires a long pas which splits the Inter defence and Guidetti looked clean through there but the Celtic frontman is called back for offside. The action doesn't stop there though as that man Palacio wastes a great chance as he blazes his shot high over Craig Gordon into the San Siro stands. 

Massive 45 minutes ahead for 10-man Celtic. 

Celtic will have been thankful for the half-time whistle. Virgil van Dijk's red card leaves Ronny Deila's side with it all to do in the second half. 0-0 as we break for half-time. As things stand, Inter will go through on away goals. 

Heroic stuff from Craig Gordon in goal as he pulls off two incredible point-blank saves. The Celtic keeper has single-handedly kept his side in the contest in the last 10 minutes. Van Dijk' sending off has had a huge effect on the contest. The momentum has definitely swung towards Inter as we approach half-time. 

Mauro Icardi ensured referee Ivan Kruzliak wouldn't forgot to show Van Dijk a second yellow as he waved an imaginary card. Two soft, but needless, bookings. Mackay-Steven sacrificed to bring Efe Ambrose into action. Titanic task for Celtic now.

Mauro Icardi beats Van Dijk for pace down the left wing and the Celtic defender pulls the Inter player's shirt. Silly play. A second yellow card soon follows and Celtic are down to 10-men.

Hernanes swings in the free kick and Gordon makes a superb save to deny Icardi in the box. 

Emilio Izaguirre looking vulnerable when Inter attack down their right. The Honduran left-back has been pretty poor in his distribution and positioning. Celtic otherwise pretty composed. 

Virgil van Dijk catches Palacio from behind and follows through. The Celtic defender got plenty of the ball but the Argentine takes a right tumble. Van Dijk is booked and will miss Celtic's next game in Europe - should they progress tonight..

Ronny Deila will be delighted with his side's workrate so far. The visitors are pressing high up the pitch and giving Inter no time on the ball. 

Inter have plenty of possession but have created very little so far. 

Stefan Johansen leading Celtic's pressing game with typically high energy levels. The Norwegian midfielder also helping to stretch the Inter defence with some clever runs. A very open game so far.

Stuart Armstrong gets goal side of Santon and goes down in a heap in the Inter box, but play is waved on by the referee. Armstrong is furious. No doubt there was contact from Santon but Armstrong's antics didn't help his cause. Promising play from Celtic so far. 

Mackay-Steven shows good pace down the right but is brought down by D'Ambrosio. 

Medel, Shaqiri and Icardi are looking dangerous in midfield but Celtic are containing the trio thus far..

Gary Mackay-Steven is put clean through on goal but Inter keeper Carrizo stays big to deny the Celtic forward. 

The game has sparked into life with Palacio unleashing a long-range shot but Craig Gordon is alive to the danger. Nice open feel to the game so far. 

Adam Matthews was down getting treatment but the Celtic centre back is up and running again. Would have been a huge early blow for the visitors Matthews was forced off. 

Inter get the actin going in Milan 

The teams are in the tunnel, kick-off is next 

Leigh Griffiths is limping around the San Siro pitch after being injured in training last night. His replacement by John Guidetti is the one Celtic change from the first leg.

Inter Milan XI: Carrizo; D'Ambrosio, Ranocchia, Juan Jesus, Santon; Guarin, Medel, Hernanes; Shaqiri; Icardi, Palacio 

Subs: Handanovic, Kovacic, Campagnaro, Vidic, Kuzmanovic, Obi, Puscas

Good evening and welcome to Sportmail's live coverage of Celtic's crunch second leg Europa League clash against Inter Milan at the San Siro.

A late Fredy Guarin goal in the 88th minute sent Inter Milan through to the last 16 of the Europa League and sent 10-man Celtic out of the competition after a valiant display at the San Siro.

Guarin struck from outside the area to give Roberto Mancini's side a 1-0 win on Thursday.

Defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off for Celtic after only 36 minutes for two bookable offences.

Going down to 10 men made it harder for Ronny Deila's side to commit men into attack, having conceded three away goals in the 3-3 first leg draw last week. But they produced a valiant display until Guarin lashed in two minutes from time.
