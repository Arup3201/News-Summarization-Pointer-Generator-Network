David Gilmour: 'What I teach is guys'

A literature professor has caused outrage because he refuses to teach his university students works by women authors.

Award-winning author David Gilmour said he doesn't love women writers enough to teach them, adding 'What I teach is guys'.

His comments, made in a Random House interview, have caused backlash, with critics accusing him of hating women.

However, the author of A Perfect Night to go to China, says if his students want to learn about women authors they should join another class, Gawker reported.

He said students who wanted to read women authors, such as Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood, should go down the hall where 'there are people who teach women writers much, much better than I can'.

Mr Gilmour, who teaches classes at University of Toronto's Victoria College, said: 'Usually at the beginning of the semester a
hand shoots up and someone asks why there aren’t any women writers in 
the course.'

However, far from disregarding works by women, Mr Gilmour says the reason he doesn't teach them is because he isn't passionate enough about their work.

'When I was given this job I said I would only teach the people that I truly, truly love. Unfortunately, none of those happen to be Chinese, or women,' he told Random House.

The only concession on his course is Virginia Woolf, but Mr Gilmour, a former CBC presenter, says even his third-year students struggle to understand the Modernist author.

Mostly though, the professor focuses on 'guys. Serious hetrosexual guys', such as Fitzgerald and Checkhov.

With a focus on mostly Russian and American modern short fiction, he added: 'I can only teach stuff I love. I can’t teach stuff that I don’t.'

Make the grade: Virginia Woolf, right, is included in the course that mainly includes writers such as Fitzgerald

As well as women and Chinese writers, he added that he had not yet found inspiring works by any Canadian writers.

The remarks led to backlash on Twitter, with a barrage of commentators showing their distaste for his exclusion of women writers.

Mr Gilmour however, brushed off the controversy, saying his remarks had been taken out of context.

'I was careless with my words,' he told the Toronto Sun. 'I said them in a such a way that they could be interpreted to be disparaging, dismissive.'

He added that he had been talking French with a colleague at the time of the interview, which he blamed for distracting him from giving his interviewer his full attention.

And, according to The Atlantic, Mr Gilmour claims most of his students are young women, and that he teaches authors of questionable sexuality, which he argued counteracts claims that he only likes macho men.

'I think anybody who teaches Truman Capote cannot be attacked for being an anti-anything.' he said.

He added: 'I want to apologize to the people who ended up feeling like that after reading my words.'

A University of Toronto statement said: 'Neither Victoria College nor the University of Toronto endorses the views attributed to David Gilmour in the article.'

It added that the 'noted Canadian author and journalist, teaches elective seminars on his area of expertise, leaving other areas of literature to be taught by colleagues who can do so most effectively based on their areas of specialization.'
