Sky’s customers will now be forced to ‘opt in’ if they want to access adult material – protecting children from stumbling across hardcore images and videos

Sky has pledged to impose an automatic block on pornographic websites in a major victory for online safety campaigners and the Daily Mail.

Under the move, a family-friendly filter will be set by default unless customers specifically ask for it to be removed.

Sky’s five million clients will now be forced to ‘opt in’ if they want to access adult material – protecting children from stumbling across hardcore images and videos.

New broadband users will have the blocker installed already.

Sky becomes the first major company to take the step, which was welcomed by child safety experts last night.

But pressure is now mounting on other major internet providers such as BT – which has twice as many broadband customers as Sky – and Virgin Media to adopt the same ‘family-friendly’ approach.

At present, these companies give customers the option of a filter – but do not impose one automatically.

The Daily Mail has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn to protect children, with the over-18s forced to undergo a strict age verification check before they can access adult material.

In 2013, David Cameron warned that easy access to web porn was ‘corroding childhood’, and announced that he had reached agreement with internet firms to make it easier for worried parents to impose a filter.

BT, Virgin, TalkTalk and Sky agreed to contact customers by the end of last year to present them with an on-screen choice about family-friendly filters. 

While campaigners welcomed the move, some were concerned it was too easy for families to ignore filters, putting children at risk of stumbling across hardcore imagery.

Shield of protection: How the new system will work - new customers will have blocker installed automatically

Sky has now gone much further with an automatic filter known as Broadband Shield, which it calls a ‘family-friendly approach’ to using the internet. 

Starting this week, the company will email its 5million customers about the blocker.

If households ignore the email and a subsequent reminder, their computer will automatically block pornography and other websites considered to be harmful to children. 

Director Lyssa McGowan said: ‘It’s better for people to make their own choice, but until they do, we believe this process will be the safest one.’ Many campaign groups supported the move last night.

John Carr, director of The UK Council for Child Internet Safety, said: ‘Sky has raised the bar and it will be interesting to see how the other companies react to this.’

Charities including the NSPCC, ChildNet International and the Churches’ Child Protection Advisory Service also praised the measure. 

But Jim Killock, of online freedom campaigners the Open Rights Group, said customers need to understand the implications of filters before deciding whether they want them.

Ed Macnair, of online security firm CensorNet, said the blanket ban is not enough – parents also need to take responsibility for what children see on all devices.

A spokesman for BT said it was sending existing broadband customers a browser message about setting up free parental controls.

Virgin Media said its 4.5million customers are told of filters via marketing, but it remains off if they ignore it. A spokesman said: ‘We believe people should have the tools and advice to make the decisions that are right for them.’

TalkTalk, which has four million internet customers, also gives users a choice where the parental control filter is pre-selected as ‘on’.

Ed Vaizey, minister for the digital economy, said: ‘This is exactly the sort of responsible approach we want internet service providers to take. Government will continue to work with ISPs to ensure we continue to help parents protect their children from harmful content online.’
