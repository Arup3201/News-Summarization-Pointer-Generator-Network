Speaking out: Four years into his premiership, Mr Cameron has spoken for the first time about his darkest moments, distant memories and preference for trash TV

It is an issue which can bring even the happiest couple close to blows: who controls the television remote control.

And it is no different when David Cameron and his wife Samantha sit down in front of the box in their Downing Street flat.

He has revealed that he does what millions of men do: grabs hold of the remote and channel hops from one ‘rubbish’ programme to another.

And Mrs Cameron does what millions of women married to such men do: stomps off in exasperation.

In one of his most candid and intimate interviews since becoming Prime Minister, Mr Cameron has told The Mail on Sunday that:

In the interview with Mail on Sunday Editor Geordie Greig, Mr Cameron confesses to the ‘annoying male habit of channel-surfing’ on the TV. ‘I watch a lot of rubbish,’ he admits.

‘I love murder mysteries and things like that on a Sunday night to escape from it all.’

Asked who controls the remote, him or Samantha, he pleaded guilty: ‘I drive her mad because I sometimes watch more than one thing at a time, and then she’ll leave the room.’

However, Mr Cameron is rather more strict when it comes to what his three children, Nancy, six, Elwen, seven and Florence, three, do for entertainment.

Off duty: The Prime Minister with his family including Ivan, left, who died in 2009. Mr Cameron blasts those who try to search for a 'silver lining' to the tragedy that shook his family in the year before the last election

They are banned from having video games, mobile phones or tablets (though they are allowed to use their parents’ iPads ‘from time to time’) and on weekend mornings are banned from watching TV.

‘I try to get them away from the Disney channels to watch nature programmes,’ he said. ‘We try to limit screen time. We have rules. At the weekend: no television in the morning. We don’t do morning TV – they should be doing something.’

The rules seem to be working. He says Elwen ‘plays a lot of football and rugby’ and had tried his hand at DJing at a friend’s party, while Nancy was taking part in ‘an amateur opera.’

Similarly, traditionalist Mr Cameron has avoided telling them about ‘twerking,’ the provocative dance made famous by pop star Miley Cyrus, who previously starred in the children’s TV series Hannah Montana.

Traditionalist: Mr Cameron revealed he refuses to give his children mobile phones or music and video gaming devices. He will also try his best to keep them from discovering what 'twerking' means

‘My children are too young. Luckily they haven’t connected this lovely Hannah Montana, who is now this person twerking.’

But
 he may be fighting a losing battle: they have already noticed swearing 
in pop songs.

‘They say, “Daddy, that’s the bad this or that word.” They
 are very conscious of that and they don’t approve of swearing.

‘They are quite right – the artists are wrong to swear, although I can’t say I totally live by those rules myself.’

The Prime Minister reflects more sombrely on the deaths of his father Donald in 2010 and his disabled son Ivan in 2009, venting his frustration with those who told him ‘some good’ could come out of such a tragedy.

Talent: Cameron, seen eating breakfast at Camp Bastion, also revealed he played the drums at Eton

‘Even though Ivan was very disabled and very ill, it was all just a total shock. We had no idea he was going to suddenly die in the way he did,’ he said.

‘But the person who says to you, “There’s a silver lining to all this,” or “Some good will come of all this,” you actually want to thump.

‘It’s the most annoying thing anybody can possibly say.’

Reflecting on his own childhood, Mr Cameron praised his favourite teacher at Eton, the ‘wonderful’ Michael Kitson who ‘woke me up to the excitement of history’

And he revealed a modest, musical talent: he had played the drums in a school band – and ‘once stood in for someone in a jazz band, for one night only’.

He also talked about his religious beliefs, saying: ‘I’m a classic Church of England member, but part of its strength is the fact that it doesn’t ask us to sign up to too much of a canon...but I’ve always found the teachings of Jesus and the Bible quite useful as a sort of handy guide.

‘But there are plenty of other guides you could use. I find this one works for me.’

David Cameron has taken a swipe at Jeremy Paxman following his claims that the Prime Minister was a ‘complete idiot’ for the way he plans to mark the centenary of the First World War.

The Newsnight host has said he is ‘troubled’ over Mr Cameron’s plans to ‘celebrate such a calamity’  – and has denounced Education Secretary Michael Gove for calling the conflict ‘just’.

Now Mr Cameron has criticised Mr Paxman’s book on British history, saying he preferred a work by Jan Morris, which salutes our military victories.

Conflict: David Cameron's plans to mark the centenary of World War One were branded 'idiotic' by Jeremy Paxman. But he has hit back by dismissing the Newsnight presenter's book, Great Britain's Great War

And in his interview with Mail on Sunday Editor Geordie Greig, the Prime Minister used near-identical language to his political and personal confidant, Mr Gove to describe the First World War.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We should be clear that World War I was a war fought in a just cause, that our ancestors thought it would be bad to have a Prussian-dominated Europe, and that is why they fought.

‘One can read the poems of Wilfred Owen and find them extremely moving but still understand why Britain went to war in 1914 and what the consequences would have been had we not.’

Mr Paxman – whose latest  book Great Britain’s Great War describes the conflict as the point where Britons realised their future ‘would never be as grand as their past’ – criticised the description, ‘a just war’ when Mr Gove used it, saying: ‘I’m not sure it’s a helpful phrase.’

Mr Cameron, who for Christmas gave each of his eight godchildren a copy of Robert Graves’s ‘brilliant’ war book Goodbye To All That, was speaking two weeks before Mr Gove rounded on Left-wing academics for using fictions such as Blackadder to ‘feed the myth’ that WW1 was ‘unpatriotic’ and  a ‘misbegotten shambles’.

His words came weeks before Michael Gove attacked Left-wing academics and Blackadder for 'feeding a myth'

Mr Cameron has another dig at Mr Paxman when he says said he had recently read two books on the Empire: one by Jan Morris and one by Mr Paxman.

‘Jan Morris’ book was much better,’ he said, bluntly.

It is the latest exchange in a war of words between both Tory politicians and Mr Paxman that stretches back nearly a decade.

The tension was most obvious in a 2010 interview when Mr Paxman asked Mr Cameron six times if  he would raise VAT, and sneered: ‘People look at you and George Osborne and see two immensely privileged young men with a glint in their eye.’

Gig: The Prime Minister and his wife Samantha recently 'sneaked' into a concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire to see Scandinavian sisters Johanna and Klara Soderberg as First Aid Kit

The Prime Minister has revealed how he and his wife Samantha recently ‘sneaked’ into a concert by an obscure Swedish folk duo.

And he admitted it wasn’t the first time they had joined the audience at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London.

‘There’s quite a good way of sneaking in there,’ he said.

The latest visit was to see Scandinavian sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg, pictured left, who perform as First Aid Kit.

Mr Cameron, who has previously claimed to be a fan of rock bands The Smiths and Coldplay, says in today’s Event magazine: ‘I’ve got into a bit of a countryish thing.’

First Aid Kit, whose sound is defined by melancholic harmonies and wistful lyrics, have yet to break into the mainstream – although they have gained a significant following online, attracting more than four million YouTube views.

Aptly for their new fan, their tracks include one titled Blue – although it’s a downbeat number about a depressed woman mourning the death of the only man she ever loved and unlikely ever to be adopted as a party anthem.

Samantha Cameron is also a fan – once telling fellow musicians Mumford and Sons about their work.

Johanna and Klara Söderberg – 23 and 21 respectively –  come from the Stockholm suburb of Enskede and say their music is influenced by their activism on issues including environmentalism, Guantanamo Bay and the ultimately successful campaign to free Russian punk band Pussy Riot.

David Cameron’s music tastes have come under fire from some musicians, with The Smiths’ Johnny Marr even ‘forbidding’ him from listening to their songs.

But the PM insists The Smiths are still played regularly at home.
