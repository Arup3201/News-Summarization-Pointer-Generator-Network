A Sydney father has told of his terrifying brush with a terror suspect just moments before he entered a downtown cafe and took dozens of people hostage. 

Craig Stoker, from Eastlakes in Sydney's south, said he bumped into the gunman on the street just outside the cafe after he bought a coffee from the café on Monday morning, News Limited reports.

Mr Stoker described the man as wearing a black shirt with white writing and similar headband, carrying a blue bag and walking with two other similarly dressed men.

'The bag bumped into me and there was something hard in it. I said "watch where you are f***ing going",' Mr Stoker said.

'He turned round and said "do you want me to shoot you too". I looked into his eyes and they were crazy.' 

Later, witnesses reported seeing one or two men walk into the café and pull a weapon from a blue bag. Seconds later police were on the scene.

Rodrigo Neryt said he was arriving at Channel 7 for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the café

Police have begun to evacuate people from the first floor of the building above the Lindt Cafe 

Family and friends of a hostage still inside the cafe have told Daily Mail Australia they were in the dark about what was going on.

'We weren't told anything at all and we heard there was a place for family to sit and wait but [officers] didn't know anything about it,' the family friend said.

'But then again how do they [officers] know we are for real [actually family]?'  

Rodrigo Neryt said he was arriving at Channel 7 for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the café. 

Rosemary Healion, who works at Frederick Jordan Chambers, told Daily Mail Australia 'a couple hundred' of her colleagues were inside

'I was at the corner when everything started. I saw people yelling and screaming and two police cars arriving at the scene,' Mr Neryt told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I saw what looked like a black ISIS flag and they were holding it up.' 

The fiancé of one of the café staff being held hostage told The Guardian that their partner had only been working at the chocolate café for six months. 

'She's the sweetest person ever who thinks about everyone. She took some of my old shoes and made me wash them and she gave them to a homeless guy. She just cares about everyone,' the fiancé, who preferred to remain anonymous, said. 

Police were seen evacuating people from the first floor of the building above the Lindt Cafe.

Rosemary Healion, who works at Frederick Jordan Chambers, told Daily Mail Australia that 'a couple hundred' of her colleagues were inside at the time.

'My colleagues are still in there. They're trying to get them out now,' Ms Healion told Daily Mail Australia.

'I have been in contact with them.' 

Ms Healion said her office was on the ground floor of the same building in which the Lindt Cafe is located. 

She said they had been pushed behind the office's reception area.

'I'm so so worried as you would be. I was about to walk into the cafe. I get coffee there all the time.' 

Window cleaner, David Wilson, managed to get a birds-eye-view of police swarming into Martin Place as he and a colleague cleaned the windows of a building across from the Lindt Chocolate Café. 

'We were looking around and there were cops running around and guns drawn. Some people came out, they looked like just coffee drinkers and that was about all we saw,' Mr Wilson said, adding that his colleague's first response was to get out his phone and start filming.

Gabriella Barry and Lisa Maloney, who work at a nearby barrister company, were evacuated after being locked in their 36 floor building directly opposite the café.

They said their building was full of people when the siege began and that at least 20 floors were taken up by government officers and treasuries.

'We've been locked in since 11am. We were told nothing but we could see across the road. We saw all the police and the café. We've had so many phone calls form friends, colleagues and barristers trying to come back to the building,' Ms Barry said.

'We've had phone calls and we've been trying to say it's ok. We were shaking; we were hearing things through the phone and the internet.'

When asked if they had heard that the siege was part of a terrorist attack, Ms Maloney added: 'It's shocking. It doesn't happen in this country. No one knows how to react'. 

John Edwards works across the road from the cafe on the ninth floor of 53 Martin Place.

He said every floor of the building had been cleared about 11.15am.

'We were evacuated out of the building from the basement,' Mr Edwards told Daily Mail Australia.

'All we were told by security was to get out.'
