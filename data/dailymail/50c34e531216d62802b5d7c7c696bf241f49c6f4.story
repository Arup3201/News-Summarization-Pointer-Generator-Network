England wicketkeeper Matt Prior has hit back at claims by TV personality Piers Morgan that he launched a dressing room tirade at Andy Flower during the team's disastrous tour of Australia.

Morgan claimed on Twitter that Prior, who was dropped after the third Test in Perth, told the England team after the fourth Test in Melbourne that coach Flower was 'behaving like a headmaster' and they were playing in a 'schoolboy environment.'

The storm comes 24 hours after England selectors sacked batsman Kevin Pietersen in the wake of Englandâ€™s 5-0 Ashes defeat Down Under.

Morgan tweeted on Wednesday afternoon:
 'I'm about to tweet what @MattPrior13 told England players in team 
meeting after Melbourne Test.

''Flower's
 behaving like a headmaster, this is a schoolboy environment. F**k 
Flower! This is OUR team!' - @MattPrior13 to England team.'

Morgan went on to claim Prior was a 'hypocrite' and challenged him to take legal action if his accusations were incorrect.

He
 added: 'You stabbed @KP24 [Pietersen] in the back @MattPrior13 - yet 
you agreed with him re Flower's dictator style. Makes you a flaming 
hypocrite.'

'For the record, @MattPrior13 led the England team meeting after Melbourne Test. And slaughtered Flower.

'If you didn't say it @MattPrior13 - then sue me. That should clear things up.'

But Prior took to Twitter shortly afterwards to defend himself against Morgan's claims.

He
 wrote: 'I don't do this PR, spinning media rubbish but I refuse to be 
attacked by a bloke that knows very little about what goes on in the 
England setup apart from rumour, gossip and hearsay from certain 
individuals (most of whom I'd take with a pinch of salt).

'Maybe
 I was recorded or 'hacked' but if not I'd like to see where these words
 I apparently said have come from? I'm not the kind of person to divelge
 [sic] what is said in team meetings but all I will say is that Flower, 
[Alastair] Cook and the rest of my team mates know exactly what I said 
& the way in which it was meant!

Re-integrated: Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '"Re-integration complete. Well played".'

'There
 is no story here just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had
 the teams best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the 
field to help the England cricket team.

'I can hold my head up high in that knowledge! #endof'

He
 then retweeted a message that pointed out Prior was one of the England 
team who defended Pietersen during the 'text-gate' scandal, in which the
 batsman sent text messages to members of the opposition 
dressing room during South Africa's tour of England in 2012.

However, in response, Morgan tweeted that Prior 'was actually one of the worst re KP' and Prior 'stabbed KP right in the back.'
