Children in Commonwealth countries today struggled to identify the Queen, pictured with the Glasgow games baton last year, with some thinking she was Angela Merkel

You would think the Queen has one of the most recognisable faces in the world.

But when a group of schoolchildren in Kenya were shown a picture of the royal, they couldn't identify her - and instead thought she was German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Others speaking with journalist Gabriel Gatehouse thought the Queen - who is Head of the Commonwealth - was Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff.

Later, BBC Radio 4's Andrew North interviewed pupils from Delhi, India.

The journalist showed several groups of children pictures of both Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince of Wales.

He then asked them: 'Do you recognise these two people.'

Many simply replied: 'No.'

Others, however, did do a little better - managing to correctly name the Queen but not Prince Charles while a few could correctly name both the royals.

One even said they thought their country shouldn't compete in the Commonwealth Games 'as it has only a symbolic relevance in the country'.

The footage, played on the Today Show this morning, comes just hours before the Queen will officially open the Glasgow 2014 Games.

A crowd of 40,000 people are expected to gather at the city's Celtic Park for the ceremony - which will begin at 9pm BST.

Organisers say they are expecting up to a billion people around the world to watch the event - which will include performances from Rod Stewart and Susan Boyle.

About 4,500 sportspeople from the 71 competing nations and territories will parade through the venue in the event that organisers claim will be 'uniquely Glaswegian and Scottish.'

The Queen is due to read out a message that was hidden inside a Commonwealth Games Baton at Buckingham Palace in October last year.

Following the Radio 4 broadcast this morning Kamalesh Sharma - the Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations - insisted the Queen has played 'enormously cementing role' for Commonwealth nations and territories.

He said: 'Whole point of Commonwealth is 
how it straddles old and new, moving from involuntary relationship to 
voluntary relationship.'

Chris Hoy, the six time Olympic cycling champion and Commonwealth Ambassador, later told the show he would be feeling 'emotional' at the opening ceremony this evening.

The 38-year-old added: 'As soon as the opening ceremony starts, I think people are going to be swept away with the excitement.

'Ok, it is not quite the same profile as the Olympic Games, but it has got its place.

'The athletes are taking it very, very seriously and for many athletes it is a spring board to a fantastic career.

'For many athletes it is the peak or the pinnacle of their career. Some train their whole lives to represent their country at Commonwealth Games'

The Games will feature 17 sports over 
11 days of competition.

The sporting action begins tomorrow morning.

The closing ceremony is to take place at Hampden Stadium on 3 August.
