New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents investigating a Florida anti-aging clinic at the center of baseball's doping scandal, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday.

Rodriguez, 39, publicly has denied the use of banned substances from the Miami-area Biogenesis clinic, even as he concluded last week a one-year suspension by Major League Baseball for violating the league's doping program.

But speaking to federal authorities in January, Rodriguez admitted to buying and using hormone-filled syringes and creams from the clinic, the Herald reported, citing a 15-page summary of the meeting.

Career blow: New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday

The Herald gained access to the documents as prosecutors pursue criminal charges against the clinic's owner and six others tied to one of sport's biggest doping scandals, including Rodriguez's cousin, Yuri Sucart.

In the meeting, Rodriguez admitted to paying for and using banned substances, the Herald reported.

Rodriguez injected human growth hormone into his stomach, according to the report reviewed by the newspaper, and described to federal authorities how the owner of the now-defunct clinic gave him tips on evading Major League Baseball's doping tests.

Ron Berkowitz, Rodriguez's agent, could not immediately be reached for comment. MLB had no comment on the article.

A spokeswoman for the Miami field office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said she did not know what report the Herald cited, and declined further comment in the case. 

Federal prosecutors also declined to comment.

Anthony Bosch, who owned the clinic where prosecutors allege professional athletes paid as much as $12,000 per month for testosterone-filled syringes and creams, pled guilty last month to a felony charge of conspiracy to distribute testosterone.

Rodriguez who was recently reinstated to the Yankees roster, was only 18 years old when he made his major league debut with the Seattle Mariners in 1994.

He established himself as one of baseball's top sluggers, driving in more than 100 runs in 14 seasons and hitting more than 30 home runs 14 times.

He was the American League's most valuable player in 2003, 2005 and 2007.
