Real Madrid's dream of turning Zinedine Zidane into their very own version of Pep Guardiola is currently in ruins with the French legend's team rooted to the foot of Spain's third division B.

The sight of the immaculately suited-and-booted midfield legend sat in the dug-out next to Carlo Ancelotti last season or pacing the touchline with the Madrid B team this campaign have raised expectations that he could follow the same kind of route as the former Barcelona boss.

Like Guardiola, Zidane had been a playing legend for the club, and now, like Guardiola, he is starting out coaching the club's kids but so far all has not gone according to plan.

Zinedine Zidane is currently managing Real Madrid Castilla, who are bottom of Segunda Division B 

The Real Madrid legend may also be facing a 6-month ban for working without the correct licence 

Castilla, as Real's second string are known, are currently on three points at the foot of the table, having lost five of their opening six fixtures. 

The poor start to the season comes at a bad time for the club's homegrown players amid plans to streamline the youth set-up, scrapping Real Madrid's C team, and the prospect that Zidane could also be banned from coaching for six months if found guilty of managing Castilla without the correct licence.

Spain's national association of coaches, CENAFE, made a complaint about the former World Cup winner at the start of the season and now the country's Competitions Committee is studying the possibility that Real have broken rule 104 of their code which could lead to a ban of between four and 16 games (or one to six months).

The Frenchman spent last season working as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant as they won the Champions League

Many at the club had expected Zidane to take over from Ancelotti at some point, but that now looks unlikely

Head coaches in Spain need to have a level three national coaching diploma and Zidane is still to obtain the relevant qualification.

The president of CENAFE Miguel Galan, who made the original complaint, said: 'Real Madrid is one of the most recognisable sporting institutions in the world and a symbol of this sport but they have to follow the same rules as everyone else otherwise the competition is not fair.'

With the prospect of a ban hanging over him, Zidane must try to drag Castilla away from the bottom of the table. The club relies on its B side to produce players for the first team but that cannot happen if it is competing in the fourth tier of Spanish football.
