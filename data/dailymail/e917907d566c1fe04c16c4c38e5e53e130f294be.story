South Africa set new records as they opened their World Cup campaign with a 62-run victory over Zimbabwe.

Centurions David Miller and JP Duminy were the stars for the Proteas with an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 256 runs in less than 30 overs.

The stand, a record partnership for South Africa in the competition, was also a new best for the fifth wicket in all World Cup matches.

It helped South Africa to reach 339 for four from their 50 overs, after they had made a sluggish start to the Pool B contest in Hamilton.

The total proved too much for Zimbabwe, who could only manage 277 all out in reply as their final five wickets fell for just 41 runs.

Yet the Proteas, put into bat, had struggled early on.

The first over, bowled by Tinashe Panyangara, was a maiden - and they lost their first wicket in the fourth over when Quinton de Kock chipped a Tendai Chatara delivery straight to Craig Ervine and departed for seven.

It was 21 for two in the ninth over when Hashim Amla was bowled by Panyangara for 11.

Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers shared a stand of 46 in 8.4 overs until Du Plessis was caught by Brendan Taylor off the bowling of Elton Chigumbura for 24. 

And 16 runs later it was 83 for four when some smart fielding on the boundary by Ervine enabled him to catch De Villiers for 25.

However, that was as good as it got for Zimbabwe, as Duminy and Miller teamed up to devastating effect.

The last six overs produced 112 runs, with Miller bringing up his century - off 81 balls - in the 46th.

He took 30 runs from the 48th, bowled by Solomon Mire, and finished undefeated on 138, from 92 balls. His innings contained nine sixes and seven fours.

Duminy reached his century in the final over, from 96 balls, and finished with 115 from 100 deliveries. His contribution included three sixes and nine fours.

Zimbabwe lost Sikandar Raza for five in the seventh over when he chopped a Vernon Philander delivery on to his off stump with the team total on 32. 

Their first 100 runs came up in the 19th over, after Chamu Chibhabha had notched his 10th ODI fifty, but the opener departed shortly after when he holed out to Duminy at the extra-cover boundary to give Imran Tahir his first wicket of the competition.

Hamilton Masakadza brought up his fifty in fine style by despatching Dale Steyn over the cover boundary for a sweetly-struck six, and he reached 80 before Tahir tricked him into spooning to cover. His 74-ball innings included eight fours and two sixes.

Captain Brendan Taylor picked up where Masakadza left off and he made a run-a-ball 40 before falling to Morne Morkel at the start of the 37th over.

Zimbabwe were five down when Sean Williams top-edged Duminy to give wicketkeeper De Kock a routine catch.

The loss of two quick wickets really hampered Zimbabwe's chances of winning the match and, with 106 required from the final 10 overs, their middle and lower order crumbled under the pressure.

Chigumbura (eight) was run out in the 41st over by De Villiers, who took a regulation catch at mid on off Steyn's bowling to dismiss Ervine two overs later.

De Villiers took his second catch of the innings to leave Zimbabwe eight down in the very next over as Tahir, who finished with figures of three for 36, tricked Panyangara into providing a leading edge as he attempted to sweep the leg-spinner. De Villiers had his third catch when he snaffled Mire (27) at deep mid-wicket.

South Africa completed what in the end proved to be a comfortable victory when Morkel caught Tendai Chatara (six) off his own bowling as Zimbabwe were dismissed well short.
