A teenage romance turned into a tragedy when police in Phoenix, Arizona, say a 15-year-old boy shot dead his ex-girlfriend before ending his own life.

Matthew Bolton and 16-year-old Anastasia 'Ana' Greer were both sophomores at Sandra Day O'Connor High School, and the girl had recently broke up with the 15-year-old.

According to police, the murder-suicide played out Friday at a home of Greer's friend in north Phoenix.

Police say Bolton didn't go to school that day, and it is unclear how he got the gun, which was found on a sidewalk near the bodies.

Officers responded to a 911 call of a shooting around noon and found two people dead in the home's front yard from gunshot wounds.

Investigators said Bolton got a ride to the home in the 4000 block of West Villa Linda and met the girl in front of the house.

A neighbor, Jim Friel, told The Arizona Republic that he heard a scream and then gunshots and went across the street to the home to see what happened.

Grieving friends described Ana Greer as a kind and outgoing girl who was active in her school's ROTC program. 

Classmate Caleb Fleck told the station KPHO that Bolton, who was in his ROTC class, was well-behaved and was never known to be a troublemaker.

On his Facebook page, Matthew posted on Valentine's Day a photo of him and Greer smiling and holding a red 'I love you' teddy bear with a heart-shaped nose. 

According police, just hours before the shooting, officials at Sandra Day O'Conner High School learned that a gun was spotted on the premises, and Bolton's name came up.

Students had an early release at 11am, but security officers were unable to locate the 16-year-old or the weapon on campus.

Henry Gano, who was in the area of Villa Linda Friday morning, said he noticed what he initially thought to be a couple of teens chasing one another and horsing around â€“ that is until he saw a gun in the boyâ€™s hand.
