On a day made remarkable by many things, not least the sheer scale of the turnout, the courage of one man was always going to shine through.

Staring death in the face but refusing to flinch, Fernando Ricksen deserved every full-throated cheer and moist-eyed tribute delivered at Ibrox yesterday.

Crippled by the motor-neurone disease that will eventually claim his life, Ricksen was just able to take the ceremonial kick-off in an exhibition match between a Rangers Select and Fernando's All Stars, stumbling and tumbling to the turf moments after making contact with the ball.

If that was a heartbreaking sight for all who turned out to thank the Dutchman for his contribution to the club, it is worth noting what happened after he fell down. He got back up. With the help of his former team-mates, he rose again to take the applause of 41,349 paying punters.

Why were so many moved to venture forth on a dreich winter's day for a bounce game involving old boys in varying states of (dis)repair?

It was an appreciation not just of what Ricksen did in his playing days, but of how he is facing down this horrifying illness.

'Even the fact that MND patients don't have more than three years to live doesn't get me down,' he said in an interview conducted for the commemorative programme.

'Scared? No, because what's going to happen is inevitable. OK, maybe I have only a couple of years left. That doesn't scare me, it's just that I would love to live a lot longer. I want to see my daughter growing up. That's what I'll fight for.

'One person should be the first to defeat this terrible disease. Well, let me be that person then! I will show the world what fighting spirit means.

'But if death comes, well, it comes. What can you do about it? I've always been like that. Never been afraid of flying either, unlike most of my Russian team-mates (from his time with Dick Advocaat at Zenit St Petersburg).

'I always told them: 'If we go down, we go down'. Which was quite likely with those Russian aircraft, by the way!

'I don't want to feel too much sympathy. I am not pitiful. Please don't treat me that way. It will be tough but I'll keep my head up.

'It was a shock (when I got the diagnosis). Especially after I had Googled what the illness exactly means. All of a sudden, you know you may be dead within a year.

'I still hope the doctors have made a mistake. That, one day, they will say it isn't MND. As long as I don't have the really heavy symptoms of MND, it's a straw I keep grasping at.

'I know it sounds strange but being chased by the Grim Reaper doesn't affect your life that much. Not when your motto is: 'Don't look back'.

'We avoid pessimism and depression by not talking and thinking too much about the disease. That's one of the reasons why we don't shoot an enormous amount of footage of our life as it is today.

'For my daughter, Isabella, that would put too much emphasis on the illness.' 

Ibrox was packed full of supporters offering tributes to former player Ricksen

The money raised from yesterday's match will be split four ways, with Ricksen and young Isabella each receiving a share, and the remainder going to MND Scotland and the Rangers Charity Foundation.

Among those to have contributed include old foes Celtic — with a £10,000 donation — a fact that didn't greatly surprise the man himself, as he revealed: 'It isn't true that all Celtic supporters have always hated me.

'When I was playing for Zenit, lots of Scottish tourists wanted to have their picture taken with me on the Red Square — even Celtic fans. That was very rewarding. So I must have done something good.'

Ricksen had been back to Ibrox in a playing role since his departure for Rangers, turning out for Zenit in a friendly. But yesterday was different. In a very familiar way.

The crazy traffic, the huge queues that saw kick-off delayed by half an hour, it was like a throwback to more successful times in Govan.

Former Rangers winger Neil McCann noted: 'It's great to see such a big crowd at Ibrox again. I gave Fernando a hug and said: 'This feels like the old times'.'

Fans held banners, scarfs and signs and chanted Ricksen's name during the tribute

The former Old Firm warrior was accompanied by Isabella as he made his way between a guard of honour formed by both teams before kick-off, the atmosphere creeping closer to spine-tingling levels as he slowly marched out.

With his ability to speak severely damaged by the disease, the look of joy on Ricksen's face said as much as words ever could.

The game itself was, of course, an afterthought, a 7-4 romp for the All Stars. Gordon Durie, Peter Lovenkrands, Thomas Buffel and Nacho Novo scored for the home team, while James Beattie was among the many visitors to find the net — the first time this particular former Rangers player had ever scored at Ibrox.

There was only one choice for Man of the Match, though, Ricksen lauded again as his name was announced, then receiving a further standing ovation as he came back on the pitch for a lap of honour.

He was carried aloft on the shoulders his team-mates, borne ever higher by the goodwill of all in attendance.

And the last word went to the man himself, in a way, too, when his close friend Roy Knez read out a statement on his behalf declaring: 'Fellow Blue Noses, thank you for your support today. The numbers who turned out make me feel so happy. It gives me a fighting spirit.

'When I played here, I gave everything for the world's most successful club. Now the club and the fans have given me so much more back. I need it now.

'I've never been so proud to be a Rangers man. Thank you. I love you. Rangers forever.'
