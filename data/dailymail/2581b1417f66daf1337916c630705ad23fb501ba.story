Great Britain’s Lizzy Yarnold won gold at the world skeleton championships in Germany yesterday to complete a grand slam of major titles.

The European and Olympic champion achieved her dream treble with the help of a second track record in as many days.

Yarnold claimed glory in Winterberg in a combined time for her four runs of 3min 49.95sec, which saw her finish an emphatic 0.67sec ahead of Germany’s Jacqueline Lolling on her home track, with Canada’s Elisabeth Vathje taking third.

The 26-year-old from Kent said: ‘I can’t quite take it all in, it has been absolutely amazing.

‘It has been a lot of hard work and I couldn’t have done it without my team and all my support. But I am so pleased I can say I’m world champion as well as Olympic champion and European champion — it’s all I’ve ever wanted.’

She then revealed she had suffered from a rare case of major nerves, such was her desire to take the title, last won by compatriot Shelley Rudman in St Moritz two years ago.

‘I wanted this win so badly,’ she added. ‘It’s unusual for me to be that nervous before a race, but I knew this was the one, the ultimate goal.

‘After I won the Olympics last year my mind switched to this race. I wanted to win the World Championships to complete the set.’

Yarnold’s team-mate Laura Deas finished seventh with fellow Briton Rose McGrandle ninth.
