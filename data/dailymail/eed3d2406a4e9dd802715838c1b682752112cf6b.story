They met in the departure lounge - then went around the world together. 

It was a trip-of-a-lifetime that sparked global attention after Jordan Axani, 28, offered to take any Canadian girl called Elizabeth Gallagher on his Christmas vacation.

He booked the trip with his ex-girlfriend - Elizabeth Gallagher - and was determined not to waste her non-transferable ticket when they broke up.  

Now, after three weeks and eight countries, he and Elizabeth 'Quinn' Gallagher, 23, have returned.

But no, they say, there was no romance. 

'We're like siblings!': Jordan Axani, 28, (right) took Elizabeth 'Quinn' Gallgher, 23, (left) around the world with his ex-girlfriend's non-transferable ticket. The pair, pictured in Bangkok, said the trip lived up to their expectations

Merry Christmas! Axani and Gallagher said their Christmas Day in Vienna, Austria (pictured), was magical

'It sort of brought out this brother-sister dynamic between us,' Mr Axani told CTV News.  

Ms Gallagher, a part-time office administrator and student who already has a long-term boyfriend, told local media: 'We probably got along better because we were strangers. We didn't have a relationship to break.'

The pair set off on December 21 from Toronto and returned on January 8, visiting New York, Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, New Delhi, Khao Lak, and Hong Kong.

Christmas Day in Vienna was a relaxed affair - which they largely spent apart.

Ms Gallagher, from Nova Scotia, spoke to her boyfriend, whose identity has remained undisclosed, between taking a bus tour of the Austrian city.

Mr Axani spent the day working on his new charity project: A Ticket Forward, giving vacations to survivors of disease, war and abuse. 

New York, New York! Their first stop was in New York City, where they got a drink to get to know each other

Last hurrah: Their final stop was in Hong Kong (pictured) where they spent the day in Soho to celebrate

Axani posted this adventurous picture on Instagram in their final week with the caption: 'Throwback to awkwardly holding a King Crab yesterday in a seafood market in #HongKong... while filming. #itwasnthappy'

But they later joined other tourists and expats for a Christmas fun fair and agreed it was the best day of the trip. 

After getting over the initial awkwardness of meeting at the airport, they soon got to know each other, and their traveling tastes. 

'Quinn liked to see the [landmarks] of different areas, and I liked to mingle where the locals hang out,' Mr Axani told the BBC.

'I hate heights and everywhere we went, she took me to the highest thing possible - whether it was the highest level of the Eiffel Tower, or the highest bar in Bangkok - and she'd poke fun of me for my fear of heights.'

Meanwhile Quinn's sense of direction was a constant source of amusement for both of them. Mr Axani said: 'I would get these tweets and emails from the strangest places on a quasi-frequent level of her being trapped in a stairway at the hotel or being lost in an airport or missing a train.

'And that sort of characterized our relationship, and is a lot of where the big brother little sister thing came out.' 

Ms Gallagher has no regrets.

'It was wild,' she told The Morning Show. 'And it's just because of my name... I have to thank my mother for that.'  

Travel companions: Jordan Axani (left) started an online campaign last month to find someone with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to travel with him on a round-the-world Christmas vacation, since he couldn't transfer the tickets.

Just friends: However, the trip was completely platonic since Gallagher already has a boyfriend, who is apparently not so pleased to see her leave on a vacation with another man. Pictured above with a man who appears to be her boyfriend on Facebook

Pick me, pick me! Gallagher tweeted this picture of her Canadian passport when she heard Axani was looking for someone to join him on his epic vacation from New York to New Dehli 

'He understands that I've always wanted to travel so while he's not happy I'm taking off for nearly a month at Christmas with a random guy he's smiling through it,' Gallagher said of her boyfriend, who she plans to purchase a home with. 

Gallagher says she initially thought the trip was 'crazy' but was put at ease after spending hours talking to Axani over the phone. 

'It definitely did seem a little bit creepy at the beginning but now that I talked to him it's less creepy and more awesome,' she said.   

The original Elizabeth Gallagher: Axani (left) originally planned to spend this Christmas holiday travelling around the world with former girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher (left). She broke up with him after they bought all of the plane tickets 

Because Axani stopped planning the trip when he broke up with his girlfriend, he didn't book any hotels for the trip. 

However, after the story went viral online, Marriott International stepped up to provide Axani and his companion with separate rooms at each stop on their journey.   

Of the thousands of emails he received in his search, he got one especially touching message from an 8-year-old boy who was going blind and wanted to see the world before losing his vision. 

That message inspired Axani, who works in international real estate, to start an organization with his brother called A Ticket Forward to help people who want to travel but don't have the money.

Axani initially started his search on Reddit last month, posting a plea that said: 'I need your help. You see, in March I booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this Christmas for my ex and I. 

Desperate: In November, Axani posted this message to Reddit in an attempt to find another Elizabeth Gallagher willing to join him on the trip 

'While our relationship has come to a close, I am still planning on going on the trip and she is not (naturally). 

'And because I hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste, I am looking for a Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher who could use the ticket.

'Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible. 

'Moreover, the flights were purchased during a massive blow-up on Priceline and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they're not worth the headache or money to cancel.' 

Before potential candidates started applying to accompany him, he laid some ground rules, but also offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off.

Giving: The campaign opened up Axani to how lucky he was to be taking such a vacation, and he has since launched a charity to help other people travel who can't afford it 

He wrote: 'I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the Christmas Market in Prague. 

'If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness.

'We can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not. I'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing (see ya on the plane!). 

'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I'm likely game.

'This is for the flights only. In the wake of the breakup I have deferred all further planning for the trip. No hotels, trains or anything have been booked. You're on your own, bucko. Having said that, I will buy the first round of vino at JFK upon departure.'
