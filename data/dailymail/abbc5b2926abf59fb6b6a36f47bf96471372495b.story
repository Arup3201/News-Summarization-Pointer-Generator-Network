Andy Murray's trusted lieutenant Dani Vallverdu is believed to have considered his future with the deposed Wimbledon champion in the wake of Wednesday's Wimbledon quarter final letdown.

With Amelie Mauresmo having departed back to France there was still no official word from the Murray camp about how their discussions of Friday had concluded, with issues still apparently to be resolved.

Among them, according to well-placed sources, are the frustrations of the 28-year-old Venezuelan who for nearly four years has been a constant at the side of Murray, who he first met when they were fellow teenage students at a Barcelona Tennis Academy.

Vallverdu's influence in the recent career of Murray and his major successes tends to have been underrated as he has worked largely in the shadow of high profile figures like Ivan Lendl and, for the past few weeks, Mauresmo.

While he has got on well with the French former player, as Murray has done, a point of contention to said to have been the manner of her appointment. While Vallverdu was kept in the loop throughout the process of Lendl being brought in, he and other members of the backroom staff are said to have been taken by surprise that talks with Mauresmo were as far as advanced as they were in Paris.

That has added to a growing sense of being under-appreciated, which may have been exacerbated by what happened on Wednesday. While year-round Murray watchers will know that outbursts at his box are nothing new, the focus is much magnified at Wimbledon.

Lendl would go out of his way to praise Vallverdu's role in a team that is clearly under general evaluation by Murray as he plots how to get back towards the top after his ranking slides to number ten on Monday.

During the Czech's increasingly long absences towards the end of the partnership Vallverdu, who last night denied he was about to jump ship, was the ever-present. His role remains vital as it is clear that, even if Mauresmo continues, she does not want to travel full-time on the tour.

For instance Murray is now keen to restart training soon in Miami and he would be expected to supervise that while she takes a holiday. He is said to want assurances about his role and stature within the team.

Other members, such as the influential Florida-based fitness trainer Jez Green, are also believed to be demanding that a clear structure is established going forward if Mauresmo is going to be in for the long haul.

Vallverdu, a mild-mannered and genial former top American college player who is very well-liked on the tour, knows Murray better than anyone. As well as having a good tennis brain he understands the 27 year-old Scot's moods and rage for perfection and if he ever left it would be a major blow.
