An adorable dog who was facing her tenth festive season in a dog shelter has finally found a home - just in time for Christmas.

Sophie, the corgi-collie cross, has been unable to find a home for almost a decade, but after her fate hit the headlines last week the shelter was overwhelmed with calls.

And in her very own Christmas miracle she is now settled with a new family with a cosy place in front of the fire.

An adorable dog who was facing her tenth festive season in a dog shelter has finally found a home - just in time for Christmas

Sophie, the corgi-collie cross, has been unable to find a home for almost a decade, but after her fate hit the headlines last week the shelter was overwhelmed with calls

The 11-year-old had been at Hilbrae Kennels, Shropshire, since she was just two-years-old and was regularly passed over for more fashionable breeds and younger dogs.

But when dog-lovers Irene and Ken Duffy saw her smiling face and read her heart-wrenching story they knew they had to meet her.

Retired Irene, 70, said: 'We knew as soon as we saw her that we wanted to bring her home with us.

'We've had our little Jack Russell Toby for seven years, and my husband did say 'No more dogs'. But when we both saw her little face we said 'Oh we will have her'.' 

The couple made the two hour journey from their home in Oldham, Manchester, on Saturday to the kennels to see if Sophie was the dog for them where they took her for a walk and got to know her.

When they returned on Sunday a senior dog handler assessed the couple and decided they were the perfect fit.

Irene said: 'After we heard that she had been in the shelter for nine years I called them straight away to see if we could meet her. It just snowballed from there.

Staff at Hilbrae Kennels, Shropshire, including Leanne Breeze the kennel assistant pictured here, were overwhelmed with responses after they appealed for a new owner for Sophie last week

'We went to the shelter in Shropshire on both days over the weekend to see if she liked us but we would have gone back again and again if that's what it took.

'We used to have a Lurcher, who was also called Sophie, but she died about five months ago so I'm glad that Toby has got a new friend.

'My husband Ken, 65, and I were both in the RAF for 22 years and it wasn't fair to have a dog who would need to be quarantined every time we moved abroad so now it's lovely to have a pet at home.

New owner Irene, 70, said: 'We knew as soon as we saw her that we wanted to bring her home with us.'

'Sophie is quiet but a real charmer and her and Toby seem to be getting on well.

'She has already find a little place she likes to sit under the stairs and is getting used to cosying up in front of the fire place.

'We feel very lucky to have welcomed her into our family - she's a little Christmas miracle.'

Kennel supervisor Claudia Churchill said: 'We were all sad to say goodbye to Sophie after so many years - I was in tears - but it's the best thing for her.

'The morning she was in the paper the phone never stopped ringing - people were desperate to come and meet her.

'But her new owners are a perfect fit and all being well, she'll have a loving family for the rest of her life.

'I can't believe she's got a home in time for Christmas - it's the best present.'

Although Sophie has gone to a good home, the team are still looking for homes for more than 70 dogs.

And this comes as another dog charity appeals for owners, as their kennels are filled to capacity.

The Border Collie Trust is facing a 'bottleneck' in its waiting list this festive period, with all of its kennels full to the brim. 

The unique charity is at capacity in terms of housing abandoned collies and has to operate a 'one out, one in' system.

Ben Wilkes, a trustee of the Staffordshire-based charity pictured here with eight-year-old Dan, said: 'It's a bit like a conveyor belt - as one goes out there are five waiting to come in

Earlier this year a survey rating the attributes of each dog breed according to cost, intelligence, health, lifespan and ease of grooming placed the bordie collie in the number one spot.

Ben Wilkes, a trustee of the Staffordshire-based charity, said: 'It's a bit like a conveyor belt - as one goes out there are five waiting to come in.We have 35 dogs at the moment and we usually have a waiting list, but it is very difficult to judge an average waiting list time because the situation changes every day.

'We take as much care of them as we can' said Ben 'but such a loving and intelligent animal would be much better off in a home enviroment'

Border collies were developed in the Scottish border region for herding livestock and are known for their unlimited energy and stamina. 

The centre, founded in the Seventies by Hazel Monk, has 11 staff who look after the dogs, taking them for walks and making sure they don't become distressed being in kennels. 

Ben added: 'There are 47 kennels but we don't like to have them all full because it would prevent us taking in emergency cases and it's too much for the dogs to cope with. The problem is something we see all year round. The phrase 'a dog is for life not just for Christmas' is a very apt one and I think it's maybe still true but in my 17 years' experience of rescuing it happens all year round. 

The Trust, based in Rugely in Staffs, takes collies of all ages who's owner circumstances mean they can no longer care for their pets, they also have puppies from farm litters where the farmer has no use for them

'People take on dogs and then decide, for whatever reason, they can't keep the dog. The difficulty at this time of year is historically rehoming goes quieter. People are thinking more about Christmas than adopting a dog so we tend to get this bit of a bottleneck.

'When people see these surveys saying they're the most intelligent or the best breed they want them as a pet, but dogs are more than a pet, they are a companion and you can't just tell them to sit in the corner for eight hours because you're busy.

'But Collies are a fantastic breed. We need to try to break that stigma about rescue dogs, they don't all have problems. You just need to know what you're taking on.'
