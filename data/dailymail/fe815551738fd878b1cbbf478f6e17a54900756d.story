Disgraced NHS chief Sir David Nicholson wants to join a Press regulator to defend the Health Service against newspapers that ‘hate’ it.

He was branded ‘the man with no shame’ after presiding over the Mid Staffs Hospital scandal, in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly.

Much of the appalling care at the hospital was uncovered by journalists and whistleblowers.

Resigned: Sir David Nicholson wants to join a Press regulator to defend the Health Service

Having resigned, he hopes to work with a new Press regulator to prevent so-called sensational stories undermining the NHS.

The news was met with incredulity by one campaigner who helped expose the scandal.

Julie Bailey, who set up the Cure The NHS group after her mother died following horrific care at the hospital, said: ‘This is exactly the job he should not be going for – so he can silence newspapers, silence whistleblowers and complainants.’

She hit the headlines after pressurising politicians to hold a public inquiry into Mid Staffs, which led to an announcement that the hospital trust would be dissolved.

She added: ‘If it had not been for newspapers and journalists exposing him, he would have continued to live in the long grass, reaping harm on the workforce and patients.

Former NHS CEO Sir Nicholson has been branded 'the man with no shame' by his detractors due to the number of stories that arose during the time of his leadership

‘We want the Press to be able to speak out about behaviour like this, performed while he has been in office. He should have nothing to do with the public and the public sector again.’

Sir David, who had to retire early from his £211,000 post as NHS chief executive, leaves next month on a £110,000-a-year pension.

He has been accused of presiding over a Stalinist culture in which staff were afraid to speak out about poor care.

As head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority from 2005 to 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire, he failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care there.

Elderly patients became so thirsty they drank dirty water from vases, while nurses left wards in tears because care was so poor.

When a report revealed that hundreds of patients may have died needlessly, Sir David insisted he was not ashamed of his record – comments that led to him being called ‘the man with no shame’.

Whistleblowers who contacted the former communist were paid off and made to sign gagging clauses.

The Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists.

It underpins with statute a body to oversee regulation, with publications that refuse to comply facing exemplary damages in libel cases.

Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up over fears that it would bring an end to 300 years of Press freedom.

Instead, the Press is establishing an independent body called the Independent Press Standards Organisation, able to impose fines of up to £1million for systemic wrongdoing.

Sir David claims to want to become a ‘non-executive director of the proposed Press regulator’ but did not specify which.

He said he did not intend to prevent criticism of individuals in the NHS or to ‘stop the Daily Mail doing whatever it does’, but to protect confidence in it as it strives to publish figures tracking quality of care.

He said a regulator would have an important role as the NHS tries to be more open about  failings, adding: ‘We’ve got to have a media and a context which is supportive of that.’

Otherwise, he said, coverage could result in staff being ‘frightened or hiding things’ which would be ‘really dangerous’.

‘My real worry is... we get attacked and what gets undermined is the principle of public services [and] public confidence.’

Asked if he thought newspaper coverage of Mid Staffs was motivated partly by a desire to attack the public sector, Sir David said: ‘It’s no accident is it that the people who led it hate the NHS?’
