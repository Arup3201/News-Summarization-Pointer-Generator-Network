She found fame as the glamorous postergirl of Made In Chelsea, so it's little surprise that Millie Mackintosh has been snapped up as the star of a sophisticated new shoot.

The 25-year-old has been unveiled as one of the ambassadors of the Investec Derby Festival alongside a host of famous faces who were hand-picked to represent everything from food and racing, to fashion and music.

Speaking about her latest coup, Millie said: 'Racing is one of those rare opportunities to combine glamorous outfits with statement hats. 

'I paired a Hobbs dress and Philip Treacy hat during the shoot, which I loved. The Derby is the pinnacle of the summer season and I’m looking forward to enjoying a spectacular day out.'

Millie stars alongside champion jockey Frankie Dettori MBE, Olympic Gold Medallist and BBC athletics presenter Denise Lewis OBE, presenter and DJ Laura Whitmore and two-star Michelin chef Michel Roux Jnr.

Speaking about the event, which takes place on June 5 and 6, Millie's good friend Laura Whitmore added: 'This will be my third year attending the Investec Derby and the fashion is just as much of a spectacle as the racing which is one of the reasons I love it. 

'I really enjoyed the shoot, getting to experience it with such a great group of people was fun!'.

Millie certainly knows a thing or two about how to dress for glamorous events. The star recently unveiled her spring/summer 15 drop full of bold floral patterns, hippy chic maxi dresses and the kind of festival fashion staples that she's made her signature.

'When it comes to summer dressing, you've just got to have fun with it. My clothes are really accessible and you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion,' she told FEMAIL.

As well as style expertise, Millie, who trained as a make-up artist before finding fame, is a beauty buff with her own eyelash range.

Sharing her top beauty tips for flawless summer skin, the star - a self-confessed sun worshiper - says SPF is essential.

'I loved sunbathing all my life and now I am so worried about sun damage so I always wear a tinted moisturiser with an SPF in and some cream bronzer and pastel eyeshadow for a natural sunkissed look.'

Aside from fashion and beauty, fitness is one of Millie's passions and she's a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches.

Whilst she's confident enough posting videos of her squatting, boxing and participating in the oh-so-fashionable but gruelling SBC class, there's one class Millie is afraid of trying.

'I really want to try this music video dance class at Frame studios but I am too embarrassed. I think it would be really fun and I probably need to learn to just let go of my inhibitions!'.

As well as cramming in fashion design and fitness classes, Millie is preparing to release her debut book at the end of the month.

If that wasn't enough, she's hoping to expand her eyelash range next year, is already working on her autumn/winter 15 collection and has some exciting health and fitness projects in the pipeline.
