Lynsey Sizer, 35, has to emerge slowly from bed

Few of us feel like leaping out of bed in the morning. But Lynsey Sizer has no choice but to emerge slowly from the covers.

Any
 fast movement - from dashing for the bus to jumping up to answer the 
front door - triggers nausea and dizziness so severe she could lose her 
balance, fall or even pass out.

'I have to move at a snail's pace 
when I get out of bed,' says Lynsey, 35, a company director. 'I place my
 feet on the floor and slowly uncurl so my head is the last thing up. If
 I do it any other way I feel as if I am spinning.

'It's a pain, particularly as I have young children who want their mummy to spring into action in the morning.

'I
 have to think about everything I do - something as simple as sitting on
 the floor to play with them and then getting up can be hazardous. The 
only exercise I can do is swimming, and that has to be a leisurely 
breast stroke rather than front crawl.'

Lynsey's problem is low blood pressure - or hypotension - which affects millions of people.

The symptoms are caused by poor blood flow to the brain - the lack of oxygen leads to dizziness, fainting and nausea.

'Hypotension
 in itself isn't dangerous in the way high blood pressure is - that is, 
it isn't a precursor to, say, heart disease or strokes,' says Dr Nigel 
Durham, a consultant cardiologist at York Hospital.

'What people do 
suffer with are lacerations and injuries - even fractures - as a result 
of falls or blackouts.'

A normal blood pressure reading should be 
120/70 - the upper figure, known as systolic pressure, measures pressure
 in your arteries when your heart contracts and pushes blood around your
 body. If the reading is less than 100, this can trigger symptoms of low
 blood pressure.

These can occur very rapidly, as Lynsey knows. 'A 
few years ago I was at Paddington station, coming back from work, when I
 suddenly felt horrendously dizzy,' she says.

'I could feel 
everything spinning around me. I leant against a wall to steady myself, 
but then slumped to the ground. To make matters worse, a cyclist then 
crashed into me.'

Badly bruised down her leg from the impact, she 
was taken by passers-by to a nearby pharmacy. The staff measured her 
blood pressure and found it was extremely low - 80/50.

After 
drinking water and resting for 45 minutes, the dizziness passed and 
Lynsey was able to make her way home to Maidenhead, Berkshire, where she
 lives with her partner Kevin Broom, 37, a sales director, and their 
children, Lily, five, and three-year-old twins, Owen and Riley.

Low 
blood pressure is triggered by changes in the autonomic nervous system, 
which regulates the rate at which blood is pumped around the body. It 
can be genetic - Lynsey's father has it, too.

Other causes include 
dehydration and vigorous exercise. This is because when we lose water - 
through not drinking enough or sweating - the blood loses volume and 
becomes more concentrated. Pressure is lowered, as it takes longer for 
thicker blood to pump around the body.

Surprisingly, taking 
medication for high blood pressure - a condition that affects 16 million
 adults - can also trigger the symptoms of low blood pressure.

'When 
someone who is being treated with very high blood pressure starts 
getting readings that are normal, the swing seems to cause them to feel 
light-headed and dizzy, so we have to manage their medication 
carefully,' says Dr Glynn Thomas, a cardiologist at the Bristol Heart 
Institute.

Other medication, including anti-depressants, can also cause low blood pressure.

Some
 people get it only after changing positions, such as when standing up -
 a condition known as postural or orthostatic hypotension. When they 
stand, gravity sends blood to the legs and away from the brain. The 
heart rate increases and blood vessels tighten, causing a 'head rush'.

Symptoms should last only a few seconds, while the blood pressure readjusts to the body's new position.

Low
 blood pressure can also occur after eating, known as postprandial 
hypotension. This is more common in older people, particularly if they 
have diabetes or, ironically, high blood pressure.

A lot of blood is
 needed in the intestine for digestion. So, if the heart rate doesn't 
increase to maintain blood pressure, it drops.

Some experience 
symptoms after standing for long periods. This tends to affect children 
and young adults, though it is unclear why.

Whatever form, hypo- 
tension can seriously interfere with day-to-day life. Megan Fell, 26, a 
marketing officer from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, had to miss 
surgery on her jaw because of it.

'For a few years, I've suffered 
with dizzy spells, sickness and black spots in front of my eyes if I 
move too quickly or stand for a long time,' she says.

The surgery 
was to fix a painful joint disorder - cartilage in her mouth had been 
displaced after she opened her mouth too widely to eat a burger.

This
 left it painful to eat, talk or even smile. Megan says: 'They wheeled 
me down to surgery and did the pre-op tests. But when they took my blood
 pressure it was too low  - the heart wasn't pumping blood around my 
body quickly enough.'

The surgery took place several months later, 
when her blood pressure had reached a safe level to operate. She 
achieved this partly by drinking lots of water.

Lynsey's low blood 
pressure was  identified by doctors at the age of nine, though no 
treatment was given. But her symptoms became especially acute when she 
was pregnant with Lily.

'I was vomiting up to ten times a day,' she says. 'I was put on salt tablets for around five months, which helped a bit.'

Salt
 causes water to be absorbed into the blood, increasing its volume and 
so raising blood pressure - which is why people with high blood pressure
 are told to limit their intake.

Drugs such as Midodrine are 
occasionally prescribed by specialists to increase blood volume or to 
narrow the arteries - doing this means there is more blood flowing 
through a smaller space, helping maintain blood pressure. However, the 
main advice is lifestyle changes.

These include simple steps such as
 avoiding sudden movements, and stretching or crossing and uncrossing 
the legs before standing up to prevent blood from pooling in the legs.

Compression
 stoc-kings can also make a difference, says Dr  Thomas. They provide 
extra pressure to the feet and legs, forcing blood back into the 
abdomen, where it can move freely to the brain.

Patients should also 
avoid caffeine at night, and limit their alcohol intake to prevent 
dehydration. And some may need to add more salt to their diet, says Dr 
Thomas. But this should be done only on a doctor's advice, as overdoing 
it can raise blood pressure.

If you think you have low blood pressure, see your GP. You may be given a 24-hour blood pressure monitor to aid diagnosis.

For
 Lynsey, anticipation is the key. 'I know what my triggers are, so I do 
my best to avoid things that will cause problems, though I feel a bit 
silly sometimes when people see me moving around in slow motion,' she 
says.

'The other day, when everyone was rushing for the train home 
from work, I was meandering along. I'd rather wait for the next train - 
it's better than falling down because I feel so dizzy.'
