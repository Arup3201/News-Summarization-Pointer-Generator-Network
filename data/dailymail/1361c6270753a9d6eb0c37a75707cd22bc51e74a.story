A Florida drug court judge is headed for rehab herself after an erratic performance at the bench last week.

Broward County Court judge Gisele Pollack, 55,  resided over the court for an hour and a half before abruptly walking out and ending the Tuesday's court session.

Audio of the incident recorded Pollack telling defendants they have to get clean in a slurred voice.

Addiction: The judge has made no secret of her struggles with drugs and alcohol

'You have to be warned... being clean...' she mumbled to a defendant.

'What?' said the defendant, confused.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, she was later seen yelling at her judicial assistant, demanding that her car keys be returned.

Treatment program: Judge Pollack established the Broward County misdemeanor drug court to help people addicted to drugs avoid criminal records

Pollack did not appear in court Wednesday, but returned to work Thursday where she did not address the incident but told a packed court of graduates of the misdemeanor drug court program that they must 'remain vigilant.'

She told Local 10 Thursday that she is suffering from depression.

'I have some health issues,' she said. 'I’m going into treatment for them. I have two weeks off starting [Friday]. I’m going to be in an intense outpatient program.''I'm a good judge and I'm going to ask you to please work with me,' she said.Pollack, who has never made a secret of her past alcohol and drug abuse problems, was elected to the bench in 2004.A year later, she established the misdemeanor drug court. 'Defendants prepared to go through a treatment program and six months worth of testing, supervision and staying clean would have the charges against them dismissed,' Pollack has said of the program.Attorney Eric Schwartzreich, who is advising Pollack after Tuesday's breakdown, says the judge has had issues in her personal life recently.

Personal issues: Pollack has recently lost her mother and her son is reportedly seriously ill

'She’s had some severe personal tragedy in her life,' Schwartzreich told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Her mother recently passed away, and they were very close. It’s been really devastating for her.'

According to News 10, Pollack's son is suffering a serious illness, which could also have served to tip her over the edge.

Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, a longtime friend of Pollack's, says he hopes people will be accepting of her struggle.

'If this causes the people to not have faith and not have trust in what goes on in that drug courtroom, then she will have to step aside,' he said. 'My hope is is people will wrap their ever-loving arms around Judge Pollack just as she has wrapped her arms around thousands of people.'
