A sex-trafficking case that has already featured several prostitutes taking the stand to defend their pimps drew to a close on Thursday when the court heard summations.

The defense lawyer for the father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr., told the court that many woman would die for the kind of lifestyle that the hookers had.

‘I'm trying to find a job myself that pays me $10,000 a week,’ said defense lawyer Howard Greenberg who is representing George Snr.

Father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr. have pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and money laundering charges

Howard Greenberg, defense lawyer for the father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr., told the court that many woman would die for the kind of lifestyle that the hookers had

He reminded the court that the five women were provided with homes, cars and even four years maternity leave, reports the New York Post.

‘The girls wanted for nothing,’ he told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz, who will render a verdict in the non-jury trial.

The women say they were one big happy family and enjoyed a comfortable suburban life as ‘wife-in-laws’ in Pennsylvania. At night, they commuted to work in Manhattan.

But prosecutors say the women were coerced into prostitution by a father-and-son team that threatened them with beatings, withheld money and referred to them as animals.

‘If those threats had been real… there would have been medical records stacked a mile high,’ said Junior's lawyer, David Epstein.

Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr. have pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking, money laundering and other charges.

Prosecutors say the women made as much as $500,000 a year for the Georges but got little money themselves.

Desiree Ellis, one of the prostitutes told a Manhattan Courtroom last week that she and Vincent George Sr would get over their big fights: 'we kissed, we made up, we had a love session.'

'He's a teddy bear!' she testified.

'We were happy,' she said of their 'family' style life where the three self-proclaimed prostitutes who are testifying in the case lived alongside the father-son pimp pair.

Ellis testified how she and fellow prostitutes Danielle Geissler and Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, all tried to continue their 'happy' lifestyle while the two Vincents were in jail on sex trafficking and prostitution promotion charges.

They really missed the younger Vincent, who they lovingly called 'Ko', on Memorial Day when they had a barbeque because that was 'not really our department. The grill man is Junior...We were pretty unsuccessful there.'

She said that one of the problems that came up both during and after the alleged pimps were arrested was the division of their time among the women.

'When you have one person who can’t split into five different directions, you get a little jealous,' she said.

Vincent George, 55, and his son Vincent Georg Jr, 35, have been charged with money laundering and sex trafficking for allegedly forcing five young women into prostitution, and then beating them and withholding money from them.

However, self-proclaimed prostitutes Danielle Geissler, 31, and 26-year-old Heather Keith painted a far rosier picture of their relationship with the alleged pimps in their testimonies last Tuesday.

The women gushed about their cars, furnished homes, refrigerators filled with food, luxury ski and beach vacations, as well as a fully paid four-year maternity leave for Geissler.

'Did anyone named George force you to become a ho?' blunt defense lawyer Greenberg asked Keith, who replied 'No,' according to the New York Post.

Taking the stand to a packed Manhattan courtroom last Tuesday, Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit, described George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' said that she was in love with him and praised him for being a good father to their 8-year-old daughter.

The 31-year-old 'lady of the night’ went on to boast about all the material fringe benefits that came with their illicit lifestyle, telling the court that each of the women in the Georges' harem had their own houses and cars, including her 1999 BMW and 1995 Nissan Maxima.

She also shared with the courtroom that the Georges would take them on 'fabulous’ vacations to Florida and Vermont.

While the prosecution alleged that the father-son pimps had coerced the five women into selling their bodies for profit, threatened them and treated them like sex war horses, Geissler insisted that they all got along very well.

'We all took care of each other,' she said, adding that the women jokingly called one another 'wife-in-laws' and 'b****es.'

At one point during the proceedings, Keith was questioned about a tattoo of a bar code on her neck below George Jr's street name, ‘King Kobe.'

The prosecution claimed that the body art served as evidence that the alleged pimps treated the women like their property, but the 26-year-old, who is 8-months-pregnant with another man’s baby - insisted that the tattoo was her own choice.

'It was my way to show him that I cared about him, that I loved him,' she said.

In her testimony, Geissler, who worked for George Jr from age 18, conceded that life with her ‘sugar daddy’ was not without its low points.

Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, defended the two men for whom she worked

‘We slapped each other around sometimes but never over work or staying in the life,' she said, clarifying that things would at times turn violent when she was not sexually satisfied.

'If I didn't get it, I'd hate the world,' she added, according to the New York Daily News.

The suspected sex traffickers were arrested last year for allegedly using a music recording company and livery cab service to launder money from the prostitution ring.

The five blondes from Pennsylvania would drive into New York City and work eight-hour shifts, turning tricks for $300 each in the backseat of clients' cars or posh Manhattan hotel rooms, according to testimony.

The prosecution’s case against the father and son includes hundreds of hours of profanity-filled phone conversations between the alleged pimps and their employees.

On one call, the younger George could be heard threatening to beat one of the prostitutes if she fails to get him money or check in every two hours.

The good life: Geissler testified that her pimps treated her and the other women well, furnishing them with houses, cars, fully stocked refrigerators, and even taking them on ski and beach vacations

Geissler, however, said on the witness stand that she never took George Jr's threats seriously and kept the money she made, according to the New York Times.

She also revealed that after his arrest, the 35-year-old suspect proposed marriage to her and three of her colleagues, and even suggested they all move to Africa where they could legally marry.

The Georges' defense team do not deny that the men were promoting prostitution, but they are fighting the sex trafficking charges, which could land their clients behind bars for up to 25 years, if convicted.

‘The women, simply put, worked as hos
because they wanted to,’ Greenberg said.’ Of course they're promoting 
prostitutes ... what's the big deal?’

Wednesday, the procession of 'happy hookers' continued in Manhattan,

With a smile on her face, Ellis bragged about her five-bedroom houses and access to George Jr's cars and cash.

‘I didn’t have a desire to change anything about my life,’ Ellis testified.
