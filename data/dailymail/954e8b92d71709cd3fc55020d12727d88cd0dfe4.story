Ever wondered why cat urine is so pungent, or what causes felines to react so strongly to catnip? You’re not alone.

Now a video reveals the answers - explaining how the psychoactive plant used in catnip works as well as revealing how litter is able to absorb the smell of the urine and clump faeces together.

‘One of the finest joys for cat owners is the feline insanity that comes from catnip,’ said the expert from the American Chemical Society.

High: The video explained that catnip is made from a plant called nepeta cataria pictured). Its psychoactive quality comes from a compound known as nepetalactone, which binds to the olfactory receptors in a cat’s nose. This compound triggers a neurological response, similar to how cats react to sexual pheromones

Its high can last between 10 minutes to an hour, and around 70 per cent of cats are affected by the treat.

The video explained that catnip is made from a plant called nepeta cataria, closely related to mint and, as a result, is often called catmint.

The surprisingly complex chemistry of at litter is explained next. 

Cat urine gets its unique smell from a compound called felinine.

Cat urine gets its unique smell from a compound called felinine. Felinine is broken down into a sulphur called MMB, and male cats use MMB as a pheromone to let females know they are ready to mate. The scientists explain that kitty litter absorbs this smell using clay minerals known as Fuller’s Earth

Bacteria in cat faeces typically converts uric acid into ammonia, which gives the urine its smell. Fuller’s Earth absorbs water from the urine that reacts with the ammonia to create a series of other acids. Artificial scents are typically used in the litter to counteract these smells, and silica gels are also added to absorb urine

These minerals were originally used to clean up oil on factory floors, and works as a partial deodorant.

Internet users believe that a quirk of feline psychology means they will sit in circles because they identify it as new territory that requires protecting. It’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes, carrier bags or cupboards

A group of cat owners claims to have found a foolproof way to get cats to do their bidding: simply by drawing a circle on the floor.

The cat, they say, instinctively feels compelled to go and sit inside it.

According to the theory, cats find circles or similar shapes on the ground irresistible. So if you mark one out - around 2ft (0.6 metres) across -  using chalk, string, masking tape or flex, a cat will enter the circle and refuse to leave. 

The reason behind this phenomenon, however, is unknown. 

It’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes, carrier bags or cupboards - and equally like perching on high spots where they can keep an eye on the world. 

It’s also established that they have favourite spots in the home.

Animal behaviour expert Professor Daniel Mills told MailOnline cats could be attracted to circles if they formed a barrier, for instance, if they were made of a curled-up draught excluder, tea towels or a row of socks.

‘Low barriers can give a cat a sense of security because the cat can cower down,’ says the Lincoln University academic. 

‘If you take a cat to the vet and it is put in an unfamiliar cage, it will often sit in a litter tray if there is one inside the cage.

‘The probable reason is that the sides of the tray are raised and they can get their eyes below the level. They don’t realise that their ears are sticking up.’

That could explain the lure of a raised circle, but not a two- dimensional mark on the floor. 

Artificial scents are typically used in the litter to counteract these smells, and silica gels are also included to absorb urine.

Calcium bentonite is added to create what the video calls ‘litter clump’, which, as the name suggests, it clumps faeces together to make it easier to find and remove from the tray.

And when it comes to marking their territory, glands in a cat’s face, tails, paws and lower back are used to rub against objects.

This is also used to establish and feel familiarity with objects in the home.

For example, when cats rub up against a person, they are showing affection while telling other cats that the person belongs to them. 

The video is part of a series, created by ACS, called Reactions.
