A humble tea taster is now part of a select group of talented A-listers.

Joining the upper echelons of those whose assets are insured - among them Madonna's breasts, Heidi Klum's legs, Keith Richard's hands and Julia Roberts' smile – is Sebastian Michaelis.

The 32-year-old  is to have his tastebuds insured for by British tea brand Tetley for £1million.

Sebastian Michaelis is 'flattered' that he's now in the same league as Hollywood A-listers Madonna, Heidi Klum and Julia Roberts. Tetley has insured the tea blender's tongue for £1m 

'It's very flattering of course', Mr Michaelis said to MailOnline Food of his new status.

'Although my tongue is a little less glamorous than Heidi's legs or Julia's smile.

'I usually drink my tea piping hot, so may have to be extra careful now and leave it to cool a while.'

There are 1,500 different varieties of tea in the world and the palate of Mr Michaelis is so refined, he can taste and grade any single one in just 15 seconds. 

His taste buds have distinguished more than 250,000 blends of tea during his nine-year career at Tetley.

Years spent touring tea gardens from Africa to India has seen the master tea blender develop, hone and refine his sense of taste.

It takes five or more years of tasting hundreds of teas a week to build a good vocabulary of the countless different flavours,' Mr Michaelis explained.

Expensive assets: Heidi Klum's legs are covered for £1.2m

'Some teas have very unlikely tastes. A well-made Assam tea will often have a raspberry jam flavor and you even get a strong taste Calpol on some Sri Lankan teas.

'Blending tea, like blending whisky or champagne, is a fine art. First I examine and grade the colour, size and density of the leaf. 

'Then I assess the brew's purity of colour (its sparkle), the weight of the tea in the mouth (its body) and the overall liveliness of the tea on the palate (its zing).'

As it's his job to drink tea, does he hate the taste by the time he's finished? Or does he still like drinking tea?

'I still drink loads of tea even at the end of a long day,' he continued.

'Tasting tea is different from drinking it, as I have to slurp it off a soup spoon and then spit it out.

1) The tea should be made with boiling water ­and only once-boiled water with a low mineral content if possible. This is because reboiling reduces oxygen levels and affects the taste, whilst water with a low mineral content allows the tea notes to come through better.

2) If you're making black tea, stand by the kettle to ensure you pour as soon as it's boiled. Black tea tastes best when brewed in water as close to boiling point as possible. That's why your cuppa may taste different on a plane. In the reduced pressure environment, the boiling point is lowered to 90°.

3) But if you're making green tea, allow the kettle to cool for up to two minutes. This will make sure that your tea doesn't over-infuse and develop a bitter taste. Green teas are more delicate after all.

4) When using a tea bag in a cup, always add your milk after the water, otherwise the milk will cool the water down and hinder the all important infusion process. If using a teapot, try adding the milk to the cup first. This traditional technique stopped the delicate porcelain cups from cracking.

5) Leave the bag in for at least two minutes to provide sufficient time to let the flavour of the tea to infuse. This is more of a guideline though; the perfect brew is down to personal preference. But do not poke or prod the bag while it is infusing ­ be patient and let the process happen naturally!

6) After removing the bag, leave the brew to cool down for around two-three minutes. As the temperature reduces, the flavours will develop for a better quality taste
