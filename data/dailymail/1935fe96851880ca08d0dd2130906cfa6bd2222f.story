It has long been thought of as an ode to the young daughter of late U.S. president John F. Kennedy.

But now, Neil Diamond has revealed the true inspiration behind his 1969 song 'Sweet Caroline'.

The 73-year-old star, who rose to fame in the sixties, said the soft rock track was a love song for his then-wife Marcia Murphey - but he needed a three-syllable name for the chorus.

Singer-songwriter: Diamond (pictured) explained: 'The song was about my wife at the time - her name was Marcia - and I couldn't get a "Marcia" rhyme. Sweet Caroline - yes! That was it. And that's what it's been'

Speaking to Today, he explained he knew of Caroline Kennedy, then aged 11, at the time, but said: 'I was writing a song in Memphis, Tennessee, for a session. I needed a three-syllable name.

'The song was about my wife at the time - her name was Marcia - and I couldn't get a "Marcia" rhyme. Sweet Caroline - yes! That was it. And that's what it's been.'

However, Diamond, who has sold over 125 million records globally, did not take back his previous comments that the young Miss Kennedy was at least partly influential toward the song.

In 2007, the singer-songwriter revealed he was a struggling musician in the sixties when an 'innocent, wonderful' photo of the president's daughter in a magazine caught his eye.

Where it began, I can't begin to know it, But then I know it's growing strong, Was in the spring, And spring became a summer, Who'd believe you'd come along

Hands, Touching hands, Reaching out, Touching me, Touching you

Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, I've been inclined, To believe they never would, But now I...

...look at the night, And it don't seem so lonely, We fill it up with only two, And when I hurt, Hurting runs off my shoulders, How can I hurt when holding you?

Warm, Touching warm, Reaching out, Touching me, Touching you

Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, I've been inclined, To believe they never would, Oh, no, no

Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, Sweet Caroline, I believe they never could, Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, Sweet Caroline...

'It was a picture of a little girl dressed to the nines in her riding gear, next to her pony,' he said at the time. 'It was such an innocent, wonderful picture, I immediately felt there was a song in there.'

Years later, holed up in a Memphis hotel, Diamond reportedly wrote the words and music to 'Sweet Caroline' in less an hour, before releasing it on September 16, 1969, as a single.

It has since become a staple track - particularly at sporting events - and had sold a staggering 1,745,000 digital downloads as of April 2013.

In 2007, Diamond, who was born in Brooklyn, New York, performed the song to Miss Kennedy at her 50th birthday celebrations.

And last year, he announced that he would donate all royalties since the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013, to One Fund Boston to help those most affected by the attacks.

The singer appeared on the TV show to promote his first album release in six years, 'Melody Road', which was launched on October 21 by Capitol Records and is his 32nd studio album to date.

'I was a nervous wreck going into this new album,' Diamond said. 'I had 40 or almost 50 years of songwriting to match up to.'

When asked if he is planning to release any more albums in the future, he added: 'I hope so, I hope so, I mean I'm still writing and that's a good clue.'

Diamond had two sons, Jesse and Micha, with Miss Murphey before they divorced in the mid-nineties. He had earlier had two daughters, Marjorie and Elyn, with his first wife Jaye Posner. 

The singer married his third wife, Katie McNeil, in Los Angeles in April 2012.
