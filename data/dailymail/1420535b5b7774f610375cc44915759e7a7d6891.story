Amazon sold more than three million items last Monday, making it the firm’s busiest day ever.

The first Monday in December has earned the nickname ‘Cyber Monday’ as it is the busiest day for internet shoppers keen to ensure their order arrives in time for Christmas.

Amazon’s British arm beat last year’s Cyber Monday total of 2.3million items, as the Christmas rush finally got started.

The online retailer’s bestseller was its own Kindle e-reader, which costs £89.

Christopher North, managing director of Amazon.co.uk, said: ‘This year, Cyber Monday saw the most items ever ordered in a single day with Kindle being the stand-out product.’

Christmas web sales are expected to rise 15 per cent this year, accounting for £7.75billion in sales.

But there was also some relief for traditional retailers as millions of shoppers hit the High Street this weekend.

It comes as chains across Britain slash their prices to lure Christmas shoppers into their stores, with many starting ‘panic sales’ long before Boxing Day.

Top gadget: Kindle e-readers were the best-selling product that shoppers snapped up

More than 1.5million shoppers spent £180million in Central London on Saturday alone, according to the New West End Company, which represents around 600 traders in Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street.

The company said it expected a further £100million to be spent yesterday (sun), and said technology and winter fashion had proved to be the best sellers.

Chief executive Richard Dickinson said: ‘Based on past experience we were confident that despite the slow start to seasonal spending, shoppers would get the tills ringing over the next two weeks, but this weekend has exceeded expectations.’

Capital Shopping Centres, which operates 14 malls across Britain, including the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Thurrock, said more than eight million shoppers had visited its malls in the last week.

Retail sales figures for November, out on Thursday, are expected to show that consumers have been forced to economise.

High inflation has forced up the price of food, leaving shoppers with less money in their pockets.

Unseasonably warm weather in October and November also meant there was low demand for winter fashion until the last two weeks.

Ongoing fears of a double dip recession and the possible collapse of the Eurozone are also expected to have hit High Street sales.

Forecaster Capital Economics suggested there would be a last-minute rush for presents, but that it would probably lead to a very weak start to spending in the New Year.

The success of e-readers, which can store between 1,000 and 10,000 e-books, has bucked the trend for dwindling sales figures.

Kindle’s maker Amazon reported earlier this year that it was selling 105 e-books for every 100 printed books.

The gadget is now facing increased competition from rivals Kobo, Sony and Apple’ s iPad.
