It was only in August that iconic luxury department store Harrods opened the doors to its much-hyped gender-neutral toy department.

The multi-million pound re-design of the 15 year-old department was the famous store's way of entering the new era with a Toy Kingdom being grouped by theme and not gender.

However, Harrods is currently at the centre of a Twitter storm after one user uploaded a photo suggesting that the store hasn't completely revoked gender marketing.

Juxtaposition: Feminist Kystina Meens uploaded this photo from the 'gender neutral' section of Harrods' Toy Kingdom and expressed her shock

Krystina Meens, a TV freelance journalist and researcher from London, posted an image on Twitter of two children's books placed next to each other in the department store.

On the left, a book entitled: 'How to be gorgeous: Smart ways to look and feel fabulous' features a girl on the cover and on the right a book illustrated with a young boy says: 'How to be clever: Smart ways to get smarter'.

The self-proclaimed 'opinionated 
feminist' told MailOnline: 'Yesterday evening I was
looking in the impressive new gender-neutral section of Harrods and two books 
caught my eye.

'It was the juxtaposition of the two books on the shelf that struck me.'

Krystina uploaded a photo of the 
books with the caption: 'Shocked and appalled at this in @harrods 
children's reading room. Please rt to get these sexist books off the 
shelf.'

Removed: The department store assured their Twitter followers that the books had been removed and apologised for any offence caused following Krystina's (L) tweets

Shocked: Krystina uploaded a photo of the books with the caption: 'Shocked and appalled at this in @harrods children's reading room. Please rt to get these sexist books off the shelf'

'Thank god little girls can learn "how to look stylish in five minutes flat" whilst boys learn "incredible ways to remember things" @harrods'

She also added: 'smart one shouldn't be removed- it just shouldn't only have a boy on the front cover'.

Krystina, who has worked on feminist 
issues in the past, immediately approached a member of the sales team who admitted 
she was equally 'appalled' and put her in contact with the manager.

'The manager was embarrassed and blamed WH Smith as the books were part of their concession there.

'I didn't want to complain again but 
there were more books next to them of a similar nature. One for girls 
had tips on how to change bed sheets, which 12-year-old girl wants to 
change bedsheets?' said Krystina.

Hours
after 25-year-old Krystina posted her photo, more than 400 people had 
retweeted her request to get the books removed from shelves.

This morning, Harrods tweeted saying: 'Good Morning! Please be advised that the children's books that many of you have tweeted us about have been removed from our shelves...'

They then added: 'We would like to apologise for any offence caused and assure you all that these books will no longer be sold at #Harrods.'

Krystina, who used to work at the department store, says she wasn't surprised by the public support she gained because she believes that it is an issue that strikes a nerve with many.

She added: 'When I have a daughter, I hope I can teach her more than how to get ready in ten minutes flat.'

MailOnline has contacted Harrods for a comment.
