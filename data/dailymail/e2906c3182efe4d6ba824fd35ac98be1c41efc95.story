Everton's youngsters showed the senior team how it's done with a comprehensive 5-0 win over local rivals Liverpool on Saturday afternoon.

The Toffees' Under 18 side were comfortable winners at Finch Farm as a brace from Calum Dyson and goals from Harry Charsley, Jack Bainbridge and Liam Walsh sealed victory.

The result  helped Paul Tait's side cement second place in the North Group of the Under 18 Premier League, although third-placed Manchester United do have three games in hand.

After the game Tait told evertonfc.com: 'I'm delighted.'From the first minute, we set the tone for the game. The football was different class in the first half.

'In truth, it could have been seven, eight or nine. But that was the pleasing thing, that we got the five goals.

'Sometimes if you dominate possession, at any level, not just at academy level, sometimes you're not going anywhere and you're not threatening the goal. But that was the real plus point today, that we were so clinical.'
