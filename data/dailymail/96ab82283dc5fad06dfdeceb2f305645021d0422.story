Brendan Rodgers will be a keen observer when the shootout between Liverpool’s guns starts in Sao Paolo.

Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have thrived under Rodgers’ guidance last season, scoring 51 goals in the Barclays Premier League, but there will be no love lost this evening when Uruguay and England attempt to save their World Cup dreams.

When they come face-to-face, there will be nothing other than a cursory handshake.

Suarez and Sturridge would not be classed as friends and they have regularly bickered on the pitch when one has taken on a shot rather than passing to the other.

Rodgers has never described them as being a natural partnership, believing they are two forwards who have slotted into a system and he is intrigued to see which man will cope best with the high-pressure demands.

‘They’re both different,’ Rodgers explained. ‘They are two different players with two different sets of qualities.

'Luis has got a lot more experience (at international level). I’m just interested to see how Daniel copes.

‘I think the key with him is playing in the right position. He can play out of position in certain situations and certain games. The problem you have at that level is you don’t get a second chance.

‘He is best through the middle. Rooney is also best through the middle, maybe dropping in, so it’s looking at where his strengths are as a player. Suarez can play in a number of positions so it’ll be fascinating to see the two goalscorers.’

And is the rivalry between them healthy?

Rodgers replied: “Of course – all strikers want to be the number nine; they want to finish as top scorer. They want to be the kings.’
