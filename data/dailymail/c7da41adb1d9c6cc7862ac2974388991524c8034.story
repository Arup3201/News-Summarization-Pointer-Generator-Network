A senator took an unorthodox approach to appeal to voters on Saturday as she helped college students do keg stands at a football game.

Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu, who is up for re-election, joined in the wild antics during a Louisiana State University Tigers game against Mississippi State University's Bulldogs. 

The 58-year-old senator, who attended LSU, joined those tailgating in the parking lot and even helped one fraternity brother, who was lifted upside down on the keg, by holding the nozzle to let him chug beer.

Ms Landrieu, who is up for re-election against Republican Representative Bill Cassidy, appeared to be popular among students, who chanted: 'Mary! Mary!', NBC reported.

She did not take part in her own keg stand challenge.  

Her rival Rep. Cassidy stopped by the party soon after but didn't appear to have taken part in any  keg stand antics.

The images of the keg-stand party popped up on Twitter on Saturday. One was accompanied by the caption: 'Mary Landrieu wants your vote - and will help you keg-stand in order to get it.'

The senator's show of school spirit didn't much help the final score with LSU losing 34-29 to the MSU Bulldogs.  

Ms Landrieu, who is married with two children, graduated from LSU in 1977 and was a member of  the Delta Gamma sorority. 

For the uninitiated, a keg stand is a drinking game popular at student parties where an individual does a handstand, often with help of bystanders, to drink for as long as possible from the beer tap on the keg. 

MailOnline was awaiting comment today from Landrieu's representative on Monday.
