AC Milan are keen on taking Joel Campbell on loan if negotiations develop with Arsenal over Mario Balotelli.

Campbell impressed on loan at Olympiakos and has continued his form with Costa Rica in the World Cup.

Milan want Balotelli out and have interest from Monaco but hope Arsenal follow up initial interest and like the idea of a deal for fleet-footed Campbell in the process.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was taking a keen interest in Mario Mandzukic's return for Croatia last night but is also among the suitors for Alexis Sanchez of Barcelona.

Sanchez has attracted interest from Juventus, Liverpool and Manchester United also but their is a growing belief he fancies a move to Atletico Madrid who made enquiries last week.

Barcelona are already losing Victor Valdes, Carles Puyol and Xavi Hernandez while Dani Alves could yet join PSG. They have an interest in Gonzalo Higuain at Napoli but have yet to make a bid.

Juventus willing to sell Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba

Juventus, as well as wanting Romelu Lukaku, have made a £12million opening bid for Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata in what is seen as a precursor to Arturo Vidal going the other way in a separate deal.

Madrid want £25m and a buy-back clause on coveted striker Morata while Juventus are understood to be willing to sell Vidal and Paul Pogba despite protestations that both are key figures at the club.

There is no doubt both are influential players but business-savvy Juventus believe this summer may be the best time to cash in on both for optimum price.

Vidal was one of Chile's heroes against Spain on Wednesday night and is highly regarded across Europe. Madrid have been asked to stump up £40m for the 27-year-old while Paris St Germain remain firm favourites for Pogba.

The former Manchester United midfielder looks more accomplished on every performance and, while there will be clubs here who want to take him, PSG have the resources and players such as Marco Verratti and Lucas Moura to be offered as part of any £50m deal.

Morata's departure from Madrid meanwhile will signal their search for another striker. There is little doubt that they will make an attempt to bid for Luis Suarez at Liverpool but they also want a different style of forward who can give them another option from the bench.

West Ham offered Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero

West Ham have been offered Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero from Monarcas Morelia but are also considering highly-rated Real Mallorca winger Marco Asensio.

The 24-year-old Montero was a target in recent seasons for Wigan, Cardiff and Swansea and his club have had further enquiries from Juventus and Napoli. At £5million he represents good value, however, Asensio is seen as one of the brightest young talents in Spain.

Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona have all watched him closely and Mallorca initially signed him ahead of Madrid. The 18-year-old is fast and skilful and has an affordable buy-out clause understood to be around £3m but that is due to more than double next year.

The big clubs are maintaining an interest but know they have other wingers who would block his path of progression at this stage.

Everton make £8million bid for Croatia's Ivan Perisic

Everton are understood to have placed an £8million bid for Ivan Perisic at Wolfsburg. The Croatian starred again for his national side in their comfortable win over Cameroon on Wednesday night and topped his performance with an impressive goal.

That may not help Everton though if Wolfsburg decide to let his performances dictate an auction. They already have interest gathering in Brazilian midfielder Luiz Gustavo and Swiss international left-back Ricardo Rodriguez and their valuations are suitably prohibitive to discourage time wasters.

Gustavo has been asked about by Barcelona, United, Arsenal and Chelsea but will cost a minimum £28million and Liverpool target Rodriguez will be £21m as quoted to Fiorentina this week. If that pattern is anything to go by then Everton may find themselves priced out of a deal.

Danny Ings off to Germany?

Danny Ings is attracting attention from Newcastle and Everton as they consider alternatives to their forward targets. However, the more intriguing interest is coming from the Bundesliga where Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg have taken note of his goalscoring exploits.

The 21-year-old has one year left on contract and Burnley insist he will not be sold this summer yet foreign sides recognise he would cost less in compensation if he were to join them and they will be keen observers of his performances in the Premier League next season.

Ings was released by Southampton as a teenager but was picked up by Bournemouth before joining Burnley for just over £1m in 2011. He won Championship Player of the Year at Football League awards and scored 26 goals in 45 games last season.

Crsytal Palace in talks with Chris Kettings

Crystal Palace are discussing a deal for former Blackpool goalkeeper Chris Kettings. The 21-year-old free agent started his career at Manchester City before joining Blackpool in 2007 and had subsequent loan spells at Birmingham, Morecambe and York City. He will provide cover for Julian Speroni and Wayne Hennessey.

Stoke offered Livorno striker Paulinho

Stoke have been offered 28-year-old Livorno striker Paulinho. Brazilian-born but with an Italian passport, Livorno president Aldo Spinelli said: 'I can confirm a proposal from Al Jazira. They made a very serious offer and we're talking about it to see if we can find an agreement.'

Talking to Gazzetta dello Sport, he added: 'What I can say is that the negotiations have started and in the coming hours we will know more about this, with everything still open, and talk to the player to work out the best opportunity. Al Jazira have already spoken with Paulinho, but Stoke City also want him and there are also a couple of other English clubs.'

The 28-year-old impressed in Serie A last season and scored 15 times in 35 games, also providing six assists for his team-mates, yet Stoke ideally want younger players and maintain an interest in signing 18-year-old Barcelona winger Adama Traore on loan.

PSG admit defeat in Eden Hazard pursuit

Laurent Blanc has seemingly conceded defeat in his efforts to prise Eden Hazard from Chelsea. French champions PSG were poised to offer £61m for the former Lille playmaker but Jose Mourinho insisted they would be wasting their time and has signalled discussions over a new contract for the Belgian.

Blanc said: 'Hazard is a top player, but I think Chelsea want to keep him. A lot of players are going to be mentioned, but we have already got our priority, David Luiz.'

Doncaster's Chris Brown in Blackpool move?

Incoming joint-Doncaster owner John Ryan says forward Chris Brown has been offered a deal to sign for Blackburn.

The 29-year-old striker has been with Doncaster since 2011 and scored nine goals in 43 appearances last season.

Lucrative deal: Doncaster face a battle to hold onto Chris Brown who was offered a better wage at Blackburn

Ryan said: 'We have unfortunately lost (Mark) Duffy and Chris Brown as they had to take a 50 per cent wage cut.

'Chris Brown has been offered 10 grand a week by Blackburn, you can't compete with that.'
