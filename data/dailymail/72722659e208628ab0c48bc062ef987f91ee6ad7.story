Charities should stay away from politics and ‘stick to their knitting’, a Tory minister has claimed.

Brooks Newmark, the minister for civil society, criticised charities that ‘stray’ from their remit of ‘helping others’.

In his first major speech since his appointment this summer, Mr Newmark said: ‘We really want to try and keep charities and voluntary groups out of the realms of politics.

‘Some 99.9 per cent do exactly that. When they stray into the realm of politics that is not what they are about and that is not why people give them money.

Stitch-up: Mr Newmark wants charities to concentrate on knitting instead of 'party political' campaigning

The important thing charities should be doing is sticking to their knitting and doing the best they can to promote their agenda, which should be about helping others.’

The comments come after several Tory backbenchers attacked Oxfam earlier this year for opposing benefit cuts and zero-hour contracts, claiming that the organisation’s campaign was too political.

Yesterday Lisa Nandy, Labour’s spokesman for civil society, attacked Mr Newmark’s comments. She also warned that the new Lobbying Act could limit the ability of charities to campaign on the issues of the day.

'It’s his first speech as charities minister, and I think it’s not just patronising but actually deeply offensive – at a time when charities are picking up the pieces from this government’s awful, unfair policies – that their ministers would talk about them in such a dismissive way,’ she said.

Concern: Brooks Newmark insisted he did not want to prevent charities from campaigning generally

‘This comes from a government that hasn’t just introduced the Lobbying Act but has also restricted charities using judicial review, cut legal aid, ramped up employment tribunal fees and clamped down on immigration appeals.

‘What you’re looking at is a government that doesn’t like challenge. That is quite a frightening place for a government to have got itself into.’

Last night Mr Newmark said his comments at a charity conference were intended as a reference to ‘party politics’, adding he did not want to prevent charities from campaigning in general.

He said: ‘Charities, with all their expertise, have an important role to play in helping to shape government policy. While they have the right to campaign they should stay out of the realm of party politics.’

Conservatives have claimed Labour supporters are using charities to run campaigns criticising the Government to help Ed Miliband win the next general election.

Nearly half of Gordon Brown’s Downing Street aides are now working for charities and think-tanks – positions from which they have been accused of mounting a guerrilla war on the Tories.

Eleven out of the 25 special advisers who worked for Mr Brown when he was prime minister in 2009 have taken roles at various organisations, which critics claim are being used as vehicles for a pro-Labour agenda.

Charities are banned by law from giving support or funding to political parties, but in 2008 Mr Brown tweaked the rules so they could join political campaigns.

The list of Mr Brown’s former colleagues now working in the charity sector includes Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save the Children UK.

The charity was heavily criticised two years ago after it launched an appeal to help children in Britain for the first time in its history. Tory MPs claimed it was a political move against the Coalition government.
