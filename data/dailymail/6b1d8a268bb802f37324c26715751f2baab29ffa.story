Concerns have been raised over Adam Muema after he left a training session at an NFL Scouting Combine because God told him to

Concerns have been raised over a former San Diego state running back who left a training session at an NFL Scouting Combine on Sunday because God told him to.

Adam Muema has reportedly not been in touch with his San Diego State coaches since he left the session and did not show up to a training camp, scheduled for after the combine.

Muema, the fourth leading rusher in Aztecs history, missed the combine training session, which saw other running backs compete in drills at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, because he said the Lord told him he'd play for the Seattle Seahawks if he took it easy.

He said it was his 'dream' to play for the Super Bowl-winning team.

But he then failed to turn to an offseason 'training base' in Florida, according to U-T San Diego.

A person who is close to the player told the site: 'I have no idea where he is. (San Diego State coaches) have been trying to track him down.'

While he is not believed to have shown up to training, CBSSports.com has reported he did get on a flight to Florida after leaving the combine.

A video producer for the site reportedly saw the player on a flight from Indianapolis to Ft Lauderdale on Monday.

Meanwhile, a tweet posted by a Twitter account apparently set up by the player appeared on Monday which read: 'Yes, you guys are right I am crazy, crazy in love with Jesus it is the sweetest name I know.'

He had not been in touch with his agent or visited the Florida training base by yesterday, CBSSports.com has reported.

According to the U-T San Diego however, Muema did suggest on Sunday he would be keeping a low profile for the foreseeable future.

Lou Farrar, his former coach at Charter Oak High, said: 'At this point, we just hope he's safe.'

Muema explained his curious decision to skip the session in the combine on Sunday in a phone interview from the Indianapolis International Airport as he was returning to the city where he trained for the combine.

He will have another chance to impress NFL teams at San Diego State's pro day next month.

'(God) told me to sit down, be quiet, and enjoy the peace,' he said of his current plan, adding that he communicates with God through numbers.

Muema regularly shares his religious beliefs and quotes the Bible on social media.

In 2013, the running back rushed 256 times for 1,244 yards and 15 touchdowns, U-T San Diego.com reports.

He declared for the draft last month as an early-entry junior and the NFL Draft Advisory Board initially predicted him to be a fourth to seventh-round pick, a source told the news website.

Other players, including Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel, also decided not to throw on Sunday.
