If Russia ordered the assassination of Litvinenko on British soil it could badly damage diplomatic relations

The widow of murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko today welcomed a coroner's pledge to question the secret services over his killing.

Dr Andrew Reid today ruled there should be a full 7/7-style inquest into the death of the 43-year-old from radiation poisoning.

Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said the 
decision was 'very important' to her because it meant the inquest would 
examine allegations that the Russian state was involved in the killing.

If the inquest finds that Russia had ordered the assassination on British soil, it could have huge ramifications on diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Dr Reid, the St Pancras Coroner, also announced he would ask the Metropolitan Police and intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 to carry out further inquiries.

He said he would decide at a later date whether he would hold the inquest himself or ask for a senior judge to be appointed.

Former KGB agent Mr Litvinenko, 43, fell ill shortly after drinking tea during a meeting at a West End hotel with former contacts and died in London's University College Hospital on November 23, 2006.

Prosecutors have named fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the main suspect in his murder, but the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.

Under British law, a dead person's family has 
the right to an inquest into a suspicious death.

This often goes beyond 
the medical cause to examine more widely the circumstances of how the 
death occurred.

An inquest was 
opened and adjourned in 2006, but it has been claimed that said the British Foreign Office and 
police officials tried to discourage Marina from reopening it 
because they feared, respectively, that it would further damage 
relations with Moscow and reduce the already remote prospects for a 
trial.

Last month, Russia said it was prepared to investigate the murder but wanted it to be in a court in their country not in Britain.

A leaked U.S. document also showed a Russian official said shortly after the death they had been tracking the assassins but Britain had stopped it.

Ben Emmerson QC, for Mrs Litvinenko, told the court the full hearing must consider whether it was a state-sanctioned murder - and also look at the role of the British security services.

He said: 'Did Russia murder Litvinenko
is a question that this inquest, if it is going to do anything in the 
public interest, has got to be in a position to answer.

'Did MI5 and MI6 have material in 
their possession which could have saved him and failed in their duties 
is also a question that it must be in a position to answer.

'Finally, it must dispel the insulting
suggestions of suicide and the involvement of the British security 
services that are being raised by Mr Lugovoy as a smokescreen to hide 
his guilt.'

Mr Emmerson said the poisoning of Mr 
Litvinenko using radioactive polonium-210 was a case of 'nuclear 
terrorism on the streets of London'.

The barrister also told the hearing in north London that 97 per cent of the world's legally produced polonium-210 came from a site in Russia.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev insisted during a visit to Moscow by Prime Minister David Cameron last month that suspect Mr Lugovoy - now a Russian MP - would never be extradited to Britain.

Mr Lugovoy, who denies all involvement, suggested through his lawyer today that Mr Litvinenko may have killed himself.

Jessica Simor told the hearing on his behalf: 'The scope should be wide. It should enable and allow the coroner to investigate the relevant issues so as to dispel the numerous allegations of Mr Lugovoy's involvement.

'In particular the inquest should be able to consider all other possibilities, including death by misadventure and suicide.

'We do not accept that there is an indisputable verdict of unlawful killing in this case.'

Neil Garnham QC, for the British Government, argued in favour of a narrower remit for the inquest.

He told the coroner: 'There is simply nothing before you to suggest that the bringing of polonium-210 into this country or its use on Mr Litvinenko was something that any public authority here might have prevented.'

Dr Reid said it seemed 'inconceivable' that Mr Litvinenko, as a former member of the Russian security services who was granted first asylum and then citizenship by the UK, was not 'on the radar' of MI5 or MI6.

Mr Garnham said he could neither confirm nor deny whether the British intelligence services held any relevant documents.

Speaking outside court after the hearing, Mrs Litvinenko said she was pleased the coroner would carry out a broad investigation into the death.

'I was waiting for this almost five years since my husband died. Today I actually received a very important decision,' she said.

'The coroner has said there will be a wide inquest into my husband's death. It will therefore include an investigation into the involvement of the Russian state in his murder, which is exactly what I want.'
