The Liberal Democrats and Tories were tonight locked in a bitter battle for victory in the Eastleigh by-election, knowing that defeat could spell disaster for their leaders.

But following the closure of polling stations at 10pm, the UK Independence Party could be on the brink of pulling off an incredible coup to secure its first ever elected MP.

Lib Dem insiders had thought the Hampshire seat was 'in the bag' but fear voters could desert them in protest at the Lord Rennard scandal.

Voters were going to the polls to choose a successor to disgraced Cabinet minister Chris 
Huhne, who quit after being warned he faces jail for pleading guilty to 
perverting the course of justice.

The Conservative party has issued leaflets using the colours of the UK Independence Party.

In a move seen as a desperate attempt to woo voters who have switched to Ukip, the Tories ditched their traditional blue for purple and yellow on flyers featuring their candidate Maria Hutchings.

Some Conservatives fear they could be beaten by Ukip into third place in Eastleigh - a seat on the Tory target list to secure a Commons majority in 2015.

The
Lib Dem candidate Mike Thornton was battling to see off challenges from 
the Conservatives and the UK Independence Party, who claimed they could be
on course for a historic first Commons win.

Polling stations opened at 7am and 
voters were able to cast their ballot until 10pm. There were 14 candidates 
standing in the seat, where the Lib Dems are defending a 3,864 majority.

After an intense three-week campaign, many local residents have put notices on their doors refusing any more leaflets.

The election has been billed as a must-win for both Nick Clegg and David Cameron to reassure their increasingly anxious party faithful.

And the Tories have named Eastleigh as one of 40 target seats they need to win to secure an overall majority for Mr Cameron.

But
Ukip has built a surge in support in the last week of the campaign, 
with leader Nigel Farage boasting his party was 'coming up on the rails'
and could secure a shock win in the tight three-horse race.

Labour
leader Ed Miliband will also face tough questions if his party fails to
improve on its dismal 9.6 per cent share of the vote secured in 2010, 
with senior party figures warning they are failing to make any progress 
in southern seats like Eastleigh.

party's candidate, comedian John O'Farrell, has been dogged by 
questions about his books which have included jokes about the IRA 
attempt to kill Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War.

'What we have got here is a very exciting three-way marginal. I think this is the toughest by-election to call we have ever seen'

Lib
Dem strategists say a week ago they believed victory was ‘in the bag’ 
but have been thrown off course by claims that the Lib Dem leadership 
turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual misconduct by former chief 
executive Lord Rennard.

‘It
is having an effect,’ said a senior party source. ‘The big danger is 
our people just stay at home, and Tory and Ukip voters turn out.’

Mr Clegg made a brief visit to Eastleigh yesterday, where he boasted that his party's candidate Mike Thornton was ‘on the cusp of a great victory’. He told activists: ‘We can and we will win.’

David Cameron used Twitter today to drum up support for his Tory candidate, Maria Hutchings

Former
Tory leadership challenger David Davis told BBC TV's Daily Politics: 'I
think if we came third it would be a crisis, I think that’s the case, 
and if it’s a close second with Ukip on our tail it will also be 
uncomfortable.

'Let's be 
clear, it's not going to dislodge David Cameron, he’s going to be there 
till the next election, but the simple truth is that it will make things
more uncomfortable in the House of Commons.'

Ukip has grown increasingly confident
that it could beat the Tories, dealing a devastating blow to Mr Cameron
who last month used a long-awaited speech to promise an in-out 
referendum on Britain's EU membership. The speech was in part designed 
to stem the loss of support to Eurosceptic Ukip.

The
PM used his Twitter account to appeal for support in the by-election 
today, telling his 240,000 followers that the Tories have the 'the right
policies on welfare, immigration and the deficit'.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday claimed his 
party was ‘coming up on the rails’ and could overtake both the Liberal 
Democrats and the Tories in Eastleigh.

He
claimed Ukip supporters would vote for his party's candidate Diane 
James ‘in blood’ to express their anger at the bigger parties.

Recent
polls have put Ukip comfortably in third place, behind the Tories in 
second and the Lib Dems ahead with a five point lead.

Some Tories fear that despite a major campaign operation in the Hampshire town they could be pushed into third place by UKIP

The by-election has been billed as a must-win for David Cameron, who is in Latvia for the Northern Future Forum meeting of prime ministers from Nordic and Baltic countries and Britain in Riga

Mr Farage told LBC 97.3: ‘It started off as a two-horse race with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives ahead.

‘Over the course of the last week we have been coming up on the rails. We have almost drawn level with one full day’s campaign to go.

'What we have got here is a very exciting three-way marginal. I think this is the toughest by-election to call we have ever seen.

‘Turnout makes a hell of a difference. People who have said they will vote Ukip will go out and vote for Ukip in blood. We could see a Ukip win,’ he added, although he accepted ‘the odds are against’.
