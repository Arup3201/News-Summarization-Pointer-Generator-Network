Stepping through the front door of East Dagworth Hall is like going on a journey back in time.

The timber-framed building dates from the 15th Century but stands on the site of a far older medieval hall with a very colourful past.

For centuries, Dagworth Hall was a manor house. Then, in the Fifties, it was divided into two homes – East and West Dagworth Hall.

Jeremy and Hannah Steventon-Barnes, the owners of East Dagworth Hall, near Stowmarket in Suffolk, have traced its history to before the Domesday Book in 1086, and the results of their painstaking five-year research are documented on their website, dagworth.steventon-barnes.com.

And the house was seen last summer in the BBC2 series The Great British Story when its presenter, historian Michael Wood, investigated the area as a corner of Anglo-Saxon England.

The first known Dagworth resident was a Saxon called Breme, who farmed a large tract of land much bigger than the plot on which the dozen or so homes that make up the hamlet sit today.

The medieval residents took the place name as their own. A knight called Richard de Dagworth lived at the manor from 1205. It remained in the family name until 1401, with his great-grandson Nicholas (1306 to 1351) among his descendants who lived there.

Features of the property’s past include a mischievous ghost called Malekin, a visit from King John and his Court in 1216, and a character called Valentine Blomfield, born at Dagworth Hall on February 14, 1793, who settled in Australia and gave his estate there the same name.

The Steventon-Barneses have lived in the four-bedroom house for nine years, bringing up their young sons, Zac, ten, Barney, eight, and Theo, six.

Now they have put it up for sale at £399,995 because they are moving to give their growing boys more space. ‘It’s been wonderful to live somewhere with so much history,’ says Jeremy, 42, a network director for BT.

East Dagworth Hall is a quirky house that has undergone few structural changes – and those with a sense of romance could find their spiritual home here.

In the double-height hallway you are immediately struck by the history: the sloping timbers, the odd-shaped windows above the stairs, and the framed portrait of Valentine Blomfield that the Steventon-Barneses managed to track down.

Tudor style: The sitting room in the Grade II listed home has an inglenook fireplace and exposed beams

The hall leads to a cosy family/dining room at the back of the house, complete with an old Aga, which is supplemented by a smaller kitchen overlooking a side garden. There’s also a study converted from a lean-to, from where you can see through to the family room, and a further office in an outbuilding.

However, the most impressive room is the main sitting room, which has a large inglenook with a log-burner, windows with garden views at both ends and exposed overhead beams, including a vast blackened Tudor beam near the fireplace.

Upstairs, the four bedrooms – all different shapes with yet more exposed timbers – are as idiosyncratic as the rest of the house. The master bedroom has a fireplace and enough space to fit an en suite (subject to planning permission, as the house is Grade II listed), though there’s a bathroom on this floor and a shower room downstairs.

Lots of cooking: For the hobby-Heston there is plenty of space to cook - this is just the supplement kitchen

All the upstairs rooms have views over the gardens and countryside. As Jeremy points out, the landscape has remained pretty unscathed for 1,000 years, with little change to the layout of the fields.

East Dagworth Hall’s grounds, bounded by the River Gipping, would be a major draw for a keen gardener. There’s an orchard, a large sunny terrace, roses, honeysuckle in summer, a walled children’s play area, a wild area near the river and a lawned section.

In the nine years Jeremy and Hannah have lived in the hall, they have done some replastering and decorating but no major work.

‘I love the fact that there have been so many people here before us,’ says Hannah, 40. ‘Both my younger sons were born at home. When I had Barney, I remember wondering how many people had been born in this house before him. It gives you a sense of belonging.’
