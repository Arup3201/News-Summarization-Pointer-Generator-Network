Corinna Schumacher is selling the private jet her husband Michael used to fly around the world in for £12million.

The sale - 207 days since his life changed forever in a ski accident in the French Alps - is seen as proof that, whatever the outcome of his rehabilitation may be, he will never be the globetrotter he once was.

Schumacher, 45, lies mute and immobile in a Lausanne clinic in Switzerland with long years of therapy ahead of him as he struggles to get back some of his old life that was shattered when he smashed his head on to rocks on December 29 last year.

Corinna is now offering his grey Falcon 2000EX private jet, capable of carrying eight passengers and flying at 920km/h, for sale. It still has Schumacher's initials on the tailplane.

Germany's Bild newspaper commented: 'The reasons for the sale are obvious: during his active time as a Formula One driver, Schumi jetted between 300 and 400 hours annually with the aircraft around the world.

'Even in his break of three years (2007-2009), he used the Jet for many family vacations with Corinna and the children Mick, 15, and Gina Maria, 17.

'But now everything is different. The world of the Schumachers has changed.'

It was reported at the weekend that Schumacher is continuing to make good progress in the Lausanne clinic following his re-emergence from a medically induced coma last month. 

Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick reported: 'There are signs that Michael will leave the clinic soon and be cared for at home.'

Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him, complete with state of the art machines and a seperate building for carers to live in.

The newspaper reported that a new building with no outside steps has been constructed on the grounds of the mansion. It is thought that this will be used as the long-term care home for Schumacher.

Some experts say that such home-care for a coma patient is unwise.

But with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years.

This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.

Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month following the accident in the French Alps in December.

It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes.

Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks.
