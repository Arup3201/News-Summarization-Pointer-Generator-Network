A new clip of Prince Harry to be screened on TV shows the moment he suffered a health scare during his 124-mile South Pole trek last year.

The footage shows Harry laid low by crippling altitude sickness and exhaustion that forced him to rest for 36 hours wile trekking across the Antarctic.

As doctors check he still has feeling in his limbs, the prince admits: 'Antarctica jumped up and bit me on the ass.

New footage of Prince Harry's trek to the South Pole shows the Royal suffering from altitude sickness

Growth: Prince Harry insisted to the wounded servicemen and women joining him on his 124-mile South Pole trek last year that his beard was blond

Harry undertook the 10-day journey dragging an 11st sledge over the snow and ice, alongside 12 servicemen and women from the UK and teams from other nations.

But the exertion and the high altitude, as well as dehydration combined to leave him drained. During the eighth day, after a nagging headache, he tells a medic: 'It feels as though it's expanding. It's getting worse and worse.'

Harry explains later: 'If you show a weakness to Antarctica, I think it exploits it. And I think it will slowly grind you down until you have the utmost respect for it, which I now have.

Alongside other teams from the US and commonwealth, the Royal hiked 124 miles to the South Pole

'I thought I could come out here and just crack on and see it through without any issues, make sure I'm here for the guys when they need me.

'I'm frustrated and disappointed in myself, but it really does prove how physically and mentally tough these guys are,' he said of his fellow adventurers, some of whom had lost limbs or suffered other injuries during service in Afghanistan.

After checking whether he had vomited from the sickness, medics ordered Harry to rest for 36 hours, which he found frustrating.

"Being tent-bound really sucks. I don't really enjoy sitting around and doing nothing, especially when I know they're walking 17km.

The trek was originally a race, but after conditions became dangerous the competition was abandoned

Eventually, on December 13, Harry and the rest of the team reached the South Pole in record-breaking time

Foul weather conditions, with temperatures plummeting as low as minus 40C (minus 40F) eventually led to the competitive race element of the challenge being abandoned, with the teams eventually arriving at the South Pole together on skis.

Relieved Harry said of his team at the finish: 'I'm so happy for them. They've done so well - every single person, but especially these guys and girls. I'm honoured and privileged to be here with these guys. It's been very special.'

Harry's South Pole Heroes Episode 2 is screened at 8pm on Sunday by ITV.
