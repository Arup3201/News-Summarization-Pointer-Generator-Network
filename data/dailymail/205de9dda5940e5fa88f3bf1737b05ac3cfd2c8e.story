A teenage girl abused by her karate teacher killed herself after being systematically failed by social workers, a coroner ruled yesterday.

In a damning verdict, he said that Dana Baker might still be alive if she had received a proper standard of care.

Dana, 16, was found hanged in March 2011 after being removed from foster parents she called Mum and Dad.

Dana Baker, 16, pictured, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, confessed to being in a relationship with karate teacher Jaspal Riat, 52, two years before she took her own life in March 2011

The teenager had been in care since 2009, when she took an overdose after revealing that karate teacher Jaspal Riat had been sexually abusing her since she was 13.

At the time Dana, who represented Great Britain, told teachers she believed she was in a ‘soap-opera romance’ with the 52-year-old paedophile, who was jailed for eight years in September 2011.

Over the 18 months to her death, she had five social workers from three different teams, three schools and two foster placements.

But even though Worcestershire Children’s Services knew there was a risk she might kill herself, social workers did little to help her because they were too busy, the inquest in Stourport heard.

Jaspal Riat, 52, from Birmingham, West Midlands, was jailed for eight years in September 2011 after being convicted of of sexual assault and seven counts of sexual activity with a child

Coroner Geraint Williams ruled that if even the ‘simplest measures’ had been taken, Dana, from Kidderminster, could have been saved. He condemned the authority for a series of ‘serious and systematic failings’ that he considered breached Dana’s human rights.

The inquest heard that Dana confessed about her relationship with Riat in a school English lesson two years before she committed suicide. Vicki Blake, Dana’s deputy headteacher at Wolverley Secondary School said she had no response from social services or police for after reporting her concerns.

At a meeting with Dana and her parents Trevor and Patricia, Mrs Blake said, the teenager said she believed she was in a ‘soap romance’. She called police again after hearing that Dana had revealed on Facebook that she was still having a relationship with Riat, that he was going to be arrested but they would run away together.Days later, Dana was placed in a psychiatric unit after taking an overdose.

A social services strategy meeting due to be held a week later never took place but Dana went into foster care. Her parents told the inquest they believed it was a short-term arrangement. But when she moved on to her second foster family, they lost contact with her.

Dana was taken away from the second couple, whom she called Mum and Dad, and sent to live with an adult friend, Sally King.

But Mrs King was given no guidance on how to look after her.

The night before she was found hanged, Dana was taken to hospital after becoming distraught at being taken away from her foster parents. In a final text to Mrs King, she wrote: ‘I love you all. I’m so sorry.’

Mr Williams said Dana had clearly intended to kill herself but added: ‘Her death was contributed to by a failure to have in place adequate measures to protect her from a known, present and continuing risk that she would kill herself.’

In a statement, Dana’s family said afterwards: ‘We will never know whether the outcome could have been different if Dana got the support she as asking for.’

Gail Quinton, head of Worcestershire Children’s Services said: ‘We have acted swiftly on areas identified for improvement and all actions in the serious case review have been undertaken. We have increased the number of social workers ‘
