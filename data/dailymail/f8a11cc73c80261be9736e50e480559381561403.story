It could be a scene from multimillion dollar Hollywood blockbuster Apocalypse Now, with daredevil pilots flying in the face of danger and fierce explosions.

But these scorching snaps were not taken on a film set, they were captured at the Australian International Airshow, where crowds were left feeling the heat by the red hot stunts being performed in the skies above them.

In a sight reminiscent of the Vietnam War epic, when United States Air Force jets leave a trail of flames behind them as they dose the jungle with napalm, the dynamic Tinstix Of Dynamite aerobatics display team packed a real punch with its state-of-the-art pyrotechnics.

Flights, camera, action! It could be a scene from a Hollywood blockbuster, with pilots producing an explosive aerial display at the Australian International Airshow

The team comprises U.S. stunt pilots Skip Stewart and Melissa Pemberton, along with the pyrotechnic wizardry of Rich Gibson, a regular at the airshow, which began on Tuesday and runs until March 3.

The breathtaking act at Avalon Airport near Geelong in Victoria involved multiple head on passes and up to a dozen explosions, and was performed in the country for the first time yesterday.

Ms Pemberton, who flies a brightly painted edge 540 and was the youngest ever woman to be part of the United States Unlimited Aerobatics team, said: 'The show is a mix of precision aerobatics, head on sequences and tight passes, all while surrounded by smoke and balls of fire.

'The feeling when the race finishes at the end and Skip and I cross as the wall of fire goes off is pretty tough to compare to anything else on earth. If the audience is having half the fun that we are having, then they are going to go home wanting more.'

Airshow organisers also arranged for the Royal Australian Air Force to show off one of its newest planes by staging a mid-air refueling demonstration.

The multi-role transport tanker aircraft, KC30A, is modelled on the Airbus A330 airliners, used by Qantas and Virgin, and is specially equipped to carry out the air-to-air role.

The aircraft flew to 15,000 ft above East Sale, where it met two 77 Squadron F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets, which went to within a few metres of the tanker for refueling.

F/A-18 pilot, Flying Officer Brent Jones, explained how the Hornet links to a 'basket' at the end of a hose being dragged along by the tanker. He said it is the most demanding skill in non-combat flying.

He told The Weekly Review: 'It's
the other extreme of fighter flying. It’s a really slow deliberate 
process, obviously you want to be really smooth around the tanker not to
make anyone nervous and get into the basket nice and safely.

Head for heights: The refueling exercise happened 15,000ft in the air, with one flying officer explaining how it is the most demanding skill in non-combat flying

'It’s the one role we can’t train for in the simulator so the only way we get better is spending more time behind the basket.'

The airshow also includes other military aircraft, such as the United States Air Force's F-22 Raptor, and aerobatic displays, including the world's only aerobatic formation display team to feature professional wing walkers, The Breitling Wingwalkers.

Victoria's state government announced at the start of the show it will continue to support the event, which also features vintage aircraft, until 2025.

Airshow CEO Ian Honnery greeted the decision, and described the show as 'the Asia-Pacific's most prestigious aviation, aerospace and defence events, and added it is 'a prime example of how to showcase the latest in innovation, technology and spectacular flying displays'.
