A Chinese businessman tried to hide the fact he was building two extra storeys on top of his penthouse suite with a ploy many would describe as barking â€“ by covering up the structure with trees and plants.

The unnamed man already had a roof garden on his 18th floor apartment in the city of Guangzhou in Guangdong province, but he added extra vegetation while another two floors were built illegally.

The scam was unveiled when one of the residents, worried that the extra illegally built floors might damage the rest of the building, complained to local media.

Fooled by foliage: A Chinese businessman hid two illegally built extra storeys on his penthouse suite with trees and plants

Disguise: The penthouse already had a roofgarden, but it was increased in size to deceive neighbours and officials

Brazen: The scheme was a very ambitious attempt at hiding the illegal structure

The journalists in turn confirmed that the building should have only been 18 storeys and had somehow acquired an extra two storeys that were not officially registered.

The person that leaked the report, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said they had reported the matter two years ago to local Council officials but that nothing had happened, and complained that the businessman who was also not named was too successful and the well-connected.

According to the source, the businessman had purchased the penthouse which covered the entire 18th floor several years ago and people had been been surprised when he had put huge trees and thick bushes on the roof.

Tall order: The man even used plastic plants for extra camouflage

Anger: Neighbours complained about the structure to local media

Later he had added camouflage nets that were filled with plastic plant foliage.

But under the cover of the mass of greenery, the man had slowly started to build an extension, incredibly hiding it from most of those in the block of flats by saying he was doing renovations on the 18th floor.

In reality, he was extending the 18th floor to include a 19th and 20th floor.

The local council has so far not commented although building experts interviewed by local media said that the extra illegal building work could well adversely affect the entire structure and added that it would need to be carefully tested to check there was not permanent damage, and then probably removed.
