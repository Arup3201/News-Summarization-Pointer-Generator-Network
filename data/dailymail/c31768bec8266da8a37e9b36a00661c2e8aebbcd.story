Michael Birch, 30, threatened a betting shop employee with a hammer but felt so guilty he flagged down a police car less than 24 hours later to confess

A repentant robber raided a betting shop with a hammer and then flagged down a police car to confess.

Michael Birch, 30, burst into a Ladbrokes in Southampton and threatened a cashier as they removed cash from a gambling machine at the end of the day.

He covered his face with a balaclava, had his hood up, and waved the hammer menacingly in his gloved hands.

Birch demanded the terrified worker empty the safe and then fled the store with £1,637 in cash.

He warned the employee against pressing any emergency buttons, Southampton Crown Court heard.

However, he was so overcome with guilt that he flagged down a police car less than 24 hours later to tell the officers what he had done.

Prosecutor Roderick Blain said: 'He said it was because of his gambling and said where the hammer and clothing could be found.'

Birch, from Southampton, admitted one charge of robbery on August 2 and was today jailed for three years.

Ximena Jones, defending, said her client had developed a bad gambling problem after splitting up with his partner of 16 years.

After pawning all his belongings he had resorted to carrying out the robbery.

A staff member from this Ladbrokes was asked to hand over cash as they were emptying a betting machine

She said he was sorry about the effect it had on the member of staff he held up.

Judge Peter Henry said: 'This is a serious offence without question, breaking into a premises, arming yourself and threatening someone and terrifying them, forcing them to hand over the money.'

Birch could have been jailed for four years but had the sentence reduced to three because he admitted his crime and handed himself in.
