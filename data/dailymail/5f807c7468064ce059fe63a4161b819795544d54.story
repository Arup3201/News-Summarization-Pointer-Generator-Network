An investigation has revealed how cyber criminals can easily use public Wi-Fi networks to access private information on your smartphone.

Crooks rely on the fact many people are relaxed about the security of the networks they connect to. 

While the majority of these networks are run by legitimate companies, they are sometimes created by a criminal who may be sitting nearby with little more than a laptop.

An investigation by 5 News reveals how easy it is for hackers to get information using public Wi-Fi networks

Aside from using a smartphone's Wi-Fi connection, hackers can also access a phone through the wireless 'Bluetooth' function. 

When Bluetooth is switched on, it allows it to 'talk' to other enabled devices nearby. 

This means that a hacker sitting near you can use his Bluetooth-enabled laptop to connect to your device without your knowledge. This process is sometimes called 'bluejacking' or, more properly, 'bluesnarfing' 

Now, a Channel 5 experiment has shown just how simple it is for hackers to suck information out of smartphones. 

In the investigation, security expert Jason Hart used a device which forced customers in a café to switch their phones from the establishment's legitimate Wi-Fi to his own fake Wi-Fi without them knowing.

Mr Hart's device succeeding in overriding and effectively tricking phones and computers. 

This would enable a thief to hack email accounts, obtain log-in passwords, track people's movements and steal thousands of pounds in just a few hours. 

The networks set up by criminals are often given innocent-sounding names, such as 'Free Public Wi-Fi', that con smartphone users in to logging in.

Mr Hart - who is a VP at digital security firm Gemalto - told 5 News: 'The ability for a bad guy to essentially suck information out of any wireless-enabled device is extremely easy, especially in a public area.

'I think people need to be aware of the risks of using public Wi-Fi and potentially the exposure they're putting themselves to.' 

'It's very frightening,' one customer told Channel 5 after they had been tricked.

'I just assumed that hackers - for want of a better word - would have to sit there for half a day, or a day, or a few days in order to get all your information but this was literally minutes.' 

Maxim Weinstein, a security adviser at Sophos, told MailOnline: 'The problem of people being able to intercept data on unprotected networks is an ongoing challenge we face. 

'Wi-Fi data between someone's computer, smartphone and wireless access point can be visible to anyone else using that same wireless access point. 

'There are a number of things that can be done to prevent this. One is to set up your own Virtual Private Network when accessing the internet from a public network, ensuring that apps are secure and using encryption while online.'

He added: 'It is generally more secure to use 3G or 4G networks. While there have been some examples of hacks against these networks, they are much more challenging to hack. 

'It's actually quite straight forward to get information using public Wi-Fi networks, particularly for unencrypted data. 

Mike Bradshaw, a partner with Sophos, added: 'In our war biking exercise in London we found a staggering number of wireless networks with nearly a third failing to meet basic security measures. 

'With less than £40 of equipment and a laptop it is easy to advertise a hot spot and then intercept the traffic of people whom connect - perhaps even downgrading their "secure web connections" so you can spy on really sensitive data. 

'There are multiple reasons someone might do this, from the malicious cyber criminal hoping to secure financial details or personal information for further scams, or an enterprise offering wireless hoping to use your information for "enhanced offerings". 

'It is rather difficult to identify a network which is legitimate versus one provided by a scammer and so a better strategy is simply to assume all networks have prying eyes or may be trying to manipulate your network traffic to their end.'

A survey, also conducted by Channel 5, found that one in five Britons access free public Wi-Fi 'fairly or very often'.

The majority use the Wi-Fi to surf the internet, browse emails and go on social media. 

By far the best way to beat the hackers is to set up your own Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your computer at home. Then, when you are using a public Wi-Fi hotspot, you can use your smartphone to connect to your home computer, and use its secure connection to the internet to access web pages safely.

However, this is technically challenging and most of us would need help from an IT expert to do this.

Another way to stay secure is to make sure that any supposedly secure webpages you look at feature a little padlock in the address bar, as well as the preface 'https' rather than 'http'. This means that the page is secure, and not visible to others.

Third, make sure that you regularly install the suggested updates for your smartphone's browser software.
