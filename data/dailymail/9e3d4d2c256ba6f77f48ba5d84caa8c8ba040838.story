The family of the Boston bombing suspects has received more than $100,000 in welfare benefits over the last decade, according to the Boston Herald.

Details of the benefits - which included cash, food stamps and housing assistance - are contained within more than 500 documents that were handed over from Massachusetts welfare officials to a committee of state lawmakers on Monday.

The documents have not been released publicly, but a person who has reviewed them told the Herald that the 'breadth of the benefits the family was receiving was stunning.'

In need: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, left on April 20 in Cambridge, and her husband, right in 2009, began receiving welfare shortly after the birth of their daughter

Example: The suspects' parents Zubeidat, left, and Anzor, right both at a news conference on Thursday in Dagestan, Russia, also received federal and state welfare benefits when they lived in the U.S.

The Herald also spoke to 
Massachusetts Rep. David Linsky about the documents, who promised a 
thorough review of the assistance that the family received.

'I can assure members of the public 
that this committee will actively review every single piece of 
information we can find because clearly the public has a substantial 
right to know what benefits, if any, this family or individuals accused 
of some horrific crimes were receiving,' said Linsky, the committeeâ€™s 
chairman.

It has been previously reported that deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife Katherine relied on food stamps and public assistance from 2011 to 2012, soon after they became parents.

Last Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance detailed how the couple received food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012.

The couple, who married in June 2010, are believed to have become parents to their daughter, Zahara, in 2011, in the months before they began receiving the aid.

In addition to food stamps, the young
 family also benefited from TAFDC (Transitional Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children), a program for low income parents with dependent 
children.

TAFDC is paid out twice a month and can be directly deposited into a recipient's bank account.

The assistance was paid to Katherine, since a person must be a U.S. citizen, or eligible non-citizen, to receive the aid.

Food Stamps:

Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2004: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps

Aug. 2009 to Dec. 2011: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps

Sep. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev received food stamps

Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC):

Jan. 2003 to March 2003: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money

Aug. 2009 to June 2010: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money

Sept. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev collected TAFDC money

While
 the couple took the government aid, the 24-year-old Rhode Island native
 would sometimes clock as many as 80 hours a week while 
her unemployed husband stayed at home.

Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in November 2012.

Welfare officials have been forced to 
divulge details of the aid that was paid out to the family of the 
bombing suspects.

Mass. Gov. Patrick Deval told state agencies last week that they should not discuss the details of what 
government assistance Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had received, citing privacy concerns.

Welfare information is not
 available for public release unless the person in question provides their 
consent, but it is available to lawmakers.

Massachusetts State 
Rep. David Linsky called on the state's Department of Transitional Assistance to provide him with the information.

Linksy issued an ultimatum on Thursday to welfare officials, 
giving them 24 hours to provide the information.

The letter from Rep. Linsky was provided to the Boston Herald.

'My office is working to fully comply with your request,'  DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan wrote in his report to Rep. Linsky, saying they were only providing a summary 'given the great interest in this matter.'

In addition to the aid paid out to Tamerlan and his wife, both alleged bombers had benefited from welfare since their parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev collected foodstamps and TAFDC - from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2009 to 2011.

Since the
 Tsarnaevs are Chechen immigrants, some wondered why they received aid. But the state agency explained that they were considered eligible for 
the public assistance. 

'The Tsarnaev parents were eligible to 
receive benefits as legal, non-citizen residents who were granted asylum
 status and met the basic eligibility criteria for DTA, including 
household income levels, presence of dependent children and other 
factors,' the DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan said in a letter 
addressed to David Linsky, Chairman of the House Post Audit and 
Oversight Committee.

The Herald had reported that sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very
 much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad.

His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial.

Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at 
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a 
scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the 
Boston Globe.

Investigators are scrutinizing the 
brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received 
outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or 
foreign government.

Security experts have noted though 
that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the 
materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston 
Marathon attack could have cost a total of $100 each.

Tamerlan, 26,
 died early on 
April 19 after a shoot-out with police in Watertown, Mass. His 
19-year-old brother was captured late on April 19 after an extensive 
manhunt.
