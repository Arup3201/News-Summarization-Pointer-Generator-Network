Stranded eight miles from school on the day of a crucial exam, a 16-year-old farmer's son was determined not to let the the small matter of snow get in his way.

With his mother not wanting to take the risk of driving him by car, Will Richardson got into one of his father's tractors to make the journey to Barnard Castle School in County Durham.

The teenager, who passed his tractor driving test last May, even found time to pick up a stranded classmate on his way to the hour-long geography exam.

Classmates looked on in amazement as the lower-sixth form student navigated the John Deere 6630 up the school drive.

Will said: 'When I passed my test, I said I would bring it in one day and there were quite a lot of people coming for a look. The exam was not too bad - it was worth coming in on the tractor.

'If I had not sat the exam now, I would have had to wait until May - I just had to get in. I also picked up one of my friends. His mum could not get far in the car, so I collected him at the A66 Motel and brought him in as well.'

Will lives with his parents John and Christine on a 1,300-acre farm in Hutton Magna with 200 beef cattle and 150 sheep.

Will's mother said: 'It was snowing on Monday morning and the forecast later in the day was really bad.

'Normally
I drive him to school, I could have taken him but there was a chance we
might not have made it so it was not worth the risk.

'Even
if we had made it, he might not have been able to get back later in the
day. The school is a boarding school and we knew it would be open.

Unbelievable: Will Richardson's classmates at Barnard Castle School were amazed when he arrived for his exam driving a John Deere 6630 tractor

'The snow was about six to eight inches deep and it's getting up the driveway that's the main problem - the roads themselves are quite clear and we live quite a distance from the school.

'Will heard one of his friends was 
stranded who lives in Barton, so he picked him up from the roadside on 
the A66 on the way over.'

Barnard Castle is among the minority of schools in County Durham which have remained open as normal during the cold snap.

After finishing sixth form, Will hopes to study agricultural engineering at Harper Adams University, in Shropshire.

He said: 'I want to take over the farm eventually and this will give me some idea of how to fix the machines.

'For the past three months, dad has been off because he had an operation so I have been doing a lot of the work around the farm.

'It's mainly feeding the stock. With snow on the ground, they can't get grass, so they need plenty of food.'
