A silk tie patterned with gold elephants that once belonged to Princess Diana is set to fetch up to £3,000 when it goes under the hammer next week.

In the years since her death, Diana memorabilia has become big business, with one of her dresses fetching £250,000 earlier this year while just two risque greetings cards penned by the princess sold for £2,500 at auction two years ago.

Diana wore the Escada tie when she visited St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington to see her new-born baby nephew Louis, Viscount Althorp, in 1994.

Generous Diana later sent the tie 
gift-wrapped to a friend’s daughters with a handwritten note saying she 
hoped it would make her look 'very smart' at an upcoming job interview.

The tie with its original gold gift-wrapping, a length of maroon ribbon with gold stars and notelet signed 'Lots of love, from Diana' is being sold on June 18.

Auctioneer James Grinter said: 'It is a wonderful opportunity to own an original item which was actually worn by Princess Diana.

'After she visited Earl Spencer’s new-born son at St Mary’s, she sent the elephant tie to a friend’s daughters so their father could wear it at a job interview.'

The tie, which has an estimate of between £2,000 and £3,000, is being sold with an original photograph showing the Princess wearing it on her hospital visit.

She also wore a matching black jacket by the same German designer Escada with gold elephants around each cuff.

Along with Diana's Escada tie, three Valentine's Day cards from the princess are to go under the hammer

The sale also includes three Valentine cards Diana sent to the same family showing a wooden teddy bear holding two heart balloons, a foil-covered chocolate bear and a red, foil-covered chocolate heart.

They are signed by the Princess with the message 'Lots of love from Diana, William and Harry, X' and are expected to sell for £300 to £500 each.

The item are part of a sale of Royal memorabilia being held by Colchester auctioneers Reeman Dansie.

The auction comes as excitement grows about upcoming Oliver Hirschbiegel film, Diana, which stars Naomi Watts as the tragic royal and Naveen Andrews as Dr. Hasnat Khan - the love of Princess Diana's life according to scriptwriters.

New images released by filmmakers show Watts looking strikingly like Diana and include iconic moments such as Diana's famous visit to Angola's minefields.
