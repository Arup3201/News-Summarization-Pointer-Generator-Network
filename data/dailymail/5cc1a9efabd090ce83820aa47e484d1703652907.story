Planned tube strikes on Boxing Day are expected to cause chaos on the London Underground

Planned tube strikes on Boxing Day are expected to cause chaos on the London Underground.

The strike, and two further walkouts on the last two Fridays in January, is over a long-running row about bank holiday pay.

Transport for London (TfL) said there is likely to be 'significant disruption' to services after the train drivers' union Aslef that it will be stopping work in a strike that has already led to the Premier League London derby between Arsenal and West Ham United being postponed.

TfL said they condemned Aslef 'for 
completely unnecessary disruption to Londoners on Boxing Day' and said 
they were 'making every effort to minimise disruption and to support the
economic life of London.

Planned engineering works for the day, as well as seasonal closures, will add to the headache for commuters.

Extra buses will be laid on for those
travelling to the West End, as well as the Westfield shopping centres 
in Stratford, east London, and White City, west London, TfL said.

On the Bakerloo line, Marylebone and South Kenton will be closed, on the Circle and District Line Cannon Street will be closed and there will be no service between Earl's Court and Kensington (Olympia).

There will be no services between Hainault and Woodford and Fairlop, Roding Valley, Chigwell and Grange Hill stations will be closed.

There will be no service between North Acton and Ealing Broadway but
replacement buses will operate 
via West Acton and Ealing Common.

Tube bosses have said they will be doing everything they can to make sure shoppers can get in and around London during the Boxing Day train drivers' strike.

The congestion charge will also be suspended but suburban rail services and the Overground would be suspended on Boxing Day.

But there would be some services operating on Southern and South Eastern trains into London Victoria and London St Pancras International stations as well as on the Gatwick Express and Stansted Express.

Transport for London (TfL) said there is likely to be 'significant disruption' to services after the train drivers' union Aslef said it will be stopping work in a strike. It is feared it could disrupt Boxing Day shopping footfall figures

Extra buses will be laid on for those travelling to the West End, as well as the Westfield shopping centres in Stratford, east London, and White City, west London, TfL said

TfL urged shoppers to consider walking into the West End from either Victoria or St Pancras, which would take about 20 to 25 minutes.

Howard Collins, London Underground's chief operating officer, said: 'Train drivers are paid a salary that reflects some bank holiday working, but the Aslef leadership is demanding to be paid twice for the same work and has rejected our attempts to resolve the matter.

Central line: Due to Network Rail engineering work, there will be no service between North Acton and Ealing Broadway, or between Hainault and Woodford. Fairlop, Roding Valley, Chigwell and Grange Hill stations will be closed

Circle and District lines: Cannon Street will be closed

District line: No service between Earl's Court and Kensington (Olympia). Upminster Bridge will be closed

Bakerloo line: Marylebone and South Kenton will be closed

Metropolitan line:  No service between Baker Street and Aldgate before 1045 and after 1900. No Chiltern Railways service

Metropolitan, Circle and Hammersmith & City Lines: Farringdon station will be closed for building work

Northern line: No service between Edgware / East Finchley and Charing Cross / Kennington via Bank. Replacement buses will operate on some sections. No Mill Hill East service.

Piccadilly line: North Ealing will be closed

Waterloo & City Line: No services

'The scandalous actions of the Aslef leadership are an attempt to hold Londoners to ransom, and demonstrate a wholesale disregard for our customers - making life harder for shoppers, sports fans, retail workers and businesses amongst others at an important time.

They also show a disregard for the thousands of transport staff who will be working hard to help people get around the capital.

'We will be running as many services as possible, supported by London's 700 bus routes, but there will be disruption and we would urge customers to check the TfL website and local TV and radio bulletins for up-to-date travel information.'

Aslef said the Tfl management had 'failed both the union and the public'.

It said: 'For three years on the run, our members have voted by over 90 per cent to take industrial action on Boxing Day. There is clearly a major problem.

'But London Underground refuses to deal with it - or even treat it seriously.

'Last year they said they would begin talks "in the first quarter of the year".

'They did not open discussions until a few weeks ago. And at those discussions they offered precisely nothing. They have put forward no proposals. Every initiative has come from the union side – and been rejected.

'What we are asking for is not complex. We want a volunteer service on Boxing Day with those working getting more than flat time. An enhancement for this day will ensure members will be able to swap duties with someone who wishes to work.'We have also offered to join a Joint Working Party to look at other Bank Holidays and service levels required for the future.

'Management has sat on its hands and offered nothing constructive to resolve this dispute, which is why we will take action on Boxing Day. It is because of their failure.

'We don’t expect support or gratitude from the public who will be inconvenienced on 26 December. But we hope there will be understanding.'
