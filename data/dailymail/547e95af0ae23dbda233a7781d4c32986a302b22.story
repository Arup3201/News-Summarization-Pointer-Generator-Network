A trio of eighth graders from Brooklyn have rocked their way to a $1.7 million record deal with Sony. 

Thirteen-year-old guitarist Malcolm Brickhouse, 13-year-old bassist Alec Atkins and 12-year-old drummer Jarad Dawkins have signed a two-album deal with the option for four more records for their metal band, Unlocking the Truth.

They are promised $60,000 for their first album and could get an advance of $350,000 for their second, the New York Daily News reported. They are also working on a book and a documentary.

Malcolm and Jarad started the band before asking their childhood friend Alec to play bass, even though he didn't know how, their website explains.

After the two friends taught him how to play, they started performing in Times Square and Washington Square Park, backed by their parents.

After they posted videos of their gritty performances on YouTube, they started picking up followers - including Eric Clapton's drummer who helped them get gigs across the region.

In one video in Times Square last summer, Malcolm's father can be heard telling an impressed bystander: 'This is their biggest crowd... But they'll be playing a lot biggger.'

He added that they weren't looking for a singer but wanted to wait until the boys' voices broke. Their voices have since deepened and they all share singing duties and are taking vocal lessons.

Since being picked up on YouTube, they have played at the Apollo Theater, Webster Hall, during a 
Brooklyn Nets playoff game and at the Coachella music festival earlier this year.

In June, they even opened for Guns N' Roses - getting a personal thanks on Twitter from the band - and will soon open for Queens of the Stone Age.

Annette Jackson, Malcolm's mother 
and the group's co-manager, said Sony contacted them and wanted to offer a contract over the phone but flew the boys out to Los Angeles first.

They performed for Sony and papers have been filed in 
Manhattan Supreme Court because the boys are minors and need court approval to sign a contract, the Daily News explained.

They will complete two albums and have the option for four more. If they work with Sony on all six albums, the boys could earn as much as $1.7 million, the Daily News reported.

'It's so exciting. We're jumping over the moon,' Dawkins' mother, Tabatha Dawkins, said.

But she said that despite the excitement of their music career, the boys have something else to focus on first - their education.

'School work comes first,' she said. 'If their school work is not done, they don't play.'
