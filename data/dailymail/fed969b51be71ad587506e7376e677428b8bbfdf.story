 As Texas A&M's mascot, she is considered the 'highest ranking member of the Corps of Cadets'.

So, when Reveille VIII the collie was put in danger, it was only right that another cadet saved her.

The young man shielded the dog after defensive back Nick Harvey pushed SMU wide receiver Der'rick Thompson out of bounds during a game yesterday.

Footage shows the opposition player hurtling toward the collie, who was napping on a red-and-wide cushion at the side of the field. 

But as he got within inches of Reveille, the unnamed cadet stepped in and performed a perfect block, saving the dog from being trampled.

The incredible moment was filmed by TV crews during yesterday afternoon's game, which saw Texas A&M earn a 58-6 victory over SMU.

However, Reneville seemed unfazed by her near-miss, looking up briefly before continuing to sleep.

According to the university, the collie is referred to as 'Miss Rev, ma'am' by her fellow cadets.

Since she was introduced to the campus in August 2008, she has become 'a highly cherished mascot and the most revered dog' among students. 

However, the SMU game was one of the last that she will attend as she will be retiring in the spring.

The identity of the member of Company-E who saved Reveille remains unknown.
