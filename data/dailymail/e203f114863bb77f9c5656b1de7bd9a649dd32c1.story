The Crown Prosecution Service was today accused of ‘making a fool of the courts’ after the trial of four teenagers was abandoned because of an email blunder.

Toby Roberts, 18, Christopher Wicks, 19, Malik Aljerrari, 19, and Sofyan Aljerrari, 18, were due to stand trial at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court in Dorset over an alleged theft of a pair of sunglasses.

While the prosecution spent four months building its case, the alleged victim found his sunglasses and it turned out that they had simply been lost rather than stolen.

Hearing: At Bournemouth Magistrates' Court (file picture) in Dorset, furious magistrate Martin Simms blasted the Crown Prosecution Service for the blunder and said the case being brought to court was 'unacceptable'

The police updated the CPS via email but due to a ‘human error’ no-one saw the message and the prosecution continued for three more months at an estimated cost of £5,000.

The four defendants had no idea of the misunderstanding and appeared for trial as scheduled. It was only then that a CPS solicitor explained that the case should have been dropped in January.

Furious magistrate Martin Simms blasted the CPS for the blunder and said the case being brought to court was ‘unacceptable’.

Addressing the defendants, he said: ‘You are free to go as there is no case to answer - however, we will make our feelings felt strongly on the records.

‘In the interests of justice we can only apologise for the length of time you have been bouncing backwards and forwards.’

John Reynolds, representing Sofyan Aljerrari, said: ‘This was known a long time ago and nobody bothered to tell the court. In that sense the court has been made a fool of. It is utterly ridiculous.’

Chris Wicks, 40, the father of Christopher Wicks, said the ordeal had left his son ‘distressed’ and described the proceedings as ‘a waste of taxpayers’ money’.

He said: ‘The whole thing caused Chris a lot of stress. He was really worried about it. He was supposed to join the Army but couldn’t do because the trial was hanging over him.

‘The whole family were quite distressed. To then find out there was no evidence against him and that the Crown Prosecution Service had known that for months is unbelievable.

‘It’s a total waste of everyone’s time - let alone thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money.’

Mr Roberts, of Poole, Mr Wicks, of Bournemouth, and the Aljerarri brothers, of Bolton, Lancashire, were arrested on September 30 after they were allegedly seen breaking into cars in Poole.

They were found with a pair of sunglasses matching those missing from one of the cars. Attending a preliminary hearing at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court in December, they denied the charges.

The following month the alleged victim, who lives in Spain, changed his statement after finding his sunglasses.

But the blunder wasn’t revealed until the
 defendants returned for a two-day trial on April 28. A CPS spokesman 
blamed the mistake on ‘human error’.

She said: ‘On January 31, Dorset Police 
received the information from the alleged victim that he was in fact in 
possession of his glasses, which were identical to the ones found on the
 suspect and that he wished to change his statement.

'The whole thing caused Chris a lot of stress. He was really worried about it. He was supposed to join the Army but couldn’t do because the trial was hanging over him'

‘The police communicated to us this information via email and due to a human error this was not immediately picked up until the file was reviewed in preparation for the trial on April 16.

‘We immediately emailed the police of our intention to discontinue the case once we were no longer satisfied that there was still sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.

‘We then requested the police to provide us a statement from the alleged victim confirming that he had found his glasses.

‘The statement was only provided to us on April 25 and as a result we offered no evidence.

‘We fully recognise that this case should have been reviewed once we received the information from the police at the end of January, we are now looking at our process to ensure that this error does not happen in the future.’
