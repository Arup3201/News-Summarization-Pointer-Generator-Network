Jailed: Ali Adorus is currently in jail in Ethiopia after being convicted of terrorism offences

This is the Londoner who travelled on 'safari' with evil Islamic State killer Jihadi John.

Ali Adorus, 33, travelled to Tanzania in 2009 with Mohammed Emwazi when the pair were held and questioned by security services before being deported.

Adorus, who was born in Ethiopia but grew up in London, is currently in an African prison after being convicted of terrorism offences.

The married father-of-one was arrested in Ethiopia in January last year.

Authorities say he entered the country in 2011 to try to establish Islamic rule through acts of 'terrorism'.

Adorus grew up in a council house in north London and it remains unclear how he befriended Emwazi.

He is believed to have worked as a security guard after studying at college in east London.

Adorus was also known to the British intelligence services and received support from the controversial human rights group Cage, according to The Times.

Along with German national Marcel Schrodl, the three were questioned by security services in Tanzania and later by British intelligence officers in Amsterdam and Dover.

They complained about their treatment to Cage, who provoked outrage last week after describing Emwazi as ‘extremely kind’ and ‘beautiful young man’. 

At his trial in Ethiopia, prosecutors said that Adorus was 'accused of trying to unconstitutionally change the government and introduce Islamic government in Ethiopia by terrorism'.

But Cage said that he was simply visiting relatives and gave a false confession in Amharic - a language he does not speak - after being 'brutally tortured'. 

They said that the case 'confirms a worrying pattern of young Britons of East African descent being harassed by MI5 and later ending up tortured in a third country'. 

He initially faced the death penalty but was then jailed for four-and-a-half years, along with two other British nationals.

An anonymous family friend said that Adorus's relatives would not discuss his case in Ethiopia.

Neighbours on the estate where he grew up described him as a 'good lad' and said that they found it difficult to believe that he had been jailed.

One of his neighbours in London described him as a 'kind, beautiful and innocent human being'.

In August, his wife wrote on a support group: 'We will get him home soon, Inshallah!'

Following his arrest and detention in Ethiopia, Cage went on to petition the former foreign secretary William Hague and the Ethiopian ambassador over concerns that Adorus had not received a fair trial.

In a letter on the Change petition site, they said: 'I have seen information according to which he was severely tortured in Maekelawi police station.

'According to an urgent appeal made to the United Nations, Ali Adorus was brutally beaten, handcuffed behind his back for an extended period of time, beaten on his hands with heavy wires, hooded, given electric shocks and denied access to a toilet.'

In 2009, Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Emwazi and Schrodl, an Islamic convert who may have used the alias Umar and who described himself as a translator.

The trio thought to have approached Cage about their 2009 treatment in Amsterdam, after their deportation from Tanzania.

The group reported that they and Emwazi were 'repeatedly harassed' by the Dutch and British authorities.

Cage compiled a report in which it accused their interrogators of comparing Muslims and Islam to dogs and terrorism. 

The group said that Adorus had been told by security service officers that 'our details will be passed to the secret services of the whole world'.
