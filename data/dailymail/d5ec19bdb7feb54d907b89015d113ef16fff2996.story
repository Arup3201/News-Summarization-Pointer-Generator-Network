A young model is set to compete for the same world beauty crown as her mother did 30 years ago.

Victoria Tooby, 20, beat 71 other competitors to win a heat in the UK while mother Caroline, 52, looked on with pride.

The former Miss Wales turned accountant shone at the same event in 1982 when she was 21-years-old.

After her win, blonde Victoria, from Colwyn Bay, North Wales, will be heading to Japan to compete for the coveted Miss International 2014 title in November.

But this time, three decades after her mother put on the sash, she is hoping to win before heading to university to train as a barrister and prove she has both brains and beauty.

Victoria said: 'It sounds really cheesy but I'm so proud to be able to follow in the footsteps of my mum.

'She competed at the Miss International event when she was younger and to say that I'm about to do the same thing is phenomenal.

Flashback: Her mother Caroline qualified for the Miss International competition in 1982 after being named Miss Wales in Cardiff in the same year

'I never in my wildest dreams expected to win the Miss International UK event.

'I was competing against the best people in the country - I never believed I had a genuine chance of winning.

'During an interval my mum and dad told me how proud they were of my performance but I didn't think I'd done all that well. The next thing I was announced as the winner of the whole thing and I dropped to the floor.

'I started to cry because I was so shocked and overwhelmed - my stomach was doing back flips.

'But when it started to sink in that I'd won I felt absolutely incredible. I just hope I can make my parents proud in Japan and it would be amazing if I could win it after my mum came so close all those years ago.'

Getting in shape: Size 6 Victoria explained that a lot of preparation went into Miss International UK; she stepped up her work out regime and started eating healthier

Winner: Victoria won two knock-out rounds at the event at the Palace Hotel in Manchester to earn the title that means she will fly to Japan in November

Doing her proud: Caroline, pictured competing in Japan in 1982, said: 'I'd love her to win the competition that I came so close to winning - it really would be a special feeling'

Victoria won two knock-out rounds at the event at the Palace Hotel in Manchester to earn the title that means she will fly to Japan for the contest on November 12.

Despite her fondness for make-up and the pomp and glitz of a pageant, the 20-year-old is keen to show she has brains as well as beauty.

After studying English language, drama, theatre studies and history at Eirias High School, she was granted a place at Oxford Brookes University to study law.

Victoria said: 'I'm about to start a three year course in law at university because I'd love to become a barrister.

'It's completely different to the pageant side of things but it's great to keep my options open for my career.

'Competing at pageants has improved my confidence so much and I'll always enjoy the thrill of being up on stage at events.

'But I've wanted to be a barrister for some time now so I'll be getting stuck into the books before travelling out to Japan.

'I'm just getting ready for a hectic few months but it's amazing to have two completely different things in my life that I enjoy.'

Spot the difference: Speaking about Victoria's next challenge, Caroline, pictured right at the pageant in the 1980s, said: 'It's extraordinary to see her getting ready to compete at the same event as I did just over 30 years ago. It really would be a dream come true to see her bring the crown back home'

Size 6 Victoria explained: 'A lot of preparation went into Miss International UK, I stepped up my work out regime and started eating healthier.

'I practiced walking and also interview techniques and I'm having to do the same now for the Miss International competition.

'I'm definitely making sure I up my game and make the most out of the opportunity I've been given.'

Mother-of-three Caroline qualified for the Miss International competition in 1982 after being named Miss Wales in Cardiff in the same year.

She also finished as a runner up at the Miss Europe event in Turkey and the Miss Intercontinental competitions in Colombia the same year.

Caroline said it would be a dream come true if her daughter claimed the top prize she narrowly missed out on 30 years ago.

She said: 'Victoria is such a confident person and I was ecstatic when she won Miss International UK this year.

'I actually started to cry - I was that proud of her.

'It's extraordinary to see her getting ready to compete at the same event as I did just over 30 years ago. It really would be a dream come true to see her bring the crown back home.

'In some ways the events are exactly the same as they were when I did them.

'I won Miss Wales and was entered straight into Miss International but Victoria had to beat off competition from the whole of the UK before qualifying for the same event.

'I'd love her to win the competition that I came so close to winning - it really would be a special feeling.

'Whatever happens I'll be incredibly proud of her.'
