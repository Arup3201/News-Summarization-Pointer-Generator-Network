Swansea manager Gary Monk is chasing Montpellier defender Benjamin Stambouli.

The Swans want to strengthen their squad ahead of Saturday’s big kick-off and the 24-year-old is interesting the Welsh club.

Swansea have opened talks with Montpellier over a move for the versatile defender, though an agreement is yet to be reached.

Transfer: Swansea are interested in signing Montpellier's 24-year-old defender Benjamin Stambouli

Stambouli, who has 14 caps for France Under-21, is understood to be open to a move to England.

Swansea have already brought in Gylfi Sigurdsson , Jefferson Montero, Marvin Emnes, Lukasz Fabianski, Bafetimbi Gomis and Stephen Kingsley this summer.

But The Swans' defence has suffered significant losses. Goalkeeper Miche Vorm and left-back Ben Davies both moved to Tottenham while centre-back Chico left for Qatari club Lekhwiya.

Stambouli played as a defensive midfielder, centre-back and full-back for Montpellier last season and, with so many players leaving Wales, his versatility will be an undeniable asset.
