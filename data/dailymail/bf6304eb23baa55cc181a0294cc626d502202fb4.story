The 20-year-old Harvard University student suspected of emailing a bomb threat to derail final exams this week was set free today on $100,000 bond after making an initial court appearance.

Eldo Kim's attorney, Ian Gold, said his client was under a great deal of pressure and seems to regret his actions.

‘He’s a very remorseful, shattered young man,’ Gold said.

Harvard hoaxer: Eldo Kim walks to a waiting taxi Wednesday after being  released on $100,000 bond into the custody of his sister and uncle

Kim was released into the custody of his sister, who lives in Massachusetts, and an uncle from North Carolina. Attorneys aren’t saying where he will stay.

Under the conditions of his release, he cannot enter Harvard’s campus without prior approval of Harvard and the federal court, other than to retrieve his belongings with an escort.

This morning, Kim was led into court in
 handcuffs and wearing dark sweatpants with 'Harvard' written down the left leg and a gray T-shirt.

Mr Gold, a federal public defender, said Kim was dealing with the pressure of finals and the third anniversary of the death of his father, a professor at a South Korean university.

According to the lawyer, Kim became a naturalized U.S. citizen in fifth grade and renounced his South Korean citizenship.

Kim did not enter a plea during an earlier hearing Wednesday.

Kim, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has
 been charged with sending the electronic threats to multiple offices 
associated with the Ivy League university.

Kim confessed to sending the emails from an anonymous address in order to get out of taking an exam, according to court documents.

The missives falsely warned there were 'shrapnel bombs placed in science center, sever hall, emerson hall, thayer hall, 2/4. guess correctly. be quick for they will go off soon.'

The subject line of the emails read 'bombs placed around campus.'

An undated Harvard University bio page lists an Eldo Kim in the department of psychology.

He lists his graduation date as 2016 in an article he wrote in April for the Harvard Independent. He also performs with the Harvard Breakers dance troupe.

If convicted, he could face a maximum of five years in prison an a fine of $250,000.

Kim attended Kamiak High School, graduating in June 2012, Andy Muntz, a spokesman for the Mukilteo School District, said Wednesday.

While there, Kim was a National Merit Scholarship finalist and participated on the tennis and debate teams, Muntz said.

A cached version of Kim’s LinkedIn profile, which has been taken down, indicates that he did several internships in South Korea.

Authorities said Kim told them he emailed the bomb threats about a half-hour before he was scheduled to take a final in Emerson Hall. He said he was there at 9 a.m. when he heard the alarm sound and knew his plan had worked, according to an FBI affidavit.

On Saturday night, Kim sent an email over his dorm Listserv, The Harvard Crimson reported.

‘I was wondering if anyone had taken GOV 1368: The Politics of American Education (Paul Peterson) in the past,’ Kim wrote in the email. ‘I have several quick questions about the course.’

Too busy? While he's been extremely active in extracurricular since high school--he played the viola, played tennis and swam, and more recently danced in a Harvard dance troupe--Kim's confession indicates he'd spread himself a little thin and went to extreme measures to catch up

According to the complaint, Kim sent 
emails to Harvard police, two university officials and the president of 
the Harvard Crimson newspaper, saying bombs had been placed around 
campus.

An FBI affidavit
 says Harvard determined Kim had accessed TOR, a free Internet product 
that assigns a temporary anonymous Internet protocol address, using the 
university’s wireless network.

As
 a sophomore at Kamiak, Kim was a National Peace Essay Contest winner 
with other students nationwide, a program sponsored by the 
federally-funded United States Institute of Peace, whose mission is to 'increase the nation's capacity to manage international conflict without violence

His contest biography described him as a member of varsity tennis and the swim team, as well as the debate team.

‘Eldo
 is also a member of National Honor Society and tutors students in 
mathematics. He is enrolled in the Seattle Conservatory of Music and 
plays the viola,’ the biography said.

Kim
 also was described as a voluntary research assistant for a professor at
 Korea University, and has assisted in the development of a model for 
public acceptance of the management of radioactive waste.

Blocked off: Police block off the entrance to the Science Center, one of the targeted buildings

‘During
 the summer of 2008, he traveled with fellow high school students to 
Peru and rebuilt rural communities,’ the biography said. ‘He enjoys 
writing and competing in sports. Eldo plans to major in Political 
Science and is excited for what the future holds in the coming years.’

Two
 hours after threats were sent to officials and the Harvard Crimson 
newspaper, authorities had already decided they were likely a hoax.

Investigators from several agencies 
searched the buildings for hours before determining there were no 
explosives. One of the buildings was a freshman dormitory; classes are 
held in the other three.

In a statement to the Harvard community, Harvard Executive
Vice President Katie Lapp said that the buildings were evacuated ‘out of an
abundance of caution’ and that activities at the Ivy League school in Cambridge
were returning to normal.

‘I am relieved to report that no suspicious devices were
found,’ Lapp said in her statement.

Secured: After a sweep of the buildings, including the Science Center, no explosives were found

Search: A police officer secures an area at Harvard on Monday after the threat was emailed to authorities

The mood on campus 
was calm as students streamed out of Harvard Yard on a frigid morning 
with temperatures in the 20s. The gates around the yard were closed and 
people were allowed to leave but not enter unless they had school IDs.

A classroom building was also briefly 
evacuated Monday at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, which has 
16,000 undergraduates and graduate students who are also taking final 
exams this week.

University police got a call from someone who said they
 had seen a person with a gun in the building, which was closed while 
university, Boston and state police searched it. They determined there 
was no one with a gun and the call is being investigated, said school 
spokesman DeWayne Lehman.
