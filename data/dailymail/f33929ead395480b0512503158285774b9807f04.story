North America’s woolly mammoth, giant ground sloths and sabre-tooth tigers were wiped out by a devastating comet 12,900 years ago.

This is according to a controversial study by Californian Professor James Kennet which suggests that an ancient cosmic impact triggered a vicious cold snap.

Now a research team from University of California, Santa Barbara, claims to have further evidence to back up Professor Kennett's 2007 ‘Younger Dryas impact theory’.

Scientists from University of California, Santa Barbara, found nanodiamonds around rock sediment that formed during the Big Freeze 12.900 years ago. In these images nanodiamond textures in the sediment are shown using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope

The Younger Dryas, or the ‘Big Freeze’, saw a rapid return to glacial conditions in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere between 12,900–11,500 years ago.

Researchers claim that debris thrown into the atmosphere from an impact may have tipped the Earth into global cooling, wiping out megafauna along with native cultures such as the Clovis people.

The theory is partly based on the presence of nanodiamonds along Bull Creek in the Oklahoma Panhandle, which is one type of material that could result from an extra-terrestrial collision.

The research team re-examined the distribution of nanodiamonds in Bull Creek’s geological record to see if they could reproduce the original study’s evidence.

‘We were able to replicate some of their results and we did find nanodiamonds right at the Younger Dryas Boundary,’ said Alexander Simms, an associate professor the University of California.  

Researchers analysed 49 sediment samples representing different time periods and environmental changes.

They identified high levels of nanodiamonds immediately below and just above Younger Dryas deposits and in late-Holocene near-surface deposits.

The late Holocene began at the end of the Pleistocene 11,700 years ago and continues to the present.

The researchers believe that the presence of nanodiamonds was not caused by environmental changes, soil formation, cultural activities, or the amount of time in which the landscape was stable.

They believe whatever process produced the elevated concentrations of nanodiamonds at the onset of the Younger Dryas sediments may have also been active in recent millennia in Bull Creek.

A ‘recent’ meteorite impact did occur near Bull Creek but scientists aren’t sure exactly when.

However, they claim this provide compelling evidence that the nanodiamonds were the result of a comet collision.

The Younger Dryas comet theory has been criticised for a number of reasons, including suggestions that the human population didn't decline at the time,

Some scientists believe that the Big Freeze was a result of the North American ice sheet breaking apart and flooding the Atlantic Ocean with freshwater.  

This, they claim, prevented currents taking warmer water north, which caused a colder climate.

A separate study last year found further evidence that a cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘Clovis’ people of North America.

A layer of platinum from an ice core taken in Greenland was dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition, known as the 'Big Freeze' that led to their demise.

According to researchers at Harvard University, this provides evidence that a comet tipped the world into its colder phase, making dozens of species extinct.

Researcher Michail Petaev and Harvard colleagues, writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found a 100-fold increase in platinum concentration in ice that is around 12,890 years old.
