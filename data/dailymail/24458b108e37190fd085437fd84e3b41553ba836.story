A pensioner was dragged to her death when her shopping bag became trapped in a taxi door as it drove off, an inquest heard.

Maureen Harrison, 72, was pulled 10 feet along the road outside her home in Bristol by the vehicle after she accidentally shut the holdall in the door.

Unsuspecting taxi driver Stephen Edwards pulled Mrs Harrison to the ground and towed her along the road as the widow clung to the bag.

She suffered horrific injuries, including a fractured skull, pelvis, collarbone, spine and ribs.

Scene of the tragedy: Victoria Terrace, Bristol, near to Mrs Harrison's home

Mrs Harrison died in hospital five days later from a bleed in her brain - the day after her 72nd birthday.

Mr Edwards, 63, broke down in tears as he told the inquest at Flax Bourton, North Somerset, he had only stopped his taxi in Victoria Terrace after he heard a horrified passer-by shouting.

He said that just moments earlier he had dropped 'frail and wobbly' Mrs Harrison off outside her house and she had waved him off.

'She got out of the car, she had a shopping bag,' he said

'She slammed the door and said "Drive on driver, go on, go on, cheerio".

'I drove off and I was dragging her down the road and I didn’t even know because she was below the window.

'Someone said "Stop, stop, stop!" and I did. She was lying in the road.'

The driver said Mrs Harrison was an 'independent' lady who would not have accepted help getting out of his silver Skoda.

'I drove off and I was dragging her down the road and I didn’t even know because she was below the window.

'Someone said "Stop, stop, stop!" and I did. She was lying in the road.'

The inquest heard the incident happened at 12.40pm on September 13 last year.

Mrs Harrison was dropped off after she had been shopping in the city's upmarket suburb of Clifton.

Mr Edwards told the court he had only realised the elderly lady was being pulled behind him when onlooker Jim Kelliher, 43, raised the alarm.

Mr Kelliher said: 'She got out of the car and I saw her close the door.

'She had her handbag, it was stuck in the door. As the taxi drove off I saw her going down sideways.

'I got out my car and stood over Mrs Harrison because she was on the floor. By that time she was unconscious.'

Mrs Harrison was taken to the Bristol Royal Infirmary for treatment for fractures, head injuries and bruises.

She initially seemed to be stable but her condition rapidly deteriorated and she suffered further bleeding in her brain and died at 6.35am on September 18.

Mrs Harrison was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary but died five days later

Dr Sanchit Mehendale , a consultant in trauma and orthopaedics at Bristol Royal Infirmary, told the inquest there was nothing that could have been done to prevent her rapid deterioration.

He said: 'She came in with significant injuries to the brain and rib fractures.

'All her injuries were stable.

'I think the cause for sudden deterioration probably was some bleeding into the brain, bringing her death.

'I cannot think of any care or treatment that could have avoided her death.'

Dr Christopher Collins, who performed a post mortem examination on her body, said the bleed could not have been anticipated.

He added: 'She had fractures to the ribs and the pelvis. In the cranial cavity there was a long skull fracture.

'My feeling was that there was a sudden deterioration associated with a re-bleed.'

Police sergeant Leona Naish, of Avon and Somerset police, told the inquest the driver acted correctly.

She said: 'When watching her, his focus would have been on her and not the bag that she was holding.

'In hospital, Mrs Harrison told an officer that her bag had become trapped in the car door and she didn’t know why she didn’t let go.'

Mrs Harrison's son Daniel described his mother as being 'quite lucid in A&E'.

He said: 'She said it was such a silly thing.

'She did have such a ridiculously high level of pain tolerance.

'She said she was two to four out of ten on the pain scale, when it was clear to see that she was in a very bad way.'

Coroner Maria Voisin ruled Mrs Harrison’s cause of death to be accidental death, caused by intercranial haematoma as a result of a skull fracture and multiple injuries.

She said: 'It is my opinion that based on the evidence, injuries sustained in the road accident were causative to her death.'

Speaking after the verdict, Mrs Harrison’s heartbroken sons paid tribute to their mother.

Matthew said: 'She was a very independent woman.

'It was just a tragedy she died in that way, without no one to blame for it.

'I feel the initial written statement
from the hospital raised some questions that I wanted to have answered 
and I feel satisfied that they have been answered now.'

Daniel said: 'We miss her an awful lot.'
