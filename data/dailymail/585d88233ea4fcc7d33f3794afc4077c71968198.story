Preachers of hate will be banned from public speaking or spreading their poison on social media, under sweeping new powers unveiled today.

Home Secretary Theresa May says the fanatics are creating an ‘environment’ where acts of violence become acceptable and they must be silenced.

The Extremist Disruption Orders – which have been dubbed Asbos for hate clerics – will target the likes of Anjem Choudary, who for years has spread bile at public meetings or on the internet.

Home Secretary Theresa May, who said fanatics are creating an ‘environment’ where acts of violence become acceptable, has unveiled the Extremist Disruption Orders – which have been dubbed Asbos for hate clerics

The definition will also include anybody who seeks to ‘overthrow democracy’. In the past, the rules could have applied to spokesmen for Sinn Fein, such as Gerry Adams.

The restrictions placed on the hate preachers will be backed by criminal punishments and a possible jail term. They could include a ban on speaking at public events.

Anything they want to put on social media would have to be cleared by the authorities in advance, and the fanatics could also be banned from attending specific events and told who they can associate with, in powers that are similar to the now defunct control orders.

Also, they could be stopped from taking positions of responsibility, such as in schools, where they could spread their message.

In a separate move, new banning orders will target extremist groups in order to make it easier to force them to disband.

Mrs May said hate preachers had been operating on the ‘very margins’ of the criminal law, which was designed to tackle incitement to acts of terrorism.

She now wants to target the extreme views whipped up by the fanatics which can lead to violence.

In an exclusive interview, she told the Mail: ‘It creates the environment in which that sort of thinking appears to be acceptable.

‘Of course we want to maintain free speech but we do not want to see incitement.’

Mrs May also warned of the dangers of sharia courts operating in Britain which do not work to ‘British values’. 

The Home Secretary said she been given examples of sharia courts passing verdicts on women trying to flee violent or abusive relationships which did not amount to ‘fair treatment’.

She wants Muslim women to be reassured that they have recourse to the British legal system and do not have to accept unjust verdicts.

A crackdown on ‘absurd’ human rights rulings which threaten to hamper British troops carrying out vital missions was last night signalled by the Defence Secretary.

Michael Fallon said he was ‘appalled’ that legal challenges over incidents that happened in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the taxpayer £85million – money which could have been spent on new kit.

The Government wants to restrict judgments which decree that the European Convention on Human Rights applies on the battlefield.

Mr Fallon said the prospect of health and safety-style laws could seriously impact on Britain’s military capability. A series of court rulings in both Britain and Europe have extended the reach of human rights laws over military actions and, critics say, open the door of claims against the Government.

Mr Fallon said: ‘I’m appalled. It’s not just being used, it’s being abused. We already have military law and we already have international humanitarian law, we certainly do not need European law in this area hamstringing the efforts of our armed forces.’

He added: ‘We’ll end up with every platoon taking a legal adviser out on patrol and that is quite simply unacceptable.’

Stepping into what is a sensitive area, Mrs May said: ‘There are good sharia courts but we need to look that all sharia courts are operating within British values.’

The so-called EDOs targeting hate clerics would be issued by the courts as a civil power, following an application by the police. There will be a right of appeal to the High Court.

The authorities would have to show, on the ‘balance of probabilities’, that the individual ‘is undertaking, has undertaken, or proposes to undertake activities that spread, incite, promote or justify hatred against a person or group of persons on the grounds of that person’s or group of persons’ disability, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and/or transgender identity’.

The move is likely to draw fierce criticism from civil liberties groups and some MPs, given that the people targeted will not have been convicted of any crime.

The Lib Dems are also certain to object to such a dramatic step, but Mrs May insists the powers are necessary. They will be included in the Tory manifesto with the intention of being passed shortly after the election.

The powers will sit side-by-side with the banning orders, which also address the problem of groups which operate on the fringes of criminal law.

In her speech to the Tory conference in Birmingham today, Mrs May will also announce that the Home Office is taking control across Government of tackling Islamic extremism. Currently, responsibility is shared with the Communities Department run by Eric Pickles.

Schools and other public bodies will be told they have an obligation to promote British values to try to prevent a repeat of the Birmingham schools ‘trojan horse’ plot. 

Politicians have for years warned of the dangers posed by hate preachers such as Choudary and his former mentor Omar Bakri, but have not produced a solution for those who know the boundaries of the criminal law. Officials believe that, in an era of social media, it is vital to find a solution.

Last week Choudary was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned terrorist group but was then released within 48 hours.

He claimed his arrest had been ‘politically motivated’ ahead of the vote for the UK to join military action against the Islamic State in Syria.
