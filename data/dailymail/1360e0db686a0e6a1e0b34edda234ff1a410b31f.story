China plans to finally end the controversial practice of systematically harvesting the organs of executed prisoners for use in transplant operations, it has been reported.

The Government has over the last year flagged plans to end the practice, which has drawn criticism from rights groups, who have accused authorities of taking many organs without consent from prisoners or their families, a claim Beijing has denied.

The official China Daily said that human organ transplants
will rely on voluntary public donations and on donations from living relatives from January 1.

'Harvesting organs from executed prisoners for transplants
is controversial, despite written consent being required from
donors and their relatives,' Huang Jiefu, head of the China
Organ Donation Committee, was quoted as saying.

'The Chinese government has always been resolute in making
efforts to end such a practice,' added Huang, a former vice
health minister. 

'Donations by the public should be the only
source of organs for transplants.'

Supply of human organs falls far short of demand in China,
due in part to a traditional belief that bodies should be buried
or cremated intact.

An estimated 300,000 patients are
wait-listed every year for organ transplants, and only about one
in 30 ultimately receives a transplant.

That shortage has fuelled the illegal trade in organs, and
in 2007 the government banned transplants from living donors,
except for spouses, blood relatives and step- or adopted family
members.

'The most severely ill get donations under the system,
regardless of their social status and wealth,' Huang said.
'Judicial departments are not entitled to decide where the organ
donations go.'

China does not publish the numbers of people it executes,
though the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, a grouping
of more than 150 non-government bodies, bar associations and
other groups, estimates it was about 3,000 last year.
