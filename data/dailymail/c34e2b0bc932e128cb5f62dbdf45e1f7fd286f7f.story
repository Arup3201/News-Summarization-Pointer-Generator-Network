Dog-loving Minister Greg Barker has acknowledged that putting his pet dachshund’s pillow-like ‘warming pad’ in the microwave at his Whitehall office was never going to be the smartest move.

Mr Barker’s colleagues at the Department of Energy use the same microwave to heat their tea and coffee – and one of them made an official complaint about his ‘unhygienic’ behaviour.

Although he has apologised, the Energy and Climate Change Minister is adamant he has no plans to stop taking his pet to work from time to time.

Conservative Mr Barker, a close friend of David Cameron, started taking 20-week-old Otto to his office because he thought he was too young to leave at home.

‘I bought the heat pad to go under his mat,’ he said. ‘It helps Otto nod off to sleep.

'Unfortunately, I forgot to heat it up at home so I popped it in the microwave when I got to the office, which I shouldn’t have done.

'There was a complaint and I have said sorry.’

Mr Barker says his dog is enormously helpful in getting meetings with foreign dignitaries off to a smooth start.

‘Otto is a tremendous ice-breaker,’ he said. ‘People melt when they see him. Some officials come to my office just to see Otto and take him for walks.

'The face of the lovely lady on our reception desk lights up when I arrive with Otto.’

One of Otto’s fans is Colombian environment minister Frank Pearl, who visited Britain recently.

Mr Barker recalled: ‘At the end  of our meeting, Mr Pearl said, “Mr Barker, can I ask a special favour? I would love to have my picture taken with your dog.” Otto was fast asleep but we took a photo and Frank sent it to his daughter in South America.

Eccentric: Mr Barker said he would continue to take the dog into work with him from time to time

‘Otto is great for morale and people love to have a cuddle with him. He lightens the atmosphere in a stressful world, though I accept that you can only take a dog to work when it is appropriate.

'But he is very small and easy to look after.’

Otto does seem to be on his best behaviour when he’s at the office, sitting next to Mr Barker’s desk for most of the day.

The Minister says the animal is house-trained, though he takes a pooper-scooper to work just in case.

‘We have only had a minor accident so far,’ he added.

Mr Barker has always been a dog-lover. His family had two labradors and an Irish setter when he was growing up.

His two children helped him choose Otto, whom he bought for £600 from a family in his East Sussex constituency.

‘Otto was the runt of the litter, but very lovable. Being a sucker for the underdog I was drawn to him,’ he joked. ‘He is happiest at my home in Sussex, but like me, he has a sense of adventure and enjoys a trip to the capital once in a while.’

Mr Barker decided to buy a dachshund after a conversation with Italian-born socialite Carla Powell, wife of Margaret Thatcher’s former adviser Charles Powell. ‘I got talking to her on an official trip to Rome. She is crazy about dachshunds.’

Mr Barker has tried to teach Otto to ‘sit’ and ‘fetch’ – without much success. ‘He will never be as clever as Pudsey on Britain’s Got Talent,’ he admitted.
