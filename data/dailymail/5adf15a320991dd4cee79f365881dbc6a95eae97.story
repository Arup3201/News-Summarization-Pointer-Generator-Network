While 3D printers are still too expensive for most of us, a Kickstarter project is hoping to fund a cheaper alternative - a pen capable of drawing 3D structures.

Called 3Doodler, the $50 (£32) pen writes using a plastic wire that hardens almost instantly on being cooled by a fan built in to the pen's tip.

It is hoped it will go on sale later this year, and the firm has already given prototypes to artists to create everything from 3D animals to reconstructions of the Eiffel tower.

Better than your average doodles: The 3D printing pen can be used to create 3D models by as the plastic 'ink' hardens almost instantly

Then pen, with the plastic 'ink' wire protruding from the back, can even draw in mid air

'Everyone knows how to use a pen, so we designed a 3D printing pen' the firm said.

'If you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.

'As you draw, plastic comes out of the pen, is cooled by an integrated fan, and solidifies right in front of you.

'You can draw on any surface and lift it up into the air to create your own 3D objects.'

The device has been created by a 
company called WobbleWorks, which is currently seeking $30,000 (£19,300)
 funding through Kickstarter.

The creators say it can also be used to repair items through using it as a plastic welding tool.

It
 has also given artists prototypes of the pen, many of whom are using it
 to create 3D doodles they then sell online via etsy.com

The pen can also be used to write on paper to create structures that can then be put together to create a 3D sculpture, such as a model of the Eiffel tower

The 3D printing pen can be used to create sculptures already being sold online

WobbleWorks is a toy company founded by Maxwell Bogue and Peter Dilworth, who both formerly worked at robotic toy company WowWee's R&D department.

Their other products include movable animals ears.
