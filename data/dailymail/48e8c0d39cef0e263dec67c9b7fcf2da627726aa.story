A boy with a rare medical condition that renders him unable to smile is being adopted by the kind-hearted nurse who cared for him in hospital.

Three-year-old Joshua Burdell suffers from Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy - a life-limiting disease which  has left him severely disabled and unable to make facial expressions.

Doctors said he would not live past a year old, and though he has proved them wrong, there is no cure for the condition, meaning his muscles will slowly degenerate and his condition will deteriorate.

Joshua inherited the disease from his mother, whose disabilities meant she couldn't look after her son.

Attempts to find foster parents had failed, and social workers had almost reached the point of despair, wondering how they were going to take care of him.

But just as it looked as though all hope was lost, the nurse who cared for him in hospital came forward, making the brave decision to adopt him and take him home. 

Joshua Burdall, three, spent the first five months of his life in hospital as his mother's disabilities meant she couldn't care for him. He is being adopted by Sarah Ruane, 51, the paediatric nurse who cared for him

Joshua has Congenital Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy - a life limiting disease causes muscle wastage and degeneration - and is severely disabled

Sarah Ruane, 51, said she couldn't bear seeing him without a home. 

Since she became Joshua's guardian, the mother-of-six has battled endlessly trying to find a cure for his condition.

After spending all of her spare time carrying out research, her hard work has won him a place on the world's first clinical trial in America, where scientists may have found a drug that could potentially cure his condition.

Mrs Ruane, who is in the process of adopting Joshua, said: 'He was my patient and was born on the maternity wing at Hull Royal Infirmary (HRI).

'When he came off the wing he went to the medical ward at 10 weeks old. He never went anywhere and his address was the hospital.

'After about six days I knew I wanted to take care of him. They were struggling to get foster carers for him and I couldn't watch it anymore.

'I went into his cubicle and looked at him. The social worker said "I don't know what we're going to do".

'I said "I do, I'll take him".

'She started crying and told her manager straight away.'

Joshua's condition means he is unable to smile or make other facial conditions. He also has severe learning difficulties. However he has defied original predictions that he would only live for a year 

Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy is the early childhood form of myotonic dystrophy - and the symptoms are evident from birth.

The rare condition, which can cause breathing difficulties for the baby shortly after delivery, can be seen if the baby appears to be 'floppy', has poor head control and lack of facial expression. 

Babies with the condition may also suffer from speech difficulties, and physical and intellectual milestones in the baby's development may be delayed. 

The disease is a genetic condition that progressively weakens and wastes the muscles.  

The impact of the degeneration varies significantly; some people may only find it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks while others will have a seriously shortened life expectancy because of the condition.

Mrs Ruane, who has been a paediatric nurse for 32 years, decided to find Joshua all the medical help possible and, with husband Alan, 43, a civil engineer, began caring for him.

Before Mrs Ruane agreed to adopt Joshua, repeated attempts to find foster carers had failed. Now she says her whole family has fallen in love with him

Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy is the early childhood form of myotonic dystrophy,and the symptoms are evident from birth.

The rare condition, which can cause breathing difficulties for the baby shortly after delivery, can be seen if the baby appears to be 'floppy', have poor head control and lack of facial expression. 

Babies with the condition may also suffer from speech difficulties, and physical and intellectual milestones in the baby's development may be delayed. 

The disease is a genetic condition that progressively weakens and wastes the muscles. 

Roughly 70,000 people in Britain carry the genes responsible for triggering muscular dystrophy.

However, many are unaware they are ‘carriers’ of the disease where a gene spontaneously changes.

The affected muscle fibres degenerate and are slowly replaced with fatty tissue.

The impact of the degeneration varies significantly; some people may only find it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks while others will have a seriously shortened life expectancy because of the condition.

Sadly, congenital myotonic dystrophy can be fatal, especially in the early weeks of life. 

There is no cure or treatment.

She said: 'Joshua had a feeding tube and club feet and they needed somebody with medical knowledge to take care of him.

'It was the right place at the right time. It was a split second decision.

'I came home and explained to my three grown-up children there was a little boy at work who the social workers were struggling to find a home for.

They said "why don't you bring him here?" and I said "It's funny you should say that".

'Two weeks later he was moved in. I never thought of doing this. Until that day I was working full time.

'Medical specialists were shocked that I brought him home - and I will always be known as that nurse who brought the baby home. 

'It's been difficult - and at times it's been heart-breaking.

'But we have all fallen in love with him. It's a nasty, progressive, awful condition. It is one of the worst conditions that I have come across.'

Mrs Ruane, who now works as a children's community nurse after leaving Hull Royal Infirmary in November 2014, worked 24 hours a day researching and asking doctors for help in trying to find a cure for Joshua.

Finally, she discovered researchers at Utah University were looking for 65 children from around the world to take part in the very first clinical programme to develop a new drug for children with CMD.

After endless emails, she got an reply back saying they would be happy for Joshua to take part.

He is the only child in the UK to take part in this programme, and the family hope it will one day lead to a cure. 

Mrs Ruane has carried out endless research, and eventually enrolled Joshua on to a clinical trial in America. A drugs company is testing an injection she hopes will cure Joshua's condition

Mrs Ruane said: 'We are consumed with helping him. It's funny how dependent on Josh I am now.

'He is a very happy little boy. He loves Peppa Pig and he is a total joy. 

'But he is weak and he can't walk very far. One of the most difficult things for him is that it affects his facial expression.

'For him that's difficult because people think there is nobody home.

'People tend to talk over him and it's just because he can't make an expression. We have also got to be careful when he eats.'

Doctors did not think Joshua would live past a year, but on his third birthday he got up and walked.

Mrs Ruane said: 'It was a miracle in itself. When this came up in America I knew I needed to find out how to save him.

'I found out they were asking for children with the condition to attend the trials in Utah and I started emailing to make sure Josh was accepted.

'It's very costly and we have done it all through fundraising.'

Mrs Ruane has raised £2,000 in fundraising money to take Joshua to America for the clinical trials. Over the next two years experts will monitor how his muscles are faili

Joshua's situation has already sparked donations towards the American trips, and so far Mrs Ruane has raised £2,000.

She said: 'The donations have given us a chance to try and save his life. The money will get him back to America.

'Everything is a battle with Josh. As harsh as it sounds, in terms of the Government, he is not going to give anything back to society.'

Mrs Ruane took Joshua for his first trip to America for the clinical trial on November 9th last year.

She said: 'Joshua had a body scan, ECG of his heart, stamina test and blood and intellectual tests.

We will go out again in October for the same tests and again the year after.

'The American drugs company is waiting for the data in the hope that they can find a drug.

'They have got the adult form of the drug and have started clinical trials for the child form.

'The drug will be in injection form - and the hope is it will stop the disease.

'When we are born, we have protein that is sent to muscles all over the body. 

'Josh has a toxin that stops that protein spreading and it stays like a dough ball.

'The drug will split the protein and send it to the parts of the body that needs it.'

Mrs Ruane and husband , said Joshua will visit Utah a further two times over the next two years where experts will monitor how his muscles are failing.

She added: 'He does have some words but his mouth muscles are very weak and his tongue muscles are too. 

'The way he is going he is improving but he will start to deteriorate.

'When we came back from America I felt like we had hope where there was previously none.'
