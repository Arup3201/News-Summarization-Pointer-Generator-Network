Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money will be spent on a new political class of government officials under plans by Cabinet ministers.

The Coalition says the employment of dozens of politically appointed civil servants – chosen by ministers and not other civil servants – is vital to ‘put a rocket’ under Whitehall and make sure they implement manifesto reforms.

But critics say the plans will see the upper echelons of the civil service being stuffed with cronies and ‘mates’ on salaries of up to £84,000 each.

Reality: The move to give ministers bigger personal teams of advisers is designed to counter the control of the civil service, described in sitcom Yes Minister as the 'opposition in residence'

Nick Clegg was forced to defend the plans in the Commons yesterday after being accused by a Tory backbencher of bringing in an unpopular style of administration from the United States.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude argues elected politicians need more support to deliver on their promises

In Britain, civil servants are traditionally appointed by other civil servants, seen as a more independent system than the politicised American system.

Ministers can currently hire a small number of political appointees known as special advisers or ‘spads’. Over the last year, the amount spent on these has jumped by 16 per cent, despite David Cameron’s pre-election pledge to ‘bring down the cost of politics’. The £7.2million total cost is now more than it was under Labour.

But the Coalition announced in July that it wanted to allow ministers to extend their private offices with the employment of more staff taken on by them and not other civil servants.

This will mean millions more will be spent on politically-appointed staff. And, unlike spads, these officials will be able to instruct other civil servants.

There will be no limit on the number of people in an extended office, but insiders played down the idea of ministers hiring ten or more aides. They will have to find the money from within existing budgets. Ministers have become increasingly frustrated with obstruction from Whitehall mandarins, which they say has led to an unacceptably slow pace of reform.

They say the problem is civil servants report to the most senior official in their department – the permanent secretary – and therefore have loyalty to him and not the minister. The Tories hope the ‘extended ministerial offices’ will force Whitehall to raise its game.

The appointees will be on civil service contracts, and will be able to command salaries of up to £84,000 without approval from Civil Service Commissioners.

But the idea was attacked in the Commons yesterday by MPs on both sides. In a reference to an American TV series, Tory MP Philip Hollobone said the plans would turn the Government in to a West Wing-style administration.

He said it will be ‘completely unpopular as far as the country  is concerned’.

Backing: David Cameron promises to cut the number of special advisers, but since being in government has admitted ministers need bigger teams, not smaller

Labour’s Luciana Berger said the plans would allow ministers to employ their friends. But Mr Clegg defended the policy, saying: ‘This is not a plan to import an endless series of political advisers.

‘This is actually recognising something that has been recommended to Government by a number of independent think-tanks and others – to allow ministers independent access to external policy expertise which is just sometimes lacking in Whitehall in offices that ministers find themselves in.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are expected to be the first to expand their coterie of advisers. Cabinet office minister Francis Maude, who drew up the plans, is also expected to hire a larger team.

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA which represents senior civil servants, said: ‘The danger is ministerial offices, staffed by personal appointees will ultimately be loyal to their minister, not the taxpayer.’
