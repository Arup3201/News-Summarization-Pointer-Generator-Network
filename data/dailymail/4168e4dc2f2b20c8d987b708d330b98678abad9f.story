Tom Daley looked a little starstruck by his companion, a peroxide blonde pop singer known as Lemon

They look like a young couple intent on some fun. And Olympic diver Tom Daley and his companion didn’t seem to mind who knew it.

The 18-year-old, whose exploits in the pool have earned him millions of female fans, seemed rather starstruck himself as his friend, a peroxide blonde pop singer known as Lemon, struck a pose in cropped T-shirt, denim shorts and boots.

Whether he was trying to teach her to dive or she was showing off some dance moves was not entirely clear.

They spent the day skimming stones on Plymouth Hoe before buying ice creams and sitting in a park.

At one point, Lemon laughed as she planted her vanilla cone on Daley’s nose.

It is thought Daley met 19-year-old Lemon, whose full name is not known, on the set of his ITV show Splash! earlier this year. Yesterday his spokesman said the pair are not dating.

Dressed in knee-high leather boots, tiny denim shorts, cropped T-shirt and studded leather jacket, Lemon certainly stood out from the crowd.

Daley opted for a far more conventional ensemble of jeans, T-shirt and trainers.

But their contrasting dress-styles did not stop them having a good time.

As they clambered over rocks to escape the rising tide, Lemon clung onto Daley’s arm for support.

Later in the day, the pair drove off together in his car.

Lemon’s agent refused to comment on whether she is in a relationship.

On Lemon’s website, she said she was a ‘Singer/Songwriter and dancer.’ She added: ‘I put on a show. Get ready for the LEMON invasion.’

Describing her music as ‘urban commercial pop’ she said her home town was: ‘Wherever you want me to be’.

Online videos of her live performances show her dressed in suspenders and a tank top on stage.
