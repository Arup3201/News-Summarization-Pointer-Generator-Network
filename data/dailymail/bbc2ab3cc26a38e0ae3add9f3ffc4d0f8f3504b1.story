A Las Vegas magician is going out of his way to help one very deserving man in need.

Rob Anderson filmed a video earlier this month where he approached homeless veteran Alan McCracken, shockingly tearing up the man's sign asking for help, but then somehow producing wads of cash for the man, a U.S. Army veteran who served for six years before an honorable discharge.

And now, he wants to do more.

Good man in need: Anderson hopes to raise $15,000 to get McCracken a hotel room for three months so he can work on finding a job

Anderson, after seeing how positive McCracken was, has started a campaign to raise $15,000 so he can get the vet off the streets and into a hotel for three months. 

The money will also cover new clothes, living expenses, and setting up a bank account for McCracken.

'Alan is just as kind in person as he appears in the video,' Anderson says on his GoFundMe page.

'He can often be seen in downtown Las Vegas with a large sign that says SMILE, just trying to bring a smile to strangers' faces, even if they don't give him any money.

If there's anyone who would be deserving of assistance to get back on their feet, it is Alan McCracken.'

Already, Anderson has almost reached his goal, and there is more good news as McCracken has found a place to stay in the interim.

'Alan has been able to get assistance in temporarily getting off the streets through the VA here in Las Vegas,' Anderson announced earlier today. 

'He is currently sleeping on a bunk bed in a room with 3 other veterans, and has his meals and other basic necessities provided by the VA. 

When I spoke with him, he had his usual positive attitude about his situation, and is optimistic about his search for a job now that he has temporary housing provided for him.'

McCracken still has no idea about the fundraiser, and Anderson plans to surprise him with the news when he reaches his goal.

All money raised will go to McCracken.
