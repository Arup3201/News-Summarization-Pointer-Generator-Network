Scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in cold and icy regions.

Melting snow has recently revealed a remarkably intact woolly jumper likely worn by a fashion-conscious reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago.

The find, which sheds more light on the life of people living in the Iron Age, was found two years ago in Norway, but has recently been examined by scientists.

Scientists using radiocarbon dating believe the woolly tunic (pictured) was made between 230 and 390 AD. Scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in icy regions and this tunic, worn by a reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago, was found in melting snow

Marianne Vedeler, from the University of Oslo and Lise Bender Jørgensen, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, told Discovery News: 'Due to global warming, rapid melting of 
snow patches and glaciers is taking place in the mountains of Norway as 
in other parts of the world, and hundreds of archaeological finds emerge
 from the ice each year.'

Other scientists have also said more hidden artefacts are being exposed in cold regions as temperatures rise, and while this is proving exciting, there is a risk that rare items could rot or disintegrate when exposed to air if they are not discovered very quickly.

The tunic, which was found in melting snow, has a trendy boat neck and is crafted from wool woven in diamond twill, which was apparently fashionable at the time.

Scientists using radiocarbon dating believe the woolly tunic was made between 230 and 390 AD and was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the Norwegian Lendbreen glacier, at around 6,560 feet above sea level, where it was found.

Professor Jørgensen described the find as very rare and added that the number of fashion items discovered from the early first millennium AD in Europe can be counted on one hand.

Researchers' examinations of the tunic using a scanning electron microscope revealed that two different types of wool were used to make the garment - wool from an adult sheep and softer lamb's wool.

The scientists said: 'There is no doubt that the wool was 
carefully chosen for both fabrics, and that both quality and natural 
pigmentation were taken into consideration.'

It appears that the tunic was pretty stylish in its day as the fabric was carefully mottled using the light and darker threads to deliberate effect.

It would have fitted a slender man measuring about 5 feet 9 inches tall and the tunic would have been quite short and pulled over the head like a regular jumper, as it has no buttons.

The find is relatively similar to another tunic found more than 150 years ago in a bog at Thorsbjerg,
 Schleswig-Holsten in northern Germany, which is presumed to have 
belonged to an officer as it was found with early weaponry.

Professor Jørgensen said: 'The similarity between the two tunics is
 very interesting as it suggests that a specific style was intended, and
 that this "fashion" was known over a wide area.'

The archaeologists have found approximately 50 fragments of items in the same area as the tunic (pictured) that they will date and analyse and predict they will find many more if the global temperatures rise as predicted. It is hoped the finds will give historians a better grasp on fashion and textiles of the first millennium AD.

Both the tunics were woven in a diamond twill pattern and had been mended in areas, suggesting they were relatively hard-wearing as well as precious.

Professor Jørgensen is unsure if the Norwegian garment was passed down or shared between people, but said the hunter probably looked after the tunic.

She believes it could have started 
out as a sleeveless design that was later adapted, as the first repair 
used a patch from the body section, while a second patch came from a 
different fabric used to make the sleeves.

Despite
 the apparent care of the owner, the archaeologists do not know how the 
jumper was lost on the mountains but speculate the hunter might have 
been caught in a snow flurry or particularly dense fog and was unable to
 find his garment.

A
 number of scientists have admitted that a surprising benefit of global 
warming is the rapid discovery of hidden artefacts in cold regions.

The tunic, which was found in melting snow, has a trendy boat neck and is crafted from wool, woven in diamond twill (pictured), which was apparently popular at the time.

However, the world's glaciers are disintegrating and ice melting so quickly that archaeologists could lose relics exposed to the air if they are nor discovered incredibly quickly.

Human remains and natural materials are most at risk. Wool, features are leather can disintegrate in mere days when freed from the ice, while wood can take a few years to rot, The Guardian reported.

Patrick Hunt of Stanford University, California noted a frighteningly fast rate of thaw in the Alps, where he is looking for artefacts associated with Hannibal's invasion of modern Italy with elephants in 218 BC.

He said: 'This is the first summer since 1994 when we began our field excavations above 8,000ft that we have not been inundated by even one day of rain, sleet and snow flurries. I expect we will see more ice patch archaeology discoveries.'

British scientists have previously claimed that climate change is damaging archaeological treasures that have been preserved for thousands of years.

Experts 
at the University of Edinburgh's Business School  said remains in 
some of the coldest places on earth are becoming exposed as warmer 
temperatures cause ice and hardened ground to thaw.

Dr
 Dave Reay, of the university, said: 'Warming climates are 
expected to lead to more melting ice, and we need to take action to 
safeguard ancient treasures.'Long-term efforts are needed to locate archaeological remains that are at risk, and research how best to care for them.'
