When you live in a place that’s surrounded by nothing but unforgiving rock and gritty sand, it’s tempting to use anything soft as a pillow – including a passing sightseer.

Cruise ship worker Lea McQuillan had only just sat down for a brief rest during a visit to the Antarctic’s barren South Shetland islands when an elephant seal pup waddled over and snuggled up.

The pup, which weighs as much as an adult man, then nodded off, sleeping for two hours before crawling into the water.

Ms McQuillan had ventured on to Elephant Point on Livingston Island with ship’s doctor Helen Willcock to relax after a 14-day cruise. 

The scene was captured by wildlife photographer Roy Mangersnes, who was travelling with them.

He said: ‘Lea was not scared at all. These cubs are extremely curious, but are not threatening. The mother was not around so there was nothing to worry about. These cubs are still suckling and do not have teeth yet.

‘This little guy is just enjoying some peace before he reaches adulthood and has to start fighting for his future.’
