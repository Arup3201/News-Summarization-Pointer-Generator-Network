George Osborne has called on Britain to 'up our game' after claiming the country had lost the sense of ambition and optimism it had in the Victorian age

The Chancellor said the country had become 'defeatist' and had to change its attitude to communist China and its 'staggering' economic rise.

As he prepared to leave Hong Kong after a five-day tour, Mr Osborne claimed Britain had allowed 'the bits that were great' to wither.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he criticised Ed Miliband for describing China as a 'sweatshop' economy and hit back at critics of the regime who claimed it posed a threat to British interests.

'I feel a
bit like, my God, we’ve really got to up our game as a country, and the
whole of the West has to understand what is happening here in Asia,' he said.

'I do think there’s an ambition in the 
country and a sense of optimism and 'can do’ which our country had in 
the Victorian age and had at other points in our history.'

His trip, the first by a senior British politician after a row over David Cameron’s meeting with the Dalai Lama last year, may pave the way for a visit to Beijing by the Prime Minister next year.

Mr Osborne said that thanks to the coalition Britain was recovering the ambition and optimism that marked its economic growth in the 19th century and under Margaret Thatcher.

He added: 'Somewhere along the line in 
Britain there were bits that were great about British industry that we 
allowed to wither.'

Britain could match the energy shown by Chinese development in science and technology and the 'hotbed' of entrepreneurs

He told the Telegraph's Benedict Brogan: 'We’ve got to start by understanding that China is an ancient civilisation with a long and proud history.

'If you start by understanding that and treating that with respect that’s a good place to begin. China is what it is. And we have to either be here or be nowhere.'

Mr Osborne told the paper that he is ready soon to separate the Royal bank of Scotland £50-60 billion in 'bad' assets so that it can return to the private sector.
