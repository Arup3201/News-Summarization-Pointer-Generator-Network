Happy couple: Rebecca Cottam, with her husband Trevor, wears the ring on their wedding day.

A woman has been reunited with her wedding ring more than a month after it was stolen from a gym in Sandy, Utah.

Rebecca Cottam, 29, only managed to retrieve it after striking a deal with the thief, promising not to press charges if she lead her to the ring.

'The most important thing was just to get my ring back,' Cottam said, according to Deseret News.

'I was just willing to do whatever I could. I think she’ll get what’s coming to her in time.

'I just don’t want to be a liar. She’s a thief. I don’t want to be a liar,' said Cottam.

The thief lead Sandy police to a store at The Gateway shopping center in Salt Lake City where they recovered the heirloom diamond.

Cottam said the thief, who has not been named, admitted to selling it to the pawn shop for $200.

She said it made her ‘sick to my stomach’.

The ring's stone once belonged to her husband Trevor's grandmother, Melba Cottam.

Cottam said she was relieved the diamond had not been resold. She said it had only been modified to remove a small flaw.

She had earlier written on her Facebook wall that she feared the pawn shops would ' rip the ring apart and sell the diamonds'.

The story of Cottam and her diamond ring began on August 13 at the Gold’s Gym at 7990 South 1300 East.

Detectives believe the thief likely used bolt cutters to cut through a lock and gain access to Cottam’s belongings.

The next day, Cottam began a social media campaign to recover her ring, which went viral, resulting in thousands of shares on Facebook.

On her Facebook wall she wrote: 'Not giving up hope!!! I'm offering a reward for the return of my ring. The stone belonged to my husband's grandmother! I know you are out there. If there is ANY amount of kindness in you, please turn it in anonymously! Keep my phone, kindle and everything else you stole... just PLEASE return my ring.'

There was no surveillance footage 
available from the initial heist, but a break in the case occurred when 
the thief hit the same gym six days later, according to Deseret News.

Cottam said the woman originally denied 
taking her ring but changed her story after police confronted her with 
surveillance video from another store where she used a gift card found 
in Cottam’s purse.

Cottam promised the thief not to press charges if she would lead her to her ring.

Sandy Police Sgt. Jon Arnold said an outcome like this one – with stolen property like a wedding ring being recovered – is extremely rare.

The moment finger and ring were reunited was so overwhelming for Cottam that she ‘just started bawling’.

‘I was in tears. My hands were shaking.’
