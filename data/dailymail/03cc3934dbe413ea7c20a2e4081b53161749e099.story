A variation on a virtual kidnapping scam that targeted immigrant families is now being tried against affluent parents in Texas and Oklahoma.

Dr Clay Sigmon, a dentist from Del City, Oklahoma, told KFOR of receiving a phone call from a man claiming to be a Mexican cartel member who kidnapped his daughter.

In a call like this, the gang member threatens to cut off the child's fingers and slit their throat unless they receive a cash ransom.

The next voice that is heard is that of a child crying, 'I don't know where I am. They've got me.'

In all likelihood, though, these families' children safe and sound, and the voice on the other line belongs to a stranger.

After he overcame the initial shock, Sigmon realized the voice of the girl crying on the other line was not his daughter and hung up on the hoaxer.

Some have not been so quick, as the FBI in San Antonio say a dentist was taken for more than $1,000 recently, with another physician in Houston losing over $2,000.

Red flags can signal the caller is not who they say they are. The FBI says calls come from a different area code and never from the victim's cell phone, and that scammers only take wire transfers. 

'Virtual kidnappings' have their roots in Mexico, where scammers were able to play off the fear and paranoia caused by actual kidnappings taking place at the hands of cartels and corrupt police.  

Shocked: After overcoming the first few seconds of fear, Dr Sigmon realized the call was fake when he did not recognize the girl's voice on the other line

One investigation that led to arrests and criminal charges actually began as a real kidnapping, when a Fresno woman paid a $2,500 ransom to free her brother-in-law who had been abducted in Tijuana.

Christian Science Monitor reports that after he had been freed, the kidnappers tried to go back to the well for more, and the woman reported the call knowing her brother-in-law was already safe.

Police arrested a married couple at a 7-Eleven who were involved in the scheme, and later arrested four others for a scam that earned $500,000.

In another variation in Washington, D.C., scammers told the families of Central American immigrants that their relatives had been kidnapped while crossing the border.

Officials told the El Paso Times that  currently 'there is nothing to indicate' that the scams are tied to actual cartel activity.
