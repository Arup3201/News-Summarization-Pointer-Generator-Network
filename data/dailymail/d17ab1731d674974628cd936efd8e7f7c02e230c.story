A man has been pictured performing the anti-Semitic 'salute' made famous by Nicolas Anelka in front of the Jewish school where three children were killed in a 2012 massacre.

The photograph shared on social media has helped to fuel anger over the 'quenelle', which was invented by an outspoken comedian accused of espousing extremist views.

The gesture, said to resemble a Nazi salute, was brought to international fame last week when Mr Anelka made it after scoring a goal for West Bromwich Albion.

Outrage: This photograph shows an unidentified man performing the quenelle, an allegedly anti-Semitic salute, outside the Jewish school where three children were killed in 2012

Controversy: Nicolas Anelka made the gesture after scoring against West Ham United on Saturday

The footballer insists he was unaware of the gesture's alleged racist connotations, and only meant to show support for comedian Dieudonné M'Bala M'Bala.

However, numerous photographs have emerged of members of the public performing the 'quenelle' in front of Holocaust memorials, concentration camps and a poster of Anne Frank.

The latest image to spark outrage in France shows an unidentified man doing the gesture at the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse, site of the worst school shooting in the country's history.

Anti-Semitic terrorist Mohammed Merah targeted the school during a gun rampage in March 2012, murdering a rabbi and three children aged three, six and eight.

Friends: Anelka with comedian Dieudonné, who invented the quenelle gesture

In the photograph, which has been widely circulated online in the wake of the Anelka row, the man performing the quenelle is wearing a T-shirt depicting former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

The salute involves extending one arm, as in a Nazi salute, but keeping it by your side as you touch your shoulder with the other arm.

Mr Anelka has refused to apologise for doing the quenelle during a game against West Ham United last Saturday, but has agreed not to repeat the gesture in future.

He claimed the salute was intended to be 'anti-system' and was a sign of his friendship with Dieudonné.

Symbol: Samir Nasri of Manchester City was also pictured doing the quenelle and has since apologised

It has emerged that other sportsmen, including Manchester City's Samir Nasri and basketball star Tony Parker, have been pictured with the comedian performing the gesture.

They all say they were unaware of any anti-Semitic connotations, and Dieudonné himself claims the quenelle is a symbol of defiance.

The comedian has multiple convictions for anti-Jewish hate speech, and has been accused of using his act for 'professional anti-Semitism'.
