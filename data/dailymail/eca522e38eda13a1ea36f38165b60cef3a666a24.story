With modern technology, advancing design and ever-changing style, it's hard to imagine life in some parts of the country 200 years ago. 

But the life at the Foxton Locks Flight doesn't seem to have changed too much, with the historic canal locks bearing a striking resemblance to how they looked during the 19th Century.

Photographs of the locks throughout their history have been released by the Canal River Trust to mark the 200th anniversary of the locks being built.

Built by architect Benjamin Bevan between 1810 and 1814, the ten canal locks in Leicestershire facilitate the Grand Union Canal and are the longest staircase of locks in Britain. 

At the height of the Industrial Revolution they carried huge quantities of goods, such as coal and cotton, between London and the Midlands.Today the canal is more popular among leisure boaters, walkers, canoeists and anglers. 

To mark the occasion visitors are invited this weekend to hear live music and enjoy food stalls as well as watching a parade of historic boats  from Crick in Northamptonshire.

Nigel Crowe, Head of Heritage for the Canal and River Trust said: 'I'm absolutely delighted to see the locks so well looked after. 

 'It's such an interesting site that was badly neglected during the war.' 

The Canal and River Trust has partnered up with local authorities to implement a preservation plan which Mr Crowe said is a 'good' arrangement. 

'We all work together to make sure the locks are preserved properly. It's a site that I and everyone else at the trust is very proud of.'

While the ropes and wheels may have disappeared much of the site remains the same with hundreds of tourists visiting the site every year from all over the country
