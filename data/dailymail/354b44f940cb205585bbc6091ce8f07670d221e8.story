The new King and Queen of Spain have continued their public relations blitz with yet another high profile appearance since they took the throne.

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain today visited an Air Force basic academy in Leon, northern Spain, to oversee a military graduation ceremony.

It was the latest in a series of high profile public appearances the couple have made since they were crowned King and Queen last month.

The two arrived well dressed for the occasion - Felipe VI wore a full military outfit, while the Queen was elegantly dressed in black trousers - and a rather royal looking top.

Queen Letizia has forged a name for herself as something of a fashion icon in Spain, with the mother of two's dress sense followed closely by the public and the press

The couple only took power last month and in accordance with the Spanish Constitution, as Monarch, King Felipe is commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces

Monarchists hope the era only just under way for the new King and Queen will usher in a new era of popularity for the troubled royal household.

Determined to stay in line with the country's austerity measures, the couple and their two daughters - Leonor, eight, and Sofia, seven - held a low-key affair ceremony after which there was a brief military parade to their first official engagement.

It was a sharp contrast to the pomp expected when compared with royal handovers in other countries, to show an appreciation for the fact that more than one in four Spanish workers is jobless despite an incipient economic recovery.

King Felipe's signing in was more of a legal process, attended by lawmakers, high-level politicians and some members of the royal family - including his new Queen - with no foreign leaders invited.

King Felipe and Spain face plenty of problems. The country is struggling to shrug off a double-dip recession and drive down its 26 percent jobless rate. Scandals have tarnished the royal family and fueled campaigns to abolish the monarchy, while influential groups in some Spanish regions continue to push hard for independence.

As soon as he had begun his reign, he has sought to draw a line under Spain's recent past, promising 'a reinvigorated monarchy for new times' and declared his intention to restore trust in the monarchy.

He told crowds in his first public statement as King he felt the suffering of those whose living standards were hurt by the economic crisis. He urged Spaniards to shun resignation and unleash their ambitions and said finding jobs for the unemployed was 'a priority for society and the government.'
