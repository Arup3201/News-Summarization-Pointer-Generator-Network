The rotting carcasses of almost 3,000 'diseased' pigs have been found floating upstream in Shanghai, following a police campaign to curb an illicit trade in infected meat. 

The swollen and distended animals- some of which had  their internal organs visible - have been pulled from the waters since Friday by China's authorities.

It has caused concern amongst Shanghai residents and local media over the possibility of contamination to the city's water supply, though authorities say none has so far been detected.

Revolting images of the carcasses in news reports and online blogs have caused a local outcry against officials.

Lawyer Gan Yuanchun said on his microblog: 'Well, since there supposedly is no problem in drinking this water, please forward this message, if you agree, to ask Shanghai's party secretary, mayor and water authority leaders if they will be the first ones to drink this meat soup?'

On Monday, Shanghai officials said the number of dumped adult and piglet carcasses retrieved had reached 2,813.

The city government, citing monitoring authorities, said the drinking water quality has not been affected. 

Shanghai's Agriculture Committee said authorities do not know what caused the pigs to die, but that they have detected a sometimes-fatal pig disease in at least one of the carcasses.

The disease is associated with the porcine circovirus, which is widespread in pigs but doesn't affect humans or other livestock.

The dumping follows a clampdown on the illegal trade in contaminated pork. 

In
 China, pigs that have died from disease should be either incinerated or
 buried, but some unscrupulous farmers and animal control officials have
 sold problematic carcasses to slaughterhouses.

Shanghai's city government said initial investigations had found the dead pigs had come from Jiaxing city in neighboring Zhejiang province. It said it had not found any major epidemic. 

Huang Beibei, a lifetime resident of Shanghai, was the first to expose the problem when he took photos of the carcasses and uploaded them onto his microblog on Thursday.

'This is the water we are drinking,' Huang wrote. 'What is the government doing to address this?'

His graphic photos apparently caught the attention of local reporters, who followed up. 

Huang said he's most concerned about water safety. 'Though the government says the water is safe, at least I do not believe it - given the number of the pigs in the river. These pigs have died from disease,' Huang said.

The pork harvested from diseased carcasses has ended up in markets in the past.

As
 a food safety problem, it has drawn attention from China's Ministry of 
Public Security, which has made it a priority to crack down on gangs 
that buy dead diseased pigs and process them for illegal profits. 

Zhejiang
 police said on their official website that police have been campaigning
 to rid the market of unsafe pork meat and that the efforts were stepped
 up this winter as Chinese families gathered to celebrate the Lunar New 
Year in February.

In one 
operation last year, police in Jiaxing stamped out a criminal gang that 
acquired and slaughtered diseased pigs. The provincial authorities said 
police arrested 12 suspects and confiscated nearly 12 tons of tainted 
pork meat. 

'Ever since the
 police have stepped up efforts to crack down on the illicit market of 
sick pigs since last year, no one has come here to buy dead pigs, and 
the problem of pig dumping is worse than ever this year,' an unnamed 
villager told the Jiaxing Daily newspaper, which is run by the local 
Communist Party. 

Wang Xianjun, a government worker for Zhulin village, told the newspaper that villagers were breeding too many pigs. 

Wang
 said the village had 10,078 dead pigs in January and another 8,325 in 
February. 'We have limited land in the village,' he said. 'We do not 
have that much land for burial.'

Zheng
 Fengtian, a professor at the School of Agricultural Economics and Rural
 Development at Renmin University in Beijing, acknowledged that there is
 illegal trade in diseased dead pigs in China. 

'According
 to the law, dead pigs must be burned or buried, but if there is not 
enough regulatory monitoring, it's possible some of them will be sold 
into the market at low prices,' he said, adding that it is not known how
 serious the problem is.
