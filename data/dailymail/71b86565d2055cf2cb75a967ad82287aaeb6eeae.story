Sir Bradley Wiggins, who made a silver-medal return to the track in the Commonwealth Games on Thursday, must wait until March to resolve his long-running management dispute.

A High Court date has now been set for the multi-million-pound case brought against Wiggins by agents MTC, whom the cyclist left to join Simon Fuller’s XIX Entertainment.

Wiggins revealed in February 2013 — after his glory year when he won the Tour de France, Olympic gold and BBC Sports Personality of the Year — that he was joining the likes of David Beckham and Lewis Hamilton in Fuller’s all-star set-up, sparking a complex legal fight.

MTC claim to have negotiated Wiggins’s most lucrative contract with Team Sky as well as Fred Perry and Oakley sponsorships and an autobiography. The Wiggins camp allege the agency deal only involved commercial contracts and not his riding agreement with Sky, and that some contracts were arranged by Wiggins’s wife Catherine and friends.

However, Wiggins has never been able to attract the number of endorsements enjoyed by his fellow cycling knight Sir Chris Hoy.

Prince Imran, the jolly Malaysian president of the Commonwealth Federation who threatened to blow the climax of the opening ceremony when he took ages to extricate the Queen’s message from a baton, disarmingly deflected criticism on Thursday by saying it had been a ‘great comedy act’. It didn’t seem funny at the time. 

Meanwhile, the video wall that took up the whole of the south stand at Celtic Park seems to be a game-changer for opening ceremonies, after it so greatly enhanced what was going on in the stadium.

Team England and the Commonwealth Games organisers remained remarkably sanguine when Mo Farah, one of the few A-list track and field stars due to compete in Glasgow, withdrew from the 5,000 metres and 10,000m on the opening day of the Games.

Farah, who missed a big pay day at the Anniversary Games last week to give himself a chance of running in Scotland, suggests there was nothing untoward in his no-show. But it is odd the BBC, who monopolise the Commonwealth Games, spent six months attempting to expose something untoward in Farah’s training methods without finding anything.

There is consternation at the BBC that a job advert for the position of sports editor suggests the successful candidate can choose to live in London or Manchester, when virtually the whole department have had to up sticks to Salford.

The blurb also intimates broadcasting skills can be learned on the job, pointing to another appointment from newspapers.

ECB’s crowd trouble

The poor crowds forecast for the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India are exercising minds at the ECB just as much as the team’s struggles on the field.

England captain Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores are under the closest scrutiny, but England boss Paul Downton and chief selector James Whitaker will feel the heat too if the defeats continue and the cash cow that is Test cricket in this country starts to diminish.

Certainly Downton, who sits in on selection meetings and mingles with players at practice and before matches, is a lot more visible than his successful predecessor Hugh Morris.

Security arrangements for the Commonwealth Games are proving baffling. Miniature bottles of Famous Grouse whisky, included in the media pack, were being confiscated by the military on Thursday when the recipients attempted to re-enter the secure zone where the gifts were given out.

England Rugby 2015 were hoping the new Consumer Act due to go through Parliament before the World Cup would stop touts selling tickets they don’t have and gambling on finding them at a later date to meet demand.

However, it doesn’t look as if there will be any sports clauses in the bill and a real danger of touts derailing the main World Cup ticket sale in September.
