Kieran Richardson was once carried shoulder-high by West Bromwich Albion fans at the Hawthorns following his part in a great escape against relegation.

Ten seasons on, his red card here brought cheer to those same supporters and ultimately provided Alan Irvine with a victory that keeps his job safe.

Richardson was sent off midway through the first half to hand the hosts a golden opportunity that they duly polished when Craig Gardner, a Villa academy graduate, drove home 18 minutes from the end.

For some time it looked as though West Brom’s lack of guile would cost them and the question loomed of whether a goalless draw against ten men would be seen as more damaging than a loss on equal terms in the eyes of chairman Jeremy Peace.

That needs no answer now. Villa’s five-match unbeaten run is ended and West Brom have a first win since November 1. ‘Relief is one of the emotions,’ admitted Irvine. ‘I think everyone assumes it will be easy versus 10 men. But I didn’t think it was a foregone conclusion we’d score.’

Before kick-off, Irvine was aware of the importance of this fixture, both locally and for him professionally. So his selection told a story.

Once again top scorer Saido Berahino was left on the bench. Instead Brown Ideye came in for the injured Victor Anichebe and Silvestre Varela was handed his first start for the club.

The Portugal international was a positive presence throughout. Early on he skipped past Alan Hutton and crossed for Ideye, who was unable to get his head to the ball. 

That would prove a familiar sight: the Nigeria striker, West Brom’s £9million record signing, failing to connect with any clinical effect to the crosses that peppered the Villa box. 

The moment that shaped this match came in the 22nd minute. Richardson allowed the ball to run away from him and, as so often happens, dived to rectify his mistake. Trouble was Stephane Sessegnon had nipped in and the lunge was late and high.

As Sessegnon lay on the floor, referee Mike Dean composed his thoughts, before producing the red card. Villa’s players staged a protest of sorts – ‘Are you mad?’ Richardson could be seen mouthing – but they seemed to accept the inevitable reduction to ten men.

‘In the modern day game if you raise your studs I can see why the ref gave him the card,’ said Lambert. ‘His enthusiasm to win the ball back probably got him sent off.’

The rest of the half was a case of West Brom controlling possession but failing to create clear openings – until five minutes before the interval. 

Sebastien Pocognoli beat Hutton and pulled the ball back to Sessegnon. Guzan blocked the shot, which lacked direction.

Lambert sent on Fabian Delph at half-time for his first game in two months following a dislocated shoulder. Boldly, Gabby Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke stayed up front.

West Brom continued to press. Varela had a volley blocked by Hutton, before sending another chance over. Then he crossed for Ideye, who shot well over.

Berahino got his introduction in the 70th minute and his impact was instant. He sent over a devilish cross that Guzan failed to clear, Sessegnon hit Ideye with his shot and Gardner arrived to thunder the ball in.

With 11 minutes to go Ron Vlaar and Andreas Weimann came on as Villa went three at the back. Benteke very nearly found an equaliser with a smart flick from Ciaran Clark’s pass and should have done better than fire wide when Agbonalhor set him up on the edge of the area in added time.

It will be a while before Irvine is carried shoulder-high at the Hawthorns, but this win saved him from having to leave through the back door.
