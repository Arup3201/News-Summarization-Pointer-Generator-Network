A Californian restaurant has banned crying children from its dining room saying they distract other diners.

The Old Fisherman's Grotto on Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey has installed signs saying children making loud noises are a distraction to other customers.

It adds that children making noise or crying will not be allowed in its dining room.

The children's policy stated on the Old Fisherman's Grotto website, which says that children crying or making loud noises are a distraction to other diners

The restaurant's policy, which is also outlined on its website, has caused controversy among parents on the wharf who say that the signs are offensive.

It is thought the restaurant put up two of the signs two years ago and have only recently added a third.

It states that strollers, high chairs and booster seats will not be permitted in the restaurant.

It then says: 'Children crying or making loud noises are a distraction to other diners, and as such are not allowed in the dining room.'

One customer, Niki Rieve told KSBW that she was turned away from the restaurant because they would not provide her with a high chair for her six-month-old daughter.

She said: 'Usually they cater, at least have a high chair for the child, but it seemed like they didn't want any child. They said the child can't make any noises so they turned us away.'

The Old Fisherman's Grotto on Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, California, which says despite the policy, the business is continuing to grow

But restaurant owner Chris Shake said he is backing the signs and that if customers don't like the policy they can eat elsewhere.

He said: 'Let's put it this way, I haven't had a down year for over 20 years. Our business continues to grow.'

The restaurant, which has won awards for its clam chowder, isn't the only one to have a policy on young customers.

In 2010, the owner of the Olde Salty's in Carolina Beach, North Carolina said they would not tolerate screaming children in their restaurant.

While last year The Sushi Restaurant, which opened in a shopping plaza in Alexandria, Virginia banned children from its dining room all together.
