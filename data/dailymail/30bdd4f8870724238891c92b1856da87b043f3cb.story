Some members use Instagram simply to upload their favourite selfies.

But one grandson has set up an account on the photo-sharing site to be completely selfless.

Zach Belden, from Louisville, Kentucky, created the social media page in tribute to his 80-year-old grandmother, who is dying of cancer.

And since Grandma Betty's diagnosis, the site has attracted thousands of followers worldwide.

'The idea was to start an account for my friends who know Grandma Betty,' the schoolboy told WDRB Kentucky, 'And it turned out to be something everybody started to enjoy.'

He began by posting pictures of Betty and her late husband shortly after being told she had lung cancer.

After the account went viral, Betty says she began feeling like a celebrity every time she gets a new follower.

'We get joy out of listening to her say everyday, "How many more friends do I have today," her granddaughter, Hope Belden said.

Even though they have received thousands of messages of support, and a handful of gifts, Grandma Betty said she hopes the page will give followers some wisdom.

'Maybe they'll learn something from me. I've been here 80 years, maybe they'll learn something good from me,' she said.

Fashionable: The photos are taken in a number of poses, including one with Grandma Betty getting a perm

Alongside the numerous photos on the account, the family have posted videos.

One of the most popular features is Grandma Betty dancing to the hit Pharrell Williams song, 'Happy.'

'I thought that was cute,' she said.

'I can no longer think of that song without thinking of her,' Hope added.

'This is going to be something we're always going to have and something we're always going to remember and definitely cherish forever.

'I'll always have that. And we'll always have the Instagram, no matter what.'

Zach said: 'I'm glad I get to share her story because I want to remember her forever.'
