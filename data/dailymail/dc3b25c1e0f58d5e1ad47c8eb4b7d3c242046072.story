The notorious father jailed for killing his six children in a house fire has been given free false teeth on the NHS, it was claimed today.

Mick Philpott, 57, who is serving life in prison for the manslaughter of six of his 17 children in Derby, has received the treatment at high-security jail HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire.

Like all prisoners, the killer - found guilty along with his wife Mairead of the manslaughter of their children Jade, John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne - receives free dental treatment on the NHS.

He has even written to Mrs Philpott, 33, to tell her how ‘handsome’ he feels with the new teeth - which would have cost most people outside jail hundreds of pounds, according to the Sunday Mirror.

A prison source told journalist Phil Cardy: ‘[Mr] Philpott is over the moon with them, but taxpayers won’t be quite as pleased. Before he was jailed he was too tight to pay for his own dental treatment.

‘Even on his wedding day he went down the aisle with just a mouthful of gums. He lost his teeth because they all rotted away. But now he’s got a full set on the taxpayer.’

In March it was reported that Mrs Philpott, was sentenced to 17 years for manslaughter last year, was reportedly planning to divorce her husband while they were both still behind bars.

It is thought Mrs Philpott - who hopes to be out of jail by her 40th birthday - has been exchanging romantic letters with Paul Mosely, 47, who was also jailed for 17 years for his part in the crime.

His intention was to rescue the sleeping children through an upstairs window but the fire claimed the lives of Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five.

He was sentenced to life behind bars for the crime. The father of 17, who married Mrs Philpott in 2003, used his children to drag in an astonishing £60,000 a year in benefits.

Mr Philpott, who had previously been jailed for stabbing his schoolgirl lover 27 times, wove a web of lies trying to get away with the crime.

He even plotted to 'get rich quick' off generous donations from the local community meant to pay for the funerals of his children. Mrs Philpott is in jail at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey.

The Ministry of Justice referred media enquiries to NHS England. A request for comment has been left with the NHS England press office.
