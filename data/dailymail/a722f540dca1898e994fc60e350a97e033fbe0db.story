Baz Luhrmann's big-screen adaptation of The Great Gatsby this year brought the glamour of jazz age America gloriously to life.

Audiences were dazzled by the bright lights of New York and the palatial mansions of Long Island. However, as these pictures demonstrate, much of what was shown was pure cinematic trickery.

They reveal how, with help from modern technology, a few cars and a group of actors were translated into a teeming metropolitan scene, and how an almost empty field became a sumptuous formal garden.

The stills, released by visual effect supervisor Chris Godfrey, reveal that many of the movie’s most spectacular scenes were, in fact, shot with nothing but a series of blue and green screens in the background. 

Taxi to nowhere: Bustling Broadway was actually created with just a few green screens and less than a dozen cars

Talking to himself: Gatsby, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is seen with friend Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire, in front of Long Island Sound - but in reality it was little more than a blue screen

The vanishing mansion: The horseman is real enough, but the sumptuous estate and perfectly manicured gardens are a CGI sleight of hand

The technique — known as chroma key — is used in TV weather reports to create the illusion of the forecaster standing before an animated map, which is then overlaid on the screen.

Today, thanks to innovations in computer-generated imagery (CGI), backdrops can be created from scratch with the help of 3D modelling programmes similar to those used by architects designing a building.

Impressive as it may be, the method is not without its flaws. Shooting before a screen means that actors must avoid wearing clothes that match it, because everything of that colour will automatically be replaced by background footage.

For all that, chroma key allows directors to take their audiences on dazzling flights of fancy. 

Indeed, those who have seen the new film version of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel (there was a 1974 version with Robert Redford) would struggle to guess that most of The Great Gatsby was shot not in New York State, where Fitzgerald’s tale is set, but in Luhrmann’s native Sydney.

All that jazz: A car full of revellers on the Queensboro Bridge was seen in the film... but all the scenery was added later

Dream home: The palatial mansion home of Gatsby's lover Daisy was conjured up by computer magic

The wheel deal: Jay Gatsby's flamboyant 1929 yellow Duesenberg actually roared around a car park - not the streets of Manhattan
