Has opened up about family Christmases in the Lively household

Says her whole family will be 'wearing Gucci fragrance'

She has become one of the most sought-after actresses and models across the pond after finding fame in hit TV show Gossip Girl.

From her glamorous leap from the face of Chanel to Gucci to her relationship with Ryan Reynolds, the 25-year-old has barely been out of the spotlight this year.

But the stunning blonde from Los Angeles proves she is a far cry from her pretentious on-screen character Serena Van der Woodson in a candid new video interview.

Candid: Blake Lively opened up about family life and how she will be spending Christmas

Family: Blake spoke with great emotion about her family and happy Christmas messages

Speaking about how she will be spending Christmas, the actress said: 'I come from a big family so the holidays is a time when I'm excited to do nothing but spend time with my family

'I love to cook and eat and play games. So much of that is everybody coming together and celebrating so we always cook our meals together and that is such an amazing experience creating something together and breaking bread in your home.

'So much love is poured into your food and so much love pours out,' she said.

In Gossip Girl, Blake plays the upper East Side girl who has everything.

But the real-life American girl isn't hoping for anything fancy or expensive.

Close-knit: Blake and her family are very close and Ryan has also joined them for big meals as seen here

She said: 'Things that last are always the most powerful things, things that last are like memories so whether it's a photo album, or a fragrance.'

Speaking about the best present she has ever received, she said: 'My sister video taped her kids from the moment they woke up to when they went to bed; it was a day in the life 
and because I love them as if they were my own, I actually tell them 
that I'm their mommy.

'It was such an incredible gift, it's something that I can't be there for every day. It was so emotional watching that.

'I think something that gives you a life experience is beyond just a material thing.'

Plug: Blake made sure to plug the Gucci premiere fragrance that she is the face of

Blake, who is the face of Gucci's Premiere perfume, of course makes sure that she gives her signature scent a big push.

'We would all buy each other fragrances in our family because it tells a story of each different time period in your life.

'It's a nice identifier and it's also a little bit of a selfish gift, it's so comforting when you're near someone that you love and you recognise their smell. It's just like "ahh, that's you".'

She added: 'Me and my sisters have the same taste in scent. We are all going to be wearing Gucci, if you were blindfolded in a room you wouldn't be able to tell us apart.'
