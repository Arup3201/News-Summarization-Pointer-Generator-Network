Courtney Love took the stand on Wednesday in her so-called 'Twibel' trial in which she is accused of libeling a lawyer on Twitter.

The Hole frontwoman is being sued by her one-time lawyer, Rhonda Holmes, after Love posted a tweet in 2010 that suggested Holmes had been ‘bought off’.

The emotional musician told her lawyer on Wednesday that she is useless with computers and that she thought that she was just sending a personal message and deleted it when she realized it had been made public.

Courtney Love has been taken to court by her former lawyer in the first ever case of an alleged libel on Twitter going to trial

Love said that her tweet was an exaggeration and through her lawyers questioning argued that the internet is full of opinion.

Holmes’ attorney Mitchell Langberg said Love’s testimony affirmed her intent with the tweet.

'The jury’s really going to have to decide if there’s anything special about Twitter,' Langberg said.

'When
 you make false statements a fact about someone that hurt their 
reputation, are you responsible for them, just like you would be 
anyplace else?'

At the time, Love had retained Holmes and her San Diego firm, Gordon & Holmes, to pursue a fraud case against the executors of her late husband Kurt Cobain’s estate.

Holmes sued Love in May 2011 over the tweet sent from the now suspended @CourtneyLoveUK account.

‘@noozjunkie I was f***ing devastated when Rhonda J Holmes Esq of san diego was bought off @fairnewsspears perhaps you can get a quote,’ she tweeted.

Gordon & Holmes claim Love defamed it online after it stipulated that the singer ‘remain clean and sober’ while it represented her case, reports Spin.

The case dates back to a tweet sent by Love in 2010 in which she suggested Rhonda Holmes, left, had been 'bought off'

Yet according to the complaint, ‘There was never any indication Love honored this condition,’ which allegedly ‘caused Love to become angry with plaintiffs.’

While a number of Twitter-related libel cases have been filed in the past few years - including one in 2009 involving Love that was settled out of court - none before have gone to trial.

When she took the witness stand on Wednesday, Love, 49, said the tweet was merely an opinion and that the internet is full of hyperbole and exaggeration.

Love said she thought she was only tweeting it to two people.

Last month, Love claimed that her tweet was not defamatory because, in the context of the internet, it represents an opinion. However, Judge Michael Johnson did not agree and sent the case to trial.

The
 trial, originally scheduled to finish up by the end of next week, is 
expected to continue for at least a few days beyond that.

The offending tweet was send from the now defunct @CourtneyLoveUK account and the singer now tweets as @Courtney

The verdict in this case could have serious 
repercussions for all Twitter users if Courtney Love is found guilty of defaming 
her former attorney.

‘The Courtney Love Twitter lawsuit is
 monumental because the judge has now determined that tweeting in 
California can potentially give rise to liability under the theory of 
defamation,’ attorney Brian Claypool told ABC.

‘The
 Courtney Love case will set a precedent that will result in, 
potentially, the average person being liable as well,’ he added.

The
 case could also re-write the rules for much-loved celebrity Twitter
 wars that have made headlines over the years such as Miley Cyrus vs. Sinead 
O’Connor and Demi Lovato vs. Perez Hilton.
