A trove of celebrity memorabilia from Judy Garland's Wizard of Oz dress and Marilyn Monroe's will to a slice of cake saved from Charles and Diana's wedding in 1981 is to go under the hammer.

More than 800 artifacts, including hundreds of props and costumes from some of Hollywood's most iconic movies, go on auction in the exclusive Los Angeles suburb of Beverly Hills.

This year marks the 50th anniversary 
of Marilyn Monroe’s death and a number of her iconic items including a 
skirt that was immortalized in the candid photographs taken by John 
Vachon; along with her personal collection make-up in a black check 
make-up bag.

But perhaps one of the most interesting items in the Monroe collection is her last will and testament. In it she directs that $10,000 is bequeathed to her half-sister Bernice Miracle and another $50,000 to her secretary May Reis and 'all her personal effects and clothing' to her acting teacher Lee Strasberg.

She also leaves money to her psychiatrist Dr Marianne Kris.

blockbuster the Wizard of Oz which still has its original pinafore and 
blouse and is expected to fetch $600,000.

A
serigraph print of Leroy Neiman’s Happy Birthday Mr. President is set 
to go for $5,000, and an 8mm film reel of the President’s birthday
