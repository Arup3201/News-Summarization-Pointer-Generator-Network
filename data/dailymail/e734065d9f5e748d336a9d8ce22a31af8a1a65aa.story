France manager Didier Deschamps has launched an attack on Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri's character insisting he lacks 'sincerity'.

The former Arsenal player has not featured for France since November 2013 and has endured frosty relations with the national side since he was handed a three-match ban for his behaviour during Euro 2012.

Nasri was then left furious after he was omitted from France's World Cup squad last year despite playing a key role in City's title-winning campaign.

The 27-year-old retired from international football following the tournament in Brazil and criticised Deschamps again in an interview with L'Equipe earlier this month, referring to the former midfielder as a 'joker' and a 'hypocrite'.

And now the 46-year-old has hit back by claiming Nasri refused to talk with him and insists France are doing just fine without him.

'People need to know that, in the autumn of 2012, I decided to call him to discuss stuff with him,' he told RMC Sport. 'He refused to listen. He did not want to discuss anything.

'I was waiting for him to want to talk, but he did not meet my expectations in sport. Apparently, he says he is happier without the France team. Without him, France are continuing perfectly fine.

'If a person who is an example of sincerity and frankness told me something, I'd consider it, but Nasri is not that type of person.'
