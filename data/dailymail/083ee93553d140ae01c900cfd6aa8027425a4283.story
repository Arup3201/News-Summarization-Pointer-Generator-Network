We're in Accrington, home to one of the world’s biggest pie manufacturers, but the only thing on the menu for David ‘Bumble’ Lloyd is a cold, hard serving of torture.

At the bottom of a cul-de-sac his son Ben has converted his garage into a gym with a treadmill, bike and stacks of weights. A neighbour unloading his shopping from a car peers inside quizzically. What is one of Britain’s national sporting treasures doing with a 10kg weight dangling from his head?

‘I know what people will be thinking: “What’s a man who’s turning 68 in a few months with a snapped achilles and a titanium knee playing at?”,’ says Bumble.

Twice a week he is put through his paces by Ben, who owns a personal training business. He points to a poster of Arnold Schwarzenegger on the wall, all oiled, bronze skin and rippling muscles.

‘There’s absolutely zero chance of me looking like that,’ he says in that distinctive East Lancashire drawl, but he does admit that vanity has played a part in this mission.

Shortly after this session Bumble, a former Lancashire and England cricketer and coach, flew to Australia where he is commentating on the one-day international tri-series for Sky Sports with Nasser Hussain, David Gower, Andrew Strauss, Shane Warne, Michael Holding and Sir Ian Botham.

‘Being on TV you’ve got to look right,’ says Bumble, ‘I’m the oldest in our group and they’re very opinionated blokes, they don’t hold back on your appearance.

‘I realised I was getting out of shape because I wasn’t able to run any more with my knee so I wanted to do something about it’

Sportsmail columnist Bumble will be in Australia for two and a half months, keeping up his fitness regime with Ben advising him by email.

‘It’s a long time to be away but I enjoy it,’ says Bumble. We don’t all socialise together. My mates are Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Ian Ward and Andrew Strauss, that’s our little combo. The other lads are into a bit of fine dining, we don’t see them. They have jus and foam and we have curry and a pint.’
