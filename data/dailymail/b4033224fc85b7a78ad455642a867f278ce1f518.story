Monty and his beloved dog Nigel who Noel was able to save from being put down

Rufus the rabbit should not be here.

The three-month-old pet fell out of his hutch and shattered his leg, a fatal injury for most rabbits as the bones are too small to fix.

They are usually put to sleep. But Rufus is bouncing with health, and eager to explore. Vet Noel Fitzpatrick holds him securely.

'Rufus thinks he's fixed and he wants to hop around the room... but Rufus hasn't seen the X-ray pictures.'

Those X-rays are extraordinary, proving why animal lovers know Noel as the Supervet. Rufus has had two metal plates implanted in his leg, fixed with 12 screws in a bone thinner than a matchstick. 'It was like drilling into cottage cheese,' Noel says candidly.

Noel, whose work is explored in a new Channel 4 series, is on a mission to rescue animals like Rufus, the ones that conventional veterinary science agrees cannot be saved.

His signature is the bionic op, where mechanical body parts are integrated with the animal's living skeleton to replace a paw or a leg.

This pushes medical technology to the limit. 'The op I do isn't yet performed on humans,' he says. 'I hope the technology will one day help human amputees such as war veterans.'

At the suggestion that people should get this revolutionary technology before animals, he becomes hyper-voluble.

'For a long time humans have taken for granted that they can have surgery made possible by experiments on animals, but the animals don't benefit. My purpose is to tell people about unconditional love for animals. This is the essence of life.'

In the first episode of Supervet, an eight-year-old Labrador called Scooby is referred to him. Scooby has cancer, with a leg tumour that has left his bone looking moth-eaten.

The dog is in pain, but the family don't want to lose him - their son Freddie, 11, is devoted to his pet and his dad David is in tears too.

There is no false hope for this family, and some scenes make difficult viewing. By amputating the diseased leg, Noel can bring Scooby a stay of execution - fitting an expensive prosthetic would bring unnecessary suffering.

But on three legs, Scooby is able to enjoy life again. 'It's a big responsibility,' Noel admits. 'You're holding people's emotions in the palm of your hand.'

Weekend's gardening expert Monty Don has personal experience of Noel's miracle touch. His golden retriever Nigel was paralysed when he burst a spinal disc and faced being put to sleep.

In desperation, and on the recommendation of a friend, Monty contacted Noel - and received a return email within minutes: 'Bring the dog to me.'

Six days later, after an intensive course of hydrotherapy and drugs, Nigel was back on all four paws. 'Noel is a brilliant technician but also a deeply emotional man,' says Monty, with unfeigned admiration.

Whether it's a cat with metal blades for back legs or a tortoise with a wheel on his shell, Noel wants to restore them to health - even if he has to invent a new solution. 'People said this was impossible,' he says, surveying his operating rooms. 'But everything is impossible until we make it possible.'

Supervet starts on Channel 4 in May.
