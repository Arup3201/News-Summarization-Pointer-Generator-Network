Men may think it is the height of fashion, but the trend of wearing loafers without socks could leave them with fungus-infested feet, experts are warning.

The look, favoured by the likes of Ryan Gosling and Jude Law, is causing  a dramatic rise in cases of bad foot odour and cases of athlete’s foot.

Recent statistics have shown that sales of products to remedy the embarrassing problems have shot up by over ten per cent.

Not wearing socks causes sweat to seep directly into the shoe's 
leather, which turns the inside of the shoe into a breeding ground for bacteria.

This, combined with high moisture levels, creates a bad smell and in many cases triggers the itchy fungal infection known as athlete's foot.

Online pharmacy Chemist Direct has reported a surge in sales of foot deodorants and perfumed insole to mask unpleasant shoe smells.

Pharmacist Omar El-Gohary says that his team have received a steady flow of enquiries from customers over the past month asking about how they can minimise foot odour when wearing shoes without socks.

‘While traditionally we always see a spike in sales as the summer foot ware season begins, the latest fashions often affect demand for certain treatments, he said.

As the feet contain more sweat glands than anywhere else in the body, this makes them more prone to sweating. But experts say there are a number of ways to prevent this. 

Fashion faux pas: Men who are following the trend are giving themselves smelly, fungus-infested feet. Pharmacists say that to prevent odour developing it is important to alternate shoes so the sweat can dry out

Mr El-Gohary explains: ‘Wearing the right socks can help absorb sweat and keep the feet dry.

'People should use cotton over nylon, and make sure these are changed daily to avoid a build-up of bacteria.

‘Try alternating between different shoes daily to ensure that they have ample time to dry off in between use.  

He added: ‘If you still have problems consider using a deodorant on feet, a foot spray, or medicated deodorising insoles.

'Treating the feet with an antibacterial wash for a few minutes twice a day can also help.’
