Arsenal have confirmed the appointment of World Cup winning fitness coach Shad Forsythe as they take significant steps towards preventing last season's injury woes.

Forsythe, who was part of Germany's triumphant Brazil 2014 campaign, joined up with the Gunners squad during their recent tour of New York before travelling with the team to Austria for a pre-season training camp.

A series of injury problems last term raised question marks over the Gunners' training methods at their London Colney HQ.

Manager Arsene Wenger revealed last year how the club had started a review of their procedures following an accumulation of injuries that disrupted their Premier League title challenge.

Forsythe, who will take the match-day warm-ups, will work in tandem with the club's current fitness specialist Tony Colbert.

The American already has a close working relationship with the club's German trio Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski following his role with the German FA.
