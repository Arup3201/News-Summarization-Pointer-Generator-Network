Jermain Defoe will make his home debut when Sunderland take on Fulham in the FA Cup Fourth Round on Saturday.

The 32-year-old – signed from Toronto earlier this month – made his Black Cats bow during last weekend’s 2-1 defeat at former club Tottenham.

But Defoe will now run out at the Stadium of Light for the first time this weekend.

‘Jermain will probably play,’ said assistant boss Charlie Oatway.

‘He looks good in training and although he had an injury before he came here, he is ticking over nicely.

‘We need to be careful with him but I am sure he will take part in some capacity on Saturday.’

Meanwhile, Lee Cattermole, Adam Johnson and Wes Brown are all set to miss the game.

Cattermole and Brown are both carrying minor knee injuries, while Johnson is struggling with a calf problem.

Oatway added: ‘There are one or two issues on the injury front.

‘Adam has a bit of a calf problem, Wes has a knock to his knee and Lee has also got a bit of a problem with his knee. We are still monitoring those.

‘Lee will be struggling for the weekend but it is not a major concern. We are confident he will be ready for next week.’
