Presumably by the same logic that decrees all elephants are scared of mice, towering Stoke City forward Peter Crouch is 'petrified' of hamsters.

The surprising revelation was made by the former England star's wife, Abbey Clancy, who posted a photo online of the beast in question. 

She said: 'This is our tiny baby hamster Katie who my husband is petrified of!!!'

But the 33-year-old isn't the only famous footballer to suffer from animal phobias. 

David Beckham admitted to being scared of a frog during an expedition to the Amazon while former Ipswich town and Charlton Athletic midfielder Matt Holland once said he was scared of 'most animals' and won't allow cats or dogs in his house.

The former Tottenham and Liverpool man does apparently have a soft spot for some animals, though. 

Shortly before Christmas Merseyside Dogs Home announced that they had received a donation from Crouch and Clancy.
