Thanksgiving at the Margolies house is going to be awkward this year.

Marjorie Margolies, a former congresswoman and mother-in-law to former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, crashed and burned in a bid to return to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, losing her Democratic primary in a landslide.

Her epic Pennsylvania loss to state Rep. Brendan Boyle came despite campaign fundraising appearances by both Bill and Hillary Clinton, who couldn't push her above a 27 per cent showing in a four-way race.

Margolies has courted controversy since 1993 when, in her first and only term in Congress, she cast the deciding vote in favor of then-President Bill Clinton's tax-raising 1993 budget.

Happy couple: Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky merged the two political families with troubled pasts, and Marc's mother's political flame-out will add new tensions

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton turned an April fundraiser for Margolies into a mini campaign launch for herself, raising $200,000 for her son-in-law's mother but test-ballooning 2016 campaign issues at the same time

Republicans chanted 'Bye bye Marjorie' on the House floor, knowing her political life would take a hit since she had promised her constituents that she would never raise their taxes.

Shortly after she lost her seat in the 1994 midterm election that swept Newt Gingrich and more than 50 other conservatives into power, she got a consolation prize in the form of a $600,000 grant for her charity, Women's Campaign International, from Bill Clinton's USAID.

Part of Margolies' political baggage was linked to that charity.

In 2001 after her husband, former Democratic Rep. Ed Mezvinsky, was indicted for investor fraud, Margolies lost everything – her property was liquidated to reimburse her husband's victims more than $10 million, and a judge refused to let her declare bankruptcy.

She then doubled her own salary into six-figure territory, made a move to pay for a mansion for her to live in and billed it for a leased car.

She also reportedly forced the charity's staffers to double as personal assistants to help her at a university where she taught.

Bill and Hillary Clinton both personally headlined fundraisers for Margolies, and they appeared together in a campaign commercial made near the end of the primary run.

Hillary's appearance in April, however, appeared less focused on Margolies than on herself. The candidate didn't show up, and Mrs. Clinton road-tested campaign themes for the 2016 presidential election.

In contrast, the power couple made nearly a dozen appearances last year in Virginia to help former Democratic National Committee chair Terry McAuliffe win a hotly contested governor's race.

A handful of other marquee November races took shape Tuesday night as Republicans seek a six-seat flip this year to retake the U.S. Senate

Kentucky

Senate
 Minority Leader Mitch McConnell cruised to victory over tea party 
challenger Matt Bevin, a political neophyte who never had a chance after
 he was caught speaking to a pro-cockfightnig rally.

McConnell
 was a gracious winner: He needs to be. Facing popular state Attorney 
General Alison Lundergan Grimes in November will force the five-term 
incumbent to unite a fractured GOP, many of whose voters see him as a 
flexible moderate with limited conservative credentials.

Grimes 
hopes to unseat the Republicans' most powerful senator, even if it's a 
consolation prize in an otherwise dismal year for Democrats.

Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky wed in 2010; his mother Marjorie Margolies (L) lost her bid to return to Congress in a dramatic primary drubbing on Tuesday

Oregon Republican Monica Wehby (2nd L) won her Senate nomination despite separate domestic harassment accusations leveled against her in the past by an ex-husband and a former boyfriend; early voting by mail helped her collect support before the scandal broke

Georgia

In a hyper-competitive Senate race, businessman
 David Perdue topped the field of seven Republicans and a more 
conservative House member, Jack Kingston, finished a close second. The 
two will meet in a July runoff for the GOP nomination.

McConnell cruises: The Senate minority leader, shown voting with nis wife -- former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao --  made easy work of his tea party challenger, and then quickly called for party unity in order to hold on to his seat in November

Tea party-supported candidates Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, both members of the House who sought to leap to the North side of the U.S. Capitol, finished at the bottom of the heap and will likely exit Congress entirely.

The winner of July’s runoff election will face Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn, whose father Sam Nunn was a popular U.S. senator who often won re-elections by landslide margins.

Oregon

Dr. Monica Wehby overcame late-stage accusations about past domestic disputes to capture the GOP Senate nomination.

Police reports surfaced this month showing that her ex-husband and a former boyfriend both called police with claims that she had harassed them.

The boyfriend, a timber company executive who later funded a super PAC attacking Wehby's main challenger, state Rep. Jason Conger, and later said he regretted blowing the whistle on her, and that his claims at the time were heat-of-passion exaggerations

Oregon voters participate heavily in early mail-in voting, raising the possibility that Wehby's victory was significantly aided by voters who cast ballots before her scandal broke in the news. But now the issue threatens to damage her chances against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley in November.
