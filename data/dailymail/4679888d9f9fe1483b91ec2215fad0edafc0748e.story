Team news

West Ham

West Ham have early-season injury problems and could be without as many as six first-team players when they welcome Southampton to Upton Park on Saturday.

Diafra Sakho scored on his home debut against Sheffield United on Tuesday but was substituted with a back complaint and is now a doubt, with Matt Jarvis (thigh), Carl Jenkinson and James Collins (both hamstring) all ruled out by manager Sam Allardyce. 

Thumbs up from me: But despite scoring his first West Ham goal, Diafra Sakho is set to be ruled out injured

Captain Kevin Nolan (shoulder) and club-record signing Andy Carroll (ankle) are out for longer, with many of the side who sat out the Capital One Cup defeat to the Blades likely to return.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins, Burke, Demel, Potts, Noble, Kouyate, Poyet, Diame, Morrison, Downing, Vaz Te, Cole, Sakho, Zarate, Valencia.

Southampton

Southampton midfielder Lloyd Isgrove is almost certain to miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to West Ham.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman has revealed Isgrove is 'not in a good physical way to play' after lasting only 30 minutes of the Capital One Cup tie against Millwall.

Off the mark: Graziano Pelle (left) is expected to retain his striking role after scoring against Millwall

Otherwise Koeman has a fully fit squad to select from with no fresh injury concerns.

Provisional squad: Forster, K Davis, Clyne, Yoshida, Fonte, Hooiveld, Bertrand, Schneiderlin, S Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Ward-Prowse, Taider, Cork, Tadic, Pelle, Gallagher, Gardos.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

West Ham have lost only two of their last 11 Premier League games against Southampton and are unbeaten in the last five.

Saints have scored exactly one goal in five of their last six Premier League games against West Ham.

None of West Ham’s last 17 Premier League games have ended level (W8 L9)

The Hammers have conceded only eight goals in their last nine Premier League home games.

Saints have taken only four points from their last five Premier League away games (W1 D1 L3).

Long time coming: Southampton haven't won at West Ham since James Beattie scored in the final minute to seal a 1-0 win over the Hammers in December 2002

Shane Long has scored only two goals in his last 14 Premier League appearances.

Last weekend, Carlton Cole scored in his 12th separate Premier League campaign.

Southampton have claimed 30 points in 2014, just one fewer than Manchester United.

West Ham have drawn only one of their 21 Premier League games in 2014 so far.
