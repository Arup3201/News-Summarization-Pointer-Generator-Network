Tim Howard has urged Everton’s fans to be patient and accept that manager Roberto Martinez will not switch to a more direct brand of football.

During the last home game against Queen Park Rangers, the Goodison Park crowd was noticeably tense and anxious as Everton’s players moved the ball around and there was a point when one backpass to Howard was greeted with noisy discord.

Everton won plaudits last season for the style of football they played under Martinez as they accrued a club-record points tally (73) in the Barclays Premier League and returned to Europe for the first team in five years.

Things have not been so straightforward this time around, as Everton’s form has been erratic and the tension among supporters is as much to do with the club’s position in the table as it is with the slow tempo of their play.

Howard, though, has explained that Martinez will not be abandoning his principles just to get a few results on the board and he accepts that could mean the atmosphere at Goodison being prickly, starting this afternoon against Stoke. ‘Winning cures everything,’ said Howard. ‘If you could pick the ball up and throw it in with your hands, then people would cheer for that. When wins aren’t coming as regularly as you would hope, there is an edginess.

‘It doesn’t matter whether you are kicking the ball up in the air or passing it on the floor. 

'The fans want wins but, trust me, we want them even more. We are not robots. We hear the crowd. But we are a passing team and we are not going to get away from it. Roberto doesn’t bat an eye at it.

But Martinez has said that the team's style of play is not to blame, and that his players need to perform better

‘He encourages us to pass the ball and it is proven we can win games that way. He has been in charge for 18 months and it has been very positive. There will be no change. I love these fans and they are passionate. But I fight with my brother, too. Do you know what I mean?

‘You don’t always have to agree. I have always had a good rapport and banter with them. That will never change.’

This is Howard’s ninth season on Merseyside but there is no sense that he is approaching the end of the line in terms of contributing; he has been one of Everton’s more key performers this year and his durability and consistency means he has long since paid back the £3.5million it cost to sign him.

He arrived at Everton, initially on loan, from Manchester United under a cloud as his form had tailed towards the end of his spell at Old Trafford. Returning to America, however, was never on the agenda for a man who will make his 371st appearance for Everton on Boxing Day.

‘Too many US players do that,’ said the 35-year-old. ‘When the going gets tough, the manager changes, they get taken out of the team and they hit a low. The first instinct is to go back to America. That is why most US players fail. I was always going to make it here.

‘I knew I had to get my career back on track, so there was a lot of stuff there in that first year for me to deal with. But my self-belief never wavered. It was just a question of taking my chance and putting things right.’
