An Indian woman was clawed by a tiger in the first known case of its kind - because it had no teeth to bite with.

Tigers usually kill by biting the neck, but the 34-year-old woman was clawed to death in the rare case. 

It is believed the tiger's teeth had fallen out or were not functional, according to findings published in the Legal Medicine Journal.

The woman had been collected collecting tendu leaves in the Bramhapuri forest when the Royal Bengal tiger pounced.

Others attempted to distract the tiger by throwing stones when they heard the woman's cries, but she had already received fatal injuries.

An autopsy revealed multiple fatal and non-fatal injuries caused by tiger claws - while characteristic injuries due to the tooth impacts were absent.  

The tiger itself was found dead the next day around four kilometres from the scene of the attack. 

Its paws matched prints taken near the scene and it had no functional teeth. It is believed the tiger had been hungry and saw the woman as easy prey.

India is home to more than half of the 3,200 tigers believed to be left in the wild in the world.

Their numbers are also dwindling fast because of deaths at the hands of poachers, who target the creatures for their skin, bones, teeth and claws.
