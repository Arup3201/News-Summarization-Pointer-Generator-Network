Shortages of basic goods  in crisis-hit Venezuela has created a lucrative new profession... queuing to buy things for other people.

The country is experiencing a recession triggered in part by a scarcity of hard currency - which limits imports of essential goods.

As a result, there are shortages of nearly a third of all basic goods and as well as tumbling oil prices, inflation ballooned to 64% last year.

Krisbell Villarroel is one of many people who make a living by waiting in line to buy everything from milk and sugar to diapers and shampoo.

She then sells the products to clients who pay her for the time she spends standing in queues.

The 22-year-old single mother of two small children in Caracas, told AFP: 'Every day, I have to get up at two in the morning and call my friends to find out where things are for sale or what is for sale.

'That is how I spend my day. I get out of the first line at 10:00 am and then perhaps go to another to see what they are selling.

'In one store, I might get milk, sugar or coffee, but in another - flour, rice, diapers or shampoo.'

She said her customers are families who do not have the time or really the need to wait in line, such as business people who can afford to pay someone else to do it for them.

Each day, she makes between 600 and 1,200 bolivars per shopping assignment (which is 3.6 to 7.1 dollars at the black market exchange rate).

She earns at least 13,200 bolivars a month (about $80) by reselling items to her customers - more than some university professors make.

The country's economic woes have triggered severe shortages of some staple products, with government-controlled supermarkets now limiting the amount of certain products customers can purchase

But she adds it is hard to juggle this kind of work with raising small kids and she is sometimes forced to take with her to the stores.

'No one lets me cut in front of them. I have to be there and it's hard because the kids are restless and get tired,' she said.

At times she negotiates with informal vendors who make a point of always being first in line. 

She pays them for their spot and sells them part of her loot because, as she says, 'everything has a price.'

But waiting in line at night is risky in a crime-ridden nation with the second highest murder rate in the world, at 58 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.

Ms Villarroel insists she is not breaking the law.

'If this problem of the lines is resolved I would have to find another job in order to look after my daughters. I am raising them alone, and that is why I do it. There are many women like me,' she added.

Some restaurant owners have employees whose only job is to wait in line to buy food to put on the menu

'If I want 10 packages of cornmeal, why can I only have four? It should not be that way,' she said, referring to rationing imposed by stores.

And several restaurant owners in the Venezuelan capital say they have employees whose only job is to wait in line at supermarkets and stores to buy food to put on the menu. 

In recent days, as long, slow moving lines formed at stores and some fights broke out, the government has ordered security forces to guard state-owned and private supermarkets.

Some pro-government state governments have even banned people from lining up at night outside stores.

Venezuela gets 96% of its foreign currency from oil and 2015 has already seen a sharp fall in oil prices.

This could make shortages and rationing at stores even worse in the coming months.  

The government of Nicolas Maduro says the country is at 'economic war' triggered by the opposition and by business people bent on destabilizing his administration.

But many economists say the model Maduro inherited from his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, of currency and price controls has been a failure and accentuated the country's dependency on oil as a main source of revenue.
