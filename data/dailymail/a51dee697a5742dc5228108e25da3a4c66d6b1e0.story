Samsung can sell its latest iPad rival in most of Europe again after a German court yesterday lifted most of an injunction it had imposed at Apple's request.

But just hours after the ban was lifted, Apple faced accusations of misrepresenting the Galaxy Tab's similarity to its iPad in a legal document that helped 
gain the original injunction.

A comparison image taken from page 28
of a filing made by Apple's lawyers featured a 'squashed' picture of 
the Galaxy Tab that looks identical in size and shape to the iPad.

In reality, the Galaxy Tab is far narrower than the iPad.

Apple is one participant in a web of litigation among phone makers and software firms over who owns patents used in smartphones, as rivals aggressively rush into the smartphone and tablet market.

Complicating things between Apple and Samsung is the pair's $5billion-plus commercial relationship, which some analysts think might be at risk.

Samsung, for instance, counts Apple as its biggest customer, making chips and other parts central to Apple's mobile devices.   

The well-reviewed Galaxy Tab 10.1 was only recently launched in Europe and is in the early stages of being rolled out. For now, the iPad is the market leader.   

Competing products including Research In Motion's PlayBook and Motorola's Xoom have received lukewarm reviews, while Hewlett Packard's TouchPad is a late entrant in the market, which already has more than 100 devices, mostly running on Android.  

Meanwhile, a U.S. trade agency is also set to review Apple's patent-infringement complaint against Taiwanese phone market HTC Corp.

Apple had said Samsung's Galaxy line of 
mobile phones and tablets 'slavishly' copied the iPhone and iPad. It has
sued in the U.S., Australia and elsewhere.

But a Dusseldorf regional court 
yesterday said it was questionable whether its authority extended to 
international companies operating outside Germany, so it restricted a 
preliminary ban imposed last week on Samsung Electronics to Germany.

Samsung's Galaxy Tab line of tablet 
computers is considered the most credible alternative to Apple's iPad, 
which has taken the market by storm, selling about 30million since its 
launch a year and a half ago.

Apple and others have moved 
aggressively to defend their intellectual property in maturing markets, 
especially against Google's Android software platform, on which the new 
Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet is built.

Android, a latecomer to the mobile 
market, has become a target by rapidly turning into the world's most 
popular smartphone platform.

Google is relatively defenceless because it owns few wireless patents, in contrast to older rivals.

However, Google yesterday announced a
deal to buy Motorola Mobility, the descendant company of cellular phone
pioneer Motorola, for $12.5billion, largely for its vast patent 
library.

The Dusseldorf court said its ban 
still applied to Germany, and also to the German unit of Samsung, 
Samsung GmbH, throughout the European Union.

A hearing in the case is now due next week.

Samsung said in a statement: 'We look
forward to the opportunity to reassert our intellectual property rights
at the hearing scheduled on August 25.'

Samsung has been locked in a battle with Apple over smartphone and tablet patents since April.

The Galaxy gadgets are seen as among the biggest challengers to Apple's mobile devices, which have achieved runaway success.

In
Australia, Samsung has agreed to show Apple an Australian version of 
the Galaxy Tab 10.1 one week before its launch there, a Samsung 
spokesman said.
