Former Fulham midfielder Urby Emanuelson has joined Ashley Cole at Italian giants Roma.

The ex-Dutch international arrives in the Italian capital on a free transfer following his release from AC Milan at the end of last season.

Emanuelson has agreed a one-year deal with the Champions League qualifiers, although there is an option to extend the contract for another year.

Deal: Roma have signed 28-year-old midfielder Urby Emanuelson on a free transfer from AC Milan

Familiar face: Emanuelson played 13 times while on loan at Fulham during the 2012-13 season

Flying in: Emanuelson was pictured arriving at Fiumicino Airport near Roma ahead of the deal

Contract: Emanuelson has agreed a one-year deal with the option of an extra season

He spent six months on loan at Fulham in 2013, playing 13 times and scoring once.

The 28-year-old was also capped 16 times for Holland between 2006 and 2012.

Roma, who finished runners-up in Serie A last season behind champions Juventus, signed Cole on a free transfer from Chelsea earlier in the week.

They also completed the loan signing of Turkey midfielder Salih Ucan from Fenerbahce as they look to strengthen their squad for Europe's elite competition.

Done deal: Ashley Cole signs a two-year deal with Roma after leaving Chelsea

New start: The former England defender was a free agent after leaving Chelsea
