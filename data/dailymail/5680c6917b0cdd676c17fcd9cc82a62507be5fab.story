It's a cracker! Comedian Frank Carson has died of stomach cancer at his Blackpool home

Comedian Frank Carson died yesterday after a battle with stomach cancer. He was 85.

The Irishman, famed for his catchphrases ‘It’s a cracker’ and ‘It’s the way I tell ’em’, passed away surrounded by his extended family at his home in Blackpool.

He had been ill for five years with heart problems and had suffered a hernia and a knee replacement.

Last August he had a tumour removed from his stomach, but just before Christmas the cancer returned.

He worked until a few months before his death, taking part in around 80 events a year. His last stand-up performance was in November.

In a statement, his family said the funnyman was heading off 'for his final gig'.

They said: 'He went peacefully at his home in 
Blackpool surrounded by his greatest fans - his extended family. We will
be taking him home to Belfast to lay him to rest and celebrate his 
joyful life.

'It's quieter down here now. God help them up there!'

Carson, who once joked with the Pope that he would meet Elvis when he died, grew up in a deprived area of north Belfast known as Little Italy.

The son of a binman, he worked as a plasterer and electrician before joining the Parachute Regiment. He served three years in the Middle East in the 1950s before turning to showbusiness.

Starting his career in pubs and clubs, Carson became famous after winning the ITV  talent show Opportunity Knocks. He became a household name after becoming a regular on The Comedians, where he appeared alongside the likes of Bernard Manning.

His charity work led to him being made a Knight of St Gregory by Pope John Paul II in 1987, one of the highest honours in the Catholic Church.

In an interview with the Daily Mail in 2008, Carson told of meeting the Pope: ‘He kissed me and said I was a wonderful man. I was in there for 17 minutes – the priests time it. President Reagan only got 11, so that was nice.’

Carson also dedicated much of his life to
looking after his wife Ruth, who had serious eyesight problems, with 
his sons Tony and Aidan and daughter Majella. In the 2008 interview, 
Carson also said he never worried about his health or getting old.

He
said: ‘It’s never occurred to me to worry about my health, or that I’ll
get old, or that people will stop laughing at me. There’s three things 
you can be sure of in life  –  death, taxes and, if you’re with Frank 
Carson, a bloody good laugh, ha ha.’

In the 1970s, he starred alongside Charlie Williams, Bernard Manning, Mike Reid and Jim Bowen in ITV show The Comedians.

Favourite: Carson was a regular guest on children's TV show Tiswas in the late '70s

He also appeared on TV shows Who Do You Do?, Tiswas and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club.

Tributes
to the funnyman poured in last night. Former chat show host Sir Michael
Parkinson said: ‘He was a good comic and great company.

'He represented 
that front-of-cloth comedy, it’s a different genre from the kind of 
comedy that we have today, where younger and smarter comedians play big 
halls – he was a club comic.

And Sir Bruce Forsyth said: ‘The only trouble with Frank, as far as I’m concerned, is that he made me laugh too much.’

Tribute: Anthony McPartlin said he was 'sad' to hear of Carson's passing

Others paid tribute to him on Twitter, which included Lenny Henry, Tony Blackburn and Anthony McPartlin.

McPartlin
tweeted: 'Sad news about Frank Carson. Had the pleasure of working with
him and he was a real gent. Very funny man. Thoughts are with his 
family.'

Remembering one of
the comedian's jokes, Henry said: 'Fella wnt in2 B&Q - He says: "I 
want some nails" - the guy said: "How long d'you want em?" Fella said "I
wanna keep em" Frank Carson R.I.P.'

In an interview last year, Carson admitted he had been struggling with health problems for some time.

Famous friends: Carson with Angela Rippon in 1996. Tributes to the funnyman poured in

'It's the way I tell 'em': Carson travelled all around the UK performing throughout the years

He told the BBC: 'I have had a bad five years.

'First it was the pacemaker, then it was a new knee, then I had a hernia and then of course I had this problem (cancer).'

His friend, journalist Eddie McIllwaine: 'He met the present Pope (Benedict XVI) 
and the Pope said "did you ever meet Elvis Presley" and Frank said "no I
have not but it won't be long now."'

With
another one of his catchphrases 'It's the way I tell 'em', Carson 
travelled all around the UK performing throughout the years.

He is survived by his widow Ruth, daughter Majella, sons Tony and Aidan and 10 grandchildren.
