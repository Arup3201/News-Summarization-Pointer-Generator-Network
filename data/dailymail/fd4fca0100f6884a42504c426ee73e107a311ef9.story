A 19-year-old man has admitted to running a suburban 'stash house' for a Mexican drug cartel after the enterprise came to light when they allegedly kidnapped and tortured two teens.

Antonio Navarro, 19, is one of four men accused of kidnapping two Minneapolis 
teens whom they suspected of stealing drugs and money from the house in a 
quiet St. Paul neighborhood.

Navarro pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute methamphetamine on Tuesday, clearing the way for the state to proceed on charges including kidnapping, assault and robbery, the Pioneer Press reported.

'Stash house': Four men allegedly kidnapped two teens at gunpoint and tortured them in this home in St Paul, Minnesota in April. The men believed the boys had stolen drugs from them

Navarro and Juan Ricardo Elenes Villalvazo, 32, are accused of keeping the 'stash house' for the cartel, though court documents don't say which one and federal prosecutors declined to comment.

Drugs were delivered to the rental house and hidden there along with cash, prosecutors said.

Jesus Ramirez, 31, and Jonatan Delgado Alvarez, 22, both of Los Angeles, flew to the Twin Cities in April after meth and $200,000 in cash were stolen from the house, the federal indictment said.

Prosecutors say all four men kidnapped two Minneapolis teens, aged 16 and 19, at gunpoint after believing they were responsible for the theft.

They then brought them to the house, where they bound and beat and tortured them. They also allegedly threatened their lives and the lives of their relatives.

The group also called the victims' relatives, demanding to know where their stash was and threatening their lives.

The teens, who have not been identified, were released after the men determined they didn't know what happened to the drugs and money, but not before nearly severing one teen's finger with a scissors as they were interrogating him.

Navarro, as well as Ramirez and Alvarez, have been charged in Ramsey County District Court with kidnapping, assault and robbery.

That case was put on hold, pending the outcome of the federal charges.

Villalvazo, who prosecutors say was responsible for injuring the teen's finger, was still at large.
