British troops may have to return to Iraq to fight Islamic fanatics and the UK will have to accept a ‘willingness to take casualties’, Tony Blair warns today.

The former prime minister calls for boots on the ground to take the fight to Islamic State (IS) terrorists who have seized control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

In a 6,500-word essay on his website, Mr Blair acknowledges that there is ‘no appetite’ among the public for sending British troops back to Iraq following his own military forays in the region.

Former prime minister Tony Blair  warned that British troops may have to return to Iraq to fight Islamic fanatics

But he warns it may be the only way to defeat IS fanatics who have murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and are now threatening to kill British taxi driver Alan Henning.

‘Because the enemy we’re fighting is fanatical, because they are prepared both to kill and to die there is no solution that doesn’t involve force applied with a willingness to take casualties in carrying the fight through to the end,’ Mr Blair says.

David Cameron is due to discuss plans for British air strikes with US President Barack Obama in New York tomorrow. But the Prime Minister has all but ruled out committing British troops.

Government sources say the possibility of a recall of Parliament this week has not been ruled out to seek approval for a bombing campaign expected to begin soon.

Ed Miliband signalled yesterday that Labour MPs could back air strikes on Iraq, provided the mission had ‘clear objectives’ and a ‘base in international law’.

Mr Blair welcomes the apparent willingness of regional powers to take the fight to IS, but says Western troops may also be needed, and warns that air strikes will not be enough to defeat the extremists.

‘Air power is a major component of this,’ he says. ‘But – and this is the hard truth – air power alone will not suffice. They can be hemmed in, harried and to a degree contained by air power. But they can’t be defeated by it.

‘If possible, others closer to the field of battle, with a more immediate interest, can be given the weapons and training to carry the fight – and in some cases, that will work. It may work in the case of IS.

‘I accept fully there is no appetite for ground engagement in the West. But we should not rule it out in the future if it is absolutely necessary. Provided that there is the consent of the population directly threatened and with the broadest achievable alliance, we have, on occasions, to play our part. We’re not talking about armies of occupation. We are, in certain situations where it is necessary and subject to all proper limitations, talking about committing ground forces, especially those with special capabilities.’

He warns that the roots of IS go deep into Muslim society, parts of which have an ‘innately hostile’ view of the West, and says the extent of extremist teaching in the UK and elsewhere is ‘much more frightening than you would think’. He adds: ‘The problem is not that we’re facing a fringe of crazy people, a sort of weird cult confined to a few fanatics. If it was, we could probably root it out, kill or imprison its leaders, deter its followers and close the doors to new recruits.

‘The problem is that we’re facing a spectrum of opinion based on a world view which stretches far further into parts of Muslim society.’

Selfless: Alan Henning helps at a refugee camp before he was abducted whilst delivering aid last December

British hostage Alan Henning’s wife has begged Islamic State jihadists to ‘see it in their hearts’ to release him.

Barbara Henning said the 47-year-old taxi driver from Bolton had been delivering aid to Syrian children in an act of ‘sheer compassion’ when he was abducted last December.

‘Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job ... to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need,’ she said in a statement released by the Foreign Office.

‘When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water.

‘I cannot see how it could assist any state’s cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying ... when they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband.’

Her heartfelt plea follows dozens of imams and other Muslim leaders calling for the release of the father of two, described as ‘a man of peace’.

Even radicals such as hate preacher Abu Qatada have spoken out to condemn IS for holding Mr Henning.

But British firebrand Anjem Choudary yesterday said he had no sympathy for the aid worker because, he claimed, ‘in the Koran it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for non-Muslims’.

Mr Henning’s plight was revealed earlier this month at the end of an IS video showing the beheading of fellow British hostage, David Haines.
