Letting your husband teach you how to drive might sound like a recipe for marital disaster but that hasn't stopped three intrepid women from doing exactly that.

Yet despite the potential for pit falls, Rebecca Hornsby, 33, from Hertfordshire, says far from being a disaster, having partner Greg, 31, with her in the car proved something of a blessing.

'When I was younger, I was in a road traffic accident and my boyfriend at the time was killed,' explains the mother-of-three. 'It made me terrified of being on the road.'

A controlling relationship followed, leaving Ms Hornsby lacking in confidence and unwilling to face up to her fears.

All that changed, however, when she met Greg Johnson, a teacher and now the father of their three children, Alfie, nine, Sienna, four, and Bluebell, one.

'Being with Greg has cleared the way for me to do things for myself,' adds his adoring partner, 'and he and the children gave me the confidence to start driving again.'

Not, however, that driving lessons with Greg went entirely to plan. Filmed for Channel 5 documentary, Never Teach Your Wife To Drive, Ms Hornsby's inability to concentrate on the road is enough to leave Greg tearing his hair out.

A lack of spatial awareness and a fondness for the accelerator don't help either, with Greg at one point leaning over to grab the wheel, only for Ms Hornsby to screech: 'You're not allowed to grab my flipping wheel! That must be illegal, Greg!'

But while it might sound, quite literally, like a recipe for car crash TV, Ms Hornsby insists that the overall experience has been a positive one, even if she wasn't too keen on her other half's 'blunt and to-the-point' teaching style.

'We have a very strong relationship, we laugh everyday and always make up if we have a tiff,' she explains.

'If your relationship is strong it shouldn't cause a problem and I enjoyed every minute. We still laugh about the experience now.'

Poor Greg is also nursing some bruises after Ms Hornsby accidentally hit him with the car and, unsurprisingly, asked her to get a real driving instructor for attempt number two.

One lesson she is still to learn is one that Greg spends much of the series trying to pass on - concentrate on the road.

'Greg teaching me to drive only really affected our relationship while we were in the car,' she explains.

Happy ending: Despite the thrills and spills, Rebecca said she would do it all over again given the chance

'Greg was always telling me to take it seriously and concentrate but that was something I found really difficult because I'm a fun-loving person and rarely take anything seriously.'

And, in one heart-stopping moment, it almost had fatal results. 'I put my foot on the wrong pedal and shot across the junction into a petrol station,' she admits.

Another scary moment saw her take out a row of recycling bins - much to the horror of both Greg and the driving examiner in the back.

But, hopes Ms Hornsby, the day when she finally makes it onto the road as a fully-fledged driver isn't far off and since the end of filming, has passed her theory test.

Still having lessons, albeit not with Greg, she says her driving has improved immeasurably although, she jokes, she still rings her friends and family to warn them when she's on the road.

After a litany of near misses, tension-laden drives and driving induced flare-ups, would she recommend other women employ their husbands as driving instructors?

'I'd definitely do it all again,' she chuckles. 'From me, it's a big, fat yes!'
