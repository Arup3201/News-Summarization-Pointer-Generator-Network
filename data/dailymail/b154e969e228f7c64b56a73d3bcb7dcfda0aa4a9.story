A drunk Briton who threatened to kill an air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol is to have his mental health assessed.

The 42-year-old, named only as A M, was eating food off the floor of an Emirates flight from London to Dubai when he started to throw his meal at other passengers and verbally abuse the staff.

Dubai Criminal Court has ordered a medical committee to examine the man after his outburst on the flight in June during which he told a female flight attendant that she was a 'sex slave'.

A British man who threatened to kill an Emirates air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol is to have his mental health assessed

The defendant began drinking shortly before take-off and continued 20 minutes into the journey, the court heard.

Indian flight attendant, 30, known only as B S, said: 'He was eating and throwing away food on the floor, then eating off the floor.

'I went to him and asked him to return to his seat and have his meal there. I then brought a garbage bag and started picking up the food he threw away.

'He also threw food on passengers around him and jumped from his seat to the aisle and started making a mess. Some passengers asked to change seats from near him.'

A Dubai court was told that the threat was made by the 40-year-old, named only as A M, amid several outbursts of verbal abuse directed at cabin staff and unseemly behaviour that included throwing food at other passengers

As she cleaned up after him, B S said the defendant aggressively pulled her shirt.

When she asked him to stop touching her, he got up from his seat and began a torrent of insults.

'He stood up and told me I was trash, a sex slave and a b****,' she said, adding that the Briton also insulted some of her colleagues.

He then threatened to slap B S, kill her and chop her up if she did not give him more alcohol.

Fellow flight attendant, E M, 26, from Egypt said: 'I was ordered to attend to the problem and, when I did, I saw him jumping on his seat and pulling B S from her shirt, then insulting her with very bad words.'

He proceeded to the toilet where he lit a cigarette, setting off the fire alarm and scaring his fellow passengers, the court heard.

The unruly passenger fell asleep shortly before the plane landed in Dubai, and then started to also insult the waiting police, court records showed.

He denied all the charges against him, including one of illegal consumption of alcohol.

The court was due to issue a verdict on Wednesday morning but instead ordered the mental health check.
