They look like they could have come from a futuristic science fiction film, but these vehicles could in fact be the blueprint for the car of tomorrow.

The bizarre-looking cars have been designed and built by student teams from 24 countries as part of the Shell Eco-marathon Europe 2013, which came to a close in Rotterdam today.

The event challenges the students to make the most energy efficient cars, through using conventional fuels such as petrol, diesel, ethanol and GTL fuel, as well as alternatives such as hydrogen and electricity.

Thousands of students from across Europe took part in the Shell Eco-marathon Challenge Europe in Rotterdarm, which finished today. Pictured is PEGGIE, a prototype running on an electric battery, competing for the University of Oxford

The challenge sees students compete to see who can drive the furthest on the equivalent of 1 kWh or 1 litre of fuel

Results are measured on who can drive the furthest on the equivalent of 1 kWh or 1 litre of fuel.

This year's event saw winners from nine countries scooping the prizes, while no less than five new records have been set.

Peter Voser, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, said: 'It's always inspiring to see the leaders and engineers of the future put their bright and creative ideas into action.

'This year's Shell Eco-marathon again showcased new innovations and promising creative technologies.

'We are looking back at a successful event which attracted over 50,000 visitors and 3,000 students from the Netherlands and beyond to support the teams and visit Shell Energy Lab.

'I found it encouraging to see so many people enjoying the attractions around innovation and the future of energy.'

In the UrbanConcept category, team Polytech Nantes from France achieved a new record with 145.7 km per kWh in the battery electric fuel class - an improvement of 41.7 km per kWh from last year; while German team Schluchtspecht from University of Applied Sciences Offenburg improved on a record with 315.4 km/l. 

Polytech Nantes’ team leader said: 'We’ll definitely come back next year to improve this year’s record.'

In the Prototype category, the SCS Pasquet from France smashed the previous record for battery-electric with a result of 1,224.1 km/kWh.

Team Microjoule-La Joliverie once again came out on top in the Prototype petrol category achieving 2,980.3 km/l equivalent, enough to drive from Rotterdam to Athens on a single litre of fuel.

Norman Koch, technical director of Shell Eco-marathon, said: 'The competitiveness at Shell Eco-marathon this year was never higher.

'Many teams showed significant improvements on previous years, leading to closer competition overall and photo finishes in many categories.

'This illustrates how innovation is being put into practice successfully by many more teams.'
