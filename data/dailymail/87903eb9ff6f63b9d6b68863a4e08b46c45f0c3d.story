Christmas trees have become easier to decorate because they have fewer branches at the top - after two consecutive mild winters, growers claimed yesterday.

Many of the popular Nordmann Fir trees grown in England have big gaps between their top branches because they have grown upwards too quickly in the unseasonal weather.

Experts say the perfect Christmas tree should have around 9in to 15in gaps between its branches but two good growing seasons means the branches at the top of this year's trees are very sparse.

Two mild winters: Mr Thurkettle said growers 'need colder winters to create the perfect Christmas tree'

This year's mild weather means the bottoms of the trees are also much more bushy than normal.

Vincent Thurkettle, 58, who grows Norway Spruce, Blue Spruce and Nordmann Firs at Manor Farm in Great Hockham, Norfolk, said growers ‘need colder winters to create the perfect Christmas tree’.

He added: ‘We have had two long mild summers and a mild last winter, which means the trees have grown too fast and the distance between the rings of branches is bigger than usual.

‘Luckily most of our customers are seeing this as a positive because it makes it easier to dress the tree with tinsel and large baubles which hang well in the gaps.’

Choices: Many Christmas tree customers are said to be selecting trees with bigger gaps between branches

Improvements: The milder weather also means the needles on the Christmas tree are better than usual

Colin Palmer, who runs Coddington Christmas Tree Farm near Ledbury in Herefordshire, said it was the taller Nordmann Firs over 6ft which had mainly been effected.

But he added that many of his customers were actually selecting the trees which had bigger gaps between their branches.

Mr Palmer said: ‘My clients have welcomed it as it makes it easier for them to decorate the tree and we've found people have actually been selecting these trees.

‘This year was the best growing season for over a decade so there has been robust growth and it means the top shoots up quickly and the lower part of the tree is even more bushy than usual.’

The milder weather also means the needles on the Christmas tree are better than usual.

Mr Thurkettle added: ‘The foliage is the best I have ever seen. It is beautiful, green and lush and really silky and soft. The needles are as good as they can ever be.’
