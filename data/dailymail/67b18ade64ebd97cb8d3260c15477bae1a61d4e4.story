Four men face multiple charges after two people were injured in Memorial Day shootings on Florida's Clearwater Beach.

Clearwater police spokeswoman Joelle Castelli said the Monday evening shootings arose from fights between groups of people.

The first shots were fired by a group shortly before 7pm in a temporary parking garage near the Hyatt Regency Clearwater Beach Resort and Spa. The other group were in the street.

Another shooting occurred near Pier 60, two blocks away from the Hyatt Hotel. Police refused to disclose the location of the third shooting.

Police said the shootings came after an apparent gang-related argument at the popular beach spot where families were enjoying Memorial Day.

At least two people were shot - one in the hand and the other in the groin area. Police said the person who was shot in the hand fled the area. Neither of the victims were random bystanders.

Haley Tausinger, 17, who works at a local beach restaurant told The Tampa Tribune that a group had gathered before the shootings took place. She said that customers and staff fled into a back room when the gunshots rang out.

Miss Tausinger said: 'Once the shooting started everyone started running and getting down on the ground. I was pretty distraught after it.'
