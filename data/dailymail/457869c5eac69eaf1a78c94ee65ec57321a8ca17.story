The number of guns and amount of alcohol being smuggled into the country through UK airports has risen sharply, new research reveals.

The figures show that in 2013/14, 605 firearms were seized by UK border staff, a rise from the 412 of the previous year and 316 in 2011/12.

And there has been an overall rise in confiscated alcohol in comparison to previous years.  

Sharp rise: The graph shows that more guns have been seized in the past year than in previous years

2013/14 has seen 56.5m litres of beer, wines and spirits confiscated - a dramatic leap from the 46m litres and just over 35m seized in 2011/12 and 2010/11 respectively.

Cigarette figures have drastically reduced, compared to 2010/11's 650m to last year's 318m.

The figures also showed some rather unusual seizures including nine grey francolin birds, 13 San Salvador rock iguanas. 15 kilos of ivory and 400 fake England football shirts.     

The figures were revealed by Essex-based freight company Barrington Freight who filed a Freedom of Information request

The number of illegal substances being brought into the country has doubled, the research revealed

The figures were revealed by Essex-based freight company Barrington Freight who filed a Freedom of Information request. 

Their research also found that desperate smugglers went to the extent of weaving heroin into baskets and stuffing 1.1kg of cannabis into a box of cookies. 

'Border Force plays a key role in the fight to stop the importation and exportation of illegal and restricted goods entering the UK,' said a spokesman told The Telegraph. 

'Our measures are working – we are hitting our targets on seizures of high priority goods including firearms and alcohol. These seizures in turn help to combat the organised crime and corruption that often accompanies the trade in illegal goods.'
