An historic Sydney property belonging to the Anglican Church has now been on the market for more than two years, but with a price tag of over $20 million is yet to sell.

In light of this, Archbishop of Sydney Glenn Davies will move into the heritage-listed mansion, located in Darling Point in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

Bishopscourt has been vacant since Archbishop Peter Jensen retired a year ago, and his replacement did not move in as the house needed renovations and the church had placed it on the market, the Sydney Morning Herald report.

Centuries old property Bishopscourt is on the market for $25 million but has not sold in the past two years

In a vote at the church council Synod in 2012, 452 out of 579 members voted in favour of selling the property in a historic decision. Previously it had been occupied by the current archbishop.

The 6,216-square-metre neo-Gothic estate is on the market for $25 million, and has been owned by the church for more than a century. It was originally listed for a five year period, but that window could be extended.

Chairman of the Anglican Property Trust Dr Robert Tong told the publication: 'Synod authorised a five-year window for the sale because we always knew this might be a lengthy process'.

Renovations on Bishopcourt are set to take place in August and September of this year, and Archbishop Davies is expected to move in before Christmas.

The property went to auction in March but bids did not even meet the $20 million mark. Local buyers have apparently been negotiating prices in recent months.

The Anglican Church said the mansion could be on the property well beyond the date in October 2017 it is currently listed until.

Built from sandstone, some of the mansion's most prominent features include the stained glass windows, and intricately carved doorways.

A porte-coch√®re - a porch like structure - in the form of a Gothic chapel was added in 1860 by architect Edmund Blacket, when the property was still held its original name of Greenoaks.

An actual chapel was constructed in 1935 by Professor L Wilkinson after the house was sold into the hands of the church.

The enormous property spans more than 6216-square-metres
