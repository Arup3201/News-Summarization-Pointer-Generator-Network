A 26-year-old New Jersey dad is facing up to life as a single father - after his girlfriend died giving birth to their second child.

Josh Dempe lost Lauren Weller, 35, last Saturday evening following the birth of their baby girl Chloe by emergency Caesarean section.

Now the local community has rallied around Josh, already raising more than $39,000 online for the father now left to raise a baby and his 4-year-old daughter Lexxi.
