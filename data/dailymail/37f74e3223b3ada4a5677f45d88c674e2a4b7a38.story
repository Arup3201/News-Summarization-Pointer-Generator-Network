A Connecticut teen who was all but imprisoned in a Boston hospital for 16 months finally got the homecoming she deserved Sunday.

At the same time, Justina Pelletier of West Hartford got the Sweet 16 party she couldn't have while forcibly separated from her friends and family.

'She's missed so many holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, Easter and all the religious holidays,' Justina's father Lou Pelletier told FoxCT.

Justina, who first checked in to Boston Children's Hospital in February 2013 with flu-like symptoms, was feeling better then she had in quite some time as 100 of her closest loved ones celebrated her return home. 

Home at last: Justina Pelletier was surrounded by friends and family in New Haven on Sunday as she celebrated her sweet 16 and homecoming after she was forcibly kept in a hospital for 16 months

Saga: Justina posed for photos with family and friends at an event some of them feared would never come after the teen was diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and her parents accused of abusing her

'I'm a princess': Justina's party was attended by 100 of her loved ones and featured a raffle and an auction

'They've treated me so well. I feel like I'm a princess with a tiara,' said a beaming Justina. 

Even State Senator Markley, who worked with Connecticut and Massachusetts authorities to get Justina home was in attendance at the event, which included an auciton, a raffle and numerous tributes to Justina.

The party was dubbed 'Sparkling Homecoming Party' because 'no one can ever dull Justina's sparkle.'

'She's so happy to have people here that have been fighting for, friends, family, people she's never met before,' said Lou Pelletier.

Her parents say they hope will soon start school.

Nowhere to turn: Lou and Linda Pelletier were accused of abusing their daughter after doctors different from her normal physician diagnosed her with a psychiatric disorder instead of with a physical one, as she'd been before

Suffering: Justina is now believed to suffer from mitochondrial disease. Her parents were allowed very little contact with them as she suffered in a Massachusetts hospital miles from her Connecticut home

'It might take a long time, but I know I have a lot of people cheering me on,' she said.

Justina's disease is hard to diagnose and, according to the Mito Action support group, parents have been suspected of child abuse and sufferers accused of somatization disorders or fabricating pain.

Meanwhile, Somatoform Disorder is considered to be anxiety-related with sufferers feeling real pain that cannot be medically explained. Between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and 0.2 per cent of men in the U.S. have been diagnosed as sufferers.

Justina's family insisted she did not have Somatoform Disorder symptoms when she was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital.

Justina couldn't see her family without a welfare supervisor or hospital staff member in the room.

She was rarely allowed outside for fresh air and spends most of her time in a small room, off the main psychiatric ward, without even a television to occupy her time.

She was finally reunited with her family in June.

Still battling: A long road to recovery paved with physical therapy and more potential illnesses lay ahead for Justina

Justina was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease several years ago, a genetic condition that affects muscle coordination and mobility.

The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy.

There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death.

Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances.

Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the United states are born with a mitochondrial disease.

After being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February however doctors concluded the teenager was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a psychological condition that causes

sufferers to feel pain, although there is no physical cause for it.

Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain.

Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants.

Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms.

Experts estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition.
