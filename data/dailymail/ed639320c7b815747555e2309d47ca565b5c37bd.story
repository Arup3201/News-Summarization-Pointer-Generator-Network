An investigation into public Wi-Fi networks has found 51 per cent of free hotspots in the UK let users access adult and explicit content. 

The research, carried out by mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile, tested the web filters on public networks across the country and discovered one in three UK cafes and restaurants have no filtering in place at all - leaving children in danger of accessing pornography.

A further 20 per cent of food establishment similarly failed to stop customers from visiting sex dating sites such as AdultFriendFinder.com.

An investigation by mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile into public Wi-Fi networks has found 51 per cent of free hotspots in the UK let users access adult and explicit content. The research also discovered one in three UK cafes and restaurants have no filtering in place at all, leaving children in danger or accessing pornography

Technology magazine PC Pro recently tested 15 of the most popular web filters used in homes and discovered only three blocked 100 per cent of porn. 

The investigations included free and paid-for services.

It also tested each filter using pro-anorexia, pro-suicide, gore and gambling sites, as well as sites classed as containing 'hate' or 'tasteless humour'.

More than 150 sites were used, yet not a single package blocked every instance of explicit, adult or inappropriate content.

Norton Family was the best performing filter, while MetaCert was the worst.

Mystery shoppers in London, Manchester and Birmingham attempted to access inappropriate content including pornography, drug- and violence-related sites.

The investigation found over half (53 per cent) of cafes and restaurants do not have any restrictions in place to block online stores selling knives and swords.

While four out of five (80 per cent) also granted full access to drug-related content such as ILoveCocaine.com.

'For every parent across the UK this report will come as an unwelcome surprise,' said Graeme Coffey, vice president product strategy and business development at AdaptiveMobile.

'In the last two years there have been two convergent trends: a big increase in public Wi-Fi and greater access to smartphones, gaming consoles and tablets with a Wi-Fi capability, the kind of device a child could have.

'Most people will instinctively block adult content when it comes to filtering, but what these results show is that we should also be looking at content related to drugs and violence which are just as harmful but frequently overlooked.'

The report examined web filters across cafes, restaurants, hotels, retailers and public spaces. Hotels scored the worst with 74 per cent not blocking pornography. Government-owned public spaces such as train stations had the strongest filters with more than 90 per cent of them restricting access to pornography

The report examined web filters across cafes, restaurants, hotels, retailers and public spaces.

Hotels scored the worst out of the five categories, with three out of four (74 per cent) not blocking pornography and only one in ten actively blocking online weapons shops.

During a similar investigation in the U.S, researchers found 72 per cent of American cafes and restaurants have no restrictions on access to pornography - more than double the UK.

'Having filters in public spaces is just as important as other restrictions such as the smoking ban and modesty covers on adult magazines,' says Andy Phippen, Professor of Social Responsibility in IT, Plymouth Business School.

'The fact that this protection isn't available in a significant proportion of publicly accessible sites will undoubtedly cause concern.

'However, we should also reflect on 
the effectiveness of some of those in place - simply having a filter 
doesn't necessarily mean everything is protected.

'These
results should encourage public outlets across the UK to review the 
Wi-Fi services that they have in place and ensure that they are fit for 
purpose and appropriate for their customers.'

Government-owned property and public spaces, such as train stations, had the strongest filters.

More
than 90 per cent of government sites restricted access to pornography, 
although one in three granted full access to online weapons stores.

Research was carried out during September 2013 across 179 locations in Birmingham, Manchester and London in the UK and 86 locations in Boston, New York and San Francisco in the U.S.

Research staff visited cafes, restaurants, retail outlets, hotels and public spaces and attempted to log onto various websites.

These sites include Pornhub.com (Pornography), Adultfriendfinder.com (Adult dating), Budk.com (Knife purchases) and Ilovecocaine.com (Drugs).

Each website was scored using an 'accessibility matrix' created in partnership with Andy Phippen, Professor at the University of Plymouth.

It recorded any measures that prevented staff from logging onto websites, including the need for personal details, credit card numbers or branded warnings from the cafe, hotel and so on.

All research staff were over 18 at the time of the research and consented to be part of the project.

Similarly, Sky-owned The Cloud automatically filters adult content at hotspots in public places.

The Cloud is used in more than 20,000 hotspots, including Greggs, PizzaExpress, JD Wetherspoon and Caffe Nero and applies the filter by default.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'We believe that parents want peace of mind that their children cannot inadvertently access adult material when out of home. 

'That’s why we were the first WiFi provider to apply content filters as default across our entire network.'

Coffey added: 'Cafes, restaurants, hotels and administrators of public spaces should talk to their ISP and other bodies to understand the most appropriate filtering methods for their premises.'

'Whilst hotels are predominantly private places, where a ‘no filtering’ policy may be appropriate, hotel lobbies, cafes and restaurants are more public and the content policy should reflect this.

'It is certainly neither a simple nor a ‘one size fits all’ matter, and the community should work together to understand the issues and put a suitable policy in place.'
