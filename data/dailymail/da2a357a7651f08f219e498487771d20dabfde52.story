A 36-year-old grandmother has been arrested after her 10-month-old granddaughter was found to have ingested methamphetamine in Arkansas on Tuesday.

Marsha Ann Stevens put her granddaughter to bed at 9pm on Tuesday night but heard the baby screaming 10 minutes later.

The baby's 20-year-old mother Courtney Stevens was also in the house and called 911 when the child began vomiting.

The baby was taken by ambulance to the St Bernard's Medical Center in Jonesboro, Arkansas but when her condition worsened she was airlifted to the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.

According to the incident report, hospital staff said the baby's eyes were open wide and she 'could not stay still and was moving constantly and appeared to be very scared.'

When doctors discovered methamphetamine in the baby's system the police were notified.

Officers ran both the Stevens women's names through dispatch and discovered Marsha Stevens had previous arrests for possession of methamphetamine and was already on probation.

Stevens senior was arrested at her home on the 400 block of Slate St for introducing a controlled substance to another's body, possession of drug paraphernalia and endangering the welfare of a minor. She was taken to the Craighead County Detention Center.

Courtney Stevens admitted to police that she knew her mother took methamphetamine but said that she herself was clean.

In a doorstep interview with a WREH reporter, she said, 'They’re trying to make it like my baby swallowed a whole bag of dope, but no.' 

Police say that Courtney Stevens told them her mother handed her a plastic sachet of methamphetamine that was 'wet and appeared to have been chewed on,' when the ambulance arrived at their home.

She was cited for endangering the welfare of a minor because she knew about her mother's drug use and allowed her to be in an 'unsafe environment'.

Two others were arrested at the Stevens home for unrelated offenses.

The baby is still at the Children's Hospital but her condition is improving. According to Breitbar, Courtney Stevens' daughter will not be returned to her care.

Courtney Stevens said in a written statement to local reporters: 'I cant have my baby back on the simple fact that my momma has a drug history and leaving my baby with my momma while I was going to a job interview was my fault. Their [sic] taking my baby because of that.'

On Tuesday Courtney Stevens' Facebook profile picture was changed to a picture of herself and her daughter. It is unclear when or if she will be allowed to have the child back.
