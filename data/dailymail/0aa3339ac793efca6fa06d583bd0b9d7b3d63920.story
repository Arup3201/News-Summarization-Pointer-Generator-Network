When most of us think of dog photography, it's likely images of cute puppies play fighting or snoozing in funny positions come to mind.

But one photographer set himself the challenge of capturing canines at their loneliest and most vulnerable - resulting in this series of strangely poignant images.

Photographer Martin Usborne spent two years creating a unique collection of images of dogs left alone in cars entitled The Silence Of Dogs In Cars.

The series shows the animals peering out of the misted windows of their owners cars, looking sad, lonely and dejected or sometimes alert and expectant.

Usborne, who lives in East London with his fiancé and their two dogs, came up with the idea for the series after remembering how he once felt being left alone in a car as a small child.

While the experience may have only lasted a few minutes, Usborne recalls how, as a child, it felt as though he may be left there alone forever.

He said: 'I was once left in a car at a young age. 'I don’t know when or where or for how long. Possibly it was at the age of four. Perhaps it was outside Tesco’s. Probably for fifteen minutes only. The details don’t matter.

'The point is that I wondered if anyone would come back: in a child’s mind it is possible to be alone forever.'

This brief experience stuck in Usborne's mind and gave him a 'deep affinity' to animal suffering.

But the photographer makes it clear that none of the dogs captured in his series were harmed in any way.

All of the scenarios captured were merticulously planned and set up in a studio. He recruited subjects by approaching dog owners while walking his own dogs. The cars used were then picked to 'match' the dogs.

He said: 'Although bewildered at first, it was incredible to see how many strangers were so eager to help out and let their dog be photographed.

'After the dog was found, I tried to match the dog to the car. People aren't as bothered about seeing their car in a book as they are their dog.'

Each session took him hundred of images and up to four hours to capture a soulful moment.

Usborne, who studied psychology at Edinburgh University and then animation at Glasgow School of Art, said: 'The camera is the perfect tool for capturing a sense of silence and longing.

'Two layers of glass are placed between the viewer and the viewed - the glass of the lens, the glass of the picture frame and, in this instance, the glass of the car window further isolates the animal. The dog is truly trapped.

'When I finally took the first picture, I began to understand where it all came from - fears of being alone, unheard, fears of being like an animal with no human voice.

'The images in this series explore that feeling, both in relation to myself and to animals in general.'

Usborne revealed he has suffered from depression in the past and the fear of loneliness is something he is familiar with.

He said: 'I’ve suffered from depression on and and off for much of my life and I’ll place a fair bet that these fears are at the heart of my struggles. 'But strangely enough I found peering into those cars and seeing the dogs inside somewhat beautiful – as if I was looking into the darkest places inside myself and seeing a face there.

'When I started this project I knew the photos would be dark. What I didn’t expect was to see so many subtle reactions by the dogs - some sad, some expectant, some angry, some dejected.'

Usborne started his photographic career after a number of years working as a creative director in children’s TV.

He was also the recipient of the 2009 Taylor Wessing Award in the National Portrait Gallery for his photograph 'Tiger, Rag, Johnny and Emma'.

Usborne’s new book of the picture series entitled The Silence Of Dogs In Cars, published by Kehrer Verlag, has already been released in Europe and rewarded ‘Best in Show’ in the Creative Review Photography Annual 2012.

The first edition of the book sold out in six weeks and is now going to be released in America in early April.

The collection will also be going on show at the Little Black Gallery in London this spring from 19 March to 27 April.
