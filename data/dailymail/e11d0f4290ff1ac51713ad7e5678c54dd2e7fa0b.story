Truly shocking: David Blaine plans to have a one million-volt charge surge through his body nonstop for 72 hours

His latest death defying stunt, called Electrified: One Million Volts Always On, will take place in New York next week.

In a YouTube trailer for the stunt, Blaine stands on a metal pedestal wearing a futuristic mesh suit and a globe-shaped wire helmet as electrical bolts hit him from all directions.

Blaine said he will stand between two electrodes and allow a million volts to flow through his grounded body.

Any disruption in the stream could stop his heart.

The event will be streamed live over the internet.

Blaine, 39, is known for his endurance
stunts, including sitting in a glass box over the River Thames in 
London for over a month.

His last stunt was hanging upside down without a net high over New York's Central Park for 60 hours in 2008.

His
other stunts include being entombed in an underground plastic box 
underneath a 3-ton water-filled tank in 1999, being encased in a block 
of ice for 63 hours in 2000.
