A size 12 woman who gained seven stone because her boyfriend convinced her 'bigger is better' was mortified when she discovered he was cheating on her with eight 'skinny minnies'.

Cassie Payne, from north London, increased to a size 24 in four years after meeting her ex because he told her he thought curves were more attractive.

The 5ft 4ins 26-year-old was devastated when she discovered he'd been cheating on her with at least eight other women - and none of them were overweight.

Cassie said: 'I was shocked that he had been unfaithful but the biggest smack in the face was the fact that all the other women were thin.

'I expected them all to be big girls like me because I thought that was his type. When I saw they were all really slim it didn't make sense.

'When he admitted they were his type and that he'd gone off big girls I was mortified. I'd got so fat because I thought he preferred it when all the time he was going behind my back with thin girls.'

Cassie weighed 10st 7lbs when she first met her ex - who we cannot name - through friends.

'I thought he adored my curvy body': Cassie was 17st at her heaviest but her boyfriend told her not to worry about her weight

The couple would enjoy having nights in together eating takeaways four times a week. As Cassie's waistline began to expand, she expressed concern over their unhealthy diet but he would tell her not to worry about her size.

She said: 'My mum gently suggested I
should lose some weight but when I told my boyfriend he assured me I 
looked great and not to worry.

'He was always saying that celebrities had got it so wrong because men hated really skinny girls and loved real curves. When I put on weight he told me I looked sexier so I got the impression that it was the bigger the better.'

'I
had spent the past four years eating everything thinking that he adored
my curvy body when all the time he was slowly going off me'

After they had been together four years, she had ballooned to a size 24 and 17st.

'I knew I was obese but told myself that as long as my partner fancied me, what did it matter? We were happy so I didn't need to worry what other people thought,' Cassie said.

But then her happiness was shattered when she got a call from a friend warning her that her man was cheating.

'I confronted him and he told me it was utter rubbish. I believed him and told my friend not to call me again,' she said.

But as time passed Cassie began to grow suspicious.

She said: 'He was going out on his own and started switching his phone off. I noticed he said his battery was dead quite a lot which seemed odd.'

After he started receiving texts in the middle of the night, Cassie decided to check his phone.

'I decided to do a bit of snooping to put my mind at rest and logged onto his Facebook page. I scrolled through the timeline and there was a photo of my boyfriend which had been tagged 'my baby' by a woman I didn't know. I posted a comment saying "Who's baby?"

Minutes later she received a private message from the woman asking Cassie how she knew him.

When Cassie replied that he was her long-term boyfriend, she was shocked when the woman replied saying she was his girlfriend too.

At first she didn't want to believe it: 'I convinced myself she was lying and just jealous because she fancied him.'

'I was angry with him, but I was angry with myself too. I had left myself go and I vowed to lose the weight'

But then she found eight Facebook messages from different women all claiming to be dating her boyfriend.

She confronted her man and was appalled when he admitted he had been cheating.

But she was even more shocked when she looked at the profile pictures of the women he had seen behind her back.

'I wanted to know why he had cheated. I expected them all to be big girls like me because that was his thing. But they were all skinny minnies. It didn't make sense,' she said. 

When she asked him why, he told her he 'used to like big girls but now preferred skinny women.'

'He might as well have slapped me in the face, I was gutted,' Cassie recalled. 'I had spent the past four years eating everything thinking that he adored my curvy body when all the time he was slowly going off me.

Moved on: Cassie was 10st 7lb, left, when she met her ex before gaining weight. Now she's slimmest she has ever been, right, and wasn't interested when her ex wanted her back

'I was angry with him, but I was angry with myself too. I had left myself go and I vowed to lose the weight.'

Cassie joined a gym and overhauled her diet.

She said: 'Before I'd have a sausage and egg sandwich for breakfast followed by stacks of biscuits and a carton of fruit juice mid-morning before tucking into a jacket potato piled with cheese and coleslaw for lunch. Then a takeaway with bread and butter for dinner, as well as chocolate bars and packets of crisps as I watched TV in the evening.

'Instead I ate fruit for breakfast, a salad for lunch and chicken and vegetables for dinner. Snacks were out and I only drank water.'

Using revenge against her ex as her 
motivation, she stuck with her diet and exercise regime and the weight 
began to fall off until she was a slim size 8, weighing nine stone.

'My confidence started to grow. I noticed other men seemed interested in me and stopped thinking about my ex so much,' she said.

Confident: Cassie is now a size 8 after cutting out junk food and joining a gym

BEFORE, WEIGHT 17st:

Breakfast: Sausage and egg sandwich

Lunch: Jacket potato piled with cheese and coleslaw

Dinner: Takeaway with bread and butter followed by chocolate bars and packets of crisps

Snacks: Stacks of biscuits and a carton of fruit juice

AFTER, WEIGHT 9st

Breakfast: Fruit

Lunch: Salad

Dinner: Chicken and vegetables

Snacks: None, drank water

But then she bumped into him at a party and had the chance to show him what he was missing. 

'He was staring at me and I noticed he was looking me up and down. But it wasn't until our eyes met that he looked shocked and it twigged it was me.'

'He walked over and I laughed and said to him "you didn't recognize me did you?" He admitted he hadn't and told me I looked amazing.

'He asked me if I fancied going out some time. Once I would have done anything to hear those words but I suddenly realised I just didn't care anymore.

'I said "no thanks" and walked away. Knowing his eyes were on my size eight bum as I walked off was the best feeling in the world. I haven’t seen him since and have no desire to.

'But if he does read this I would like to thank him for cheating on me. It was the best thing he ever did for me because I have honestly never been happier.'
