Arsenal remain interested in Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho.

Sporting are ready to cash in on the 22-year-old, who has been a target of Manchester United in the past, but Arsene Wenger is reluctant to pay his £37m buy-out clause. 

The Portuguese media reported on Monday that the Gunners were ready to splash the cash again this summer but only want to pay £24m.

The Portugal international represented his country at the World Cup this summer and appears to be the perfect fit for Wenger as he seeks a new defensive midfielder.

Last month, Sporting director Augusto Ignacio said: 'It’s not like the old days when players left Sporting at any price.

'The termination clause ensures a great deal for Sporting. I am very pleased with the negotiations.'

Athletic Bilbao, meanwhile, are persevering with their interest in Arsenal's Mikel Arteta and Nacho Monreal.

Arteta has made it clear he wants to stick it out at Arsenal but Monreal may consider what is on offer back in Spain.

Both Spaniards featured in the team which were beaten 1-0 by Monaco in the Emirates Cup on Sunday with Artera captaining the side.

Real Madrid say they have yet to receive a bid for Sami Khedira but won't let him leave for free next summer.

The German is due to return to training at Madrid on Wednesday and will hold talks over his future.

Meanwhile, MK Dons have taken England U21 international striker Benik Afobe on a season-long loan from Arsenal.
