A six-year-old boy who died last 
summer after falling from the grand staircase at his father's luxurious 
mansion was likely assaulted before plunging to his death, a new medical 
report claimed.

Max Shacknai's death was the first in a 
bizarre series of events that led to his father's girlfriend being found
hanged, bound and naked, from a balcony at the palatial home in 
San Diego two days later.

Police declared both deaths solved 
and that pharmaceutical millionaire Jonah Shacknai was not involved in 
either.

Tragedy: Max Shacknai's death was the first in a bizarre series of events that led to his father's girlfriend being found hanged, bound and naked, from a balcony at the palatial home in San Diego two days later

Max Shacknai was in the care of his father's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau at the time of his death.

Max's death was ruled an accident and Miss Zahau's death deemed a suicide.

Max's mother Dinah Shacknai - who divorced from Max's father in 2010 - refused to believe these findings and instead hired her own team of investigators.

The new report claimed that Max was the victim of a homicide.

Jonah and Dinah Shacknai were said to have had a tumultuous and sometimes violent relationship and they repeatedly accused each other of verbal and physical abuse in the short time they were married.

Police had to be called to the 27-room mansion on three different occasions.

Ms Shacknai called on the Coronado police to reopen the case after the findings from Dr Judy Melinek, a San Francisco-based 
forensic pathologist, and Dr Robert Bove, an injury biomechanics 
expert.

She told Fox News: 'I can't imagine anyone in the world wanting to harm Maxie. He was the most sweet, loving and gentle boy.' 

In the new report, both medical experts said that Max had injuries consistent with being beaten.

Dr Melinek reported that the child had injuries on his body which could not just have come from a fall, adding that it was impossible for Max to have bumped into the balcony and fallen over.

The claims appeared to point the finger at Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend Rebecca which the late woman's sister strongly denied today.

Mystery: Max Shacknai's multimillionaire father, Jonah Shacknai, was not home at the time, but Mr Shacknai's girlfriend, Miss Zahau, 32, was along with her 13-year-old sister

Mary Zahau told RadarOnline: 'The thought that Rebecca would cause Max harm is preposterous.'

Mary added that the relationship between her sister and Max was a close and loving one, with her treating him like her own child.

The Coronado police department said it would review the report and decide whether to reopen the investigation.

Max died at the hospital shortly after he tumbled down the grand staircase at the historic Spreckels manor.

His multimillionaire father, Jonah Shacknai, was not home at the time, but Mr Shacknai's girlfriend, Miss Zahau, 32, was along with her 13-year-old sister.

Jonah Shacknai founded pharmaceutical giant Medicis and has been chairman and chief executive since 1988.

The company makes dermatological and aesthetic pharmaceutical products and took $700million in revenue last year.

Shacknai
has two other children from a previous marriage to Kimberly James, a 
pharmaceuticals sales representative for rival firm Johnson & 
Johnson.

The couple married in April 1993 in Bel Air, California, before filing for divorce in 1999.

She later told a psychologist that on their honeymoon he asked her if she thought the marriage was a mistake.

Family
Court records show the couple reached a joint-custody agreement in 2001
for two children: a 14-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy.

Shacknai later married Dina Romano,Max's mother, and the couple divorced in 2008.

Miss Zahau, from Myanmar, had been dating 
the multimillionaire for two years and friends said he had been planning
on proposing to her.

Miss Nalepa began working as an ophthalmic technician in April 2008, but left in December 2010 to devote more time to Mr Shacknai and his three children.

Two days after Max's death on July 16, Mr Shacknai discovered Miss Zahau hanging dead from an outside balcony.

She was naked, gagged and her hands and feet bound.

Miss Zahau's parents also believe that their daughter was murdered.

They hired a private pathologist to conduct a second autopsy. That expert said his findings cast doubt on the suicide ruling.

However, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said the second look revealed no new information and the case remains closed.

Her sister said she spoke with her sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she planned to take her life.

She said she planned to bring Mr Shacknai breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the hospital where his son was being treated.

Dr Cyril Wecht, a private consultant in high-profile investigations ranging from the Kennedy assassination to the death of Anna Nicole Smith, made a nationally televised appearance today on the Dr Phil show to render his opinion about the bizarre death of Rebecca Zahau.

Dr Wecht performed a second, independent autopsy on Miss Zahau's body last month at the request of relatives who have challenged the official determination of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and coroner that she took her own life.

He agreed with the official autopsy finding that the cause of Miss Zahau's death was asphyxiation by hanging, but said he strongly doubted she killed herself.

'While I am not prepared to unequivocally, with absolute scientific certainty, say that it was a homicide and that it was not a suicide, I lean very strongly toward it being a homicide, something involving foul play. And I lean very strongly against it being a suicide,' he said.

Dr Wecht said he was particularly troubled by findings in both autopsies that Miss Zahau had suffered blows to the top of her head, indicated by four separate hemorrhages beneath the scalp.

He said such an injury pointed to the possibility that she was knocked unconscious with a blunt object and could explain why police said there was no sign of a struggle at the scene.

Dr Wecht said he was also puzzled as to why Miss Zahau's neck was not broken by the force of her fall from the balcony. He said the way in which Miss Zahau would have had to tie herself up was possible, but implausible.
