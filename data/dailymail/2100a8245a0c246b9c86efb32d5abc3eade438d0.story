An adorable dog that was rescued after suffering horrific injuries and thrown onto a Brooklyn street is on the road to recovery thanks to New York City school children who helped raise money to pay for medical bills.

The young pit bull puppy named Misty was found with serious injuries all over her body and was rescued from a city shelter several weeks ago.

Students from an Upper West Side school began following the dogs progress after Second Chance Rescue began to treat Misty's wounds and a Facebook page was created.

Dog's life: Every dog has it's day and today it was the turn of Misty to meet local schoolkids who helped make her as good as new after suffering horrendous injuries

Misty's Journey: Funds to help Misty recover were raised through her very own Facebook page

All better: You'd be hard pressed to realise the troubled life Misty has led from these cute pictures, but she very nearly didn't make it

It's believed the horrific injuries were sustained when the pitbull was used as a bait dog for dog fighting. When she was no longer needed, the puppy who was around 6 to 9 months old was left to die on a Brooklyn street corner.

The school set up bake sales and raised more than $800 to help pay for the dog's care.

Dr. Kim Spanjol, a school counselor who works with the students on humane-education programs said the students were inspired to help Misty.

'We do donate to a lot of dogs, but Misty was the victim of dog fighting which is a big problem in our city, around the country and around the world.'

Horrific: Misty was used as a bait dog to train fight dogs. She was left for dead on the streets of Brooklyn

Charity: New York organization Second Chance Rescue pulled the badly wounded Misty from an overcrowded city shelter to give her one-to-one treatment

Second chance: Misty wouldn't have stood a chance had it not been for the work of New York City's dog rescue shelters

Misty visited the school so students could meet the dog they'd been helping in person.

'There aren’t any bad dogs, there are bad owners,' Spanjol said. 'And that’s a message that the kids feel really strongly about – that pit bulls are often victimized because of that image and it’s really, really shameful and the kids want to do everything they can to show people that pit bulls are also sweet and loving dogs and Misty is a perfect example of that.'

The students have formed a group called the Youth Animal Protectors Club.

Jackie O’Sullivan of Second Chance Rescue is hoping Misty’s story inspires kids and adults.

'Her suffering should not be in vain,' O’Sullivan said. 'Her story should raise awareness of dog-fighting in the city.

Misty is doing much better and is now ready for adoption. If you’d like to adopt or more information, visit nycsecondchancerescue.org.
