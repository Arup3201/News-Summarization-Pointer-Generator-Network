'To boldly (not) go': William Shatner as USS 
Enterprise captain James Tiberius Kirk, who explored space in the
 original series of Star Trek

As Captain James T Kirk he was ready to boldly go where no man has gone before.

But it's been claimed that William Shatner turned down the chance to travel into space aboard Virgin Galactic's Spaceship Two because he's scared of flying.

Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson said he offered the original Star Trek star the opportunity to be among the first extraterrestrial tourists because of his links with space.

But the billionaire said the 82-year-old Canadian actor turned down the offer because he's scared to take to the skies.

'He actually said he's frightened of airline travel - which is slightly disillusioning. Captain Kirk is scared of flying,' the Sun quoted Sir Richard as saying.

But Shatner, who played the all-action, alien-romancing captain of the starship Enterprise in 79 episodes of the original Sixties series and seven subsequent Star Trek films, has a slightly different story.

After he was given an honorary doctorate of Letters at his alma mater, Montreal’s McGill University, in 2011, he told reporters that Sir Richard had expected him to foot the £125,000 ($200,000) bill.

'I said, "Well, that’s not much, how much do you guarantee to come back?" And he didn’t have a price on that,' quipped Shatner.

'He wanted me to go up and pay for it and I said: "Hey, you pay me and I’ll go up. I’ll risk my life for a large sum of money." But he didn’t pick me up on my offer.'

That wasn't the first time he had indicated his reluctance to be blasted into the unknown.

Five
 years earlier Shatner said: 'I'm interested in man's march into the 
unknown but to vomit in space is not my idea of a good time.

'Neither is a fiery crash with the vomit hovering over me.'

According to Sir Richard, 63, rockers Muse are the latest big names to enquire about joining him on his pioneering flight.

But he added that they too would have to find the cash for their fares.

'We
 have a policy that however famous people are they won't get upgrades or
 freebies,' he said, adding that he thought Muse would be able to afford
 tickets.

The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo: The 
spacecraft, also known as the VSS Enterprise in homage to Star Trek, 
earlier this month carried out its second powered test flight. the first
 commercial flights are planned for 2014

Virgin Galactic earlier this month carried out its second powered test flight of its spaceship VSS Enterprise, breaking the sound barrier and climbing higher than ever before.

Its manned spacecraft has become the highest commercial winged vehicle to ever fly and it flexed its shuttlecock-inspired 'feather system' for the first time, which is used for safely re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

The flight took place over the Mojave desert and was piloted by Mark Stucky and Clint Nichols and lasted approximately an hour.

The company says it is preparing to launch its first spaceflights next year and claims to have sold 700 tickets so far.
