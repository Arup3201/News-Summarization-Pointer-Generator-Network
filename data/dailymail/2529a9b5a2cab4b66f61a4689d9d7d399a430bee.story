Batman's ride is up for sale -- just the thing for cruising on those Dark Knights.

The original Batmobile from the 1960s TV series will be auctioned on January 19 at the Barrett-Jackson auction house in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Since the show ended in 1968, the Batmobile has been on display at Barris Kustom Industries on Riverside Drive in a gallery.

The car could sell for millions, said Craig Jackson, chief executive of the auction firm.

The 19-foot-long midnight black, bubble-topped car was used in the TV show that starred Adam West as the Caped Crusader.

The car's owner, famed auto customizer George Barris of Los Angeles, transformed the one-of-a-kind 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car into a sleek crime-fighting machine.

On the show, the Batmobile boasted lasers and a Batphone and could lay down smoke screens and oil slicks.

But the real-life car is not actually designed to do any of that.

‘It's difficult to part with,’ Barris told the Los Angeles Times. ‘Whoever the lucky buyer is, I hope they have as much fun with it as I did.’

The Arizona auction house won't say exactly how much it hopes to get for the Batmobile.

Other iconic TV and movie cars have gone for very steep prices, CNN Money reports.

A highly modified 1964 Aston Martin DB5 used in James Bond films sold for $4.6 million in 2010.
