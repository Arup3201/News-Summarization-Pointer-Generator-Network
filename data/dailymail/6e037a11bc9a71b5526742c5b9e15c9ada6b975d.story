Per Mertesacker thought Arsenal supporters were screaming abuse at him when he first joined the club, but now realises his terrace chant is endearing.

The central defender joined the club two years ago and was almost immediately met with 'Big f****** German' from the stands at the Emirates Stadium.

And although he is well aware of what fans are signing now, it wasn't always that clear-cut.

Don't be afraid! Per Mertesacker admitted to being frightened of Arsenal fans' chant about him

That's better! The Germany international was eventually told the real meaning behind the terrace song

'I didnâ€™t really know what they were singing at first,' he told the Daily Star.

'I was frightened at the start because of the F-word.

'My first impression on that was not good. But I finally got it. A German journalist told me they quite like me. They have always tried to get on with me.'

Mertesacker has been in bullish mood this week ahead of Saturday's FA Cup final against Hull City.

The 29-year-old is insistent that Arsene Wenger's side won't bottle it this time around as they attempt to end a nine-year trophy drought at Wembley.
