Horrific: Susann Stacy posted this photo of herself to Facebook after her husband beat her

A Kentucky woman posted a graphic, bloody selfie on Facebook and begged for help online after her husband brutally pistol whipped her and tore the phone out of the wall so she couldn't call 911.

Susann Stacy told police in Leslie County, Kentucky, that she had no option but to plead for help from her Facebook friends.

She had no cell phone service and no working home phone - but she did have a WIFI internet connection. 

One of her friends who saw the post called the sheriff's department. 

'She had several lacerations to the head. They appeared to be bad but we really couldn't tell at the time, due to her hair was matted to her, and the blood,' Leslie County Sheriff's Deputy Sam Mullins told WKYT-TV.

By the time deputies got to Mrs Stacy's house, her husband, Donnie Stacy was gone.

They found the handgun he used to beat his wife under a tire swing that the couple's son plays on.

They tracked Donnie Stacy down nearby and arrested him.

Mrs Stacy says her husband savagely attacked her after he heard her talking on the phone to another man.

Deputies say her Facebook post may have saved her life.

They said it made sense to turn to social media to get in touch with police when her phones stopped working.

It's becoming an increasingly common practice, Deputy Mullins told WKYT.

Mrs Stacy's Facebook page contains plenty of selfies more like these. Earlier this week she posted a horrifying picture of herself bloody and beaten
