Solo, a Team USA soccer star, was also in the car and was nearly arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop, according to TMZ.

A police source told TMZ that the couple were 'a major pain' during the incident.  

The pair reportedly told cops 'Don't you know who we are?' before Stevens was cuffed and carted away.

On Monday afternoon, Solo was spotted stepping into her Los Angeles hotel after a workout, but refused to comment on her husband's arrest, according to TMZ.  

Stevens played nine seasons in the NFL as a tight end, including a Super Bowl appearance with the Seattle Seahawks, before he retired in 2010.

The arrest came less than a week after domestic violence charges against 33-year-old Solo were dismissed after she was arrested for assaulting her nephew and her sister during an allegedly drunken brawl. 

During her court appearances, Stevens showed up to support his wife. 

Solo, the two-time gold medal-winning goalkeeper for the US Women's National Team, is one of the most famous female athletes in the country.

She and Stevens have been together since August 2012. In November 2012, he was arrested after allegedly beating Solo, but a judge ruled there was not enough evidence to hold him.

Hope Solo, pictured in a Washington state court in November, had just been cleared of charged she allegedly battered her sister and nephew during a drunken family brawl. She was accompanied to court by her husband of two years, Jerramy Stevens 

The couple married the day after his release. 

When Stevens was a football player at the University of Washington, he was arrested after he was accused of drugging and raping a 19-year-old student at a fraternity party. 

The prosecutor declined to press charges, but he and the fraternity were later forced to pay out $300,000 as to settle a civil suit brought by the alleged victim.
