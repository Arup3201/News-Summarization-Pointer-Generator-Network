Stephan El Shaarawy helped himself to two goals as Real Madrid were comprehensively beaten by AC Milan in a mid-season friendly in Dubai on Tuesday evening.

Carlo Ancelotti's side entered the winter break on the back of a record 22 consecutive wins but Cristiano Ronaldo and Co were second best to a Milan side currently occupying seventh place in Serie A.

Jeremy Menez opened the scoring for Pippo Inzaghi's side before El Shaarawy doubled Milan's lead after half an hour. Ronaldo pulled a goal back for Real before half time but El Shaarway netted his second of the game just minutes after the restart.

Giampaolo Pazzini and M'Baye Niang combined with the former heading home the latter's cross with under 20 minutes to play before Karim Benzema scored from the penalty spot in the closing stages as Los Blancos tasted defeat for the first time since September, albeit in a meaningless friendly.

Carlo Ancelotti will not be too concerned by his side's loss after picking a less than full strength team for the glamour friendly in the middle-east and will be expecting Real to continue their winning streak post-winter break.

Menez broke the deadlock in the 21st minute when he latched on to Nacho's under-hit back pass. The France forward provided a smart finish after feigning to shoot and cutting back onto his left foot before sliding the ball under Keylor Navas.

Milan doubled their lead minutes later when El Shaarawy shifted the ball from his left foot onto his right before firing a a precise finish past the helpless Navas from 20 yards.

Cristiano Ronaldo halved the deficit for Real after he was released down the right channel and shot from the edge of the box, finding a huge gap at the near post before Milan keeper Diego Lopez could set himself.

El Shaarawy restored Milan's two-goal advantage shortly after the restart when he found acres of space in the Real penalty area and shaped as if he were going for the far corner before dragging his shot to the near.

Milan put the game beyond Real when substitute Niang picked out the run of Pazzini who planted a header past Iker Casillas from the edge of the six-yard box, Karim Benzema completed the scoring for the night when he fired a penalty into the top corner.
