More than 25 fires are burning across NSW as firefighters and residents brace themselves for hot and windy conditions.

While extreme heatwave conditions are expected to hit parts of the nation over the next three days, several fire bans are already in place across NSW, including greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Hunter.

NSW Rural Fire Service said as of Friday morning, 27 fires were burning at an advice level.

Before midday, the RFS tweeted six of the 27 fires across NSW are uncontained.

'They're not actually threatening any properties at this stage, mostly burning in remote locations away from any residential areas,' an RFS spokeswoman said.

Temperatures are forecast to reach 38C in the city on Friday and up to 40C in the west.

The greatest area of concern for the RFS is through the centre of the state.

But Sydney isn't the only state experiencing the blistering heat as the Bureau of Meteorology says a severe heatwave will hit other parts of the nation over the next three days.

Pockets of extreme heatwave conditions are expected in northwestern areas of the Northern Territory, Queensland's west coast of Cape York Peninsula, the southern interior and southeast of the state.  

Extreme heatwave conditions are expected for Friday, Saturday and Sunday

David Jenkins, the bureau's weather forecaster, told Daily Mail Australia such heat isn't unusual for this time of year

NSW Rural Fire Service said there were 27 fires across NSW, six of which were uncontained 

'Low intensity heat wave conditions extend from the northeastern half of the Northern Territory through most of Queensland, excluding much of the east coast,' the bureau reports.

Lower-level conditions are also expected in northern parts of South Australia and northeast to far eastern areas of NSW, including most coastal regions.

There will also be low intensity heatwave conditions for parts of the Kimberley and northern interior of Western Australia. 

David Jenkins, the bureau's weather forecaster, told Daily Mail Australia such heat isn't unusual for this time of year.

He says conditions are expected to ease up for Queensland and the Northern Territory on Tuesday.

'A clearing front will come through for Sydney on Monday,' he said.

Severe fire danger warnings have been issued for the greater Sydney region, north western and central ranges, upper central west plains and greater hunter.

Total fire bans have been declared in those areas.

Strong winds are predicted to come through on Friday afternoon with the RFS warning residents to be vigilant.
