Jailed: Prolific burglar Darren Williams was 'clobbered' with a walking stick as he tried to burgle a pensioner

A prolific burglar who was caught after a have-a-go-hero pensioner 'clobbered' him with his walking stick has been jailed.

George Clewlow, 78, leapt into action after Darren Williams broke into his bungalow last July.

He used his wooden walking stick to whack Williams, 43, over the head as he tried to clamber through an open living room window at his home in Penkhull, Staffs.

Williams fled empty-handed but was caught when police used samples of his DNA left on the window handle and it provided a match for the career criminal.

He was jailed for three years after he admitted burglary at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday.

The court heard Williams, of Stoke-on-Trent, had 22 convictions for house burglaries dating back nearly 30 years.

Judge David Fletcher, told him: 'You have an appalling record - 22 house burglaries, all since 1986.

'You have nothing of a recent vintage, which is mainly because of a lengthy prison sentence.'

Robert Holt, defending, said: 'This was an opportunistic offence, it was not a targeted property.'

Yesterday Mr Clewlow, a retired bricklayer, said Williams should have received a longer sentence.

He said: 'He's not going to stop until someone gives him a really good hiding.

'I had no idea what it was. At first I thought it could be just the wind, so I went to the toilet.

'When I came back I could see someone coming through, so I clobbered him with my stick, and after I had a poke at him he ran off.

'I watched him run all the way down the road - I wasn't sure if I'd be able to recognise him because of the dark, but I remembered he ran like a little monkey.

'After he ran off I made myself a cup of tea to steady myself.

Brave: George Clewlow used his wooden walking stick to whack Williams, 43, over the head as he tried to clamber through an open living room window at his home in Penkhull, Staffs.

'I wasn't sure whether I should go next door to tell the neighbours someone tried to break in, but then I remembered someone had put a card through the door with a police number on it, so I called that.

'The more I thought about it the more difficult it was - I keep checking my windows and doors are locked, and every time I get up in the night I look to that window.

'Luckily my daughter lives near me, which helps a lot, but when my allotment was broken into a few weeks later and someone took all my gardening equipment that shook me a bit.

'The police have been great, and our local officer Katy Thorneycroft checks up on me to make sure I'm safe, but he should have got a longer sentence.

'My mum got broken into and she never spoke again, so it can ruin people's lives.

'If it had been two more minutes he would have been in the house and it would have been a much bigger confrontation, and he knows these bungalows are all for elderly people, so he must have planned it.'
