She's outselling J.K Rowling and has penned the fastest selling debut since 50 Shades of Grey but just a year ago, Jessie Burton was struggling to make ends meet.

A would-be actress moonlighting as a PA to get by, the 31-year-old Londoner spent her evenings writing and re-writing the novel that would become this summer's biggest selling debut, The Minaturist.

No-one is more surprised by her success than Burton, who says the last few months been 'a dream' while describing The Miniaturist's popularity as 'totally unexpected'.

Selling well: Jessie Burton's debut novel The Minaturist is currently outselling E.L James and J.K Rowling

Bestseller: Jessie's book, The Miniaturist, is currently number two in the book charts

'I didn't expect anything beyond it being
 published,' says Burton, modestly. 'That had always been the dream.

'Then for it to become a bestseller... I hadn't 
even thought about it. I had learned to manage my expectations, so all 
this is completely wonderful.'

With The Miniaturist currently sitting second in the book charts, life for Burton now consists of writing hard and flitting from interview to party.

It's all a far cry from her previous life as a struggling actress and sometime PA. 'The phone wasn't ringing much for acting
 auditions,' she admits.

'I had fallen a little out of love with the game of it and it made me feel powerless in my own life.'

With her days taken up by admin and auditions, Burton used her evenings to sketch out the draft of the book that would become The Minaturist, a 17th century yarn set in Amsterdam that revolves around a tiny dolls' house given to the heroine by her husband.

'Writing was a private expression of 
creativity when I was working in offices as a PA,' adds Burton.

'I had hoped to one day to
 catch the attention of a literary agent but it would have been crazy 
just to announce "I'm going to a writer now" because it's as unreliable 
as acting!'

Instead, she kept plugging away and, after four years of drafting version after version, finally had a manuscript to send out.

Surprisingly in light of the book's enormous success, Burton at first met with rejection. 'I had polite rejections from literary agents and was
 sometimes just met with a wall of silence,' she explains.

'But all you need is one 
gesture of encouragement to carry on. I couldn't do much else with 
myself other than act and write, so I just carried on.'

Succour came in the shape of literary agent Juliet Mushens, who took her on after reading the first three chapters of The Miniaturist.

Inspiration: Jessie's debut novel was inspired by her travels in Amsterdam and is set in a 17th century version

From there, things began to snowball with Mushens securing a six-figure publishing deal with Picador following an intense bidding war.

Burton, you can't help but sense, is still happily reeling at her unexpected success. Nevertheless, she says she won't be resting on her laurels and is already hard at work on another book.

'It's called Belonging,' she reveals of novel number two. 'It's about an 
artist who is disgraced and disappears during the Spanish Civil War.

'30 years on, a woman with a secret finds her life thrown into turmoil when 
his missing works turn up in her London gallery. It's about art and 
identity, war, and finding love and friendship in unorthodox places.'

But with a tour of the U.S planned for September and requests for appearances and signings flooding in, it might be a while before readers can get their hands on it.

In the meantime, Burton is off on a well-earned holiday with boyfriend Pip Carter and says she'll be catching up on a reading list of her own.

Busy: Jessie's next stop is a tour of the U.S, after which she will go back to writing her second novel

'My all time favourites are Jane Eyre, The 
Blind Assassin, The Handmaid's Tale, Mansfield Park, Moon Tiger, The 
Sea and Wolf Hall,' declares the avid reader, mischievously adding: 'But that's just today!'

She credits her love of reading with her
 writing success but says she still has some way to go before becoming comfortable with the idea of being favourably compared to another of her
 favourite writers - Harry Potter author J.K Rowling.

'I think I've a long, long way to go before I can even consider that compliment,' she laughs, gracefully brushing off the comparison. 'She's one of my heroes.'

Despite her protests, it remains an apt comparison. Like Rowling, she has enjoyed tremendous success with her debut novel and, like the Scottish author, has seen her life transformed.

'It's funny really,' she adds. 'I feel like the same
 person but, yet, with more freedom and more responsibilities.

'Life has 
opened up a bit. Obviously the nod of acknowledgment from the 
publishing world has made a huge difference to my self-esteem.

'I 
knew I could create things, I just needed someone to give me that 
chance. But on a day to day basis, I hope my friends would say I'm 
exactly the same as I ever was.'

Jessie Burton's debut novel The Miniaturist is published by Picador and costs £12.99

Publishing star: Literary agent Juliet Mushens, 27, knows a thing or two about getting books published

Like her client Jessie Burton, Juliet Mushens is one of the literary world's up-and-coming stars, albeit on the publishing side.

A literary agent working for the Agency Group, Mushens is the woman behind Burton's six-figure deal and knows better than anyone what it takes to pen a best seller.

Here, she reveals how to hit the big time with books:

PLAN YOUR NOVEL

'Decide on your genre, world and characters before you start writing. Many novelists run out of steam in a few chapters because the story won't sustain them over more than a few thousand words. Carry a notebook around with you and start paying attention to interesting stories, bits of conversation, or paintings: anything which sparks your imagination. Be on the lookout for the fascinating and the absurd. Some ideas won't be sustainable but some will be fertile ground for the imagination.

KNOW YOUR STORY

A lot of novels I get sent meander along. Know what your plot is and the journey which your characters are going on. You should know what the stakes are and why the reader will care about them. Build in suspense, keep the reader guessing. I know when I have something special on my desk when it stops feeling like work – I remember reading the full manuscript of The Fire Sermon by Francesca Haig when she submitted it and I printed it out to carry on reading it on the tube. It was no surprise to me when it went on to sell to 24 countries, with Dreamworks making the film.

BECOME A READER

The best writers are big readers. Look at novels which sell and those which don't, join a book group, browse bookshops and become comfortable with genre. I see a lot of submissions which say 'I have written a [insert genre here] novel but I have never read [insert genre here]'. You are shooting yourself in the foot. Learn what works from other writers, what the tropes are and how to subvert them, and your own work will become stronger. 

DON'T WRITE TO TRENDSPeople often get hung up on the bestseller lists but those books will have been commissioned 12-18 months earlier so you are already writing to something that is out of date. The best books can define trends or set new ones.

RESEARCH THE INDUSTRY

Is self-publishing right for you? Consider how to market and sell your work and if you expect to be able to reach a wide audience through Kindle sales. If you want to be traditionally published you need to find a literary agent. Find out which agencies accept submissions and how to send them your work - there's no point sending your Sci-Fi novel to someone who handles romance. Put the effort into submitting your novel that you would into applying for a job: proofread, edit, check, double-check. Submit the strongest work you can. Gone are the days when agents were faceless entities: now you can meet them at writing festivals or connect with them on Twitter.

LEARN FROM REJECTION

Writing is a long process and the road to success is littered with rejection. Some of my bestselling authors had years of rejections before I signed them: Mary Chamberlain's novel, The Dressmaker of Dachau, will publish next year in 14 languages and she is in her 60s. Jessie Burton had a novel before The Miniaturist which no agent signed. No one likes rejection but if you love writing, keep persevering and figure out why this book hasn’t been a success. As an agent I get hundreds of rejections from publishers, but it just makes me want to work harder to find the right book.

KEEP TRYING

I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing. My entire client list came from unsolicited submissions and I am passionate about finding new voices. None of my authors got signed for their first book, and in some cases, the book I signed them for originally wasn't the one that sold to a publisher. Every writer has a rejection folder but you learn from everything you write and you will improve with every book.

LOVE WHAT YOU DO

If you go into publishing with the belief you're going to make lots of money, you are liable to be disappointed. Some of my authors do make six or even seven figures from their writing, but the vast majority work a day job too. What needs to keep you going is your passion for writing. One of my authors told me that even if her next book didn't sell she would still carry on writing - writing brought her so much joy that the deal was just the cherry on the cake. I only sign books which I feel passionately about. I work hard for my authors because I want them to succeed and nothing beats the moment you call someone in the middle of their working day and say "Are you sitting down? I have some wonderful news."
