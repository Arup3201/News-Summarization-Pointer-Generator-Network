A proud giraffe has been standing tall following the arrival of her newborn calf at a zoo in Germany.

The offspring measures around six feet tall and was born at Dortmund Zoo this week to the delight of its mother, her keepers and members of the public.

Its mother Gambela has been lavishing the newborn with plenty of attention inside their enclosure ever since.

What's in a name? The calf is still to be named and keepers are searching for a lucky visitor who will pick it

But the calf is still to be named, with keepers searching for a lucky visitor to become its godfather or godmother and have the honour of picking it.

Zoo staff are insisting, however, that its name will start with a 'Z' and have placed Zuli, Zikomo and Zebenjo on the shortlist.

The gestation period for giraffes lasts around 15 months and calves spend up to 12 weeks reliant on their mother's milk.

They weigh around 15 stone at birth and grow very quickly, with most calves nearly doubling in height in the first year alone.

It follows the birth of a rare giraffe listed as an endangered subspecies in the United States.

Petal, a six-year-old Rothschild giraffe, gave birth to a female calf on Friday at a conservation centre in Connecticut.

Founder and director of the LEO Zoological Conservation Center, Marcella Leone, watched the birth alongside staff and a group of other giraffes.

When fully grown, the newborn, who will mingle with a group of five giraffes, which includes two pregnant giraffes, could reach 18 feet in height.

Staff had double cause for celebration because the calf is the first born at the off-exhibit centre.

Rothschild giraffes were named and described by Lord Walter Rothschild, a British zoologist, after an expedition to East Africa in the early 1900s.

It is one of the most endangered giraffe subspecies, with only a few hundred left in the wild.

The subspecies is also known as the Baringo giraffe, after the Lake Baringo area of Kenya, or the Ugandan giraffe.
