Murdered: The Facebook profile picture of Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, who was stabbed to death at a house party

A schoolgirl was stabbed to death at a house party hosted by a boy whose parents were away.

Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, was attacked at the home alone gathering in the early hours of Saturday.

A 19-year-old who was allegedly seen leaving the house covered in blood and with his finger almost severed was being questioned by police last night. It is believed Megan, who wanted to train as a midwife, knew the boy.

Megan's father David, 39, laid a floral tribute to his daughter at the scene of the murder in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, yesterday.

A card attached to it said: 'Megan Moosay, miss you more than words can say. You will always be in my thoughts and forever in my heart. Love you forever, Dad.'

Some of the teenagers who attended the party had been seen smoking cannabis in the cellar bar of a nearby pub in the hours before the attack.

It is believed Megan had gone to the house with at least one friend and may have been joined by others later.

Paramedics went to the house at 1.30am after calls saying a girl had been fatally injured. Despite attempts to revive her, she died at the scene.

A few minutes earlier, police had come across a 19-year-old in a street nearby who had a severe injury to one of his fingers.

A trail of blood ran from the house and a neighbour's Vauxhall Astra had blood spattered on the tyres.

One resident said a woman in her 40s and her teenage son had moved into the rented semi-detached house around three months ago. She said the boy had celebrated his 18th birthday about a month ago, adding: 'They seem like a nice family. I don't see much of them but when they moved in they did the front garden up so they are obviously house-proud.

'The boy has friends round in boy racer cars and you hear the odd blast of loud music but that is all. They have been no trouble.'

Another said he had heard loud music 
coming from the house on a number of occasions but had not noticed a 
party at the property on Friday evening.

It was suggested last night 
that the boy who lived at the house may have been at the pub when the 
attack took place.

Megan's friend Chelsie McAneny, 16, 
said her classmates at Harlington Upper School were planning to release 
balloons in  tribute to her.

Emergency: police and paramedics were called to the house at around 1.30 this morning

She added: 'She was the hero  at school. Everybody loved her  and knew her.

'She would stick up for everyone and 
was a great friend. She was really funny, sociable and bubbly. I can't 
believe what happened and still don't. It doesn't feel real.' Lorraine 
Adams – mother of Megan's best friend Dee, who was not at the party – 
said: 'She was such a beautiful girl.

'It has knocked everybody sideways. It's a great loss to everybody. She was a fantastic person.'

On her Bebo account Megan wrote that she was happiest when she was with 'my friends or with family or at a party'.

A post mortem examination was due to be carried out by a Home Office pathologist.
