The relaxed atmosphere in the Dutch camp was evident again at their latest World Cup training session, as Robin van Persie’s daughter joined in.

The Holland striker and Dina messed around with a football in the centre circle ahead of Louis van Gaal’s side’s last-16 clash with Mexico on Sunday.

Van Persie was a spectator for Holland’s 2-0 win over Chile on Monday after picking up yellow cards in wins over Spain and Australia.

Runs in the family: Van Persie's daughter Dina joins the striker for training ahead of their last-16 game

The Manchester United forward was pictured cheering Holland on though, as Arjen Robben inspired them to a comfortable win and eased their passage into the knockout rounds.

Van Persie is one of the top scorers at the tournament in Brazil, with three goals in his two appearances so far. 

Composed: Unlike her famous father, Dina appears to be right-footed as she passes the ball to the Holland star

Control: Van Persie shows a neat touch in training to bring the ball under his spell using his left foot
