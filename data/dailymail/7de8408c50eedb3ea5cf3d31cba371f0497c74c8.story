Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus have written a book about their decade-long ordeal in Cleveland

Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, two of the women held captive and sexually abused in a Cleveland home for nearly a decade, have penned a book about their harrowing ordeal.

The women, who escaped the home with a third kidnapping victim, Michelle Knight, in May 2013, will release the memoir, 'Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland', on April 28.

In the book, they each describe how they were lured to the home by kidnapper Ariel Castro - Berry in 2003, when she was 16, and DeJesus in 2004, when she was just 14. 

Following their capture, they stayed hopeful by watching news reports of their families' searches.

'They never gave up, and that gave us strength,' the book says, according to People.com.

'We videotaped news coverage of them holding vigils and replayed those tapes on our most desperate days.'

The book also details how Castro psychologically, emotionally and sexually abused them, People.com reported.

They recall their daily fear as they were chained to beds, starved and sexually abused - but also how they banded together to celebrate birthdays and the birth of Berry's daughter, Jocelyn, now eight.  

'Our story is not just about chains, lies and misery,' they say in the book. 'That was Ariel Castro's world. Our story is about overcoming all that. 

'We survived, we are free, we love life. We were stronger than Ariel Castro.'

The women eventually escaped on May 6, 2013 after Berry ran through the open front door and signaled to neighbors for help. 

Castro was arrested and pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping and rape, and sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years.

A month later, the 53-year-old hanged himself in his prison cell.

The women have since been working to rebuild their lives and reconnect with their families. The three women split $1.4 million in donations collected after their escape.

Berry, now 28, and DeJesus, 24, recently visited the White House where they met Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, and in February last year, Ohio Governor John Kasich honored the three women with the state's courage award.

They have lost contact with their fellow survivor, Michelle Knight, as they try to heal on their own.

'I love them and they love me,' Knight told People last year. 'Hopefully we'll all get back together again.' 

Knight, who was 21 when Castro lured her to his home in August 2002, released her own book, 'Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed', last May and it spent five weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers List.

DeJesus and Berry have penned their memoir with the help of Pulitzer Prize winners, Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, and it will be published by Penguin.

On Amazon, the Kindle version is priced at $14.99, while hardcover is $21.11.
