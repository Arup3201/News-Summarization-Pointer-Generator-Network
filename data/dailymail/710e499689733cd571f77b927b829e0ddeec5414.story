This three-year-old already knows the importance of budgeting. 

Adorable Nova is clearly anxious of over the loss of her money and is set to get to the bottom of the mystery of her missing dollars.

The questioning - shown on a video uploaded to YouTube by her father - starts  with her dad asking her just how much her mother had spent shopping and what was it she bought.

‘How much did mummy spend?’ he asks. 

The child is certain of the amount, saying ‘$80,’ but only holds up four fingers.

‘I did not!’ a voice says from the background, just as the child reiterates her statement, claiming that her mother had used a credit card to spend the money.

But she quickly corrects herself, telling her father: ‘She used your dollars.’

Her face is serious as she tries to convey the severity of the situation to her clearly amused father, who fights to contain his giggles.

‘What did she buy?’ the father questions. 

Adorable three-year-old Nova first blames her mother, and then her father, for taking her money

‘She bought a “frozen” and a playdough,' the girl says in the four-minute clip, punching the air to stress her point.

But unbeknownst to her, she’s walked right into a trap as her father’s next question has her confused.

‘Now why would she buy that?’ he asks. But Nova turns away and in a barely audible whisper says, ‘I wanted playdough’.

Her father pursues the subject, ‘Did you have money? Did you buy the playdough? Then why did you ask for it if you don’t have the money?’

She wanted 'playdough': Nova's story changes and she stumbles at one point as she weaves her tangled tale

‘I have money,’ she says, certain of her financial independence.

And in a swift move, Nova turns the tables neatly and her father now finds himself at the end of a barrage of accusations.

‘You took my money,’ she says. He’s shocked at being dragged into the blame game and denies taking her cash but Nova is not interested in his side of the story.

The three-year-old seems quite sure of the exact time and place the incident occurs and continues to eloquently explain just what happened and how much money was pilfered.

‘You take my money to your work, when you’re going to work, you take my money’, she says in her endearingly lilting tones.

She is certain that her father spent ‘ $20 of my money’ and swiftly becomes the inquisitor, asking, ‘Why, why did you take my money?’

Nova is convinced that her father owes her 'twenty-eighty-nine dollars.' The eloquentlittle girl spends nearly four minutes trying to get to the bottom of the mystery of her missing dollars

‘I want my money back,’ she beseeches. ‘Is it in your pocket? Did you leave it in the store?’

‘I didn’t take your money,’ her father says, but to no avail as Nova is convinced he now has her cash.

‘How much does Daddy owe you?’ her mother asks.

’Twenty-eighty-nine dollars,’ Nova says, as both her parents try to stop themselves from laughing out loud.

They quickly change the subject, asking the child what was purchased with the precious dollars.

‘I bought eat and then I went to the store and then I bought a whole bag of frozen,’ she rambles on.

‘Why would you buy a whole bag of frozen stuff,?’ her father asks. 

Disconcerted by this line of questioning, Nova is at a loss for words and stumbles on her sentences as she tries to clear her thoughts and explain to her father just what happened.

She quickly gains her composure, saying, ‘You took my money, I didn’t take your money, you did’ and goes on to explain what was bought and how much was spent.

‘It’s not true, Nova’ her mother admonishes as the little girl’s story gets more and more tangled.

‘You guys spent $28 on toys?’ the father asks in mock disbelief as Nova’s mother is heard protesting in the background.

‘Mummy bought your medicine because you were sick and then we went to eat breakfast,’ the mother says, clarifying just what happened.

‘You’re something else!’ Nova says, pointing at her mother. ‘You’re taking all my money!’

‘I am not something else, I am your mother!’ her mum says, just as the father is unable to control himself any longer and starts laughing.
