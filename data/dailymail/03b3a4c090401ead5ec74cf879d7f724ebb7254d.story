With visits to New York and the Netherlands already under her belt this month, Spain's Queen Letizia racked up yet more air miles with a trip to Vienna.

Although without husband King Felipe, the 42-year-old  looked relaxed and happy as she arrived at the Hofburg Palace in the Austrian capital, to be met by President Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit.

Dressed in a chic tweed skirt suit and a simple white top, Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she posed for photos with the presidential couple, ahead of a visit to the Kunsthistorisches Museum.

Nice to meet you: Queen Letizia is greeted by Austrian president Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit

Launch: Queen Letizia was in Vienna for the launch of an exhibition dedicated to artist, Diego Velázquez

There, joined once more by President Fischer and his wife, she officially opened the museum's new Velázquez exhibition, which is dedicated to the work of one of Spain's most famous painters.

Diego Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum.

The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe.

Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.

All smiles: Letizia looked relaxed and at ease, despite being without husband King Felipe

Striking: Diego Velázquez' most famous painting is Las Meninas, which was created for King Felipe VI

Patron: Since her reign began in June, Letizia has devoted herself to promoting Spanish culture abroad

Highlights: Other paintings in the exhibition include 1635's Infante Baltasar Carlos on Horseback

It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood.

Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita.

Among the works set to go on display at the Kunsthistorisches Museum is another of the doomed princess, this time alone and as a pretty four-year-old.

Other works included in the exhibition are Infante Baltasar Carlos with a dwarf (1631) and Venus at her toilet (1648).

Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made  supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary.

Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague among her most recent trips.

Tragic: Infanta Margarita Theresa, who died aged just 21 in Vienna, also features in another painting

Missing out: King Felipe, pictured visiting the village of Boal on Saturday, chose to remain in Madrid
