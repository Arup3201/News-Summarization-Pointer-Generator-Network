Comments: Sir Christopher Meyer's attack on the inquiry is the strongest yet

The Leveson inquiry has become a mixture of ‘show trial, seminar and truth commission’, according to a former ambassador.

Sir Christopher Meyer said there was a ‘whiff of totalitarianism’ about the inquiry into press standards and warned of the dangers of censoring newspapers.

The attack from the former head of the Press Complaints Commission is the strongest so far from an influential name outside the newspaper trade.

He said the tribunal’s remit was too ambitious and suggested that Lord Justice Leveson had already made up his mind to abolish the PCC and replace it with a new system of regulation.

The inquiry, set up by David Cameron last July in the wake of allegations that the News of the World hacked into the phone messages of murder victim Millie Dowler, is charged with examining the culture, practices and ethics of the press.

Sir Christopher, who served as UK ambassador in Washington, said: ‘Is there any proposal for press regulation which has come before Leveson, short of appointing a commissar in every news room with X-ray eyes and telepathic powers, that would have nipped phone-hacking in the bud?’

In a speech to the Worshipful Company of Stationers he said: ‘The Leveson inquiry, with its elements of show trial, seminar and truth commission, is a curious beast.

‘It runs in parallel with at least three police investigations looking into similar matters. No wonder there are anxieties among the police and those arrested that the proceedings of the inquiry might damage or prejudice their respective interests.’

Evidence: James Murdoch appears before the Commons Culture Committee inquiry into phone hacking for a second time last November

The PCC strengthened its rules for journalists after two News of the World employees were jailed over phone hacking in 2007. But it did not uncover the extent of hacking at the newspaper.

In a speech to the Worshipful Company of Stationers Sir Christopher said that the PCC ‘has been roundly and wrongly condemned’ for not having police powers to investigate wrongdoing.

But he said such powers would amount to ‘utterly objectionable’ state regulation.

Sir Christopher said: ‘As a formal judicial inquiry, it eclipses in legal standing the unfinished Chilcot Inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq War, a much more important subject.’

He added that Lord Justice Leveson ‘has 
made it pretty clear that something new is coming’ and that ‘the 
fundamental premise of the proceedings is that the current system of 
regulation is broken, has lost the confidence of the public and needs to
be replaced.’

The PCC gives satisfaction to more than 80 per cent of those who use it, Sir Christopher said. It should be strengthened, not abolished.

But, Sir Christopher said, ‘when I sought to make some of these points in Court 73, I have to say that there was a glazing of the eye from the inquisitor, a flare of irritation from the bench.’

He added: ‘We cannot wish away the Leveson Inquiry. After the expenditure of huge sums of public money, it will be expected to come up with a result, and that result will be a hugely important moment for our freedoms and for our democracy, already under multiple pressures.’

The inquiry had become a hot-house for debate about the media and society, Sir Christopher said. ‘A thousand flowers, and not a few weeds, bloom in the rich haul of witness statements.

‘Here and there a whiff of totalitarianism arises from the foliage. Some witnesses appear animated by the idea that here is such a thing as Truth with a capital T. There may well be, but we humans have only the most partial and imperfect access to it. In reality we live in a world of fiercely competing ideas and “truths”.’

Sir Christopher said that one of the great strengths of British democracy was the ‘campaigning partisanship of its newspapers’.

He advised Lord Justice Leveson: ‘Beware those who, flying the flag of objectivity, want to impose their version of the truth. That would cast open the door to the enemies of the open society.’
