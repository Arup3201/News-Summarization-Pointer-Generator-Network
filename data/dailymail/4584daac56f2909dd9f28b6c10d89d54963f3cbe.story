Immigration officials have arrested an illegal immigrant moments before he was about to take part in a sham marriage ceremony in north London.

Border officials had been tipped off by staff at the Hillingdon register office that so called 'happy couple' did not seem to be in a legitimate relationship.

The pair did not even speak the same language, it was reported.

UK Border Agency officials have released these images as part of a bid to tackle rising numbers of bogus weddings, the Evening Standard reports.

They went to Monday’s ceremony at the civic centre in Uxbridge and swooped on the man shortly before the wedding started. 

The 22-year-old Indian groom, who had been living in Harlington, was found to have over-stayed his visa and was arrested and detained for being in the country illegally.

He is expected to be deported.

His intended bride, a 23-year-old Hungarian woman who is here legally under EU law, was questioned and later released by officers. The pair did not share a common language.

Sarah Burton, from the UK Border Agency, said: 'We are working closely with registrars across the London to clamp down on sham weddings and civil partnerships.

'This operation is another example of the success that we are having.

'Where there are suspicions that a relationship may not be genuine we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene to stop it happening.'

Councillor Jonathan Bianco said: 'The London borough of Hillingdon takes its duty in regards to the institution of marriage seriously and is proud that our staff helped the UK Border Agency expose this sham marriage.

'Our staff are trained to look out for suspicious activity and helped raise the alarm in this case.

'We hope that it will act as a deterrent to others who may be considering a sham marriage and sends out a clear message that criminal activity won’t be tolerated.'

Last week a solicitor from Hatfield was jailed for 10 years for organising sham marriages on what was called 'an industrial scale', involving more than 1,000 couples and netting him and his accomplices an estimated £20 million.

Judge John Bevan said members of Souleiman GA solicitors had run a 'conveyor belt' of brides being flown in from eastern European countries. They would marry men they had never met from non-EU countries.

The UK Border Agency received more than 1,700 calls from registrars worried about sham marriages in 2011, double the number of the previous year.
