An artist is making her fortune by selling animal sculptures she makes out of rubbish fished out of bins and skips.

Barbara Franc, 58, collects junk like tin cans, costume jewellery and mechanical wires from the streets while walking her dog and uses them for her creations.

She also scours jumble and boot sales and charity shops to pick up other items such as clock mechanisms and windscreen wipers.

Used kitchen utensils, old keys and copper wiring helped make this model of a dog created by Barbara Franc

The two parrot figures have been made out of old sweet wrappers and the hare is made of metallic junk

Barbara turns the scrap into her stunning sculptures that include birds, cats, squirrels, horses, zebras, stags, hares and even a preying mantis.

She begins by making a rough 'sketch' out of wire of the animal and then covers it in recycled tin or pieces from her collection of scrap metal and junk.

Any alterations are made with a pair of 
pliers and snippers, before the tin is soldered in place and other items
are held by electrical copper wire.

Sculptures can range between 4ins and 4ft in size and a huge variety of animals are included in the collection

The griffin sculpture, made in 2011, is the only mythical creature that Barbara Franc has added to her collection

The frames of each animal are 'sketched' with wiring before the recycled materials are soldered on

The pieces range in size from 4ins to 4ft 6ins and cost anywhere from £135 to £2,000 each.

Barbara, from London, said: 'I make things because I can't imagine not doing that, and it is so worthwhile when a piece makes someone smile.

'I find a lot of my materials by keeping my eyes open when out walking the dog, I'll always have a quick look in any skip.

'A
lot of pieces are just lying on the ground, jumble sales and charity 
shops are also good, and a lot of friends save things for me.

This sculpture of a horse is entitled 'Time flies' because of the use of clockwork mechanisms in its frame

The range of trophy stags are made to look more eccentric, by having leaves or flowers in their mouths

Fishing for materials: Barbara Franc scours bins and skips to find items to make sculptures like this kingfisher

'The materials I use can be almost anything, a list would include food cans, old spanners, metal clips, costume jewellery, clock and watch pieces, copper electrical wire and plastic.

'At the moment I have two methods of 
working, the little birds involve making a 'sketch' or 'drawing' in wire
which I then partially cover in recycled tin.

'The
second method is a bit more complicated, I will make a very basic 
armature from wire netting but will keep the form very fluid.

'I
then make a total mess of my work surface when I lay out hundreds of 
bits and pieces of scrap metal from windscreen wipers to dog leads, 
keys, and cupboard handles.'

The collection of sculptures made by Barbara Franc includes unusual creatures such as this mantis figure

Discarded spatulas and old springs were soldered together to make this sculpture of a cow looking skywards
