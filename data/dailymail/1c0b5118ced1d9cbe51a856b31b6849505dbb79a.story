Neymar has been preparing for the biggest week of Barcelona's season in somewhat unconventional fashion - with a game of poker on Saturday night. 

The Brazilian star took to Instagram to show the friendly hand or two he was playing with a few friends to celebrate Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Eibar.

Lionel Messi netted a first half penalty, before doubling their lead with a rare header after the break as Barcelona moved four points clear at the top of La Liga.

Neymar also uploaded a picture of himself and Barcelona team-mates Douglas and Adriano on the journey home after the game.

It is a huge week coming up for the Catalan club. First they face the visit of Manchester City on Wednesday night in the Champions League - where they will aim to hold onto their 2-1 lead from the first leg.

Then next Sunday night there is the small matter of El Clasico, with Real Madrid travelling to the Nou Camp in a game that will go a long way in deciding the destination of the league title.
