Robust: The CPS has unveiled strict rules that would take pay-as-you-go phones from gang members

Gang members will be banned from wearing hoodies, owning pay-as-you-go phones, and riding bicycles in a new set of measures to break up their activities.

They will also be banished from the postcode their gang operates in.

The set of court orders was announced today by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Baljit Ubhey.

She told the Evening Standard: ‘It’s being able to identify people and limit the type of activity that they get involved in that would support ongiong gang activity.

‘Curtailing people’s ability to associate post-conviction is also a really good way to prevent further gang activity.'

She added: ‘We need to make sure that the Crown 
Prosecution Service is taking a really robust line when it comes to 
prosecuting gang crime.

'This has such an impact on communities that we’ve really got to take a very tough line.'

However, Colin James, the founder and senior mentor of Gangs Unite, blasted the measures as 'ridiculous' that 'will just make everything harder'.

He told MailOnline: 'I think some of those measures are ridiculous. Banning hoodies in the winter is just unfair. Do we stop everyone from wearing hoodies? Just stop making them. And bicycles - how is that going to help?

'I can understand that if they've got a phone in their name, they are then accountable for it. But the bicycle is going too far, and hoodies is going too far.

'They have done the robust approach. It 
is all robust, robust, robust. It means there are more obstacles than 
support so I think a little bit more effort should be put into support.'

Disagree: Colin James (right), founder and senior mentor of Gangs Unite, blasted the measures outlined today by Baljit Ubhey (left) as 'too robust'. He said the 'American-style' system provides too many obstacles to youths

He attacked the notion of specific 'gang prosecutors' as 'American': 'We are going too far in our American-style approach. We need to look at it from An English perspective and come up with an approach that works.

Tragic: Jimmy Mizen, 16, was murdered by Jake Fahri, 19, in May 2008 whilst at the Three Cook's Bakery in Lee, South East London

'The more rules and boundaries there are will just make them rebel more.

'We need to look at the reasons behind what they are doing and work with them.'

Junior Smart, founder of St Giles Trust SOS project, one of London's leading gang intervention services, also warned against  strict measures.

He told MailOnline: 'Enforcement measures such as those outlined here have their place when applied appropriately and take into account the situation of the individual concerned.

'However, in our experience in providing one of London's largest gang intervention projects, they absolutely must be accompanied with a package of support which addresses the reasons why young people are involved in gangs and which helps them leave gangs safely and permanently.'

Prince Charles has also announced his own volunteer-based initiative to deal with the soaring rates of violence among young people on Britain's streets.

It is a far cry from the strict, 'robust' lines Ms Ubhey is proposing to draw to curb violence.

Moved by the murder of 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen in 2008, the heir to the throne is leading an event called #iwill in Buckingham Palace next week.

Flanked by 50 young people, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, he will make a plea for more to be invested in groups such as The Guides and Scouts to give gang members 'a rite of passage'.

He said: 'The Mizens are convinced – as I have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution  is in providing more structured activities for young people.

'In my opinion, tragedies such as the murder of Barry and Margaret’s son are the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage; young people who would benefit from the guidance and help of organisations such as the Guides, Scouts, cadets and other youth organisations.

'However, these are all groups which are hampered in their growth by a lack of adult volunteers.

'That vision is that all of us, from all walks of life, will ‘step up’ and pledge, at #iwill, to help young people take every opportunity to be of service to others.

Initiative: Prince Charles, here with 
Barry and Margaret Mizen, is promoting volunteer-based gang initiatives

'I know that young people have an immense contribution to  make to our society, but I have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges.

'Young people are the solution to so much and yet, too frequently, they are seen as the problem.'
