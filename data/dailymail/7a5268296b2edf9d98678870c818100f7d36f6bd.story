Watching her mother battle pancreatic cancer, Alison Steadman yesterday revealed she considered giving her a lethal injection of drugs.

Opening up about the clearly painful memory of her mother Marjorie, the actress, 68, admitted she thought it would be ‘kind to let her go’ and end the agony she was in.  

The mother-of-three, who died at home at the age of 82, had advanced pancreatic cancer and doctors had told her there was nothing more that could be done.

Under current guidelines had one of Mrs Steadman’s daughters chosen to help her end her life, they would have been committing a criminal offence.

But giving an interview Miss Steadman, who is best known in recent years for starring in BBC comedy Gavin & Stacey, admitted the thought crossed her mind one night towards the end of her mother’s battle.

She said: ‘I just felt one night in particular I could have given her an injection because it would have been kind to let her go. But then I don’t know, it’s terribly difficult. But I think there should be more and more discussion and I just think other countries do it better.’

Miss Steadman’s experience of watching her mother die has helped her prepare for her latest television role.

She stars in The Secrets, which is a series of five dramas for the BBC that share the common theme of a dilemma.

In her 30-minute episode Miss Steadman plays a cancer patient who asks her daughter – a pregnant veterinary surgeon played by Olivia Colman – to help her die.

Asked whether she could imagine asking her sons Toby, 35, or Leo, 33, or her partner, Welsh actor Michael Elwyn, 72, to help her die, Miss Steadman, who found fame in Z Cars and Abigail’s Party, said: ‘We never know what we might do until we’re faced with it. I’m a terrible coward of all things medical, if I had my way I’d never see a doctor, never have an anaesthetic. I’m a terrible coward of dentists, I’m ridiculously bad about it.

'So I can’t imagine myself doing that. But listen, if you knew you were going to be in agonising pain and have a nightmarish few months, or you could just quietly take a drink and hug your daughter and just quietly drift off… maybe one would choose that.’

Miss Steadman’s comments come as peers prepare to scrutinise the Assisted Dying Bill, promoted by Lord Falconer, in a House of Lords committee. It aims to legalise the practice for some terminally ill patients.

It comes after a string of well-known names have backed assisted dying, including Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry, 79, who earlier this week said she would like her children to give her a pill should she become a burden

And in recent months a string of well-known names have backed assisted dying, including Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry, 79, who earlier this week said she would like her children to give her a pill should she become a burden.

Actress Jane Asher, 68, said she would have no hesitation in attending the Swiss euthanasia clinic Dignitas if she had an ‘unbearable’ terminal illness, while singer Cilla Black, 71, has also said she supports the clinic.  

TV hosts Judy Finnigan, 66, and husband Richard Madeley, 58, have agreed an assisted death pact should one fall seriously ill.

Revealing her own views on assisted suicide, Miss Steadman said: ‘We’ve got all these drugs that can just quietly put someone to sleep. A cat or a dog, we don’t let them suffer, but we let human beings suffer. I think it’s a very dangerous area to go into if you just start saying “oh we’ll just give so and so an injection”. Of course it’s a very dangerous situation.

But there are some situations where someone is so ill and suffering so much that if you allow one, two and three doctors to all give their separate opinion and then discuss it with the person who’s ill and their relatives, a lot of people would be put out of their misery and with dignity.’

The Secrets: The Dilemma begins on Sunday at 10.40pm on BBC1. The other four episodes will play out nightly throughout the following week.
