A Grade One listed seven bedroom Elizabethan mansion with three acres of sculpted gardens has been put up to rent just £2,000 a month.

Morville Hall, which is set in 2.9 acres of sculpted gardens near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, has been put up for rent by the National Trust.

Tenants will be able to roam the topiary
 gardens and enjoy the Georgian Italian style garden complete with a 1960s swimming pool - in London's expensive Knightsbridge the rental price would only just secure a tenant a 
one-bedroom flat.

The Elizabethan country house was built in 1546 before being acquired by Roger Smyth, who married into the local Cressett family.

Sat on the site of the abandoned Morville Priory the house was remodelled by architect William Baker in the mid-18th century on behalf of Bridgnorth MP Arthur Weaver.

It was bought by the National Trust in 1965 and now the organisation is renting it out for the first time.

Victoria Pocock, who is handling the property for estate agent Carter Jonas, said: 'The accommodation is spacious and well laid out, with seven bedrooms, several reception rooms, and a loggia which looks out on to the unspoilt Shropshire countryside'

A three-bedroom flat in the north wing of the main hall is also being offered for rent for £650-per-month

Despite the remoteness of the property and enjoying no nosey neighbours, the new tenants will have to get used to the occasional visitor who arranges guided tours by the Trust

Departing tenant Dr Chris Douglas  said: 'It is a fascinating mix - a Grade I manor house in a beautiful location with fine architecture and elegant pavilions, set in attractive and varied formal gardens next to the Grade I medieval church of St Gregory the Great'

Morville Hall is built on the former site of the abandoned Morville Priory - the religious building was built in the early 11th century for Benedictine monks.

The priory was closed in 1540 and surface remains destroyed to make way for Morville Hall, an Elizabethan grey stone-built country house. 

The building was bought by Roger Smyth, who married into the local Cressett family.

Morville
 Hall was extensively enlarged and expanded around 1750, by architect William Baker on behalf of Bridgnorth MP Arthur Weaver.

The remodeling gives it the appearance of a Georgian home - the Elizabethan topiary gardens reflect the age of the house, while the paved pool in the Italian gardens clearly showcase the luxurious style of the Georgians.  

In the 18th century the Weaver family moved in and then during the Victorian era the Warren sisters occupied the house until the last sister Juliana died in the 1920s.

Inside the grounds sits the Dower House, where garden historian and writer Katherine Swift famously spent 15 years developing a series of gardens.

Each section оf her garden relates tо а previous occupant оf the 
Hall -  frоm the Elizabethan Smyths through tо the 18th century Weavers.

The gardens were brought into the 21st century in the 1960s when a swimming pool was installed, although this has now bee filled with plants.

The Grade One listed property has belonged tо the National Trust since 1965.
