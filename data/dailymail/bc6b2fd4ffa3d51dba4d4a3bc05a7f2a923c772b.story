The husband of murdered Starbucks barista Whitney Heichel today revealed his anguish as it emerged she died after being shot multiple times.

The body of Whitney, 21, was found in a remote wooded area on Friday, three days after she failed to turn up for her 7am shift just two minutes from her home in Gresham, Oregon.

On Monday, medical examiner Dr Christopher Young revealed she died from multiple gunshot wounds, but declined to release further results from the autopsy.

'It's very difficult,' her husband, Clint Heichel, told Good Morning America. 'We only had a year and nine months together and when you get married you bet on forever.

Broken: Clint Heichel has spoken for the first time since his wife was found killed after disappearing last week

'She was very kind, she just loved everybody... She was just a beautiful little person and just full of love and a ray of love to everybody.

'She didn't do anything to deserve this. Why, is the only question. Why?'

Mr Heichel had appeared at a family press conference on Thursday, but had been unable to speak through his sobs as he clutched relatives.

In the GMA interview, he revealed that the man arrested on suspicion of the murder, 24-year-old Jonathan Holt, was married and lived with his wife in their apartment complex.

The Heichels, who attended the same church as Holt, took care of his cats and plants while he was away and, two weeks ago, Mr Heichel even helped him jump start his motorbike, he said.

Holt was arrested after Whitney's body was found on Larch Mountain, a remote forested area east of Gresham. Police collected DNA and fingerprints and carried out interviews.

Police say they found 
inconsistencies in the stories that Holt told investigators over the 
course of two interviews. They added he is also tied to the crime by DNA evidence, but they would not elaborate.

Authorities did not comment on whether they have a theory of what led to the killing.

The Starbucks barista reportedly left
her apartment for work at about 6.45am on Tuesday on a drive that 
typically takes less than five minutes.

Her husband called police 
roughly three hours later. He told investigators he tried to reach 
Heichel multiple times after her boss alerted him that she never arrived
for her 7am shift.

Police said Heichel's ATM card was 
used at a nearby Troutdale gas station at 9.14am on Tuesday. Two hours 
later, her SUV was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot 
with the passenger window smashed.

A child later found her cell phone in
a field that lies between the gas station and the Wal-Mart, giving 
investigators another venue to search.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Lorilei Ritmiller said her 
daughter's nickname in the family is 'Mama,' as she was like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings.

Ritmiller
added that her daughter was a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness 
with a 'heart as big as the sun,' and her greatest hope was to have 
children of her own.

Hunt: Clint alerted authorities after Heichel failed to turn up for work on Tuesday in Gresham, Oregon

'She's
wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her 
sister home,' she said. 'That was just her biggest hope, to have 
babies.'

Jim Vaughn, a family spokesman, spoke at a Friday night news conference and thanked police for their commitment in the case.

'Really, words can't begin to express the sadness that our families are experiencing tonight,' Vaughn said.

Whitney was an active member of the Jehovah's Witness community, who released a statement with the family on Saturday night.

'We
are profoundly devastated by the loss of Whitney Heichel,' the 
statement read. 'She was a loved and valued member of our faith. No 
words can express the pain and agony her family and friends are 
undergoing as we cope with the bewildering loss of Whitney. We will 
continue to support and help one another in this time of grief.'

Desperate plea: While Clint Heichel, left, was 
too overcome with emotion to speak to reporters, her mother, right, 
begged for the 21-year-old's safe return before her remains were found 
on Friday

It continued: 'The outpouring of support from members of 
our faith has been such an aid in helping us to deal with the pain and 
loss of such a wonderful person. For us, this is not a surprise, because
this is “what we do” as an organization.'

The statement also passed on the 
gratitude of Whitney's mother and husband for the help they have 
received from volunteers and authorities.

Police received 25 phone tips on 
Wednesday and another 21 that night. Two dozen detectives were assigned 
to the case that had been classified as a suspicious disappearance.

Friends
had said that a gas station attendant claimed that Heichel's vehicle, 
which was found with the window smashed in, had been driven 
by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the
passenger seat.

Abandoned: Her black 1999 Ford Explorer was found in a WalMart parking lot four miles from her home with a window smashed. It looked as if it had been rummaged through, friends said

Targeted: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park

Her husband told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift.

'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday.

'(At)
about 8:15 her boss called me and said, "Hey, I was just curious, did 
Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or 
talked to her?"' he told KATU.

Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond.

Worried, he drove to her parents' home 
and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and 
friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts.

When they could provide no further 
information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and 
friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her.

Remembered: It came just hours after her body was found on a remote mountainside

Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station around four miles from her home at 9.14am.

Her
missing poster claimed an attendant said the man driving the car bought
a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this.

At 1pm, family and friends looking for
Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village.

It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster.

He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is 
married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't 
know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.'
