Manchester United have shown their Christmas spirit by awarding one life-long fan with a particular heart-warming gesture.

Mr Fink is the Red Devils' longest-serving season ticket holder - having watched his team play at Old Trafford since 1945.

And in the season of giving, United commended him for his continued support with a special visit from club legend Bryan Robson.

Robson, who made 461 appearances during a glittering 13-year career at the Theatre of Dreams, greeted Mr Fink with a personalised home shirt with 'Fink 1945' on the back.

The gesture was greeted with a smile by Mr Fink who took the time to show Robson his season tickets throughout the years.

When asked by Robson what his best memory at Old Trafford has been during his 69 years as a season ticket holder, Mr Fink was quick to pinpoint one 1957 European Cup game during Sir Matt Busby's reign as manager - a 3-0 quarter-final second leg win against Athletic Bilbao. 

Played at local rivals Manchester City's Maine Road; goals from Johnny Berry, Tommy Taylor and Dennis Viollet saw United win 6-5 on aggregate.

'The biggest game and the most sensational was when we played Bilbao in the European Cup,' Mr Fink reflected. We need to win 3-0 because we had lost the first leg [5-3] and we turned it around.

Mr Fink will be hoping for another memorable United performance when Louis van Gaal's side host Newcastle in the Premier League on Boxing Day.
