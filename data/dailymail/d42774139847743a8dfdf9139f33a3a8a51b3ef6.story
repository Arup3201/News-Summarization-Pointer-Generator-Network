A householder who trapped a suspected burglar inside his home told of his fury yesterday after police let the man go.

Tim Ferris, 53, realised at 2.30am that there was a man inside the rear porch of his house and that he was trying to break down an inside door.

He dashed out of the front door, ran round his house and locked the rear porch door, effectively trapping the intruder inside the porch space.

Angry: Estate agent Tim Ferris has criticised police after a man he caught trying to barge into his home was released without charge

But Mr Ferris, an estate agent, said 
that after he had handed him over to the police, officers seemed 
reluctant to arrest the man for attempted burglary and only did so when 
he insisted.

He claimed they refused to take his statement about the attempted break-in because they were already late finishing their shift.

When he spoke to police the next day, he discovered to his fury that they had released the intruder without charge.

They had seemingly accepted the man’s 
explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken Mr Ferris’s house for his own
home, and was trying to let himself in.

Mr Ferris said he did not believe the 
explanation, and questioned why a drunk man would climb over a 4ft 6in 
gate and try to ‘shoulder-barge’ his way into his own home. ‘It doesn’t 
look like the police asked many questions or made much of an effort to 
investigate the case,’ he said..

Dumfounded: Mr Ferris was woken by his labrador Sparky, left, to find a man trying to barge into his home through the back door, right, but police decided not charge the suspect with any offence

‘This was despite the fact I had 
caught the guy and detained him. I offered to give a statement and had 
done most of the officers’ work. Their excuses for not charging him are 
lame.

‘What is the point in trying to protect your home if the police do not back you?’

Mr Ferris said he was asleep with his 
girlfriend at his secluded, detached house in February when he heard his
black labrador Sparky barking to raise the alarm. He raced downstairs 
and locked the man inside the porch.

Mr Ferris said it took police 25 minutes to reach his £850,000 home in Bearsted, near Maidstone, Kent.

And he questioned why officers had later accepted the intruder’s explanation and released him.

Mr Ferris said: ‘First police told me 
the man had been drunk – but they didn’t charge him with being drunk and
disorderly and he seemed sober to me.

Not happy: Mr Ferris said he cannot understand why police did not charge the man when he done 'most of the work for them'

‘Then they said he had mistakenly been
trying to get into the wrong house – but I heard him tell them he lived
about 15 miles away in Tenterden.

‘I was furious when the police phoned 
me the following morning to say they were releasing him because he had 
not done anything wrong. It was a farce.

‘If the man wasn’t drunk why didn’t they charge him with attempted burglary?’

Mr Ferris has made a formal complaint 
to Kent Police about their handling of the incident. A spokesman said: 
‘A man was arrested at the scene but later released without charge.

‘We are carrying out a full review of 
the incident. We will be working with Mr Ferris to resolve his 
dissatisfaction with the service he received.’

The spokesman added: ‘It is absolutely
untrue to suggest people are getting away with crime because we don’t 
have sufficient resources to respond to incidents and crimes in 
progress.

‘We have officers available around the clock to respond to crimes.’
