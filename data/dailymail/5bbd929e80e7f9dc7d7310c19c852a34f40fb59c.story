The US military has deployed its first laser weapon ever to be used in combat.

The science fiction made real armament is seven years in the making and comes at a cost of $40 million.

Dubbed the 30-kilowatt-class Laser Weapon System, the devices was installed onto the USS Ponce in August, where the warship has been patrolling with it ever since.

Navy officials say the weapon can set fire to targets at the speed of light. Those targets include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats, all potential threats to warships in the Persian Gulf, where the Ponce, a floating staging base, is deployed.

Zap: The Navy officially launched the Laser Weapon System in August, the first ever laser combat weapon

Bloomberg reports that the system was given the okay for use in the field after passing a series of at-sea tests.

'I have to take it out and get it wet, and the Arabian Gulf's a pretty tough environment,' Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert said.

For the Navy, it's not so much about the whiz-bang technology as it is about the economics of such an armament, which costs pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and smart bombs, and the weapons can be fired continuously, unlike missiles and bombs, which eventually run out.

The weapon has several power levels.

The laser weapon system (LaWS) prototype combines light beams from six commercial, off-the-shelf solid-state welding lasers.

Each beam has a power of 5.5 kilowats, to create a laser with a total power of round 33 kW.

The light from the six lasers is said to be incoherently combined because the individual beams are not merged into a true single beam (i.e., the individual beams are not brought in phase with each other).

The laser actually uses six separate, commercial welding lasers that combine into a more powerful series of beams that can set fire to moving targets

Although the beams are quite close to one another, they remain separate and out of phase with each other, and are steered and focused by the beam director so that they converge into a single spot when they reach the intended target. 

Coherently combining the six beams into a true single beam (i.e., one in which the six beams are “phase locked”) would require a system with more-complex internal optics and electronic control systems.

Persian Gulf: The laser system is mounted aboard the USS Ponce, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf and plans to use the weapon to fend of troublesome Iranian 'swarm' forces that use several smaller boats to attack much larger vessels

It may be used as a 'dazzling' warning shot to deter enemies or turned 'all the way up to lethal' said Chief of Naval Research Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder.'

The weapon's range remains classified.

Shooting the laser costs about $1 per shot, according to the Navy's July 31 report.

Just like in the movies, the Navy's laser directs a beam of energy that can burn through a target or fry sensitive electronics. Unlike the movie, the laser beam is invisible to the human eye.

The targeting system locks onto the target, sending a beam of searing heat.

The Navy hopes that the laser will be invaluable in combating the small Iranian fast boats and surveillance drones that harass U.S. vessels in the area.

This earlier iteration of the weapon is one of multiple prototypes tested. The current prototype was give the okay for use in the field after at-sea testing

The solid-state Laser Weapon System is designed to target what the Navy describes as 'asymmetrical threats'

Those include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats -- all are potential threats in the Persian Gulf, specifically from Iranian forces

The system is aboard the USS Ponce, which has been patrolling with the weapon since late August
