She has spent every day of the past 84 years inside the walls of her convent in central Spain.

Now, however, 103-year-old nun Sister Teresita will finally emerge into the outside world on Friday for a very special occasion.

The nun will meet Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to the Spanish capital of Madrid to celebrate World Youth Day.

Devout: Sister Teresita will leave her convent in central Spain for the first time in 84 years this week

Sister Teresita is a member of the Buenafuente del Sistal Convent, which is located around 60miles north of Madrid.

She has been a resident at the convent since April 16, 1927. This, by coincidence, is the same day that Joesph Ratzinger - now Pope Benedict XVI - was born.

The last time the centenarian left the compound was during the Spanish Civil war, which took place between 1936 and 1939.

Even then she only fled for a few hours at a time to escape the overnight fighting.

The convent's mother superior, named only as Maria, said: 'She said she thinks she will make the trip with her eyes closed, so that nothing will distract her.'

Meeting: Sister Terestia will meet with Pope Benedict XVI in Madrid

Sister Teresita is a minor celebrity in the area around the nunnery after a book was published detailing her life inside the convent.

In the book, titled "What is a girl like you doing in a place like that", she is quoted as saying: 'Who can spend 84 years in a convent without being happy? Of course I’m happy.'

She adds in the book that she was encouraged into the Church by her father, who said that it was a way for them to escape extreme poverty.

She claims that when she entered the convent she only had a vague idea of what life would be like and that over the years she found happiness.

Sister Teresita's visit to Madrid comes as thousands congregate there to welcome the Pope.

Pilgrims will camp out under the stars in an area the size of 48 football pitches ahead of his visit, which begins on Thursday.

The city has been transformed with yellow and white banners lining the streets, while religious events and concerts have been planned. Huge screens have also been erected to broadcast the events across the city.

Sister Teresita has also lived through the reigns of seven different Popes, including Pius XII, John XXIII and Paul VI.

An air-base in the south west of the city has also been transformed to hold a huge open air mass on Sunday at the end of the papal visit.

Hundreds of priests, speaking 30 languages, have also been called in to listen to sins in 200 specially constructed confessional booths.

However, the visit has stirred up tensions in the country, with many asking how the Government can afford to spend the money on the visit during its economic crisis.

One group of protestors have set up camps in Madrid to vent their frustration at unemployment and political corruption.

A spokesman for the movement said: 'With the economic crisis we are going through, we can't pay for this. The Church should set the example.' 

However the organisers of the event say that an estimate 50m euro cost will be met by  pilgrims’ registration fees and corporate sponsorship.

They added that the event could inject around 100m euros into the Spanish economy.
