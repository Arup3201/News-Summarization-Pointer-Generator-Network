Generous: Hollywood producer David Gundlach has stunned his hometown by leaving $125 million in his will to a local charity

A Hollywood producer has stunned his hometown by leaving $125 million in his will to a local charity.

David Gundlach, producer of Get Low, left the enormous sum to the Elkhart County Community Foundation, in Elkhart, Indiana.

It followed his sudden death last October from a heart attack at the age of 56.

The late businessmen will now go into
the small town's history books for his huge gift, which will allow the 
charity to hand out 10 times more money than ever before.

Speaking
to the New York Daily News, Pete McCown, the foundation's president, 
said: 'The scale of impact that this gift will have on this community is
quite historic.

'For us, on a per capita basis, it will have remarkable effects.'

The wealthy entrepreneur and producer owned a movie production company in Los Angeles.

He produced the 2009 drama film Get Low, which starred Robert Duvall, Bill Murray and Sissy Spacek.

Duvall was awarded the Hollywood Award for Best Actor in October 2010 and the film received positive reviews from critics.

Despite this, Mr Gundlach made his fortune mainly through the insurance company Hastings Direct, which he established abroad.

But he remained quiet about his huge wealth, with his 94-year-old mother Marjorie Smith unaware of her son's vast fortune.

Speaking to Fox 28, she said: 'I knew he was taking care of himself and not borrowing from me, but I had no idea he was that successful.'

Mr Gundlach did not leave any directions on how the money should be best spent, allowing the charity to distribute the vast sums how they think best.

The gift from Mr Gundlach will triple the size of the charity's overall value.
