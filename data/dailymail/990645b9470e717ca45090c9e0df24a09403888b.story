Doctors at Bellevue Hospital are so busy caring for Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer that they have begun transferring patients out of the intensive care unit to nearby NYU Langone Medical Center.

Bellevue, one of the the most respected hospitals in the nation, is treating its first ever case of Ebola after Dr Craig Spencer arrived at the hospital last week with symptoms of the disease. 

Until Monday night, doctors were also concerned that Bronx boy who has recently been to Africa also had Ebola. He was isolated and treated with the same level of protection as if the disease was confirmed.

Ebola tests came back negative and doctors are now saying that he is likely suffering from a respiratory infection. 

The hospital sent two adult ICU patients to NYU Langone over the weekend and staff are preparing to send two children in the ICU to the hospital, as well, WCBS-TV reports.

A spokesman said the transfers are meant to free up staff so that they can concentrate on caring for Dr Spencer, who is listed in serious conditions as he fights the deadly disease. 

Dr Spencer contracted Ebola while working for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea and did not begin experiencing symptoms until after he had returned home to New York.

Public health officials have stressed that Bellevue, America's oldest public hospital, is fully equipped to handle Ebola cases.

The hospital has 1,200 beds and boasts 1,800 doctors and a staff of 5,500 workers.  

Dr Spencer is the first American who is not being treated at one of three hospitals with special infectious disease isolation units. 

Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in America, was treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and later died. The two nurses he infected were transferred to specialized hospitals for treatment and both have since recovered. 

Seven Americans have been treated for Ebola so far and all have now recovered from the disease. Five were treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Two were treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln and nurse Nina Pham was treated at National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
