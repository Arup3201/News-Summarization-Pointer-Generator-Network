Chris Christie narrowly leads the pack of potential Republican presidential candidates in a poll of New Hampshire residents released Friday, but Mitt Romney crushes the competition when his name is added to the field.

Christie, the cantankerous and controversial New Jersey governor, emerged as the most polarizing name on a list of 13 politicians presented during a phone poll between June 19 and July 1.

While 46 per cent of New Hampshire Republicans like him, another 36 per cent don't. And he topped the list when GOP respondents were asked who they definitely would not vote for.

But with 19 per cent support in a hypothetical presidential primary, Christie has emerged as the flavor-of-the-month front-runner.

Cheshire cat: Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, has campaigned in New Hampshire for U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown, drawing fans wearing his 2012 campaign t-shirts

Its Mitt: Romney emerged as the dominant force in New Hampshire GOP politics on Friday, crushing the competition in a hypothetical 2016 presidential primary matchup

All 13 potential Republican candidates in the WMUR/Granite State Poll have either fed speculation about their plans for 2016 or allowed pundits to place their names in contention.

But former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has said he will not run for president again, comes out far ahead when his name is added to the mix – posting numbers nearly as dominant as Hillary Clinton's in the Democratic field.

If he were to get into the race today, polling data show, he would lead Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul by a 39-7 margin.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would trail behind with 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 per cent, respectively.

'Look, I'm not surprised that Romney is still well-liked in Hew Hampshire,' a GOP campaign consultant told MailOnline on Friday. 'He was governor right next door, and as President Obama becomes more and more unpopular there's a sense of buyer's remorse.'

'But ultimately, he's just going to suck the oxygen out of the room and that's not too helpful to the people who are actually going to run in 2016.'

Without Romney, the second tier reclaims some of that oxygen.

Following 
Christie's 19 per cent showing comes Paul with 14 per cent, Bush with 
11, Rubio and Huckabee tied at 8, and Cruz and Jindal with 5 percent – 
sharing that low perch with Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.

Ryan
 was Romney's ill-fated running mate in 2012, and has the distinction of
 being the most-liked potential White House hopeful in the New Hampshire
 field.

Second tier: Sens. Rand Paul (L) and Marco Rubio (C), and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) round out the main group of also-rans

Hey, girl: Rep. Paul Ryan, who shared the GOP ticket with Mitt Romney in 2012, is the candidate with the highest favorability ratings among New Hampshire Republicans

The affable budget hawk is liked by 55 per cent of surveyed Republicans, while just 18 per cent say they view him unfavorably. His net 37 per cent 'likeability' number is a stark contrast with Christie's 10 per cent.

The New Jersey governor and Republican Governors Association chairman has his work cut out for him, and has already started making the Granite State a regular stop on his political travel schedule.

'Buyer's remorse': As President Barack Obama's scandals swirl around him, some in New Hampshire have new enthusiasm for his 2012 opponent Mitt Romney

He made a fundraising trip to New Hampshire to support GOP gubernatorial candidate Walt Havenstein in June, just days after phone calls for the poll began. Christie will return for another fundraiser on July 31.

But his image has taken significant hits in the past 12 months because of a scandal related to senior staffers' alleged use of the famed George Washington Bridge to create traffic jams in a town whose Democratic mayor declined to endorse his re-election bid.

Romney has been in New Hampshire too, campaigning for U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown.

Brown trails Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen by 12 points in the latest poll, doubling an earlier margin. If Brown stumbles in November or fails to win his party's Senate primary, Romney will be seen as damaged goods with limited appeal.

And as the man who lost to President Barack Obama, insiders are keenly aware that he might repeat his failure if he ran again.

'It's that old definition of insanity, doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result,' the campaign operative cautioned.

The New Hampshire Republican Party declined to comment.

Democrats in the New Hampshire poll put former first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton far ahead of anyone else, but her numbers are beginning to fade.

In January a whopping 74 per cent of Democrats polled in New Hampshire said they planned to vote for her in the first-in-the-nation primary.

Now that figure is down to 59 per cent, with Vice President Joe Biden coming in a distant second at 14 per cent, followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 8 per cent.

Bringing up the rear were Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (5 per cent), New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  (3 per cent), and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia (1 per cent).
