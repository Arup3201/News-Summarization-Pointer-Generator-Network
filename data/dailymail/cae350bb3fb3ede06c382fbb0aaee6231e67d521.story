With her possessions crammed into a single red bag, a Romanian woman watches as police prepare to search her and her fellow beggars.

This is the sight greeting dignitaries arriving in one of London’s wealthiest streets for the Olympics.

Up to 40 beggars have made Park Lane their home, transforming a stretch of the central reservation into a gambling den and doss house.

Unwelcome guests: Some of the 50 Romanian beggars evicted from Marble Arch last Month gambling in Park Lane after setting up a new camp in the exclusive road's central reservation

Growing problem: Officers search the Romanians as police and the council battle to keep a steady influx of migrant pickpockets and prostitutes in check

According The Evening Standard, locals said the gang had been sleeping in cardboard boxes in a subway which runs under the central reservation until the midpoint entryway was barred shut last week.

Coachloads of penniless pickpockets and prostitutes are arriving in the capital every day, many already armed with maps directing them to the best patches, which they have been ordered to defend from rivals.

Yesterday, police made attempts to search the beggars – while just a few yards away out of sight some of the group were urinating in the street.

And this morning, two police vans were parked in Marble Arch, while a small group of six Eastern Europeans sat nearby with several large black bags.

A British homeless man said it had become too dangerous to sleep out in central London because of Romanian gangs roaming around at night thieving at knifepoint.

Disgusting: The group regularly urinate in the street, in full view of the area's top restaurants and hotels

Ongoing issue: Westminster Council has held a summit meeting of local agencies including the Foreign Office and representatives of the Romanian Embassy to discuss the problem

Keeping an eye out: Police vans parked outside Marble Arch, around 50 yards from Park Lane, as officers monitor the homeless group

Westminster Council has held a summit meeting of local agencies including the Foreign Office and representatives of the Romanian Embassy to discuss the problem.

It repatriated 18 people to Romania recently, but only after the coach company insisted on them being given showers and new clothes before they boarded a bus.

Westminster councillor Nickie Aiken said: 'These people are dispersing but they are not going away. They are either camping in Park Lane or moving into South Mayfair and around Oxford Street.

'The police and council are doing all we can about this but the taxpayers are picking up the bill, mainly the cost of cleansing because they have no toilets.'

Last night, a group of around 20 - split between elderly women with walking sticks and headscarves and men in their 30s with hooded jackets and mobile phones - sat together on a tatty blanket playing dice for piles of £1 coins in the dual carriageway’s central reservation.

Push-along suitcases, beer bottles and carrier bags littered the grass yards from the prestige car dealerships, Speakers’ Corner and some of the capital’s best-known hotels.

'Police here earlier, no trouble, no problems,' said one man in his 20s in broken English, before adding: 'No camera.'

Transient problem: Police move members of the group, clutching bin bags, from the entrance of Marble Arch station

An elderly woman broke away from the group to pull down her tights and relieve herself against a fence.

'It’s disgusting,' said Brian Portman, 46, from New Zealand, waiting to board an open-top bus tour. 'It’s definitely not what you expect to see in London. It’s like something from the Third World,' he told the Standard.

Local trader Said Ali, of Park Lane News, said: 'There’s always a group of them out there, at night I’ve seen more than 50. They go out in the day begging for money and all come back to sleep in the bushes.

'Sometimes they come in here asking to buy drinks. They always pay in change - 5ps and 10ps they’ve collected through the day. It’s not nice seeing them out there with their bags, sleeping everywhere, it doesn’t give a good impression.'

Luiia Rapuano, a hairdresser at the upscale Kakan Altay salon, said: 'Some of our clients use the subway and there were piles of cardboard boxes down there where they’d been sleeping. It was like a cardboard city in the middle of posh Mayfair.

'I use the subway to go home at night and I was a little bit scared. It was awful.

The council have taken all the boxes away now, so they’re sleeping rough in the bushes. We need Boris to come up here and sort it out.'

Under siege: The beggars have only moved around 50 yards from Marble Arch (above), where they were evicted from last month as council workers fight to control an influx of crime gangs ahead of the Olympics

Rough deal for London: Coachloads of penniless pickpockets and prostitutes are arriving in the capital every day, many already armed with maps directing them to the best patches, which they have been ordered to defend from rivals

Sarah Greene, who has manned an ice cream booth opposite for more than 20 years, said: 'It’s disgusting. I’ve seen men from the council come down to move them on, but as soon as they leave they come back again. When you walk past the subway it stinks of urine.'

The council has asked the Foreign Office and the Romanian government for a publicity campaign in Romania to try to deter people from coming.

Ms Aiken said: 'This is getting worse because of the Olympics, I worry that people are being duped into thinking there are jobs here.'

A Met Police spokesperson said: 'Westminster Police are working alongside Westminster City Council, the UK Border Agency and partner agencies to address these issues.

'The local Safer Neighbourhoods Team and Westminster Council will be working together to prevent any crime and anti-social behaviour linked to the recent influx of homeless people in Marble Arch.'

A Westminster City Council spokesperson added: 'There is continued dialogue going on with outreach teams to try and get them to move on.

'They try to suggest that they return home and ask them what they are doing and how they are earning money.

'It is an ongoing issue and one which we think will require various strategies to tackle, including talking with the groups directly and monitoring chartered coaches arriving in London from Romania.'
