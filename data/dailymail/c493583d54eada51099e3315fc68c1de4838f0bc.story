This is the moment a drunken burglar was caught on camera by a home-owner as he fled over a garden fence.

Darren Thomas, 38, tried to break in through the kitchen window of a property just around the corner from his own house in Ronkswood, Worcester.

But he fled after he was spotted by 27-year-old owner Chris Hancock, who had just returned home.

The teacher ran outside and snapped Thomas as he climbed over a fence, before sprinting off across neighbouring gardens.

He then showed the photo to police, who recognised the burglar and arrested him later that day.

Thomas admitted attempted burglary and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty at Worcester Magistrates' Court on Friday.

But he escaped jail after magistrates sentenced him to five months in prison, suspended for two years.

Sentencing Thomas, Judge Nigel Cadbury told him: 'If you had already broken in and were caught inside the house by the householder with that record, you would be going to prison immediately.'

Clare Linehan, prosecuting, said Thomas, who appeared at court on crutches, had been spotted by Mr Hancock trying to remove the beading from the kitchen window on April 28 this year.

'The householder came home and there was a confrontation, albeit through a window,' she said.

'[He] had come back to let the dog out. As he walked into the kitchen he saw a man at the window and he realised he was trying to break in to his property.'

She added that when Thomas was confronted by police later that day, he had resisted arrest, saying: 'He started to resist, pulling his arms away, and tried to get back into his home address.'

Judith Kenney, defending, told the court that Thomas had turned to drink after he lost his job as an auditor and his 18-year marriage had collapsed.

'On the defendant’s own admission he was trying to get the beading off the window with a multi-tool for a child’s bike when having been spotted, he garden hopped to get away,' she said.

'He admitted this offence from the word go in the police station. He was ashamed and mortified by what he had done.

She added: 'He was only not co-operative [with the arrest] because his children had been upset.'

Speaking outside court, Mr Hancock said he had acted out of instinct, adding: 'Luckily, the picture helped police find him.'

In addition to his suspended sentence, Thomas was placed 
under supervision for two years, ordered to undergo alcohol treatment 
for 12 months and placed on an electronic curfew between 7pm and 7am.

He was also ordered to pay £100 compensation to his victim and an £80 victim surcharge.
