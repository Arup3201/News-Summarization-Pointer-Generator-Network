If only dogs could talk - Connor would have endless tales about his wild adventure fending for himself in the harsh Australian outback over the past seven months.

Although Haydn Roeger, his partner Sally and sons Henry,7, and Samuel ,5, never gave up hope of finding their beloved pooch - discovering that Connor was alive and would finally be a part of their family again is still sinking in for the elated family.

The cute canine went missing near the family's hobby farm in Moodiarrup, about 250km south of Perth in June last year.

Haydn Roeger was over the moon to have his beloved pet back home again

Haydn momentarily stopped the ute on the way back to the family home in Perth and was unaware that Connor somehow manged to come free of his harness that he was regularly tied up to on the back of the vehicle.

'He must have got spooked - it's weird I don't know why he did what he did,' Sally told Daily Mail Australia.

'Haydn even went back and camped overnight at the spot we lost him.'

On their trips down to the farm over the past seven months, the two boys were told to look out for their precious pet because you 'just never know'.

'We never entertained the idea that he would have died,' Sally said. 

'He is so strong and has such a beautiful temperament and he loves his family more than anything in the world.'

Connor had lost nine kilos and his paws and ears were covered in grass seed wounds

Home sweet home: Connor's first night back in his comfy beanbag

A phone call at about 10.30pm last Saturday proved the loyalty and determination of Connor when farmers Hayden and Robyn Lubke found him on their 5,000 acre property, near Darkan, about 40km north from where he went missing.

'At first they thought it was a feral pig but luckily they went down to have a look and he took off into the bush but their Kelpie circled him like a sheep.'

Hadyn and Sally told their sons that they had to pick up some sheep that had escaped from their farm but got the most the most unexpected surprise when they got to their destinaton.

'When Sam walked towards the back of the ute he stopped still and said "Mum that looks like Connor: and I said "Sam, it is Connor" and then I burst into tears - the boys were delighted', Sally said.

'Connor jumped straight off the ute and ran over to us and we brought along his doggy wife Molly for cuddles and kisses as well.

'Sam said "my best friend is home - I love him and missed him so much".'

Connor may have lost nine kilos and his paws and ears were covered in grass seed wounds but his tail has not stopped wagging since he got home.

'It's like he never left - it's weird - he's back on duty again patrolling around the pool while the kids are swimming,' Sally said. 

'It's a just nice story of a family that loves their dog and a dog that loves their family.' 

It's like Connor has never left the Roeger family home in Perth, Western Australia
