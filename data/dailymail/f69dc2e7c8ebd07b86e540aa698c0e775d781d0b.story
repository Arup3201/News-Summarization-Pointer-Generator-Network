After years of yo-yo dieting, Stella Sydee’s weight had spiralled out of control.

She suffered from asthma, joint pain and depression and her self-confidence had hit rock bottom.

Deciding enough was enough, Stella lost over 8st, rebuilding her self-confidence in the process. And she's now eager to share her dieting and fitness tips to help others reach their own weight loss goals.

Stella, 42, explains: ‘My weight was affecting every aspect of my life. I was a bubbly outgoing person, but my weight gain was sapping my confidence and I no longer enjoyed going out and socialising. I would stay at home instead and slept a lot during the day.

‘Although I didn’t realise it at the time, food was becoming a secret addiction and I would comfort eat on a daily basis, relying on food to make me happy.

'I knew my weight was out of control, as I had reached nearly 17st, but I didn’t know how I could gain control and make a long term change.

‘My health was also becoming a concern, I was depressed and my joints were beginning to ache. My asthma had also worsened and breathing was often difficult.’

Managing to shed an initial 2st through exercise and changes to her diet, Stella found her weight loss plateaued.

Stella's size was effecting her health and she suffered from asthma, joint pain and depression

She decided to join a slimming club to give her more structure and support.

‘Despite my weight, I still exercised with my friend who is a fitness instructor. We went on walks together but I still wasn’t losing enough.

I had tried so many different diets and had some success prior to LighterLlife, losing almost 2st, but with more than 5st still to lose I became discouraged and the comfort eating and weight gain returned.

‘This was when my friend recommended LighterLife as the counselling sessions would help me learn about the behaviour leading to the comfort eating and equip me with the tools to keep the weight off for the rest of my life.

After an initial loss of 2st Stella's weight loss stalled until she joined Lighter Life and started counseling and a food replacement diet to combat her over eating

With her weight at 15st 3lbs, she 
attended counsellor Sharon Hamilton’s classes in Dartford. She undertook
 the Total programme, where ordinary eating is replaced by four 
specially-formulated food packs per day, alongside weekly counselling 
sessions to assess the psychological issues behind over-eating and 
ensure a permanent lifestyle change.

‘It
 was a turning point in my life. It has taken time, but now after losing
 5st and adopting a healthier lifestyle, I have re-educated my way of 
thinking around food, trimmed myself down to a size 8-10 and now weigh a
 steady 9st.

'I feel fit, 
healthy and confident about myself and I am so much more excited for 
life. My bubbly personality has returned and I love socialising with 
friends and family and no longer take a back seat.

‘My
 family and friends have been amazed by my weight loss journey and I 
love it when I see people who I haven’t seen for a while as they truly 
don’t recognise me! I love their reactions when they realise who I am, 
they are often lost for words! My husband, two sons and my parents have 
been particularly supportive throughout this time and enjoy the new more
 active me.

Stella now loves socializing again and says her old confidence has returned once again

‘Last time we visited Centre Parcs, I went on the zip wire, in the pool and the water rapids. This was something I would never have done before I lost the weight and it felt great to be able to get involved in fun activities with my family.

‘My love for fashion is something that I can now enjoy and l look forward to shopping for new clothes.

'Before I lost weight I hated clothes shopping and would only buy long tops that covered my body which I wore with jeans or leggings but now I love dressing up in skirts or dresses and heels.

'Exercise and fitness has also become a passion of mine, my gym is now like my second home.

‘Losing the weight and changing my thinking about myself and given me the confidence to start working again. I currently work part-time for an elderly people charity, visiting them in their homes. It is extremely rewarding and has also helped rebuild my confidence.

‘As I feel passionate about helping others, I am also studying Nutrition, CBT and NLP building a career in Weight Management. I want to help other people who struggle with issues around food and self confidence to experience the success I never dreamed possible, equipping them with not only sound nutritional advice but with the essential psychological tools to enable long term change in their lives.’
