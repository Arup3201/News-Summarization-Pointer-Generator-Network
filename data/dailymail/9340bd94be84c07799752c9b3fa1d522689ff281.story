A mother has opened up about the heartbreak of telling her nine-year-old child he had a rare form of prostate cancer.

Zona Storie from Shawnee, Oklahoma, told ABC News that she found it even more difficult to relay the news to her son, Trevor, because both of his grandmothers had died from cancer and therefore he associated the disease with death.

'When we told him what he had, he just broke down because he just assumed he wasn't going to make it,' she recalled.

Close bond: Zona Storie from Shawnee, Oklahoma, has opened up about the heartbreak of telling her nine-year-old child, Trevor, he had a rare form of prostate cancer

Doctors at OU Medical Center in Oklahoma discovered Trevor had Stage 3 rhabdomyosarcoma in mid-December after he was admitted with sickness, abdominal pain and difficulty using the bathroom.

His parents were advised by a hospital social worker about how best to relay the news.

'Once they told us, we were struggling about how we were going to tell him,' Mrs Storie said.

After she and her husband, Shane, told Trevor about his illness doctors reassured the third grader that it was curable and what the next steps would be.

'They explained to him what they were 
going to do and that it was curable . .
 . it actually made a huge difference'

'They explained to him what they were going to do and how they were going to do it and that it was curable . . . it actually made a huge difference,' Mrs Storie said.

Back at home, she also had to reassure her two teenage children, daughter Baylee,17, and son Zane, 14, that their brother would be OK.

'All they knew was that cancer is bad,' she said.

Doctors immediately performed surgery to remove the tumor in Trevor's prostate and insert a urinary catheter.

He is currently undergoing 42 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which has already caused his hair to fall out.

Mrs Storie told KFOR TV that doctors have promised a 'full recovery' but in the meantime he must take it easy.

'There’s no football, there’s no baseball, there’s no dirt bikes, there’s no trampolines,' she said. 'All there is, is just trips to the doctor.'

'Be very honest with the child about 
what's happening with them and that all these people surrounding them are 
going to work together to try to cure them'

Both
 of Trevor's grandmothers died of cancer - pancreatic and of the breast -
 so when he was told about his diagnosis on December 16 2013 he found it
 difficult to process.

Janna Shelby, a social worker in the oncology department at UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland says there are a few basic principles when breaking 'bad news' to children.

'Be very honest with the child about what's happening with them,' she told ABC News. 'We always recommend honesty and speaking in the child's language in terms of their development level.

'To let them know that they're sick and that all these people surrounding them are going to work together to try to cure them to help them get better.'

All change: Trevor will not be able to play football or ride his dirt bike for the next 42 weeks as he undergoes intense chemotherapy and radiation treatment

Devastated: Trevor's mother, Zona, has set up a fundraising page on Facebook in a bid to pay for the medical bills not covered by insurance - she lost her mother to pancreatic cancer

Rhabdomyosarcoma
 is a cancer of the muscles that typically affects young
children. Only a few hundred new cases in the U.S. reported each year, according to MedLine Plus.

It often appears around the bladder, vagina or - in Trevor's case - the prostate.

Although
 it was often considered terminal decades ago, it can now be 
treated with a mix of chemotherapy and organ-sparing surgery.

'Despite this diagnosis, Trevor has 
continued to wear a smile and has proven to be a hero already, that is 
something the cancer will never take from him'

While the disease is a lot more common in older men, Trevor's parents says his rare cancer has made him quite the celebrity.

'Everybody knows us. Let’s put it that way,' mother-of-three Mrs Storie told KFOR TV.

'He’s the kid with prostate cancer because it must be that rare.'

In the meantime, she and her husband Shane say they’ll do everything they can to make him feel as normal as possible.

Mr Storie recently shaved his own head in support of his son.

With medical bills expected to be outrageous, the Stories have launched a fundraising effort via Facebook and have been holding benefits in their local area.

Mrs
 Storie, who is currently on unpaid leave from work so she can care for 
her son, concluded on Facebook: 'Despite this diagnosis, Trevor has 
continued to wear a smile and has proven to be a hero already, that is 
something the cancer will never take from him.'
