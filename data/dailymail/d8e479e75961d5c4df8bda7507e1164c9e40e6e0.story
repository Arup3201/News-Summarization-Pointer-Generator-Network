Assault: Fletcher began binge drinking to cope with emotional distress, magistrates were told

A transgender woman attacked a paramedic with a shampoo bottle in an unprovoked mid-afternoon assault.

Leyla Fletcher, 36, Standing trial as Kevin Fletcher, struck the worker on the head before kicking him after being found stricken in Manchester city centre.

Ambulance service bosses have now slammed her sentence after she escaped with a three year conditional discharge.

Fletcher has been attempting to undergo gender reassignment surgery for the last 12 years, a court heard.

However after several failed attempts she began binge drinking to cope with the emotional distress, magistrates were told.

The emergency services were called to St Mary's Parsonage in the city centre at around 1pm on a Thursday afternoon earlier this month to reports a woman was having a fit.

They found Fletcher on the floor though after checking her over they found she wasn't fitting, Tess Kenyon, prosecuting said.

They then put her in a wheelchair and put her into the ambulance which is where she launched the attack on paramedic Philip Ogden.

She threw a bottle of shampoo she had bought earlier that day at him, hitting him on the head, before kicking out and hitting him in the shin.

Police were called and she was arrested. She admitted to officers that she had been drinking red wine and couldn't remember much about the incident.

Fletcher, of Salford, pleaded guilty to assault at Manchester Magistrates court.

Lyndsey Brown, defending, said Mitchell had been the victim of a brutal attack herself, as well as abuse from people living near her, and her mother had disowned her.

She said: 'I hope you could take the view that this was a one-off and that the defendant will never be before the court again.

'It has been a hard period of time and she has drank to excess.

'But things are now moving, her gender reassignment has started. It's in the early stages and there are many years ahead.'

Slammed: An ambulance official said: 'The Trust is extremely disappointed with the sentence given to the perpetrator in this instance'

She was handed a conditional discharge by magistrates, meaning she will not be punished unless she commits any more offences, despite having a previous conviction for assault.

Chairman of the bench Terri Farrow said: 'Normally this offence would carry a community order.

'However given your personal difficulties and everything you have been through and are still to go through, we are going to impose a conditional discharge.'

She was also ordered to pay £200 compensation to her victim, as well as £85 costs and a £25 victim surcharge.

Speaking after the hearing, Director of Emergency Service for North West Ambulance Service, Derek Cartwright said: 'The Trust is extremely disappointed with the sentence given to the perpetrator in this instance.

'Our message is that we will always push for those who assault crews to receive the maximum sentence allowed.

'It's unfortunate that hasn't happened in this case.'
