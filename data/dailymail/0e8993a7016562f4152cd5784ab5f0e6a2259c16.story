Group C: Japan v Greece

Venue: Estadio das Dunas, Natal

Kick-off: 11pm (7pm, Brazil time)

TV coverage: BBC1, from 10.35pm

Odds: Japan 21/20, Draw 9/4, Greece 2/1

VIDEO Team Profile: Japan  

Star man: Manchester United's Shinji Kagawa (centre) is a key player for Japan

Experienced: Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni

One to watch: Makoto Hasebe (Japan)

The captain plays a key role for Japan in a holding position. It is his discipline and ability to break up the moves of their opponents that provides the platform for his side’s attacks, which will be key to grant attacking freedom to the likes of Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa.

Key clash: Atsuto Uchida vs Georgios Samaras

Samaras proved a handful down the left hand side for Greece in their Group C opener and will look to be a threat again when faced with skilled right back Atsuto Uchida. The Schalke man will need to keep an eye on the 6ft 4in targetman and has to make sure he does not drift into the gap between centre back and right back as he so often did against the Colombians.

History lesson

Their only previous meeting ended in a 1-0 win for Japan.
