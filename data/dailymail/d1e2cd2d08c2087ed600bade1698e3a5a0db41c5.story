A 41-year-old fireman committed suicide by lying down in traffic just four days after he was probed for alleged domestic assault, officials said.

Daniel Armitage, a fireman in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who was married with three children, was run over by at least three cars on I-696 on Thursday.

It seemed at first he was trying to change a flat tyre on his BMW SUV - but police found the tyre was not flat and the jack was still in the boot.

Fireman: Daniel Armitage, 41, committed suicide by lying down in traffic just four days after he was probed for alleged domestic assault, officials said

Mr Armitage was being investigated for domestic assault on New Year’s Day and that probe is still going on, reported the Ann Arbor Journal.

He pulled over at 6:30am last Thursday on I-696 and the spare tyre was placed next to his white SUV, reported the Detroit Free Press.

But investigators found the tyre still on the SUV had enough pressure to drive on it, although two lug nuts had been removed.

However none of the other lug nuts were loosened, which was strange as this is usually done to all of them on a tyre  when a car is jacked up.

Witnesses said he was lying down in the right lane of traffic and his SUV was parked with its lights flashing, reported the Detroit Free Press.

A father and his two children were hurt when their vehicle was forced into the central reservation. The road was closed for more than six hours.

Police will not release details of the alleged domestic abuse incident until their investigation of Mr Armitage’s death is complete.

A funeral is being held for Mr Armitage, of Bloomfield Township, Michigan, on Tuesday at St Hugo of the Hills Church in Bloomfield Hills.

Mr Armitage had been a fireman in Ann Arbor, a city around 45 miles west of Detroit, for almost 17 years. He was off-duty at the time of his death.

His wife was hospitalised last week at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, but there has been no update on her condition.
