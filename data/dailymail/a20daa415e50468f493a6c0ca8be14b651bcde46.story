Interior Secretary Sally Jewell is touring Jamestown, Virginia and says it's clear that rising seas are taking a toll on America's first permanent European settlement.

Jewell trekked and bused her way Thursday through the 1,600-acre island in Virginia's Tidewater region.

Guided by National Park Service rangers, Jewell saw sections of the island that now lie beneath the James River and heard of the devastation in 2003, when Hurricane Isabel raked the low-lying landscape.

In an interview with The Associated Press between stops, Jewell called Jamestown a 'hot spot' for climate change.

She says climate change is threatening to wash away the nation's history here.

Jamestown was founded in 1607.

A report released by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in May found that Jamestown is just one of 30 at-risk locations that might be washed away by climate change.

'Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, increased flooding, heavy rains and more frequent large wildfires are damaging archaeological resources, historic buildings and cultural landscapes across the nation,' says the report, National Landmarks at Risk.

USA Today reports that according to the USC report, Jamestown will be underwater by the end of the century.

Sea levels have risen 1-2 feet across areas of the east and the Gulf Coats.

USA Today reports that by 2100 global sea levels will be up anywhere from 1 to 3 feet.

Other notable at risk historic sites are The Kennedy Space Center, the site of the Apollo Launch, Cape Canveral, and national parks including Mesa Verde, Bandelier, Cape Hatteras and the Everglades.

On the West Coast climate change threatens to increase the risk of wildfires especially in the Southwest, home to many archeological artifacts.

Wildfires are often followed by flooding.
