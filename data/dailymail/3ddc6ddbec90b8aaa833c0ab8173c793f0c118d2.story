It's the sort of challenge that most people would want to take their time over.

But for one daredevil, speed was the essence when it came to  performing a tightrope walk between two hot air balloons.

Suspended some 108 feet above the ground, Aisikaier Wubulikasimu tiptoed across a steel beam that measured just two inches wide.

The 40-year-old Uighur acrobat certainly had his head in the clouds as he calmly trod the 59m - or 180ft - long tightrope.

Whereas most would spend a painstakingly slow time to cross the beam, Wubulikasimu was anxious to reach the other side as quickly as possible so he could smash a Guinness World Record.

The flexible gymnast has previous broken two Guinness World Record for the fastest tightrope walk over 100 meters in 2009 and the steepest tightrope walk in 2011.

And he added another record to his name 
after finishing his high-wire walk between two hot-air balloons in 38.35
seconds, breaking the Guinness record, the NY Daily News reported.

Nearly there: Aisikaier, a tightrope walker in China, walked over an 18-meter-long round girder 5cm in diameter between two hot air balloons

He was certified by Guinness Record officials at the scene for his adventurous escapade

He carried out his high-flying feat above China's Naigu Stone Forest in Yunnan.

Aisikaier, who's a sixth-generation tightrope walker from China's Xinjiang, is a daredevil.

He nearly experienced death last July after, while blindfolded, he fell off a more than 650-foot high tightrope during a performance of walking over a 2,300-foot wire in Hunan Province last July. 

The dazzling forest was listed as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site in 2007, and the 30-square-kilometer Naigu scenic area is known as a natural museum of karst landforms, that formed about 270 million years ago.

The word naigu means 'ancient and black' in the language of the Yi ethnic group, a fitting description of the mass of blackish limestone.

The name Yunnan refers to 'the place south of the colorful clouds' and the area is the most southwest province of China.
