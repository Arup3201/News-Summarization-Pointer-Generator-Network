Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured outside Number 10 today, is due to deliver his long-awaited speech on Europe tomorrow

Dozens of Tory MPs are to launch a campaign to keep Britain in the European Union, fearing ties with Brussels could be severed almost by accident.

David Cameron will use his long-awaited speech on Europe to warn Britain could ‘drift towards the exit’ without major reforms before pledging a referendum on membership of the EU.

More than 30 pro-European Conservatives are preparing to back the idea of a full in/out referendum, believing the anti-EU faction of the party has dominated the debate so far.

The Prime Minister has made clear he wants the UK to remain in the EU only if significant powers can be returned from Brussels.

In his speech in London tomorrow he will argue that major changes to the structure of Europe among Eurozone countries present an opportunity for Britain to renegotiate its relationship.

Mr Cameron had been due to deliver the speech in Amsterdam last Friday, but called it off with hours to go to focus on the Algerian hostage crisis.

The PM will promise to seek ‘fresh consent’ from the British people on a new settlement with Europe in a referendum, although to date he has stopped short of promising a straight in/out choice fearing Britain could vote to leave.

In a surprise poll yesterday it emerged that more people would now vote to stay that would back withdrawal.

Forty per cent of people said they would vote to remain while 34 per cent would vote to leave, according to the YouGov poll carried out on January 17 and 18. Five per cent said they would not vote and 20 per cent said they did not know.

The result has buoyed Tories who consider themselves ‘euro realists’ who believe Britain should remain in the EU.

Tory MP Laura Sandys said that for too long pro-Europeans in the party had been afraid to speak out publicly.

She
told MailOnline: ‘It has been an issue that not would dare speak its 
name in the Conservative party. Now things are changing.

‘There will be a lot of varying and surprising views right across the board.’

She warns against ‘Odd Man Out diplomacy’ and a referendum on staying in the EU can be won.

Policing minister Damian Green last 
year dismissed as a ‘fantasy’ the idea that Britain could remain in the 
common market but outside the EU. He is expected to play a leading role 
in the pro-European campaign.

By
embracing the idea of a referendum and putting forward a positive 
message for Britain staying in the EU, the co-ordinators of the campaign
want to play down recent warnings from Lord Heseltine that a referendum
was a ‘gamble’.

In the Commons today Foreign Secretary William Hague was of changing his mind over holding an in/out referendum.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander asked: 'If he believes that an immediate in-out referendum will cause uncertainty, why would an in-out referendum many years from now not cause uncertainty?'

But Mr Hague hit back arguing that: 'No minds change more often on this subject than on the front bench opposite.'

Mr Cameron's much-hyped speech was first promised in July last year, after he used a newspaper article to admit: 'For me the two words “Europe” and “referendum” can go together.'

He was due to deliver the speech first in the summer, then the autumn, before admitting in December that he was taking a 'tantric' approach to policy-making.

In-out question: For the first time since David Cameron became PM more people would vote to stay in the EU than leave, according to a series of opinion polls by YouGov

Extracts released last week showed that he will use the speech to warn EU leaders that Britain could leave the 27-nation bloc if three key concerns are not resolved.

But Downing Street has declined to comment on weekend press reports that he will announce an in/out referendum to be held after the 2015 general election, but rule out legislation during this parliament.

Lib Dem president Tim Farron today insisted his party would take a more constructive approach to Europe than the Tories.

'It is important that we clarify we’re the party in coalition that believes in a sane, mature, collegiate approach to our European colleagues rather than just throwing crockery at them,' he told BBC2's Daily Politics.
