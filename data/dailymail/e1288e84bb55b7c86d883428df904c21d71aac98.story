An Australia man has been forced to remain in an Indonesian jail cell after the delay of his court case over a fatal motorbike crash. 

Jake Drage's holiday ended in tragedy when he was arrested after his motorbike collided with another at an intersection which claimed the lift of a local woman in West Java, an Indonesian island, on June 30.

The 23-year-old has been held in custody since he was charged with reckless driving after a woman without a helmet was killed whilst riding on a motorcycle  driven her teenage daughter.

Prosecutors, who were due to make their sentencing recommendations to his trial on Tuesday, were not ready when Drage's case came up in a West Java court.

This caused his mother Tiena Drage to swear and burst into tears.

Ms Drage rushed to her son's side after the crash and has been supporting him since. 

While behind bars, Drage has converted to Islam and is attending weekly prayer recitals.

His lawyer Michael Hartono says they're disappointed with the one-week delay.

'The prosecutors should have conveyed their lack of preparedness (last week),' he said.

'Nevertheless we will respect the prosecution.

'Prosecutors argue Drage, a former personal trainer, was overtaking another vehicle before the crash at such a speed it made the collision unavoidable. 

If found guilty, the Perth man faces a maximum six years in jail and/or a maximum fine of $1,100. 

The husband of the victim last week told the court he didn't have any resentment over the crash and that he didn't want Drage charged.
