A Florida high school crowned the state’s first-ever homecoming king and queen with Down syndrome Friday night.

Travjuan ‘Bubba’ Hunter and Semone Adkins, both seniors, were crowned in an emotional Friday night ceremony on the football field just before West Orange High’s game against rival Cyprus Creek.

Fueled by the positive energy from the uplifting ceremony, West Orange won the game 56-7.

Royalty: Travjuan ¿Bubba¿ Hunter and Semone Adkins were named West Orange High School homecoming king and queen in an on-field ceremony last week

Up against traditional favorites such as football players and cheerleaders, the couple faced what many would consider long odds to take center stage.

But they won, and were celebrated in grand style.

Shown in local media footage riding to the field in the tops of open convertibles, the two students were treated like royalty and cheered on by many, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

‘We love you, Bubba!’ A group of girls screeched as he waved to the crowd during the homecoming parade.

‘Semone, you look beautiful!!’ Many people shouted as she waved on.

Cheers came from friends, family, cheerleaders, the girls lacrosse team, other students, town residents and even police officers, according to the paper.

This dream came true only because of the inclusive spirit of West Orange High School.

‘This didn't happen because we feel sorry for them or something,’ senior quarterback Hayden Griffits, 18, told the Sentinel. ‘Just the opposite, they really deserve it. I mean, homecoming is about bringing people together and having fun. And that's what they do.’

Bubba, as he is playfully called by classmates, is a popular in West Orange. He has many friends and spends most of his lunch period arm wrestling all challengers, including athletes and teachers – he usually wins, according to ClickOrlando.

‘Everybody in town knows Bubba, teacher’s aide Michelle Cavanzon told the Sentinel. ‘I swear he could run for mayor — and probably win.

Unknown to most students until just last week, according to the Sentinel, Ms Adkins wowed a packed auditorium during the homecoming couple nominees talent show.

Walking out on stage to Beyonce’s ‘Single Ladies,’ ‘he sometimes-shy, sweet young thing transformed into a strutting diva who extended her hand with all the attitude the song demanded,’ said the Sentinel.

The pinnacle of the performance came when Mr Hunter confidently walked out on stage, dropped to one knee and ‘put a ring on it.’ The auditorium went wild. Overcome with emotion, his mother burst into tears.

‘I cried the whole time,’ Janice Morgan, Mr Hunter's mom, told the Sentinel ‘I was so proud of him.’for over a decade, the would-be king and queen ended up on the ballot after a group of students wrote them in to the ballot.

Their fantasy became reality Friday night. Then, in an almost too god to be true turn of events, West Orange decimated their rivals and sent the whole town into a frenzy.

‘It was a dream come true, because I always knew that she was going to be something great in this world and this is just the beginning for us,’ Karen McNeil, Ms Adkins' mother, told ClickOrlando.
