A New Zealand man who was paid 'shopping money' to smuggle Ice into Bali may now have to pay the ultimate price after being arrested by Indonesian authorities.

Anthony Glen de Malmanche is facing the death penalty after allegedly smuggling 1.7kg of crystal methamphetamine into the popular holiday destination.

The investigation turned up limited information about the drug smuggling plan, but it appears De Malmanche was not going to make a killing out of the crime. 

'It was controlled from the outside. He hasn't said how much he's paid. He only admitted to be given shopping money,' Joni Lai, the deputy of Bali Provincial Police Drugs Squad, said.

De Malmanche had initially travelled to Hong Kong to see a woman he'd met online. From here he flew into Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport from Hong Kong with a suspicious-looking package.

The 52-year-old was due to meet the woman in Bali where they were planning to get married, according to media reports.

However, customs officers at the airport were alerted after De Malmanche began acting suspiciously while collecting his luggage on Monday morning.

'From X-ray examination, we found something suspicious in his green backpack,' the airport's head of customs office Budi Harjanto told reporters in Bali on Friday.

"After checking, we found a package with clear plastic wrapping, wrapped again with red plastic and brown duct tape. Inside, there's clear crystal weighed 1,709 gram total.'

A narcotics test found the crystal was methamphetamine, he said.

If found guilty De Malmanche could end up facing the death penalty

De Malmanche was charged under a section of Indonesia's narcotics law that carries a maximum penalty of death and a one billion rupiah ($A97,037) fine.

The NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it's aware of the reports from Bali but hasn't been contacted for consular assistance or advice.
