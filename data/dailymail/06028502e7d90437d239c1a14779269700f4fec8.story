A vintage Aston Martin which is thought to be the inspiration behind the gadget loaded car created for James Bond is up for sale.

The Aston Martin DB 2/4 is set to fetch as much as £250,000 when it goes under the hammer at a Coys auction at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on July 12.

The car was off the road and collecting dust when a father and son team bought it and restored it to its former glory.

It was during this restoration that the car’s links with 007 and Bond creator Ian Fleming came to light as the Aston Martin DB5, which features in the 1964 film Goldfinger was based on this very car.

This is due to the car’s special one-off features, which include reinforced steel bumpers, a heavy-duty anti-interference system and a driver’s seat connection for a two-way radio or homing device.

In addition there is also a device, which accurately computes time and distance in relation to a pre-selected average speed.

The current owner is thought to live in Deal, Kent, and is said to have bought the car last year from a man who explained its only claim to fame was that it had ‘once been driven in a rally’.

But when it was stripped down to be restored its links to James Bond and the spy’s creator Mr Fleming came to light.

It was found that the car once belonged to Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister, head of MI5 during the Second World War.

It is thought Mr Cunliffe-Lister used to visit Deal often with his wife to see Royal portrait painter Dennis Ramsay, who lived near Mr Fleming.

Coys managing partner Chris Routledge said: ‘The story around this car and its discovery is phenomenal.

‘It was owned by Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister, whose father was Lord Swinton, a close confidant of Winston Churchill and head of MI5 during the Second World War.

‘Moreover, the vehicle was regularly at Ian Fleming’s direct next-door neighbour in Kent, and indeed it was the next-door neighbour’s house which was also used as inspiration in the Bond novels, this time as Drax’s residence in the novel Moonraker.’

The Aston Martin DB 2/4 went into production from 1953 until 1957, and a total of 764 were produced.

The car came with a 2.9 litre engine, had a top speed of 118.5 mph and could go from 0-60 mph in 10.5 seconds.

At its peak, the DB2/4 was being produced at the rate of six or seven a week even though it was strictly a hand built car.
