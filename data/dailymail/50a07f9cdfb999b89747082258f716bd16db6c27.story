We’re still months away from being able to readily buy the Oculus Rift headset, but the latest prototype suggests the final version will be worth the wait.

The Facebook-owned firm has unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking.

Earlier this month, reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122).

The Crescent Bay model was unveiled by Oculus chief executive Brendan Iribe at the company’s Connect conference last weekend.

The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life.  

MailOnline has been using the latest version of the headset, the $350 (£215) DK2 version aimed at developers wanting to write VR apps.

At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps.

However, once you are immersed in a virtual world, doubts were quickly forgotten.

The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good.

While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world.

The number of demos and games is already growing by the day, and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space, all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves.

It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. 

Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices.

A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4.

By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution.

Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay’s features.

‘There are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer Rift, but Crescent Bay is truly the best virtual reality headset we've ever built,’ said Mr Iribe.

The price of the Oculus Rift consumer model, which does not have a release date yet, was revealed by Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell.

Speaking with Eurogamer, Mr Mitchell said the price could go up to $400 (£240), but that the price range was an estimate.

He also cautioned that nothing is set in stone.

'That could slide in either direction depending on scale, pre-orders, the components we end up using, [or] business negotiations,' he said.

Previously, Oculus VR said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $300 (£185).

Developers can currently buy protoype versions of the headset for $350 (£215).

A consumer model of the headset is expected to launch next year with price estimates ranging from $200 (£122) up to $400 (£240)

The firm also revealed earlier this month it has been working with Samsung on a mobile version of the headset, which will go on sale this year, but will not feature the advanced head tracking or high resolution display the Oculus version is expected to have.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when its $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg.

A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015.

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, which has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.
