Sarah Roemer has more to smile for than her recent wedding and pregnancy with Chad Michael Murray... She's also got a killer Monica Vinader diamond necklace to grin about!

While we have no word weather the lucky lady was gifted the item by her hot hubby, we want one of our own ASAP! Or at least something similar.

Kate Winslet, Claudia Schiffer and Cara Delevingne are all proud wearers of the Monica Vinader brand. Net-A-Porter even gifted their VIP clients with the bracelet version of this item this holiday season (see complete the look in our edit below).

We've also selected some similar slinky styles to be worn with your LBJ (little black jumpsuit). We especially love the Sarah Chloe large heartbeat necklace from Shopbop. Or get the spitting image with the fine bar necklace by Orelia from Topshop for only $24.00. Subtlety is so hot right now.

Roemer is best known for starring opposite Shia LaBeouf in the 2007 thriller Disturbia. The San Diego native has also appeared in the films Fired Up! (2009) and The Grudge 2 (2006).

Murray is best known for playing Lucas Scott on the WB's One Tree Hill.

'It was a large part of my life, so every day that goes by, at some point you'll see something that refers to it, or at least I will, in my life,' he  told Cosmopolitan.com.

'Playing the moral compass for that show, which is what Lucas was, was a great way for me to learn as an artist, and to start understanding emotions and understanding myself.' 

Recently Bush said on Watch What Happens Live that she didn't want to comment on her ex who she worked with on  One Tree Hill.

'My mother once said to me that if you don't have anything nice to say, not to say anything at all,' the beauty remarked.

Once Mr and Mrs Murray: Chad with his One Tree Hill co-star Sophia Bush in 2005; they divorced the next year

Bush, who now stars on Chicago PD, was married to the actor for only five months. 

The brunette then added, 'We were two stupid kids who had no business being in a relationship in the first place.' The 31-year-old actress also said, 'To all the other costars who've worked it out, more power to you.'

After Bush, Murray was engaged to Kenzie Dalton for seven years before splitting in September 2013.

Chad proposed to Kenzie with an oval-cut diamond ring when she was only 18-years-old and still a senior in high school.

It was another eight months before the Fruitvale Station actor's divorce from Bush was finalized.

Dalton, who played Cheerleader #1 on One Tree Hill, was first runner-up in the 2005 Miss North Carolina Teen USA pageant.

Murray had previously referred to the blonde actress - who is now 26-year-old - as 'my best friend.'

Chad made news in February for going on an extreme diet to lose weight for Other People's Children. 'I played a homeless heroin addict,' the New York native said of his role in the Liz Hinlein-directed drama.

'I lost 25 pounds for it, and I was really in a dark place for about a month. It was taking your work home with you. It's heavy.'

But he shed the pounds in a healthy way. 

'I wanted to do it organically in a healthy way, I really did. I didn't want to just cut down to water and crackers,' he explained. 'Every day I didn't consume anything that wasn't from God's green earth. Pretty much oatmeal, egg whites, salads, chicken, tuna - that's pretty much it. You find ways to dress it up and make it wonderful. After a week, you can't tell the difference. You actually look forward to egg whites - can't wait.'
