QPR defender Rio Ferdinand came close to hanging up his boots after leaving Manchester United at the end of last season.

The 35-year-old signed a one-year deal with QPR this summer and made his Premier League debut for Harry Redknapp's side in the 1-0 defeat to Hull on Saturday.

But Ferdinand, who took part in the ice bucket challenge at Loftus Road on Tuesday, admitted that if his former West Ham boss or another club from the capital hadn't come calling, he would've retired.

Happy chap: Ferdinand is delighted to be living back in London and playing for Harry Redknapp's side

Ferdinand told The Evening Standard: 'If I hadn't got the call from Harry, or I didn't have a team in London, I would have retired.

'I was really set on coming back to London for the sake of my kids being around their grandparents, cousins, uncle and aunties, so they could have real good memories of family life.'

Ferdinand, who spent 12 years at Old Trafford before being let go on a free transfer at the end of June, is happy that his career has allowed him to move back to London.

He added: 'I thought there might be an opportunity because there were rumours that he was going to buy me when he was at Spurs.

'That didn't happen. But the way it has panned out has been really good.'
