A jury deciding whether to sentence a convicted cop killer to death today saw a CCTV recording of the 31-year-old and a 29-year-old prison guard rendezvousing in the prison 'activity room'.

The CCTV video shows a two-minute incident between Ronell Wilson and Nancy Gonzalez, 29, which occurred at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center on July 15, 2012 in New York. 

The prison guard has pled guilty while on trial for the affair and 
possesses the full evidence of her crime: in March this year she gave 
birth to Ronell Wilson's son, whom she named Justus.

The affair was reportedly carried on between March and August of that year before Wilson was moved to solitary confinement.

According to the New York Daily News, an inmate called Kevin Johansen described an incident between the prisoner and his jailer, who reportedly often kissed and hugged one another.

Johansen said he saw Gonzalez holding open Wilson’s cell door while the other prisoners were locked down for a headcount.

'When she walked away I saw Mr. Wilson’s pants around his ankles and his genitals were exposed,' Johansen said.

Jurors also heard a recording of Wilson and his new girlfriend, also called Gonzalez, discussing her pleasuring him with her hand when his mother and sister were present at prison visiting hours.

Ronell Wilson's execution-style murder of two police officers in 2003 during a gun-buying sting operation led to the first federal death sentence in New York City for more than 50 years.

The sentence was overturned, and a new jury has now been assembled to decide Wilson's fate in the murders of Rodney Andrews, 36, and James Nemorin, 34.

According to The New York Times, Gonzalez admitted that the two had sex repeatedly, with the goal of having a child together. She explained her motivations to an inmate: 'Why not give him a child, as far as giving him some kind of hope?'

In a letter to another inmate, Wilson wrote, 'I just need a baby before thiz pigz try to take my life. I need to have something behinde.'

Mother: Nancy Gonzalez gave birth to her son Justus a few months ago, but she faces up to 15 years in prison for her affair with the convicted murderer

Gonzalez faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in the case against her. An inmate cannot legally consent to sex, so she is charged with sexual abuse of a person in custody.

According to The New York Times, after her affair with Wilson, Gonzalez took up with another inmate, who has been transferred to a different jail. The second inmate has offered to raise Wilson's baby as his own when he is released from prison.

Meanwhile, Ronell Wilson's sentencing trial continues. 

In Federal District Court in Brooklyn, lead prosecutor James G. McGovern told the packed courtroom what happened the night Andrews and Nemorin died.

On March 10, 2003 Wilson was a member of the notorious Bloods gang. He led James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews, detectives who were in Staten Island as part of a sting operation to buy illegal guns, in a car to a secluded neighborhood where he shot them in the back of the head.

He dumped the bodies from the car and drove off, covered in blood. It's not known if he murdered the officers because he knew they were police or for another reason.

According to prosecutors, he was trying to impress his fellow gang members, and planned to rob the men after he'd shot them.

Jurors have also been shown video of Wilson resisting prison guards and prosecutors are arguing he should be executed rather than face life in prison because he poses a threat even in jail.
