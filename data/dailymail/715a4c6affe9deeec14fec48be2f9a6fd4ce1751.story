A great-grandmother with a broken pelvis was left in a hospital toilet for more than an hour after staff forgot about her.

Annie Stanley was admitted to Northampton General Hospital following a fall at home earlier this month.

The 87-year-old widow said she was happy with her care until she was taken to the bathroom by a healthcare assistant on April 16.

Annie Stanley (pictured with her daughter, Gwen Greenaway), 87, was left for more than an hour in a hospital toilet after staff forgot she was there

When the pensioner - who suffers from claustrophobia - called to say she was ready to come out, nobody answered from the other side of the cubicle.

She then tried to pull on the emergency cord but it was broken - leaving her trapped in the toilet for an hour and 20 minutes.

Shockingly, the only way she escaped was to crawl 10ft to the door to unlock it herself despite being in excruciating pain.

She then shouted down the corridor for help before a member of staff finally heard her cries for help and found her stranded on the floor.

Mrs Stanley, who is now recovering at home in Hardingstone, Northamptonshire, said: ‘I was just waiting and waiting, pulling on the cord.

‘I thought “this can’t be working”. I got to the door and managed to unlock it, don’t ask me how I did it.

When she realised there was no one outside to help her, Mrs Stanley tried pulling the emergency cord but it was broken. Eventually, she crawled to the toilet door and opened it herself

‘Then I shouted down the corridor, but no-one could hear me.

‘I thought I would never get out. I thought nobody was coming for me.’

Now Mrs Stanley’s furious family are demanding to know why the member of staff didn’t check on her and left her alone for so long.

They also want the hospital to check its emergency cords on a daily basis rather than its current monthly inspections.

Her daughter, Julia Stanley, 67, said the consequences could have been much worse because her mother is claustrophobic and has a weak heart.

Even when she had unlocked the door, Mrs Stanley had to shout for help until someone came to find her

She added: ‘She lives alone, but this has really knocked her confidence.’

Staff only began to search for Mrs Stanley when her daughter began to worry where she was and at first they thought she was in the physiotherapy ward.

The family think the problem occurred because healthcare assistants on the ward are moved elsewhere in the hospital at 2pm and it was at this time that Mrs Stanley was in the bathroom.

Northampton General Hospital confirmed bosses are investigating and apologised to the family for the distress caused.

A spokesperson said: ‘We are very sorry to hear this report about Mrs Stanley’s care, and apologise for the distress this must have caused her.

'We are investigating this incident in detail but would like to assure the public that our staff care very deeply about the welfare of their patients and are extremely upset that this has happened.

'We will do everything in our power to ensure that something similar cannot happen again. We have also taken immediate action by implementing an audit programme to ensure that we can evidence regular testing of all emergency bells and call bells on a daily basis.

'We are determined to show that this incident is not indicative of the general standard of care at Northampton General Hospital.

'We are pleased to say that the Care Quality Commission, who recently carried out a thorough inspection of the hospital, made a point of noting that all our staff were judged to be caring, and we are very proud of that assessment. We continue to aim to provide the best possible care for our patients.'
