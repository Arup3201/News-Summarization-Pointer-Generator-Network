Thredbo landslide survivor Stuart Diver is mourning the loss of his wife Rosanna, who died at the weekend after a long battle with breast cancer.

Diver first came to prominence as a result of his remarkable survival when he was pulled out of the rubble on August 2 1997, some 65 hours after a landslide wrought havoc across Thredbo.

The disaster killed his then wife Sally and 17 others.

Stuart Diver and Rosanna Cossettini married on April 13, 2002 in a ceremony in the Snowy Mountains, she was 27 and he was 32.

Rosanna was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer just three weeks after their nuptials but went into remission. Sadly, the cancer had returned by July, 2013. She passed away on Saturday aged 40.

A short statement has been issued on behalf of the Diver family.

It simply reads: 'Stuart Diver and his extended family have requested privacy and respect for their loss at this time.'

In June last year, he told The Australian: 'Obviously, secondary breast cancers are not nice, there’s never a good outcome at the end.'

'But we’re doing everything we can, throwing everything at it, with Alessia being 3½, we’re trying to stay as positive as we can.'

Stuart Diver, 45, met his future wife, Rosanna Cossettini, two years after the Thredbo tragedy, which claimed his first wife’s life.

Rosanna Cossettini married Stuart Diver in April, 2002 at Coolringdon, near Cooma in south-west NSW. Mrs Diver passed away on Saturday after a lengthy battle with breast cancer

In his memoir Stuart wrote that: ‘I’d see Rosanna Cossettini now and then at the pub or walking around the village. We would chat but I never thought it would really amount to anything.'

'I figured she was way too good to go out with a rogue like me.’

His connection with Rosanna, he remembered, was truly special and she played a huge role in helping him heal from the trauma of his wife Sally’s death.

‘I had always believed that if it was right in your heart, then it was right,' he wrote of finding love after Sally's tragic passing.

'With Rosanna, I found myself loving again.'

At the time they ran the Snow Cloud Ski Lodge in the Woodridge section of Thredbo village together. 

In 2007, they set about building their dream home at Tura Beach on the South Coast.

Stuart wrote in his 2012 autobiography: ‘I knew in my heart that Sal would have wanted me to get on with my life.’

Three weeks after they married came the shattering diagnosis: Rosanna had advanced breast cancer.

However she recovered and, despite being told Rosanna could never carry a child, they welcomed their 'miracle baby’ daughter Alessia on September 3, 2011.

Rosanna was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in June 2013 which was reportedly followed by brain cancer.

At the time they ran the Snow Cloud Ski Lodge in the Woodridge section of Thredbo village together. 

The final sentences of Diver’s 2012 memoir is an ode to his wife: ‘Just look at what I now have … Alessia … Rosanna… my family… my career.

'Life’s good. All these things are evidence that something good can come out of something so bad.’ 

Friday's service will be held at a chapel in Thredbo and presided over by retired Salvation Army Lieutenant-Colonel Don Woodland.
