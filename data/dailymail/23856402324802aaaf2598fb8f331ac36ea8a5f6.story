Violent tackles by Burnley’s Ashley Barnes, a lack of protection for Eden Hazard and Jose Mourinho and Chelsea at war with the world. 

Southampton too had reason to complain after numerous penalty appeals were rejected (although they did it a little more quietly) and so referees are again back in the spotlight.

Sportsmail’s panel of experts, Jamie Redknapp, Martin Keown and former top referee Graham Poll, got together to discuss the fall-out. Head of Sport Lee Clayton asked the questions and listened in.

Q: Describe the current standard of refereeing in three words please, gents.

Poll: Inconsistent, inaccurate, outdated.

Keown: Not. Good. Enough. But I want to qualify that. Working as a co-commentator for the BBC, I understand their difficulty. I sometimes need two or three replays to see what has happened at high speed. Referees get one go. We should always try to remember that. What is most irritating, however, is when it happens right under their noses and they fail to see what is blindingly obvious.

Redknapp: You asked for three words, didn’t you? Honest. Average. Difficult.

Q. Do players and managers have to take their share of the blame too for causing this crisis?

Poll: Of course! It’s players more than managers. Refereeing has never been harder. Players exaggerate or even simulate contact and go down so easily that you struggle to believe what you are seeing. 

The way they roll around as if injured to get opponents in trouble is embarrassing to watch. Look at Branislav Ivanovic on Saturday after he was fouled by Ashley Barnes. 

Managers are understandably frustrated at some of the very poor decisions this season but they should try and help rather than attack.

Keown: There certainly needs to be more honesty. Players have introduced confusion by diving, so is it a foul, or not? Also, I’m not buying this ‘agenda’ claim from Mourinho. 

His latest outburst is a contrived attempt at cranking up the pressure on officials. There is no campaign against him. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had just as many reasons to be furious at the weekend, but he rises above it.

Redknapp: Is there really a crisis? Yes, there is diving, but get used to it, it is here to stay. Referees have made mistakes this weekend, but it’s only because of the attention applied by Jose Mourinho that we are having this debate. 

Look, the game is so quick, the rewards are so high and everyone is looking to gain an advantage, but behaviour towards referees isn’t any worse than when I was playing. Ask Graham!

Q: Eden Hazard is being kicked all over the place, so does Jose Mourinho have a point – are Chelsea being mistreated?

Redknapp: Hazard is so quick, of course he will be tripped and draw fouls. They are trips, kicks. There is nothing malicious behind it. And Chelsea are not being mistreated. Come on! They are a team of men, they have every trick in the book themselves.

Keown: My only concern with Hazard is this: Is he always being fouled, or is he buying the foul? He’s a brilliant footballer, I love it when he runs with the ball, but he is difficult to referee because he lightening quick. As for Chelsea… they are not mistreated, but they’ve had some poor calls. They can handle it.

Poll: Chelsea have not had the rub of the green, they’ve been unlucky. 

One could argue that Mourinho has brought this on himself with his constant bleating, but the main point must be that however the Chelsea manager behaves, referees must see each individual incident on its own merits and deal with it accordingly. 

As for Hazard, yes, he needs better protection (as does Diego Costa – to stop him taking the law into his own hands). They are outstanding footballers and we don’t want them kicked out of matches.

Q: Do big clubs try to bully and influence referees in a game-management style? Is this new?

Keown: The aggressive behaviour of players isn’t new, especially when they swarm around the referee. It’s unpalatable, but I remember George Graham once accusing us at Arsenal of ‘being too nice’ and to ‘get around the referee’ in a game against Manchester United. 

John Terry is the leader of the pack now. He runs faster towards a row involving the referee than he does in the rest of the game! He will argue his captain’s armband gives him the right to be there, but there is more to it than that. He leads the charge.

Redknapp: Sir Alex Ferguson demanded it of his teams too and then followed up by pursuing the referee down the tunnel. His Manchester United team were good at it, they won key decisions because of it. Mourinho is trying it now.

Poll: Players will try to influence referees, they always have. Referees have to be strong and they mustn’t be influenced by it. Fergie was the past master at it and was better at it than anyone around at the moment. He had a fear factor that Mourinho does not have.

Q: What can be done to help officials?

Poll: To solve any problem one must first accept that there is one. Select referees need better support, motivation and direction. Look at Atkinson on Saturday at Chelsea and you see a man fatigued. 

Just back from a trip to Germany where he focused on performing to get to France 2016 he looked tired and lethargic. After all it was ‘only Chelsea v Burnley’. He missed blatant offences which, if he were at his best, he would not have.

Redknapp: A radical change would be a referee in each half, like two umpires in hockey. But, before that, we must allow retrospective punishment, even if the FA have to overrule the officials.

 How can Ashley Barnes get away with his tackles at Chelsea on Saturday? If the referee misreads it or misunderstands what he has seen, he must have the chance to rectify it, or else he looks stupid and football looks stupid. They need help, so please let’s help them.

Keown: I agree with retrospective punishment, but they also need to help themselves. When a player has had a bad game, he goes straight on the training pitch and begins preparing for the next match and the chance to put it right. Referees can’t do that. I’d like to see the elite group refereeing midweek under-21 matches, which would give them the chance to restore confidence and also the opportunity to build relationships with the next generation of players. 

Poll believes Atkinson is fatigued and as a result is not at his best resulting in his recent below-par display

Q: Who are the three top referees in the country?

Poll: Mark Clattenburg, Michael Oliver and Mike Dean

Keown: I don’t disagree with Clattenburg and Oliver, but I’m struggling to find any more. Lee Probert is a good referee and took charge of the FA Cup Final last season, but was then injured and it coming back via the Championship. It’s a damning indictment that there aren’t more.

Redknapp: Michael Oliver is the best, no question. None of the others stand out – as I said to the first question, they are honest people, whose performances have been average this season and they have a difficult job. Let’s move on.
