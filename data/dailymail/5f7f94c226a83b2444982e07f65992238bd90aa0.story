Terry Thomas is one of a set of triplets who have been arrested after a student was shot with a stray bullet on Tuesday in Cleveland, Ohio

A set of triplets have been arrested after a schoolgirl was shot in the hip by a stray bullet during a stand-off between two vehicles.

Tyrese Thomas, Terry Thomas and Terrance Thomas, all 18, were involved in the shootout in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, police said.

One of the bullets hit Precious Marshall, 17, as she was walking home from softball practice around 5.10pm.

She said she was on her way to a prom dress fitting and was 'puzzled' when she heard gunfire. 

'I paused like "oh my god what am I going to do?" My mind was telling me run, but my body wasn't moving,' she told WKYC.com.

When Miss Marshall, who knew the suspects when she was younger, realised she had been hit she ran inside the nearby Glenville Recreation Center.

She was taken to the MetroHealth Medical Center but the bullet could not be removed as it was too close to her spine.

It is not known whether Miss Marshall will have to have an operation but she said she can no longer play softball. 

The triplets were arrested around five hours later.  

Miss Marshall, who is still on crutches, said she thought she saw someone jump out of a black car before the shooting began.  

The other car is thought to be red.

She added: 'Police should be around more. Like every corner.'

But a police spokesman said early investigations suggest two vehicles were heading in opposite directions shooting at each other.

Officers are anticipating bringing felonious assault charges against the three men.

The investigation continues.
