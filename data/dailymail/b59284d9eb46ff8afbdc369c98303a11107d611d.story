The quino checkerspot, found in Mexico and California, has moved to higher altitudes to avoid extinction, scientists claim

As the planet warms, animals and plants are learning to adapt to their new environment by either migrating or evolving, new research has revealed.

Many scientists believe the rate of climate change is too rapid for various species to keep up.

But two new studies have offered some hope that experts may have underestimated their abilities.

The first study reveals how a species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet.

The quino checkerspot, found in Mexico and California, moved to higher altitudes to avoid extinction, according to research presented at the Butterfly Conservation's symposium in Southampton.

Its rapid adaption offers some hope to scientists that other insects could be able to change their environment and survive a warmer climate.

Separate research led by Stanford University scientist Steve Palumbi found how some corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer-than-average tidal waters.

The research team discovered corals can adjust their internal functions to tolerate hot water 50 times faster than they would adapt through evolutionary change alone.

They were once believed to be impervious to fire, but it appears that increasing temperatures are having a shrinking effect on salamanders.

Wild salamanders in North America are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier, forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate.

Researchers from the University of Maryland found that salamanders in the Appalachians today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the Fifties.

The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations – settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most.

Scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and, the researchers sasy, this is strong confirmation of that prediction.

‘The temperature of coral reefs is variable, so it stands to reason that corals should have some capacity to respond to different heat levels,’ Professor Palumbi said.

‘These results tell us that both nature and nurture play a role in deciding how heat-tolerant a coral colony is.

‘Nurture, the effect of environment, can change heat tolerance much more quickly - within the lifetime of one coral rather than over many generations.’

It’s not just butterflies and corals that are adapting. From chipmunks to Mediterranean spiders, scientists are increasingly tracking how animals are evolving to cope with the effects of hotter temperatures.

‘Most of the models that ecologists are putting out are assuming that there's no adaptive capacity. And that's silly,’ Ary Hoffmann, a geneticist at the University of Melbourne told National Geographic. ‘Organisms are not static.’

Writing for Pacific Standard, systems biologist Michael White said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures.

Dr White cited the work of a team of 
scientists at the University of California-Berkeley as an example of how
 creatures are adapting to warmer temperatures.

The
 scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in Yosemite National Park 
and found that over 100 years the animals have moved to higher altitudes
 as the average temperature of the park has risen by 3°C.

DNA evidence suggests the European wasp spider (pictured) is evolving and has colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates. The spiders primarily lived in Mediterranean regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic region

DNA evidence also suggests the European wasp spider is evolving and have colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates.

The spiders primarily lived in Mediterranean regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic region.

Interestingly while scientists thought they were trying to find new places to live that were the same temperature as the Mediterranean before temperatures have risen, the spiders have actually moved into regions that are cooler than their original homes.

The reason for their behaviour is they have been mating with spiders that like the cold, to create an invading species that can survive freezing temperatures that would kill its Mediterranean relatives, researchers from Germany's Max Plank Institute told Dr White.

A 2011 review of data on hundreds of moving species found a average shift to higher altitudes of 36 feet (11 metres) per decade and a average shift to higher latitudes of about 10.5 miles (17 km) per decade.

‘I think we should feel impressed by the impact that we have, that we can change the course of evolution around us by the way we change the environment,’ Menno Schilthuizen, from Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands told National Geographic.

‘Our impact is much further and deeper than we tend to think.’

For the first time in millennia, the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million (ppm) for an entire month.

April’s
 carbon dioxide readings come less than a year after scientists warned 
that the amount of the gas in the Earth’s atmosphere could surpass the 
400ppm marker and stay there.

The gas is considered by many scientists to be responsible for global warming and has consistently breached the mark for a month – likely for the first time in 800,000 years.

April’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm, according to scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.

The institution is the custodian of the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements,which were started in the 1950s by Charles David Keeling on the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, USA Today reported.

Based on ice core samples  from the Antarctic ice sheet that preserve samples of old air, experts from Scripps said that carbon dioxide levels did not breach 300ppm prior to the industrial revolution for the past 800,000 years.
