Authorities have charged a college soccer coach with suffocating and strangling a 12-year-old northern New York boy nearly three years ago.

Police say 39-year-old Oral 'Nick' Hillary, the men's soccer coach at Clarkson University, was arrested Thursday at his home in the village of Potsdam.

He is charged with second-degree murder in the slaying of Garrett Phillips. The suspect pleaded not guilty and is in county jail without bail.

The boy was found unconscious inside his home after neighbors heard screams and cries for help on October 24, 2011.

Hillary is accused of suffocating and strangling the boy at his home.

He was pronounced dead that evening at a hospital. Officials say he had been strangled and suffocated with a pillow.

Hillary is being held without bail in the county jail. A message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.

Officials at Clarkson University, a Division III school in Potsdam, say Hillary is on administrative leave.

'I am 100 percent innocent. That's all I have to say,' said Hillary as he was brought in to the Potsdam Police Department.

District Attorney Mary Rain said Hillary was given the opportunity to turn himself in to Potsdam police, but didn't do so.

'The evidence in the case is significant,' she said.

She said Garrett Phillipsâ€™ mother, Tandy Cyrus, and several family members were present at the arraignment. Rain said the Potsdam police 'did a great job in pressing the case forward.'

At least two dozen people testified 
before the grand jury, including Phillips' mother, Tandy Cyrus, and the 
teenage daughter of Hillary.

Hillary, who had been involved in a 
relationship with Cyrus, was initially questioned by police as a person 
of interest in the boy's death but never charged.

The arrest
 comes after four days of closed-door testimony before a grand jury that
 began Monday. In a texted statement, Rain called it 'an emotional week'.

He has sued the village of Potsdam and the police department for defamation, claiming leaks during the investigation negatively affected his reputation.
