The environmental craze is not limited to trendy politicians and sandal-wearing tree-huggers - it seems that even drug producers are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint.

Police have discovered a huge cannabis factory powered by more than 100 environmentally friendly solar panels.

The factory contained 500 cannabis plants, with a street value of around £500,000.

It was found on Tuesday in the tiny village of Small Dole, near Horsham in Sussex.

Officers raided the warehouse, located on an industrial estate, using powers granted to them by the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Three people have been arrested - a 33-year-old woman, a 40-year-old man and a 55-year-old man.

Inspector Clare McKnight said: 'The 
police acted on information provided by our local community, and 
recovered a significant amount of cannabis.

'Drugs
have a devastating effect on a wide variety of people and the police in
Horsham are committed to holding those to account who are involved with
illegal drugs.'

A spokesman said that in addition to the 115 solar panels on the roof of the facility, there were 'several power sources' involved in growing the drug.

Powering cannabis factories is often a 
significant obstacle for drug producers, who must provide enough heat to
grow the plans while keeping their illegal operations hidden.

Officials in sun-drenched areas of the U.S. have reported wide-scale drug operations powered by solar panels, and have even warned about the risk of homeowners' legitimate solar panels being stolen by criminals.

However, there is little evidence that solar power has previously been used in the much more patchy climate of the UK.
