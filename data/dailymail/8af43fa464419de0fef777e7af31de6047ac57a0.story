It turns out there will be another day for Scarlett O'Hara's wardrobe.

Her iconic green curtain dress and burgundy ball gown from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind have been saved from deterioration by a £18,600 ($30,000) conservation effort in the US.

The dresses worn by actress Vivien Leigh are now on display for the first time in nearly 30 years at the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington, London, as part of a Hollywood costume exhibit.

Officials at the Harry Ransom Center research library at the University of Texas in Austin announced the project two years ago, noting the dresses were in danger of falling apart from age.

The dresses were made of heavy fabric and were not built to last. Weakened stitching and sagging waistlines had to be repaired.

Conservators also had to remove some previous alternation work and additions, such as feathers placed on the burgundy gown.

‘All of those areas would have got worse,' said Jill Morena, the Ransom Center's assistant curator for costumes and personal effects. 'All the vulnerable parts have been stabilised.'

She
stressed the project was not intended to restore the dresses to looking
brand new, but to save them so they could again be viewed by the 
public.

For example, the green dress has long faded streaks and conservators did not try to restore its original colour.

The Ransom Center acquired the dresses with the collection of film producer David O. Selznick in the 1980s.

Conservators wanted them ready in time for a 2014 Ransom Center exhibit to mark the film's 75th anniversary.

The costumes are among the most famous in Hollywood history and played a key role in one of the most popular films ever.

'The wedding veil, once you touched the tulle you realised how brittle and fragile it is'

The green curtain dress and the burgundy ball gown were completed in time to join the London exhibit which began last Saturday and runs through to January 27.

Other pieces, including a blue velvet night gown and Scarlett's wedding dress and veil, were too fragile to handle and will go back into storage.

The Ransom Center plans no additional work on those pieces. ‘The wedding veil, once you touched the tulle you realised how brittle and fragile it is,’ Ms Morena said.
