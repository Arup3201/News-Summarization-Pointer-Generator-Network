What's the best country to live in the world? well it's no other than Australia, as for the best place to live, that gong goes to the country's capital, Canberra. 

The OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has ranked the 362 regions of its 34 member nations according to nine measures of well-being which include income and education. Each were given a score out of ten.

Australia led the world ranking with a tidy 76.5 out of 90, following by Norway at 72.3, Canada, Sweden and then the US. 

Australia topped the world list for the best country to live, it's scorecard 76.5 out of 90 although education only scored a 6.6 out of 10

The nation's capital, Canberra, has been voted as the best place to live by OECD beating out Sydney and Melbourne

Despite being known for Sydney Harbour and it's popularity with visitors, Canberra was named the best place to live in the world. While Australia's scorecard was good enough to see it named best country to live

The country that didn't fare so well was Mexico, which ranked the worst country to live with a measley 15.1 out of 90 scoring zero for safety, housing and accessibility to services.

Poland, Hungary and Turkey were also judged as some of the hardest places in the world to live.

 All well-being scores out of 10

*Education - 6.6  

*Jobs - 8.4

*Income - 7.3       

*Safety - 9.8

*Health - 9     

*Environment - 9.5

*Civic Engagement - 10

*Accessibility to services - 7.2

*Housing - 8.7

An earlier version of the report was released in June but since then it has been updated to include one more measure of well being, which is access to affordable and quality housing.

That got a commendable score of 8.7 out of 10, while civic engagement took out the honours with full marks of 10, following closely behind was safety, environment and health. 

Even the low performing regions in Australia fare better than the OECD average in all of the well-being measures. 

But surprisingly Australia will have to work on its education which received a 6.6, well behind countries such as Canada, the Czech republic and Israel which recorded a high 9.

The share of the workforce with at least a secondary degree in the bottom 20 per cent of regions in Australia is 13 percentage points lower than the OECD average. 

The OECD has pointed out, large regional disparities in education, health, jobs and key services can  damage economic growth which in turn will lower well-being outcomes at a national level.

While some would argue that Sydney has the best beaches and harbour while Melbourne's pubs and cafes are a talking point, the nation's best place to live and work is our often mocked national capital, Canberra.

The territory received three top 10 scores, more than any other region included on the list, for safety, income and civic engagement. 

Even its lowest score, for the environment, was still a massive 9.1. Of all the nine indicators, Canberra total score was 86.2 out of a possible 90, thrashing the country's well being average.

While living conditions in Canberra might be top class, it has built up a reputation as a boring city with little to do

Canberra is truly the place to visit all-year round. During summer it's dry and desolate while in the winter months it is one of the coldest places in the country

As the political heartland of the country, Canberra, along with six other of our state's and territories received top score of 10 for its civic engagement - meaning Australia is more in tune with its political system than just about anywhere else.

The high number of voter engagement, about 95 per cent, was taken from the 2013 Federal Election and largely reflects the fact that voting in Australia is mandatory.  Australia had the highest average voter turnout of any other region based on the previous national election. Voter turnout is defined as the ratio between the number of voters to the number of persons with voting rights.

The statistics also confirmed the capital has a higher average income than the 360 regions identified, and it terms of its murder rate - that's practically non existent. Canberra has the lowest murder rate across Australia averaging just one in 100,000 people.

It's commonly confused that Sydney, and not Canberra, is referred to as Australia's capital city.

Despite its knockers, Canberra seems to be making its place on the world stage.

A New York Times article recently told its readers that while it does not compare to the 'glitzier city of Sydney' and  'there are no beaches or iconic opera houses' it does have 'big-sky beauty, breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly.'

The best way to enjoy Canberra, the Times said, is 'with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur-crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas.'

Unlike most cities, Canberra was purposefully built as the nation's capital and the road network is built with an incredibly high number of roundabouts

Income 10/10

Safety 10/10

Civic Engagement 10/10

Health 9.9/10

Accessibility to services 9.6/10

Jobs 9.6/10

Environment 9.5/10

Education 9.1/10

Housing 8.5/10

It also recommended going for a bicycle ride which loops one of the capital's premier attractions, it's lake. But it isn't just any lake, it was named after Chicago man, Walter Burley Griffin, who designed the capital built in the centre of Melbourne and Sydney.

Tasmania's score for education is 5.6, putting it in the bottom 27 per cent of the OECD regions. The ACT is high on the list, in the top 19 per cent, but when it comes to the country's natural environment, look no further than Tasmania, NSW and QLD which all score a perfect 10 out of 10.

The Northern Territory doesn't fare quite as well as its neighbouring state's and territories, scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety.Its health score is in the OECD's bottom 29 per cent, while its safety score is in the bottom 13 per cent.

Canberra and the ACT can count itself a lucky place to live, with a higher average income, civic engagement and better safety than some of the 300 regions on the OECD list
