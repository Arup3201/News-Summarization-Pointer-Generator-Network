Diet guru Jenny Craig is being sued by a comedienne after the woman claimed that weight loss products caused her to have a miscarriage and left her needing 1,000 gallstones removed.

Mara Shapshay, who has worked on sitcoms including Friends and South Park, launched a lawsuit this week for unspecified damages, claiming that she was left with serious health problems after using the diet products in 2011.

Ms Shapshay, who is also a magazine columnist, alleges that the Jenny Craig company is aware that their products can cause gall bladder disease but do not come with health warnings.

Ms Shapshay said that she had to undergo several surgeries following the Jenny Craig diet and has been left with  fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, according to TMZ. 

She also says the diet is responsible for a miscarriage she suffered.

In 1994, Jenny Craig Inc. settled a class action lawsuit from 360,000 clients in Orange County, California after it was alleged that products could cause gall bladder disease.

It agreed to a $10million payout and gave away $36million in merchandise but admitted no wrongdoing, according to the LA Times.

The Jenny Craig weight loss program 
was started in 1983 in Australia by Jenny Craig, now 80, and her husband
Sidney Harvey Craig.

The
diet was launched in the U.S. two years later and now has 700 centers 
across the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and Guam.

Promises: The Jenny Craig weight loss plan provides meals and support from diet consultants along with exercise recommendations

The program, which is followed by around 150,000 dieters at any point, offers 80 meal choices and snacks along with advise on portion sizes and exercise.

Jenny Craig Inc was bought by Nestlé in 2006 for $600million.

In a statement to MailOnline on Monday, a Jenny Craig spokesperson said: 'Out
of respect for the legal process, we usually do not comment on possible
litigation.  However, given this extreme claim we feel it is important to
publicly respond. 

'While Jenny Craig is sympathetic to any person
suffering from medical conditions, it is irresponsible to claim that the
Jenny Craig program was the cause of these issues. 

'Jenny Craig’s program,
whose clinical trial was published in JAMA in
2011, is designed by registered dieticians in close consultation with a medical
advisory board and reflects the guidelines of major health organizations.

'Clients following the Jenny Craig program, on average, lose 1-2 pounds per
week. This is a safe rate of weight loss that results from a
nutritionally-balanced menu that is moderately low in fat.  This lawsuit
is a clear attempt to incite the public and seek a quick settlement.'
