A father who was so ashamed of his huge beer belly he lost a whopping 10st has launched a new career - as a fitness instructor.

Ryan Griffiths, 32, lived off junk food and sugary coffees, a diet that saw him  tip the scales at 22st.

But after seeing a photograph of his bulky frame he decided to slim down.

He stopped eating fast food, and began exercising three hours a day, six days a week, and by last January he had managed dropped down to 15st.

By last August he had lost a further 3st and now weighs 12st and has gone from a size 48in waist to a trim 28in.

His dramatic weight loss has also meant he is no longer suffering from Type 2 diabetes which he was diagnosed with when he was 30. 

But it is not just Ryan's appearance and health that have been transformed by his weight loss. 

The father-of-two is about to quit his job as a mobile sales representative and launch his career as a personal fitness instructor after bosses at his gym were impressed by his transformation.

Ryan used to live off a diet of McDonald's for breakfast and lunch, up to four sugary Costa coffees and dinners of frozen pizza, as well as smoking 15 to 20 cigarettes a day.

He estimated that at this time he was consuming between 4,500 and 5,000 calories a day, twice the recommended daily intake for a man.

Ryan, who lives with his wife Kate, 32, son Joseph, three, and three-month-old baby daughter, Jessica, in Northampton, said: 'Now I struggle to get into skinny jeans because I have been working out at the gym, whereas before it was because of being overweight.

'I have learned so much about health and diet through having my own personal trainer and through working towards my own fitness qualifications.

'It had got to the stage before when I had to think about the consequences for my family. I very much feel it has saved my life.

'The turning point for me was in the summer of 2013 when I saw a picture of myself with a huge beer gut.

'It convinced me to start losing weight and every time I didn't feel like going to the gym I'd look at it and it would make me even more determined.

'When I first started to lose a lot of weight, people would come and ask me about it, and as I learned more I really enjoyed telling other people the facts about exercise and keeping fit.

'It was around March that I decided that I wanted to look into becoming a fitness instructor myself.

'In all I think it will have cost about £1,100 to get the training and sit the practical and written exams for my Level Two and Level Three personal trainer qualifications.

'But the gym I am at has said they will give me a job, which is wonderful.

'Since losing all the weight I just feel so much more energetic and lively, and it's much more fun for playing with the kids too.

'And with the diabetes, the nurse said it was only the second time she had seen someone come off the medication through losing weight.

'For anyone trying to lose weight I would just say to set yourself achievable goals, don't try to get everything done at once.

'And it's important to remember than no food is off limits, you just have to monitor your calorie intake along with protein, carbs and fats.

'You can eat what you like, but once you reach your daily limit you just have to stop.

'So you can eat chocolate, or some pizza, but just be aware of how much you are eating and do it in moderation.

'I still have a takeaway pizza to myself once a week, but I take that into account when working out what else I can eat that day.' 

Ryan says he now feels so much more energetic and lively and wants to help others achieve similar results

Ryan's gruelling fitness regime sees him work out from 4am to 7am six days a week and now eats 3,000 calories a day to help him build up muscle.

He passed his Level Two personal trainer qualification in October, and recently passed Level Three meaning his is qualified to work as a fitness instructor.

He is now preparing to work with customers at his local Pure Gym in Northampton, where he works out six days a week.

PureGym Manager, Darren Eele, said: 'It has been great to watch the transformation that Ryan has gone through since joining PureGym.

'His hard work and dedication can only be an inspiration to others, and it will be a pleasure to have Ryan as one of the team here at PureGym as one of our Personal Trainers.'
