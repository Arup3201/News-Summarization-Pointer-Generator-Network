Accused: Ryan Wyngarden goes on trial this week for the murder of his sister and her husband

A man accused of shooting dead his sister and her husband out of fear she would reveal their incestuous sexual relationship is set to go on trial 26 years later - after his wife told investigators he had admitted to the killing.

Ryan Wyngarden, a 51-year-old married father-of-four, will appear in court in Grand Haven in Ottawa County, Michigan on Tuesday for the first day of his murder trial.

The case of Rick and Gail Brink, who were
 found shot dead at their home in November 1987, laid unsolved until investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview Wyngarden and his wife.

At first, Pam Wyngarden stuck to the 
story she had repeated for decades: That she and her husband were 
visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at 
the time of the killings.

But during interviews in January 2013,
 the mother-of-four changed her story, saying that she could no longer hide his secret and claiming that her husband had 
admitted to shooting dead the Brinks.

At
 a hearing in February 2013, she said they had only been dating a few 
months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he 
feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as 
teenagers.

'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.'

Killed: Rick and Gail Brink were shot dead in their home in November 1987, 18 months after they married

Victims: Wyngarden allegedly shot the couple because he was worried she would reveal they had sex as teens

At a hearing last year, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating.

'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, "What's wrong?" and he said, "I shot and killed Rick and Gail". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.'

When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said.

Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one.

She said she married him regardless of 
his confession because she craved love and support for her and her two 
children, one of whom was his.

Revelations: Pam Wyngarden, pictured in court last year after the case was re-opened, told investigators that her husband had admitted to killing the couple and she agreed to help him cover it up

Denial: Wyngarden sobbed throughout the hearing in February 2013 and yelled that he was not guilty

In the years after Wyngarden allegedly
 told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and 
would not allow her to have any friends in fear that she would tell 
them, she said.

As she spoke in court last year, her husband sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't!'

But Crystal Beelen, a former girlfriend of 
Wyngarden's, also testified that Wyngarden admitted that 
he had had a sexual relationship with his sister when they were 
teenagers.

The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding.

In the hearing last year, Mrs Brink said she found her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home.

Happier times: Pam Wyngarden, pictured, said her husband, right, became controlling because he worried she would share his secret. Last year, she said she said she could no longer hide the truth

The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths.

The case fell cold as investigators found
 no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been 
victims of mistaken identity.

Ottawa County Sheriff's Capt. Mark Bennett told Michigan Live
 that several civilians, retired officers and sheriff's detectives are 
expected to return to the town to testify about the on-scene 
investigation.

The trial is expected to take at least two weeks. If convicted, Wyngarden would face a sentence of life in prison.
