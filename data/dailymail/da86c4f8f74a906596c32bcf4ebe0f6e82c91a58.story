The privately educated sister of Boris Johnson has tried being poor for a week for a BBC documentary.

And it seems the experience has left author Rachel Johnson feeling slightly guilty.

Ms Johnson - a one time editor of society magazine The Lady - said she had previously assumed poor people had spent all of their money on cigarettes, alcohol and television, until she took part in BBC1's Famous, Rich and Hungry.

She said: 'The poor people you see on the box are all fat. How in God's name, can you be overweight and hungry? Now I know.'

She joined a family in Deptford, south-east London, where the budget for food was little more than a £1 a day.

She said the diet comprised mostly of 'white bread, sugar, and frozen stuff', and the realisation soon dawned that poverty and obesity are two sides of the same coin.

The Mayor's sister said the experience had made her realise how much money she has wasted, and think twice about spending £3 for a 'flat white' coffee, after realising how much food the figure could buy for a 'poor family'.

She told the Radio Times: 'There's this terrible sense of human waste. They're existing, rather than living, like battery hens. Apart from the telly and the cigarettes, they are living like animals.'

But she said that her friends 'bizarrely' were rather envious of her experience, believing she was 'lucky old Rachel' after going on her 'poverty safari'.

She added: '... An experience they can never have, even with all of the money they've got.'

Famous, Rich and Hungry will see Made
 In Chelsea's Jamie Laing, ex-EastEnders actress Cheryl Fergison, 
Dragons' Den's Theo Paphitis and Ms Johnson live with
 families who are experiencing food poverty in the UK.

The contestants will 'put
 their lives of privilege and luxury behind them and experience what 
life is really like for people in Britain today who can't afford to 
eat', the BBC, who has commissioned the show, confirmed last month.

Bye bye luxury: Benefits Street will get a celebrity makeover in the new two-part documentary, set to include Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing (pictured), from the people behind the controversial Channel 4 programme

The hour-long shows, which are being produced by Love Productions - which also produced the controversial programme Benefits Street - will be broadcast on BBC1 in March as part of Sport Relief.

A spokesman for the channel earlier told the 
MailOnline that the programme will include people in a variety of 
circumstances, and isn't just about people living on benefits.

Previous series have included Famous, Rich and in the Slums, Famous, Rich and Homeless and Famous, Rich and Jobless.
