The accused Pennsylvania cop-killer  continues to elude more than 200 officers after being sighted near his old high school with a rifle Friday night.

An eastern Pennsylvania woman told authorities that she saw a man wearing all black, with his face covered in mud and a rifle in his hands in a wooded area near Pocono Mountain East High School, according to Lehigh Valley Live.

The sighting is 'highly credible' and is believed to have been Eric Matthew Frein, 31, the man police have been hunted for more than a month after the Sept. 12 murder of a Pennsylvania state trooper and wounding of another. Frein attended the high school, according to Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens.

Wanted: Eric Frein, 31, has been the target of an intense manhunt for more than a month after killing a Pennsylvania trooper and wounding another

Skilled: Frein is described as a survivalist and 'gun enthusiast' with a grudge against law enforcement officials

'We're not going to rest,' Gov. Tom Corbett said at a news conference Saturday.

'Nobody's going to stop until we find this individual and he's apprehended.'

ABC News reports that the woman allegedly saw Frein and was able to describe him with great detail from less than 20 feet away.

Authorities say that along with the woman's reports, another person reported possibly seeing Frein, and two more people reported finding what may have been blood on their porches, according to ABC News.

The blood is being tested and authorities have not determined if it belongs to Frein. 

Bivens said at the conference that the search for Frein may become easier as the weather changes in the fall and winter months. 

'I think we've kept a tremendous amount of pressure on him,' he said.

The New York Daily News reports that the manhunt for Frein costs approximately $1.1 million a week.
