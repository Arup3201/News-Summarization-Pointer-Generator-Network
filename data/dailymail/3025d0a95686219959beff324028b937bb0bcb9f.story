Each year, the New York Police Department and the Fire Department of New York get together for a friendly ice hockey game, all in the name of charity.

However, this year's match degenerated into an ugly scene in the second period when the teams were matched at three-three.

Bench-clearing: Players from each side brawled at a Fire Department vs NYPD charity ice hockey game

Regular: The charity match has been held for 41 years, but this year it saw a huge brawl

However, this year's match degenerated into an ugly scene in the second period when the teams were matched at three-three.

According to the website, the event is 'all about coming together to enjoy sportsmanship and helping others.'

It about beating up the opposing team in a thuggish fashion.

Players from both sides can be seen on YouTube videos of the fight clearing the bench to join the brawl, which left the ice littered with hockey sticks and gloves.

The only two players who didn't appear to be involved was each team's goalie. The pair can be seen standing together on the middle of the rink watching the chaos going on around them.

Referees struggled to break up the brawl between the city's protectors, many of whom limped off the ice with black eyes and bruises.

Observers: The only two who appeared not to be fighting were the goalkeepers in the middle of the rink  

The fight, which became several scattered one-on-one punch-ups, caused a 25 minute delay as players were penalized and equipment picked up off the ice.

'It was reminiscent of the old-time Rangers-Flyers games in the mid-70s,' an NYPD cop who was at the game at the Nassau Coliseum told the New York Post. 'I was waiting for [legendary Philadelphia Flyers enforcer] Dave Schultz to come out on the ice,' he said, adding that he's been attending the charity matches for 20 years and never seen such a bench-clearing fight.  The crowd in videos posted you YouTube and Instagram can be heard taunting both teams, with some chanting, 'FD sucks, FD sucks!' and 'Dun-kin Do-nuts,' the latter of which was directed at the police.The match was eventually won eight to five by the NYPD.
