A long-lost diary belonging to one of Adolf Hitler's senior henchman has been found at a private company in upstate New York after it went missing 70 years ago.

The 400 loose, handwritten pages were pictured on Thursday as federal authorities announced at a press conference that they had seized the wartime diary of Nazi official Alfred Rosenberg after it went missing 70 years ago.

The diary pages were found at a business in Lewiston, New York.

Harrowing tales: A diary has been recovered which belonged to Hitler confidant Alfred Rosenberg with the chilling language of the fascist regime

A criminal investigation has been launched to work out how Rosenberg's diary, a key portion of evidence during the Nuremberg trials, ended up in the U.S., CNN reported.

Senior Nazi Alfred Rosenberg played a significant role in 
the slaughter of millions of Jews and other non-Aryans considered 
inferior under the Third Reich.

He was convicted of war crimes at the 
Nuremberg trials after World War II and executed in 1946.

Officials say Rosenberg's diary was smuggled 
into the U.S. after the war, most likely by Robert M.W. 
Kempner, a government lawyer during the Nuremberg trials.

Born in Germany, Kempner had fled to America in the 1930s to escape the Nazis, only to return for post-war trials.

Kempner
 cited a few Rosenberg diary excerpts in his memoir, and in 1956 a 
German historian published entries from 1939 and 1940. But the bulk of 
the diary never surfaced.

The lawyer died in 1993, and museum officials later took possession of some of his
 extensive document collection. But the Rosenberg diary remained missing
 until recently.

'One of 
the enduring mysteries of the Second World War is what happened to the 
Rosenberg diary,' said John Morton, director of U.S. Immigrations and 
Custom Enforcement said on Thursday.

'We have solved that mystery.'

Learning from the horrors of the past: Holocaust experts are set to decipher and examine the diary in detail

The search for the diary dates to 1996, when two of Kempner's 
former legal secretaries approached a Holocaust museum official about 
Kempner's collection of papers.

Over
 several years, museum officials assessed and took possession 
of several documents from Kempner's collection, although some material 
they initially viewed in 1997 at Kempner's Pennsylvania home were 
missing when they went to retrieve the papers.

Officials later learned that the two secretaries and 'another gentleman from upstate New York' had taken the papers.

Officials
 later found the materials at the home in Lewiston, New York, with the 
help of a private investigator and former FBI agent.

Acting
 upon a warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge in Delaware, 
authorities seized the diary in April. Authorities repeatedly refused to
 say who had the diary.

'After a bit of negotiation, shall we say, we were allowed to remove this material,' Mayer said. He offered no other details.

On Thursday, officials from the 
Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department joined 
experts from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for a news conference to
 outline how they found the documents, which cover the years 1936 to 
1944.

Gerhard 
Weinberg, professor emeritus of history at the University of North 
Carolina and a leading historian on the Nazi era, said the diary could 
shed new light on Rosenberg's role in administering the occupied eastern
 territories, and his relationships with other high-ranking Nazi 
officials.

Museum officials
 said the documents provide valuable information, as Rosenberg helped 
orchestrate the looting of artwork and other valuables from 
Nazi-occupied territory during that the time.

'Its
 discovery will undoubtedly give scholars new insight into the politics 
of Nazi leaders and fulfills a museum commitment to uncover evidence 
from perpetrators of the Holocaust,' the web posting said.

Researchers have yet to begin a thorough examination of Rosenberg's diary.

But Henry Mayer, a senior adviser on archives for the Holocaust museum, suggested that it will offer some 'amazing new evidence' and that he believes some of the material will contradict written history.

Rosenberg, a Nazi ideologue and propagandist, was the author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a 1930 book espousing the superiority of Aryan culture over the Jewish race.

He later led the Nazi Party's foreign affairs department and rose through the party hierarchy to become Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories in 1941.

'It is very possible that, at least to some extent, there will be clues not just to Rosenberg's total lack of brilliance, but there will, or well might be, interesting bits of information on conversations he had with other important figures in the government,' Weinberg said of the diary.

'It's important that as soon as possible, somebody decipher the handwriting and publish, hopefully, an annotated edition of this material,' Weinberg said. 

'It is also possible that we will all be disappointed. There may turn out to be very little that we don't know.'

Among
 early translated excerpts is a passage from 1941 in which Rosenberg 
wrote proudly of a conference marking 'the first time in European 
history that 10 European nations were represented at an anti-Jewish 
conference with the clear program to remove this race from Europe. ...'

Historic role: Robert M. W. Kempner, a Nuremberg prosecutor, was long suspected by U.S. officials of smuggling Rosenberg's diary out of Germany after the Nazi trials

Later that year, Rosenberg wrote of reports that Russian leader Josef Stalin had ordered the 400,000 Volga Germans 'to be dragged away to Siberia, i.e. to have them murdered. ...'

'Yesterday I had a proposal drafted for communication by broadcast to Russia, England and the USA that in case this mass murder is implemented, Germany will punish the Jews of Central Europe for this.'

Other translated excerpts involve the 1936 Olympic games, including Rosenberg's assertions that Britons were 'angry about the negroes from the USA as they squeeze out the English during the Olympic Games'.
