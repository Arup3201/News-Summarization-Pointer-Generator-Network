Painful: Mark Zuckerberg, pictured, has admitted watching his company's share price tumble has been hard

Mark Zuckerberg has admitted Facebook's tanking share price is 'painful' to watch, as the stock fell to $19 - half its IPO price - this afternoon.

The uncomfortable milestone came a day after a lock-up period expired, meaning early investors have been able to ditch their shares in the social network for the first time since May.

The stock, which closed on its first day just above its initial public offering price of $38, plummeted 87 cents, or 4 per cent, to $19 in Friday afternoon trading. It closed at $19.05.

Zuckerberg has kept quiet about his brainchild's sinking stock price but revealed his disappointment at a company-wide meeting earlier this month, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The 28-year-old conceded that it may be 'painful' to watch as investors continue to retreat from Facebook's stock, people familiar with the meeting, held as part of a new effort to boost morale, told the newspaper.

The current slump has seen Zuckerberg's personal fortune dwindle to around $10 billion, down from a peak of $20 billion in May.

But the co-founder wasn't the only one expressing disappointment.

Critics have begun calling for Zuckerberg to be replaced as CEO amid the slump in the share price, claiming he may not be cut out for the job.

'Mark Zuckerberg resign as $FB CEO immediately,' one user said on Twitter this morning, after a Los Angeles Times article questioned his place at the helm.

On Thursday, Facebook's stock 
plunged 6.3 per cent to an all-time low as company insiders were allowed to begin dumping hundreds of millions of shares for the first time.

Diving: Mark Zuckerberg has admitted Facebook's tanking share price is 'painful' to watch, as the stock, pictured, fell to $19 - half its IPO price - in today's trading

Awe Zucks! Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who retains a controlling stake in the company, lost an estimated $1billion today

Investors ranging from Accel 
Partners to Goldman Sachs, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Facebook board 
members James Breyer, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman are among those free 
to now sell stock they own after a lockup expired.

The
world's largest social networking site closed at $19.87 -- shedding 
$1.33 a share from the day before and losing at $2.8 billion in market 
value.

With Thursday's sell-off, Facebook has lost $40 billion, or just under 50 per cent, of its market value since its IPO on May 18.

The stock, which debuted at $38, hit a session low of $19.69 on Nasdaq, before trading down 5 per cent at $20.13 early Thursday afternoon.

Zuckerberg himself lost nearly $670million on Thursday morning alone.

A massive sell-off became clear almost as soon as markets opened. Within the first hour, about 64million shares of Facebook changed hands. The daily average trading for the company is 30million.

By the end of the day the volume of trading of five times normal -- 157 million shares -- as panicked shareholders looked to ditch the company.

It's not yet 
known whether the investors who were in a lock-up until Thursday were the ones fueling the sell-off. The stock price decline could 
reflect investors' anticipation of such a move.

More than 270 million shares have been unlocked -- more than one-half of the 421 million that were in the market after the initial public offering of the social networking company.

Thumbs down: Facebook shares have lost half their market value since its May public offering

Losses: If shares of Facebook reach $19, the stock will have lost fully half of its value since the initial public offering

'Pressure will be back on the shares now that liquidity is back in the market,' said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York. 'If (the value of) your holdings has been cut in half, are you going to sit around and risk the rest of that?'

It's conceivable no one 
would sell those extra shares, but if too many do, Facebook's stock would decline even more because the market would be flooded with additional 
shares

It's been a rough run for 
Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook 
suffered what may be the most-botched public offering as trading 
glitches marred its first day. 

Lock-ups prevent company insiders from selling their shares in a newly-floated firm.

They usually start to expire 90 days from the initial public offering (IPO).

They are designed to prevent the share price from fluctuating wildly if too many investors decide to sell their shares all at once.

The lockup expired for initial investors on Thursday. It expires for Facebook employees in October.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg must keeps his shares until November.

Facebook, the world's No. 1 Internet social network with 955 million users, has seen its shares pummeled since the market debut in May that put its value at more than $100 billion.

Investors
have been concerned about Facebook's ability to keep increasing revenue
and make money from its growing mobile audience, even as many analysts 
hold positive long-term views.

Facebook’s stock has been down on 38 trading days, up on 25 and unchanged on one since its initial public offering.Those eligible 
to sell additional shares on Thursday were the investors and directors who 
had participated in the May IPO. The exception was CEO Mark Zuckerberg, 
who will be ineligible until November.

Other 
shareholders, including many Facebook employees, will be able to sell 
beginning in October. The last lock-up period expires next May, a year 
after the IPO.

In all, up to 1.91 billion more
shares could flood the stock market over the next several months -- more
than four times the 421 million shares that have been trading since 
Facebook's IPO. Of the 1.91 billion, 271 million shares became eligible 
for sale on Thursday.
