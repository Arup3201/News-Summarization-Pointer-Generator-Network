Castleford have announced the signing of London Broncos utility player Matt Cook on a two-year deal from the start of the 2015 season.

The 27-year-old, who had a short spell on loan with the Tigers in 2008, has made 22 appearances this season but has decided his future lies away from the Hive Stadium, with the Broncos' relegation from Super League already confirmed.

'I'm excited by how the Tigers are playing this season. I already know a few of the boys and I've heard nothing but good things about the place, the players and the coaches,' said Cook.

'I'm looking forward to having room for my own game to improve, and I feel that I can only get better under Daryl Powell. To be part of a club that is challenging for silverware and to be part of what they have built here will really be something special.'

Cook is Castleford's fourth signing for next season following the captures of his current London team-mate Denny Solomona and Melbourne Storm duo Junior Moors and Ben Roberts.

Tigers coach Powell said: 'Matt Cook is a quality individual player. I have been hugely impressed with him this season as a performer and a leader throughout a tough season for London.

'His size and strength will be great for us next season and his ability to play in both front and back row is a great attribute.'

Transfer: Cook's two-year contract with Castleford will start from the beginning of the 2015 season
