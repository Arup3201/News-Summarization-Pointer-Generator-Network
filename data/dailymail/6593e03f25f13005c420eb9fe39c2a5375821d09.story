Bench: The ex-Chelsea midfielder came on as a substitute against the USA and injured a toe

Ghana now face an extremely difficult task to reach the last-16 of the World Cup as their remaining matches are against Germany, who won beat Portugal 4-0, and a Portuguese side containing Ballon D'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo.

Coach Kwesi Appiah has been questioned for his decision to leave both the former Chelsea midfielder and forward Kevin-Prince Boateng on the bench in their opening match, and could start them against Germany.

Ghana made the quarter-finals at South Africa 2010, becoming only the third African team to reach the last eight in the process.
