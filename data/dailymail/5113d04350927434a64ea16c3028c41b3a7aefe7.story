If you like window shopping and have a cool £235,000 burning a hole in your pocket, department store Harrods has just the thing to lift your spirits.

The new sporty Rolls-Royce Wraith sportback coupe has pride of place in the store’s vast window in London’s Knightsbridge and billed as ‘the most powerful and dynamic Rolls-Royce in history’.

It can even ‘read’ the road ahead and has lights in the roof to give the impression of a starry night sky.

Pride of place: The new £235,000 Rolls-Royce Wraith sportback coupe has been unveiled in the Harrods vast store window as 'the most powerful and dynamic Rolls-Royce in history'

The new four-seater two-door Wraith is described as ‘the ultimate gentleman’s grand tourer’ but Rolls-Royce expect super-rich women customers to be queuing up for it too.

It is on sale now from £235,000 with first deliveries in September. But be sure those little extras and bespoke individual touches will push the final price somewhat higher.

Rolls-Royce says the new Wraith epitomises luxury, refinement and hand-craftsmanship, power, style and drama ‘with just a hint of the noir’.

Some 1,340 tiny fibre-optic lamps are 
hand-woven into the roof lining to give ‘the impression of a glittering,
starry night sky’. It has a head-up display, adaptive headlights and 
keyless opening boot.

'Promises a sense of adventure': At the first unveiling in Geneva Rolls-Royce chief executive Torsten Müller-Ötvö said the car's 'starting point was luxury, refinement and quality'

The Wraith was delicately spirited into 
the Harrod’s shop window in the dead of night after Rolls-Royce decided 
to bring the two-door coupé to its exclusive customers in a setting less
formal than the conventional car showroom.

Its spectacular arrival is being 
celebrated with a special after hours VIP party at Harrods tonight 
hosted by Rolls-Royce – with its headquarters in the grounds of the Earl
of March’s Goodwood  estate in Sussex, and its German parent company 
BMW.

Named after an 
ethereal spirit, the sumptuous Rolls-Royce supercar’s appearance is also
expected to create lots of work for window cleaners from the pressed 
noses and fingerprints of less well-heeled admirers putting their mark 
on shopfront glass as they dream of that elusive lottery win. 

At its original unveiling at the Geneva 
Motor show this March, Rolls-Royce chief executive Torsten Müller-Ötvös,
CEO Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, remarked: ‘Wraith promises the sense of 
adventure and speed that drove our founding forefather. But of course, 
Wraith’s starting point is luxury, refinement and quality, traits that 
remain as important to Rolls-Royce customers today as they were more 
than a century ago.’

Rolls-Royce said it was these traits 
of luxury, refinement and quality that made Harrods the natural choice 
for Wraith’s UK debut.

Mr Müller-Ötvös said: 'Renowned
globally as purveyors of the world’s finest goods, both Harrods and 
Rolls-Royce have exceeded client expectations for over a century’.

Rolling in it: Rolls-Royce said it was the traits of luxury, refinement and quality that made Harrods the natural choice for the Wraith's UK debut

Harrods media sales director, Guy Cheston, said: 'Harrods is at the forefront of promotional opportunities for the world’s most esteemed automotive brands and we are delighted to have on display the most anticipated car release of 2013. The Rolls-Royce Wraith epitomises luxury, style and innovation, and is certain to attract attention from our international clientele.’

The Wraith, on display for a week 
until Saturday May 4, features Midnight Sapphire paintwork with an upper
two-tone in Cassiopeia Silver, accentuating Wraith’s purposeful 
fastback profile.

The 
interior is finished with an Arctic White and Navy Blue leather scheme 
with intertwined RRs embroidered in the headrests in Navy and, unique 
for this model, the striking new Canadel Panelling in Santos Palisander.

Read the road: The coupe has a satellite aided transmission which uses GPS data to see beyond what the driver sees to anticipate what gear is most appropriate

Rolls-Royce said: 'Completing this spectacular interior is a starlight headliner, casting a glow from hundreds of individual ‘stars’ in the roof lining at the press of a button.

As well as offering supercar acceleration combined with elegantly luxurious comfort, the new low-slung Wraith features ground-breaking ‘satellite aided transmission’ which uses the car’s sat-nav GPS mapping to ‘read’ the road ahead and pre-select the correct gear in advance – even when confronted with roundabouts and motorway junctions.

The Wraith also features voice-activated controls – dubbed an ‘on board valet’ – which includes a sat-nav which can be instructed: ‘Navigate to Piccadilly in London’.

The latest car to bear the legendary ‘Spirit of Ecstasy’ Flying Lady figurine is powered by a mighty 6.7 litre V12 petrol engine developing 624 brake horse-power - equivalent to six Ford Fiestas.

Linked to an eight-speed automatic gear-box, the new Wraith will accelerate from zero to 60mph in just 4.4 seconds with its top speed artificially limited to 155mph.

That ‘effortless, but dramatic’ acceleration compares to 4.7 seconds for the with existing 563 bhp  Rolls-Royce Ghost but it still has the ‘the sensation of riding on a bed of air.’

Rolls-Royce said the new Wraith, reviving an ethereal spirit name first used in 1938, goes on sale in late Autumn, early Winter this year.

But you’ll need deep pockets for the fuel bills from a car which averages just 20.2miles to the gallon, rising to 28.8mpg when cruising but just 13.3mpg around town. CO2 emissions are 327g/km. The Wraith features a ‘yacht-like interior’ cabin with Canadel wood panelling.

A spokesman said: 'It is named after the famous cove in the South of France where Sir Henry Royce and his design and engineering teams spent their winters.’

On display: The Wraith will be on display in the department store's front window for a week and 'certain to attract attention from our international clientele,' a Harrods spokesman said

Its ‘fast-back’ coupe design including a raked rear windscreen, angled grille, wide but low stance and two-tone paint to ‘evoke the image of a world class athlete poised in the starting blocks,’ said Rolls-Royce.

The two rear-hinged coach doors open outwards to reveal a sumptuous interior complete with softest leathers.

Rolls-Royce said: ’It has the most powerful, involving driving experience of any Rolls-Royce in history.'

Explaining the hi-tech system to ‘read’ the road ahead and pre-select gears, a Rolls-Royce spokesman said: ‘The Satellite Aided Transmission uses GPS data to see beyond what the driver sees. It anticipates his or her next move based on location and current driving style then selects the most appropriate gear for the terrain ahead.

‘Corners, motorway junctions and roundabouts are all anticipated in advance meaning Wraith is constantly poised to deliver on its promise of performance. It takes the power train to a new level of effortless delivery. The more polished, effortless driving experience and even better response brings a new, more dynamic dimension to the famous Rolls-Royce trait - waftability.'

Rolls-Royce was founded after sales and marketing genius, the Honorable Charles Stewart Rolls, a passionate racing driver, balloonist and aviator, met legendary engineer Henry Royce at the Midland Hotel in Manchester on May 4 1904 with the aim of creating the world's finest motor car.

German car giant BMW bought Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from Vickers PLC in 1998 following a bidding war with rivals Volkswagen which secured Bentley - with the first BMW-produced Rolls-Royce Phantom launched in 2003.

It employs 1,050 staff having taken on an extra 100 staff last year.
