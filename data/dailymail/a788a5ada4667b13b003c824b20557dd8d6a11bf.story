Jailed: Lorry driver Ethan Roberts admitted causing the deaths of a married couple after he crashed into them while texting his girlfriend

A lorry driver has been jailed after his HGV toppled onto a car killing a married couple while he texted a girlfriend.

Ethan Roberts, 44, deleted the message before police arrived at the crash scene in an attempt to avoid getting caught, a court heard.

Hair salon boss Mark McHale, 46, and his wife Tamsie, 43, a primary school deputy head, were crushed to death on the motorway as they drove to Manchester Airport for a holiday to Cuba.

Roberts, of Immingham, Lincolnshire, was texting as he drove on a 50mph roadwork section of the M62 near Leeds, West Yorks.

He had received 58 messages from girlfriend Helen Chapman in three days before the crash - all while he was driving, Leeds Crown Court heard.

Roberts was jailed for five yeas and three months after admitting causing two deaths by dangerous driving.

Sentencing, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'Those who drive HGVs owe a particular responsibility to other road users because of the nature of the vehicle they drive and because the results of dangerous driving can be catastrophic.

'Evidence clearly shows you had a regular habit of reading and composing and sending text messages while driving.

'If ever a case demonstrated the 
obvious danger of that this is it and the danger in doing that was 
obvious and it created a grossly avoidable distraction.

Victims: Mark and Tamsie McHale were crushed to death in the motorway crashed as they drove to the airport for a holiday to Cuba

Tragic: Roberts' 19-tonne HGV toppled into the car and crushed Mr and Mrs McHale on the M62

'You
received a text message very shortly before the collision and you were 
either reading it or composing a reply when you lost control of your 
lorry.'

Happy: Mr McHale owned a hair salon in Bishop Auckland, County Durham

Prosecutor Richard 
Clews told Leeds Crown Court that Roberts’ 19 tonne articulated lorry 
began to veer into the inside lane as he was distracted by his mobile 
phone messages, on July 25, last year.

It
pushed Mr McHale’s Audi into the third lane, facing the wrong way, and 
the lorry jack-knifed, its fully loaded trailer unit toppled onto the 
car, crushing and killing McHale and his wife Tamsie.

Mr Mchale owned Hair Haus, in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, and his wife was deputy head at Gilesgate Primary School, Durham.

Judge Marson said the hard-working couple were 'on their way no doubt to a well-earned holiday'.

Roberts tried to blame Mr McHale for the crash and examination of his phone showed no messages at the time concerned - but checks revealed a text had been deleted.

Further records showed that Roberts had received 58 text messages from Helen Chapman over the last three days - all while tachograph records showed he was driving.

The last one had arrived about one minute 16 seconds before the collision. He had sent 48 messages to her in return.

'It is clear he was in the habit of both reading and composing text messages while driving and had done so frequently on the day of the collision,' said Mr Clews.

Cover-up: The court heard Roberts had deleted the text message following the M62 crash in a bid to hide his guilt

'In all probability, the defendant was either reading the message from Helen Chapman or had read it and was in the process of making a reply. There is no other reason for deleting it.'

The court heard Roberts was driving from Grimsby to Burnley, Lancashire, when the accident happened shortly before 6am.

After the collision he was found by witnesses bleeding in the cab of his vehicle and on the phone to his boss.

Roberts admitted two charges of causing the deaths of Mr and Mrs McHale by dangerous driving.

He was jailed for five years and three months and disqualified from driving for five years.

The judge said he accepted Roberts had not set out that day to kill or injure anybody and that his remorse was genuine.

But it was a seriously aggravating feature that he was in the habit of texting while driving, he said.

Mitigating Peter Horgan told the court he had been driving HGVs for 13 years, doing an average 30,000 miles a year without a problem.

'He accepts on occasions he did make and send text messages.'
