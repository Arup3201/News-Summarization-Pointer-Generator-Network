Judging by this raunchiest of rumbas, this might have been the moment when the Curse of Strictly struck again.

Ben Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff got the judges hot under the collar as they gyrated their way through the steamy routine in the third week of last year’s show.

Indeed their chemistry was so apparent in their performance of the ‘dance of love’ that presenter Tess Daly commented: ‘We can all feel the love after that one.’

Speculation is rife that the dance was a turning point in the former England rugby star’s increasingly intimate friendship with Ms Rihanoff – and his marriage to his wife of 11 years

Although they were eliminated in the ninth week of the show, the pair have continued their friendship

Now speculation is rife that the dance was a turning point in the former England rugby star’s increasingly intimate friendship with Ms Rihanoff – and his marriage to his wife of 11 years.

On Wednesday Cohen announced he had separated from Abby, 36, the mother of his twin girls, Harriette and Isabelle, six.

Cohen has already revealed that she was forced to flee rehearsals in the days leading up to the show after walking in on him and Ms Rihanoff in a passionate embrace as part of their practice.

Although they were eliminated in the ninth week of the show, the pair have continued to maintain their friendship. In January, months after they left the BBC programme, a fan tweeted a picture of them walking down the street with the caption: ‘These two go everywhere together!! Lol’. 

To which the Siberian-born dancer replied: ‘Ha! No I don’t go to the gym with him! Lol’.

They have often exchanged messages on Twitter and supported each other’s charity events. While Mrs Cohen was included in earlier online conversations, the two women have not talked to each other on the site for months.

Ms Rihanoff’s rumba with Cohen scored straight sevens from the judges.

Darcey Bussell said: ‘You created a true intensity between both of you, fabulous.’ Bruno Tonioli added: ‘That was really a touchy feely kind of love.’

Lawyers for the couple said in a statement: ‘There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.’
