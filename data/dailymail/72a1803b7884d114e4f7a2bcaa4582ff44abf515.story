She was a promising film-maker on the verge of a stellar career. But rather than pursuing her Hollywood dream, Donna Hanssen chose to turn her back on the big time for a life on conservation's front line.

Outraged by figures that revealed Namibia's carnivore population had halved during the 1980s, she and her siblings launched AfriCat - a pioneering organisation that has saved more than 1,000 lions, leopards and cheetahs since 1993.

But, says the veteran conservationist, while numbers are picking up, the animals are still under threat - both from poachers and from farmers who shoot the animals as they move across their land for fear of what might happen to their cows if they don't.

Hard at work: Donna Hanssen turned her back on a promising film career to dedicate her life to protecting Namibia's endangered lions, leopards and cheetahs

'What I love about big cats is their survival instinct, their independence, their patience and their beauty,' smiles Donna.'They're so essential for keeping the balance and they mostly take out the weak and the old, so that the strong are left to breed.'

As in other African countries, Namibia's big cats are coming under increasing pressure from human farmers and, although not to the same extent as rhinos and elephants, are also threatened by poaching.

Currently, the country is home to an estimated 6,000 cheetahs, 4,000 leopards and around 600 lions, while the number of African Wild Dogs - a species particularly loathed because of their vicious habit of ripping chunks of flesh out of living animals - is unknown but thought to be low.

Most of those rescued by the AfriCat Foundation are the victims of traps and snares; some of which leave the animal so injured, it can never be released back into the wild.

For the lucky ones, rescue means being given a new life in Etosha National Park, a stretch of wilderness in northern Namibia that covers 8,600sqm chunk of savannah and salt pan.

Healthy: Big cats, such as those relocated to Etosha by Donna and her team, help keep the springbok population in check and ensure only the strong breed

Safe: Etosha, one of the world's largest reserves, has been a haven for wildlife since 1907, when it was established by the German colonial authorities

The Africat Foundation is partially funded by guests staying at Okonjima Lodge. Exotic Travel and Safaris, which offers a 12-day tour that includes a night at the lodge and a chance to meet the animals at the reserve.

Packages include accommodation, meals and transfers, with prices starting at £1,874 per person. For more information, see exotictravelsafaris.com

South African Airways offers return flights to Windhoek from London Heathrow via Johannesburg from £1,010. See flysaa.com for more.

Those who can't be released go instead to the Okonjima Nature Reserve, a small stretch of land nestled among the Omboroko Mountains, which along with a small lodge, houses the AfriCat Foundation itself.

From Okonjima, Donna and her colleagues run a programme that encompasses the whole of Namibia and combines rescuing trapped wildlife with educating farmers and schoolchildren - much of it paid for using the proceeds of the on-site safari lodge.

'The secret to conservation is habitat,' explains Donna. 
'If you've got the space, animals make it, they survive. But we're also 
dealing with farmers that have to survive.

'They have to farm with 
leopards, cheetahs, elephants, spotted hyenas and brown hyenas and wild 
dogs whereas a farmer in Europe might at the most have to deal with a wolf of a bear. Or if they're in the UK, a fox.

'What we do is say to the farmer, "Take a week to come in Okonjima and we will show you how to keep the cattle safe without using traps or shooting the wildlife". We're trying to change their minds and methods - that's conservation.'

But while many have embraced the reforms championed by Donna and her team, others continue to take a harsher stance on dealing with wildlife - much to Donna's distress.

'The ugliest thing is the cruelty and the
 greed,' she says, sadly. 'To destroy nature as much as you can just for the benefit of your own pocket -
just so you can make as much money as you can.'

But that's not all. 'Cruelty is often a combination of 
ignorance and fear,' she continues. 'So people do horrible things to animals because they
 fear them, or because they don't realise, or ignore, the fact that animals get stressed.

'I've seen farmers keeping cheetahs in 
tiny cages in the baking, 50°C summer heat just to punish it for killing
 his calf. And then there's a new type of poaching, where people kill 
mothers just to take the babies and raise them like they saved them. 
Then, when they grow up, they sell them to hunting farms to be shot for 
money.'

Under threat: African Wild Dogs are increasingly endangered thanks to farmers who loathe them for their cruel method of killing their prey

Tracking: A team from Okonjima hunt for one of the cheetahs living onto the property. All are given electronic tags before being released

Relaxed: One of the tagged cheetahs at Okonjima relaxes in a patch of long grass after tucking into a springbok supper

Getting angry, she adds: 'It
should be classified alongside human trafficking and illegal arms trafficking. Poaching needs to be attacked by a government level. We 
can't fight that battle. Farmers earn so much money passing on trapped animals to the 
poachers, it's impossible for us to fight.'

And it's not just the big cats that suffer appalling cruelty. Whipping out a sheaf of photos, Donna runs through some of the other horrors she and her team have come across.

One shows a
 baby pangolin being turned into soup ('a cultural problem' says Donna),
 a truly ghastly image of a pair of horses being worked into exhaustion 
by two children and kicked when they fall over, an elephant lying 
bloated and tusk-less after being mutilated by poachers and a snap of 
two adult lions dead and bloody in a trap.

Clearly,
 there is much for Donna and her team to do. For all that, she remains 
hopeful about the future and says she hopes that one day, people will 
give Africa's wildlife the respect and protection it deserves.

'In
 all the years that we've been doing this, we've managed to talk to 
around five per cent of farmers. If we have managed to change the minds 
of just that five per cent, then we're already happy.

'But
 hopefully, with the rise of the internet, more people will find out 
about what's going on and fewer animals will be shot. Hopefully the next
 generation of farmers will realise that killing isn't fun and that it 
certainly isn't a solution to their problems.'

Education: One part of Donna's job involves teaching local children and farmers to appreciate the big cats with whom they share their lives

Long road: Although Donna and AfriCat have enjoyed some spectacular successes, she says there is still a very long way to go

Tiny: Jackals are also helped by AfriCat but suffer less at the hands of farmers, who don't see them as a huge threat to their livestock

More are at risk from farmers who fear for the lives of their animals if leopards, lions and cheetahs are around
