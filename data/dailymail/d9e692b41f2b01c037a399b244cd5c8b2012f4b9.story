Everton striker Romelu Lukaku has been ruled out of Belgium's forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers through injury.

Romelu Lukaku limped off in Sunday's 2-1 win at QPR with a hamstring problem which manager Roberto Martinez hoped would prove just to be cramp.

However, the Belgian Football Association has announced Lukaku and Anderlecht midfielder Steven Defour will not feature against Cyprus on Saturday or Israel the following Tuesday.

'@steven-defour35 & @RomeluLukaku9 are out for #belcyp & #isrbel,' said a message posted on Twitter by both the Belgian FA and coach Marc Wilmots.

Lukaku has played 44 matches for club and country this season, scoring 18 times in 42 appearances for Everton.

Reports have linked Wolfsburg, who Everton beat twice in the Europa League group stage, with a move for the striker but manager Roberto Martinez insists the Belgian international will not be leaving for the Bundesliga's second-placed side or any others.

'It has been impressive to see him grow in the last 10, 12 months and obviously we would love to see him grow with us in the long run. That would be the objective,' the Spaniard told the Liverpool Echo.

'The time he has been having with the team has been very impressive and we are going to see him develop into a special footballer.

'Romelu has been incredible and we made a big investment in him.

'He is only 21 and his goalscoring record is incredible, but I always highlight his attitude, day-to-day, and wanting to be the best.

'You are looking at a player now that can play Thursday and Sunday, he can take responsibility, he can take footballing concepts on.'
