British households will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners on Christmas Day, according to research.

The food we leave on our plates on December 25 adds up to to 263,000 turkeys, 740,000 Christmas puddings and 17.2 million Brussels sprouts across the UK, a study revealed.

Figures show that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away, which equates to an incredible £64million of wasted food.

Christmas wastage: Britons will throw away an incredible £64m in excess food on 25 December

The sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins, while leftover carrots could reach from London to Munich, end-to-end. And unused gravy would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

17.2m Brussels sprouts

11.9m carrots

11.3m roast potatoes

10.9m parsnips

9.8m cups of gravy

7.9m slices of turkey

7.9m cups of stuffing

7.5m mince pies

7.4m slices of Christmas pudding 

7.1m pigs in blankets

The poll by Unilever showed that whoever hosts Christmas lunch spends on average £112 on food alone. 

Typically, there are six of us around the Christmas dinner table and we're each expected to eat £18.60 worth of food. 

But it would take the average family nearly four days to eat everything bought just for Christmas Day.

The study also found a third of British diners admit to serving themselves an excessive Christmas dinner that they can't finish.

More than a third (36 per cent) of adults cite 'getting caught up in the Christmas spirit' as their excuse for buying too much food for the day.  

Under-35s are the worst culprits: 15 per cent  spend up to £200 on food but confess to discarding £27 worth each.

One in five of us admit to buying traditional Christmas food we don't even like, the study revealed.  

The research was carried out as part of Unilever's Project Sunlight #ClearAPlate campaign, to show that food poverty is closer to home than many people think.

Half a million meals will be provided to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam.

Jon Goldstone, Unilever Foods Director, said: 'We were shocked to hear just how much food goes to waste at Christmas. 

'The festive season is naturally a time when we indulge with our family and friends but throwing away 4.2 million perfectly good Christmas dinners is a staggering waste.

'Having seen these figures, this year I know I will be putting a little more thought into my Christmas shopping and through our #ClearAPlate campaign we're encouraging others to do the same.'

The #ClearAPlate campaign pledges to provide an additional half a million meals to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam and calls on people to do their bit to address food waste in order to help fight hunger.

People can show their support for the #ClearAPlate campaign through three simple steps:

• Clear their plate of food and take a photograph

• Upload the image on their social media using #ClearAPlate to raise awareness of the issue
