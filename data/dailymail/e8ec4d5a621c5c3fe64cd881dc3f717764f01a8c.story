An Australian man has been charged with brutally beating a 17-year-old girl in the Philippines and attempting to flee the scene.

Ali Ali, who has more than 100 criminal convictions in Victoria, was arrested in central Dumaguete City on the southern Negros Island on Sunday after an extensive search.

Police say he is responsible for savagely beating Alona Alvarez and leaving her naked body on the floor of a hotel room, reports The Age.

Alona Alvarez was found inside Antonio's Pension House, a hotel in Dipolog City, in a room that Ali had been renting since January 28

Ali, 42, told police Alvarez had bitten him on the genitals and had attacked her in a bid to get her teeth off his penis.

He is also facing drug charges after reportedly being found in possession of marijuana.

The teenager was found inside Antonio's Pension House, a hotel in Dipolog City, in a room that Ali had been renting since January 28.

A judge told Ali during the sentencing 'your assault was so extreme even experienced criminals were sickened by the conduct'.

Local police said Ali was arrested with a bandaged hand, which was likely injured when he was attacking his victim.

Ali completed a 15-year prison sentence for beating Tully so badly he was left in a wheelchair with brain damage

Ali was seen with the teenager on CCTV footage, as well as Facebook posts and money transfer receipts.

In one Facebook post, he wrote to her: '(sic) U can have anything you want. Your ambitions in time will happen.'  'im in love ali,' he said in another.

He had recently completed a 15-year prison sentence for beating a man so badly he was left in a wheelchair with brain damage.

It is believed that Australian custody officials are currently assisting Ali, who was initially non co-operative with police interviews.
