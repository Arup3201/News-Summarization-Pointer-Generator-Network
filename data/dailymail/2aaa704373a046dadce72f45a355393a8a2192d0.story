Kit Symons has been appointed Felix Magath's successor at Fulham and lands an 18-month contract.

The Cottagers' owner Shahid Khan flew back to London on Wednesday, with his caretaker boss given the job permanently straight away - as Sportsmail reported on Tuesday.

Symons has overseen five wins from his nine games in charge, leaving Khan with little choice but to promote the coach.

Khan said: 'First, I must offer my sincere appreciation to the search committee for its commitment to the process. We asked a lot of all five committee members, perhaps more than they anticipated, and yet they gave us more than we could have ever imagined. 

'Each of them brought something unique and valuable to the search, but the one thing they all had in common was a strong desire to return Fulham to its proper place as one of the most admired and respected clubs in English football. I cannot thank them enough.

'Kit has thoroughly earned the opportunity to take Fulham from here as our First Team Manager. We've been a different football club, on and off the pitch, since Kit stepped in as our Caretaker Manager in September. 

'His passion for Fulham is evident and contagious, and I believe the promise ahead of him is extremely bright. Above all, Kit understands and is committed to our goals, and he knows there is much work ahead. Starting today, we can begin work with Kit firmly in charge at Fulham.'

The 64-year-old was handed a trio of prospective new bosses by the five-man search committee installed to 'provide guidance' in their quest to find Magath's successor.

Danny Murphy, Brian McBride and Niall Quinn were alongside supporter and Nike director David Daly and academy boss Huw Jennings.

Symons took temporary charge at the back end of September with Fulham rooted to the foot of the Championship table. 

The caretaker boss has overseen five wins in eight games to lift Fulham out of the relegation zone

But his sterling transformation at Craven Cottage has seen his side's record only beaten by Bournemouth and Derby County in the month following. 

The odds of Hull City's Steve Bruce taking over from Magath had tumbled on Monday night but there was never anything in the link, while moves for ex-Premier League managers Chris Hughton and Steve Clarke were also mooted.
