For years it has been a village synonymous with one of Britain's most famous cheeses.

But while the Cambridgeshire village of Stilton may claim to be the home of the crumbly blue favourite, those who produce the cheese are bizarrely not allowed to use its famous name.

A current European Law ruling means Stilton cheese can only be produced by seven dairies in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.

Tradition: Cheese makes in Stilton, Cambridgeshire, have been banned from using the name for the famous cheese produced in their village

Famous: Stilton makes the most of its association with the famous cheese, and villagers are hoping to gain official recognition from Defra soon

The 'ridiculous' decision means that while the famous blue cheese can be made in Stilton, it has to go by the name Bell Blue.

Now, after last year finally winning the right to produce Stilton in their village at all, campaigners in Cambridgeshire want the right to call their product by its proper name.

The
current dispute over Stilton being able to use the cheese's name in its
own village stems in part from the historic blue's history.

Historical evidence suggests a cream cheese was being made and sold in and around Stilton in the late 17th century.

A
recipe for Stilton cheese was published in a newsletter by Richard 
Bradley in 1723, but no details were given on its size, shape, or how 
long it was matured.

In
1724 Daniel Defoe commented in his 'Tour through the villages of 
England & Wales' of Stilton being 'famous for cheese' and referred 
to the cheese as being the 'English Parmesan'.

A
later article by John Lawrence in 1726 suggested that the perfect 
Stilton should be... 'about 7 inches in diameter, 8 inches in height and
18 lbs in weight.'

As Stilton became a trading post between London and Edinburgh, the cheese was said to be sold to passing traders.

As demand for the cheese grew, its production moved to Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire.

It
was at this stage that the cheese's trademark blue veins became a part 
of the product, as it also became semi-hard blue cheese.

On Monday the village of Stilton applied to Defra for an extension of the protected designation of origin (PDO) for the cheese to cover their parish.

The village launched their campaign 
two days ago at the start of National Stilton Week 2012, and will boost 
their efforts by adding the phrase 'Original Home of Stilton Cheese' to a
sign outside their village.

Stilton
cheese is said by some to have got its name after being sold to 
travellers passing through the village in the 18th century.

Officials
in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, however, say Stilton was only a 
trade link and that the recipe was created in their county.

Stilton is officially recognised as 
coming from Leicestershire, and can only be produced there and in its 
two neighbouring counties following the PDO in 1996.

Liam McGivern, landlord of the Bell Inn in Stilton, makes a version of the cheese which until now he has had to call Bell Blue.

He said that not being able to call 
the cheese Stilton is 'embarrassing', especially given the tourist 
appeal that comes with the product.

He said: 'We get people coming in all the time saying, "Oh, can you direct me to the cheese factory?"

'If you asked 99 per cent of the population where the cheese comes from, they would say Stilton.'

The
campaign in Stilton has been created by various people and businesses 
in the village, and fronted by local historian Richard Landy.

He told the Peterborough Evening 
Telegraph: 'Since first being announced at last year’s Stilton Cheese 
Rolling event, this campaign has continued to gather momentum.

'We
have now fulfilled Defra’s requirements that we must be making the 
cheese, which we have been doing since 2011 and that it must be for 
commercial sale.

'They are the conditions that need to be satisfied before applying for an amendment to the PDO.'

Matthew
O'Callaghan, chairman of the Melton Mowbray Food Partnership, disputes 
whether blue Stilton was ever made in the village of the same name.

A
spokesperson for Defra said: 'To amend the geographical boundaries of 
an existing protected food, an applicant must first prove they are an 
interested party by showing they genuinely already make it commercially 
on a permanent, regular basis.

'We
would then carefully consider an application and if the claim was 
justified we would hold a UK-wide public consultation before making any 
decision.'

Association: Stilton has long enjoyed a link to the famous blue cheese, and even has an annual Stilton cheese rolling event through the village
