Swansea vs Liverpool (Liberty Stadium)

Team news

Swansea 

Bafetimbi Gomis should be available for Swansea's home game against Liverpool on Monday night after collapsing during the 3-2 defeat at Tottenham on March 4.

Gomis suffers from a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and prompts fainting episodes, but he returned to training on Wednesday after seeing a specialist in his native France and is expected to be given the all-clear to play at the Liberty Stadium.

Swansea manager Garry Monk has a full-strength squad to select from other than central defender Kyle Bartley, who remains unavailable following knee surgery.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Naughton, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Cork, Ki, Shelvey, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Gomis, Tremmel, Rangel, Amat, Fulton, Carroll, Britton, Montero, Dyer, Emnes, Oliveira, Grimes, King.

Liverpool 

Captain Steven Gerrard is back in contention for the trip to Swansea.

The veteran midfielder, who is leaving for Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season, has missed the last seven games with a hamstring injury.

Defenders Martin Skrtel (head) and Mamadou Sakho (hip) are expected to be fit but there could still be a doubt over midfielder Joe Allen (hip). Left-back Luis Enrique (knee) is back in training and could be back in contention soon.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Toure, Skrtel, Can, Markovic, Henderson, Allen, Moreno, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Ward, Lovren, Johnson, Sakho, Gerrard, Williams, Lambert, Balotelli, Borini, Sturridge.
