On Saturday afternoon in Brasilia, the host nation will walk out for a meaningless third place play-off in a World Cup they believed they were destined to win.

The five gold stars on those famous strips — one for each World Cup won by Brazil — will be an embroidered reminder of their failure.

These are footballers feted at home and abroad, paid millions in wages and endorsements, who live to play football in front of adoring fans. But on Saturday they would rather be anywhere else.

Devastation: A tearful David Luiz is comforted by Thiago Silva after the Germany result that shook Brazil

Shame: Brazil fans cannot believe their eyes as Germany record the unbelievable result against the hosts

They have become a shameful entry on a timeline of footballing greats that stretches back to Pele, Rivelino, Tostao, Garrincha, Falcao and Zico.

David Luiz, their inept captain on the night of the semi-final shame, Julio Cesar, Dante, Maicon, Marcelo, Fernandinho, Luis Gustavo, Hulk, Bernard, Fred and Oscar will be remembered for ever.

They are the team who shamed a nation. In the hours after Tuesday night’s annihilation, Brazil’s shell-shocked players drifted towards a team bus that has ‘the sixth is coming’ splashed down  the side.

Fred, the hapless striker who is a symbol for this sub-standard Brazil, admitted the 90-minute nightmare will never go away. ‘It is a scar that will forever live in all our lives,’ he said.

Luiz, his eyes red raw with emotion, said sorry to the Brazilian nation: ‘I just wanted to see my people smile.’

Mental scars: Most of these players, and Fred in particular, will never be forgiven for this defeat

Deep-rooted: Brazil's media blamed Luiz Felipe Scolari's team but Gilberto thinks the problems are bigger

Speechless: Fernandinho admitted that he has never experienced anything like the 7-1 defeat

‘We cannot find the words to explain this situation,’ admitted Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho.

There is talk of the psychological recovery within the Brazil camp and yet it will take more than a few visits to spiritualist Regina Brandao to soothe the pain.

‘We have three or four days to take some rest and think about the next game, but I’ve never experienced anything like it,’ added Fernandinho.

There were some obvious fissures in the team, particularly when Luiz Felipe Scolari — who won’t decide his future until after Saturday’s match —addressed his players in a huddle in the moments after the final whistle.

Many of them were snarling at each other before Scolari ordered them to applaud the Brazil supporters.

Misplaced passion: Brazil will have to go out and play again on Saturday in a game none of them will want

Scolari looked his 65 years, a man who won one World Cup in 2002 and lost another in 18 mad minutes.

‘It’s not easy to begin speaking about this,’ added Fernandinho.

There will be more tears and another rousing rendition of Hinero Nacional Brasileiro before the game they can’t play quickly enough.

It will be a very public shaming.
