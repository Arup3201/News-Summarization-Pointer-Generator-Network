A truck driver has described the moment he spotted a suspected trafficking victim peeking out of a van before a man got in and the vehicle 'started rocking'.

Kevin Kimmel was parked at a gas station in Richmond, Virginia, on January 6 when he witnessed the alleged incident and called police.

His call led to an FBI investigation after officers found a dishevelled 20-year-old woman who appeared to be malnourished with puncture wounds in her feet, according to a police report.

An Iowa couple, Aldair Hodza, 36, and Laura Sorensen, 31, have been charged with abducting the woman and forcing her into an online prostitution scheme.

Court documents allege Hodza tortured the woman by burning her with keys heated over a stove, and driving nails into her feet with a hammer.

Arrested: Iowa couple Aldair Hodza, 36, and Laura Sorensen, 31, have been charged with sex trafficking 

Recounting the moment he spotted the woman, Kimmel told WTVR: 'I saw what looked like a young girl looking out the window, the black drapes didn't make it look like a family's RV, you know.

'I saw a guy come up and knock on the door then go inside the Pilot [gas station] then quickly come back and knocked again.

'All of a sudden, the thing was rocking and rolling.'

The alleged victim told sheriff's deputies she was captured on Christmas Eve and forced into prostitution during a trip from Iowa to Virginia.

She added that Sorensen and Hodza threatened to kill her family if she spoke out, The News & Advance reported.

Officers found pictures of the alleged victim naked, bound and gagged.

Other pictures showed somebody spraynig Clorox bleach into an open wound.

Federal documents state the alleged victim was starved and denied water.

Sorensen allegedly sourced clients via the online market Craigslist, the site adds.

The couple are expected to appear in a Virginia Magistrate's court on Monday.

According to Iowa authorities, the woman was not reported missing.  

Kimmel said he was shocked when he heard the details of the investigation that his call led to. 

'When I saw the young girl's face, I said that's not going to happen, I've got daughters and granddaughters,' he told WTVR.

'I only learned the gruesome details through the news,' Kimmel told the station. 'I'm just happy I helped her.'
