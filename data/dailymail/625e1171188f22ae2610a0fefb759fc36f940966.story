Recluse: Huguette Clark's apartments are for sale

A trio of stunning New York apartments once owned by reclusive heiress Huguette Clark have gone on sale for $55million.

The flats, described as 'diamonds in the rough' requiring 'significant work', are said to be 'a time capsule from New York's Gilded Age'.

All located at 907 Fifth Avenue, 72nd Street, they have a combined 42 rooms - two of them taking up the 10,000 sq ft eighth floor and a 5,000 sq ft flat that takes up half of the top 12th floor.

They overlook Central Park's Conservatory Water, the sailboat pond where the mouse Stuart Little sailed in the EB White story, which is near the statute of Alice in Wonderland.

Their sale come as a legal battle over the 104-year-old's $400million estate begins - because she created two contrasting wills before her death in May last year.

The first, signed when she was 98, left almost everything to her family.

The second, made just six weeks later, made plans for an art museum in California, a $36million donation to her nurse and handed a $40million Monet to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.

Stunning: The apartments may need a bit of work, but pictures showing their former resplendence show how desirable they are

Central: The three flats are all in this building on New York's Fifth Avenue

It also detailed smaller gifts to her godchild, doctor, attorney and accountant - and led to her family accusing them of colluding to influence her will.

Money from the sale will first pay estate expenses, with the remainder going to the winner of the court battle.

Clark also owned a $100million ocean front estate in Santa Barbara, Californa, and a $24million country home in New Canaan, Conn.

Interior pictures of the apartments have not yet been released as Clark's possessions, including collections of dolls and fine paintings, are still being cleared.

Desirable: Apartment 8W is one of the two available on the eighth floor, with brokers saying that if the two were bought together they could be knocked into one super flat

Needs work: Interior pictures of the apartments are not yet available because Clark's possessions are still being removed

Spacious: The 12th floor apartment on Fifth Avenue has 5,000 sq ft of space but needs 'significant' updating

But floorplans for apartment 8E, 8W 
and 12W, which previously had a value of $70million, have been put out 
by brokers Brown Harris Stevens.

Clark
has been the subject of intense speculation ever since she was born, 
having rarely ever appeared in public. The last photograph was taken of 
her more than 80 years ago.

She spent the final 20 years of her life in various New York hospitals, while paying more than $300,000 every 12 months for the upkeep of the properties.

Born in Paris in 1906, she was the 
youngest child of U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark, who was known as 
one of the copper kings.

Family: U.S. Senator William A. Clark, centre, joins his daughter, Huguette, at the Easter Parade in New York. He left her billions of dollars when he died

Media interest: The Clark family have always 
been the subject of media speculation, particularly Huguette in recent 
years as many were fascinated by her reclusive lifestyle

He was America's second richest man in the early 1900s behind John D Rockefeller.

He shocked the political and financial
world when he was 62 by announcing in 1908 he had secretly married two 
years earlier and that his 23-year-old wife already had a two-year-old 
daughter.

Huguette married 
in 1928, at 22, to William Gower, a law student and Clark family 
employee. But the couple soon separated, had no children, and divorced 
in less than two years, in the summer of 1930.

War of wills: Huguette Clark's first document 
was signed by her in March 2005 (left) before she made another will six 
weeks later

When Huguette's father died in 1925, his millions were divided equally between his children from both his marriages.

Clark and her mother moved into the building shortly after because their 121 room family home at 962 Fifth Avenue was being demolished.

It had the most expensive apartments in the city. When his daughter turned 21, she received $300million or $3.6billion in today's money.

Vacant: The mysterious Clark estate in Santa Barbara, which has been empty since 1963. It is worth more than $100 million
