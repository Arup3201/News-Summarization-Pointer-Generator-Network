A 27-year-old woman and three of her sons were killed as they crossed a busy road in Philadelphia last night.

Police are investigating whether the driver who hit Samara Banks and her family had been drag racing at the time of the collision at about 10.30pm.

Ms Banks, who was crossing the road with four of her children, was killed by the car, along with her 23-month-old son Saa'sean.

Her nine-month-old baby Saa'mir died after reaching hospital and her four-year-old son Saa'deemÂ  died in the early hours of today, according to Philly.com.

Her five-year-old son Saa'yon suffered cuts and bruises but is expected to recover from his injuries.

The family were about 6ft from the sidewalk when an Audi, driven by a 22-year-old who has not yet been named, hit them with such force that it knocked Ms Banks 200ft.

The day care worker had been walking home with her sons after visiting an aunt. Relatives gathered at the side of the road at about midnight, after hearing of the tragic deaths.

Ms Banks, who had helped raise her sister and three brothers after their mother died seven years ago, took her own sons everywhere with her, always insisting that they hold hands.

'That's why all of them got hit,' Nicole Holmes, one of her cousins, said.

'She was a beautiful person and she loved her kids,' Rose Williams, Ms Banks's aunt, said. 'That's why they were all with her.'

As relatives gathered at her home to comfort each other, they remembered Ms Banks as a good parent who always made sure her children were well-behaved and happy, and loved taking them on trips to the zoo and library.

Police Chief Inspector Scott Small said authorities are investigating whether cars had been drag racing at the time of the accident.

Police are investigating statements from witnesses who claimed to have seen the driver racing with another motorist.

'We're talking to several persons who witnessed this accident - some who were on foot, some who were in other vehicles when the accident occurred,' he told Fox News.

Tributes: Family and friends leave notes and teddy bears next to the busy road where the family died

Ms Banks had been trying to get her children across the busy road, which does not have a crosswalk or street lights.

The driver, who stayed at the scene, was taken in for questioning and drink and drug tests, but police said he appeared to be sober.

No charges have been filed yet, according to Philly.com.
