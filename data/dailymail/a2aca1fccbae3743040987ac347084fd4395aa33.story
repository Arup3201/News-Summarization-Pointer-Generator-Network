A stuntman died yesterday during a world record attempt as he tried to cross a river on a zip-wire attached only to his hair.

Sailendra Nath Roy, 50, was half way through the stunt when his ponytail became stuck in the wheeler of the rope and he was left hanging in mid-air for about 25 minutes.

Despite desperate attempts to free himself, it is believed Mr Roy then suffered a major cardiac arrest and died.

Mr Roy, a West Bengal Police home guard, already held the Guinness world record for the farthest distance travelled on a zip wire using his hair.Â 

About 1,000 people turned out to see him try and break the record over the Teesta River in Darjeeling, which is almost 10,000ft above sea level, when the freak accident happened.

Mr Roy attempted to free himself after his ponytail became caught in the wheeler and then tried to continue the crossing using only his hands.

However, local media said he then suffered a massive cardiac arrest.

Rescuers brought him down from the Coronation Bridge about 45 minutes later.

He was taken to a nearby hospital but was declared dead on arrival.

Onlookers said spectators had initially failed to realise Mr Roy was in trouble because of the cheers coming from the crowd.

The stuntman had held several Guinness world records for pulling vehicles with his hair.

He attracted global attention last year when he dragged a 42-tonne train for 2.5metres.

In 2011, he travelled 270ft on a zip wire, which he was attached to by his hair.

Siliguri police commissioner K. Jairaman said Roy had not acquired the necessary permission for the stunt, adding that Roy was not on duty at the time of his death.
