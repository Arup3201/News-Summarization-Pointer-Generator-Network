Chloe Madeley is helping to raise awareness for the important issue of cervical cancer... by stripping down to her underpants.

The body-confident 25-year-old daughter of TV presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan is supporting upcoming Cervical Screening Awareness Week by modelling underwear from Sainsburyâ€™s clothing range, Tu.

In turn, the supermarket giant will be donating 50p from the sale of every pair of Tu knickers sold next week to Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, a charity providing support and information to those affected by cervical cancer.

Chloe said: 'I want everyone to 
understand the importance of cervical screening and get one booked in if
they are overdue. Screening only takes five minutes, but the impact of 
cervical cancer can last a lifetime'

Chloe, who came third in Dancing On Ice in 2011 and has since then developed an enthusiastic fondness for staying in shape, has a particular reason to be attached to the charity, having recently had 
treatment for pre-cancerous cells.

She said: 'It was a scary time 
for me, but I am so glad I got it sorted as soon as I knew there was a 
problem and cervical abnormalities were spotted.

'I want everyone to 
understand the importance of cervical screening and get one booked in if
they are overdue. Screening only takes five minutes, but the impact of 
cervical cancer can last a lifetime.'

A keen gym-goer, Chloe is very focused on staying healthy in all ways.

The young presenter is frequently to be found on Twitter, posting photographs of herself and her personal trainer boyfriend Danny Young in sporting gear, or doing sit-ups in the kitchen.

Cervical cancer is a preventable disease thanks to the National Screening Programme, which saves around 5,000 lives every year.

Cervical Screening Awareness Week, held over the 9-15 June this year, is a
UK wide initiative lead by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust - the only UK 
charity dedicated to women and their families affected by cervical 
cancer and cervical abnormalities.

The week aims to highlight the 
importance of cervical screenings, known as smear tests, and how attending a screening 
invitation can help to prevent cervical cancer.

Robert Music, Director of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said: 'We're 
delighted that Sainsbury's is supporting the charity and putting the 
spotlight on cervical screening.

'Every day in the UK nine women are 
diagnosed with cervical cancer and three will die from the disease.

'With
20 per cent of women still not attending their cervical screening, raising 
public awareness of cervical cancer prevention is still a priority.

'Public knowledge and understanding of issues such as cervical screening,
the causes of cervical abnormalities and cervical cancer, as well as 
treatment, is generally low.'

Toni-Ann Lindsay, Head of Lingerie Buying for Sainsbury's said: 'We are delighted to be supporting Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust and help raise awareness about the importance of cervical screening.

'In a bid to raise awareness of the charity, we will be donating 50p from every pair of knickers sold during that week. We sell one pair every three seconds so we're hoping to raise an impressive sum.'

Cervical smear tests are crucial for the prevention of cervical cancer

Every year in the UK, over 3,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and nearly 1,000 women will die from the disease.

Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under.

Cervical cancer is not thought to be hereditary. Cervical cancer, in 99.7 per cent of cases, is caused by persistent infection with a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV).

HPV is a very common virus transmitted through skin to skin contact in the genital area. Around four out of five people (80 per cent) will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives.

However, for the majority of women this will not result in cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is rare while HPV infection is common.

Each year around five million women in the UK are invited for cervical screening (smear test). Cervical screening is not a test to find cancer, it is a screening test to detect abnormalities (pre-cancer) at an early stage in the cells in the cervix.

Cervical screening is the process of taking a sample of cells from your cervix which are then examined to detect abnormalities that might develop into cancer in the future.

The sample of cells is placed in liquid so that it can be analysed in the laboratory. This process is called liquid based cytology (LBC).

Screening can detect precancerous/abnormal cells and the detection and successful treatment of these cells usually prevents the occurrence of cancer.

Changes in these cells are generally caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV).

Testing for the HPV virus itself can also be done on the same LBC sample that is examined under the microscope, although at the moment this is not done routinely on all samples in the UK.

Regular cervical screening provides a high degree of protection against developing cervical cancer and is offered free on the NHS. It is estimated that early detection and treatment through cervical screening can prevents up to 75% of cervical cancers from developing in the UK [2]. Not going for cervical screening is one of the biggest risk factors for developing cervical cancer.
