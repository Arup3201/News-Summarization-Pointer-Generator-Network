Last week, a snappy Facebook post from a narky bride-to-be went viral, in which the woman writes a list telling her Facebook friends, in no uncertain terms, exactly 'why you're not invited to our wedding.'

The list of reasons in the rude rant include 'if your (sic) only going to show up for food and alcohol and really have no reason other than that' and 'If at any point you have ever talked s**t about me... your (sic) definitely not invited.'

But according to a Sydney-based wedding planner, bridezillas are not a rare breed - they are everywhere and they can be terrifying.

‘There are a lot of crying women in the wedding-planning process. It’s all just part of the job,’ said Fiona Deans-Dundas of Couture Wedding Planning.

'It can be a stressful time, sometimes they need to have a couple of tanties or a good cry to get all the anger out.'

According to Sydney-based wedding planner Fiona Deans-Dundas, bridezillas are not a rare breed... They are everywhere and even the loveliest of woman can lose their minds during the wedding planning process

‘Lots of brides do get quite frustrated and aggravated and can take it out on people quite badly, but I don’t think they even realise that they are doing it at the time.'

This is where the wedding planner comes in, keeping the worst of the bridezilla behaviour at bay.

‘The smaller things can really get to the girls. You have those times when you feel like you’re looking at three almost-identical shades of pink for a little bit too long, or worrying because the chair sash doesn’t match the flower colour or something a little bit mad like that.

'You have requests and think to yourself, ‘flowers are natural things, you can’t order flowers in a specific colour shade!’ But, it’s our job to find solutions,’ explains the ever-patient Mrs Deans-Dundas.

‘You often hear horror stories from people that work in the wedding industry and it’s really scary. During the process, brides can lose it. I’m always careful when I choose clients or that could be my reality!' laughs Mrs Dundas-Deans.

Mrs Deans-Dundas says that she is very wary of bridezillas and has learnt how to pick them out when she first meets with the future brides.

‘I try to weed out the bridezillas in the preliminary interviews. There are a lot of warning signs in that first meeting - if they’re already hard work at that stage, it’s going to be a long 18 months.’

But even the most down-to-earth, amiable women can crack under the pressure.

‘Each girl can get quite stressed before their wedding and can have their own bridezilla moments. When that happens you realise that the pressure is getting to them.

‘I choose to work with clients that I click with in the first meeting. I know that way we’ll have a great relationship. But everyone can get very stressed and stop thinking rationally,' said Mrs Dundas-Deans.

The strain of the organising the nuptials means the wedding planner often bears the brunt of the client's stress.

Mrs Dundas-Deans isn't surprised that the bride lost her cool over invitations, because she's seen it happen many a time.

'One of the most stressful parts of planning a wedding are the invitations. There’s so much information to need to get right, lots of details to have to get right and the couple have to rely on people to give them addresses in time. I find it’s at that point that cracks begin to show sometimes.

'If a bride is potentially going to get stressed, it’s also probably going to happen about two weeks before the wedding. Girls get very emotional and that’s when it’s the wedding planner’s job to be their best friend, to come up with solutions and let them know everything’s going to be okay!

Wedding planner Fiona Deans-Dundas says that sometimes the pressure becomes too much for brides and that 'sometimes a few tanties or a good little cry is a good way to get the anger out'

The seasoned wedding planner admits she had a bridezilla moment in the lead up to her big day.

'Even I remember crying on the week of my wedding! I cried over an issue with the ceremony booklets… But once the tantrum was done realised that no one cared about it except for me!’

Mrs Deans-Dundas says a wedding planner's job is to help the event run smoothly and juggle the expectations of the many people involved.

‘For the wedding planner, I think it’s just a matter of making everyone happy. The trickiest part of the job isn’t just the brides, there are a lot of expectations to manage. Parents and people close to them have a lot of opinions too and can become quite precious. It’s important to become the negotiator and friend to make everyone happy at the end of the day.'

Despite the challenges, Mrs Deans-Dundas says 'it's a really fantastic job and I love my brides.'

'Being patient is a super important trait for a wedding planner. You have to be organised and a great listener, to listen to what people want.

'No matter what happens, you just have to always be upbeat and friendly and build great relationships with the brides.'

'The bride has a lot of expectations. How they'll feel on the day, how they'll feel in their dress, what their wedding's going to be like. We need to help them make it happen.'
