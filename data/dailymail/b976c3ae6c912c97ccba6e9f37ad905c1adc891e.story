When Tony Blair made a low-key visit to Burma last October and met political leaders, including pro-democracy heroine Aung San Suu Kyi, it was said the trip was to boost ‘bilateral ties with Britain’.

Now The Mail on Sunday has been told the former Prime Minister has won permission to expand his ever-growing personal empire known as Tony Blair Inc to Burma.

Diplomatic sources say he has been helped by his growing contacts with the China Investment Corporation, the global commercial wing of the Beijing regime – although Mr Blair’s office last night played this down.

It is the latest stage in Mr Blair’s remarkable career since leaving Downing Street in 2007 that has seen him maintain his influence and build a fortune estimated at £20 million in his dual role as international statesman and entrepreneur.

His success in winning permission to extend his activities to Burma is a major diplomatic and business coup. Since sanctions against the country were dropped last year, foreign firms have been in a race to get there.

Burma is rich in oil, natural gas and other mineral resources and its impressive economic growth of more than five per cent a year is expected to be accelerated by more foreign money.

The ‘gold rush’ follows reforms, including Aung San Suu Kyi’s release from house arrest two years ago, by the military junta that has ruled Burma since a coup  in 1962.

Neither Mr Blair nor the Burmese revealed full details about his October visit, during which he also met President Thein Sein.

Days earlier, when Mr Blair visited Vietnam, China’s government-run news agency Xinhua was more forthcoming. It said he wanted to ‘share his experiences in restructuring economy and attracting investment’, among other things. It seems likely Mr Blair will be willing to offer the same advice to the Burmese.

In addition to his standing as a statesman, he had another major advantage in securing a foothold in Burma: his close links with CIC, responsible for investing Beijing’s £300 billion reserves abroad.

Mr Blair has made more than ten trips to China in two-and-a-half years, meeting representatives of CIC, and has developed close links with its chairman, Lou Jiwei. China has long-standing links with Burma’s rulers and ignored the trade sanctions imposed by Britain and other nations.

As Prime Minister, Mr Blair was a fierce opponent of Burma’s regime and signed a pledge not to travel there while the junta was in power.

Last April, after Aung San Suu Kyi’s pro-democracy party won a landslide election victory, David Cameron became the first Western leader to visit Burma. Trading restrictions imposed by the West were eased shortly afterwards.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘We are simply having wide-ranging discussions with the government on the development of the country because Mr Blair is interested in it.

‘He has no commercial interests in Burma, and if he does do any governance work there it will be pro bono. Our discussions do not involve the Chinese Investment Corporation and we do not have a commercial engagement with the CIC.’
