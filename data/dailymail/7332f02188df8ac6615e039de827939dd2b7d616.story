Their husbands and boyfriends are away serving their country.

And these glamorous military WAGs are determined to give them a taste of home.

Twelve women, whose partners are all commandos, have posed for a calendar in an attempt to raise thousands for the Royal Marines.

Gracing the front cover as Queen Britannia is 21-year-old Miss November, Chelsea, of Weymouth in Dorset.

The hairdresser, who has been with her partner for three years, said: 'It's very exciting to be the cover girl and I hope my marine loves the pictures.

'In August 2011 he lost his cousin who was also a serving Royal Marine.

'I applied for the calendar not only to raise money but to do something amazing for myself. It has been a real privilege and honour. It makes me very proud to be British.'

Wrestling a British boxer dog in her shoot, Sian, 30, said: 'I've raised almost £30,000 for Royal Marine Charities in his memory, I wanted to do something for myself whilst raising money for a cause so close to my heart.

'Doing the calendar has brought back some confidence and I can't wait to be an official pin-up girl. Paul would be very proud of this opportunity I've been given, everything I am doing is in honour of him.'

The annual Royal Marines WAGs calendar was conceived in 2011 and inspired by saucy photos the women send to their men serving abroad.

Last year it raised £5,000 for the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund, which aims to give a better quality of life to marines and their families.

Organisers Jenny Robey and Becci Parriss said the girls were chosen for a mixture of their looks and their own personal backstories.

The 2015 edition is available online.
