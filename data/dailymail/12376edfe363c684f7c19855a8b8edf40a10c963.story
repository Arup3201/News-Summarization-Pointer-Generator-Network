It seems men think they know everything they need to about a woman's pleasure in the bedroom, but ladies have other ideas.

A new study shows many men are confident regarding their knowledge of a woman's sexuality, but far fewer women vouch for their expertise.

Two thirds (65 per cent) of blokes boast about their knowledge of a woman's desires, but women think they have a thing or two to learn as less than half (49 per cent) agree.

And they must be on to something as 50 per cent of male respondents struggled to successfully locate the G-spot - and 23 per cent were even unable to locate the clitoris.

Moreover, 20 per cent of men believe that the G-spot location varies from woman to woman, and 3 per cent were honest and said that they did not know.

Regarding erogenous zones, 33 per cent of men believe that they vary from one woman to the next. Many, dumbfounded, were unable to muster an answer at all.

The survey proves that it's time to learn the basics, and (luckily) men seem eager to discover more about the female body.

Men think women fake orgasms and masturbate more than they actually do

A
 significant 75 per cent said they would be open to being taught more 
about women's sexuality in order to increase satisfaction within their 
couple.

The imbalance continues between couples when 39 per cent of men and 42 per cent of women say that the most effective way for a woman to orgasm is clitoral stimulation.

However, when asked whether 'size matters' only 4 per cent of men say that's the case, and that 'penetration is a must for her pleasure', while a more significant 20 per cent of women agree to this statement.

Perhaps 
men need a little more encouragement, though, as 37 per cent of men 
believe that their partner fakes orgasm once every three times.

Just 16 per cent of women say they've faked it.

Men
 also think women get themselves off more than they actually do. All men
 think women masturbate at some point - but almost a quarter of women 
(22 per cent) say they never do.

A spokesperson for Soft Paris, who conducted the research, said: 
'The results are counter intuitive and very surprising.

'It seems there 
is a lack of communication between the two sexes and a huge discrepancy 
with what men and women think. Women's sexuality is even more complex 
than we originally thought... and men still don't get it.

'Soft Paris 
want to help improve communication and therefore people's sexual 
relationships.'

The research marks the launch of home parties for couples - a brand new concept from Soft Paris

The research marks the launch of the leading French lingerie and boudoir label's home parties for couples - a brand new concept.

Called Les Amants (The Lovers), they involve a representative coming to your home (much like an Ann Summers party - but with your lover in attendance) and presenting erotic accessories and 
intimate toys.

The advisor will shows the host and her guests how to use them 
playfully and creatively in order to ignite sexual energy within a 
relationship.

In addition, the knowledgeable female salesperson will share sex and seduction tips and secrets, to help couples please each other better in the bedroom.

The themed party 
was created in response to the company's home sales advisors seeing a 
growing trend for men asking to have Soft Paris' secrets shared with 
them, so they can know their partner better, and reach a new stage in 
their sensual wellbeing as a couple.
