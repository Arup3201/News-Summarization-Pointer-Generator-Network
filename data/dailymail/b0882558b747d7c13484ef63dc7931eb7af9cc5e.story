A doctor who left a glove inside a patient has admitted she was using a surgical technique she learned by watching a DVD.

An investigation was carried out by the Royal Derby Hospital after Sharon Birks found the glove inside her body three days after surgery to remove her womb.

It emerged a member of the team involved in the operation decided to use the glove as part of the surgical procedure.

Sharon Birks, 42, had a hysterectomy at the Royal Derby Hospital and three days later, when she went to the toilet, she discovered a surgical glove had been left inside her body

But the female registrar had only learned about the technique on a course she attended in India weeks earlier and from watching a DVD which had discussed it, a report said.

The use of the latex surgical glove, which was supposed to have been removed before the end of the operation, was not an ‘accepted technique’ at the Royal Derby or one used routinely in the UK.

And the report said the registrar, who has not been named, did not tell anyone else in the operating theatre what she had done, which meant the glove was not taken out.

A horrified Mrs Birks, 42, later discovered the glove when she went to the toilet.

Now, the mother-of-six, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, is taking legal advice after seeing the investigation report compiled by the hospital trust.

Mrs Birks said: ‘Reading the report was horrible because I can’t believe the registrar was able to do something like this and no-one knew.

‘It’s so hard to understand how this 
could have happened. At first, I was just numb about the whole thing but
 it made me very angry.’

Mrs Birks, a learning disability support worker, was admitted to the hospital last November for a hysterectomy.

A registrar has now admitted she put the glove inside Mrs Birk while practicing a surgical technique she had learned from a DVD

The report said that during the surgery the surgeon leading the operation said his view inside her body was impaired because the air pumped inside her abdominal cavity had been lost.

The report said the registrar decided to request clean gloves and insert one of them into her body.

It said: ‘As part of the investigation, the registrar informed us that she had attended a training course in November 2013 at the World Laparoscopy Hospital, in Guragon, Delhi, and had used an online training DVD, both of which had discussed the use of the glove to maintain pneumoperitoneum – [gas or air in the abdominal cavity].’

It added: ‘[The glove was inserted] with no communication to any of the theatre team. However, the technique did work for this lady and pnuemoperitoneum was achieved.’

The report said telling colleagues when items had been inserted into the body was ‘part of basic theatre practice’ and if the registrar had told a colleague about the glove, it would have been ‘accounted for at the end of surgery’.

It said: ‘The registrar recognises that she made a mistake with good intention and, through this, she has learned the importance of good communication.’

The investigation also found a letter put together for Mrs Birks’ GP after her surgery said she had undergone a ‘straightforward procedure’ with ‘no problems at discharge’.

It said this letter had been dictated by a junior doctor not involved in Mrs Birks’ care and a further letter with full details was sent to the GP two weeks later.

Two recommendations were made in the report - for both the consultant gynaecologist and registrar to ‘reflect on communication, especially while in theatre’ and for consultant-led spot checks on discharge letters.

Mrs Birks said: ‘I didn’t feel well 
enough to go home at first but I just assumed the pain was normal and 
part of the process. I’m glad I was still in hospital when it happened 
but I just keep thinking: “What gave her the right to do this?”’

The doctor, at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), learned the technique in India a few weeks before Mrs Birk's operation. It wasn't standard procedure in this country and she didn't tell her colleagues what she was doing

Mrs Birks said she soon felt fully fit again after the glove was removed. The report said ‘no adverse health outcomes’ were expected as a result of her experience.

Derby Hospitals Foundation Trust would not name the registrar or say if she still worked for the organisation.

But a spokeswoman for the trust said: ‘We are extremely sorry for the distress that was caused to Mrs Birks.

‘Clearly, this should not have happened and, as soon as managers were made aware, we launched a detailed investigation.

‘The findings of this investigation have been shared with Mrs Birks and her husband, who have had a meeting with the chief executive and senior medical and nursing executives.

The hospital has apologised to Mrs Birk and her family and has carried out a full investigation (file picture)

‘Mrs Birks was given an opportunity to ask questions and she was given a full explanation and a further apology.

‘This is a confidential report which has been shared with Mrs Birks. We are not able to go into further detail.

‘At every stage, we have been frank and honest with Mrs Birks and we have repeated our unreserved apologies for the human error which led to this distressing and unpleasant experience.

‘We take patient safety extremely seriously and we have put measures in place to ensure that lessons are learned from this very unfortunate, but thankfully unique, incident.’
