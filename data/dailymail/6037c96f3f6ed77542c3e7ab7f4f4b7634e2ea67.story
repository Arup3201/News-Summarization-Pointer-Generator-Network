A nine-year-old schoolgirl has been hailed a hero after diving into a freezing canal to save a young boy from drowning.

Caoimhe Preshur, from Saddleworth, Oldham, was on a canal boating holiday in Sheffield with her family when she saw the 10-year-old boy fall into the ice cold water.

The boy - known only as Thomas - was walking along the deck of a narrow boat when he slipped and fell in to the canal.

Caoimhe, who is a pupil at Greenfield Primary School, heard the boy's screams and immediately dived into the cold murky water and swam across to help him.

She grabbed hold of the boy and held his head above water until family members arrived to help.

Caoimhe told an online news website: 'I 
heard a scream and ignored it at first as there were children playing 
nearby, but when I heard a second scream I realised somebody was in 
trouble.

'I ran over to the side of the boat and saw Thomas bobbing around in the water screaming he was going to die.

'I put my hand out but he wouldn't grab it - he was panicking too much- so I jumped in and just kept him afloat.

'I'm
quite a good swimmer as I go swimming twice a week so I wasn't too 
worried about the cold water, all I remember is me and him grabbing the 
boat to try and keep ourselves above the water.

'I was really just 
concentrating on stopping him from drowning.'

Caoimhe's
mum, Abi Bown, said she was proud of her daughter and was on hand to make sure the youngsters were warmed up with a cup of hot chocolate after the rescue.

She said: 'I ran across after I heard screams and saw them 
both in the water but I couldn't get them out, I literally had to tow 
them to the front of the narrow boat which allowed us to pull them back 
up to the deck.

'We dried them both off and gave them a hot chocolate to drink.

Mike Wood, headmaster of Greenfield Primary School, described Caoimhe's actions as 'remarkable' and the pupil was praised during her school assembly.

He said: 'Caoimhe hadn't told anyone at school about what she had done.

'We
are very proud of her and she obviously used common sense during the 
rescue, with no one around to help she jumped in with no thought for her
own safety.

'She must have been confident in her ability before she went in to keep Thomas afloat.

'We are all just so proud of her doing that in an icy cold canal it's remarkable.

'We have talked to the children this morning in assembly about what she did and she should be given some recognition for this, she's a lovely little girl.'

Thomas later told Caoimhe she had 'saved his life' and he was very grateful to her.
