Masked smash-and-grab robbers fled with £30,000-worth of jewellery from a Birmingham store - in a raid that lasted just 48 seconds.

CCTV footage shows the gang smashing their way into Selective Gold with sledgehammers and destroying display cabinets in front of terrified staff and customers.

The robbers packed £80,000 worth of jewellery into two large bags before running out of the shop - all in under a minute.

One of the customers in the shop at the time of the raid bravely snatched back one of the bags the robbers had filled, which contained £50,000 worth of jewellery

Owner John Davis said his business was 
only saved by a customer who bravely snatched back a bag that contained 
jewellery worth around £50,000 as the robbers fled.

The 57-year-old grandfather, who released the CCTV footage, said: 'I have worked hard building up the business and have not taken a holiday in three years.

'You do all that and somebody comes in and snatches everything in just 48 seconds.

'The first we knew something was happening was when we heard two massive bangs at the door.

'It was mayhem in the minute that followed and I pleaded with them to not take the jewellery.

'I said they may as well kill me because the last few years have been really tough. I said: "Please don’t do this, it will ruin me" but they didn’t care.

'The customer who grabbed the bag from them effectively kept me in business.

Grandfather John Davis, who has been in the jewellery trade for 40 years, said that the customer who grabbed the bag from the robbers had effectively kept his shop Selective Gold (left) in business

'The police took the bag to check for forensics and we only found out what was in it when it was handed back. It turned out to be the most valuable bag they had.

'Had they escaped with it, £30,000-worth of losses would have turned into £80,000. It was a very brave thing for him to do.

'Without the bag I would have had to shut the shop. I think he saw how stressed I was and he made an instinctive grab for it.'

The robbers broke into the store in the city's Jewellery Quarter at 10.40am on August 26.

Father-of-two Mr Davis, who has been in the trade for more than 40 years, said he was now terrified the raiders would return.

Shop owner Mr Davis, a father-of-two, described how the robbers packed two large bags with jewellery in under 48 seconds. He said he has had to increase his security since the raid

He said: 'I wish there was more security in the area for traders. The police station has closed, but this is a high-risk area.

'I have had to increase my own security measures. I assume a lot is going on in the background with the police investigation, but I have heard nothing from them.

'As well as the financial loss the other big issue is the lasting impact. You are always on edge and worried it will happen again, but I just have to plod on with what I have left.'
