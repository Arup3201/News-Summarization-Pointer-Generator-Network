The shocking Alps massacre was dismissed as nothing more than a trivial news item by the French media.

Despite the terrifying nature of the killings - and the horrific discovery that a four-year-old girl had been left under her family's corpses in the car for eight hours - the country's journalists paid little attention to the events.

For newspapers and news networks in France the execution-style slayings of the al-Hilli family constitute what is known as a 'fait divers' - a term used to describe a trivial news item.

Not newsworthy? The bullet-riddled BMW where the al-Hilli family were discovered

News of the cold-blooded multiple murders
 emerged well in time for newspaper deadlines on both sides of the 
Channel, but only British papers carried it on their front pages on 
Thursday.

Centre-right daily Le Figaro reported the story only on page eight, while leftwing paper Liberation relegated the shocking story to page 14.

Even when one of the victims was on Friday named as French local Sylvain Mollier, a father of three, only local papers and national tabloid Aujord'hui put the story on the front page.

Aeronautical engineer Saad al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal, 47, a dentist, and his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were discovered dead at a remote beauty spot near the village of Chevaline, by Lake Annecy, last Wednesday.

Each was shot twice in the head in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire thought to have lasted around 30 seconds.

Also in the car were the couple's daughters Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, who both survived the attack.Â 

Seriously injured Zainab was just yesterday brought out of a medically induced coma and is recovering in hospital in Grenoble after being shot in the shoulder and pistol-whipped.

Her younger sister, who hid for hours beneath the skirt of her dead mother, returned to the UK yesterday in the care of relatives.

Aujourd'hui wrote in an article how the British Press had been 'sarcastic' about the efforts and methods of local police, who took eight hours to realise Zeena was alive and hiding in the car.

According to the Guardian, the paper 
added that the distrust was not entirely misplaced since French police 
had been responsible for 'several legal or administrative fiascoes after
 the murder of British citizens on French soil.'

France's
 most watched news network BFM TV hailed the British Press's 'race for 
information' which turned up the first photos of the dead man, his car 
and details of his family.

Particularly perplexed by British journalists' insatiable appetite for detail was public prosecutor Eric Maillaud.

'Why is that important?' he replied more than once to forensic questioning at the ends of Fleet Street reporters at daily press conferences, the Guardian reported.

'Maybe some people saw Martians. I really don't know,' he reportedly answered journalists badgering him about what witnesses may or may not have seen.
