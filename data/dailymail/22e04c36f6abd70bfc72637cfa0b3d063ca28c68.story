A pensioner was forced to spend £600 clearing his name after a tram fare dodger 50 years his junior fraudulently used his name and address on three separate occasions. 

Jim McMahon, 76, from Lydgate, Greater Manchester, endured months of stress and had to fork out for a solicitor after being falsely accused of dodging a fare on the Manchester tram network.

It later emerged that an imposter - believed to be known to Mr McMahon - had been stopped three times in August last year, but had falsely given a name and address connected to Mr McMahon.

He said: ‘All this stress has come on top of a recent hospital operation I have had and I really haven’t needed this on top of it all.

‘I intend to try to get some money back from Metrolink or Bury Magistrates for my inconvenience.'  

On all the occasions, the culprit had given McMahon's full name, alongside his daughter's address.

He twice gave his date of birth as 1978 and once as 1988, despite the fact Mr McMahon was born in 1939.   

Afterwards, a fine notice was  sent to Mr McMahon, who proved that he did not live at the given address and that he was not travelling on the tram at the time.

Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), which is responsible for Metrolink, subsequently dropped two of the fines.

But Mr McMahon was shocked when he received a letter at his daughter's address, summoning him to Bury Magistrates' Court over the third incident.   

When he contacted police to reiterate he was not the culprit, he was advised to write a letter to the court and Metrolink operator MRDL to explain. He expected the third fine to also be dropped.

But the court case still went ahead and Mr McMahon was given a £310 fine in his absence. 

He said: 'Surely, the best thing for Metrolink to do, given that there were two other instances where my name had been falsely given, is to contact me to check before dragging me through the courts in a battle that has cost me close to £600.

‘When I have already made it clear that I do not live in this property, why is it my responsibility to prove I’m innocent once again?’  

After that, Mr McMahon hired a solicitor who arranged for him to go to Oldham Magistrates' Court to appeal the conviction. 

But, during the hearing, Mr McMahon said he was not given a chance to explain what had happened. Instead, another hearing was arranged in which a trial date was due to be set.

He said: ‘I had been told I had to go to Oldham Magistrates' Court where I had to wait for a full day before I was told to make a statutory declaration.

‘I wanted to explain why I wasn’t guilty. But they didn’t give me the chance.’ 

Mr McMahon decided not to go along to the next hearing, on the advice of his solicitor.

It was only when he phoned the court afterwards, to find out which date had been set for his trial, that he was informed the case had been dropped.  

A spokesman for TfGM said the company had not been made aware of the fare-dodging allegation, connected to the third incident, until it had already gone to court.

But Mr McMahon claims he informed the operator about all three incidents from the outset. He is also furious that the previous incidents of fraud were not taken into account. 

TfGM has not confirmed whether or not it has pursued the case in order to track down the true identity of the fare dodger.  

A TfGM spokesman said: ‘Two cases were withdrawn as soon as Mr McMahon contacted Metrolink’s operator MRDL and provided evidence.

‘However, in the third case, when a different date of birth was given by a fare dodger, no contact was made with MRDL until after it had been to court when Mr McMahon made a statutory declaration.

‘Had Mr McMahon contacted MRDL in good time, this case would also have been withdrawn immediately. The onus is on Mr McMahon to come to us.’ 

They later added: ‘In light of the repeated difficulties Mr McMahon has faced with fare dodgers using his details, MRDL has agreed to contact him directly if his details are given in the future.’

But Mr McMahon added: ‘Metrolink hasn’t been in touch to apologise for all the inconvenience that I have suffered.'
