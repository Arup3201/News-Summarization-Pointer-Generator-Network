A missing five-year-old British girl at the centre of a tug-of-love dispute has been found in Russia and should be back in England by next week, a High Court judge said today.

Alice Davies has been found safe and well with her teacher mother Jacqueline, 49, following the publicity surrounding her disappearance two years ago.

Ms Davies is due to appear at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in Birmingham on Tuesday, Mr Justice Keehan said.

Alice Davies has been found safe with her mother Jacqueline in Russia after disappearing two years ago

Ms Davies had become involved in family court proceedings after separating from former partner and Alice's father Julian Brown.

A judge had ruled that Mr Brown should have contact with his daughter and there followed a dispute, when Ms Davies disappeared with Alice.

'I’m delighted,' Mr Brown said after today’s hearing.

'I haven’t seen Alice for nearly two years. I’m just keeping my fingers crossed that everything goes to plan and I’ll see her next week.'

News of Alice’s discovery emerged today at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, where the little girl’s grandparents were appearing after the judge found them in contempt of court.

A High Court judge ruled that Ms Davies' parents and sister were in contempt of court for not having revealed all they know about her disappearance

Brian and Patricia Davies - who are both in their 70s and come from Pentyrch, Cardiff - were remanded in custody on Friday after Mr Justice Keehan concluded that they had lied when asked for information about the child’s whereabouts.

Melanie Williams - Alice’s aunt and a mother-of-two - also appeared after being remanded in custody on Friday when the judge concluded that she had also lied and was in contempt.

Mr Justice Keehan said in the light of Alice’s discovery all three could be released.

The judge imposed a 12-day prison sentence on each and said they should serve half that sentence.

He said time spent on remand would form part of the sentence and therefore all three could be released today.

Mr and Mrs Davies and Ms Williams, who had been arrested late on Thursday, were led into court in handcuffs by security staff.

Mr Brown had asked the judge not to impose jail terms on Mr and Mrs Davies and Ms Williams.
