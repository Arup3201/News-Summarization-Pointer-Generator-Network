Blushing bride: Laxmi Sargara looks delighted on her second wedding day after her first marriage - performed when she was just one - was annulled

A child bride, who hit international headlines after being the first in India to annul her marriage, has wed for the second time.

Laxmi Sargara, now 19, happily exchanged vows with Mahendra Sargara, 23, at a traditional Hindu ceremony

Around 150 people, including her parents and extended family and friends, were apart of the celebrations after a tumultuous year.

Speaking from her new home, in Jodhpur, central India, Laxmi said she believed it was the right time to marry again.

‘My
first marriage was against my wishes, I wasn't satisfied at all and it 
left me very unhappy,’ she said. ‘But I am now very happy. I have 
overcome my past life and hope I have a bright future ahead of me.’

Laxmi
was only a year old when her parents, father Teja Ram Sargara, 50 and 
her mother Sukdi, 45, married her to a three-year-old boy in a 
traditional child marriage ritual in Khera village, Rajasthan.

Oblivious of the marriage, Laxmi grew up with dreams of an exciting future until her parents told her the truth when she was 18.

She
refused to join her husband and in-laws and ran away, turning to the 
Sarathi Trust, a social organisation run by Rehabilitation Psychologist 
Kriti Bharti, who helped her legally annul the marriage.

Laxmi became a symbol of hope for child brides all over the world.

She
said: ‘I have gone through a tough time. Annulling the marriage wasn't 
accepted by my society initially so I went through a lot of pain but 
thanks to Kriti we got through the tough time together.’

Laxmi’s family met Mahendra, a farmer, at a neighbour’s wedding last year.

Her own choice: Laxmi's father Teja Ram Sargara and mother Sukdi (with her in left picture) had married her when she was just one according to Hindu traditions. She did not find out until she was 18 and then immediately ran away until her marriage was annulled. The 19-year-old has now found happiness with Mahendra Sargara who she wed last week (right)

Fresh start: Laxmi, seen here with one of her guests, had feared her ex-husband's family would interrupt her second wedding

Initially, it was feared Laxmi would never marry again because of the stigma attached to her controversial annulment.

Hindu
tradition does not allow child brides to marry again unless money is 
exchanged under the Naata Pratha tradition. But thankfully Mahendra and 
his family understood.

Nata Pratha is a traditional system in
Rajasthan where a married woman can go with another man in lieu of 
money paid to the husband or his family by the second man.

Family life: Laxmi said her new husband had been mature enough to accept the past

Laxmi added: ‘It was going to be difficult for me to remarry but my family stood by me and chose a mature husband for me.’

She also feared her former in-laws might turn up at the wedding demanding money from her new in-laws but thankfully they stayed away.

‘My new husband has been mature enough to understand my position and he accepts my past. My life was almost ruined but now I can see a happy life and future.’

Laxmi is now settling into her new home and plans to work while also supporting her new husband.

She added: ‘Child marriage affects children both mentally and physically. It’s torture in every way possible.

'I hope all parents realise that marrying their children at such a young age threatens their future. They need to stop, now.’

Kriti Bharti, 25, said: ‘Laxmi has been on a huge journey and she’s learnt to live her life again. I helped with her rehabilitation and to build her confidence again.

'She’s now living her life to her own agenda and I’m very happy for her. She looked very beautiful at her wedding, and more importantly happy. It was a special day.’

Although child marriages were officially
outlawed in India in 1929, the practice is still common in many parts 
of the country, especially in poor rural communities.

recent Unicef report says 47 per 
cent of married women in India wed before age 18 and that 40 percent of 
the world's child marriages take place in the country.

Girls married in their infancy usually 
continue to live with their parents until they reach puberty at which 
point they are taken to their husband's family.

A survey found that 10 per cent of girls in Rajasthan are married off before the age of 18.
