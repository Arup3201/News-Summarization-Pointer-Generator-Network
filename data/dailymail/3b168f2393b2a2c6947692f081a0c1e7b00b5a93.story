He's one of the greatest living filmmakers and it seems Sir Ridley Scott has his sights set on Australia to film his next science-fiction blockbuster.

Scott was seen taking a VIP tour of the Fox Studios lot in Sydney on that same day, with the Australian industry abuzz about the project.

Down Under: Sir Ridley Scott arrived at Sydney airport on Wednesday to begin a 'secret project' which we now know is Prometheus 2  

'It's the best kept secret at the moment, that Ridley is here to film the Prometheus sequel,' an insider told the MailOnline.

'Staff have been pulled off productions on the Gold Coast and Melbourne to take meetings about it.

'The news couldn't come at a better time, with Gods Of Egypt and San Andreas wrapping soon people were looking for the next project.'

The source said he and several other well-placed professionals only became aware of the project when Scott touched ground at Sydney airport on Wednesday, with pre-production remaining tight-lipped.

The pioneering filmmaker - best known for films such as Blade Runner and Gladiator - filmed the first Prometheus film at the famous Shepperton and Pinewood Studios in the UK.

With a production budget of $130 million, the sci-fi epic was a prequel to Scott's 1979 classic Alien and set within the same universe.

Starring Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender and Idris Elba, the film was a commercial hit - taking over $403million at the international box-office.

Sydney's Fox Studios seems like the perfect home for the feature - which is a franchise of 20th Century Fox - given its world-class facilities, which have seen two Wolverine films, The Great Gatsby and Superman Returns among some of the blockbusters that have shot there.

Multi-pic deal: The British filmmaker is also rumoured to be looking at filming Blade Runner 2 Down Under

Gerard Butler and Geoffrey Rush are  in production on Alex Proyas' mythological blockbuster Gods Of Egypt, which is shooting at Fox Studios currently.

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's 3D earthquake film San Andreas is being filmed on the Gold Coast at Warner Brothers Village Roadshow studios, and is the only other large scale blockbuster in Australia at the moment. 

Rumour has it that Scott is looking at a multi-picture agreement with Screen Australia to also film Blade Runner 2 in Australia some time in early 2015.

Frequent collaborators: Russell Crowe and Scott have worked together on several projects, including Robin Hood but also the role that won Crowe an Oscar: Gladiator

The British director previously described scenes from the sequel to the 1982 film as needing 'vast farmland where there's no hedges or anything else in sight... where you can see for miles, but it's dirt' - which would fit with several Australian filming locations. Such locations were used for scenes in Mad Max: Fury Road and Wolf Creek 2.

While promoting his latest film X-Men: Days Of Future Past, Fassbender recently confirmed that he will be returning to work with Scott on Prometheus 2, re-joining Rapace.

The film is set for a March 4, 2016, release and is set to start filming this year.

Australian screen industry body AusFilm said they had 'no comment on Ridley Scott currently being in Australia'.
