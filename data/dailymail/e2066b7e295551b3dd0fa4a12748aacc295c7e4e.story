Geologists believe they have found the youngest remains of the oldest and largest impact crater on the planet.

The discovery was made in South Africa’s Vredefort impact crater which was formed when a 6 mile (10 km) meteorite slammed into it 2 billion years ago.

Until now, scientists had thought all of the ‘impact melt’ rocks had been eroded away as 6 miles (10km) of Vredefort has already disappeared since it formed.

But researchers at the Western University in Ontario, Canada, claim they have found ‘definitive evidence’ that dikes in the centre of the crater were as young as the crater itself.

Scientists hope the finding of Vredefort's impact melt could help researchers search for even older impact craters to reveal more secrets about the Earth's history.

The impact crater was once thought to be much bigger at about 185 miles (300 km) across, according to a report by Becky Oskin writing in LiveScience.

When the meteorite hit, it caused a thousand-megaton blast of energy. The heat from impact was enough to melt the Earth’s crust creating a magma lake.

Two billion years ago a huge meteorite hit the Earth about 100km southwest of Johannesburg creating the Vredefort impact crater.

The meteorite, larger than Table Mountain, caused a thousand-megaton blast of energy. The impact would have vaporised about 70 cubic kilometres of rock. The heat from impact was enough to melt the Earth’s crust creating a magma lake.

The world has about 130 crater structures of possible impact origin. The Vredefort Dome is among the top three, and is the oldest and largest clearly visible meteorite impact site in the world.

What remains of the event are impact-related rocks composed of broken fragments of minerals formed just after impact.

In the 1990s, Professor Desmond Moser of Western University accidently discovered 2-billion-year-old zircons — tiny minerals – which had no signs of violent shocks.

But immediately after its discovery, geologists came out to disprove that the minerals found in the dikes were remains of Vredefort's impact melt.

Professor Moser recently returned to South Africa to provide concrete evidence that the magma dikes were as young as the crater itself.

The geologist and his team found that the zircons were intertwined with their surrounding materials, which means they couldn’t have formed from the heat of impact.

They also found levels of the element hafnium, which suggests that the magma melted from the 3-billion-year-old rocks originally on top of the crater.

Professor Moser told Live Science: ‘What Vredefort teaches us is that we haven't been looking with the right set of eyes at some of these ancient rocks.’
