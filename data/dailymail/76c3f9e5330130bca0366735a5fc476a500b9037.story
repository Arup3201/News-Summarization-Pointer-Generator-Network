Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo is doubtful with a groin injury for Sunday's crunch clash with Tottenham at Old Trafford.

Manager Louis van Gaal revealed that the Argentina international will have a 'minor problem' assessed before the game as the Reds prepare to take on Spurs in a key fixture in the battle for a top-four place in the Premier League.

Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo picked up the injury against Arsenal on Monday night

Rojo started Monday's FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal at centre-half to accommodate Luke Shaw's return but reverted to the left-hand side of defence in the second half when Shaw was replaced by Phil Jones, before going off with 17 minutes left in the 2-1 defeat.

However, Shaw should be available for the visit of in-form Spurs to Old Trafford but Angel Di Maria and Jonny Evans are both ruled out by suspension.

Manager Louis van Gaal said Rojo has a 'minor problem' and will be assessed before Sunday's game

'More or less, only Robin van Persie is injured,' van Gaal told MUTV. 'That is a good sign – when you have a defeat and all your players want to train and show the energy in the training session. That's good to see.

'Rojo is a little bit injured. You have to take care of the health of the players. He has a minor problem. Maybe I'll take him out of the game against Tottenham Hotspur, but I have to decide.'
