The NFL's first openly gay player, Michael Sam, has been named Man of the Year by men's magazine GQ, and celebrated the accolade by planting a kiss on his partner Vito Cammisano. 

Sam, who was drafted into the St Louis Rams earlier this year, took home the award at a ceremony at West Hollywood's Chateau Marmont last night.

Other stars in contention for the prize were Chris Pratt, Steve Carell, Dave Chappelle, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley.

Sealed with a kiss: NFL player Michael Sam kisses his boyfriend Vito Cammisano after being named GQ Man of the Year 2014 in West Hollywood last night

Happy couple: Sam was nominated for the award along with Chris Pratt, Steve Carell, Dave Chappelle, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley and featured on the cover of GQ magazine in December

Cut: Sam was initially selected to play for the St Louis Rams, left, before being cut; he was then named in a Dallas Cowboys practice squad, right, but was then cut from the team

The athlete won the award despite having not yet played an on-season game in the NFL. He was cut from the Rams squad in August, but was later picked for a Dallas Cowboys practice team, only to be dropped again in October. 

When asked by TMZ why he thought he was not on the roster of an NFL team, Sam said; 'I think I was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year last year ... so I don't think it had to do with talent.'

And while they took that to mean Sam was saying he was cut because he was gay, he quickly clarified his statement on Twitter.

He wrote: 'Despite what headlines you may read, I’ve never said and have never believed that I am being kept out of the league.

'I know I have talent to play in the NFL and I look forward to getting an opportunity once again to prove that I can help a team win.'

So in Love: Sam has been very public about his relationship with his boyfriend Cammisano, right

Clearing the air: Sam later clarified his statement to TMZ on Twitter

Reaffirming: He repeated that he knew he had the talent, but has never believed his sexuality is why he was cut or not playing

Superstar: Sam was named one of GQ's Men of the Year

Football or not, Sam's career has been taking off since he graduated from University of Missouri, with the  24-year-old becoming perhaps the most famous openly gay professional athlete. 

And if the NFL doesn't work out he does have a big fan in Mötley Crüe front man Vince Neil, who has been very vocal about wanting him for he new Las Vegas Arena Football League team.
