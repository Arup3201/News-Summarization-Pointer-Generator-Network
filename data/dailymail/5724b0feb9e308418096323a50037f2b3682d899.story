A happy couple have tied the knot - in the Morrisons cafe where they used to go on dates together.

Rebecca Wooller, 44, and Blake Green, 53, replaced wedding bells with the jingle of tills as they walked down a shopping aisle at their favourite supermarket in Cambourne, Cambridgeshire.

Customers going about their Saturday afternoon shop got more than they bargained for as the bride's arrival was announced over the store's speaker system.

Happy couple: Blake Green and Rebecca Wooller enjoyed romantic meals in the store cafe - the location of their first date

They looked on in surprise and snapped photographs on mobile phones as the pair made their way through fresh produce and down the Easter egg aisle before a ceremony in the supermarket's cafe. 

The couple's first date was over a plate of chicken curry and chips at the store and after a whirlwind seven-month romance they decided there was no better place to say 'I do'.

Ms Wooller, a former undertaker, walked down the aisle to Disney hit film Frozen's Love Is An Open Door.

Wearing a 1950s vintage style cream dress, she was accompanied down the aisle by her two daughters Naomi, 24 and Rosie, 23 who were her bridesmaids.

Her grandson Charlie, five, carried the rings down the aisle.

She said: 'People may think we're as mad as a box of frogs but it holds real memories for us.

'We wanted everybody else to have a good time - if they were out doing their shopping, we hope they stopped and had a laugh with us.

'The ceremony was really moving. I know it was quirky but for us it was also really special.'

The couple met in September after being introduced by a friend and, because of illness, Ms Wooller was not able to travel far for dates.

Mr Green, a pharmaceutical manager, proposed after two weeks, initially buying a ring from eBay and then surprising her with a Vera Wang diamond ring.

Gemma Avery, a store manager who organised the event, said: 'It's just such a lovely story which we're happy to be part of.

'Their eyes met over a plate of chicken curry and it's been like a fairytale ever since.

'We've provided food and flowers and a lot of the staff have dressed up for the occasion - it's been a really fun, positive thing to be involved in.' 

The couple still shop at the store despite it now being a 20-minute drive away for them.
