The dancer at a strip club who claims Tennessee Titans defensive linesman Sammie Hill raped her says that she woke to find the NFL player forcing himself on her in a Atlanta hotel room saying 'I'm just trying to get this last nut'.

The woman, who works in a Houston club, admitted to police that she had consensual sex with the 28-year-old before she fell asleep on December 3.

However, she claims she repeatedly said no when Hill 'placed his hand around her throat while attempting to stick his penis in her vagina.'

Accused: Titans defensive linesman, Sammie Lee Hill, has found himself at the center of a sexual abuse allegation  

In her police report, which has been handed to Atlanta police and seen by TMZ, the woman said that after she resisted Hill a number of times, he apologized and gave her $300 in cash.

The woman claims to have been left with bruises on her neck by Hill after the alleged assault.

While police in Houston took the initial report, Atlanta police have said that no charges have been pressed and no one has been arrested.

'The Atlanta Police Dept. has been contacted by a female who advised she was sexually assaulted by Sammie Hill, who is a NFL player,' the police department said in a release on Monday.

'We are working with the female to obtain information about this incident. At this time, the report is not available.'

Aware: The Titans have issued a statement saying they know of the report and are letting the police investigate 

On Monday, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department, John Cannon, said that they took a 'courtesy report' from the 37-year-old woman after she came to then claiming she had been raped.

Houston police have claimed they have never identified Hill as the player involved and said that they handed the report over to their colleagues in Atlanta.

Atlanta Police Department spokesman John Chaffee wrote in an email that a woman told police she had been sexually assaulted by Hill and they are working with the woman for more information.

The Titans have issued a statement to say: "We will let the police investigate the allegation and we will provide any assistance they need. We have discussed the matter with Sammie and we will continue to gather facts."

Hill is in the middle of a three-year, $11.4 million deal with the Titans.

Hill, who played at Stillman and a West Blocton, Alabama, native, is a six-year veteran in the second year of a three-year deal with Tennessee. The 6-foot-4, 328-pound Hill has started 12 games this season.
