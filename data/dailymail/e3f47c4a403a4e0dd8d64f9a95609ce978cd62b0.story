The police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s £3million home may have been illegal and could wreck any case against him, a senior lawyer warned yesterday.

The row over the investigation deepened after the police were warned that any evidence they gathered against the 73-year-old may be struck out if it ever came to court.

Last night Sir Cliff announced that he was pulling out of a concert at Canterbury Cathedral next month as the star feared it would be ‘overshadowed’ by allegations that he molested a schoolboy at a Christian rally in 1985, which he denies.

His spokesman said: ‘Sir Cliff was due to perform on September 26 at a charitable event in Canterbury Cathedral but doesn’t want the event to be overshadowed by the false allegation and has therefore withdrawn. He is sorry for any disappointment or inconvenience caused.’

The blow for fans comes as Sir Cliff is yet to confirm when he will fly home from his villa in Portugal to face a police quiz.

Yesterday his close friend Cilla Black said she was ‘absolutely positive’ of his innocence. The singer and former Blind Date presenter has been a close friend since they recorded a song together in 1969.

‘I, like everyone else, was shocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they are without foundation,’ she said.

Human rights QC Geoffrey Robertson yesterday questioned the legality of the search warrant obtained at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court by detectives before they raided Sir Cliff’s Berkshire home almost a week ago.

The 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act requires police to satisfy a magistrate not only that there are reasonable grounds for believing an offence has been committed, but there is material on the premises relevant to prove the alleged crime. A warrant should be issued only if it is ‘not practicable to communicate’ with the owner of the premises.

But in this case Sir Cliff only learnt of the search as the BBC filmed live from a helicopter.

‘The police cannot raid your home on a hunch,’ said Mr Robertson. ‘They must make a solemn application to a court, identifying the material they are looking for and swearing that it will be of “substantial value” – in this case to supporting a complaint about an assault 30 years ago.

‘They must explain why they were unable to contact Cliff Richard or his lawyers or agents.

‘Most significantly they should have told the court about their deal with the BBC, because that was a significant matter that would disincline any magistrate from granting the search warrant. Before they blasted Cliff Richard’s reputation throughout the world, they should have given him the opportunity to refute the allegation. The importance of police following the rules is that if they do not, any evidence they obtain may be ruled inadmissible and their case would collapse.’

South Yorkshire Police has said it reluctantly agreed to work with the broadcaster after being approached by a reporter with information about its investigation. Yesterday, sources confirmed that Chief Constable David Crompton will appear before MPs after the Home Affairs Select Committee wrote to him and BBC Director-General Lord Tony Hall warning them they may be called to give evidence.

Yesterday the BBC released a statement saying its reporting had been ‘balanced and proportionate’ and it had given ‘due prominence’ to Sir Cliff’s denials.

‘It is worth noting that we made contact with Sir Cliff Richard’s agent as soon as the search had started but well before we broadcast the story,’ it said.
