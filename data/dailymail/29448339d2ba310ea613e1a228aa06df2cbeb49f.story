Garry Monk won’t have needed to make one particular phone call this week. His conversations with Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez tend to come when doubts enter his mind, but that doesn’t quite apply after a win at Manchester United.

There is no need for the discussions he sought this summer after three of his leading players told him they wanted to leave. No need to ask what Rodgers and Martinez would have done - as he occasionally does - but only after he has made his decision and put it into action.

Wins at Old Trafford have a habit of helping confidence, especially when coming against a backdrop of criticism. ‘I pretty much guarantee that everyone in here didn’t give us a hope in hell before the game,’ he said to the press after Swansea’s 2-1 win.

Monk has been ‘written off for years’. He will, by declaration, ‘work so hard that if I fail I will know I could have done no more’.

The club joker of the past decade is not smiling and isn’t breaking eye contact. In a room called the creche at the Liberty Stadium, the League’s youngest manager tells Sportsmail: ‘Every day I am earning the right to be seen as a better manager. I want to earn the right to call myself a top manager. But I know this could be my only chance.’ Moments later he yawns; some club staff think he is working too hard.

This is a 35-year-old man feeling his way into a brutal trade, where the statistics he quotes say ‘50 per cent of first-time managers lose their job in the first year and 50 per cent of those won’t go on to manage again’.

It’s a position he has spent years thinking about, but one he might never have reached if his back hadn’t gone into spasm two seasons ago. ‘That was a big moment,’ Monk says.

He is trying to make sense of the events that led to him taking over from Michael Laudrup in February. In August 2012 the Dane told Monk he was free to leave. The message was not delivered callously, but it set in motion a sequence of events that may have stopped Monk replacing Laudrup. ‘I didn’t have conversations with Michael about leaving. I read it in the press. I didn’t want to go, definitely not. I was close to my 10th year here, we had gone through the divisions together. This is not just a club for me.

‘But I know how football works. A move to Bristol City was arranged and I’m not sure people realise how close I was to going.

‘I was going to go that weekend but got a back spasm and didn’t train for three days. I told them I would be ready in two weeks, but they needed me immediately. It fell through, so I decided to work my nuts off and convince the manager he could rely on me. I ended up playing 15 games that season and the rest is history.’

It meant he was at the club and under serious consideration in February when Laudrup was sacked. In the opinion of chairman Huw Jenkins, the club’s principles were being ‘eroded’.

Monk, a Swan since 2004, stepped in as caretaker, several years ahead of schedule. He slept one hour a day in his first four days on the job and opened with a derby demolition of Cardiff. They finished 12th and barring a week off in the summer with his partner, their young daughter and five-month-old twins, Monk has not stopped since Laudrup left.

‘It’s been so hectic I’ve barely had time to think,’ he says. The early part of his summer was dominated by the fallout of talks with Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Chico Flores, all of whom said they wanted to leave. ‘I wanted to keep them but they wanted different challenges,’ says Monk.

‘I made a decision that I only wanted players who really wanted to be here so I let them go. It’s important here that players want to be part of this group.’

Once the decisions were made, he phoned a couple of old Swansea managers who help when they can. ‘I tend to act first, then call,’ Monk says.

‘Brendan (Rodgers) and Roberto (Martinez) have been great. I [don’t] just call up managers and ask what to do. I’ll deal with it myself because I feel that is the way I’ll learn. If I think I have done it right then great, but if I think I could have done it better I’ll ask for advice, “This is how I dealt with it. How would you deal with it?"

‘Every mistake I have learnt from. I had chats with Brendan about the situation with players leaving. I have asked about situations he and Roberto had. But it was only after I did something myself - there is a lot to learn and often not much time.’

Time comes up frequently in this conversation. ‘I know how hard it is to stay in this business,’ he says. ‘I know that as well as I get on with the board, they will not hesitate to do what is best for the club if we don’t perform.

‘But if you manage by fear of that you’re done. You have to keep learning until you are a good manager - you have to use your time well. I am in this job and now I have to work as hard as I can to learn fast and make it a success.

‘It’s all happened very quickly. My thought process was to do my badges, carry on with the Under 13s and probably head into the academy and build myself up. But the situation changed.

‘It was always my hope to manage this club but I thought it would be far into the future. It might not have come again, so do I stand up and be counted or lay down and die? I have always stood up to be counted.’

With that, the man who made the ‘£90million block’ to stop Noel Hunt’s shot in the 2011 play-off final against Reading is diving into his memory, from League Two to Premier League.

‘People talk about what it was like when I first got here, but in 2012 we were a Premier League club training at a health club.

‘You’d come in thinking about playing Chelsea and in the shower you’d have an 80-year-old man next to you, asking what happened in the previous game. That’s Swansea. I love this club.

‘It’s part of our journey. We have top-class facilities now but when Michael Laudrup joined his office was a cupboard under the stairs.’

Monk is laughing. He says management gained him 2,000 followers on Twitter and that ‘twins are easier to deal with than players because they don’t answer back. They only care about getting fed and CBeebies’.

He sets aside an hour a night where he ignores his phone. ‘It is so hard to switch off but I try,’ he says. The phone has buzzed three times in this interview. ‘After downtime at home there are always missed calls I struggle to return,’ he says. ‘That’s the job.’

If he has his way - and more results like at Old Trafford - it will be his for a while yet.
