A new dating app claims to be 'putting the excitement back into dating' by pushing users' personalities ahead of their looks.

Much like Tinder - the notorious dating app responsible for making 'swipe left' a cultural reference - FuzzyBanter can hook you up with people living in your area.

But rather than have singles base their dating choices on potentially cringeworthy profile pictures, the app 'fuzzes' your face to let your listed interests do the matchmaking instead.

New dating app FuzzyBanter blurs out profile pictures to let the listed interests and personality traits of its users become the the main attraction

All FuzzyBanter dating profile pictures are blurred to start off with (pictured right), though you can reveal what you look like further down the line. Age, height and ethnicity can still be used as search filters, to help people find their perfect match (pictured left)

Claiming to 'bring courtship back to the 21st century', the app allows users to list up to ten interests when they sign up, along with a 160 character bio.

You'll also need to enter your age, height, location, star sign and ethnicity, which can all be used as filters for potential dates to find what they're looking for.

Once your vitals are in and your profile set up, you can search people by their proximity to you, just like on Tinder, and give anyone you like a thumbs up, or 'nudge'.

If a person you've 'nudged' gives you a nudge back, congratulations, you've made a match and can now start messaging.

Blending Facebook's Poke button with Tinder's swipe left or swipe right function, FuzzyBanter asks you to swipe right to 'nudge' a person you like. If they nudge you back, you have a match and can start chatting

Once you've reached the messaging stage with a potential date, this is where the fuzzy fun really begins.

Though the idea behind the app is find matches based on your common interests and compatibility, singles don't have to agree to a blind date.

Both participants have the option to either partially or fully reveal their profile picture, before anyone has shelled out for dinner or a drink.

Found a FuzzyBanter match? Once you've started a conversation you can chose to reveal as much of your profile picture as you like, by altering the level of fuziness using the sliding scale

Stuck for words? The messaging feature in the dating app includes a long list of conversation templates, some far more flirty than others, to help even the shiest of daters get the ball rolling 

Launching last night with a VIP bash in London, the app already has celebrity backing from the likes of Eastenders' Danny Dyer, actresses Lisa Faulkner and Angela Griffin, Apprentice winner Mark Wright, and TOWIE cast members Elliot Wright, Jessica Wright and James Argent.

Founded by Allen James Scriven and Michael John Caine, FuzzyBanter is aimed at people aged between 18 and 45, looking for the perfect match.

The app can even help you kick off the conversation if you're feeling a little shy, with a whole host of pre-written message templates.
