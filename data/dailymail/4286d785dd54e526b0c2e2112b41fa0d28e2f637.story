It is not the usual route for adverts making a statement about drink driving, but this Budweiser commercial has been already been viewed more than seven million times on YouTube.

Featuring the bond between a young man and his adorable labrador, the advert focuses on worried loved ones when someone doesn't make it home from a night out.

Entitled 'Friends Are Waiting', the commercial features a montage showing the bond between man and dog, before showing him leaving the house with a pack of beer and the words: 'I'll see you later buddy'.

The tone changes from the happy scenes of the pair jumping into lakes and going for walks to a despondent pet looking out the window and waiting for his master.

The words on the screen read: 'For some the waiting never ended. But we can change that.'

The footage then cuts to the dog owner opening the door the next morning and being warmly welcomed by his pet dog. He says: 'I'm sorry, I decided I shouldn't drive home last night, I stayed at Dave's.'

The caption at the end of the Budweiser advert reads: 'Next time you go out, be sure to make a plan to get home safely. Your friends are counting on you.'   

Friends: The man carries his dog adoringly at the start of the new Budweiser commercial

Sleepy: The man sleeps on the couch while his dog climbs up on time of him and licks his nose

The advert was released on Friday as part of America's 5th annual Global Be(er) Responsible Day.

It encourages viewers to share the video using the hashtag #FriendsAreWaiting.

It's not the first time Budweiser has used dogs in its adverts. 

Drinks: The man leaves his home with his friends and a pack of Budweiser bottles

Waiting: The dog waits patiently long into the night for his owner to return 

Brian Perkins, Vice President of marketing at Budweiser told AdAge: 'Friendship, camaraderie and enjoying great times are at the heart of Budweiser's most popular campaigns, and this video maintains that tradition but with an unexpected twist.

'Budweiser is known for connecting with beer drinkers in memorable ways, and our efforts to promote responsible drinking through this video are no exception.'
