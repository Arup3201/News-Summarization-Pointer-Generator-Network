Big moment: Smith receives his receipt showing his alimony payment has gone through - then proudly holds it up so everyone inside the bank can see

Build up: Prior to receiving his receipt, Smith excitedly shouted ''Thank you Jesus, I'm free at last! Free at last! Whoo!' and raised his hands in the air 

After briefly waiting in line, Smith says to a bank teller 'How ya doing, baby? You know what I'm here to do? I'm making my last alimony payment' and dances up to her counter.

'I ain't gotta pay it no more,' he continues. 'I'm so happy. Nine thousand, nine hundred dollars. Ninety-nine hundred dollars and I'm done!'

Holding his hands up in the air, Smith yells 'Thank you Jesus, I'm free at last! Free at last! Whoo!'

He then hands the receipt to the cashier, and mentions out loud his happiness, and announces he plans to breakdance. At one point he also offers a shout-out to his girlfriend.

'Nine thousand, nine hundred dollars - ninety-nine - that's ten thousand dollars, folks,' he says in the clip. 'That's a tax deduction, whoo! That's what I'm talking about.'

Victory dance: Smith got on the floor and kicked his legs into the air, before getting up to jump for joy 

He also dances eagerly while waiting to receive his receipt.

When he receives the receipt from the cashier, he holds it up toward the camera - then heads toward the floor, lies on his back, and starts his celebratory dance.

Cackling, he kicks legs up in the air, shouts, gets up and does the moonwalk, jumps in the air, then bows. 

In an interview with The New York Daily News, Smith told the newspaper he gave his wife $825 per month because of her unemployment at the time of the couple's divorce last year.

The 54-year-old Smith works as both an insurance agent and as a musician, the newspaper reported.

'I [told my ex-wife] I know now that I can save $10,000 a year and maybe more,' he told The New York Daily News. 'In this country we don't save our money. I should have been a millionaire by now and it's my fault.'

Smith will also dole out $500 monthly payments in a twelve-month period to cover various living expenses for his ex-wife, the newspaper reported.

'I'll be doing another break dance,' Smith told The New York Daily News.
