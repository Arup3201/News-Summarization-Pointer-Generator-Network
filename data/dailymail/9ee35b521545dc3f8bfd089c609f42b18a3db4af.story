Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have called on tyre manufacturer Pirelli to improve the performance of their wet-weather tyre in order to make Formula One safer.

Hamilton, who leads the drivers’ standings with three races remaining, and Vettel, the reigning four-time champion, are both in agreement that Pirelli’s current wet-weather tyre, which was introduced this season, is not up to scratch.

Their comments come in the wake of Jules Bianchi’s horror crash at the rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix.

The Frenchman suffered a severe head trauma when he ploughed into the back of a tractor after he aquaplaned off the track on the intermediate tyre – the lighter treaded of the two options – despite the worsening weather conditions.

‘It is no secret that they are not the greatest wet tyres that I have known,’ said Hamilton.

‘The slick will always be improved, but I guess not so much focus gets put on the wet. You want a tyre that clears the water and does not force us to go to the intermediate when it is so much quicker, and when it is probably not safe enough to do so.’

Bianchi catastrophically lost control of his Marussia during the closing stages of the race in Suzuka. He remains in a grave condition at Mie University Hospital, 10 miles from the circuit.

‘It’s definitely something we’ve passed on already, not just after Japan,’ said Vettel, who raised his concerns about the intermediate tyre in a drivers’ briefing ahead of last week’s Russian Grand Prix. ‘Currently the extreme tyre has a very narrow window and the intermediate is quicker.

‘As soon as you’ve got rid of most of the water, you try to put the intermediate on, taking a lot of risk into account, just because it’s the quicker tyre. ‘That’s something we need to work on.’

Sergio Marchionne, the man employed by Ferrari to replace former chairman Luca Di Montezemolo, says the famous marque must ‘kick some ass’ in order to return to winning ways.

Ferrari are approaching the end of yet another below-par campaign with a dissatisfied Fernando Alonso heading for the exit, news confirmed by the departing Di Montezemolo on Wednesday.

‘We’ve got to kick some ass and we’ve got to do it quickly,’ said Marchionne, who will make Vettel the highest-paid driver in the sport’s history with the German leaving Red Bull to join Ferrari in a £50million-a-year deal. ‘We might screw up, but we’ve got nothing to lose, right? Let’s risk something.’
