An aspiring actor has been arrested after posing as a Twilight star and seducing a 14-year-old girl over Facebook then driving to the girl's home in Iowa to pick her up.

Police say David LaVera, 33, of San Diego, California, pretended to be Kiowa Gordon, 24 who played a minor character Embry in three of the Twilight Saga films, as he chatted with the teen from the small town of Baxter, Iowa.

He then drove to the girl's house and convinced her to get into his car after posing for pictures with her older sister on Tuesday afternoon.

KCCI-TV reports that he had posed as the hunky actor in nearby Newton, Iowa, the night before and was seen bar hopping, signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans.'

The victim's sister called their mother to tell them the teen had left with LaVera. The mother, April Roush, called police.

LaVera and the teen were spotted on the outskirts of town by one of Ms Roush's friends, who stood in front of his car and demanded the girl come with her.

After she was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away.

Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later.

The girl's mother, April Roush, said she fears she never would have seen her daughter alive if LaVera hadn't been stopped before he left town with her

In his car, they found two swords and four daggers. 

Baxter Police Chief Steve Wright told WHO-TV that he fears to think what LaVera's intentions were for the girl.

'This isn’t somebody that just wants to be friends. And typically this is the kind of person that meets a profile of somebody that can be a predator and can be dangerous,' he said.

Ms Roush credited her friend who rescued her daughter with saving the girl's life.

'I don't think I would have ever seen my daughter again. And if so, it would have been to bury her,' she told WHO. 

Ms Roush says she her daughter was so convinced that LaVera was the Twilight star that she still believes Kiowa Gordon was the one who came to pick her up.

According to the Internet Movie Database, LaVera has appeared in 13 movies, including  Die Fighting, Fortune 500 Man and a non-speaking role in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.
