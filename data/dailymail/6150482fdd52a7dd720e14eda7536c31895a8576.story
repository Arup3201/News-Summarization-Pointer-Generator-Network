England's most senior doctor yesterday admitted she had taken cannabis.

Professor Sally Davies also appeared to question the policy of treating drug abuse as a criminal offence.

Dame Sally, the chief medical officer, said she had experimented with cannabis three or four times at university but stopped after suffering hallucinations.

She has previously claimed that criminalising drugs deterred addicts from seeking medical help.

Dame Sally has also said she would be ‘ready with quite a lot of advice’ if ministers decided to decriminalise some drugs.

Mental
 health charities have warned that any move to liberalise Britain’s 
drugs laws could increase the use of cannabis, which has been widely 
linked to psychological problems.

Dame Sally, 63, recently named as the sixth most powerful woman in Britain, revealed she had tried cannabis baked into cookies while studying medicine at Manchester University in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The Government’s most senior medical adviser said: ‘I never smoked, so I couldn’t smoke joints, but I did have some cookies until on the third or fourth occasion I had hallucinations and I have never touched it since.

‘I think I understood through that what my father said to me when I told him I was going to try it. He said drugs de-civilise you, you stop being a civilised person.’

Dame Sally, who was appointed as 
England’s chief medical officer in 2010, has always stopped short of 
supporting the decriminalisation of any illegal drugs.

But she has repeatedly questioned whether
 the Government’s policy on drug use should be driven by the Home 
Office, with its inevitable focus on law and order, or by the Department
 of Health.

Interviewed on BBC Radio 3’s Private 
Passions yesterday, she said: ‘Of course it’s a medical problem, 
addiction is a medical problem and it becomes a public health problem 
and then our society is choosing to treat that as a criminal justice 
issue.’

Giving evidence to MPs on the science and technology select 
committee in January, she said: ‘I think we have a health problem and we
 would do well as a nation to look at it as a health problem.

‘I think there’s quite a lot of evidence from other countries, and science, about how you could go about that.’

Her
 comments drew criticism from anti-drugs campaigners. Peter Stoker, of 
the National Drug Prevention Alliance, said: ‘When people say they want 
it treated as a health matter what they really mean is they want it 
decriminalised.

‘There are health implications to using cannabis but there are also social and legal problems.’

Mary
 Brett, of charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Lots of people try it at
 university but it would have been helpful if she could have said that 
cannabis now is much stronger and more dangerous than when she tried it.

‘She is the chief medical officer, she ought to have included some kind of warning to children not to try it.’

Dame Sally is England's first female chief medical officer

Around
 two million people in Britain use cannabis, according to the Royal 
College of Psychiatrists, and half of all 16 to 29-year-olds have tried 
it at least once.  But recent research has suggested the drug can be 
linked to psychotic illnesses.

The Home Office has resisted numerous 
calls for the radical liberalisation of Britain’s drug laws, including 
from its own advisers.

Professor David Nutt was sacked as chairman of
 the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs after he criticised the 
decision to upgrade cannabis to a Class B drug in 2009.

Dame Sally 
admitted her high-profile role, which has a salary of more than 
£200,000, could be difficult when her personal beliefs did not match 
policy.

But in a wide-ranging interview, she also said she had 
deliberately cut down on drinking wine since her appointment because of 
official guidelines.

She said: ‘I have never hidden the fact I enjoy
 a glass of wine but I try not to be photographed now with one, and I do
 drink less because I have read the evidence and I am persuaded of it .’

Dame
 Sally, who lives with her third husband and their two daughters in 
Islington, North London, was named as the sixth most powerful woman in 
Britain by BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour in February.

A Department of 
Health spokesman said: ‘The UK approach is to consider drug use as both a
 health and criminal issue and so the chief medical officer is not 
saying anything new.’
