Nobody spoke English like Sir Donald Sinden. The actor, who has died aged 90, was the last and greatest of a generation that sounded every consonant of every word.

This theatrical knight confessed that three things made his blood boil: vandalism, litter and the misuse of the English language.

It gets me so cross,’ he would say, ‘the way the ends of words are never pronounced, like “yeah” instead of “yes”.’

Donald Sinden, who played Chief Officer Shawe-Wilson in The Captain's Table, died on Thursday aged 90

He won fame as a leading man in the golden age of British cinema, as a light comedian, as a Shakespearian orator, in TV sitcom and as a West End star

His resonant tones made him a booming success in every branch of acting. He won fame as a leading man in the golden age of British cinema, as a light comedian, as a Shakespearian orator, in TV sitcom and as a West End star.

That fruity — many would say hammy — voice was unmistakable.

As Malvolio in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, he delivered the classic line ‘Some have greatness thrust upon ’em,’ exaggerating every syllable — ‘Sommme! Have Grrreat-Nesss! Therrrustt! Upp On ’Emmm!’

But he lacked the obsessive drive of contemporaries such as Laurence Olivier or Dickie Attenborough — rather than making epics or winning Oscars, Sinden preferred to potter around English churches, taking notes on their architecture, or to explore Italy by car with his beloved wife, Diana.

Born in 1923, the son of a chemist in Ditchling, in Sussex, he suffered from asthma throughout his childhood, and left school at 15 to be apprenticed to a shopfitter. With his wheezy voice, acting had never occurred to him, but at the outbreak of war his cousin, an amateur actor, was called up and Donald became his stand-in for an am-dram production in Brighton.

To his surprise, he was a natural. He was talent-spotted by the director of a wartime entertainment unit, and spent the rest of the war learning joinery in the workshop each day and touring Army training camps and anti-aircraft batteries each evening.

‘I was either brilliant, or they couldn’t find anyone else,’ he joked.

When his own call-up papers came, he was ruled medically unfit for duty owing to his asthma. So he entertained the troops — in 1945, he toured Europe and India with ENSA, the Entertainments National Service Association (also known as Every Night Something Awful).

Then he trained at the Webber Douglas drama school in London, where voice coaches helped him develop his thundering bass delivery, with syllables that sounded like lumps of falling masonry.

He met Diana Mahony after earning a place at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon as an understudy. Diana was playing Helen of Troy in Dr Faustus, and Ceres in The Tempest. ‘She had a line in goddesses that season,’ Sinden said. ‘She was a classical-looking lady, statuesque and beautiful.’

The first time he proposed, by moonlight on a bridge over the Avon, she declined. But he persevered, and they married in 1948.

Diana gave up her career to raise their family: they had two children, Jeremy and Marc, both actors. The devoted couple were together for more than 55 years until Diana’s death from cancer, aged 77, in 2004.

While she had been caring for their babies, Donald tirelessly made his name as an actor. In a 19-month run during the late Forties at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in The Heiress, he never missed a show.

The management gave him an engraved silver ashtray to mark his achievement of giving more consecutive performances than any other actor in the theatre’s history. The ashtray was appropriate — despite his asthma, Sinden would for much of his life puff through two or more packs a day.

His cinema breakthrough came in 1953 with an adaptation of The Cruel Sea, Nicholas Monsarrat’s novel about the battle between the Navy and German U-boats hunting Atlantic convoys during World War II.

Jack Hawkins, then the country’s biggest star, was the commander of a sub-hunter, and newcomer Sinden was his brave but inexperienced junior, in a father-son relationship that many film buffs believe would have earned them Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, had the movie been made in Hollywood.

The honours went to On The Waterfront with Marlon Brando, the mumbling, slurring antithesis of everything Sinden stood for.

His loathing of ‘Method’ acting won Sinden an unexpected admirer, Marilyn Monroe. Their dressing rooms at Pinewood studios were four doors apart while she was filming The Prince And the Showgirl, and he another movie, and Sinden mocked her attempts at Brando-style naturalism.

He hung a sign on his door advertising his own drama classes, guaranteed to out-do the Method: ‘You too can be inaudible! “Ums” and “Ers” rendered obsolete!’

Monroe saw the joke and started dropping in, not for acting lessons but to offload her troubles. ‘She popped in for a natter and a giggle,’ Sinden said. ‘Of course as a sex symbol she was stunning, but sadly, she must be one of the silliest women I have ever met.’

 Accolades were heaped on him for Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, in which he acted with Judi Dench, and for his King Lear

The Cruel Sea was followed by another war classic, Above Us The Waves, as well as lighter films, like The Captain’s Table, You Know What Sailors Are and the romantic farce Doctor In The House.

Sinden played Tony Benskin, the eternal medical student who spends his time boozing and chasing nurses. When he saw a girl he liked, Benskin, instead of wolf-whistling, would emit a gutteral growl.

This sexy-but-safe persona won him stardom, and he was voted the face British housewives would most like to see across their breakfast tables. But it also prevented him from being taken seriously.

When a sex scandal forced Britain’s highest-paid TV star Leslie Phillips out of his hit ITV sitcom, Our Man At St Mark’s in 1963, the lovable but harmless Sinden was the obvious choice to take over.

He became so disillusioned at the way film producers refused to cast him in serious roles that he quit his contact with Rank studios and returned to Stratford. Under director Peter Hall he played the Duke of York in The Wars Of The Roses, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henry VI trilogy, and took the play to the West End. It was a triumph.

He followed that with a Restoration comedy, The Relapse, as the ludicrously camp Lord Foppington, with rosebud lips and an orange head-dress based on wigs worn by female impersonator Danny La Rue.

Accolades were heaped on him for Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, in which he acted with Judi Dench, and for his King Lear.

In 1979 he became the last white actor to play Othello at Stratford with his face blackened. It’s a performance I was lucky enough to see: he was heartfelt and tragic as the African general who kills his wife in a jealous rage. But the black-and-white minstrel’s make-up, contrasted with the plummy vowels, seemed too dated to be taken seriously.

Though not yet 60, Sinden sensed that his era in the theatre was passing. He fell back on television, as Elaine Stritch’s butler in Two’s Company and as an antiques dealer in Never The Twain, which ran for ten years. It became a family affair: sons Jeremy and Marc played police officers in one episode, while Diana was in the final show.

His passion for religious architecture led him to present a BBC documentary series in 1988, The English Country Church, in which his delivery was so orotund and opulent that he earned his own puppet on Spitting Image.

His character was usually seen pleading for a knighthood (the real one arrived in 1997). And at a restaurant, the Sinden puppet summoned a waiter and boomed: ‘Do you serve a ham salad?’ Yes, came the reply — they served salad to anyone.

He and Diana were devastated by the death of Jeremy, aged 45, from cancer in 1996. Donald continued to work in television, but his great pleasure in later life was to regale friends at the Garrick Club with theatrical anecdotes — and the printable ones were collected into an Everyman book.

His voice came to be known as the defining sound of the Garrick. It was the sound of a vanished age of English theatre, too. No actor will ever again declaim his lines with such majesty as Donald Sinden.
