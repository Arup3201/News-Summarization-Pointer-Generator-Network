Alan Irvine had only just made the double substitution which would see home the three points on his managerial debut in the Premier League.

Within 60 seconds, however, his side had surrendered their lead and the new manager's winning start was gone.

Saido Berahino's double had fired Irvine to within five minutes of victory after Lee Cattermole's stunning opener for the visitors.

But, with West Brom still readjusting following Irvine's changes, Seb Larsson pounced to earn a deserved point for Gus Poyet's side.

'I'm disappointed really,' said Irvine, a surprise appointment at the Hawthorns during the summer.

'I felt there were a lot of good things. It was a great response to going behind. We controlled the first half and we had a lot of momentum, we didn't want half-time to come.

'But having got ourselves in front I hoped – and expected – us to stay in front.'

Irvine's double change saw former Sunderland midfielder Craig Gardner and Graham Dorrans replaced by Chris Baird and Stephane Sessegnon.

And Irvine explained: 'Craig had cramp and that comes because of nervous energy playing against Sunderland in his first game and so forth.

'Dorrans had done an awful lot of work and looked as if he was beginning to struggle.

'So those were the reasons (for the changes).'

Cattermole's strike arrived after just four minutes. West Brom could only half clear from a set-piece and the ball bounced invitingly to his feet 30 yards out. With one touch to set himself, the anchorman took aim for the top corner and duly located it in stunning fashion. It was his second goal in six years having only broken that duck at Spurs in April.

The hosts were awarded what Irvine admitted was a 'soft' penalty before the break when Victor Anichebe toppled under minimal contact from Valentin Roberge and Berahino converted.

Sunderland's Jack Rodwell – a £10m signing from Manchester City last week – was making his bow in an advanced midfield role but failed to impact and it was no surprise when he was withdrawn midway through the second period.

Rodwell's role was occupied by Gardner at the Stadium of Light last season and it was he who laid on West Brom's second. Vito Mannone should have done better when stooping to save Dorrans' low strike from distance and his spill allowed Gardner to dig out a cross to the far post where Berahino was steaming in to volley home.

Berahino was the chief threat throughout for the Baggies and Irvine expects the 21-year-old to remain at the club beyond this month.

'I can't see anyway that this club would be interested in letting Saido go,' said Irvine. 'You can't let top, English, talented players go. This could be a very big season for him and beyond.'

Poyet, meanwhile, was encouraged by the manner of his side's comeback which was secured when Patrick van Aanholt was sprung clear by Jordi Gomez and he squared for Larsson to side-foot beyond Ben Foster.

'We had a great start and it was a great goal,' said the Uruguayan.

'Then we had 25 minutes which were a technical disaster. We couldn't pass the ball.

'We were much better in the second half and more aggressive.

'Maybe last year, after conceding the second goal, we would have collapsed and conceded three or four but we have a better and stronger mentality in the team.

'That's a good sign for the future.'
