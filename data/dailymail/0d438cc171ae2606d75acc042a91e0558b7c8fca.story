Pixie the puppy was dumped alone and in agony after being shot with an air rifle by sadistic thugs.

But despite having her leg amputated, the five-month-old kelpie is now making a good recovery after she was found by two teenagers in Woodridge, about 80km north of Perth.

The dog is just one of 261 cases of animal cruelty seen by the RSPCA, in Western Australia. Officials say that there has been a significant increase in attacks in Western Australia since November.

About two weeks ago Pixie the kelpie had her leg amputated after she was shot with air rifle

Other examples seen in just two weeks include a duck and cat who had been shot with crossbows, and a horse injured by a shotgun. 

Unfortunately the duck had to be euthanised, but the cat and the horse are on the mend.

RSPCA chief inspector Amanda Swift said these attacks had a long-term and devastating effect on animals.

The five-month-old was found with an injured leg by two teenage girls who were riding quad bikes about 80km north of Perth

'No excuse or reason is acceptable for the deliberate cruelty to animals that we are seeing and those that are caught will find themselves in trouble with the law,' she said.

Since November, there has been a 105 percent increase from 127 cases in the previous six-month period in WA.

Incidents included dogs, cats, sheep, chickens and wildlife being been bashed, tortured, kicked or struck.

Unlike some cases, Pixie had a happy ending.

After being taken in by the RSPCA, X-rays revealed she had a pellet from an air rifle lodged in her left shoulder blade.

She had to have her leg amputated but - to the astonishment of the RSPCA - was able to walk again just two days after surgery.

She is now living with Quinns Rocks couple Terry and Sandra Williams.

The couple had not planned to welcome another dog into the house after the death of their beloved 14-year-old dog Oops died.

But when they heard Pixie's story they contacted the RSPCA and met her the next day.

'We knew then that she was the dog for us, she was just adorable,' Mr Williams said. 

'She had all the usual naughty puppy traits, but had a very lovely nature and it was amazing to think that only 12 days prior to us seeing her that she had been found alone and in pain by two young girls who rescued her.'

The Williams said Pixie was settling in well into her new home.

'Once she had settled in she got up to mischief,' Mr Williams said.

This duck found near Albany in WA unfortunately did not survive after being shot by an arrow within two weeks after Pixie was found

Found in Perth, this cat luckily survived after it was shot with an arrow - one of the incidents RSPCA WA has been called to since a surge in animal cruelty numbers

'She learned very quickly how to get up onto the kitchen bench from the couch and help herself to her dog treats.

'We were surprised how intelligent and affectionate she is and it looks like she was house trained at some point.'

RSPCA WA did put out a call for witnesses to find out who shot Pixie with an air rifle, but no one has come forward.

Seven cases of animal cruelty are about to go before the courts across Australia that the RSPCA classes as 'disturbing'.

The RSPCA is holding its biggest fundraising event, the Million Paws Walk, across the state on Sunday.

A shotgun caused the injuries to this horse found in Baldivis, south of Perth, on April 29. The horse has recovered
