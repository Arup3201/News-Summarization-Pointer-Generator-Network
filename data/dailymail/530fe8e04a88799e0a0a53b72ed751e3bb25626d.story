The widow of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev left her parents home wearing a traditional Muslim headscarf today - countering reports that she has turned her back on her adopted religion.

Katherine Russell, or Karima Tsarnaeva by her married name, is living at her 
parents' home in Rhode Island with her daughter by the terrorist.

According to reports, her Christian parents have been encouraging her to turn her back on the religion she adopted when she married Tsarnaev, a Chechen who encouraged his wife to join him in a strict interpretation of his faith.

However, the 24-year-old countered any suggestion they had won her over today - leaving their suburban home fully covered and wearing a headscarf.

A report by the National Enquirer earlier this week said she had been been turned away from the religion since her husband's death in the bombings he allegedly perpetuated alongside younger brother Dzhokhar. 

'Katherine is slowly starting to change,' a source told the National Enquirer, adding that she is already wearing fingernail polish and eating at fast food restaurants.

She also changed her name back to Katherine Russell, according to the report.

However, if she is converting back to Christianity it is indeed happening slowly, according to her appearance this morning.

The young mom was seen getting into a car with her 2-year-old daughter.

Daughter: Katherine Russell's little girl, also the daughter of Tamerlan Tsarnaev watched as her grandmother prepared her car seat

Grandmother: Judith Russell, Katherine Russell's mother was pictured loading her granddaughter in the car

Covered up: Reports previously claimed the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev was giving up her adopted religion in the wake of her death and terror attack on Boston

Her mother Judith loaded the vehicle with a child seat wearing a t-shirt and shorts.

Katherine then emerged wearing sunglasses, carrying her keys and a can of soda cutting a stark contrast to her mother's summery look with her body fully covered in a floor length purple skirt and black long sleeve jumper.

It had previously been reported that she drastically changed after meeting Tsarnaev while at a club during her college years.

'Katherine was completely sub­servient to him,' a source told the Enquirer. 'She cowered around him.'

She is cooperating with officials in 
the investigation, but claims she had no idea her husband was plotting 
to bomb the Boston marathon as she was working 80 hours a week as a 
health care aide.

She has not been accused of any 
wrongdoing, but the FBI have questioned her to find out if 
she had any clue as to her husband's plans.

The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260.

Tsarnaev
and his brother Dzhokhar are believed to 
have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs.

Her lawyer Joshue Dratel, from New York, said that he joined Russell's legal team 
to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her 
interests.

He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating.

'I
don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's 
no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.'

She was widowed when Tamer­lan was killed in a police shootout on April 19 – four days after he and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly set off bombs during the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed in the cowardly attack and 264 more were wounded, sev­eral of whom lost limbs.

Dzhokhar, 19, is in a prison hospital
facing charges that could bring the death penalty. Tamerlan, 26, died 
on April 19 after a shootout with police.

Russell,
24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband and 
two-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North 
Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed.

Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it.

Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband.

One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.
