The Deputy leader of the Opposition has made a passionate plea for the lives of the Bali Nine ringleaders on death row in Indonesia to be spared by highlighting her own husband's drug reform story.

Tanya Plibersek's husband Michael Coutts-Trotter  was convicted of conspiracy to import drugs in 1986, at the age of 21, and served three years of a nine-year prison sentence.  

He has turned his life around and is now Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services.

Meanwhile, Sydney men Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, are due to face a firing squad this month after they were convicted of heroin trafficking in Indonesia in 2006.

They have already spent nine years in jail for a crime they committed when they were in their early twenties and could be executed by firing squad any day now.

'In 1988, my husband left prison after being charged and convicted of a similar crime to these young men. I imagine what would have happened if he had been caught in Thailand instead of in Australia where that crime was committed, where he was coming back to Australia,' Ms Plibersek said in Parliament on Thursday. 

'I think about – I didn't know him at the time, this is 30 years ago – what would the world have missed out on? They would have missed out on the three beautiful children we have had together. They would have missed out on a man who spent the rest of his life making amends for the crime that he committed,' she added.

Despite lawyers arguing they are reformed men and mounting international pressure against their execution, Indonesia's president has refused to grant Chan and Sukumaran pardons. Legal appeals against their sentence have also repeatedly been quashed.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been in an Indonesian jail since 2006 and are facing execution in the next month

'We need to have a principled and methodical approach to punishments of serious crime. I perhaps have a particular view on remorse and redemption because of experiences in my own life.

In 1988, my husband left prison after being charged and convicted of a similar crime to these young men. I imagine what would have happened if he had been caught in Thailand instead of in Australia where that crime was committed, where he was coming back to Australia. I think about – I didn’t know him at the time, this is 30 years ago – what would the world have missed out on? They would have missed out on the three beautiful children we have had together. They would have missed out on a man who spent the rest of his life making amends for the crime that he committed.

I have another perspective on this, too. In 1997, I lost my brother to a violent crime in Port Moresby. I know that if I had been the one making the decision about the punishment of the person who did that crime, I couldn’t have thought of a punishment bad enough.

That’s why we don’t make decisions about punishment on the basis of how we feel but on the basis of universal, consistently-applied rules. I think it is important to say that when it comes to the death penalty, there has been for many years in Australia a bipartisan rejection of the death penalty.'

Mr Coutts-Trotter, now a high-level public servant, said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia his experience was no where near as difficult as that faced by Chan and Sukumaran or their families and he doesn't want to disrespect them by suggesting otherwise.

'Like a great many Australians I oppose the death penalty,' he said.

'These two young men have done serious wrong and should be punished with substantial gaol terms. But they should be granted mercy and not death.

'Alive in gaol Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have the chance – and the obligation - to make amends and regain their dignity by serving others. And their families have the chance to love and support them to do so.

'From all reports, they would work their lives through to repay that generosity,' Mr Coutts-Trotter reasoned.

'I was afforded a second chance by our Australian justice system. I remain grateful for that every day.'

Ms Plibersek spoke in parliament in support of Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who says the execution of the Bali nine ringleaders would be a grave injustice.

An emotional Ms Bishop also made a speech in parliament on Thursday to plead for the lives of Chan and Sukumaran.

Australia was not seeking to understate the gravity of their crimes, but the death penalty was a bridge too far, she said.

'This motion goes to the heart of what we believe will be a grave injustice against two Australian citizens facing execution in Indonesia,' she told the lower house.

'Without doubt, Andrew and Myuran need to pay for their crimes with lengthy jail sentences but they should not need to pay with their lives.'

Ms Plibersek said capital punishment 'barbarised' the executioner, while speaking in parliament

Ms Bishop said more than 30,000 Australians have implored the Indonesian president and members of the Indonesian government for a stay of their executions.

Her shared hope with those petitioners was for the Indonesian government to show mercy, she said.

'I believe it is Indonesia that will lose the most from executing these two young men,' she said.

No country had done as much as Australia to support Indonesia in fighting drug-related crime, Ms Bishop said.

Ms Plibersek said capital punishment 'barbarised' the executioner.

'It's left over from an earlier and more barbaric time,' she said.

She said she remained hopeful the Indonesian government would show clemency and order a stay of execution.
