Robin van Persie is making the most of a three-week break afforded to him by new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

Van Persie was given a significant rest period after helping Van Gaal's Holland to third place in the World Cup.

And the 30-year-striker was pictured relaxing with his children at the beach in Barbados on Tuesday, just two days after the squad flew back to Holland.

Van Gaal, who has stepped down as Holland manager, is not taking a holiday himself, preferring to fly with his new team to the United States for their tour starting on Friday.

The touring party includes Wayne Rooney and other England squad members after the Three Lions were eliminated at the group stage of the World Cup.

Van Persie scored four goals as Holland were eliminated at the semi-final stage before beating hosts Brazil in the third-place play-off.
