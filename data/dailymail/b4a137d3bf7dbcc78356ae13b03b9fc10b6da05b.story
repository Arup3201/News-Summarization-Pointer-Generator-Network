France is to introduce brandless cigarette packets and ban advertising for electronic cigarettes under new health ministry measures aimed at stubbing out smoking among young people.

Health Minister Marisol Touraine said her anti-smoking plan,
to be introduced over two years, aimed to produce
France's first generation of non-smokers by the mid-2030s.
Currently, about 30 per cent of the population are smokers.

Among the boldest moves is the introduction of plain
packaging for cigarettes, on which distinctive advertising is
banned and the brand is written in small lettering under a
graphic health warning.

France is to introduce brandless cigarette packets under an ambitions plan aimed at creating a 'non-smoking' generation

Under the plan, all cigarette packets will be the same size and colour and will contain graphic health warnings

As in Australia, which pioneered plain packaging in 2012 and
has reported a rise in calls to hotlines for people wanting to
quit, all packets sold will be of the same size and same colour.

The French government will also forbid smoking in cars with
children under the age of 12, ban smoking in areas commonly
frequented by children and stop advertising for electronic
cigarettes by May, 2016.

Ms Touraine said: 'We have set an ambitious goal: to succeed in making
children born today the first 'non-smoking' generation in 20
years.'

Smoking will also be banned in cars containing children under the age of 12, and in areas commonly frequented by young people

France has long been known as a paradise for smokers due to
its cafe culture, national brands like the 'Gauloises' - no longer
produced in France - and 1960s 'Nouvelle Vague' films in which
characters lit up constantly.

While smoking has declined sharply since the 1960s, in
keeping with a trend across the West, the government said 73,000
people per year still died from tobacco-related causes - 20
times more than in road accidents.
