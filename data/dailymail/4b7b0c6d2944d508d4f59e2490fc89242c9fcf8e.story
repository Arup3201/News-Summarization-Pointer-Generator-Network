Evidence: Dr Freddy Patel, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court today, carried out the first post-mortem on Ian Tomlinson two days after his death during the G20 protests in 2009

The pathologist who examined the body of Ian Tomlinson threw evidence down the sink as he had already made up his mind about the cause of death, a court heard today.

Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Freddy Patel, 64, carried out the first post-mortem on Mr Tomlinson on April 3, 2009 - two days after his death during the G20 protests in the City of London.

His findings led to the official line that the newspaper vendor had died of natural causes in the form of a heart attack.

This theory was only questioned when footage later emerged of PC Simon Harwood hitting Mr Tomlinson with a baton and shoving him to the floor. The father-of-nine collapsed minutes later.

Two subsequent post-mortems involving three pathologists concluded that Mr Tomlinson had been killed by internal bleeding caused by a liver injury, the hearing at Southwark Crown Court was told.

Harwood denies manslaughter, claiming that his actions were ‘necessary, proportionate and reasonable’ in the circumstances.

Prosecutor Mark Dennis today questioned whether Dr Patel had given proper consideration to the three litres of 'internal abdominal fluid blood' - which he later threw down the sink - and blood clots found in Mr Tomlinson’s stomach cavity.

Other doctors believe this came from internal bleeding caused when Harwood attacked the 47-year-old as he walked away with his hands in his pockets.

When asked how much attention he gave to the plum-coloured liquid, Dr Patel said: 'My impression was that there was more body fluid than blood. 

'Having done my examination and having come to a cause of death in my mind it was obvious it couldn’t be three litres of blood, if it was three litres of blood I wouldn’t have given the cause of death that I did.'

Mr Dennis, who pointed out the fluid had been 'poured down the drain into the mortuary sink', replied: 'Slight chicken and egg problem there Mr Patel. On that day did you not see any need to keep the three litres of liquid, blood, fluid, so it could be checked to see what mix it was?'

Dr Patel said: 'I didn’t keep it, it is not the thing that is kept by pathologists.'

But he admitted that the fluid could have been tested by other professionals to see how much of it was blood, if he had not thrown it away.

Dr Patel was asked if he stood by his findings.

He replied: 'Yes, I do. I have been searching other experts and pathologists for other evidence that would persuade me to believe that death was due to internal haemorrhage and if that was the case I would be the first one to rectify the matter.'

Despite three other pathologists discrediting his findings, Dr Patel told the hearing that he still believed his ruling was correct.

He said: 'I actually saw the blood mix and secondly having examined the body looking for injuries that could be caused by significant blood loss and there was none.'

Spots found on the liver could not have produced enough blood to kill Mr Tomlinson and any injury he received from Harwood could not have caused him to collapse and die minutes later, Dr Patel said.

At the request of the police and coroner he had looked specifically for 'assault crush injuries associated with public disorder' but the footage had not emerged.

The court was previously shown film footage of the moment Mr Tomlinson journey that day using video from he walked past PC Simon Harwood - who is primed in a strike position behind him

Externally he found a superficial cut
above Mr Tomlinson’s right eyebrow and bruises and grazes to his legs 
and knees, including a large 14cm by 6cm bruise to his thigh thought to 
have been caused by the baton strike.

But
his 2009 report concluded: 'There were no defence injuries, no crush 
injuries and no significant marks of violence from assault or forceful 
restraint.'

Dr Patel, who 
maintained that the bruises were not related to death, added today: 'At 
the time of my examination there was no mention of a baton strike.'

Other
bruises and a 'pattern mark' to the back of his leg could be attributed
to impact when he collapsed and were not consistent with bites from a 
police dog, he said.

Internal fractures to the ribs and bruising were likely to have been caused during resuscitation.

Mr
Tomlinson showed signs of alcoholism and chronic liver disorder which 
Dr Patel concluded could have caused the internal bleeding. 

He
found severe atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, was the 
'most significant pathological evidence' and therefore recorded a cause 
of death as a heart attack.

The court previously heard that Harwood 
was bristling with aggression after a protester had scrawled ‘all cops 
are b*******’ on a police carrier. The prosecution compared the policeman to a thug.

Harwood denies manslaughter. The trial continues.
