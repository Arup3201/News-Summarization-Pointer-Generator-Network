Riot police kept anti-immigrant protestors away from their rivals today as tensions remained high on the streets of Calais.

A group called ‘Sauvons Calais’ (Save Calais) displayed their opposition to some 2,000 foreigners living around the port as they try to get to Britain.

Meanwhile, it was revealed that the Government will offer to improve security by sending Calais officials the 9ft-high steel fences used to protect world leaders at last week’s Nato summit in Wales.

More than 12 miles of fencing was set up around venues for the summit in Newport and Cardiff, and the Home Office says this is much stronger than the current barriers in place at the French port.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told The Sunday Telegraph that Britain would help by sending the fences, but warned it is up to the French to secure the port against illegal migrants.

The Sauvons Calais meeting today took place in front of the town hall, where some 300 police officers formed a ring of steel.

At one point, left-wing activists tried to attack the demonstration, leading to an uneasy stand-off between the two groups.

‘Left-wing scum are trying to stop us speaking up for the people of Calais,’ said Kevin Reche, a former member of the French National Front who was kicked out of the party for making a Nazi salute.

‘There are all kinds of people demonstrating for a safe Calais – from the far right, to those without any political views. We are all calling for justice.’

There were some 250 people at the anti-immigration rally, including skinheads with White Power flags.

One wore a T-shirt saying ‘Charlemagne 1944’, in reference to a Second World War Nazi division made up entirely of French volunteers.

‘Heil-Hitler’ salutes also appeared 
to be made by around ten demonstrators during the stand-off with their 
opponents, but organisers claimed they were just being used to mock the 
‘left wing fascists’.

There were also more moderate voices among those objecting to the presence of the migrants in Calais.

‘We just want a better future for own children,’ said Noelle Richard, 46, who was with her schoolgirl daughter.

‘Having lots of young men sleeping 
rough in the town makes for a very unpleasant atmosphere. There is 
always a great deal of trouble at all times of the day and night.’

The protests came as former home 
secretary Michael Howard, now Lord Howard, said France needed to ‘get 
its act together’ to deal with the growing crisis.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has
 threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly 
Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry last Wednesday.

Mrs
 Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to
 deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally.

French
 nationalists, including many supporters of Marine Le Pen’s increasingly
 successful National Front party, want more direct action.

‘That’s why we’re in Calais,’ said Gilles Baudin, one of those preparing to march.

‘Police are already warning of 
violence, but if there is any, it will come from the immigrants who are 
destroying a once great French town.

‘These people should be cleared out - we don’t care where they go, but we don’t want them in our country.’

Denis Gaudin, sub-prefect for the Calais area, said the route of the march had already been switched ‘for security reasons’.

Mr
 Gaudin said there was a ‘fraught climate’ in the town – one that was 
likely to explode into violence if the demonstrators got near the 
migrants.

In turn, immigrant Lola Welday, a 40-year-old from Eritrea, said: ‘I have children here, and all we want is to be protected.

‘We are peaceful people, and all we 
want is a new life in England – we want to live and prosper there in 
peace. We get trouble from the French police, but what we really need is
 increased protection.’

Lola and her daughter, Kidan, six, 
were among 200 migrants who themselves marched through Calais on Friday 
chanting ‘UK, UK - We want to go to the UK’, and ‘We demand our human 
rights’.

Sauvons Calais is demanding that the migrants are expelled from the Calais area, and that anyone sheltering or feeing them is arrested.

There have already been attacks on squatters in Calais, and some temporary camps have been illegally burned down.

Sauvons Calais will deploy a ‘security detail’ today aimed at countering the threat of a ‘far left rabble,’ according to one organiser, although he insisted ‘we will not cause any trouble’.

Mrs Bouchart said: ‘My proposal to block the port still remains. We are sick of being ignored. Those of us living in Calais have been in this situation for 12 years.

‘Until now we have had no help, no 
word of compassion and no support. It is time for the UK government to 
face up to its responsibilities, otherwise this crisis will just go on 
and on.’

Britain’s ‘soft’ immigration policy means it is viewed as ‘El Dorado’, said Mrs Bouchard.

She
 has also demanded that the UK Border Force’s frontline passport check, 
which has been inside the port of Calais for more than a decade, should 
be moved back to Dover.

The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out in other Channel ports including Dunkirk and Cherbourg.

All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries so as to get to the UK, where they will claim asylum or disappear into the black economy.

What migrants chanted on Friday

The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have travelled from north Africa to mainland Europe, usually through Italy.

Violent clashes between rival migrant groups and people smugglers have also broken out in the town.

According to the Calais Prefecture, 7,414 undocumented migrants were arrested in Calais in the first six months of this year, compared with the 3,129 detained in the same period of 2013.

Some 400 would-be stowaways were caught by French police last weekend alone. Those caught are then released, so they are free to try again and again until they succeed.
