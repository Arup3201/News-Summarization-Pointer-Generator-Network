Today around the world fireworks will be ringing in the new year as people celebrate the beginning of 2015.

But in a week the solar system will put on a light show of its own, when a comet passes close to Earth’s orbit.

In fact, comet Lovejoy will come so close that it will be visible to the naked eye - but you'll want to get a look at it soon, as it won’t return again for 8,000 years.

People in the UK and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere will be treated to a cosmic light show early in the new year. On 7 January 2015 comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), pictured by astronomer Dieter Willasch on 28 Dec, will make its closest approach to Earth. It will be visible to observers on Earth near the constellation of Orion

The comet, formally designated C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), was discovered by amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy from Queensland, Australia.

On 7 January 2015 it will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) - although it is already visible in the night sky.

It will make its closest approach to the sun on 30 January at a distance of 1.29 AU (one astronomical unit - AU - is the distance from Earth to the sun) before heading back out of the solar system. 

The remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of Orion according to Slate's Phil Plait, which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky.

It will then make its way past the Taurus and the Pleiades constellations. The comet's position in the sky can be tracked on various websites such as Sky and Telescope.

In photos of the comet taken so far it appears green, which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight. 

Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains how to spot the comet in the night sky:

'Comet Lovejoy (C/2014 Q2) is growing in brightness and will hit a magnitude of +4.1 in the first two weeks of the new year.

'A magnitude of +4.1 is just over 100 times dimmer than the brightest star in Earth's entire night time sky (Sirius). The more positive the number, the lower the magnitude and the dimmer an object is.

'The comet is currently at a magnitude of around +5.0, meaning that it is an ideal target for those who have received a telescope or pair of binoculars for Christmas. 

'The comet is much more favourable for Northern Hemisphere observers. It was a Southern Hemisphere target, but it's leaving their skies now. To observe it, late evening is best, around 10.30pm GMT.

'It's climbing higher and higher in the sky as the nights go on, so by 5 January, you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark.'

'Even in a pair of 10x50 binoculars and under moderate suburban light pollution, comet Lovejoy appears as a faint, white smudge. If conditions are much more favourable however, you should be able to make out a bit of shape to the comet, particularly at the centre - albeit only just!

'Again, the darker the skies and the better your optical aid, the more you will see. You may even be able to pick out the stunning greenish tint of the comet, but astrophotography will make this much more apparent.

'Comet Lovejoy  is close to the southern section of the constellation Lupus (The Hare) and will begin to make its way through the constellation of Eridanus as we head into the new year.

'By 5 January, the comet will be higher in the sky and, despite a full moon in the constellation Gemini (The Twins), will be easily identifiable to the right of the brightest star in the constellation Orion, Rigel.

'Tonight, a waxing gibbous moon will make its appearance, providing a degree of interference in observing the comet. However, using a decent pair of binoculars with a magnification of at least 10x50 combined with a southern horizon that’s free of light pollution will provide an ideal opportunity to catch the comet.

The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign.

In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green. 

To the naked eye, though, the comet will appear grey; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration. 

The comet is particularly interesting because it is a long period comet - one that originates in the most outer reaches of the solar system, the Oort cloud.

Here, icy remnants of the young solar system orbit in a vast cloud, occasionally make long journeys into the inner solar system.

On rare occasions these comets are visible from Earth, like Lovejoy will be, before heading back out on extremely long orbits.

On 7 January 2015 it will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km), shown in this illustration. The comet is actually approaching from 'below' Earth's orbital plane, though, so in this 2D image it looks like it is not actually at its closest point - but it is

In photos of the comet taken so far it appears green, which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight. To the naked eye, though, the comet will appear grey; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration. It is pictured here by astronomer Paul Stewart on 27 December

This one, for instance, has an orbital period of 8,000 years - so it won’t return until about 10015 AD, if anyone is still around to see it.

Its orbit takes it out to a distance of about 90 billion kilometres (56 billion miles) - more than 20 times the distance of the sun to Neptune.

Its orbital period was actually originally longer, about 11,500 years, but gravitational effects from the planets have shortened its orbit.

The remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of Orion, seen here, which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky. It will then make its way past the Taurus and the Pleiades constellations before beginning its journey back out of the solar system

The comet is seen here in a picture by astronomer Graham Bowes. The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign. In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green

The comet was first discovered by Mr Lovejoy on 17 August this year.

Initially, it hadn’t been expected to get very bright but, as it approached the sun it began to brighten considerably as the sun melted its icy surface. 

And If the name ‘Comet Lovejoy’ rings a bell, that’s because Mr Lovejoy has discovered four similar comets before.

One of the most famous was Comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), which made a close approach to Earth in 2011 and was observed by many observers - even astronauts on the ISS - above Earth.

ISS Commander Dan Burbank captured spectacular imagery of 2011's comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) from about 240 miles (384km) above Earth’s horizon on 21 December 2011. Burbank described seeing the comet as 'the most amazing thing I have ever seen in space'
