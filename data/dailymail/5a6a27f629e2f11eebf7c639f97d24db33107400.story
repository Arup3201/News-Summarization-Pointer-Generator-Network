A Texas father was arrested Thursday after his car was towed with his children in the back seat.

Victor Ruiz, of Houston, TX, left his two children in the car while running inside with groceries. Gone for only a minute, he returned to find his car had been towed with the two young girls still inside.

The tow truck driver didn’t notice the children in the car until he was two miles away.

Neighbors claim they repeatedly told the tow truck driver that children were in the car.

‘I'm like wait!  Them kids in the car. He snapped the picture and hurry up and sped off with these peoples' cars,’ neighbor Shade Jones told KPRC.

Ms. Jones backed Mr. Ruiz’s claim that he was only inside for a minute.

‘When he pulled into the apartments, he hurried up and hooked his thing on the car,’ she said.

The driver pulled over to the side of the road and called the police. Officials arrested Mr. Ruiz and charged him with two counts of abandoning a child.

The children weren’t returned home until about 2:00am, according to KPRC.

Ms. Jones told the station she was confused by the charges brought against Mr. Ruiz.

‘How did he abandon a child if a whole bunch of people was around watching his car?’

Mr. Ruiz is sitting in a Houston jail on a $4,000 bond.
