Police Minister Damian Green made the warning as he promised new action to clamp down on offenders from overseas

The number of crimes committed by foreign criminals is ‘sizeable and increasing’, a minister warned yesterday.

Police Minister Damian Green made the warning as he promised new action to clamp down on offenders from overseas.

He pointed to figures showing more than 74,000 foreign national offenders were arrested in London in a single year.

David Cameron has personally pledged to deport more foreign criminals from Britain.

But human rights laws, foreign countries’ refusal to accept their own nationals and delays in getting travel documents mean many dangerous offenders are allowed to stay in the country.

In London, the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Nexus has seen immigration officials based in police stations so swift action can be taken when foreign criminals are arrest.

The operation has seen more than 1,000 foreign offenders deported in the past 18 months.

But Mr Green said the scale of offending by foreign nationals outside the capital was ‘less well understood’.

In a speech to Police and Crime Commissioners in London on Tuesday, Mr Green said: ‘The level of crime in England and Wales committed by foreign nationals is sizeable and increasing.

‘In 2011/12 the Metropolitan Police arrested over 74,000 foreign national offenders.

‘The scale of the challenge is less well understood outside London. But we are building that evidence for the rest of the country and will share it as soon as we can to help you deal with the problem more effectively.’ 

He added: ‘This is not about picking on people because they are not from the UK.

‘Foreign national offenders are first and foremost criminals. The fact that they are not UK nationals provides us with other options for dealing with them.’

In coming months, the Met scheme is set to be extended across the country in an effort to throw out more foreign criminals.

Officials will identify and process foreign suspects as soon as they are arrested, checking whether they are wanted abroad or are here illegally.

Computer records of suspected serious offenders will be marked with a ‘red flag’ to prevent them applying for British nationality while they go through the courts.

An Immigration Bill currently before Parliament will reduce the ability of foreign criminals to use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act - the right to a private and family life - to stay in Britain.

Criminals could also be deported first and forced to conduct their appeals from abroad.

Last week it emerged that a violent street gang ‘general’ who poses a serious threat to the public has been let out on bail, because immigration officials cannot work out where he is from.

Joland Giwa, whose street name is Dexter, is a notorious gangster from Croydon, south London, who was behind bars for a string of street robberies.

He was kept inside for four years after serving his sentence as efforts were made to deport him. But officials were unable to get him a passport because they couldn’t be sure where he was from.

He was released on a tag in December told to live in South Wales and to stay away from London.

Figures show up to one in four organised criminals targeting Britain is from overseas.

There are around 11,000 foreign offenders in the country’s prison system - costing taxpayers more than £300million a year.

The total number deported has fallen by 14 per cent in four years.

Some 5,528 were removed in the final quarter of 2009, compared to 4,730 between April and June last year.

In 2012, the Prime Minister said: ‘When people are sent to prison we should do everything to make sure that if they’re foreign, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence.

‘It is not good enough, the situation we have in Britain today.’ No one from the Polish Embassy was available for comment last night.’
