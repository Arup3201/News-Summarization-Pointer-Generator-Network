An Australian man, who is believed to have been fighting alongside terrorist organisation the Islamic State in Syria, has been reportedly killed in the war-torn country.

The Syria 24 News Network reported that Lebanese born Ahmad Mohamad al-Ghaz'zaoui (also spelt Al-Ghazzawi) who is believed to have formerly lived in Bankstown in Sydney's west, was killed by the Syrian army as a member of ISIS on December 27,News Corp reports.

Following news of his death, dozens of people took to social media to show support and praise the alleged terrorist.

In a series of posts to his Facebook page, Sydney business manager Abo Elmineh, dubbed Al-Ghazzawi a 'martyr' and a hero'. 

Written in Arabic, his messages  asked for God to 'rest his soul in peace' and stated that Ghazzawi had 'died in the land of the pure'.

Dozens of people followed suit, writing comments such as: 'God have mercy on him' and asking for 'God to make him a martyr'.

Others, such as Hassan Ghazzawi, went as far as to call him their 'hero'. 

However many others responded to Syria 24's announcement with disgust towards the Australia, writing: 'One way ticket to hell this pig' and 'Good riddance'.

Australian officials have so far been unable to confirm news of Al-Ghazzawi's death nor whether he had fled Australia to join ISIS fighters in Syria, News Corp reports.

Earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis revealed that approximately 20 Australians were known by the government to have died in conflict in Syria and Iraq so far, the ABC reported. 

Amongst them: Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who was believed to have recruited dozens to fight overseas and was part of a plot to kill citizens in Sydney and Brisbane, 33-year-old former Brisbane City Council worker Zia Abdul Haq who died in October, Australian soldier Caner Temel who died in Syria in January and Sydney couple Yusuf Ali and who were killed in the Syrian city of Aleppo. 

News of Al-Ghazzawi's comes after revelations that Melbourne model Sharky Jama, traded in his 'budding' career for a life devoted to the Islamic State in the Middle East.

The Australian reported that Jama and friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, claim to have fled Australian for the key IS outposts of Fallujah, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, respectively.

In various pictures published by his modelling agency, Jama, of Somalian descent, is seen posing for photographs in smart casual clothing.

Jama's role in Fallujah - the first major city to fall to the Islamic State in 2014 - is not known, but is no doubt very different to his Australian occupation.  

The Federal government believes more than 70 Australians have fled to join the fighting in Iraq and Syria and the passports of more than 100 others have been cancelled.

Counter-terrorism researcher Dr Anne Aly, from Curtin University, told Daily Mail Australia the young men matched the 'typical' profile of Australians joining the Islamic State.

'That is pretty much a very typical profile, young men who for all intents and purposes seem to be quite well integrated... but then there's something that turns them'.

'It might take a year, it might take six months and if they continue down that path and become more and more radicalised they get to the point where they're ready to take action'.

While many Australians have taken up arms on behalf of the Islamic State, and several have died, others have joined the terrorist group's propaganda arm. 

Last week, it was reported that a western Sydney man has joined the organisation's media arm, which produces its slick, high-definition propaganda packages for broadcast and upload.

The man is understood to be working as a video editor. He described his life as 'pretty typical' in an interview with The Australian newspaper. 

'I have a job, I live in a HQ, eat, sleep, work, hope an airstrike gets me so I can be Shaheed (martyred),' he was quoted saying. 

Two Australian nationals have featured in Islamic State videos - the so-called 'Ginger Jihadi', Abdullah Elmir, 17 and Zakaria Raad, 22.

Elmir has not appeared in a video since October, when he was broadcast wearing military fatigues and surrounded by chanting Islamic State militants. 

Raad was reported killed shortly after his appearance in a July recruitment video with other militants.
