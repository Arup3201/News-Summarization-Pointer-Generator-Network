Alive and kicking: Faye Dunaway, 72, is as healthy as an ancient 30-year-old, scientists have said

Here's the good news – 72 is the new 30.

The bad news? It doesn’t quite mean you’ll be wrinkle-free in your eighth decade.

Scientists have found that a primitive hunter gatherer at 30 would have had the same odds of dying as a 72-year-old in a developed country does now.

And over the course of 8,000 generations of humans, the biggest drop in mortality has occurred in the past four.

Since 1840, the life expectancy of a newborn baby in a Western industrialised nation has risen by around three months each year.

Lifespans are now beyond 80 in some developed nations, thanks to improved medicine and nutrition.

The Max Planck Institute for Demographic
 Research in Rostock, Germany, say that modern healthcare and medicines are responsible for increased life expectancies.

Researchers have studied the death rates of hunter-gatherers whose way of life has not changed for generations.

They looked at tribal people in Australia, Africa, South America and the Philippines and found that at 30-years-old, these people had the same chance of dying as Japanese people aged 72.

Comparing hunter gatherers with the 
long-lived Japanese, the authors led by Dr Oskar Burger, wrote: 
‘Hunter-gatherers at age 30 have the same probability of death as 
present-day Japanese at the age of 72.'

In fact, hunter-gatherer death rates 
were closer to those of chimpanzees than to citizens of Japan or Sweden,
 the research showed.

Since about 1840, life spans in the longest-lived populations have increased by about three months per year, said the researchers.

Most of the death-rate reduction had occurred since 1900 and been experienced by only about four of the roughly 8,000 human generations that have ever lived.

Up to the age of around 15, hunter-gatherers had death rates more than 100 times higher than those seen in modern-day Japan and Sweden.

Across the whole of their life spans they had a more than 10-fold greater likelihood of dying.

Hunter-gatherer death rates and those of people in Sweden were much closer in 1900 than they are today, said the scientists.

The increase in human life expectancy had been largely achieved 'by removing environmental shocks, by making injuries and illnesses less fatal with medical technology, and by enhancing health at older ages by improving nutrition and reducing disease at younger ages'.

The findings are published in the journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences.
