Argentina and Holland will meet for the ninth time in Wednesday night's World Cup semi-final.

The South Americans have recorded just one victory over the Dutch - but it was the most important match of the lot.

The 1978 World Cup final in Buenos Aires saw Argentina emerge 3-1 victors, rendering Holland bridesmaids for the second time in four years.

Mario Kempes was the hero for the host nation, scoring twice as Argentina won after extra-time.

Kempes gave Argentina a first-half lead before a late Dick Nanninga equaliser.

And in the added 30 minutes, Kempes bundled Argentina back in front before Daniel Bertoni put the result beyond doubt.

Having lost the 1974 World Cup final 2-1 to West Germany, Holland found themselves heartbroken once again.

Johan Cruyff, the player of the tournament in 1974, had retired from international football in October 1977, but left a Dutch side still boasting such talent as Ruud Krol and Johan Neeskens.

Aside from 1978's top scorer Kempes, Argentina could count defensive linchpin and captain Daniel Passarella and striker Leopoldo Luque among their key men.

Passarella was a part of the 1986 squad that lifted Argentina's second and last World Cup.

The Dutch have still not shaken off their bridesmaids tag and they were runners-up for a third time in 2010 as Spain lifted their first World Cup.

Victory over Argentina on Wednesday night though would give them a fourth bite at the cherry.
