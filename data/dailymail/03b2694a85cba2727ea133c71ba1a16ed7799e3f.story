Zara Phillips attended Cheltenham Festival for the fourth day in a row today as she arrived at the Gloucestershire course to celebrate the last day of racing.

The Queen's granddaughter, a keen horsewoman herself, attended every single day of the National Hunt meet, and every appearance was accompanied by a stunning outfit - and topped with an eye-catching hat.

Today's offering was a design by milliner Amy Money, a wide-brimmed trilby trimmed with clutch of long pheasant feathers. The flamboyant piece perfectly set off a simple Katherine Hooker coat in a light camel wool, which had crushed velvet flourishes at the cuffs, collar and pockets.

Smart choice: Zara nailed racing style yet again in a taupe coat with velvet collars, cuffs and pockets worn with a black trilby trimmed with long pheasant feathers

Today's Philip Treacy hat was trimmed the latest in a sequence of spectacular headpieces

Zara had been in the 
saddle herself last week, as she competed on her horse Black Tuxedo at the 
Tweseldown Horse Trials, and also rode to victory on Silver Lining at 
the same event.

Zara spent the day with her mother Princess Anne and friends including Ben and Mary-Clare Elliot, and husband Mike Tindall arrived later in the day.

Famously thrifty, Princess Anne recycled a favourite coat for the occasion, a green and grey coatthat she wore for the Sandringham Christmas church service last year.

The Princess Royal is no stranger to reusing outfits she has had for many years - indeed we had seen the burnt orange coat she chose for Cheltenham two days ago at the Grand National last April.

In 2007, Princess Anne wore a dress for a wedding that she had previously worn 27 years earlier for Charles and Diana's ceremony.

Thrifty: Anne, who has said in the past she has no qualms recycling outfits she has worn before, wore a green and grey patterned coat she wore to church last Christmas day - with the same boots too

Recycling royal: Princess Anne had worn the smart patterned coat before, for the Christmas day church service at Sandringham

Lucky coat? Princess Anne wore today's burnt orange overcoat at last year's Grand National too, right

The royal two were among 50,000 fans who gathered to enjoy the first of four days of racing at Cheltenham.

Other celebrity guests at the course across the week included actor James Nesbitt, comedian Ronnie Corbett, TV presenter Dermot O’Leary and TV chatshow host Jeremy Kyle, who attended with his wife Carla.

Happy families: Entrepreneur Ben Elliot attended with wife Mary-Clare, whom he married in a ceremony attended by Charles and Camilla last year. The two were joined by Mary-Clare's father, musician Steve Winwood

Day two: Autumnal in a brown pillbox and taupe wool coat

Day three: Jazzing up a black trench with cerise Philip Treacy hat
