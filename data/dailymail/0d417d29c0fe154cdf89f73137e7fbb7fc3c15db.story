David Beckham made a name for himself with a sublime strike from inside his own half at Wimbledon and son Romeo could be set to follow in his father's footsteps, but in a different sport.  

It has been Brooklyn  attracting the limelight in the Beckham family in recent weeks with his future at Arsenal being closely monitored, but younger brother Romeo has now hit the headlines after he was tipped to become a future tennis star.

If he fulfills his potential, according to tennis coach John Johnson, the 10-year-old could be winning titles at SW19 in the future.

Johnson even revealed plans to have a chat with mum Victoria to make her aware of Romeo's talent.

'He has a lot of talent and very good hand-eye coordination,' Johnson was quoted as saying in the Daily Star.

'I'm going to have a meeting with his mother about it to reinforce that because I'm not sure his parents realise how good he is.

'Romeo really loves tennis. He is really into it and very talented. Romeo has a natural swing and is very enthusiastic, he just loves it.

'He kept telling me and I could see how focused he was.He is very energetic, very quick and strong.'
