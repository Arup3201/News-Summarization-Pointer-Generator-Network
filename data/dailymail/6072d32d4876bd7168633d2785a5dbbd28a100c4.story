A bungling underage drinker was barred from entering a pub after producing a fake ID card belonging to - Rodney Trotter of Peckham.

Door staff became suspicious when the plonker showed them a driving licence bearing the name of the Only Fools And Horses character and his address - 23 Nelson Mandela House.

It also featured a photograph of Rodney actor Nicholas Lyndhurst and date of birth 26 February 1960.

The drunken youngster turned up at the pub in Newquay on Saturday night and claimed to be 24 when the age on the Rodney ID would have made him 52.

A manager of the Newquay Arms, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was there when he turned up.

'He was a bit drunk, he handed over the ID and I looked at it and then scanned it to double check it was fake and then I noticed the picture.

'It had Rodney Trotter’s picture and I said to him "so this is you?" and he just said "yeah yeah yeah".

'Then I asked him his date of birth and he said it. Then I told him it didn’t match the one that was on the ID.

'I made the doormen UV the ID just to wind him up really and they started giggling and playing along with him.'

The fake ID - which can be bought online as a novelty item for £2.99 - was signed off with the name 'Cosmic'.

The pub manager added: 'We kept asking if it was him and what his date of birth was, we even asked his star sign before asking him about his signature, which was ‘Cosmic’.

'I haven’t ever seen a celebrity ID trying to be used before, but the worst case we have had was probably when a white man tried to use his friend's ID, who was clearly African American and said he had "been on holiday".'

The card was confiscated and police were called but the man left the scene by the time officers arrived.

Local police Inspector Ian Drummond-Smith said the fake ID could have landed him in jail.

He said: 'Lucky for him he’d left before police arrived, as possessing a forged driving licence can attract two years’ imprisonment.

'We have seized 13 forged IDs so far this season but even we saw the funny side of this one. I don’t think it would ever have worked.'

Newquay is plagued by underage drinkers and ID scanners have been brought in to tighten up door entrance policies.

Inspector Drummond-Smith said: 'So far this season we have returned 42 driving licenses or passports to the DVLA or Passport Office.

'If you lend someone your ID, the door staff will retain it and we will send it back. Passports remain the property of HM Government and if misused will always be returned.

'This caused a major problem for a woman last week who is due to fly out on holiday in three weeks’ time.

'People should never lend out their passport and I would ask them to think very hard about the consequences.'
