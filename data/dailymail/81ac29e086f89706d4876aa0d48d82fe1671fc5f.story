Suspect: Neil Prescott phoned in the threat to software and mailroom supplier Pitney Bowes near Washington, D.C.

Police have foiled what they believed could have been another Aurora-scale massacre after a man who called himself 'a joker' and had an arsenal of semi-automatic rifles threatened to shoot up the business from which he was being fired.

Neil Prescott, of Crofton, Maryland, was wearing a T-shirt that read 'Guns don't kill people. I do,' when first confronted by officers on Thursday, police revealed today.

The man, identified in a search warrant, told a supervisor at software and mailroom supplier Pitney Bowes that, 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna load my guns and blow everybody up,' and that he wanted to see the supervisor's 'brain splatter on the floor.'

The threats were made multiple times in separate phone calls this week, and investigators who searched the 28-year-old's apartment this morning found several thousand rounds of ammunition and about two dozen semi-automatic rifles and pistols.

The arsenal of weapons included one assault rifle, two shotguns, nine handguns and three rifles, according to the search warrant.

Prescott is receiving a psychiatric evaluation at a hospital and charges are still pending.

'We can't measure what was prevented 
here, but was going on over the last 36 hours was a significant incident
in the county. And we think a violent episode was avoided,' said Prince
George's County Police Chief Mark Magaw.

It was not immediately clear when the
threat was to be carried out or how seriously it was meant to be taken,
but last week's mass shooting at a Colorado theater - coupled with the 'Joker' reference - put police 
especially on edge and gave the comments extra urgency, officials said.

James Holmes had his hair dyed reddish-orange as if 
out of a comic book, and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has said
he also called himself the Joker, when he allegedly shot dead at least 12 people and wounding 38 others during a late-night screening of the new Batman movie in Aurora.

'In light of what happened a week ago in Aurora, Colorado, it's important to know, (for) the community to know, that we take all threats seriously. And if you're going to make a threat, we will take action,' Magaw said.

Threatening: Police served the search warrant Friday morning and took him into custody without a struggle, police officials said

Though there is no other indication 
of a link to the Colorado shooting, police believe the joker comments 
made by Prescott were a 'clear reference' to the killings, according to 
the warrant.

A police officer toldÂ ABC7 that they believe the foiled shooting 'could have been another Aurora.'

Neighbor Wilbert Brinson, who lives 
in a building across from Prescott's but did not know him, said he was 
alarmed by the alleged threats.

'It's an awakening, you know, after hearing what happened in Colorado,' he said.

Police would not confirm the man's identify on Friday because charges are pending. He was receiving an emergency mental health evaluation at a hospital and was taken into custody on Friday morning at his apartment in Crofton, near Annapolis, after a supervisor reported the threat.

Police checked in Thursday at Prescott's home, where he was wearing a T-shirt that said, 'Guns don't kill people. I do,' authorities said.

Dressed to kill: Neil Prescot, from Maryland, was wearing a T-shirt that read 'Guns don't kill people. I do,' similar to the one above, when first confronted by officers

Residence: Prescott's apartment in Crofton, Maryland, where the arsenal of weapons was seized today

Location: Pitney Bowes, in Prince George's County, Maryland, where Prescott used to work

Police served the search warrant Friday morning and took him into custody without a struggle, police officials said.

Prescott made the initial threat 
during a phone call on Monday, then made similar statements in a 
separate conversation about 15 minutes later, and said, 'It's kind of 
foolish of me to say this kind of things over government phone,' the 
warrant states.

Mail Online has found several postings on gun forums believed to be written by Prescott.

His most recent posting was made at 1.39am this morning, when he uploaded a picture of a gun alongside the caption: 'Check out the new Nightforce for my target pistol. j/k these are for my SCAR and possible other future purchase.'

It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.

Pitney Bowes spokeswoman Carol Wallace 
said in a statement that Prescott was an employee of a subcontractor to 
the company and had not been on any Pitney Bowes property in more than 
four months.
