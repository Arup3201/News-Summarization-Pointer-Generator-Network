Carlo Ancelotti hailed Gareth Bale as the best player in the world ahead of his homecoming in Cardiff for the Super Cup tomorrow.

The Real Madrid coach, who won the Champions League with the club last season, claimed the Wales forward is now one of the elite.

Real Madrid, who won their tenth European Cup against Atletico Madrid last season, face Europa League winners Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Although Ancelotti admitted competition was fierce for the world player of the year honour - even including some of his own Real Madrid’s stars - the Italian claimed Bale is at the pinnacle of his career.

He said: ‘As I said a lot of the time last year, he is the best. He is one of the best players in the world now, but I’m not so interested in whether Gareth can be nominated and go on to win it. 

'What is important is that Gareth is here to help the win titles.

‘But if I say Gareth deserves to win it, then I could say Ramos, or Ronaldo also deserves to win it.’ 

Meanwhile, Ancelotti says he is ready to unleash the full might of his enviable playing resources against Sevilla.

World Cup stars James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, signed from Monaco and Bayern Munich this summer, are set to feature in Ancelotti's starting line-up at Cardiff City Stadium.

'Kroos has done well in the last five days, and I think he is ready to face this match,' Ancelotti said, during his pre-match press conference in Cardiff. 'He is up to the task, and I think he will play tomorrow.

'Rodriguez is a fantastic player. He ran a lot in the World Cup, and he can help the team to be better. He will start.

'It's true we have had players who have come late to the team, with not a lot of training, but we are pleased with the state of preparation.

'Cristiano is well, he has no problem. I feel he's in good physical condition and has done everything to participate in this game. He is facing this game in good spirit.

'It's an honour for me to be the manager of Real Madrid. I have a fantastic squad, and the club has worked hard this summer to have a better squad. The squad has plenty of confidence to have a good season.'
