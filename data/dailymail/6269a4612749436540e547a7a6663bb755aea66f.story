Maribel Alpas, 31, worked for Filipino nurses Dennis and Girlie Samson for two years, caring for their two young children, in Warrington, Cheshire

Detectives want to question two UK-based nurses after their children’s nanny was found beheaded in the Philippines.

Maribel Alpas, 31, worked for Filipino nurses Dennis and Girlie Samson for two years, caring for their two young children, in Warrington, Cheshire.

During a trip home to see her family in the Philippines, the nanny went missing and on March 25, her severed head was found in a canal.

Bones and human remains were found among a pile of ashes at the Samsons’ family home in the Philippines, police said.

Detectives
 have charged Mrs Samson’s brother Elcielo Valdez – who is missing – 
with her murder and said they urgently want to speak to her UK 
employers.

Mr
 Samson has been told not to return to work at Warrington Hospital, 
where he is a nursing assistant, while the Trust sought information on 
the police investigation.

Speaking from his three-storey semi-detached townhouse, in Warrington, said: ‘We are really stressful.

‘The thing is, me and Maribel, as employer and employee we don’t have any arguments.

‘I never hit her. I never did anything bad at all.

‘It happened in the Philippines. I really had no idea.’

Miss
 Alpas, described as ‘always smiling’ and ‘family-orientated’ by her 
grieving relatives, was the breadwinner for her sister and mother, who 
lived in Hinoba-an, in Negros Occidental.

She met the Samsons in the Philippines two years ago and agreed to move to England with them to care for their children.

According to local reports, the nanny went to the Philippines for an extended holiday with the Samson family in December last year.

Mr and Mrs Samson then returned to Britain, while Miss Alpas stayed on to visit her family.

Shortly before the nanny flew back to England, Mr Samson reportedly asked her to visit his house in Nueva Ecija to pick up some documents for him.

The nanny texted her sister on March 20 to say she was going to her to Mr Samson’s home and that someone was picking her up at the bus station.

Police chiefs said that was the last time her family heard from her.

Her relatives launched an online Facebook campaign to find her but, on March 25, a farmer reportedly found her head in a bucket in an irrigation canal in Barangay San Fernando Sur, Nueva Ecija.

She was apparently identified from a passport and documents found nearby.

Chief inspector Eric de Venancio told the Mail: ‘We have charged Elcielo with murder in his absence. He is still at large.

A Facebook page was set up calling for justice for Maribel whose head was found in a canal in the Philippines

‘He was seen near the canal before the head was found.

‘We have not been able to contact Mr Samson. I am asking him to get in touch with me so I can ask him further questions.’

He added: ‘According to the victim’s relatives, Mr Samson asked Miss Alpas to go to his house to collect some documents.

‘We searched the house after the head was found and discovered some ashes in the back yard of the compound.

‘Forensic officers found these were human remains and bones. We have yet to establish if these belong to Miss Alpas.’

The Facebook page, called Justice for Maribel Alpas, reads: 'You were such a blessing to your Family and Friends. 

'You brought so much joy and laughter for over 31 years.

'You will be remembered as the Maribel we used to know and could have been.

'Your memories will always be in our Hearts...'

Yesterday, Mrs Samson, 40, expressed her shock at the woman’s brutal death, saying: ‘Maribel was very, very close to us.

‘She was a lovely person. She was a kind person.

‘I myself am really stressed with what happened to her.

‘I was here back in England. She was in the Philippines.

‘We were really, really surprised by what happened, and angry as well.’

Mrs Samson said her children were confused by their nanny’s absence, saying: ‘Our children are only young. They don’t know what’s going on.’

She added: ‘She was close to us. Ask our neighbours, ask whoever knew her.

‘She loved us, and we were the same to her. She was absolutely spoilt.

‘We treated her like a member of the family. As a family, being Filipinos.

‘We don’t even have a harsh word with her, don’t want to say anything to her, with her being here on her own in England and having no family with her.

‘She could just ask for everything. I gave to her food, clothing, like personal things, lotions.

‘I even paid for her holiday. If she asked for money to be sent to her family – we had no arguments.’

Maribel Alpas’s sister, Jocebel, who has led the Facebook campaign, said: ‘She was so family-oriented.

‘She was always smiling and was always playfully annoying her nephews and nieces.

‘She didn't want our mother to experience hardships.  Mother will not suffer anymore.

‘She reached the age of 31, but she didn't want to get married yet because still wanted to give us a better life.

‘That was all she wanted, for our family, just for us.

‘She was our breadwinner.  She sent me to college but I was not able to graduate.

‘All of her salary was given to our mother, there were almost nothing left for herself.’

Miss Alpas said that her sister intended to work for the family for two more years, despite the low wages, until she was eligible to apply for British residency and seek work elsewhere.

A spokesman for Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘The trust has not been made aware of any charges being brought against a member of our staff in relation to an incident in the Philippines and we are currently seeking information from the authorities about the case.

‘While the trust seeks information on the alleged charges the staff member will not be on duty.’
