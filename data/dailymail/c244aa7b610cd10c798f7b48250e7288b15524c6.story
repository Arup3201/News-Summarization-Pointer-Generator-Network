A Government-backed scheme offered young people career advice on how to earn up to £48,000 a year working in the sex industry, it was revealed today.

Tips offered by the Business Wales website - backed by the Welsh Government - included how to become a stripper as well as running a lap dancing club and escort agency.

They were among hundreds of ‘start up business ideas’ and said that strippers and lap dancers could ‘expect to earn an average £232 per evening’, with annual incomes ‘from £24,000 to £48,000’.

Users interested in setting up an 
escort agency were advised that ‘the escorts provide companionship to 
the client when attending events such as a formal dinner or the 
theatre’.

It said clients typically include single businessmen and women who hire an escort to ‘accompany’ them to events and holidays.

‘Escort
agencies usually have several escorts on their books,’ the factsheet 
said. ‘Agencies charge escorts an ‘introduction fee’ of between 25% and 
55% of what the client pays to the escort’.

While
it went on to say that it was an offence for an agency to ‘incite escorts 
to act as prostitutes’ the guide provided links to websites offering 
‘transsexual post-operation and submissive escorts’.

'Stripping
is degrading for women and the Welsh Government should not the 
promoting the view that sexually exploitative work is an acceptable 
career'

Jocelyn Davies, Plaid Cymru AM

Plaid Cymru AM Jocelyn Davies said: 
‘I’m certainly not a prude, but it is hard to understand how the Welsh 
Government can believe it is acceptable to provide information to help 
women become strippers or run a lap dancing club, which is classed as a 
sex establishment.

‘While 
jobs are difficult to find and money is tight, should the Welsh 
Government be effectively facilitating these activities by putting 
information on their website?

‘Stripping
is degrading for women and the Welsh Government should not the 
promoting the view that sexually exploitative work is an acceptable 
career.’

Her remarks were echoed by Lib Dem Eluned Parrott and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies.

No longer there: After the issue was raised in the Senedd, the sections about stripping, lap dancing and escort agencies were removed from the site

Miss Parrott said: ‘These are perfectly legitimate businesses - however I was very surprised to learn that these factsheets are offered to young people via a link on the Welsh Government’s Big Ideas Wales website, which is aimed specifically at youth entrepreneurs.

'The adult entertainment industry is a field that is appropriate for adults, but not one that should be marketed as an aspirational career opportunity to potentially vulnerable young people'

Eluned Parrott, Lib Dem AM

‘The adult entertainment industry is just that - a field that is appropriate for adults, but not one that should be marketed as an aspirational career opportunity to potentially vulnerable young people.’

And Mr Davies added: ‘While we should all be free to choose our own career paths, the Government has a duty to put safeguards in place protecting the most vulnerable.’

After the issue was raised in the Senedd, the sections about stripping, lap dancing and escort agencies were removed from the site.

Wales First Minister and father-of-two Carwyn Jones told AMs he had had just been informed of the website ‘10 minutes ago’ but promised his officials would be investigating the matter.

ON STRIPPERS

Strippers and lap dancers can expect to be paid an average of £232 per evening and earn between £24,000 and £48,000, according to the Welsh Government-backed guide.

'Some strippers will remain in underwear but others may become completely naked'

Male or female strippers, it says, perform choreographed dance routines while removing items of clothing - ‘some strippers will remain in underwear but others may become completely naked’.

Aspiring actors, models and artists may use stripping as a source of extra income while they try to establish themselves in the entertainment industry, the factsheet advises. Tips include training in dance, kiss-o-grams or pole-dancing.ON ESCORTS

Clients typically pay between £120 and £150 per hour for ‘an escort's time and company’, it advises. Single businessmen and women typically hire an escort to accompany them to dinner or the theatre.

'Any sexual activity between a client and escort is outside of the agreed escort service'

Agencies charge escorts an introduction fee of between 25 per cent and 55 per cent, with some agencies flying escorts overseas to meet clients.

‘While it is legal for agencies to provide escorts for companionship and conversation only, it is an offence for an agency to cause or incite their escorts to act as prostitutes,’ it adds.

‘Any sexual activity between a client and escort is outside of the agreed escort service, a private matter and not connected with the agency.’ON LAP DANCES

Fancy running your own lap dancing club? There is a factsheet for that too.

'The majority of customers at lap dancing clubs will be male and venues are particularly popular with stag parties'

Club owners will first need a sex establishment licence from their local council. Local residents can object to lap dancing venues if they feel they are in an inappropriate area.

‘Dancers usually work on a self-employed basis and pay the club a fee to use its premises. A club will need to recruit suitable dancers for its customers and can use a dancer recruitment agency to do so,’ it adds.

‘The majority of customers at lap dancing clubs will be male and venues are particularly popular with stag parties. Groups may wish to hire areas of the club to host private parties.’

ON SEX SHOPS

Sales of adult toys and lingerie were reported to have surged during the recession, with UK consumers now spending £315million a year in sex shops, according to the advice.

Emerging trends include new luxury sex 
toys that target a high-end, largely female market and have become more 
commonplace thanks to changing attitudes.

'These luxury toys can cost anything from £100 upwards and sales have been strong despite the recession'

‘These luxury toys can cost anything from £100 upwards and sales have been strong despite the recession,’ it says.

Budding erotic boutique owners will need to get a sex establishment licence from their local council, depending on what they sell.

A typical budget for fixtures and fittings comprises of mannequins for displaying lingerie (£80 each), wall display units (£60 for 10), changing cubicles (£162) and full-length mirrors (£150).

Refunds on items, including underwear, latex clothing and sex toys that have been worn or used do not have to be given on grounds of hygiene, it adds.
