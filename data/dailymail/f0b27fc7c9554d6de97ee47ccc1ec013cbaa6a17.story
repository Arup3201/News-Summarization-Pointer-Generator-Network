Most dogs are happy with an extra pig’s ear or a new chew toy for Christmas, however, some owners like to treat their pets to excess.

Fortunately for owners who like to play dress up with their dachshunds, there are designers who specialise in outfits for dogs.

‘Animal couturier’ Anthony Rubio creates crystal encrusted dresses, sequenced jackets and miniature hats which sells all around the world.

Mr Rubio has spent the past ten years filling owners’ closets with the most fashionable outfits for their four-legged friends.

The 45-year-old designer has created hundreds of outfits made of the satins, taffeta and boucle fabrics, which can cost more than $1,000.

Mr Rubio’s mannequins are his two Chihuahuas, Bogie and Kimba.

He said: ‘The clothing is just like an extension to prove that they're like family. If I would dress a child, I'd do the same thing with my dogs.

‘I'm very particular about how we appear in public, I think they are too. It's a big no-no for them to ever go outside unless I do the once over on them.’

Rubio started creating dog clothes when he rescued a mistreated dog that needed something warm to wear.

He said: ‘It kind of encouraged me to start experimenting further and developing more fashions.’

It takes the designer two days to a few weeks to create complete outfits, depending on the size of the dog.

Rubio consults with his clients and their dogs before creating clothes for them. Most clients want outfits for their pets for holidays, parties, and other special events.

He said: ‘I find out if the pet is comfortable wearing clothing first, I don't want to force anything on an animal.’

Grace Forster, one of Anthony's clients said: ‘We love working with Anthony, he's so creative. He has all these great ideas of what he'd like to do for every occasion.’

Like owner, like dog: They say dogs and owners sometimes look alike - in this case, at least they're both rocking the blue steel and Mohawk
