You might want to take a seat - or maybe not: new research suggests your chair is killing you.

That's the finding of Dr James Levine, director of obesity solutions at America's Mayo Clinic, who says: 'The consequences of prolonged sitting include obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and poor mood.'

This is because of the effect sitting has on your body. It means the rate at which you burn calories falls to about one per minute (just above what it would be were you dead), and the amount of enzymes responsible for removing bad fats from the bloodstream plunges.

Could you walk your way to better health while fielding phone calls, answering emails and planning proposals on a laptop?

Worse, the long-term harm of these effects cannot be mitigated by exercise. One piece of research found women who spent six hours or more a day sitting had a 40 per cent higher rate of premature death than those who sat for three hours. In men it was 20 per cent.

However, a bonkers-sounding new invention could be the answer. Treadmill desks, which allow you to work while walking, have taken health-conscious New York and Los Angeles by storm, and are now available in the UK.

The desks - which come with an inbuilt workstation and slow belt on which you walk at about two miles an hour while using your computer - are already being used by Google, Microsoft and the hotel chains Hyatt and Marriott.

The average person will burn about 100 calories for every mile they walk. It takes a bit of getting used to, but some workers claim they've lost weight, cured back pain and tackled depression.
