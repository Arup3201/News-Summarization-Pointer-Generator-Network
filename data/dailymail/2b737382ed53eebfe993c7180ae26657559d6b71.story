The mother of a four-year-old boy who locked her son inside a dog case has been sentenced.

Suzanne Satterfield, 34, of Chelsea, Oklahoma, was sentenced to 22 years behind bars. She pleaded guilty in May to child abuse by injury and child neglect.

A district judge in Claremore handed down Satterfield's punishment on Thursday.

Court documents say Satterfield's son was held in a dog cage last year for an estimated 14 hours each day.

Her co-defendant and common-law husband, 32-year-old Jonathon Wade Lee, was sentenced last month to 27 years in prison for child abuse and sexually abusing another child.

That victim was abused over a two-month period and is one of Satterfield's four children, whom the couple lived with, The Claremore Progress reported.

The man told authorities that they kept the boy in the cage for discipline and protection.

Lee padlocked the boy's room, according to The Progress.

The boy's condition was revealed by a social worker last October, TulsaWorld.com said.

An affidavit obtained by the news site claims Satterfield said the dog cage 'was a big mistake, and they went too far.'

District Attorney Reagan Reininger told Newson6, 'It's really shocking to have a child put in a dog cage the length of time he was in a dog cage for, and that's what people get shocked about.'

Satterfield's children are now in protective custody, the affiliate station said.
