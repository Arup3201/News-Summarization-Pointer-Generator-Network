Move over Bill Gates, there’s a new whizz kid in town and he really is a kid.

Gates may have been the world's youngest self-made billionaire but Shafay Thobani, 8, could be his up and coming rival after becoming the world’s youngest Microsoft specialist.

The boy from Pakistan has mastered complicated internet protocol and domain name systems to become a Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) in Microsoft Windows 7 Configuration and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2.

Whizz kid: Shafay Thobani, 8, has become the world's youngest Microsoft specialist, doing 13 months of training and classes to get the Microsoft certification

Instead of playing video games or ball sports, Shafay spent 13 months studying to pass IT and software tests, scoring 91 per cent to get the certification.

The rigorous learning meant he spent afternoons after school in a 1,000 sq ft training area for five hours of structured computer classes.

Taking up technology young: Even at three-years-old Shafay found technology more interesting than his own toys

Dr Shau Thobani, his father and CEO of Thobson Technologies introduced Shafay to the world of technology from a young age.

He said: ‘When he was three years old he was more interested by my electronics than he was in his own toys.

‘Even when he was small, I saw something different in Shafay.

‘I saw a spark in his personality.

‘Because of the nature of my work, Shafay has been born into the world of IT and technology and that is where I think he interest in computers stems from.

‘He's so intelligent. He does complicated maths on his hands instead of a calculator.

‘I feel like the luckiest parent because at the end of each day I only ever receive very positive feedback from Shafay's teachers.

‘Every year I give Shafay a new challenge to try and encourage him.

Dr Thobani said Shafay can do whatever he wants with his career.

He said: ‘I'm not forcing Shafay to do anything in his future. He will decide what he wants to do himself.

‘This view is quite unusual in our country because in Pakistan, a child's parents often force them into a specific career.’

Microsoft master: Bill Gates, the co founder of Microsoft, also showed a keen interest in computers and technology from a young age

Microsoft spokesperson Thomas Jensen said becoming certified shows a recognised level of understanding.

He said: ‘Microsoft does not keep track of the ages of the people who take the certification.

'I'm not aware of anyone younger than Shafay however I can't officially confirm this.

‘Becoming certified does not lead to employment within Microsoft and those who are certified are not paid but becoming a Certified Technology Specialist proves that you've gone through the certification process and have a certain and recognised level of understanding.’

There are specific certifications for various Microsoft products and they are designed to validate a person’s skills on the features and functionality of the software.

The Microsoft website says: ‘Designed to be relevant in today's rapidly changing IT marketplace, Microsoft Certifications help you utilise evolving technologies, fine-tune your troubleshooting skills, and improve your job satisfaction’.
