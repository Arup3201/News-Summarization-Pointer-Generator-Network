'The whole reason I got braces was 
because Niall [Horan] got braces,' says Natasha. 'I didn't really need 
braces but I wanted them because they look good and because Niall had 
them.'

Natasha, a sweet-faced girl of 17 from London, is a 'Directioner', which means like millions of other teenagers, she lives and breathes boyband One Direction.

But while teenage fandom is nothing new, the Directioners' love for  Zayn Malik, 20, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Niall Horan, all 19, and Louis Tomlinson, 21, goes beyond anything previously seen.

Thanks to Twitter, One Direction superfans know what Harry ate for breakfast, where Zayn bought his shoes, or where Niall's sleeping on any given night - and they aren't afraid to show it.

And as British GQ discovered when it straplined a Harry Styles cover with the words He's Up All Night To Get Lucky, they aren't above sending eye-opening abuse to anyone who they believe has traduced their idols.

'GO PUNCH THOSE SL*** AT GQ AND ALL THEIR BS ABOUT YOU ALL UNACCEPTABLE HARRY THEY TALK S*** ABOUT Y'ALL,' read one.

Another Directioner tweeted: 'I'll f*** you up GQ, I swear you've messed with the wrong people'.

So who are these extreme fans and what makes them go to such lengths to defend - and be noticed by - their idols?

Those are just some of the questions director Daisy Asquith attempts to answer in new Channel 4 documentary, Crazy About One Direction.

Among them is Natasha, a pretty girl with long dark hair who spends her spare time getting misty-eyed about Zayn Malik - and the rest caring for a disabled mother and younger brother.

It's hard not to warm to Natasha and harder still not to feel a pang of sympathy when she says: 'I would do literally anything to be with
Zayn. They're like my identity so I'll love them forever.

'When you feel
shy and you feel scared and that, when you divert your mind to One 
Direction, you just feel happy inside.'

Not so lucky: GQ's Twitter account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its One Direction cover

You sympathise again when she waits for hours outside a press conference only for the band to zoom past with barely a wave to acknowledge her.

Heartbreakingly, it's probably the closest she'll ever come to them. For Natasha, finding £40 or more for a concert ticket is an impossible dream.

At the same time though, you're left with a sneaking sympathy for the boys themselves, who despite the millions in the bank and the adulation, deal with daily intrusion on a massive scale.

One scene shows 19-year-old Becky from Manchester giggling as she runs through a hotel in search of the band.

'Zayn! Zayn just ran away from me,' she giggles tearfully into her iPhone moments later. In the end, Becky and her friends do get to meet the band, albeit after waiting all night.

But while Becky's activities are 
pretty harmless, if pretty irksome for the band members themselves, others take 
their love for the band to bizarre and even sinister levels.

'I'd
rather not be best friends with them 
because of all the girls who would tell you to die and I wouldn't like 
that,' says Becky in a later scene, referring to the abuse directed at anyone suspected of harbouring a romantic attachment 
to any of the boys.

Bizarre: Speculation on Harry and Louis' relationship - or lack thereof - is accompanied by fan art such as this

Cara Delevingne, Caroline Flack and Taylor Swift are just some of the women who've endured a barrage of ire from Directioners - to the point, in Swift's case, they left Twitter altogether.

Then, there's the popular Directioner pastime of 'shipping Larry' - speculating about the 'bromance, romance or just a nice friendship' between band members Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson.

Dubbed 'Larry Stylinson' by fans, conjecture about the boys' relationship - or lack thereof - is accompanied by toe-curling fan fiction and carefully drawn images detailing the 'proposal' and the twosome curled with a baby between them.

But not everyone is a fan of 'shipping Larry', it seems. 'It makes me mad because it's upsetting the boys,' says one Directioner.

Becky adds: 'Some fans want them to be gay so they can't have a girlfriend.'

Ultimately, being a Directioner is largely harmless and often fun, and allows fans the comforting sense of being part of something, of belonging, as Natasha so clearly feels.

'When you have all these other girls who
love One Direction, are mentally married to them, you feel part of this
gang,' she says.

'I'm part of being a Directioner... It's like a cult or a sect or 
something.'

A religion with Harry Styles at its heart? Taylor Swift ('I want to kill her for what she did to Harry,' says one girl) is probably quaking in her cowboy boots at the thought.
