Urban foxes can be fed, a TV wildlife expert said last night.

The advice from Autumnwatch presenter Chris Packham appears to fly in the face of claims that feeding the predators makes them more of a nuisance.

He also claimed that reports about foxes attacking humans, going up the stairs in houses and allowing themselves to be picked up were highly unlikely.

Claims: TV wildlife expert Chris Packham has said that urban foxes can be fed

Speaking ahead of the new BBC series of Autumnwatch, he warned against ‘demonising’ the animals, pointing out that urban foxes were responsible for far fewer attacks than domestic dogs.

The 52-year-old said stories about foxes were often exaggerated due to a lack of understanding, and he warned against creating a fear of foxes.

He added: ‘Reports have previously suggested foxes would do things that would be very alien.

‘For example going upstairs, allowing people to pick them up and throw them into the garden. That seems improbable to me.’

There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK, and Mr Packham said it was easy for people to live alongside them and watch them from their homes.

But he warned against feeding them too often – saying they should only be fed every now and again.

He added: ‘A lot of people like to feed foxes in their back gardens, to see one of the world’s most beautiful animals from their home.

'It’s about feeding them sporadically, not regularly, which can create dependence.

‘There are ways we can simply and positively treat these animals.

'We will look at how we can live more harmoniously with them, which can only come from better understanding of their habits.’

Mr Packham will follow the  lives of two urban fox families in Autumnwatch, which starts on October 29 on BBC2, working with the University of Brighton to show how they can coexist with humans.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said he wanted to discourage people from feeding foxes by hand or every day as they would start to associate humans with food.

Last year he said the reason why there were so many foxes was because humans in the West threw away so much food while half the world went hungry.

He added: ‘And the reason there are so many?

‘Because while half the world sleeps hungry, we waste enough food to feed them all.

‘Foxes brilliantly betray a national shame, that we’re  wasters and I don’t suppose we like that.’
