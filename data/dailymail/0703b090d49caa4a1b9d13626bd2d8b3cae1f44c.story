Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world'

Sixties screen goddess Gina Lollobrigida is squaring up for a fresh battle over her vast fortune - this time with her son.

Only son and heir Milko Skofic Jr wants to wrest control of her estate from the actress, 86, amid fears that she is in the grip of several young male admirers.

A year ago, the Italian actress, once dubbed 'The world’s most beautiful woman', was forced to take legal action against her ex-toyboy lover, whom she accused of marrying her by proxy, to get his hands on her riches.

The screen siren owns a series of properties in Italy and in Monte Carlo and has an estimated £30million fortune. Her jewels alone were worth a great deal - she auctioned them off for charity last year and they fetched £3.2million.

Mr Skofic reportedly wants the estate to be managed by a court-appointed administrator who would oversee the investments and purchases of the star and who acted with Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Sean Connery in her heyday.

Mr Skofic, the son of a Yugoslav doctor whom Miss Lollobrigida divorced in 1971, told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero: ‘My mother needs an administrator - I fear she may no longer be capable of handling her affairs by herself.’

The lifestyle of his mother recently seen in the company of a 'very young manager,' had given Mr Skofic reason for concern, the newspaper reported.

A court will rule on the request for an administrator in April.

Miss Lollobrigida opposes the move saying she is ‘perfectly capable in myself’. She told the newspaper: ‘I am still travelling non-stop, all over the world. I flit back and forth to Monte Carlo all the time'.

The screen diva, known for her rivalry with fellow Italian Sophia Loren, made headlines the world over last year when she claimed that her former boyfriend paid an impersonator to stand in for her at a proxy wedding in Spain in 2010.

Miss Lollobrigida first met Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, 43 years her junior, at a party in Monte Carlo in the 1980s. The couple became companions and planned to marry in 2006 but Miss Lollobrigida changed her mind before the ceremony could take place.

The former sex symbol said she had no knowledge of her 2010 wedding to Mr Rafols and would never have agreed to it. She only discovered it by chance on the internet with the help of her young male manager, Andrea Piazzolla.

She told the Daily Mail last year: 'I knew nothing about this until I did some research on the internet. He invented a false document to carry out this wedding and now he will pay. I will not rest until he has been brought to justice. He is nothing but a vulture, circling me, sniffing my blood. He married me and was waiting for me to die so he could inherit my possessions.'

But Rafols claimed the marriage was ‘completely legitimate,’ and witnessed by eight people.

Miss Lollobrigida's agent, Paola Comin, told the Daily Mail that the actress was abroad and unavailable for comment.

She added: 'She is certainly mentally present and has no need of a court appointed administrator.'

Sour: The pair were engaged in 2006, but Rigau backed out at the last minute declaring he could not handle the media spotlight
