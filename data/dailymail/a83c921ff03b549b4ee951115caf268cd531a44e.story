Thousands of NHS patients could
be secretly monitored by the Government for symptoms of the human form of mad
cow disease amid concerns that there could be another wave of infections.

Experts advising the Department
of Health believe patients who have received more than 80 blood transfusions
are most at risk of developing the fatal brain disease because it can be passed
on through infected blood.

They say monitoring these
patients could give vital clues about the way the disease develops and is
transmitted from person to person and could help work out whether there are
likely to be further deaths.

It could also inform officials whether the risk
from blood donations needs to be treated more seriously.

But they are considering
conducting their surveillance secretly because they fear that informing
patients they are at risk and are being monitored will cause unnecessary alarm.

The proposals have been
discussed by a powerful panel of leading scientists and doctors, which advises
the Government on the disease, known as variant CJD.

The panel's report, published
online, suggests conducting 'covert health surveillance' of around 30,000
patients known to have received a high number of blood transfusions.

Experts would expect to see at
least 150 cases of vCJD in this group of patients, based on scientific evidence
that between one in 4,000 and one in 20,000 of the population may be infected.

But this has so far not been
seen and may either mean the risk is lower than previously thought, or that it
is taking longer for cases to develop.

The 'highly transfused' group
includes people suffering life-threatening illnesses including acute leukaemia,
aplastic anaemia and the blood disorder thalassemia - as well as those with
multiple injuries due to road accidents, or heavy blood loss from aneurysms.

The report acknowledges that
following patients without their consent is 'ethically problematic'.

But the panel, a subcommittee
of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, has asked the Health
Protection Agency to set out the various options for monitoring these patients
based on seeking their consent or not.

Chris James, chief executive of
the Haemophilia Society, said: 'We are shocked to learn there was ever any
suggestion of non-consensual monitoring.

'Given the history of contaminated
blood in the 1970s and 1980s, the maintenance of medical ethics is especially
important to the haemophilia community.

'Any proposed framework must be
reviewed by an ethics committee and open to challenge from individuals and
organisations such as ourselves through a formal consultation process.'

Latest official figures show
seven NHS patients have died from vCJD after having blood transfusions.

Four are known to have been
given blood from people who were infected with fatal vCJD, and the other three
had previously had transfusions although it is not known whether the blood was
contaminated.  

Since the first vCJD cases
emerged in the mid-1990s, 175 people in Britain have died from the brain
wasting disease, which is linked to eating beef infected with BSE.

Experts predicted that hundreds
more could die after receiving blood infected with the disease. But they now
admit they are baffled as to why these cases have failed to emerge.

One theory is that some people
have a genetic advantage and may only carry the disease without developing
symptoms. However, they can still infect others if they give blood.

In one case, a patient is known
to have been exposed to vCJD in a blood transfusion and is still alive 24 years
later.

At the moment, patients are
only informed that they are at increased risk of developing vCJD if they have
been exposed to blood from more than 80 donors and if they are about to have
brain, spinal or complex eye surgery.

But this threshold may now be
raised to only inform patients if they are exposed to 300 or more blood donors
because the lack of vCJD cases so far may indicate that the risk of catching
vCJD in blood may be lower than previously suspected.

Judy Kenny, of the CJD Support
Network, whose husband Deryck died aged 69 in 2003 after being given contaminated
blood, said: 'If the authorities are going to do any monitoring, patients should
be aware of it.

'There is no grey area - if they are thinking about unconsented
monitoring, then it is wrong.'

CJD occurs when nerve-tissue proteins called prions (illustration above) turn 'bad' and gradually destroy the brain

Professor Chris Bunce, science
director of charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research, said: 'The extent of the
risk [of vCJD] to patients who receive regular blood transfusions as part of
their treatment is as yet uncertain.

'One way to ascertain the risk would
be to monitor the distribution of the pathogen among people in this group.

'But
with that comes the moral question of whether patients should be informed or
not, and this is the dilemma of the Health Protection Agency.'

A Department of Health spokesman
said: 'No decisions have been taken on any unconsented follow-up of highly
transfused patients.

'No unconsented follow-up has taken place and none would
without appropriate ethical approval and on the basis of legal advice.'
