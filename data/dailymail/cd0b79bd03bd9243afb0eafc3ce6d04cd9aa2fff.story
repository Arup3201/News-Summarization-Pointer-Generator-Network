Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring goals and winning the hearts of Spurs supporters with his all-action displays.

The 21-year-old netted twice in his side's 5-3 victory against Chelsea on New Year's Day but, as Chris Deeley of 90min.com tells us, it's not just his goals which have endeared Kane to the White Hart Lane faithful.

5.50pm, Thursday January 1. Chelsea lead Spurs 1-0, the natural order of things is in place and Harry Kane is about to be shut out by another top-class defence.

7.30pm, same day. Spurs have beaten Chelsea 5-3, Kane has scored twice, bagged an assist and been fouled for a penalty. He's a Spurs legend.

That might sound a little harsh on the 21-year-old, since he's been making fans around White Hart Lane sit up and take notice all season,  but it's only been in the last month or two that he's got his league chances. And boy, has he taken them.

I was having a conversation with another Spurs fan last season, when Kane was being started ahead of Adebayor and Soldado by Tim Sherwood, and we both came to the same conclusion - Kane would be one of the most popular players at the club, if only he was actually worth his place in the side.

Kane-aldo, as he must now surely be known, is the perfect 'club man'. He's a local boy, growing up only a few miles from the ground and a story about him shirking training would be more shocking than 10,000 volts straight to the eyeballs. His heart and soul are in the team, but he always lacked an edge.

It's fair to say that, as 2014 came to a close, he found his edge.

It's not just the sudden explosion of raw talent and terrifying bursts forward that have thrust him into the limelight - only one man covered more distance than Kane's 11.35km at White Hart Lane on Thursday.

If Kane was like another excellent Spurs striker of recent years, Dimitar Berbatov, this would be a different situation. Berbatov was easy to like, sure. Easy to admire, too. But his lazy style and aloofness tended to keep him one step removed from the fans. 

Kane's constant running and tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, though, changes things. Suddenly, he's one of us. When his form drops off - and it will, nobody can keep this scoring rate up forever - it won't be through lack of interest or effort.

It's the same reason that another man in the news this week has become a legend at his club. Sometimes Steven Gerrard plays badly, but it's never because he doesn't care. That's comforting for fans. That's the kind of dedication that inspires love from fans towards players.

I don't love Harry Kane for his goals. The goals are just a by-product of the reason that I and so many other Spurs fans love him. We love him for his heart. And we love him because when he's out on the pitch, he's showing us how much he loves us back.
