Fierce blaze: The fire which engulfed the Taufa family home at Slacks Creek, 25km south of Brisbane in August, 2011, was well alight when police and firefighters arrived after midnight. It tore quickly through the home, claiming the lives of 11 family members aged between three and 57 years old

Mr Taufa, 65, his brother-in-law, Jeremiah Lale, 36, and son-in-law, Misi Matauaina, 26, were the only three of the 14 people staying the night in the house to walk out alive.

The flames were so intense it took several weeks to identify the dead. They were Mr Taufa's wife, Fusi, 57, his daughter and Mr Matauaina's wife, Annamaria, 23, and their children, Kahlani, three, and La'Haina Matauaina, seven, Fusi's sister and the wife of Jeremiah Lale, Neti-Teukisia Lale, her children, Jerry, 18, Paul, 17, and Richie, eight, and daughters Lafoa'i, 14, and Sela, 10, and another of Mr Taufa's granddaughters, Ardelle Lee, 16, who was staying the night.

The inquest heard there was nothing to suggest the fire was suspicious, but the speed with which it took hold was a major factor in the high number of deaths.

In his evidence to the Brisbane Coroner's Court yesterday, Mr Taufa said a fire alarm had been turned off at his home many years earlier because it was too noisy.

Mr Taufa estimated that the property's smoke alarm in the ceiling of a hallway had gone off in the 1990s, but was then deactivated 'to get rid of the noise'.

Ardelle Taufa, 16, (pictured, above, left and right) had the misfortune to be visiting the Taufa family home when the blaze ripped through the house. Her mother had been out working.

Mr Taufa told the inquest that his family's sleeping arrangements at their home had changed when a second family, the Lales, moved in to the suburban home in the month before the fire, making a house of 14.

The inquest is examining the cause of the tragedy, and at the same time considering whether all properties up for sale should have smoke alarms fitted.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Simon Hamlyn-Harris, asked Mr Taufa if he could remember anyone turning the device back on.

'Not at all sir, I don't remember that anybody (turned it on again),' Mr Taufa said. He was unsure who had deactivated it, saying 'even I don't remember who (was) the person that turned it off.'

Detective Sergeant Michael Egart told the inquest how when police had arrived at the home at 12:10am, six minutes after the first triple zero call, it was well alight.

He said there was no hope of rescuing anyone at that stage because the flames had taken hold of the building; it was believed the fire started in the downstairs part of the house.

'It was utilised as an office by Mr Taufa,' Sergeant Egart said. 'It was quite congested with paperwork. It had various items of furniture as well.'

Mr Taufa told the inquest he was working in his study on the night the fire erupted and that his desk had been covered in papers, by a desk lamp and glass ashtray.

Mr Taufa recalled having a cigarette earlier in the nigh, and that his daughter, Annamaria had come downstairs and kissed him goodnight.

'She said "Dad, I'm going to bed", and I said "ok, see you tomorrow".'

Mr Taufa would nt see his daughter alive again.

Mr Taufa said his wife was sleeping in the lounge room with two of his grandchildren when he went upstairs to have a bath.

He told the court he smelt smoke and noticed a "mist" seeping through the kitchen floorboards.

He raced downstairs and grabbed a garden hose and saw a red glow coming from his study.

'I'm thinking of killing the fire, stopping the fire,' he said.

Frantically calling out to his family, Mr Taufa two other members of the household were crying and calling out as the flames took hold.

The inquest, before Coroner James McDougall, continues.
