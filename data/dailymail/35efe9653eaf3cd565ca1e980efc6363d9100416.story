Villagers were plagued by rats after they broke free from an overcrowded cage to escape horrific neglect by their owner - who was reportedly breeding them as snake food.

Andrew Hughes, 24, of of Hallglen, Falkirk, Scotland, kept almost 200 rodents in the cruelly 
cramped conditions of a wooden rabbit hutch that only had enough space 
for 32 of the creatures. Most of the animals were pregnant females.

The Scottish SPCA was called in when residents of the village of Standburn reported rats swarming around their back doors in October.

Sickening: The rats were forced to endure horrendous conditions by owner Andrew Hughes. when they escaped they swarmed through the village of standburn in Scotland

They were then able to trace the source of the animals. It is believed the rats had chewed through  the cage and made their escape.

Hughes pleaded guilty to being responsible for 220 domestic rats and failing to provide them with a suitable environment and accommodation, keeping them in a wooden shed which had little light or ventilation.

The cage, which was not rat proof to prevent them from escaping, was contaminated by faeces and the rats were forced to swarm all over each other, leading to disease.

Hughes used 16 small boxes to keep 50 female rats and their young in overcrowded conditions.

He failed to separate the pregnant and weaning female rats from other rats prior to giving birth, so some of the young were consumed by other rats and their mothers.

He also failed to prevent uncontrolled breeding and inbreeding.

Animal welfare officials today slammed a court for not banning Hughes from keeping animals of any kind  for life.

A Scottish SPCA officer said: 'This was a
 horrific case of animal neglect. The hutch was swarming with rats and 
they were piled up on top of each other due to lack of space.

'It was clear the conditions were woefully inadequate and completely inhumane.'

The rats were left to inbreed and newly-born rats were often consumed shortly after birth because females were not separated

Scottish SPCA inspector Leanne McPake said: 'Hughes was keeping 170 rats in a two storey rabbit hutch which was approximately two foot by four foot in size.

'Of the 170 rats, 140 were females and many of them were pregnant. A further 50 mothers and their young were also found in smaller boxes, bringing the total number to 220.

'In times of stress mother rats will harm or destroy their babies and we could see young being eaten by their mothers and other rats.'

It is believed that the rats may have been bred for sale to owners of snakes. The court was told Hughes had 'no interest in animals'.

Sheriff William Gallacher replied: 'That much is evident.'

He was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months.

Hughes refused to comment after the case.
