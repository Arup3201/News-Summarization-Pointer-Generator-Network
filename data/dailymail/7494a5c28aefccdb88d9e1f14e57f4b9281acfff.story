David Cameron today promised the families of Britons killed in the Malaysian Airlines atrocity he will do ‘everything we can’ to bring their loved ones home.

The Prime Minister today met relatives of some of the 10 UK nationals among the 298 passengers and crew killed when flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.

Barry Sweeney, whose son Liam was among those killed, said after the meeting: 'I feel very angry and frustrated. It would be nice if they could just stop fighting for a little bit so that we could get all our boys and girls home.'

Mr Sweeney, whose son Liam was among 10 Britons killed in the atrocity, said he was meeting the Prime Minister 'under not very nice circumstances'

Downing Street said David Cameron wanted to 'establish if there are more things that we should be looking at and doing'

The process of retrieving the remains of all of those killed has been hampered by masked and armed pro-separatist militiamen, backed by Russia.

Speaking ahead of the meeting today, Mr Cameron told Sky News: ‘I am sure that the first concern of the bereaved families is that their loved ones are treated with respect and dignity.

‘We must do everything we can to make that crash site is properly managed; that their loved ones are brought home and that everything that can be done on that front is being done.’

He held talks with the families in Number 10 as the European Union agreed a fresh round of sanctions to tighten the economic stranglehold on Russia.

The new measures will include an arms embargo, a ban on the sale of dual use and sensitive technologies, and a ban on the sale of bonds and equities by state-owned Russian banks in European capital markets. 

Eight more officials - including four members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle - are also expected to be subjected to asset bans and travel freezes. The White House indicated that additional US sanctions can be expected to follow the EU announcement.

Mr Cameron added: ‘The sanctions relate to Vladimir Putin and Russia’s behaviour. 

'We want to make it absolutely clear that Russia’s behaviour in destabilising another country is unacceptable and therefore the EU with the US will be imposing further sanctions unless that behaviour changes.

‘We are united in sending that tough message, and it is a message that will be backed by tough action.’

Mr Cameron said he wanted to ensure the bodies of those killed were 'treated with respect and dignity'

As the families' representatives met in Number 10, the EU agreed a new package of tough sanctions to tighten the stranglehold on Russia

In addition to the 10 Britons, there were 193 Dutch and 43 Malaysian people on MH17 when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on 17 July en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board.

So far 227 coffins containing an unknown number of victims have been taken from the site for identification in Hilversum, near Amsterdam. One person, a Dutch citizen, has been formally identified.

Among the Britons killed were John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were ardent Newcastle United fans killed on their way to a pre-season tour of New Zealand.

The Prime Minister, who visited an immigration raid in Slough today, said Britain would continue to step up pressure on Russia through sanctions to ensure investigators get full access to the crash site

After the meeting, his mother Angela Sweeney said she was strugglling to cope with the lack of information coming from the investigation.

She said: 'Just functioning really. Just waiting and my liaison officers have been very, very nice. It's just the waiting is the worst bit.'

The couple were among seven of the 10 families of British victims on the downed flight who attended an hour long meeting with Mr Cameron.

Mr Sweeney, 52, from Killingworth, North Tyneside, said the relatives had 'probably not' been told anything they did not already know but told how the families asked the Prime Minister for help.

He said: 'I've got to say Mr Cameron was very humble. He answered every question that was asked of him. He brought a few experts in to talk about crash sites and how the airplane might have come down.'

'We basically asked Mr Cameron just to help. The talking I suppose has got to stop and the doing has got to be done.'

He said the family did not know if their son's body remained at the crash site or if it had been taken to the Netherlands.

'It's very difficult but unfortunately we are going to have to wait to find out,' he added.

US secretary of state John Kerry said it was 'unacceptable' that investigators still had not got access to the crash site

Meanwhile, US secretary of state John Kerry warned pro-Russian separatists are showing 'an appalling disrespect for human decency' in carrying on fighting close to the MD17 crash site 

The fact that not all the remains of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines disaster in Ukraine had yet been recovered had placed 'an unsupportable burden on families', Mr Kerry said.  

Speaking in Washington DC, Mr Kerry said it was 'unacceptable' that investigators still had not got access to the crash site.

Saying that the Malaysia Airlines plane had been 'tragically shot out of the sky', Mr Kerry added that the victims of the crash and their families 'clearly deserve a thorough, international investigation'.

Such a probe was supported by the United States, he said, adding that America supported the efforts of the Malaysians, the Dutch and the Australians to secure the crash site.

Mr Kerry went on: 'It's absolutely important that separatists stand back to allow access to the site. It is 10 days since the crash and investigators have still not received full, unfettered access to the crash site. They have no way of collecting debris.

'They still cannot ensure that the victims' remains are recovered. That is an unsupportable burden for the families and an unacceptable standard of behaviour.'

He continued: 'Russia meeds to use its considerable influence among separatists to ensure this basic approach to common decency. President (Vladimir) Putin can make a huge difference here is he chooses.'
