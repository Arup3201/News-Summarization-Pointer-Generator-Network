A controversial BBC Panorama programme which sent an undercover team into North Korea, pretending to be a group of LSE students, has breached a number of editorial guidelines.

A report by the corporation's Trust said the BBC failed to ensure the students were aware of the risks involved in the trip.

The BBC has subsequently apologised to the university after the publication concluded LSE experienced 'unfair treatment' because it ended up being linked to the controversial investigation.

Dangerous investigation: BBC Panorama reporter John Sweeney pretended to be a student when he went on a trip to North Korea to film a special programme

For the programme, North Korea Undercover, reporter John Sweeney spent eight days in the pariah state, joining an organised tour which had been planned by his wife, Tomiko Newson.

When the film came to light, it was condemned by senior officials from the university who asked for the programme not to be shown.

But it was screened as planned in April 2013, leading to a complaint from the father of one of the students involved.

Although the Trust believed there was a 'strong public interest' in the broadcast, it said the BBC 'failed to consider a number of important issues and risks, and failed to deal with them appropriately'.

In its report published today, the Trust’s editorial standards committee said: 'The provision of information to the students who took part in the trip was insufficient and inadequate, and meant the daughter of the complainant did not possess the knowledge necessary to give informed consent.'

Danger: Members of the group from the London School of Economics were put at risk, the Trust concluded

In order to gain the appropriate paperwork, the team had used LSE address details for their visa applications. Today’s report said doing so was 'inappropriate and this, combined with other factors, risked linking the LSE with the trip and resulted in unfair treatment to the LSE'.

It went on: 'From the moment the BBC became involved in the trip to North Korea, Tomiko Newson (who was the trip organiser and tour leader) had a conflict of interest which was further compounded when she became employed by the BBC.

'The BBC should have ensured there was someone independent of the programme team present to lead the trip.

Alison Hastings, who chairs the Trust’s editorial standards committee, said: 'Discovering stories in difficult or dangerous places is one of the BBC’s greatest strengths.

'There was a real public interest in making this programme in North Korea but, in the Trust’s view, the BBC failed to ensure that all the young adults Panorama travelled with were sufficiently aware of any potential risks to enable them to give informed consent.

Condemnation: A report published by the BBC Trust said there were 'serious failings' in the organisation of the investigative programme which was broadcast last year

'This was a serious failing, and the BBC is right to apologise to the complainants.'

Sweeney was also accompanied by a cameraman/producer from Panorama in order to make their film and they travelled around the country on a tour given by North Korean guides, and they recorded their visit on the sort of cameras tourists would use, rather than taking specialist equipment.

The Trust found that the problems lay with the gathering rather than the broadcast of the material.

At the time of the broadcast concerns were raised about the impact the programme could have on academics working in sensitive areas around the world.

Following their return from the £2,000-a-head trip, the students were said to have received an email from a North Korean tourism official which said: 'I reserve the right to make public and publish all personal data, including all your passports, to demonstrate that while we have been direct and honest with you, you have broken the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) law.'

Tensions: Tourists have begun to visit the rogue state more frequently, but the group of students allegedly received threats from Pyongyang after the programme was aired

BBC News said it accepted the Trust's decision and said it had apologised to the LSE and the student - referred to as Student X - whose father had complained. But it said that at the time the programme was being made, it believed they were being treated 'fairly'.

In a statement, BBC News said: 'We are pleased that the Trust found that there was a clear and strong public interest in commissioning and broadcasting the programme and that the correct referral procedures and processes were followed by the programme team and senior management.

'We also accept, however, that aspects of the BBC's handling of the project fell short in a number of areas, with the Trust finding against the BBC on four of its 21 rulings.

'In particular we have apologised to Student X for the finding by the Trust that insufficient information was given to her ahead of the trip about the involvement of the BBC journalists and the potential risks, which meant that Student X did not have sufficient knowledge on which to give informed consent.

We have also apologised to the LSE for the Trust's finding that the programme created the risk of harm to the LSE's reputation.

Contact: On their return, the students, who visited a number of attractions in the pariah state during their time received an email saying they had 'broken the law'

'The Trust recognised that this programme involved a number of finely-balanced editorial judgments and that the BBC spent considerable time evaluating the risks in circumstances which were highly unusual. In the planning for and making of the programme, BBC News believed that it was treating all the students and the LSE fairly.'

During its investigation, the committee was told that the BBC's risk assessment had determined that if the team was discovered, they would try to 'separate' themselves from the students but this could have led to them being more vulnerable.

'The committee considered that, while this might well have been a tactic aimed at isolating the students from further risk, it would inevitably have had the effect of preventing Tomiko Newson acting primarily as group leader, and that the students would have been left, in effect, as a group of young adults from a variety of different countries, all personally responsible for trying to extricate themselves from possible detention,' the report said.

The BBC says it has apologised to the university, but suggested there was a 'public interest' in airing the investigation

It concluded that it was not viable for her to lead the trip and be certain of being able to act in the best interests of the students in North Korea from the moment the BBC became involved.

But her relationship with Sweeney was not itself a conflict of interest.

Director of the LSE, Professor Craig Calhoun, said: 'LSE welcomes the finding of the Editorial Standards Committee and the letter of apology issued to the school by the BBC Executive.

'LSE would like to confirm its strong support for the production of programmes in the public interest and for journalists working to highlight important issues in dangerous parts of the world.'
