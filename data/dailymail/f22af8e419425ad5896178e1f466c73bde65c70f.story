An elderly woman who plunged along with her car into a Texas lake miraculously floated out alive as police hauled out the vehicle some fifty minutes after it sank Thursday.

First responders to Lake Houston initially believed they'd be retrieving a dead body along with the car when they were called to the scene.

But the woman was found still alive as the car emerged around 9am, most likely thanks to an air pocket inside the vehicle.

'It was incredible': Sergeant K. Fonville and company were astounded when an unnamed woman emerged from Lake Houston some 50 minutes after her car sank into it Thursday morning

Authorities found her car submerged near a boat ramp off the lake's Duessen Park in about five feet of water, according the Atascocita Observer.

It was assumed, at first to be a recovery mission.

'HCSO responding to vehicle that drove into Deussen Lake. Once towed, a body was recovered. Stay tuned for more information,' tweeted the Harris County Sheriff's Office, rather prematurely, early on Thursday.

They noticed the woman as soon as they pulled out the car.

She'd stayed alive, police believe, with some luck and an airpocket for 45 to 50 minutes.

'It was unbelievable,' said Sergeant K. Fonville.

The woman was taken immediately to the hospital, where she was believed to be in stable condition.

Police were unsure how the accident occurred.
