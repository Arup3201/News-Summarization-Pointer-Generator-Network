A gay politician who made history when he was elected onto a council as a teenager claims he has been forced out of his job by homophobic bullying.

Sam Phripp, 22, was the youngest politician to be elected to Mendip District Council three years ago and also won a seat last year on Somerset County Council.

But the Liberal Democrat councillor claims he has now had to quit the county council because of 'hostility, intimidation and bullying'.

Sam Phripp, 22, said he has stood down from Somerset County Council due to 'hostility, intimidation and bullying'

He claims rival parties went door-to-door telling voters he was gay - and that one colleague even called him a dirty b***** homosexual' during a council meeting.

Announcing his decision on his blog, So Sam Said, Mr Phripp wrote: 'I have to be clear however, that one of the main reasons I'm resigning is because it's becoming almost impossible to do my job properly against the obstruction coming from other politicians.

'I've always been happy to work across party boundaries to get things done. As far as I'm concerned, as soon as the elections are over, we all work together for the good of our areas.

'I've been met with such resistance, and - at times - such hostility, intimidation and bullying that I simply can't and won't go on any further.'

The Liberal Democrat, from Frome, Somerset, first became a councillor aged 19 but said he has since had to deal with homophobic bullying, including being called a 'dirty b***** homosexual'

He continued: 'During attendance at my first ever Council Meeting, my partner overheard me being referred to as 'that dirty b***** homosexual'.

'I've had time taken off sick characterised as time taken off on holiday. I've been chased down the road by a Conservative candidate shouting at me because I'd been speaking to local people outside of a shop.

'I've been harassed on Twitter to the point of having to block and report people - something I always vowed I'd never do.

The 22-year-old, who studied at Bath Spa University, said it had found it 'impossible' to do his job properly due to obstruction from other politicians

Mr Phripp wrote about the reasons behind is resignation on a blog site, So Sam Said, which he has kept up during his time as councillor

'I was told that I'd only won a seat on
 the County Council because I lied (note, I didn't, and haven't 
lied...), I was also told that during recent elections activists from 
other parties had gone door to door telling people that I was gay - as 
if it would be a reason not to vote for me.'

He
 added: 'If ever we ask ourselves why more 'normal' people don't want to
 stand for election, please take that as a 101 from me.'

A spokesman for Somerset County Council said it would not be releasing a statement or launching an investigation as no specific allegations had been made directly to the council.

Mr Phripp, who studied English Literature at Bath Spa University, will remain on Mendip District Council until the next election.
