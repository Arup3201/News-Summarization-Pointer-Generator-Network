With a 49cc engine and top speeds of 40 miles per hour they may not be every petrol-head's idea of a dream ride.

But at just 57 inches long, 100 miles to the gallon and still able to fix a six footer inside, they could solve a few commuting problems.

Fanatical Bruce Weiner has spent the past 15 years fastidiously scouring the world buying up hundreds of the finest microcars.

Now 200 of the world's smallest roadworthy 
vehicles will go to auction - with an estimated hammer price of £7million.

The microcar was created after the Second World War, as America and Great Britain battled with crippling shortages of  food, raw materials, electricity and gas.

It was created as a way of mobilising the population again and while the boom for the tiny mode of transport only lasted around a decade the mini-car has come to embody the post-war spirit.

Mr Weiner's collection includes the iconic Peel P50 and a one-off BMW bubble car which has been transformed into a 730bhp drag car.

But the classic car collector has now decided to sell his entire fleet .

He has enlisted RM Auctions to sell the collection over the weekend of February 15 at the Bruce Weiner Microcar Museum in Madison, Georgia.

One of the star lots is a 1964 Peel P50-  the world's smallest ever production car  and expected to sell for $45,000 (£29,000).

Mr Weiner is also selling 11 BMW Isetta cars including a unique dragster which is powered by a Chevrolet V8 engine.

Lot 267 from the The Bruce Weiner Microcar Museum sale - 1956 Fuldamobil S-6. The microcar was created after the Second World War, as America and Great Britian battled with crippling shortages of food, raw materials, electricity and gas

Lot 584 from the The Bruce Weiner Microcar Museum sale - 1959 BMW Isetta "Whatta Drag" which has been converted into a drag racing car

The model - called Whatta Drag - is inspired by a Hot Wheels toy car and has an estimate of $100,000 (65,000).

The collection ranges from cars built in the 1930s to 2005, with a Smart Crossblade the newest car available with an estimate of £20,000

And an orange 1972 Bond Bug, which was a three-wheel motor built by Reliant, is expected to fetch £12,000.

Mr Weiner, an American businessman, said: 'To me, it's all about the thrill of the chase.

'My collection has brought me incredible joy over the years, but simply finding and restoring these cars is not enough for me. In order to fully appreciate them, I need to share them.

'I'm really looking forward to the sale and happy that these unique cars will be spread to other passionate collectors throughout the world.

'As I see it, we're enlarging the microcar community by letting these go and helping keep history alive.'

The collection ranges from cars built in the 1930s to 2005, with a Smart Crossblade the newest car available with an estimate of £20,000.

There are also a number of German-built Goggomobil microcars including two vans which have been restored and branded with Krispy Kreme and Coca-Cola logos. Both should sell for more than £65,000.

It has estimated the whole fleet could sell for $10.7 million (£6.8m) with an average price of around $50,000 (£32,000) with RM calling the collection the 'finest of its kind'.

Mr Weiner is also selling more than 300 items of memorabilia including books, signs and models.

Rob Myers, founder of RM Auctions, said: 'Bruce Weiner is the consummate collector with an incredible sense of fun and remarkable eye for rarity and quality - elements that are all perfectly reflected in his prized collection.

'As a microcar collection, the Bruce Weiner Museum is unequivocally the finest of its kind worldwide

'With many items having been closely guarded in private ownership, and the vast majority coming to public auction for the first time, the sale is truly unprecedented.

'We are honoured to have been selected by Bruce to present his museum collection, and we look forward to welcoming enthusiasts to what promises to be an unbelievably fun and unforgettable weekend.'

Fans of the minicars include celebrity chef James Martin, who owns one of the first new P50s to be rolled off production lines in over 40 years.

The original bubble cars appeared on Britain's streets in the 1950s and 60s as a solution to post-war material shortages and the need to 'get the nation back to work'.

There was high-demand for the tiny cars after the 1957 Suez Crisis sent fuel prices rocketing sky high.

The BMW Iso Isetta was the first one ever produced when it went into mass production in 1955.

The 7.5ft by 4.5ft car took over 30 seconds to reach 30mph - and had a top speed of just 47mph. The petrol tank held just 13 litres although that was enough to travel more than 150 miles.

But with the arrival of the Austin Mini in 1959 - a tiny vehicle that could carry the whole family - the bubble car slowly disappeared from Britain's roads. The bubble cars were impractical for travelling long distances.

Jeremy Clarkson squeezed his 6ft 5in frame into one of the tiny vehicles on Top Gear last year.

And television's glamorous Holly Willoughby has been filmed taking one for a spin on the way to the X-Factor studios.
