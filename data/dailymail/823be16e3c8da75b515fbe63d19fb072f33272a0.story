If you're thinking of flying to Edinburgh to see in the New Year you might want to think again.

Hotel comparison website trivago.co.uk has compiled a list of the ten most popular destinations worldwide, searched for by UK travellers over 31 December.

What's more, they've included a breakdown of average hotel prices, so guests can see how much local hoteliers are hiking costs in each city to cash in on the oversubscribed party season.

The survey found that London (left) is the most popular New Year destination for UK travellers and New York (right) is the most expensive as hotel prices rise to an average of £407 per night

According to the data, the worst offender for upping prices is Edinburgh, where hotel costs increase by an average of 146 per cent on 31 December. An overnight stay there will cost you £241, compared with an average of £98 per night during December. 

                               Average price on 31 December             Percentage increase from rest of Dec

10.) Glasgow                                  £90                                                             13%

Despite that, the city is the second most popular destination this New Year's Eve, following London and ahead of Amsterdam and Paris.

London is the most popular place to be for the final countdown, followed by Edinburgh and Amsterdam. This year Brits are largely choosing a 'staycation' over trip abroad: five of the top ten cities are located in the UK (London, Edinburgh, Manchester, York and Glasgow). The only long-haul destinations to make the list are Dubai and New York.

Amsterdam is another city to cash in on revellers. Trivago  found that they raise New Year's Eve hotel prices by 132 per cent, just behind Edinburgh, from an average of £104 during December to£242 on the big night.

New York  is the most expensive destination overall: an overnight stay on 31st December will cost an average of £407. Manchester is the only city with no price hikes: the average throughout December and on New Year's Eve is £110.

The data is based on the ten most popular destinations searched for since 1 October by UK travellers. Searches are for any number of nights which include the 31st December. 

The website also found that Brits tend to book in for four nights for the New Year break, spending an average of £147 per night. 

Four star hotels are the preferred choice  (accounting for 47 per cent of hotel searches), followed by three star hotels (28 per cent), five star hotels (16 per cent), and finally one and two star hotels (8 per cent).

Trivago has found that, on average, Amsterdam raises their New Year's Eve prices by 132 per cent to £242

Denise Bartlett, UK Public Relations: 'Edinburgh was criticised earlier this year for price hikes of 36 per cent during the Fringe Festival, when hotel prices increased from an average of £144 in July to £196 in August. 

'Hogmanay is one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations globally and it is unsurprising that hoteliers want to take advantage of the influx of visitors. However, at an average of £241 on 31st December, Hogmanay price hikes are significantly higher than those for the Fringe Festival.

'On the other side of the coin, hoteliers in Manchester should be commended for keeping their prices stable. At an average of £110 on 31st December, Manchester is the second cheapest destination out of the top ten, after Glasgow at £90.'
