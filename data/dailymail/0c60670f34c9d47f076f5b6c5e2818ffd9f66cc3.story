Jose Mourinho and Cesc Fabregas could yet turn out to be a match made in heaven following the Spaniard’s shock move £30million move to Chelsea. But the pair have not always seen eye-to-eye; far from it in fact.

From London to Catalonia, Fabregas and Mourinho have had their run-ins. Their apparent disdain for each other even appeared to turn physical in 2011.

Here, Sportsmail look at some of the incidents that’ll need brushing under the carpet in the coming months.

February 2007

The bad-blood between Mourinho and Fabregas seemed to have started at the Millennium Stadium during the 2007 Carling Cup final between Chelsea and Arsenal.

Having watched John Terry take a brutal kick to the face which resulted in a hospital visit for the Blues captain, it seemed Fabregas was more interested in complaining to the referee about a piece of celery thrown onto the pitch when he was taking a corner.

Then, in the midst of an injury-time melee which saw Kolo Toure, Jon Obi Mikel and Emmanuel Adebayor sent off, the Spaniard grabbed hold of Frank Lampard around the neck, starting a long-running feud.

Even Mourinho ran onto the pitch to get involved.

August 2011

Did Mourinho aim a kick at Fabregas in August 2011 during the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid? It looked that way.

Directly in front of the dugouts, the midfielder was scythed down by Marcelo sparking a mass brawl.

And TV replays of the incident appear to show the then Real Madrid boss aim a sly kick at Fabregas as he lie on the floor in pain.

He didn’t look to make much contact with the midfielder.

But he certainly made contact with with then Barca boss Tito Vilanova just moments later as Mourinho poked his opposite number in the eye. In the aftermath Mourinho branded Barca a ‘small team’.

February 2014

You wonder what Fabregas made of Mourinho’s recent ‘specialist in failure’ comments in reference to Arsene Wenger.

Despite the fact Wenger rejected the opportunity to re-sign Fabregas this summer, the pair maintain a close relationship.

So how will the midfielder feel about playing for a manager who so incisively insulted a man he views as a father figure?

And then, of course, will come the first time Fabregas is asked about Mourinho’s jibe. Just how will he answer? Rock and hard place.

Fabregas told Mourinho to ‘shut-up’ earlier this year after the Chelsea manager said Manchester City would be facing ‘the worst Barcelona for many, many years’ in the Champions League.

The Special One claimed City would have a chance of knocking Barca out of the Champions League because the Catalans are well below their peak.

Fabregas didn’t take too kindly to the comments and after the Spanish club won the first leg of their last-16 tie with City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium he hit back at Mourinho.

‘Some people were talking a bit too much before the game and now they have to shut up for a few days,’ Fabregas said.
