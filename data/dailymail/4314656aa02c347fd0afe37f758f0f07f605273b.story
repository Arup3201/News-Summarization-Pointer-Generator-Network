They do say dogs will eat anything, but a professional footballer was left stunned after vets found ten Brillo Pads in his hungry hound's stomach.

On-loan Southend United midfielder Marc Laird was left with a hefty Â£800 vet bill after his pet pooch Kia swallowed the wiry wash clothes.

The 26-year-old had returned to his home in Brooklands, Manchester, following his team's 1-1 draw at Bury in the FA Cup earlier this month, but was surprised when his five-year-old boxer did not greet him with her usual enthusiasm.

X-ray: Kia needed a two hour operation to remove the Brillo Pads she swallowed when the cupboard door in the kitchen was left open while it was being cleaned

Eats anything: The hungry hound has been known to eat some unusual objects in the past, including one of Marc's compression recovery skins

He said: 'She usually goes mad the second I open the door as I don't get home all that much these days.

'But that day I remember she just wagged her tail a little then wandered back to lie down - I knew something was wrong straight away.

'I had to get back down to London to train but my partner was great and rushed her straight to the vets.

'Next thing I knew she told me that Kia had eaten ten Brillo Pads - not just the normal ones but the wiry ones too.'

Vets at Southfields Veterinary Surgery in Sale Moor, Cheshire, had first thought X-rays showed a large collection of tin foil before stunned nurses opened Kia up and began removing a whole packet of Brillo pads.

Mr Laird said: 'The vets thought it was tin foil at first which left us both a bit confused.

'But when they got them out we eventually worked out that my partner must have left the cupboard door open when she was cleaning the kitchen.

'It could only have been for a few minutes but Kia will eat anything.

Wiry: The fine steel wool cleaning pads don't exactly look particularly appetising

'We had a similar situation when I was at Millwall and she ate one of my recovery skins after I put it on the radiator to dry.

'It was an expensive day but luckily we have pet insurance and everyone at the vets was great.

'Kia is fantastic dog and has never given us any trouble but you just can't leave anything about in our house, even for a second, or she'll eat it.'

Mr Laird lives with his long-term partner of six years, Lindsey Crow, 23, who is currently on maternity leave from her job at Marks and Spencers.

The Scottish star hasn't let his poorly pooch affect his form though after playing a key role in Southend United's recent 11-game unbeaten run in both league and cup whilst on loan in League Two from his parent club, Leyton Orient.

Kia is now recovering at home after her two hour-long surgery.

Paula Gallimore, head nurse at Southfields Veterinary Surgery, said: 'Kia came to the surgery with a little vomiting but we were not overly worried by her condition at first.

'She has had foreign bodies in her before so we took a quick x-ray and we were amazed with what we saw.

'You could clearly make out something large and metallic in her stomach on the X-ray.

'The objects were so big we knew they could not have been passed naturally - even by a large dog.

'It was a very serious situation and we knew that if we left them in her stomach she would have died.

'We took her straight into surgery and pulled out a whole pack of Brillo pads - they just kept coming.

'Afterwards we stitched her up and we are delighted to hear she has made a full recovery.'
