A police officer who downloaded 'extreme' animal porn has walked free from court after he claimed he didn't understand it was illegal.

Alan Rosser, 61, watched 60 videos, downloaded 12 movie clips and looked at 4,988 of the pictures, which contained 'animals' and 'adults'.

But Rosser, who worked as a PCSO for Lincolnshire Police, claimed he had only begun to look at the sickening images 'out of curiosity' after watching a documentary about people having sex with animals.

In court: Alan Rosser, 61, (pictured) watched 60 videos, 
downloaded 12 vile movie clips and looked at 4,988 of the 
pictures, which contained 'animals' and 'adults'. However, he said he looked at the pictures out of curiosity

Rosser, described as popular and hardworking, had been a PCSO since 2003 but quit his job after his computer was seized during a raid at his home on December 14, 2010.

Sentencing him at Lincoln Crown Court on Monday, Judge Michael Heath said Rosser 'didn't understand it to be illegal' to download or view the material.

Rosser, of Welton, near Lincoln, pleaded guilty to six charges of possessing extreme pornography. He was given a three-year community order with a three-month curfew.

Rosser was also ordered to attend a sex offenders' rehabilitation course and his computer was confiscated.

Laura Pitman, prosecuting, said: 'A search warrant was executed by police officers at the defendant's home address. Seized were a number of items, including his computer.

'That computer was examined and images of extreme pornography, involving adults and animals was discovered.

'He was subsequently interviewed and admitted he knew these images were on his computer.

'He said he watched a documentary on the television about people having sexual intercourse with animals. Simply out of curiosity, he went on a website that contained adult pornography.

'He said he started to watch a number of films. He said the last time was about a year before they had executed the search warrant. That would be in 2009.

'When the police examined his computer they found 12 live movie clips that he could still watch.'

Stephen Grattage, defending, said: 'He was a PCSO for several years and was well regarded.

'He did a good job and always tried to keep himself within the law. He didn't realise that this was a criminal offence.

'He was very upset that he had crossed that line. It was an error on his part.

'When this man was charged, he was so shaken that he was actually held in custody for a short while for his own safety.

'All of the films that depicted extreme pornography were found in areas consistent with being stored automatically by the internet browser.

'Mr Rosser was surprised when he heard the number. He had viewed something like 60 video clips.'

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Evison of the Lincolnshire Police professional standards department said the investigation it should serve as a 'warning' to other officers.

He said: 'It is always disappointing when a member of staff breaks the law or falls below the high standards of conduct that the force demands of all our employees.

'The investigation into Mr Rosser should serve as a warning to other persons within our organisation that we will investigate and prosecute offenders like him.

'Hopefully this robust policy will offer some reassurance to the public that the force fully intends to seek out wrong doers and to rightly uphold the high standards expected of us.'
