A frightening wasp nest containing 'more than a million' yellow jacket wasps has been found in Central Florida.

Entomologist and bee removal expert Jonathon Simkins was alerted to the ominous mound, 1000 times bigger than the average nest, on a privately-owned hunting ground near Tampa recently and filmed as thousands of wasps tried to sting him.

'I have never seen a nest this large in my entire life,' Simkins, who has been working in the insect business for more than 20 years said. 'This is the prehistoric nest from the dinosaur ages.'

Ouch: The monster wasp nest, pictured, was discovered on a private property in central Florida

Exterminator: Jonathon Simkins, pictured, said he was terrified as he attempted to kill the wasps

He told WFLA that an everyday nest might contain anywhere between 1,000 to 5,000 insects.

But
this monster nest was six and a half feet tall and eight feet wide and 
probably contained 'more than a million' wasps including thousands of 
queens.Â 

Simkins set out to eliminate the nest, only to find himself being attacked by countless worker wasps.

In his nerve-wracking video of the nest 
before he eradicated it, the buzz of hundreds of wasps smashing against 
the camera is clearly audible while Simkins' voice is tense as the scary
insects engulf the air.

Millions: Simkins said there were more than a million wasps in the mound, which was the biggest he'd ever seen

'I have to be honest with you, I was terrified at one point,' he told the TV station.

'There were several times that I had to pull out and get a breather. My heart rate was racing, I had hundreds of them on my veil.'

Eventually the terminator - whose 
company is called Insect IQ, managed to kill the entire nest with a good
spray and his own technique, details of which he hasn't disclosed.

Miraculously, Simkins managed to walk
away with only a single sting on his chin. If anyone else had stumbled 
across the mound they probably wouldn't have been so lucky, he said.

Dead: Two days after the extermination Simkins, pictured, shows how the nest is dead

Dangerous: The frightening nest of yellow jacket wasps, like that pictured, would have been awfully dangerous to anyone who came across it

'We definitely did save lives,' he told WFLA. 'If somebody comes across this, you're not going to get away. You can see in the video, I run a hundred yards away and I sill have thousands of yellow jackets chasing me, all over me, trying to kill me.'

Simkins returns to the nest two days after the extermination to show that it is completely dead and his work is done.

'It was so exciting. Definitely one of best times in my business and professional career to deal with something like this,' he said.
