Three college friends of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect will be tried separately, but those trials do not need to be moved out of Massachusetts, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.

Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled that Azamat Tazhayakov will stand trial on June 30, followed by Dias Kadyrbayev on September 8 and Robel Phillipos on September 29.

Their lawyers had asked the federal judge to move the trial out of state, saying that overwhelming media coverage of the case would mean that their clients won't receive fair trials in Massachusetts.

Woodlock said the defendants could receive fair trials in Boston, or if need be, in Springfield, 80 miles west of Boston. He pointed to the trial of Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger, which was held in Boston despite the case's high profile.

Prosecutors opposed the venue change but didn't object to severing the trials.

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are Kazakhstan nationals who are charged with tampering with evidence for removing Tsarnaev's laptop and a backpack containing fireworks from his college dorm room shortly after last year's fatal bombing.

Kadyrbayev also faces conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. He and Tazhayakov have been held without bail for more than a year.

Phillipos, of Cambridge, is charged with lying to investigators. He has been held under house arrest.

The Kazakhs, who have been held in 
federal custody on immigration violations since their arrest days after 
the attack, were allowed to appear in court in dress shirts and 
trousers, rather than prison jumpsuits. Phillipos, who is out on bail, 
arrived in a light gray business suit and tie.

Each pleaded not guilty. All three sat quietly in the courtroom as Tuesday's hearing began.

Their lawyers have also asked the judge to strike references to 'terrorism' from the charges, noting prosecutors have not contended that the three played any role in the bombing attack.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is awaiting 
trial on charges linked to the bombing and faces the threat of execution
 if he is convicted.

His older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 
died in a gun battle with police three days after the attack as the 
siblings attempted to escape the city.

He and his older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, allegedly placed two pressure cooker bombs near the marathon finish line.

Three days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gunbattle with police, the same night Massachusetts Institute of Technology security officer Sean Collier was shot and killed.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is facing state charges in Collier's death.

Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in Tsarnaev's trial, which is set to begin in November.

Defense lawyers for the three friends also filed motions to suppress some evidence, which Woodlock did not immediately rule on.

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice, which carry a penalty of up to 25 years in prison.

Phillipos faces a less serious charge of lying to investigators, which carries a possible 16-year sentence.
