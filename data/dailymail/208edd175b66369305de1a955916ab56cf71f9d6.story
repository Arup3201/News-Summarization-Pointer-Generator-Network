Ejected: Rachael Pagani, 20, pictured here in a Facebook image, was being thrown out of the Walkabout bar in Carlisle when she threw a champagne bottle across the dancefloor

A former international ice skater who knocked a woman unconscious with a champagne bottle 'for no reason' has been jailed.

Rachael Pagani, who had 'tremendous potential' as a young ice skating champion, hurled a bottle across a crowded nightclub dancefloor after being thrown out the Walkabout bar in Carlisle.

The 20-year-old became involved in a scuffle with other revellers in the club and was escorted from the bar after the row in December.

But as she collected her bag, Ms 
Pagani grabbed a champagne bottle and threw it across the packed 
dancefloor, striking Hayley Dodgson, 20, on the back of the head.

Miss Dodgson was rushed to hospital and treated for a 3cm gash to the head after the incident.

Pagani,
who represented the Great Britain as a 'very talented' teen ice skater,
wept in court yesterday as she was sentence to eight months in a young 
offenders' institute.

She
had initially tried to blame the bottle throwing on someone else, but 
later admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm after her fingerprints 
were found on the champagne bottle.

Carlisle
Crown Court heard that Pagani, from Dumfries, had been out celebrating 
her birthday when the scuffle broke out in the crowded nightspot.

Alan Lovett, prosecuting, told the court: 'In the bar there is a dance floor area. Both groups were dancing on the dance floor when a scuffle broke out.

'While being escorted out of the bar by door staff the defendant picked up a bottle and threw it over her shoulder across the crowded dance floor in the direction of the other group.'

The court heard the incident was the second time Pagani had been in court for violence in a nightclub.

Judge Barbara Forrester told her: 'The injury could have been far worse.

'Anyone who throws a bottle into a crowd of people is likely to cause serious injury.

Carlisle Crown Court heard Pagani hurled the champagne bottle across a crowded dancefloor for 'no reason'

'I have thought about this for some time. This offence took place in a licensed premises when people were out enjoying themselves.

'For no reason you threw a bottle over your shoulder.

'You had no concern over the injury it would cause. It caused serious injury and could have been even worse.

'This behaviour is totally unacceptable. It quite clearly passes the custody threshold.'

Following the sentencing, a family friend of Pagani told the Daily Telegraph: 'You see a lot of cases of young people being jailed after being brought up in terrible backgrounds where they never had a chance.

'But Rachel is a girl from a wealthy background who has had a lot of opportunities. It really is unbelievable.

'She was a very good skater, very talented.'
