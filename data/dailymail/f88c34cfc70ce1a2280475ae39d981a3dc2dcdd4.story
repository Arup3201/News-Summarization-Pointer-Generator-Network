Apple yesterday became  the most valuable public  company in history.

The share price of the technology firm rocketed to £423.33 in frenzied trading, taking the total value of its shares to £395billion.

Apple was already the No.1 on companies’ current value, a position it has held since dethroning oil giant Exxon Mobil last August.

Move over, Microsoft: Apple have become the world's most valuable company ever, taking the title off Microsoft. Monday's stock saw the company valued at $623 billion

Soaring: Apple's stock hit $664.74 in midday trading before retreating slightly to $663 - its surging stock propelled the company's value to $623 billion

But a doubling of its market 
capitalisation value in just 17 months means it has now knocked its 
rival technology firm Microsoft from the all-time top spot.

The surge in share price has been 
driven by the impending arrival of Apple’s latest gadget, the 
fifth-generation iPhone, which is expected to go on sale in the UK in 
October.

This list shows the market value (in $m) of the top ten global 500 companies, as of June 29 2012:

1 Apple 546,076

2 Exxon Mobil 400,139

3  PetroChina 257,685

4 Microsoft 256,982

5 Wal-Mart 235,900

6 IBM 225,598

7 General Electric 220,806

8 China Mobile 219,481

9 Royal Dutch Shell 217,048

10 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China 211,196

Previous generations of the smartphone have been a major success for the firm.

Speculation that Apple is gearing up to launch a cut-price iPad tablet computer has also boosted the share price.

Until yesterday Bill Gates’s Microsoft
 had held the title of the all-time most valuable publicly traded 
company since December 1999, the peak of the ‘dotcom bubble’, when its 
market capitalisation flirted with the £394billion mark.

But Microsoft’s worth is now about a third of Apple’s as it struggles to fend off competitors.    

Microsoft was quick to hit back 
yesterday, with an insider stating: ‘Obviously, criteria for being the 
most valuable company are not well defined.

‘We don’t need to change direction. 
Unlike Apple we have a long-lasting relationship with enterprise clients
 where we can do business on a larger scale.’

Detractors also point out that with inflation Microsoft’s 1999 valuation would be worth around £536.5billion at today’s prices.
