After Warren Gatland insisted he had picked his starting XV to face Australia based on form, his Wales squad looked focused in training ahead of the game on Saturday.

Gatland has mixed up his squad ahead of the match at the Millennium Stadium as he looks to end Wales' poor record against the southern hemisphere's 'big three' - Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

Gatland left Adam Jones out of the squad completely despite the prop's 95-cap experience, while 42-cap Bradley Davies and the Lions duo of Gethin Jenkins and Mike Phillips have been named on the bench.

Wales are looking to end a record which has seen them go 20 matches since beating any of them, and there were concerns that this had become a psychological battle for them to overcome. 

Gatland may find some comfort in the fact it was Australia who were the last team from the 'big three' they beat. That was back in November 2008 when they won 21-18. 

‘Our primary focus over the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the World Cup,’ said Gatland. ‘Although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and Six Nations and those are important games for us, the long-term objective is getting out of that group and making the quarter-finals.’

‘A lot of people have been talking about what’s happened with Kurtley Beale (he was fined £24,600 for sending an offensive picture message to an Australian Rugby Union female team official) and those sorts of things. Does that make them more vulnerable? With Australians, it makes them stronger. So we are expecting a really tough game.’
