A Florida man has been arrested for imprisoning and trying to perform an exorcism on his elderly girlfriend.

David Edward Benes, 54, is accused of imprisoning his 80-year-old girlfriend in their Holiday, FL., home Sept 16 and 17 while trying to perform a drunken, violent two day exorcism on her, according to a police report. This is not the first time he's run afoul of the law for drinking and violence.

The couple has lived together for three years, the report said.

A history of violence: David Edward Benes appears to have been in court multiple times on battery and alcohol-related charges

Police arrived at the house of horrors Sept 17 to find the battered elderly woman’s arms covered in bruises and scratches, said the report.

Mr Benes was ‘too intoxicated to talk,’ the arresting officer wrote in the arrest report.

The allegedly possessed woman told police she and Mr Benes were involved in a physical altercation the previous evening that ended when her bombed boyfriend physically restrained her because he was trying to ‘exorcise her and get the devil out of her’ against her will.’

The helpless woman was then told by Mr Benes she was not allowed to leave the house, took her car keys, dismantled the garage door opener and even took the batteries out of all the phones to prevent her from calling for help.

The victim then awoke in the morning to Mr Benes again ‘exorcising’ her,’ she told cops.

Police observed bruising and scratching on the woman’s arms, as well as the batteries having been removed from the house phones, they wrote in the report.

Mr Benes later claimed he was black out drunk and that his elderly girlfriend had hit him first, said the report.

Charged with battery on a person 65-years or older, and various other charges, Mr Benes is currently in jail without bail.

A MailOnline search of criminal records yielded a lengthy, violent history dating back to 1992 under the name David Edward Benes. After his first battery charge was abandoned that year, Mr Benes was twice convicted of battery in 1994 and found guilty of DUI in 1997.

Mr Benes was also twice found guilty of violating an order of protection, once in 2012 and again earlier this month. He was also found guilty in 1998 of driving with an open container of alcohol, records showed.
