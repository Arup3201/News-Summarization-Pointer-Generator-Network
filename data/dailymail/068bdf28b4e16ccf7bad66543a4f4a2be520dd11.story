A Premier League player has been left furious after he was victim of a gruesome prank by teammates who left a pig's head in his locker in the club's changing rooms.

Kenwyne Jones, a striker for Stoke City, opened the locker to find a 'huge bloody pig's head in his clothes', according to his girlfriend, who today launched into an angry Twitter tirade directed at other players.

Reports claim that Jones then smashed the car windscreen of another Stoke player in retaliation for the practical joke.

The team's manager Tony Pulis today launched an investigation into the incident, which comes just two days before the final day of the Premier League season.

Hamming it up: Brek Shea posted this image of him holding a pig's head in the Stoke changing room

Some players appeared to make light 
of the prank - defender Brek Shea tweeted an image of someone holding up
a pig's head in the team's dressing room, captioned, 'Dressing room 
banter gone wild!'

The image, which the American posted on his Instagram page, shows a player holding the head by its ears, with what 
appears to be a large gash in the middle of its head.

It seems that the head at some point ended up in the locker belonging to Jones, a 28-year-old Trinidadian who has played for Stoke for three years.

The footballer's girlfriend Kissa Abdullah wrote on Twitter: 'Big men acting like kids a pigs head is not a prank its just 
disgusting!!!!! Wtf??? I don't get how was that sup 2 be funny!!!! 
Really???

'They put a huge bloody pigs head in his clothes at training. He warned them 2 keep out of the banter or else! u kno the rest.'

Anger: Kenwyne Jones' partner spoke out against the prank on her twitter, hinting at religious outrage

Not happy: Kenwyne Jones is believed to be the 'victim' of the prank, and is understood to be angry

She added: 'Listen 4 all those who don't get it lay the f! back! Where I
come from that's not anywhere close 2 funny! Esp not knowing religious 
beliefs,' before concluding, 'It just takes a minute to be sensitive to 
someone's beliefs no one says u
can't have a sense of humour but let it be a joke! This wasn't!'

Some sources have suggested that Jones was so angry about the head that he attacked another player's car.

Stoke City said in a statement: 'The Club takes seriously reports of an incident at our training ground this afternoon.

'A full internal investigation will be carried out and those responsible for any unacceptable behaviour will be dealt with in accordance with the Club's disciplinary procedures.'

Happy Sunday: Michael Owen woke up to find his car caked in eggs and flour before his final game

Apparently not all the Stoke team were equally appalled at the joke.

Heather Weir, girlfriend of Jones's teammate Jamie Ness, commented on the image saying: 'Totally love my boyfriend coming home to tell me a pig's head was 
getting passed round the changing rooms!'

This is not the first over-the-top prank to take place at Stoke in the past week.

Michael Owen, the former England 
legend who is retiring this season, was given an unwelcome send-off by 
his team-mates ahead of his final home game.

He posted a picture on Twitter of his
black Mercedes C63 covered in eggs and flour and wrote: 'This is what I
will miss once I hang up my boots! Looks like I may be delayed getting 
to the match #eggs&flour'.

Then the striker began to list possible culprits, naming Dean Whitehead and Glenn Whelan as the most likely mischief-makers.
