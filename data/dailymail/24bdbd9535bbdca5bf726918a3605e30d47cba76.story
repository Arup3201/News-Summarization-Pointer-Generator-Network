Countless lives will be endangered by the Government’s ‘misguided’ privatisation of land and sea rescue service, critics warned Tuesday.

Stranded mountain climbers and sailors on stricken ships will be put at risk by the decision to hand search and rescue (SAR) operations to a US company, it was claimed.

A £1.6billion deal, confirmed yesterday, saw ministers wrench responsibility from the RAF and Royal Navy after 70 years, in favour of Texas-based Bristow Group.

At risk: Rescue helicopter services such as those flown by Prince William, will now be operated by a private American company

The Government pushed ahead with the sale despite objections from Prince William, a Flight Lieutenant who commands a SAR crew at RAF Valley in Anglesey, North Wales.

As ministers announced the plans, the prince was believed to have been at the controls of an RAF helicopter that rescued a family stranded by wintry weather on a Welsh hillside. A family of five, including a 16-month-old baby, were cut off by 10ft snowdrifts and had been forced to burn furniture to keep warm after a power cut.

They believe the Duke of Cambridge, known as Flight Lieutenant Wales when on duty, was flying the Sea King that plucked them to safety.

One of those rescued, Ben Massam, 22, a shopworker from Bryneglwys, near Llangollen, said: ‘I’m grateful to the RAF, they did a brilliant job.’

He said of the privatisation: ‘If it ain’t bust, don’t fix it.’

Bristow will also take over civilian SAR bases run by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).

Until 2007, Bristow had run rescue missions for the MCA for 24 years.

But
concerns have been raised because Bristow is axing two of the 12 SAR 
bases and reducing the total helicopter fleet from 24 to 22. The deal 
also spells the end for the distinctive yellow Sea King helicopters, in 
favour of Sikorsky S92 and AgustaWestland AW189 aircraft.

The
Department for Transport said that under the new regime rescuers will 
reach emergencies more swiftly and could cover larger areas of the 
country.

But defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said privatising such 
services ‘brings a lot of dangers’, adding: 'Going to a PFI, which this essentially is, brings a lot of dangers.'

Callouts have gone up 40 per cent since 2005, this is a big operation, a lot of people's lives are at risk here.

'Will the private sector operation take on the same sort of risks that the RAF, Royal Navy and Maritime and Coastguard Agency do, on the same scale? I rather doubt they will.'

Bristow, the Texan firm that won the contract, will use the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, which it already uses to transport offshore oil workers in the UK

Angus
Robertson, Scottish National Party defence spokesman, said: ‘The 
privatisation of military helicopter search and rescue services is 
misguided. It will end the role of military air crew in these 
life-saving flights, which is a bad move.

‘The public has come to trust and value the military search and rescue service and this privatisation is wrong.’

The lucrative ten-year contract, starting in 2015, will be managed by the MCA. All bases will operate 24 hours a day.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘Our SAR helicopter service plays a crucial role.

‘The public can have great confidence in Bristow and its ability to deliver a first-class service.’

Military personnel involved in SAR will be able to apply to leave the service and take a job with the private contractor.

The changes are not expected to directly impact the Duke of Cambridge who is due to finish as a SAR pilot later this spring.
