Charged: Maine resident Sidney Kilmartin (pictured) is accused of sending the poison to former soldier Andrew Denton's home in Hull 

An American man who posted cyanide to a suicidal Englishman who later took his own life has been charged in connection to the death.

Maine resident Sidney Kilmartin, 52, is accused of sending the poison to former soldier Andrew Denton's home in Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire in 2012, according to papers filed with the U.S. District Court.

British and U.S authorities launched a joint investigation after learning Denton, 49, had ordered the potassium cyanide online and used it to commit suicide after struggling with depression.

Over 18 months, officers were able to track the mail order down to Kilmartin's home in the town of Windham, near Portland. He was arrested and charged with mailing injurious articles resulting in death - a crime that could result in him spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.

Potassium cyanide is a highly toxic, colorless salt often used in gold mining and electroplating. Exposure to it can result in rapid death.

The court papers say Kilmartin, who lived in South Windham, posted the poison 'with the intent to kill or injure another.'

Authorities arrested Kilmartin yesterday morning, and he remains in custody in the Maine city of Bangor, Attorney Halsey B. Frank said.

Kilmartin is understood to have pleaded not guilty to the crime during a primarily court hearing yesterday.

He is expected to make a second appearance at a detention hearing scheduled for November 14, according to Inquisitr.

Officers are said to be in the dark as to how Kilmartin came into possession of the deadly cyanide, as he is not thought to have worked in industries where the product was used.

Kilmartin could have faced the death penalty if convicted, but U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder intervened and declined to seek it in this case, the Portland Press Herald reported.

At the court hearing, Kilmartin's attorney, Jeffrey Silverstein, asked that a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity be recorded.

Location: Holland Street in Hull where former soldier Andrew Denton lived before his suicide in 2012

At Mr Denton’s inquest in Hull, the coroner’s court was told that remnants of potassium cyanide had been found at his home. The toxicology report confirmed that he had died from cyanide poisoning.
