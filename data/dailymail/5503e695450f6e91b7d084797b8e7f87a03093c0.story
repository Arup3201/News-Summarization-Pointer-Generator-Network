Mauricio Pochettino has overcome his first hurdle toward becoming a successful Tottenham manager; he has Ossie Ardiles’ blessing.

‘I spoke with Ossie after I signed,’ said Pochettino. ‘And I met with Ricardo Villa at the last game I played at White Hart Lane with Southampton. Ossie told me it was a good decision joining Spurs. He said: “Well done”. He’s happy.

‘Ossie is in love with Tottenham and he’s an idol here. All he told me about Tottenham was great, unbelievable. And now I can invite him to a barbecue at my house to spend time with him.’

Pochettino and Ardiles certainly would not be short of conversation. Both Argentinian, both have played for the national team and, now, both have managed Tottenham.

Of course, their international playing careers took somewhat different paths. Pochettino was just six when Ardiles helped Argentina to World Cup glory in 1978 in Buenos Aires. ‘I watched the game on a black and white TV. It was unbelievable,’ said Pochettino, whose Argentina career was not quite so illustrious.

His 20 caps are best remembered on these shores for his clumsy challenge on Michael Owen during the World Cup 2002 group stages that led to David Beckham’s penalty in England’s 1-0 win. However, Pochettino hopes he can go on to emulate and even surpass Ardiles’ legendary status at Tottenham.

Helping Spurs break back into the top four would be the best start to his Spurs career and a 2-1 win over Schalke in their final pre-season game will give them confidence. But the 42-year-old insists his job security does not hinge on qualification for the Champions League.

Good decision: Former Tottenham star Ardiles has told Pochettino that he made the right choice

‘I don’t have any specific targets,,’ said Pochettino. ‘Yes, I’m confident I will be given time by the chairman. We need time to decide and make the right decisions.

‘Tottenham is a big club, you always need to win every game. But at the moment we need to develop our philosophy, our style. And at the same moment, you need to provide the club and the players with a new philosophy or new style.

‘It’s true our style is playing attacking football, pressing high and giving our fans enjoyment of the game. But then you need to get results. We need to play to win and, in our style and our philosophy, to keep the ball and play forward and not to change anything whether you play Real Madrid [or not].’

Winners: Tottenham defeated Schalke 2-1 in a pre-season friendly at White Hart Lane on Saturday

Pochettino is confident that his excellent spell at Southampton will leave him in a better position to make a success of his latest role, starting at West Ham on Saturday.

He said: ‘Adapting is always difficult. And when you take a job in the Premier League, all clubs have a difficult situation. All players who arrived from a different league — when they don’t speak the same language, it’s difficult to adapt. When I stayed in Spain, I said, “The English league, it’s OK.

Learning: The new Spurs boss is confident his spell at Southampton will has left him in a good position  

'It’s competitive”. But, when you arrive, you say, “Ooh, it’s hard — it’s very hard”. And, after, you realise that it’s the most competitive league. I stayed in France and in Spain. It’s not the same. Here, it’s hard.

‘I had an unbelievable year and a half at Southampton. I enjoyed it a lot. I hope I enjoy it here too.’

In the groove: Emmanuel Adebayor was on the score sheet for Spurs on Saturday afternoon
