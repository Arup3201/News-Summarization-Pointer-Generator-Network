Every year on Strictly Come Dancing, the stars taking part reveal how they dropped pounds thanks to rehearsing and performing and they leave the show the fittest they've ever been.

Now Strictly professional dancers Natalie Lowe and Ian Waite, along with former contestant Mark Foster, want to help the show-loving public get the same results by launching a dance workout called FitSteps.

The 45 minute class is similar to Zumba - so you don't need a partner - and it includes moves from Latin and ballroom dances.

No need for a partner: Natalie leads a class demonstrating the dance moves for participants to follow

It provides an all-body workout with energetic moves from the Jive, Cha Cha and Samba included to raise the heart
rate. Meanwhile, a range of slower movements and postures from the 
Waltz and the Rumba use muscular strength to tone the torso, arms 
and legs.

Natalie, 33, told the MailOnline: 'It's an intense workout but because you're concentrating on learning the steps and having fun dancing, you don't notice how hard you're working.'

She added: 'What's also exciting about it is 
you're learning a skill as we teach the basic foundation of ballroom and Latin American dancing. You don't even need to try and convince 
your reluctant partner to join you, as you'll be working out alongside a
whole class of like-minded people. You'll get fit, boost your 
confidence, make friends and have a great time doing so.'

Join in: The classes are operating at 700 venues around the country

Natalie has been dancing since she was three-years-old and she said the classes are suitable for adults of all ages (they're working on launching a separate FitSteps class for children).

She said participants can burn up to 600 calories a session and those already taking part in the classes around the country have been seeing the results.

Nesta Lopez, who attends classes in Dagenham, Essex, said: 'It's the best thing I've done in years. The support, the atmosphere, drive and fun keep me coming back. The first time I tried it I thought to myself, "this is something I will never get right", but class after class, the steps got easier and more achievable.

'I'm enjoying myself and best of all my body is getting firmer. so I've said "goodbye love handles" and my bum is lifted like never before. I am feeling much more confident in my own skin.'

Many celebrities who have taken part in the BBC show also attest that they've slimmed down thanks to dancing.

Convert: Olympic swimmer Mark, right, said he loved learning to dance and lost weight when he appeared on Strictly. He joined forces with Ian and Natalie to help other people have the experience he enjoyed

The Strictly effect: This year's contestant Susanna Reid, left, has already lost 7lb, while John Sergeant dropped two stone when he took part in 2008

One contestant this year, Susanna Reid, has admitted she's lost 7Ib so far and in previous series, actor Ricky Groves and presenter John Sergeant shed more than two stone each.

And it's not just their waistlines that benefit from taking part, many of them also come away with a newfound love of dancing thanks to being taught by a professional.

It's something Olympic swimmer Mark Foster experienced after his appearance on the show in 2008.

'I had a great time when I was on the 
show but when I realised how
much weight I'd lost, I wanted to explore the concept of getting fit 
through stepping,' he said.

'After speaking to some professional fitness colleagues and then
reaching out to Natalie, it turned out that Ian had already been 
working on a similar concept, so after much discussion and development 
we joined forces and FitSteps was born.'

Ian added: 'The great thing about FitSteps is that 
it’s varied. Because of the differences in techniques and 
tempo of the dances, the postures are grouped together to create 
different effects on the body and achieve the results you want. There's 
absolutely no way you’ll have as much fun pounding the treadmill as you 
will learning to Jive.'

Dance into shape: Up to 600 calories can be burnt per class as moves from Latin and ballroom routines are learnt

Natalie said the classes teach the same basic dance moves that the celebrities learn when they first sign up for Strictly. It's only when they've started to master these that their professional partner will teach them the choreographed routines.

The Australian dancer - whose biggest success on Strictly came when she reached the final with Hollyoaks actor Ricky Whittle in 2009 - said it's rewarding to be able to reach so many people through FitSteps.

She explained: 'I love dancing, it's good for the heart, the soul and the mind. Dancing is in my blood and I love teaching the celebrities I've worked with on Strictly. But you are only teaching one person. These classes allow us to reach thousands of people and help them get fit while having fun.'

FitSteps classes are being run in 700 locations around the country in gyms and community centres as well as at Champneys health spas and 
Rosemary Conley Clubs.

But of course Natalie, Ian and Mark can't teach all the classes themselves so 1,200 licenced instructors have been trained in order to deliver the workout.

Looking head, Natalie said they plan to launch the children's classes as well as aqua FitSteps (the workout in water) and 'golden era' FitSteps - a class at a slower pace focusing on ballroom dancing to music from the 30s and 40s.

Natalie has been unable to take part in this year's Strictly after suffering from a foot injury and so has been a keen - if not a little jealous - viewer instead.

She said: 'I'm gutted I couldn't take part in this year's series after getting two stress fractures in my foot. I've been resting and recovering so there's a chance I might be able to take part in the group numbers towards the end of the series. But I will have to see how I am, I want to make sure I'm recovered so I'm definitely back next year.'

When it comes to who'll make the final this year, she thinks it's too close to call.

'The competition is heating up,' she exclaimed. 'The girls like Abbey and Susanna have been great from the start but now the boys are upping the ante as Patrick and Ashley are improving every week. I couldn't pick a winner.'
