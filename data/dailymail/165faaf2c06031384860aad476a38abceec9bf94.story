Oh deer: A spot of game hunting ended in disaster on Friday when a 72-year-old bowman was apparently hurt by the prey he had shot

Action Reporter Media says the extent of his injury remains unknown.

The man was reportedly hunting shortly before 7:30 pm on January 2 with a crossbow when he struck a doe.

In a bid to check its condition, he went tracking the animal.

Fond du Lac County sheriff's officer Jeff Bonack says  the man was going through thick brush when the doe jumped out.

After hitting the hunter, the deer ran away.

It is not known if the arrow remained embedded in its body. Luckily the man was with family when the freak accident occurred and they were able to call for help.

Fond du Lac County is deemed a 'hunter's paradise' with a healthy stock of deer, turkey, waterfowl and pheasant.

But the latest incident serves as a reminder for enthusiasts to be vigilant at all times.
