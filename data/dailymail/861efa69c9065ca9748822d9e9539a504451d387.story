Again it was all about the team sheet. Another Champions League night for Liverpool, more intense scrutiny on the names Brendan Rodgers unveiled before kick-off.

In Madrid three weeks ago, Rodgers caused a hullabaloo when making wholesale changes to his starting line-up, drawing criticism for appearing to run up the white flag before their collision with the defending champions.

This time, though, his selection was far more significant. On a freezing cold night in Sofia, Rodgers decided that Liverpool needed to be solid, they needed experience and composure – and he sent out a team containing just two of the signings he made this summer.

Rodgers does not duck away from making big calls but on night when he was under intense pressure this was revealing. He spent more than £110million on nine acquisitions but only Rickie Lambert (£4million from Southampton) and Javier Manquillo (loan from Atletico Madrid) made the cut.

Both of those, it must be noted, performed with credit. Lambert got a goal – his second in as many matches – at a crucial stage and led the line purposefully, while Manquillo defended stoically; he did all that was asked of him, standing tall, keeping possession and firing into tackles.

But there was no Alberto Moreno, the young left back who came from Sevilla. He was consigned to the bench along with Dejan Lovren (the most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history), Adam Lallana and Emre Can. In effect, £67million wrapped up in blankets to repel the cold.

Lazar Markovic was nowhere to be seen. He cost £20million but has been so underwhelming that he is yet to provide a goal or an assist. Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, was back at home, resting his injured groin. Neither of them were missed.

That shouldn’t be the case. Rodgers pointed out in March, when discussing Tottenham, that when a clubs spend huge sums of money they 'should expect to be challenging for the league'; it could be argued, then, that spending huge sums of money should at the very least improve a team.

It is why this team sheet was far more enlightening than the one that was produced in Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. This, in not so many words, was Rodgers saying he could not trust those expensively assembled recruits to do a job when it was most required.

‘We needed the squad rebuilt,’ Rodgers explained last month. ‘That decision was made (knowing) players might struggle a bit initially but in the future they would be big players for the club. That is where we are at. Are we playing as fluent as we were last season? No.

'But is there big potential in the team? I believe there is. It may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season. As I said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent.’

Any team would have been hurt by the sale of Luis Suarez but it said everything here that Rodgers needed to summon players who have been sparingly used. Take Lucas Leiva. The Brazil midfielder faces an uncertain future and has been linked with moves away but he came in and was stoic.

There was nothing flash or fancy about what he did but he won tackles and cajoled his team-mates, scuffling for possession when it ended up at the feet of those in green. Lucas, who was courted by Napoli in August, doesn’t do a glamorous job but he does it selflessly and it allows other to thrive.

Brendan Rodgers decided to leave the majority of his summer recruits in the cold against Ludogorets

Steven Gerrard, for one, looked more comfortable with Lucas in behind him. The 4-1-4-1 formation also brought out flashes of the best from Jordan Henderson, who motored forward to score the games decisive goal, and the outstanding Raheem Sterling.

Toure, another who could have left during the transfer window with Turkish clubs interested, had some erratic moments but he performed far better than Lovren has done, sticking his head out time and again to preserve Liverpool’s lead. The added spin-off of Toure’s performance was Martin Skrtel playing with considerably more composure.

Rodgers cannot leave the Ivorian out against Stoke on Saturday as was the case when he failed to retain his place after excelling against Madrid; he has done more in his last two performances than Lovren has managed since he arrived from Southampton.

‘You just have to be patient with him,’ Rodgers argued after Lovren had scored a winning goal against Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup. ‘He’ll be a top centre-half for this club. He is a big talent. Once he has this year and finds the levels of working here, he will do very, very well. The problem is that players are judged so early now.’

That may be so but they are judged for a reason. When they come at a premium price, the demand for them to start producing is instant and none of Liverpool’s big buys have shown they are capable of making an impact yet.

Had they been able to, Rodgers would have included them. He did not spend all that money with the support of Fenway Sports Group to put together an expensive bench. He brought them to make a difference when in the games that truly matter.

In spending the night watching the action unfold in front of them, we can safely say Rodgers does not believe they are ready. So the question remains: will they ever?
