Rescued: British female jihadi Umm Khattab al-Britaniyya (pictured) blogged about her release

A British female jihadi has claimed the Islamic State (IS) sent a lawyer to secure her release from a Turkish prison so she could join the terror group in Syria.

Eighteen-year-old Umm Khattab al-Britaniyya describes in her blog how IS commanders arranged for a lawyer to come to the prison and persuade the Turkish authorities to free her and two other female fighters.

She said the lawyer ‘worked some magic’ after they were arrested near the Turkish border and jailed. 

Umm Khattab, who is now living in the IS-run city of Manbij, northern Syria, with 16-year-old British jihadi twins Salma and Zahra Halane, says she feared she was going to be sent back to Britain.

It is not clear whether the IS lawyer went to court to argue the case or simply made legal representations on behalf of the three women.

In her diary Umm Khattab recounts that when she first arrived in Turkey earlier this year she met two other European female jiahdis. But when they tried to cross the border into Syria they were all arrested and imprisoned by the ‘Turkish military’ on suspicion of being members of IS.

Umm Khattab, who married a Swedish jihadi recently killed in Kobane, says on her Tumblr blog: ‘We tried to act like Syrians but they made us lift our niqab up and they knew we weren’t Syrians. So the T [Turkish] military men took us to their base and were questioning us whether we were with “Daesha” [IS].

‘We completely denied all claims and said we were aid workers lol.’

The Turkish authorities were so concerned about the women that the next day they booked them on return flights to their home countries.

Umm Khattab recounts: ‘Me and the sister’s [sic] were just annoyed cause we were being sent back to Dar al-Kufr [land of non-believers].

‘So Dawlah (IS) found out about our predicament and sent us a lawyer who worked some magic and after a looooong tiring week in prison they let us go, Alhamdulillah [all praise to God].’

While jihadis waging war in the Middle East are vocal in their hatred of Western society, those from Britain are greedily devouring Western products like Nutella and Red Bull on the frontline, it has emerged.

Bounty and Snickers bars, energy drinks and non-alcoholic beer are among top treats for foreigners fighting for Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq.

It has been estimated that between 500 and 2,000 Brits have joined thousands of other foreigners fighting for the group. 

But despite IS rejecting ideals of civilised states, its fighters are happy to lap up the West’s goods, including junk food and other gadgets, such as the latest iPhones.

One shopkeeper based in the central Syrian city of Raqqa, told the Financial Times: ‘These snacks were either unknown, or luxuries we couldn’t afford.

‘But when the fighters requested them, I didn’t ask questions. I ran to my supplier and placed an order.'

After the IS lawyer had secured their release, the three women and their five children – all under the age of five – made a second attempt to cross the border, but were stopped and imprisoned again. 

This time one of Umm Khattab’s two friends used the guard’s mobile phone to contact her husband, an IS fighter, and after he spoke to the officials, they were all released.

Umm Khattab adds: ‘Then we went outside and there was a car outside for us but I still was very paranoid, so we went in the car and inside was the man who had interrogated us.

‘So this guy drives... to another boarder [sic] controlled by Dawlah and we didn’t even have to run across. They opened the gates for us and we entered shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam by the will of Allah.’

Although the case cannot be verified as Umm Khattab has chosen not to reveal her true identity, it shows how far IS is able to infiltrate Turkey’s border security to bring fighters and their families into Syria.
