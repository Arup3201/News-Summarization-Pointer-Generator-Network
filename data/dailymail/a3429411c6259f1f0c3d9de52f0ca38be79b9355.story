A  homeless man was found dead on the steps of a New York record store  after people stepping over him realized he wasn't moving, witnesses have claimed.

Police were called to the entrance of Westsider Records on the Upper West Side where the body of a Hispanic man was found lying face down yesterday morning.

Shocked witnesses claim they saw people  walking around the  man as he lay dead on the steps of the record store- next door to a funeral home.

The man was discovered dead at the entrance to Westsider Records, in the Upper West Side, New York, by people who had been walking over him

The man was described as wearing worn out sneakers with no laces that were held together by several socks. Officers found no identification and are now checking to see the man is homeless.

An autopsy will be carried out to confirm the cause of death but a homeless advocate warned Monday night's freezing temperatures could have been to blame.

Record store manager Bruce Edar, 59, told New York Daily News said no one should have had to have been outside during the frigid weather.

'It's horrible, a night like last night,' he said. 'Anyone in that condition should had been picked up and put in a shelter.'

One upset customer at the shop said she was 'shocked' people were walking around the dead man as he lay at the entrance to the shop, while another witnesses said she believed he had been there for some time.

Hannibal Perez, 53, who works at the National Council of Jewish Women near the store, added that he walked by the man without realizing he was dead.

'He was laying on the steps, face down,' he said. 'He had a heavy jacket, waist length. The guy wasn't moving at all.' 

The Department of Homeless Services, DHS, has a 'Code Blue' protocols in place to protect the homeless on nights that fall below freezing point (0 degrees Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit).

DHS has confirmed it is looking into the death and said offered a place for anyone who wanted to come in from the  cold.
