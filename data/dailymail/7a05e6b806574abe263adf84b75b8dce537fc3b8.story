Britain's house price boom is gathering pace with some areas seeing the cost of a home rise by almost a quarter in 2013, MailOnline can reveal today.

In the past 12 months buyers have been scrambling to buy properties, particularly in London and the south-east, because there has been an 'insufficient rise' in new homes, driving up the cost of a flat or house by more than £1million in some cases.

On average, house prices in the UK were up seven per cent this year, adding around £14,000 to the average property, which now costs £171,000.

This will go up another eight per cent by the end of 2014 and up to 30 per cent by 2013, experts say.

A new interactive map produced by experts from Savills, exclusively for MailOnline, also reveals that house prices in prime spots are now almost double what they were at the start of the 2008 crash.

What has happened to prime property prices over the last 5 years? This map is from Savills. View the full version here.

In
 London the increases have been highest, with Fulham and Battersea, 
known as 'nappy valley', up around 23 per cent in the past 12 months. Average houses in prime areas like these are close to the £2million barrier for the first time.

Areas outside the capital, like Reigate, Winchester, Farnham and Oxford, have seen the biggest rises, with the cost of a home now between nine per cent and 15 per cent higher than a year ago.

But experts insisted today that there no 'bubble'.

Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, said: 'The simple mechanics of supply and demand have driven this price growth.

'Greater numbers of affluent families have remained in London, putting pressure on a limited pool of housing stock in certain areas.

'Those priced out are looking to emerging prime markets, while other have begun to re-look at the prime suburbs and commuter towns.'

But there have been some losers this 
year, with prices down almost entirely across the board in Scotland in 
2013, with little or no growth in Wales, the Midlands and the North of 
England.

Big rise: Battersea and Fulham had the biggest price increases in the past year, up around 23 per cent, which will add huge sums to many properties

Picture of Britain: House prices in some areas have now risen beyond the 2008 peak, before the crash, and are expected to go up across the board in the next five years

Trends: Savills predicts that next year there will be a rise in prime properties, followed by a lull in 2015, before more sustained growth on homes worth in excess of £800,000 today

The house price boom is predicted to last for another five years meaning the average cost of a home will jump by £43,000.

Buoyant: House prices will rise by up to eight per cent next year to build on strong gains this year, according to a forecast from Halifax

Prices in some areas will rocket by a third by 2018, according to Savills, fuelling a growing gap between homeowners and those who cannot afford to buy.

The property seller forecasts the average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in the next five years – from £171,000 to £214,000.

The news has coincided with annual figures released by the Halifax.

It said further economic recovery and continued low interest rates would support a broadly similar increase to this year, which has already seen prices go up seven per cent in the first 11 months of this year.

But a price surge in London, which has seen the steepest rises, is expected to slow down, the bank added.

The forecast comes in the wake of a warning from Business Secretary Vince Cable that the Government might need to review its flagship Help to Buy programme amid what he called a 'raging housing boom' in the capital and the South East.

Halifax’s housing economist, Martin Ellis said: 'The housing market has been stronger than expected during 2013. Higher demand, combined with an insufficient rise in housing supply, has resulted in increases in house prices and higher activity this year. Low interest rates, and higher consumer confidence due to the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be underway, are helping to stimulate housing demand. Schemes, such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, also appear to have boosted demand.

'Nationally, house prices have increased by seven per cent in the first 11 months of the year. Activity has also picked up with transactions likely to exceed one million for the first time since 2007'.
