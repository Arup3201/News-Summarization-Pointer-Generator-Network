Winger Silvestre Varela has undergone a minor groin operation and is expected to return to training with West Brom next week.

Varela, who joined Albion on a season-long loan deal from Porto over the summer, has so far made only one appearance for the Baggies, as a substitute in the Capital One Cup.

The 29-year-old Portugal international went under the knife following consultation between West Brom and his parent club.

'Porto are happy and comfortable with it.

'We hope Silvestre will join us for training some time next week.'
