The final survivor of the elite Bletchley Park codebreaking team that cracked Adolf Hitler's secret messages during the Second World War has died aged 93.

Raymond 'Jerry' Roberts - who helped crack the system carrying messages between Hitler and his top generals – died at his home in Liphook, Hampshire on Tuesday following a short illness.

Captain Roberts was the last remaining founder member of a team which cracked the German High Command’s Tunny code, and in doing so shortened the Second World War by at least two years.

The German Tunny system was used by Hitler, Mussolini and other high ranking generals during the Second World War, and was made up of four times as many encryption wheels as the famous Enigma machine.

Last year, to mark the significance of Captain Robert’s work, he received an MBE and a set of commemorative stamps issued in his name.

He told the BBC: ‘This was intelligence gold dust, really top level stuff. [We cracked the] movements of troops, not just divisions or regiments but of [whole] armies.’

He also described seeing the messages between Hitler and his generals and says a landmark moment in his career was 'seeing the signature come up - of 'Adolf, spacer, Hitler, spacer, fuhrer, spacer'.'

'A very simple signature; I imagine the person who received the signature stood up and saluted.'

Capt Roberts joined Bletchley Park as a cryptographer and linguist in 1941 and was one of four founder members of the Testery, an elite unit named after the man leading it, Ralph Tester, which cracked the Tunny code - making it possible to read Hitler's messages during the war.

The Testery team, which grew to 118 by the end of the war, managed to reverse-engineer the Tunny, which had 12 encryption wheels to the Enigma machine's three, described by Bletchley Park as 'an incredible feat of dedication'.

The spokeswoman said: 'Jerry came to Bletchley Park straight from university but they were all in unchartered territory. It was new ground for everybody.'

The intelligence gathered at Bletchley Park is credited with providing strategic information that was passing between the top level commanders and is believed to have shortened the war by two years and helped to save millions of lives.

Captain Roberts worked at Bletchley Park until 1945 before moving to the War Crimes Investigation Unit for two years, followed by a 50-year career in marketing and research.

Later in life he became a tireless ambassador 
for the memory of those who had served in secret, and spent years 
campaigning for acknowledgement of his colleagues, including Alan 
Turing, who broke the naval Enigma.

He argued the Testery as a whole should be honoured for its work - including Bill Tutte who broke the Tunny system to help shorten the war; and Tommy Flowers, who designed and built the Colossus, which sped up some stages of the breaking of Tunny traffic.

Their stream of intelligence proved vital in the D-Day invasion and helped save many lives.

The codebreaker, originally from Liphook in Hampshire, worked at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, until the end of the Second World War before spending two years at the War Crimes Investigation Unit, and then moved on to a 50-year career in marketing and research.

The intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of Buckinghamshire was to be decisive in the Allied effort to win the Second World War.

Station X - known now as Bletchley Park - was the hub of Britain's code-backing effort, where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping-hand.

As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle.

Codenamed Ultra the intelligence provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort.

Sir Harry Hinsley, a Bletchley veteran and the official historian of British Intelligence during the Second World War, said that Ultra shortened the war by two to four years and that the outcome of the war would have been uncertain without it.

Captain Roberts was one of the four founder members of the Testery in October 1941, along with team leader Ralph Tester, Major Denis Oswald and Captain Peter Ericsson.

After a few months of breaking of a Double Playfair cipher system used by the German Military Police, the unit was tasked with breaking the German High Command’s most top-level code Tunny.

Despite being Adolf Hitler’s most secret code system and having 12 wheels against well-known 3 wheel Enigma, tens of thousands of Tunny messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park.

By the end of the War, the Testery had grown to 9 cryptanalysts, a team of 24 ATS, a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.
