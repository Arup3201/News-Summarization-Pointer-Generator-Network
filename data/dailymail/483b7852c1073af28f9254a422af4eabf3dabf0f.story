Two young brothers have been swept 50 ft to their deaths by an avalanche while on a snowmobiling trip with their family near their Utah home.

The parents and sisters of 14-year-old Coleman Sweat and seven-year-old Trevan Sweat watched in horror as the snow beneath the youngsters' feet gave way as they stopped to take in the view.

The boys were swept down the hillside in Wasatch County and buried under two feet of snow. When their family found them 30 minutes later, they were unconscious and could not be revived.

The tragedy occurred when the Sweat family - experienced snowmobile riders who were well prepared for the trip - were snowmobiling in Duchesne on Friday afternoon and stopped to rest.

Coleman and Trevan went to look over a ledge when it gave way, police told Fox 13.

'They parked on the road and then they just walked 50 feet from their 
snowmobiles,' Jared Rigby, Wasatch County Sheriff Chief Deputy, said. 'The cornice gave way and they fell.'

Deputies said the boys could not have known they would trigger a snow slide, and conditions in the area were considered moderate for 
avalanche danger, Fox 13 reported.

'They weren’t really in what you would consider classic avalanche 
terrain,' Utah Avalanche Center Forecaster Craig Gordon said. 'It was 
just a steep little wind loaded bowl.'

After the boys were swept away, their parents, Jason and Janette 
Sweat, called for help and looked for their sons as their daughters, Kylee and Jaylee, waited for authorities to arrive.

The boys were unconscious and not 
breathing when they were found. They were airlifted to Primary Children's Medical Center, but could not be saved.

On Monday, nearly 200 family and friends fathered at Rocky Mountain Middle School, where Coleman was a student, to remember the boys.

Missed: The boys' father Jason Sweat attended a vigil for his sons and called Trevan 'my little shadow'

'It means a lot to see the support of 
the community, friends and family that rallied around my two boys in a 
bad situation like this,' their father, Jason Sweat, said at the memorial.

'We're 
always told that people are on the other side and they need good young 
men to carry out things and my boys certainly fit that description.'

He said his eldest son loved to be outdoors to hunt, fish and camp, and especially enjoyed snowmobiling.

He called Trevan 'my little shadow'.

Outpouring: Hundreds of friends and family attended a memorial for the boys at Coleman's school

'When I was working on stuff in the garage 
late at night, Trevan was always right there with me,' he said. 'I'm glad for 
the time I got to spend with Trevan. He had a heart that was incredible.'

Deputies said the entire community was shaken by the loss of the two young boys.

'One of the search and rescue members told me for him this was the call 
he'd been dreading for 20 years,' Rigby said. 'To know the family, to know that they’re children, And to 
have very little you can do about it.'

Memorial funds have been set up at Wells Fargo Bank and Utah Community 
Credit Union to help the Sweat family with expenses under the name 
Coleman and Trevan Sweat Memorial Fund.
