MPs have rejected proposals to ban abortions on the grounds of gender amid claims it would make it harder for women from Muslim communities to seek help.

The change, in an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, was last night defeated by 291 votes to 201.

The proposed ban was tabled by Tory MP Fiona Bruce but was dealt a major blow when shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper wrote to Labour MPs urging them to vote against it.

Miss Cooper said that to support the change would make ‘vulnerable women’ less likely to have ‘open and honest conversations’ with doctors and nurses.

David Cameron also said it could stop women being able to ‘avoid the certainty of genetic disease’.

Last night’s vote centred on plans to make it crystal clear that sex-selective terminations are illegal. Critics insist that the existing legislation on the issue is confusing and that terminations based on the sex of the foetus are still going on in some communities.

More than 100 MPs have put their name to the amendment tabled by Mrs Bruce, who said it was needed ‘to stop women being misled, to send a strong signal, and to provide an opportunity for Government help’.

But Miss Cooper claimed the move would make it impossible to terminate a child suffering from sex-specific abnormalities.

In her letter to Labour MPs, she wrote: ‘Concerns have been raised that some women are put under intense pressure by their partners, families or communities to deliver male children.’

She added: ‘Fiona Bruce’s amendment will do little to alleviate the external pressures or coercion these women face, nor eradicate prejudices, customs and traditions which are based on the idea of the inferiority of women and which may amount to pressure to seek an abortion because of the sex of a foetus.

‘Some organisations have raised concern that Bruce’s amendment would simply make vulnerable women less likely to have open and honest conversations with healthcare professionals about their circumstances, making it harder to get them support.’

Tory MP Fiona Bruce has tabled an amendment which will clarify the law on gender-selective abortion

Miss Cooper instead called on Labour MPs to support a rival amendment which called for a thorough assessment of the evidence on sex-selective abortion, together with a new government plan to promote cultural change. At a Tory rally in Hastings, Mr Cameron said he supported the ‘status quo’ whereby abortion on gender grounds is not legal but could be allowed in some cases.

‘Now, there are very few circumstances, for example avoiding the certainty of genetic disease, that it might be allowed, so I support that,’ he said.

‘But in doing so, I hope that the abortion rules are properly policed and prosecutions and all the rest of it are carried out when the laws are broken.’

Miss Bruce’s amendment to the Serious Crime Bill attempted to make sure that nothing in the Abortion Act ‘is to be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child’. It would have meant that women who have abortions in these circumstances and the doctors who approve them could be liable for criminal prosecution.

Last night Rani Bilkhu, director of Jeena International – which campaigns against sex-selective abortions – called the vote a ‘disgrace’.

‘This is an insult to the women we work with who have suffered under the burden of sex-selective abortion and have said they want clarity in the law,’ she said.

‘To think that a few Westminster bubble MPs could scupper such an important vote mocks the very fabric of British democracy. It is a disgrace.’
