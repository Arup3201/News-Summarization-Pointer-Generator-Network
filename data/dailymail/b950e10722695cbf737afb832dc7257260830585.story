So, Germany are on the verge of winning the World Cup and England didn’t progress beyond the group stage. It’s not great, is it?

Especially when you think that England beat Germany 5-1 in 2001.

I was in the team so I remember it well — Michael Owen’s hat-trick and the team coming together to play slick and clinical football.

Oops: The historic 5-1 win in 2001 seems a long time ago from the current German outfit

Remember that? The back and front page of the Mail on Sunday led on England's 5-1 thrashing of Germany

The Germans remember it well, too, because they used that defeat to inspire a transformation that would lead to them becoming one of the greatest sides in the world.

They didn’t blame the players for losing, they realised that the system was wrong and they changed the system.

We need to do the same thing. We have to stop blaming players like Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard... there was talk about how they had lost heart, they hadn’t given enough for their country.

I promise you, this is absolute rubbish. When a player pulls on an England shirt he will do anything to win for his country. But there comes a time when it needs more than heart… it needs a proper structure that enables them to be the greatest team they can.

Germany provided that structure and look what has happened.

Implosion: Brazil's Marcelo cuts a lonely figure as Germany run riot in the semi final to put their 5-1 loss firmly behind

After that defeat 13 years ago, they ripped up the coaching manual and started again. They worked out what needed to be changed and they changed it. This is what Germany did:

Room for improvement: Roy Hodgson must rip up the coaching manual and start again as Germany did

Looking ahead: The FA want England fans to enjoy success at Euro 2016 after a dismal World Cup

On the up: England must look at how Germany responded in 2001 and work on improving themselves

There’s no doubt we could do everything Germany did and more, so as you watch the final on Sunday evening, just think: if the FA choose to learn the lessons of this World Cup, it will be England who we are watching in the final in future, not Germany.

Glum: England must take responsibility for youth development as Germany did after the 5-1 humiliation

Difference: England can make the World Cup final in the future but the FA must learn from this tournament

England beat Germany 5-1 in 2001 - they used that defeat to transform

@highlight

Roy Hodgson, England and the FA must do the same after 2014 World Cup

@highlight

Germany have 34,970 UEFA (Pro, A or B) licensed coaches compared to just 2,769 in England

@highlight

We need to get our priorities straight - the game starts at grassroots

@highlight

Youth development needs looking at because the national team is suffering

@highlight

Do this, and we'll be in the World Cup final in the future like Germany are

@highlight

They introduced more and better coaching. Ten years on from that 2001 defeat, England had 2,769 UEFA (Pro, A or B) licensed coaches compared to 34,970 in Germany. England need more coaches and more highly-qualified coaches working at all levels of the game.

@highlight

They made sure there was more game time for young players. Young players in German academies have roughly five times the game time that those in English academies have. The grass-roots game is where footballing greatness starts. We have to get our youth football right.

@highlight

They made sure there was a clearly defined route between the grassroots and the national game, so that good players were fast-tracked into the senior set-up. We need to make sure this is happening in England, too. A proper structure means we keep talented players in the game.

@highlight

They made sure they took responsibility for youth development and the future of the Germany team. It feels as if that task has been handed to club academies and centres of excellence in this country, which means there is not an England development programme but club development programmes. This is fine but it means the importance of winning games at a young age comes at the expense of developing technique and it means that if the clubs get it wrong, the England team suffer. The FA need to take more control.

@highlight

In Germany they sorted out what their footballing philosophy was. They were clear about what they wanted from players and how to achieve it. There needs to be an FA philosophy on how to develop players. What is the FA’s philosophy on the game? Most people think that a more technical, possession-based game has been lacking in English football. Are the FA addressing this? What is being done? The FA need to instill a football intelligence in young players and this needs to be reflected in every side from the first team to the Under 16s, so the players understand the England way of playing.
