England forward Lee Mossop has cut short his injury-hit stint in the NRL to rejoin Wigan.

The 25-year-old prop left the Warriors after their Grand Final win over Warrington 12 months ago and joined Parramatta on a two-year contract, with an option for a third season with the Sydney club.

However, he was sidelined for the first three months of the season with a shoulder injury and missed the end of it after undergoing surgery on the problem for a second time.

Lee Mossop (pictured winning the Challenge Cup final in 2013) has re-signed for Wigan Warriors 

Now he is back with the Warriors, having signed a three-year deal, with the option of a fourth in the club's favour, although chairman Ian Lenagan says they have inserted a clause in his contract in case the player fails to make a full recovery from his latest operation.

Mossop, who becomes the second England international to rejoin Wigan in the last six months following Joel Tomkins' return from rugby union, said: 'I have enjoyed my time with Parramatta but I felt it was the right time to return to the UK.

'Wigan was always going to be my first choice and I am really happy that we have been able to agree a deal.

'I owe a lot to this club having come through the youth system. The squad is a bit younger now and I hope to be able to pass on my experience to some of the other players. I was at the Grand Final last month cheering the boys on and hope to be back there again next season.'

Mossop, who made 111 appearances in his first spell with the club, was wanted by Leeds, who are looking to bolster their front row after releasing Ryan Bailey and Ian Kirke in recent weeks, but Wigan had first option on him.

They will need to release players to make room for Mossop under their salary cap and it is thought Scott Taylor and possibly Gil Dudson could now be moved on.

Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: 'As soon as I heard that he might be available, I asked (rugby manager) Kris Radlinski and Ian Lenagan to see if it was possible and I am grateful that they have done just that.

'I am pleased also for Lee showing loyalty to the club. Having seen the fans welcome Joel Tomkins back earlier this year, I am looking forward to seeing them give Lee a great reception at the DW next season.'

Wigan say Mossop will miss the start of the new season but is expected to recover from his latest shoulder operation in time to make his return in late February.

Lenagan said: 'We are aware that Lee has had issues with his shoulders in the past which did not resolve with keyhole surgery but he has now had advanced surgery to put them right and our medical specialist advise that statistics have proven the surgery to work in 97 per cent of shoulder cases.

'As is the case in instances like this, we have put provisions in Lee's contract to protect the club against recurrence.

'We all know that a fit Lee Mossop is one of the best front rowers in the game and I have confidence in my coaching staff to bring the best out of him again and, hopefully, even more with his shoulder problems fixed.

'Lee had a lot of interest from rival clubs but preferred to be back at Wigan.

'This is another positive for Wigan and for rugby league in this country and serves only to vindicate our policy of allowing players to play in other competitions whilst keeping the option available for them to return to the club in the future.

'With this deal, there will now be a few consequential changes to our squad for the 2015 season to follow.'
