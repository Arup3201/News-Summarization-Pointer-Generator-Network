The Iowa father who was stopped for speeding while his wife gave birth in the passenger seat of their car admitted that he ignored police until forced to pull over by traffic and a red light.

Tyler Rathjen was frantically driving to hospital last Sunday as Ashley Rathjen delivered their son beside him and Iowa City Police were flashing their lights behind their SUV.

The man recalled to KCRG.com that he thought: 'I should stop but I’m not going to, I’m going to get to the hospital.' When he was made to pull over, Iowa City police officer Kevin Wolfe was immediately required to act as a maternity nurse.

Panicked Tyler jumped out of the vehicle and yelled: 'Sir, we're delivering a baby right here, right now!'

Wolfe said that by the time he reached the passenger door of the couple's black SUV, the baby's head and arms were already out.

'We were all having a different experience,' the officer told KCRG. 

While the officer was preparing to stop a speeding driver, Tyler was ready to explain his actions to police.

In the meantime, Ashley Rathjen had given birth with no medical attention at the side of a road.

Ashley remembered: 'I kept saying: there’s no break (in contractions) there’s no break. He was coming at that time.'

Thankfully for Ashley, the delivery was definitely quick and, in the circumstances, relatively easy.

The couple, both of Williamsburg, had made it to within two blocks of Mercy Iowa City hospital when their baby boy, Owen, appeared into the world for the first time.

Owen was born at seven pounds, 12 ounces soon, after 10 pm on March 10.

Wolfe, a six-year police force veteran, 
assisted in the final stages of the delivery and wrapped the child in a 
blanket. He then escorted the family to hospital.

Police spokeswoman Vicki Lalla says he didn't end up issuing a speeding ticket and did not take down the parents' names.

As reported by KCRG, Owen, his parents and his two older brothers are all doing well at home.

'I'm sure it will be a life story to tell everybody [about] how he made his grand entrance,' Ashley said.

Father: The driver of the SUV, pictured, told the police officer 'Sir, we're delivering a baby right here, right now'

Wolfe, whose dashboard camera captured 
the incredible episode, said he had not expected a baby to be born right
there on the roadside.

'I had every expectation that when they said they were having a baby they meant there was a baby on the way and we would drive to the hospital and I would shake their hand and say "good luck."' he said.

The baby can be heard crying on the police tape. The shocked, and hardworking, mother repeatedly yells 'Oh my God' as her little one is born with only a few pushes.

Radio: Wolfe, pictured in his dash camera video, radioed in the bizarre occurrence to the station

Final stages: The police officer, pictured, said the baby's head and arms were already out but he helped in the final stages

'Congratulations, this my first one on the road so,' Wolfe can be heard telling the couple.

Later he told KCRG.com: 'I think everybody was equally surprised. I'd say it's pretty crazy, this one I'll be telling for a while.'
