Large numbers of News Corp shareholders have registered their anger over the phone-hacking scandal by opposing the re-election of James and Lachlan Murdoch to the board of directors.

Most shareholders not affiliated with the family are against having one of Rupert Murdoch's children taking control of the company when he steps down, results from last week's annual meeting suggest.

Around 35 per cent voted against James Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corp. International, and 34 per cent voted against Lachlan.

Another 14 per cent of shareholder votes were cast against 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch, who founded the company with a single newspaper in Australia in 1952 and grew it into a media behemoth that owns The Wall Street Journal, Fox News and the 20th Century Fox film studio.

Tom Watson, a Labour MP who attended the meeting in Los Angeles, said yesterday: 'This is the autumn of the patriarch.

'The investors have chosen to send a signal that this company needs to be run on proper lines rather than like a family firm.'

The votes against his two sons represent more than half of the cast ballots outside the control of either the Murdoch family trust - which has about 38 per cent of the outstanding shares - or the family's key backer, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who has 7 per cent.

James Murdoch is to give evidence for a second time to a parliamentary investigation into phone-hacking on November 10.

He will face fresh questions about the hacking scandal which has consumed News International for months.

At an appearance before the cross-party Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, he and his father Rupert repeatedly rebutted suggestions of personal wrongdoing in relation to the hacking scandal.

It is understood that the committee is unsatisfied with some of Mr Murdoch's answers and he has been recalled to explain himself further.

The announcement came after Mr Murdoch's predecessor Les Hinton was grilled by video-link

Mr Hinton, the most senior casualty of the hacking scandal so far, told MPs there was 'no reason' why Mr Murdoch should resign from his post at News International (NI).

A close lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch who had worked with the News Corp chief for more than 50 years, Mr Hinton quit as CEO of the company's Dow Jones subsidiary in July as the scale of hacking which took place under his watch at NI-owned News of the World became apparent.

Mr Hinton acknowledged that some of the evidence previously given to the committee by NI executives, when they insisted that hacking at the Sunday tabloid was limited to a single rogue reporter, had turned out to be 'not accurate'.

But he challenged MPs' suggestions that this meant executives had been 'untruthful', insisting that events had become clear only over the past couple of years and the full picture of what happened was still not known.

And he told them: 'I see no reason why James Murdoch should resign.'

Ballots representing about 17 per cent of the company's voting shares were not cast.

News Corp has come under fire following 
revelations of widespread phone-hacking at its British tabloid, the News
of the World, including the mobile phone of missing 13-year-old
girl Milly Dowler being targeted.

A private investigator hired by the paper deleted Milly's voicemails, giving the family and police false hope 
that she was alive, though she was later found murdered.

The company is also being investigated on allegations of police bribery and computer hacking.

The scandal also forced the resignation of two of London's top police officers, ousted top executives such as Dow Jones & Co chief executive Les Hinton and claimed the job of Prime Minister David Cameron's former spokesman, Andy Coulson - an ex-News of the World editor.

Under the weight of criticism, News Corp closed the tabloid and dropped its $12billion bid for full control of British Sky Broadcasting.

Shareholders did show support for executives charged with cleaning up the scandal.

Around 96 per cent backed Joel Klein, a former U.S. assistant attorney general who became a company executive in July and who is directing the company's internal investigation.

Nearly 99 per cent backed new board member James Breyer, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who also serves on the boards of Facebook, Dell Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Several corporate governance experts have criticized News Corp.'s two classes of shares - voting and non-voting - which allow the Murdoch family to control the company even though their voting shares account for less than 15 percent of the company's total $44 billion market value.

News Corp.'s shares rose 20 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to close at $17.40 yesterday. That's still down about 3 per cent since the phone hacking scandal broke in early July.
