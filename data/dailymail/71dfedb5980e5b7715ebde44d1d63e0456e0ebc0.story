These sisters share more than a winning smile.

Grace Simmonds and Scarlett Simmonds have the same birthday and, even more remarkably, the girls were both born on Christmas Day.

Grace stunned her mother Kim and her father Lee when she was born nearly four weeks early on December 25, 2009.

Grace Simmonds, four, stunned her parents when she made her arrival into the world on Christmas Day in 2009 then sister Scarlett was also born on Christmas Day last year

And a few years later, they were told their second daughter was due to be born on December 28.

So imagine their surprise when he sisters beat odds of 133,225 to one to be both born on the same day.

Mother Kim, 30, said: 'Christmas Day is a triple celebration in our house - so its a very busy day indeed.

'We are celebrating Christmas, and Grace and Scarlett's birthdays all on the same day. We can't believe that both our girls were born on Christmas Day - it really is a miracle.'

When Mrs Simmonds fell pregnant with Grace, she was due the second week of January 2010.

She said: 'I'd been given a due date of 13th January and being a first time mum I imagined that she may well be a few weeks late. But I was confident that I would be spending Christmas getting ready for the baby.'

But when Mrs Simmonds, who lives in Leicester with husband Lee, 38, who runs his own security firm, was 12 weeks pregnant, the baby's head was already engaged.

She said: 'The midwife told me that the baby could well come early, and she may even make an appearance at Christmas. I was surprised, but I imagined that it would be after Christmas, perhaps New Year at the earliest.'

Mrs SImmonds went to bed on Christmas Eve but in the early hours of the morning she awoke as her waters broke. Mr Simmonds drove her to hospital where they told her that delivery was still a long way off and to come back on Boxing Day.

She said: 'When I got home I was in a lot of pain and the contractions were getting stronger. But the doctors had told me it would be the following day when I would finally give birth.

'By the middle of the afternoon the pain was so intense I couldn't cope with it anymore and I begged Lee to drive me back to hospital.'

So the couple returned to Leicester General Hospital and less than three hours later, at 6.50pm she gave birth to baby Grace, weighing a healthy 5Ib15.

She said: 'The midwife told me she had always wanted to deliver a Christmas baby. I was still in shock. I couldn't believe I'd delivered her on Christmas Day. She was nearly four weeks early, but luckily she was still healthy.

'I was worried about her being born on Christmas Day but Lee and I both vowed that she wouldn't miss out on attention simply because her birthday was on December 25th.'

When Grace had reached her second birthday, the couple decided to try for another baby.

Mrs Simmonds said: 'We were aiming for a summer baby this time. One Christmas baby was enough for us.'

But in April last year she discovered she was pregnant again - and this time her due date was 28th December.

She said: 'I thought the sonographer was joking when she told us the date. Both Lee and I were so shocked. No-one else could believe it either. All the family and friends were joking that we would have another Christmas Day baby.

'When I told Grace we were having another baby she was so excited. She asked whether it could come on her birthday and be a present for her. I never imagined that she would be getting the present she asked for this year.'

Two weeks before Christmas, Mrs Simmonds started with mild contractions - but doctors told her that they could continue for weeks.

She said: 'I tried to put it to the back of my mind and carry on with the Christmas preparations. I had to hope that this baby would hang on until after Christmas and arrive when she was supposed to do.'

But at nearly midnight on Christmas Eve, her contractions got stronger and in the early hours of Christmas morning, Mrs Simmonds was on her way to Leicester Royal Infirmary.

She said: 'Lee and I just couldn't believe that we were going to hospital for a second time on Christmas Day.'

Baby Scarlett was born at 7.17am - weighing a healthy 6Ib 13oz.

Mrs Simmonds added: 'The midwife was so excited as it was the first Christmas Day baby she had ever delivered. When I told her it was our second, she couldn't believe it. We were the talk of the hospital.'

Now Scarlett is due to celebrate her first birthday and older sister Grace will celebrate her fourth birthday this Christmas Day.

Mrs Simmonds said: I've tried to keep it separate for them this year, and they had their parties a few days before Christmas. We have to do that - or else none of their friends can come. Who wants to come to a birthday party on Christmas Day!

'But the day will be very special. I'm glad my daughters share a birthday.'
