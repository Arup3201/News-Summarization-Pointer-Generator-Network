Al Qaeda has apologised after doctors and patients were slaughtered at a hospital during an attack on a military compound - blaming a rogue gunman for the murders.  

Shocking CCTV footage emerged of an Al Qaeda fighter shooting unarmed hospital staff in the head during an attack on the Defence Ministry compound in Sanaa, Yemen, earlier this month.

In one scene, the gunman can be seen cornering a group inside the compound's hospital building before throwing a grenade directly at them.

Shocking footage: A gunman can be seen running into a military hospital in this CCTV footage released by the Yemen Defence Ministry

No escape: The gunman, who was wearing an army uniform, then throws a grenade into the crowd of hospital staff before running away

Huge blast: One woman runs after the gunman but the others are caught in the blast

Seconds later, sparks can be seen as the grenade explodes. More than 50 people were killed in the attack

The corridor is left shrouded in smoke after the grenade goes off - it is not clear how many people, if any, survived the blast

At least 52 people were killed in the attack which has sparked outrage among both across Yemen and in the international community.

But Al Qaeda's commander of its Yemen wing, Qassim Ar-Reimy, has now condemned the killings and accused a renegade fighter of being responsible.

In a pre-recorded video he said: 'We confess to this mistake and fault, we offer our apologies and condolence to the families of the victims'.

Targeted: Hospital staff gather by the hospital entrance as an Al Qaeda fighter drives a car packed with explosives into the gate of the ministry's compound

Explosion: The Al Qaeda militants set off explosives to blow the gate and enter the compound

He goes on to claim that the focus of the attack had always been the Ministry and not the hospital.

He said: 'We did not target them on purpose, this is not of our religion or our morals, we accept full responsibility for what happened in the hospital.

'The attack was on the Ministry of Defence, it was not on the Hospital.

'The ministry's hospitals are 
abundant in the country. If we wanted to attack (the hospitals) we would
 have - especially as they have no noteworthy security.

On the hunt: The Al Qaeda fighter enters the hospital and goes in search of his victims

A hospital staff member staggers through a ward moments before he collapses to the ground - apparently shot from behind

Renegade: Seconds later the gunman can be seen holding his weapon up as he stalks through the hospital corridor, shooting anyone he comes into contact with

'We attacked the Ministry. The Ministry of Defence Command Center to be precise.'

The killing of unarmed medics and patients, captured on closed-circuit television footage and broadcast by state media, caused widespread outrage in Yemen, where al Qaeda has portrayed itself as fighting for normal people against foreign drone strikes.

Al Qaeda's offshoot Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law) claimed responsibility earlier this month for the December 5 assault - the worst attack in Yemen for 18 months.

Two men are shown on CCTV standing in a doorway of the hospital moments before they are shot down

Brutal: The gunman can be seen standing over the bodies of the two men in the doorway

Casualties: At least 52 people were killed in the attack - many inside the hospital building - and many more were injured

Victims: Paramedics load a victim into an ambulance after an explosion at the Defence Ministry complex in Sanaa, Yemen

It said it attacked the compound because it believed it to house an operations room for drone attacks carried out by the United States against Islamist militants, which have also led to civilian deaths.

Many of those killed died inside the compound's hospital, where staff said they had seen foreign doctors and nurses executed by attackers.

The footage released on state television showed uniformed figures wandering around the hospital's corridors, shooting medics and patients.

One attacker was shown walking up to a group of cowering patients and calmly tossing a hand grenade into their midst before ducking behind a wall. 

Apology: Commander of Al Qaeda's Yemen wing, Qassim Ar-Reimy apologised for the murders of unarmed hospital staff and patients

Blame: He claimed all fighters had been told not to go near the hospital and a rogue gunman was responsible for the killings
