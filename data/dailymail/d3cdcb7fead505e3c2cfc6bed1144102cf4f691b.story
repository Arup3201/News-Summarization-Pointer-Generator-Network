Japan has a new mascot - in the shape of a newly-formed volcanic island in the likeness of cartoon dog Snoopy.

The island, off the country's Pacific coast, rose from the sea over the past few weeks as a massive undersea volcano erupted and spewed out magma which cooled to create the new land mass.

By Christmas Eve, the island 620 miles south of Tokyo had expanded and it has now linked with existing Nishinoshima island.

Spot the difference: The island bears an uncanny resemblance to Snoopy

After aerial photographs of the two islands were released, Twitter users pointed out how much they resembled Charlie Brown's faithful companion.

The likeness to Charles M. Schulz's creation is realised even further as a pool of reddish seawater, in between the two islands, looks like Snoopy's collar.

The Guardian reports experts say the volcano is still active and there is the possibility it will continue to change shape as the magma continues to rise.

The long-term future of the island is unclear and there has been specualtion over whether China will claim the island.

At the moment, it is part of the Ogasawara chain.

The Canaries could soon be getting a new island too.

A series of earthquakes and trembles that have struck in the Atlantic Ocean in the past week suggest that an underwater volcano is about to blow.

The largest of these quakes reached a magnitude of 5.1 off the coast of El Hierro - the smallest island in the Canaries - and the island is said to have swelled by three inches.

If the volcano was to erupt, the force could push masses of molten rock to the surface and could subsequently create a new island or islet in the Canary chain.

It would also mean all 10,000 residents on the 107 square mile stretch of land would need to be evacuated.

El Hierro itself was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high.
