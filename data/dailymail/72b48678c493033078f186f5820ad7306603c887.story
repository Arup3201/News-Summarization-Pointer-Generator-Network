A teenage girl has been caught on video violently beating another schoolgirl in front of a jeering crowd in broad daylight in Geelong, in

The blue-haired girl can be seen at the start of the video antagonising the victim, sitting on top of her and playing up for the number of camera phones pointed at their faces.  

'You're keen for a punch-up?' the attacker asks as the victim stays silent for the whole video, with her hands in her pockets.

'See all these phones recording, that's nothing to be proud of,' the blue-haired girl says as she stares straight at her victim. 

As the crowd of hyped up teens begin to grow bored of the situation, the blue-haired girl springs to her feet and grabs a takeaway cup from a friend, threatening to pour it's contents over the victim's hair.

The girl behind the camera eggs the attacker on, saying 'I just want to see a punch-on, that's all I want to see right now.'

As the victim smashes the takeaway cup of soft drink out of the attacker's hand, another girl pushes the victim, shouting abuse at her for spilling her drink.

'This is going straight on Facebook' a boy says as he gleefully catches the whole thing on his phone. 

The blue-haired girl doesn't hold back as she lays seven punches into her victim's head and pushes her straight into a pole, dragging her to the ground by her hair.

As the victim falls to the ground she continues to punch her, kicking her straight in the face and laughing at the cameras.  

Cries of 'punch her back' come from the waiting crowd as the bloodied victim insists that she can't.

'Just the smell of her makes you want to vomit', the blue-haired girl viciously roars as the group of teens laugh and seem genuinely pleased at the events unfolding before them. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, a Victoria Police spokesperson said that the police are aware of the video and are investigating.
