Climbing the ladder: Couples are unable to move into a bigger second home because of rising prices

Growing numbers of homeowners are ‘trapped’ in small first homes as they struggle to take the second step up the property ladder.

Thousands who bought their first home at the peak of the market can’t afford to up-size, say experts.

A study by Lloyds Bank found homeowners must now raise almost £60,000 to take their next step.

The report showed the average household looking to move estimated their current home was worth £223,600 – but the price for the next house they wanted was £282,000.

It means these ‘second steppers’ must find an extra £58,400 to move house – double the amount of the average first-time buyer deposit of £25,848 – showing it is more expensive to move up the ladder than to get on it.

A third said stamp duty was a key challenge in moving house.

The Government has faced fierce criticism for failing to raise stamp duty tax thresholds in line with soaring house prices. 

Buyers must now pay more than £8,000 in stamp duty on an average UK property worth £274,000, or more than £20,000 on an average London home at £514,000.

The report warns: ‘Second Steppers are living in the homes that the first time buyers need to buy to keep the market moving.

‘Without movement from Second Steppers, movement on the ladder comes to a standstill on the second rung.’

The gap is £15,000 more than last year as house prices, especially sought-after detached homes, soar out of reach.

Many first-time buyers who bought their first home during the 2007-08 property surge have only recently come out of negative equity and now face a desperate struggle to raise the extra capital to move into a larger home.  

Almost half of those questioned by Lloyds said costs and fees associated with moving house was the biggest barrier to moving up the ladder.

Paula Higgins, of the HomeOwners Alliance, said: ‘Second-steppers are being dealt with multiple blows – those who bought at the last peak with a small deposit may not have seen their equity grow, so may still be pushing to their borrowing to the maximum.

Many people look to move on from their first home after six or seven years, so those who bought in 2007-08 at the last peak will now be trying to move.

The report warns: ‘Second Steppers are living in homes the first time buyers need to keep the market moving'

‘But homeowners also face the prohibitive cost of moving, made worse by massive stamp duty bills.

‘They would have to pay £9,000 on a £300,000 property, for example.

‘This is also against the backdrop of not building enough new houses for years and years, which has pushed up prices beyond many people’s reach.’

Mrs Higgins added that others were struggling to pass new tougher mortgage tests, which meant they were stuck in their first home.

Under the Mortgage Market Review introduced in April, lenders must ask probing questions about borrowers’ spending habits to determine whether they can afford the repayments in the event of interest rate rises.

Housing Minister Brandon Lewis: ‘There are clear benefits to helping second steppers move up'

She said: ‘The MMR hasn’t helped second-steppers, who are often young families, in that the affordability tests now take into account sky high childcare costs.’

The struggle to up-size has left many people raising families in cramped flats and terraced houses, or forced to turn to government initiatives.

Official figures show rising numbers of second steppers have turned to the Government’s Help to Buy scheme – originally intended for first-time buyers.

‘Home-movers’ using the ‘equity loan’ initiative soared from eight per cent to 15 per cent of all people in the last year, while the rest were first-time buyers.

Under the equity loan scheme launched in 2013, buyers can purchase a new-build property worth up to £600,000 with a small deposit.

Also known as Help to Buy 1, in return for a five per cent deposit, the government will lend them up to 20 per cent through an interest free loan.

This allows them to gain mortgage for the remaining 75 per cent of the house. After five years, the loan is charged at an interest rate of 1.75 per cent, which rises every year by one per cent, plus inflation.

Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Whilst first-time buyers make up the overwhelming majority of sales, there are also clear benefits to helping second steppers and other home owners move up the housing ladder, in turn freeing up starter homes for first time buyers to purchase.’

Andrew Montlake, a director at mortgage broker Coreco Group, said: ‘Borrowers who are paying their current mortgages without any issue are unable to take the next step up the ladder because of new affordability rules.

‘As a result there are more families living in their pre-family home who are having to look at moving further away from their places of work to obtain the space they need at a price they can afford.’

According to government figures, in June this year 15 per cent of the total 27,167 equity loans approved since its launch were to home-movers.

This compares to September last year, when they made up just eight per cent of the 5,375 loans which had been processed at the time.

Affordability tests and other new mortgage requirements have made it increasingly difficult for homeowners to borrow the extra money they need to up-size.

Which is why securing the right mortgage is more important than ever before to ensure buying a home is as affordable as possible.
