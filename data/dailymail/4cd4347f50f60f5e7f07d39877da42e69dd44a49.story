Forget give the dog a bone. This canine's happiest with his pony sidekick in tow.

Dally, a six-year-old Jack Russell Terrier from Washington State, and his pal Spanky, a seven-year-old miniature horse, were rescued by horse trainer Francesca Carson and have worked together since.

The dynamic duo appear to be inseparable, despite their difference in size. 

Video footage shows Dally confidently riding on Spanky's back, performing tricks with him and snuggling up to his big belly for a nap.

Best of friends: Dally, a six-year-old Jack Russell Terrier, and his pal Spanky, a seven-year-old miniature horse, were rescued by horse trainer Francesca Carson and have worked together since

The duo appear to be inseparable with video footage showing Dally confidently riding on Spanky's back, performing tricks with him and snuggling up to his belly for a nap

Element of trust: Francesca says the animals have a special bond 

Their owner Francesca said: 'Dally would always sit and watch while I was training Spanky and then one day she just leaped up onto Spanky's back - on that day their friendship really started.

'It's really special to see the trust they have between each other - it's remarkable for a horse to allow a dog to jump on him whenever he wants.'

Francesca, who lives on a  ranch near Spokane in Washington, rescued Spanky when he was just two years old. 

She has ten other horses at her home, where clients can sign up to horsemanship and rider development programs.

'Sometimes Spanky - who is just 32 inches tall - likes to run fast but he never does when she is on him,' added Francesca.

Sleeping buddies: After an energetic performance, the two friends take a well-earned nap

Paws off! Apparently Dally gets very protective of Spanky and growls when other dogs get too close to him

'She gets really protective of him and growls when other dogs get too close to him.

'Along with performing together they also drink and eat together - they're really close friends.'

The unlikely companions perform their tricks across America and last fall they starred on the  iconic Late Show with David Letterman.

Francesca added: 'When it is showtime Dally gets really excited and loves to show off in front of the crowds. 

'She loves riding on Spanky's back as she can see a lot more when higher up.' 

No doubt the animals will be in high demand in 2015 following their television debut.
