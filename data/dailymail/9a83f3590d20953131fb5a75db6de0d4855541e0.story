Matt Jarvis has revealed he is raring to regain fitness and help kick-start West ham’s faltering start to the season.

The 28-year-old has missed the Hammers first four games of the new campaign after picking up a thigh injury during pre-season.

Jarvis made 34 appearances for the Upton Park outfit last term, scoring four goals and the winger is itching to get back on-the-pitch.

Sam Allardyce's side travel away to Hull  in the Premier League after the international break on September 15, with Jarvis hoping to feature at the KC Stadium.

He told West Ham’s official club website: ‘I was very frustrated to pick up the injury, so yeah I really want to get back, work hard and try and get back in the team.

‘I'm gutted I'm injured, I can't believe it. I did all pre-season and then missed all the games. I'm really looking forward to getting back.’
