It's a dazzling mating dance that attracts thousands of visitors every year.

Reactions tend toward the spiritual as nature-lovers wander through Elkmont, a small trail head in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, to catch the astonishing 'light show' of the synchronous fireflies.

For two weeks every June, the winged beetles flash incredible patterns of light - a cacophony of color which turns the forest into a scene from James Cameron's sci-fi movie Avatar.

According to the National Park Service, the lightning bugs live for just 21 days as adults and produce bioluminescence to snare prey and lure mates.

Each species of firefly has a characteristic flash light pattern that make it recognizable. The males fly and flash, while stationary females respond with a spasm of light.

They flash the most within a two-week period in late May to mid-June.

'Itâ€™s mind-blowing, like a silent symphony,' North Carolina's Daniel Carlson told New York Times in 2011. 'How? Why? Why here? We have no clue.'
