Tom Daley is beginning 2015 with a new dive in his repertoire and full of optimism about his prospects of challenging for his sport's greatest prizes.

The past 12 months or so have seen plenty of change for Daley, much of which has revolved around a switch in base and coach.

He relocated from his native Plymouth to London, and his work there with Zimbabwe-born former University of Houston diving coach Jane Figueiredo has led to various adjustments in his training.

Within that, the decision has been made to scrap what Daley had referred to as his 'demon dive' - the backwards two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists routine in the piked position - and replace it with a new 'twister'.

Described as a 'forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike', this effort has the same degree of difficulty as the old one, which had been causing Daley trouble for some time.

And the 20-year-old, who claimed 10-metre platform bronze at the 2012 London Olympics, told Press Association Sport: 'I'm actually the first person in the world to perform that (new) dive - it will be a world first when I compete it at the British Championships (in Plymouth in February), which is really exciting.

'It has been done on springboard before, but never on 10-metre.

'It is a work in progress, but it is already working a lot better than my twister before.

'We had to do something that was going to make it so that my dives were the best they could possibly be, and in shape to try to challenge the Chinese, and we were never going to be able to do that with that old dive.

'This new dive has been able to change my mindset on things, and it will also be a lot better in that the judges are going to get fresh look at a brand new dive they haven't seen before.

'It is a risk, obviously, but you have to take risks if you want to win that medal.'

After the high of the Olympic medal he secured in London, 2009 10m platform world champion Daley initially struggled for motivation and with injuries, and could only manage sixth place at the 2013 World Championships in Rome.

However, following his link-up with Figueiredo, he retained gold in the event at last summer's Glasgow Commonwealth Games before claiming silver at the 2014 European Championships in Berlin.

He also publicly revealed around a year ago that he was in a relationship with a man - Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black.

And with Daley declaring he has 'never been happier with diving and life', things appear to be coming together well as he continues to work towards the major showpieces ahead - this summer's World Championships in Kazan and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

Regarding the latter, Daley has just completed a two-week training camp with his British Diving colleagues in the Brazilian city.

And he is grateful to have had the chance to spend some time at the Olympic venue.

'It is the first time I have been to South America, so the first time in Rio, and I have absolutely loved it,' Daley said.

'It was amazing walking into the pool for the first time - it really did feel like an Olympic pool and it got the heart going, for sure.

'It is really nice to come away from this camp being able to actually visualise me diving into the pool, and knowing what it looks like, what the water temperature is like, what the platform surface is like - that kind of stuff all helps.'
