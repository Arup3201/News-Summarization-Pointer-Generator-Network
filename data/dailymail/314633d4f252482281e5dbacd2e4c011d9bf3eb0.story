A multiple sclerosis patient is being forced to pay £450 a month for a drug which means he can stand up, walk and shower - even though it is prescribed free on the NHS in other parts of the country.

Phil Grace, from Great Tey in Essex, was diagnosed with MS in 2000 after suffering from symptoms since his mid-20s.

Constant muscle spasms left the 59-year-old unable to sleep at night and relying on a stick to walk.

But Mr Grace's life was transformed when he found a drug on the internet being used by other sufferers of MS. 

Phil Grace, 59,  has to pay £450 a month for drug Sativex, which helps control the muscle spasms he experiences due to multiple sclerosis, while people in other areas are prescribed the drug on the NHS

The cannabis-based drug Sativex controls Mr Grace's muscle spasms enabling him to walk up and down stairs and get in and out of the shower safely.

He asked his GP if he could be prescribed Sativex but was left devastated when the Clinical Commission Group (CCG), which commissions care for the local area, refused to fund it.

The former manager at BT said his only option is to pay £450-a-month out of his pension for 11 daily doses of the cannabis-based drug.

Mr Grace said the 'postcode lottery' which gave some patients funding but not others was 'ludicrous'.

He said: 'It is free in some areas and you can get it willy nilly in Wales but my local authority say it is not value for money.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition of the central nervous system.

In MS, the coating around nerve fibres (called myelin) is damaged, causing a range of symptoms.

More than 100,000 people in the UK have MS. Symptoms usually start in your 20s and 30s and it affects almost three times as many women as men.

Once diagnosed, MS stays with you for life, but treatments and specialists can help you to manage the condition and its symptoms.

We don't know the cause and we haven't yet found a cure, but research is progressing fast.

'It is absolutely ludicrous really, they have never looked at the bigger picture.

'I mean I wouldn't still be paying for it if it didn't work would I?'

'The point I would make is that I am on a postcode lottery for what I can get out of the system but we all have to pay in the same amount.

'I have paid all my taxes and I just want to get something back out of it. It just needs to be a level playing field.

'I don't understand because if I was to come off it now I am likely to get worse and cost them more money.'

Mr Grace, who lives with his homeopath wife Deborah, 54, pays for his supply of Sativex with his disability living allowance and survives off his BT pension.

He uses a private prescriptions service to buy the drug from producers GW Pharmaceuticals.

Nice guidelines state that Sativex was not cost-effective as a treatment for MS, but that individual CCGs could decide whether to prescribe the drugs to individuals.

Last month the NHS in Wales announced it would fund the medicine, following an appraisal by the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group.

The drug, which is the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK, has been used by patients when other treatments prove to be ineffective.

NICE have said that Sativex, a cannabis-based drug, is not a cost-effective treatment for MS, but they are currently reviewing their guidelines on MS treatment and Sativex is included in this review

Georgina Carr, senior public affairs officer for the MS Society said: 'Unfortunately Phillip’s story is all too common - people with MS are too often subjected to a postcode lottery of access to treatments that could help them better manage the condition. 

'Those who are refused treatment by their local health services are forced to pay large sums to private providers or simply go without. NICE’s recent recommendation was made within a limited process - we urge NICE to conduct a full technology appraisal of Sativex without delay.'

A spokesman for the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, who denied Mr Grace's funding application, said they may consider handing out Sativex if it is recommended by Nice.

He said: 'Nice is currently reviewing its guidelines for the management of multiple sclerosis and is including Sativex in the scope of the consultation.

'The guidelines are due for publication in October after which the CCG will consider any recommendations.

'We do not routinely fund Sativex however patients have the right to be considered for exceptional funding if their GP or consultant feels they meet the criteria.

'A referral can be made to the CCG's exceptional case panel with clinical evidence to support the request.'
