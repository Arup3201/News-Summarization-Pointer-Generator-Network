As Breaking Bad went out with a bang last night, one superfan has devised a unique way of remembering the show's best bits through a series of fascinating pictures.

Student Ariana Gonzales, 21, who is from the town the hit series is set in, has visited many of the places that feature in the programme and taken a real-time snap shot of some of the iconic scenes.

So as viewers mourn the end of the hit show, Ariana's project provides a glimpse into the world of the successful drama.

Ariana, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, said: ‘What you see in this set of pictures is a screen shot from Breaking Bad placed in the environment it was filmed in.

‘I wanted to capture the reality of the show by taking memorable or iconic scenes and places throughout seasons one to five. I wanted to breathe more life into the show by presenting the actual setting of the scenes.

The project features familiar sights from the AMC drama, including the pizza on the roof scene and the lawyer's office.

Legal eagle: The real-life office of Walt's lawyer, Saul Goodman

Ariana was able to recreate the scenes by 'playing with depth' with a camera, which meant painstakingly trying to find the right position to shoot in.

‘I would match up something within the picture and measure how far or how close it needed to be from the camera,’ the media studies undergraduate said.

‘From there, I chose the correct angle in order to create the illusion of a unified shot.

'Fans are excited to see the reality of their beloved show, while others are interested in how I was able to create these photos.’

She has been hooked on the show since the beginning and even thanked producers for choosing her home town as its set.

She continued: ‘I have been a huge fan of Breaking Bad since the beginning. I have watched Walter White transform into an international drug lord named Heisenberg. As the series comes to an end, I am eager to see how Walter gets himself out of these terrible situations.

‘Personally, I would like to thank everyone that has worked with Breaking Bad. Without them choosing our small town in New Mexico, my photos would've never existed.

‘The show has put our town on the map in regards to popularity. They have helped with attracting more entertainment business to the city and for that I would like to thank them.’
