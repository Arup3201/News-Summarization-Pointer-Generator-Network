Senate Democrats thought they had a winning plan they could set out today that would pass a long-term increase of the federal government's borrowing limit and force House Republicans to accept no concessions. 

But then White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling let the cat out of the bag.

Asked during a Monday morning breakfast event whether the White House might embrace a two-to three-week extension on the nation's credit card if Congress passed it, instead of a longer deal, Sperling replied that 'longer is better for economic certainty and jobs, but it is ultimately up to them.'

That sent Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his cohorts scrambling, reports Politico, the northern Virginia newspaper that hosted the event.

A short-term deal would free Republicans to renegotiate terms in a few weeks' time, a scenario that Washington Democrats fear would open them up to a new budget stalemate, and to demands for changes to the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health insurance overhaul.

White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said Monday that it's up to Congress whether a debt limit fix would be a long-term or a short-term proposition, a message Senate Democrats didn't want to hear

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hopes to force a long-term debt limit increase through the Senate and drop it on House Republicans, forcing them to take a stand on extending the reach of America's credit card

Democrats had hoped that the White 
House would walk that assertion back later in the day, but spokesman Jay
Carney didn't.

'How 
Congress fulfills it, as long as they fulfill it without drama or delay,
without brinksmanship, without threatening default, is up to them,' 
Carney said Monday afternoon, 'and the duration that they attach to it, 
again, is up to them.'

'What our position has always been,' he added, 'has not been, raise it for a certain amount of time.  It has been, raise the debt ceiling without drama and delay. So whatever the duration, our position will not change.'

He said what? Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (R) was taken aback by Sperling's candid comments, and by day's end the White House didn't do much to clear things up

The new position, which seemed to represent the first chink in the Obama administration's high-stakes armor, came as Reid and other Senate Democrats were preparing to force the issue and pass their own long-term increase on the government's borrowing limit. 

Uncle Sam is expected to hit the current ceiling on October 17, and could default on the nation's $16.7 trillion debt if new authority isn't granted to rack up more obligations.

The Senate will likely be the next to act, with Reid expected to offer a bill Tuesday or Wednesday that would authorize a new debt ceiling increase with no strings attached – and for a prolonged period of time.

Republicans there could filibuster that measure, however. But that has never been done on a budget measure such as this.

Reid would need to find at least six GOP senators willing to support 'cloture,' a measure that ends debate and forces a formal vote. With just 52 Democrats on his side, plus two independents who are Democrats in all but name, the GOP has enough power to block him if they remain unified.

Without significant concessions, a senior Republican Senate aide told MailOnline, that scenario is increasingly likely. Republicans are demanding deep budget cuts to ensure that annual deficits, currently in excess of $750 billion, slow down their cumulative effect on the larger debt number over time.

'Really, Mr. President!': Boehner said a White House official told him the president would rather default on America's debts than negotiate with Republicans

President Obama has kept the pressure on, seemingly dismissing any thought that he might concede ground to Republicans in exchange for a debt-ceiling hike

And House Republicans, led by Boehner, are still holding out for concessions on Obamacare.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner ratcheted up the pressure on Monday, saying on the House floor that 'a senior White House official' told him 'the president would rather default than to sit down and negotiate.'

'Really?' Boehner asked. 'The president – I will say this again – a senior White House staffer this morning said that the president would rather default on our debt than to sit down and negotiate. Now the American people expect when their leaders have differences, we're in a time of crisis, that we'll sit down and at least have a conversation.'

'Really, Mr. President, it's time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk.'

Earlier in the day, the president told employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that he wouldn't be pressured to negotiate with Boehner over the nation's debt limit while a default was looming.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) signaled that she might bolt from the Republican leadership and side with Democrats, saying, 'We shouldn't be dismissing anything out of hand'

Any port in a storm: White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president just wants the authority to borrow more money, 'whatever the duration' Congress might approve

'We're not going to establish that pattern,' Obama said, adding that 'we're not going to negotiate under the threat of ... economic catastrophe.'

Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said Monday that the U.S. must act quickly to ensure the security of more than $1 trillion in Chinese investments in America.

'The clock is ticking,' Zhu warned.

The White House and its Senate allies are hoping a long-term debt limit hike proposal would force the GOP's hand if it lands on Boehner's desk.

There are signs that some Senate Republicans are more eager to resolve the stalemate than to see a permanent winner declared.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska moderate, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that 'we shouldn't be dismissing anything out of hand, whether it's the debt ceiling or what we're going to do with this government shutdown.'

'We've got a situation where you've got a calendar running, you've got people who are frustrated and upset, so let's figure it out.'
