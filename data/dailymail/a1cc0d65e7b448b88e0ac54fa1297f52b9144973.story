Tragic: Salon owner Fay Wesley, above, swallowed the shard after applying English mustard to her home-cooked meal

A businesswoman died after swallowing a sharp 'slither' of glass which had come from a jar of English mustard, an inquest has heard.

Hair salon owner Fay Wesley, 68, consumed the shard shortly after sitting down to a steak dinner with her husband Alan.

It pierced her carotid artery, 
causing a massive bleed behind her throat which led to a 
swelling of the airways and a lack of oxygen to brain.

An investigation into her death revealed the undamaged jar of mustard which she had taken the condiment from had 29 more pieces of glass concealed in the thick yellow sauce.

Despite a thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a coroner today admitted the appearance of glass in the jar was a 'mystery' before recording a verdict of accidental death.

Mrs Wesley had planned a night in on March 14 this year, preparing a meal of steak, peas and dumplings for herself and her spouse.

An inquest heard how, while her Alan, her husband of 51-years had opted for French mustard, the hairdresser chose the English version and the jar which was riddled with glass.

As she ate,  Mrs Wesley became 'very unwell very quickly' the inquest was told.

Alan, dressed all in black, told the hearing in Newbury, Berkshire: 
'She grabbed her throat and said "I’ve got a piece of glass in my mouth"
Then she took it out.

'It was about an inch long and a quarter of an inch thick.'

The 72-year-old widower described the fragment as a 'slither', adding: 'The last words she said to me were ‘pat me on the back’

Desperate Mrs Wesley panicked and tried to leave 
the 
couple’s £300,000 home in Harts Hill Road, near Upper Bucklebury,
Berkshire.

But neighbours, including one retired Met police officer laid her down in the hallway while paramedics rushed to the scene.

Recalling the moment, Mr Wesley said: 'By that time she had gone, really.'

Mrs
Wesley was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and later 
transferred to Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire. She died on 
the afternoon of March 21.

A subsequent investigation examined Mrs Wesley’s final meal and the jar of English mustard she had taken sauce from.

Detective
Constable Emma Daly, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest: 'The 
contents of the jar were examined, which revealed fragments of glass.

'There were some 30 fragments of glass found in the mustard. There was no damage to the jar found.'

No shards of glass were found in the remains of Mrs Wesley’s dinner.

A search of glassware in the couple’s home found no indication of where the fragments could have originated.

Forensic crime scene investigator Stuart Gray said: 'The jar had a very old, worn label with a sell-by date of 2011 and appeared to be from Marks and Spencer.'

It is now known where the mustard was bought from as it was not consistent with the labels on the jar.

Mr Gray added that there was no evidence of any damage to the jar.

He could not find any other crockery in the house with damaged glass and added: 'The
origin of this chip was not identified and could well have been 
disposed of by the homeowners between making the contents and 
consuming.'

Recording a conclusion of accidental 
death, Dr Fegan-Earl said: 'It seems something of a mystery as to 
exactly where this glass may have come from.'

Addressing
Mr Wesley, he said: 'If we look at the evidence very clearly, your meal
had no glass in it whatsoever and really the only difference between 
your two meals was that you had French mustard and she had English 
mustard.

'We do know there were some 30 shards of glass recovered from that mustard pot.

'While there is no obvious evidence of damage, one must assume that the shards must have come from there.

'Sadly I don’t think we can take it any further as to where that came from.

'It is, to my mind, an almost unique occurrence and one that we cannot really take any further.'

He
added: 'I don’t think anyone could have predicted that this could 
happen and a careful police investigation has failed to find any cause 
for concern or, indeed, the exact source of the glass.'
