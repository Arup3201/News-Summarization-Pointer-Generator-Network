Tragedy: Keegan died just five days after she graduated from Yale in 2012 in a car accident (above)

Cleared: Marina's boyfriend Michael Gocksch (right) had been driving at the time of the crash but was not speeding or under the influence so was cleared in his girlfriend's death 

Keegan had just graduated five days earlier in 2012 when her boyfriend, Michael Gocksch, crashed his car after falling asleep at the wheel while the couple was driving in Massachusetts.

Gocksch, who survived the crash, was not speeding or under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the accident, and did not face any charges.

Even though she had just graduated, Keegan was already well on her way to an illustrious literary career, having already scored a job with The New Yorker.

She had studied English at Yale and graduated magna cum laude from the Ivy League institution. 

The week before her death she published an essay in her school paper urging members of her generation to 'make something happen to this world,' which went viral with more than 1.4 million hits according to The Independent.

It was this work, and others, the publisher Simon & Schuster says 'captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation' that has made her into what they call an 'icon of her generation.'

'We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I could say that’s what I want in life. What I’m grateful and thankful to have found at Yale, and what I’m scared of losing when we wake up tomorrow and leave this place.'

'We’re so young. We’re so young. We’re twenty-two years old. We have so much time. There’s this sentiment I sometimes sense, creeping in our collective conscious as we lay alone after a party, or pack up our books when we give in and go out – that it is somehow too late. That others are somehow ahead. More accomplished, more specialized. More on the path to somehow saving the world, somehow creating or inventing or improving. That it’s too late now to BEGIN a beginning and we must settle for continuance, for commencement.'

'We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I’d say that’s how I feel at Yale. How I feel right now. Here. With all of you. In love, impressed, humbled, scared. And we don’t have to lose that.'

'We’re in this together, 2012. Let’s make something happen to this world.'

Winner: Esther Grace Earl, who died of cancer in 2010 and became the inspiration for The Fault In Our Stars (left), was also a winner for her memoir This Star Won't Go Out (right)
