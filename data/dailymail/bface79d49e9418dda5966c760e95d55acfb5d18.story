A man who spent almost $35,000 trying to learn some of Donald Trump's real estate secrets claimed he left the sessions with little more than a photo of him next to a life-sized cardboard cut out of Trump to show for his investment.Â 

Bob Guillo, of Long Island, said: 'They 
told everybody to get their credit card limits raised to buy real 
estate, but the true purpose was to pay $35,000 for the next bunch of 
seminars.'

Another entrepreneur hoping to learn the secrets of the trade was Nora Hanna, who said she paid $17,000 for the Trump University program, before concluding 'what I learned there, I could read on the internet'.

It took the Brooklyn woman two months to get her money back, as promised to those who changed their mind within three days.

'They wouldn't answer my calls or emails,' she said, adding that eventually the money was returned.

Trump's former students have been coming forward to tell their stories in the wake of a $40 million lawsuit against The Apprentice star and his real estate school by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

Mr Schneiderman claims Trump helped run a phony university that promised to make students rich but instead steered them into expensive and largely useless seminars.

The billionaire developer said Schneiderman's lawsuit was false and that his school had done a 'fantastic job', with a 98 per cent approval rating among students from around the country.

He called the attorney general 'a political hack looking to get publicity'.

Mr Guillo said during group seminars he attended in New York hotel conference rooms in 2009 and early 2010, an instructor 'was flashing his Rolex watch and wearing a very expensive suit and fancy cufflinks as he told us his rags-to-riches story'.

'We followed PowerPoint presentations, and they gave us loose-leaf manuals and websites you could pull up on your home computer. We were all scammed,' Mr Guillo claimed.

However, not everyone feels that way, with another former student calling her experience 'extremely positive'.

'It was an education that opened the door for us in real estate,' Marla Rains-Colic said.

Ms
 Rains-Colic and her husband paid $25,000 for a private three-day 
mentorship progam in St Louis with a real estate expert chosen by 
Trump's organization.

Michael
 Greco is another student who has called the lawsuit baseless. After a 
free introductory presentation, the New Jersey resident spent $500 for 
an online tutorial offered by Trump.

'I
 got my value, and it was real value,' Mr Greco said, adding that he 
never felt pressured to pay or do any more than that. 'I got my money's 
worth,' he added.

Complaint: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman brought the suit against Trump

According 
to the lawsuit, some students in the initial three-day group seminar 
costing $1,495 were upset that they were pressured to take more 
expensive Trump 'Elite' programs.

When
 Associated Press asked for names of students who testified for the 
lawsuit, Mr Schneiderman's office provided only two - Mr Guillo's and Mr
 Hanna's.

Another student claiming the program failed to fulfill its promise of insider expertise is Sema Tekinay.

She
 said she paid $10,000 in 2009 and was supposed to get three 
instructor-led courses in New York or New Jersey, with access to 
advisers to guide her to private lenders and foreclosed properties.

Instead, she said, she was told the courses would be offered in Texas and California - and then, only online.

She tried to cancel but was told she could not because three days had already passed. 'I felt fooled,' she said.

Another
 student, Gregory Ryan, has sued Trump University separately in state 
court on Long Island, saying he was the victim of a $25,000 'rip-off'.

A
 class-action lawsuit was also filed against Trump University in a San 
Diego court by Tarla Makaeff, on behalf of students nationwide, claiming
 she was scammed out of nearly $40,000 while attending seminars in 2008.

Mr Scheiderman filed the suit on Saturday, and Trump immediately shot back that it was false and politically motivated.

Mr Schneiderman
 claimed many of the 5,000 students who paid up to $35,000 thought they 
would at least meet Trump but instead all they got was their picture 
taken in front of a life-size picture of him.

'Trump
 University engaged in deception at every stage of consumers' 
advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm,' 
Schneiderman said.

'Trump 
University, with Donald Trump's knowledge and participation, relied on 
Trump's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of 
consumers who believed in the Trump brand.'

State Education Department officials told Trump to change the name of his enterprise years ago, saying it 
lacked a license and didn't meet the legal definitions of a university.

In 2011 it was renamed the 'Trump Entrepreneur Institute', but it has since been
 dogged by complaints from consumers and a few civil 
lawsuits claiming it didn't fulfill its advertised claims.

Mr Schneiderman's
 lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011 and it claims that students paid 
between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn from the mogul.

He said the 
three-day seminars failed to teach consumers everything they 
needed to know about real estate, as the 'university' had promised. The Trump University manual tells 
instructors not to let consumers 'think three days will be enough to 
make them successful', Mr Schneiderman said.

Angered: Trump accused the attorney general of being politically motivated with his lawsuit and said it was a way for Schneiderman to try to extort campaign contributions from him

At the seminars, 
consumers were told about 'Trump Elite' mentorships that cost $10,000 to
 $35,000 in which students were promised individual instruction until they made 
their first deal.

Mr Schneiderman said participants were urged to extend 
the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals, but then used the
 credit to pay for the Trump Elite programs.

The attorney general said 
the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised.

The lawsuit added that many of students were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far 
worse off than before the lessons, facing thousands of dollars in debt.

But
 Trump's attorney accused Mr Schneiderman of trying to extort campaign 
contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation.

Attorney
 Michael D. Cohen told The Associated Press on Saturday that 
Schneiderman's lawsuit was filled with falsehoods. Mr Cohen insisted 
that Trump and his university never defrauded anyone.

'The attorney general has been angry 
because he felt that Mr Trump and his various companies should have 
done much more for him in terms of fundraising,' Mr Cohen said. 'This 
entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous 
waste of taxpayers' money.'

State Board of Elections records show Trump has spent more than $136,000 on New York campaigns since 2010.

He contributed $12,500 to Mr Schneiderman in October 2010, when Mr Schneiderman was running for attorney general, records show.

An outspoken conservative, Trump himself flirted with a presidential run last year.

'Donald Trump will not sit back and be extorted by anyone, including the attorney general,' Mr Cohen said.

Mr Schneiderman is suing the program, Trump as the university chairman, and the former president of the university in a case to be handled in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.

He accuses them of engaging in persistent fraud, illegal and deceptive conduct and violating federal consumer protection law. The $40 million he seeks is mostly to pay restitution to consumers.

He dismissed Trump's claim of a political motive.

'The fact that he's still brave enough to follow the investigation wherever it may lead speaks to Mr Schneiderman's character,' Mr Schneiderman spokesman Andrew Friedman told AP.
