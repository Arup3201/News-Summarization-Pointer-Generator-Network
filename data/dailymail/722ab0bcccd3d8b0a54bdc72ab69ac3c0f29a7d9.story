You can imagine the surprise on the 75-year-old woman’s face when a flight in her light aircraft was interrupted by two F-16 fighter jets.

But the Kitfox Model 2 being flown by Myrtle Rose had entered restricted airspace during President Barack Obama's visit to Chicago this week.

Defence officials scrambled the jets when air traffic controllers could not contact Ms Rose, of South Barrington, Illinois, as she had no radio.

President Obama was in Chicago on Wednesday night for a special fundraiser celebrating his 50th birthday at the historic Aragon Ballroom.

Ms Rose had meanwhile taken off from Mill Rose Farm Airport, a North American Aerospace Defense Command spokesman said.

But officials could not contact her when she entered restricted airspace, so the jets were summoned from Toledo, Ohio, to intercept her.

'She was unaware that she had entered restricted air space,’ local deputy police chief Ray Cordell said. ‘“Surprised” was probably the right term.

‘We do not have fighter jets flying over the village very often.’ The town is home to about 4,500 residents and is 30 miles from Chicago.

Ms Rose, who was flying alone, turned her Kitfox aircraft around and landed it back at Mill Rose Farm Airport.

Another NORAD spokesman said there are ‘no lines drawn in the air’ when a temporary flight restriction is put in place.

‘It's sometimes a little hard to tell where you're at,’ the NORAD spokesman said. ‘Typically, it's just a mistake.’

The pilot met with local authorities and the Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident. Ms Rose has not yet commented.

Ms Rose is the wife of the late William Rose, who was among the founders of South Barrington village, reported the Chicago Daily Herald.
