An 'internet Del Boy' who became an online trading millionaire has been jailed for a £300,000 tax swindle.

John Woolfenden, 52, made a fortune selling CDs, DVDs and console games on websites such as Play.com and eBay.

However, Woolfenden, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, who traded under the name 'Globalworldentertainments', had failed to pay tax or VAT on at least £300,000 of his earnings.

The fraud, including unpaid taxes, interest and money laundering totalling £299,753.17, was unearthed as part a crackdown on online tax evasion by HMRC inspectors.

When officers raided his home in May last year they found it set up as a base for online trading, with DVDs, CDs and games stored all over the property, including in the shower.

During the fraud Woolfenden had more than 500,000 listings on eBay and accountants discovered that nearly £1.4million had passed through his online bank accounts over six years.

Woolfenden made no mention of his online trading income on his Self Assessment tax returns and, when challenged by HMRC for details of the trade, ignored the requests and did not respond to letters

Woolfenden is also said to have routed other payments through an American bank account in an attempt to disguise his income and launder his profits.

He made no mention of his online trading income on his Self Assessment tax returns and, when challenged by HMRC for details of the trade, he ignored the requests and did not respond to letters.

He pleaded guilty to three charges of evading tax, VAT and money laundering at a hearing in June and has now been jailed for two years by a judge at Bolton Crown Court.

Speaking after the hearing, Sandra Smith, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said the trader's online earnings should have been declared

She said: 'Woolfenden did not declare his true income on his Self Assessment tax returns; he did not register for VAT, or pay VAT owed for his commercial trading online.

'He stole a substantial sum of money purely to line his own pockets.

'HMRC will pursue every avenue to ensure evaded taxes are restored to the taxpayer and public finances.'

Tax inspectors launched a campaign to target the earnings of online traders in 2012, and are continuing to use data to pursue prosecutions against potential tax evaders.
