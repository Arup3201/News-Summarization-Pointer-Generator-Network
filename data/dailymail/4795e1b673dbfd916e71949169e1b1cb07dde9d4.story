A Perth café owner illegally deducted money from staff wages if they put tomato on the wrong layer of a club sandwich or served cold pizza.

When a female cook's crackling on a pork belly dish was deemed 'not crispy enough', the woman had $112 taken from her pay by the owner, reflective of the total bill from diners at the table which ordered the meal. 

The café in Subiaco must now pay thousands in compensation and penalties after the Fair Work Ombudsman found the owner was illegally deducting money from staff wages.

Paying the price: A Perth café owner illegally deducted money from staff wages for various 'offences' including $30 for putting tomato slices on the wrong layer of a club sandwich

Fair Work received complaints from four staff members and learnt of the various reasons why staff wages were being docked.

$30: if tomato was placed in the wrong layer of a club sandwich$18.90: if a hair was found in a breakfast dish$12: for overcooking a waffle$12: for burning an omelette $12: for serving cold pizza$10: for failure to prepare parsley for the following day

Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the business also illegally deducted $100 from staff pay packets each time an employee was more than five minutes late for a shifts.

'Further, this employer was asking its staff to pay up to $1200 each out of their own pockets for in-house cooking demonstrations by the café's head chef,' she said.

The owner deducted staff pay between June, 2012 and May last year and the affected employees were from India and Nepal on Regional Sponsored Migration Visas at the time.

None of the affected employees continue to work at the café and they all received $5,000 compensation from their former boss following conciliation before the Fair Work Commission.

The ombudsman also issued the business on-the-spot fines totalling $7650 and a Letter of Caution placing it on notice that further contraventions of workplace laws could result in enforcement action.

Fair Work inspectors also found the café was failing to issue workers with pay-slips and not keeping accurate time-and-wages records for its employees.

While the café is still open for business, it is being monitored to make sure it complies with workplace laws.

Ms James said deducting money from employee wages as a punishment, or as a 'performance management tool' was illegal.

'And it is clearly not a constructive way of encouraging staff to improve their performance if there are performance issues that need addressing.

She said research showed employee productivity and motivation was at its highest when staff were part of a workplace culture where theirs contribution are valued and they are supported by 'strong' and 'positive' leaders who encourage them.

Ms James said the Subicao example is a timely reminder to other employers of the workplace law obligations and that deductions unauthorised by employees and which do not comply with relevant laws are illegal.

'Clearly these deductions only benefited the employer, which is why we have taken this matter seriously and sought a commitment from the business this behaviour will not be repeated,' she said.

The Fair Work Ombudsman also considers employers' attempts to exploit vulnerable overseas workers, who often are unaware of their workplace rights, as very serious Ms James added.

She encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate or not to contact Fair Work.

Each of the affect employees has been paid $5,000 in compensation by the café owner for his illegal behavior
