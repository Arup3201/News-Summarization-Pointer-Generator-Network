Two close friends have been killed after being hit by an 'out of control' truck while on holiday with their wives in Thailand.

It is not known whether their wives witnessed the tragedy.

Reports from the holiday island say the truck originally collided with a Toyota Corolla and veered off the road.

It then hit Mr Gent - the former head of Oldham's trading standards - and Mr Holmes, before smashing into a tea shop.

The driver of the Toyota told police he was driving home from the beach when the truck tried to overtake him causing a collision which span the pick-up 'out of control'.

The truck driver is critically ill in a Bangkok hospital, while the driver of the Toyota escaped unharmed.

Mr Gent and father-of-three Mr Holmes had been staying with their wives in a hotel close to where the accident happened.

It is believed their devastated widows were returning home today.

Neighbours on Croft Head Drive, Milnrow, where keen angler Mr Gent lived, paid tribute.

One, who was visibly upset, said: 'They were both absolutely wonderful men. Everyone is still in shock.'

Another said: 'We'll miss them very much. They were both lovely people.'

A third neighbour added: 'I have lost two fantastic friends.'

Mr Gent retired from Oldham council about four years ago.

Long-standing councillor Hugh McDonald said: 'Derek was always very courteous and pleasant and dealt with things very well. It is an awful tragedy.'

John Battye, a fellow Oldham councillor, added: 'Derek was very professional and transformed our service from mediocre to first class.

'He was a very tall, handsome fellow and had quite a presence.'

Mr and Mrs Holmes lived just a few yards away from the Gents on Yeoman's Close.

One neighbour said: 'Our thoughts are with both families. It is just absolutely tragic.' Another added: 'Michael will be missed. Our deepest sympathies go to both families.'

Mr Holmes is believed to have worked in sales.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth office confirmed it had been informed of their deaths and added: 'We are aware of the death of two British nationals in Thailand on March 23.

'We are providing full consular assistance to the families at this time.'
