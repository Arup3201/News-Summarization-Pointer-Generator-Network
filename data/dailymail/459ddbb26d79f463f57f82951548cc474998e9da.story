David Willetts provoked outrage after he said older people should retrain so they can keep working

A minister has been condemned for suggesting that the over-60s should go to university and retrain so they can keep working.

David Willetts, the Higher Education Minister, said older workers should keep their skills up to date by taking out loans to fund degrees.

‘Education is such a good thing it is not reserved for younger people,’ he said.

‘There will be people of all ages who will want to study. There is great value in lifelong learning.’

He added that there was now nothing to stop older people from applying for university as the ‘ageist’ limits on student loans for the over-55s had been lifted.

The Government wants older people to stop simply studying for leisure and start taking vocational courses. But pensioner groups say the plan would put unfair pressure on people to run up huge debts to fund potentially futile degrees.

Ros Altmann, a former government pensions adviser, said: ‘The average private pension pot is just under £30,000 in total, the same amount as a three-year degree.

‘For an older person who may never go on to earn more than £21,000 [the threshold before you start paying back student loans], it is a huge investment.

‘Many of them will never end up paying off their loans. Why should society be paying for them?’  

Dr Altmann said older workers would be better off doing shorter courses, many of which could be provided by employers. Critics fear that graduates already struggling to find work will have to compete with older people for scarce jobs.

Neil Duncan-Jordan of the National Pensioners Convention said: ‘At a time of rising youth unemployment, it seems counterproductive that they should be competing with the over-60s for scarce jobs.

‘Does David Willetts really think someone in their 60s will spend three years racking up £30,000 in debt when there are no guarantees the degree will lead to a job?

‘Older workers face invisible barriers of age discrimination in the workplace and studying for a degree will do nothing to resolve that.’

But Mr Willetts said: ‘There is certainly a pressure for continuing to get retrained and upskilled.

‘Higher education has an economic benefit in that if you stay up to date with knowledge and skills you are more employable.’

‘The idea that you first study and then stop isn’t what the world is like any more.’

Of the 552,240 undergraduates in Britain last year, 1,940 were over 60 – only 0.35 per cent.

Last year, Whitehall mandarin Lord Bichard suggested that the elderly should ‘earn’ their pensions by doing voluntary work in exchange for the payment.

The former head of the Benefits Agency triggered fury when he suggested a series of rewards and fines should be used to make sure the elderly made a ‘useful contribution to civil society’.

A quarter of Britons will be aged over 65 by 2033.

To reflect this, the State pension age will rise to 67 in 2028.
