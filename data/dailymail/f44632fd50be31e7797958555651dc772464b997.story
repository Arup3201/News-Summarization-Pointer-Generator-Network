Some popular antidepressants could double the risk of a child being born with a heart defect if an expectant mother takes them in early pregnancy, an expert has warned.

Professor Stephen Pilling,  of drug rationing body National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), believes the risk is such that they are not worth taking for women with mild to moderate depression.

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, have been used in up to one in six women of child bearing age.

The risk of a baby being born with a 
heart defect is around two in 100, the BBC reports. 

But Professor Pilling said evidence suggests if a mother took an SSRI in early pregnancy the risk increases to around 
four in 100.

The Panorama programme has spoken to eight mothers who had babies born with serious heart defects.

All of them had taken a commonly used SSR antidepressant while pregnant.

While prescription guidelines only warn specifically against giving women the SSRI, paroxetine, in early pregnancy,  Professor Pilling, has said that advice is about to be updated, as available evidence 'suggests there is a risk'.

He said: 'We make a quite a lot of effort really to discourage women from smoking or drinking even small amounts of alcohol in pregnancy, and yet we're perhaps not yet saying the same about antidepressant medication, which is going to be carrying similar - if not greater - risks.'

He said Nice guidance will be revised to take into account that the group of antidepressants are 'linked to heart defects.'

He added that women not suffering from the most severe depression who become pregnant whilst taking the drug are taking an 'unnecessary risk'.

Lundbeck, the manufacturer of one of the SSRIs, Citalopram, told the BBC a recent review of scientific literature concluded the drug 'does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of major foetal malformations'.

They warned not prescribing the drug to a depressed woman could generate greater risks to her and her baby that the medication itself.
