An honour student forced to spend a night in jail for missing too much school has received international support, and a Louisiana-based group has raised more than $91,000 for the teen.

Diane Tran, a junior at Willis High School near Houston was ordered by a Texas judge to spend 24 hours behind bars and pay a $100 fine for her excessive truancy because she was forced to work two jobs to support her siblings.

The 17-year-old has received international support from people in 49 states and 15 countries as people have chipped in to help the student make ends meet.

Ms Tran, who works part time for a wedding planner and full-time for a dry-cleaners, also manages to squeeze in a full course load. She told KHOU 11 News that she missed around three days of school every month because of sheer exhaustion.

Louisiana Children’s Education Alliance has been one such organisation to help out Ms Tran, helping her raise more than $91,000 on HelpDianeTran.com.

LCEA president Charlie Davis told Fox News that the story of Ms Tran is just one example of a ‘student who’s obviously working so hard and is being taken advantage of by the system.’

He continued: ‘I think Diane unfortunately is at the centre of two failed systems in America – our public education system and our judicial system.’

Mr Davis said he hopes the 17-year-old student puts the money to supporting her brother and sister, and her college education.

Since her story spread around the world, the Texas teenager told KHOU that she’s fixing all of her attention on finals, and will grant more interviews once the school year is over.

Meanwhile, the judge presiding over the case, Judge Lanny Moriarty said that he was offering no comment on the case.

LCEA is petitioning Judge Moriarty to cancel the fine and the jail sentencing so her future ambitions - including college applications - won't be marred.

According to Texas state law, Ms Tran violated the state’s truancy laws, which do not allow more than 10 days of absences within a six-month period.

Ms Tran said she works a full time job, a part-time job, and takes advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School.

'[I take] dual credit U.S. history, dual credit English literacy, college algebra, Spanish language AP,' she said of her impressive academic workload.

However, the high-achiever cannot devote as much time as she would like to her schooling as she often misses an entire day, reported KHOU.

Ms Tran said that her parents divorced 'out of the blue,' leaving her and her two siblings to fend for themselves.

And so, it fell to Ms Tran to support her siblings, who include an older brother at Texas A&M University and a younger sister who lives with relatives.

Local authorities are using Ms Tran's case to crackdown on truancy.

At the sentencing, Judge Moriarty ordered the exhausted student to pay a $100 fine and spend 24 hours in jail as a lesson.

According to Texas state law, students who are absent from school without parental consent for three days in a four-week period or ten or more days in a six-month period are subject to prosecution.

The exact punishment for offenders is left for the judge to decide.

Parents of children who miss excessive amounts of school may also be prosecuted.

The strict law is in place to keep students in school and learning.

'If you let one [truant student] run loose, what are you gonna' do with the rest of 'em? Let them go too?' he said.

He had warned her last month to stop missing her classes.

Ms Tran's employer at the Waverly Manor wedding venue, where she works over the weekends, suggested that the authorities should 'help [the family], don't harm them'.

Ms Tran also works full-time at a dry cleaners.

Her co-worker and classmate Devin Hill told the network how hard her friend works.

'She goes from job to job, from school, she stays up 'til 7 o'clock in the morning to study' she said.

On the homepage of the school's website, there is a warning to students to be vigilant about their attendance.

'Should a student have multiple unexcused absences and a pattern of failing to attend school regularly, the law is clear that the matter becomes the jurisdiction of the court system,' it states.

However, locals are arguing that Ms Tran's case is unique and should be treated with more leniency.

Ms Tran, in the meantime, is worried this could mar her future ambitions - she one day hopes to become a doctor.
