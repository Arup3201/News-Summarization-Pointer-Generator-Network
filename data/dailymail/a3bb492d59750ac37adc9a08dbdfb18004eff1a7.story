This is the dramatic moment a disabled arsonist almost set fire to his walking stick after starting a blaze outside a letting agent.

CCTV shows the disabled man limping in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, before leaning his walking stick against the window while he pours fuel in the doorway of the business and sets it on fire.

The incident outside Landlords Sales & Lettings last Tuesday at 8.30pm then saw the arsonist limp away from the fire - before returning to battle the flames in order to retrieve his walking stick.

Local residents are then spotted 
racing out of their properties carrying washing up bowls filled with 
water which they use to extinguish the fire.

Mohammed
 Aftab, who owns the letting agents, said: ‘This is a very bad thing 
because the people living upstairs have a three-month-old kid, so it 
could have been much worse.

‘We want to know the motivation, why they were willing to burn the place and risk other people’s lives.’

No one was injured in the fire which caused several thousands of pounds worth of damage to the building.

‘It is not a massive amount of damage because it was controlled by neighbours, but it could have been much worse.

‘It is not going to shut the business or anything. We will carry on, but we have been shattered by this.’

West Midlands Police are treating the attack as arson and say they are pursuing several lines of inquiry.

A spokesman said: ‘We want to trace the man in the CCTV images to help with our investigation. He is described as having shoulder length hair and was wearing a brown jacket and jeans and using a walking stick.’
