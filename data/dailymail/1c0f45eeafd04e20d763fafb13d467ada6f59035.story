West Ham will offer Darren Fletcher a three-and-a-half year deal worth £75,000-a-week when the formalities of his move from Manchester United are completed. 

Louis van Gaal confirmed that the Scotland international was close to finalising a move to London on Friday, which would end his 20-year association with the club.

Speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Leicester City, manager Van Gaal said: 'He is now in West Ham, I believe so we have to wait and see.

'He’s my third captain so he is an important guy in the dressing room. I like him as a human being and a player.'

Fletcher has failed to hold down a first-team place this season at Old Trafford, despite Van Gaal initially making him vice-captain.

'We shall miss him,' the Dutchman said. 'But he has not played many times. 

'That is the main goal of a player and we have talked about that and he preferred to play therefore we have helped him.'

Van Gaal feels that United's loss will be the Hammers' gain.

'I think the future will prove how good he is,' he said. 'For us it’s a miss. It is a loss.

'For the club who buy him it is another player with a lot of qualities, as a midfielder but also as a captain, a very experienced player. 

But we also have in the same role another experienced player.'
