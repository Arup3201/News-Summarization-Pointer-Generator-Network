Everything the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to gold. From her pre-pregnancy high street steals to her chic maternity looks, Kate manages to impress every time.

So it comes as no surprise that the former Kate Middleton has been crowned the number one most fashionable icon of modern time.

Preceding Catherine’s royal flair for 
fashion, Princess Diana was also voted one of the most fashionable icons
 of all time, beaten only by the indisputable classic style of Audrey 
Hepburn.

No surprises here: The Duchess of Cambridge has been voted the modern day fashion icon, beating off the likes of Cheryl Cole and Victoria Beckham

Men and women nationwide are united in their opinion that Victoria Beckham – previously widely acclaimed as the unofficial queen of British fashion - has now been usurped by the Duchess for her trademark quintessentially British style and seemingly effortless flair with which she has become synonymous.

In an unforeseen coup de théâtre from beyond the grave Baroness Margaret Thatcher, often mocked for her 'matronly’ attire made a surprise entry in at number ten on the ‘Top Ten Most Fashionable Celebrities of All Time’ list.

Overall, the survey proves that the more classic, feminine style – currently favoured by the likes of Cheryl Cole and in her hey day the 50s movie icon, Marilyn Monroe - reigns supreme.

Top spots: Fashion designer Victoria Beckham and songstress Cheryl Cole were second and third most fashionable icons in the modern day category

Whereas the more edgy and untamed look currently associated with model of the moment Cara Delevingne and off-beat musical wild child Lady Gaga proves slightly less popular amongst men and women alike.

When it comes to female fashion, the survey also found that men and women are divided on what they deem to be attractive. 

Over half of the women included in the survey stated that a pair of heels makes them feel most attractive, whilst almost three in four men men prefer a tight dress and a mini skirt.

Getting it wrong: Katie Price and even Katy Perry were at the bottom of the pile when it came to their sense of style

Co-founder of StyleinView.co.uk, Dexter Grima, who carried out the survey, said: 'We were not surprised to see Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, crowned the most fashionable celebrity as she has demonstrated a keen eye for knowing what suits her and dressing for the occasion, similar to Princess Diana.

'From her wedding day style to more formal royal appointments, and even her maternity choices, Kate has remained consistent. 

'Her influence has been reflected in the items our users are searching for on StyleinView.co.uk with a significant increase in searches for Kate Middleton inspired dresses and bikinis.'
