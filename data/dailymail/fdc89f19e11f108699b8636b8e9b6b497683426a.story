Vitaly Milonov said the terms of the law could not be suspended or selectively enforced during the Olympic Games

Openly gay athletes and supporters at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games may face arrest, according to a Russian lawmaker.

Politician Vitaly Milonov said the terms of the law could not be suspended or selectively enforced during the Olympic Games.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) previously claimed Russia had assured the safety of athletes and supporters.

Milonov told Interfax news agency: ‘I haven’t heard any comments from the government of the Russian Federation, but I know that it is acting in accordance with Russian law. 

‘And if a law has been approved by the federal legislature and signed by the president, then the government has no right to suspend it. It doesn’t have the authority.’

He also claimed that American politicians he had spoken with support his view, reported the Huffington Post.

He said that they: support the stance I have taken on this issue.’

The IOC told the Windy City Times earlier this month: ‘The International Olympic Committee is clear that sport is a human right and should be available to all regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation.

‘The Games themselves should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media and of course athletes.

The Russian parliament issued a ban on spreading gay 
'propaganda' among minors that gay rights activists said would fuel 
attacks on homosexuals

‘We would oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardise this principle.’

The controversial ‘gay propaganda’ law bans displays of ‘non-traditional sexual behaviour’ in public or in front of under-18s.

The law allows the government to detain homosexual or sympathetic foreigners for up to 14 days.

The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  Picuttured: Officers detain gay right activists during a protest in Moscow

They could then face expulsion from the country.

This is the latest in controversial decisions by the Russian government regarding homosexual people.

Last month gay pride participants were badly beaten in St Petersburg and dozens were arrested.

Four Dutch tourists were also arrested for breaching the new ban last week, although they were later released.
