A council's decision to cut down wooden stakes from a play area over fears children might snap them in half has been branded 'utter madness'.

Parents clashed with council leaders after workmen removed the wooden stakes from the English Civil War-themed park which commemorated a famous local battle.

Killjoy health and safety officers ruled the pillars, 
in Power Park in Worcester, were dangerous because children could injure themselves if they climbed up them.

Overreaction: Parents accused Worcester City Council of being 'health and safety zealots' after advising that stakes (one of which is circled in red in this picture taken in 2011) should be removed from the play area

Barmy: The council's view that the stakes posed a risk was ridiculed by one parent who said it was 'utter nonsense'

The stakes were put up in 2011 as part of a revamp of the park, run by St Peter’s Parish Council, with £50,000 funding for the project coming from landowners Worcester City Council - the same authority that has now deemed the stakes a risk.

A Worcester City Council spokesman said: 'The concern was that the poles were not wide enough in diameter to withstand children swinging on them.

'The poles were in danger of snapping when children played on them.

'The play area was installed and run by St Peter's Parish Council. The work to cut back the posts was also carried out by them.

'Worcester City Council's only 
involvement was as the landlowner, and in that role we advised the 
parish council that the poles were not wide enough for their purpose and
therefore were a potential danger to children playing there.'

Hacked off: The fence used to have 8ftft spikes on, but was cut down to size by over-zealous council health and safety officials because it was feared a child might hurt themselves

Father-of-three Andrew Howell, 45, from Worcester, said: 'It's utter nonsense that these stakes were a health risk.

'The
children would have to shimmy up the poles to reach the spikes and
then somehow hurl themselves onto them - it's ridiculous.

'The
stakes were put up around the play park to commemorate the Civil War 
and they were a good learning tool for children while they played in the
park.

'Ironically, what we 
now have is the posts cut down to about waist height but they are more 
of a hazard with kids tripping over them.

'When
I contacted the council about the removal of the stakes I was told 
there was a risk of children impaling themselves on them.

'Once again the council have proved themselves to be health and safety zealots.'

Historic: The 8ft tall spikes surrounding the play area were supposed to be a tribute to the pikemen of the English Civil War who fought in the famous nearby Battle of Worcester in 1651 - until council workmen cut them down

Amateur photographer Bill Meadows, 77,
from Worcester, who took pictures of the park when it was unveiled, added: 
'I think it is disgusting what the council has done.

'To take them down is one thing, but now they are using them as posts, it is disrespectful. In my opinion, they are not dangerous, it is just health and safety gone mad.

'The spikes were like a fort for the children to play around, I am sure the children are disappointed about what has happened. For the council to just cut them down is madness.

'The
way they have cut the spikes has left them more dangerous than they 
were before, they are now quite sharp and could catch children who are 
not concentrating.'

Worcester City Councillor Roger Knight also opposed cutting down the display.

He
said: 'I am disappointed that they had to be cut down to two feet high 
when they were quite splendid and built to resemble the pikemen of the 
Battle of Worcester in 1651.'

Concerns: Officials feared children might, somehow, snap the thick wooden spikes which were standing in Power Park, in St Peter's, Worcester

Taxpayers' Alliance today branded a council decision to cut the stakes down as 'barmy.'

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the
TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's utterly barmy that Worcester City 
Council has forked out so much taxpayers' cash on revamping the park, 
potentially only to spend more undoing some of that work.

'Too
often health and safety rules are cited as a reason for stopping 
children from having fun, regardless of whether there are genuine risks.

'Yet, if the spikes pose a
danger to children the question has to be asked why they were included 
in the design in the fist place, let alone erected.'

But Worcester City Council earlier defended the decision.

A spokesman said: 'Children and young people were getting onto these spikes and pulling them down. Some of them were being snapped off.

'A health and safety inspector thought it was not appropriate and that they should be made safe.'
