This man’s face may well be familiar. But almost certainly you won’t be able to put a name to the face.

Because while John Walker has made more than 2,000 appearances in shows from Coronation Street to Doctor Who, he’s done it all as an extra.

Mr Walker, a 40-year-old Tesco worker, has been popping up in the background of more than 200 TV programmes for the last 14 years.

Happy couple: Mr Walker, who now works at Tesco, with Ms Raqia at their home in Dudley, West Midlands

As a result, he reckons he probably 
appears on TV at least once a day. He even met his fiancee, fellow extra
Neilum Raqia, on set.

The couple often appear together on screen, and bosses on Midsomer Murders have given them a regular role as a policing pair.

Over the years Mr Walker, who at one 
point worked full-time as an extra, has appeared in shows including The 
Bill, Gavin and Stacey and EastEnders.

He once played a doctor in Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and Emmerdale all in the same week.

He said: ‘To make a good extra you 
have to be good at blending in the background, not making big movements 
and having the ability to mime rubbish with no one knowing.

'People often say “I saw you on TV last night”. I think I’ve done so much I’m on ITV3 every day.’

Mr Walker, from Dudley in the West Midlands, had his first role in a Doctor Who spin-off show for video called Auton.

He enjoyed it so much he joined an 
agency in Bristol, winning dozens of roles. He worked full-time as an 
extra until last September, when he quit to work at Tesco, but still 
does part-time work, earning between £80 and £280 a day.

He said: ‘It might not make me millions but it’s fantastic that I met my future wife through my work.

‘It’s a great chance to get away from 
real life, have some fun and see some of the stars. I love seeing myself
in the background of the nation’s favourite programmes.’
