Australian workers are being urged to check their super statements to make sure they are receiving the correct entitlements before it's too late.

New report has found Australians are missing out on more than $2.5 billion in retirement savings because their employers are failing to comply with compulsory superannuation requirements.

The Superannuation Guarantee Non-Compliance report, compiled by specialist management consulting firm Tria Investment Partners found workers who were affected by non-compliance, loss an average of $3750 per year.

News.com.au reports the construction industry denies workers $341 million each year after failing to pay their employees 9.5 per cent each week.

Mining industry came in at second-worst for not paying employees their super entitlements of an estimate $59 million per year, followed by manufacturing at $53 million and hospitality $27 million.

Construction and building industry super fund, CBUS’s managing director David Atkin told news.com.au that the leakage problem with super being paid to employees would have catastrophic consequences on the nation’s economy.

‘It’s the cash economy, it’s sham contracting and it’s also a growing concern around insolvencies, leaking is able to occur,’ he said.

‘There is a growing problem and when those people move into retirement they will have less money to be able to fund their retirement.

‘That cost will fall back onto the public purse.’

The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia is urging all Australians to take control of their own financial destiny and put in place the savings plans they need now, to deliver them financial freedom in retirement.

While the current changes to super may be confusing, ASFA chief executive officer Pauline Vamos said now is the best time for workers to assess where they're at in terms of their retirement savings.

‘Despite the recent changes, the fact of the matter is superannuation remains the best deal in town when it comes to building your retirement savings,' she said.

‘Because it is a long-term investment, the earlier you start putting more into super, the more you will benefit from the effects of compounding interest.

‘Even just a few dollars extra a week could boost your retirement savings by thousands.

‘This is especially true for younger people, who could end up with up to seven dollars more in retirement for every dollar they put into super before the age of 30.’

Ms Vamos added: ‘These small changes could give your super savings the boost they need to help you live your retirement with comfort and dignity.

'This is why we encourage all Australians to think about the lifestyle they want in retirement and put away the few extra dollars a week they need to deliver it,' she said.
