Software tycoon John McAfee may have looked like he wasn't playing with a full deck during his time on the run, but he claims that he was strategically 'playing the crazy card.'

McAfee - who made millions from the anti-virus software firm 
that bears his name - also said that he abandoned his fortune during a hasty 
escape from Belize last month following the murder of neighbor Gregory Faull.

Following his return to the U.S. yesterday, McAfee said that his bizarre 'heart attack' scare on his first night of detention in Guatemala, which saw him whisked to a hospital with dozens of reporters and photographers in tow last week, was nothing but an act.

Speaking to ABC News after landing in Miami, McAfee said admitted that he had 'played the crazy card,' and added: 'It was a deception but who did it hurt? I look pretty healthy, don't I?'

He told the network of his relief when told he wasn't going to be detained by American authorities.

'I was met by a dozen or maybe fewer officers. I said, "Am I arrested?" They said, "No, sir, I am here to help you." That felt the best of all.'

But while seemingly free to roam South Beach, the man who was once worth $100million now says that he has nothing left.

But McAfee's did not appear to be in total arrears as he flashed a stack of $5 bills, telling ABC: 'My friend dropped off some cash.'

He criticized the Belizian authorities for failing to catch him, and thanked reporters for their 'role' in securing his escape.

'Everyone was looking for me, and they did not catch me,' he told ABC. 'I escaped, was captured and they tried to send me back. Now I'm sitting in Miami. There had to be some ineptness.

'What's a better story, millionaire mad man on the run. [The media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack somebody that the world is watching.'

When McAfee's plane landed at Miami International Airport last night, he was without a travel companion - his 20-year-old girlfriend Samantha Vanegas, who he left in Guatemala.

After landing, McAfee, 67, was escorted from the plane by airport security officers, and he quickly checked into a hotel in the exclusive South Beach area.

'Some people felt uncomfortable that he 
was on our flight. ... We all knew the story,' said Maria Claridge, 36, a
South Florida photographer who was on the Silicon Valley entrepreneur's
flight to Miami.

McAfee, who was seated in the coach section and had a whole row to himself, was wearing a suit and was 'very calm' during the flight, she added.

'He looked very tired, he looked like a man who hadn't slept in days. I'd say he even looked depressed,' said another passenger, Roberto Gilbert, a Guatemalan who lives in Miami.

McAfee had been held for a week in Guatemala, where he surfaced after evading police in Belize for nearly a month following the killing of Faull, a fellow American and neighbor on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye.

Police in Belize want to quiz McAfee 
as a 'person of interest' in Faull's death, although the technology 
guru's lawyers blocked an attempt by Guatemala to send him back there.

Authorities there say he is not a prime suspect in the investigation. McAfee has denied any role in Faull's killing.

McAfee led the world's media on a game of online hide-and-seek in Belize and Guatemala since he fled after Faull's death, peppering the Internet with pithy quotes and colorful revelations about his unpredictable life.

Residents of the Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived for about four years, said McAfee and Faull, 52, had quarreled at times, including over McAfee's unruly dogs.

McAfee belives the cops in Belize authorities will kill him if he turns himself in for questioning.

He has said he was being persecuted by Belize's ruling party after he refused to pay some $2million in bribes.

Belize's prime minister has rejected the allegations, calling McAfee paranoid and 'bonkers.'

Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said the country still wanted to question McAfee about the Faull case.

'He will be just under the goodwill of the United States of America. He is still a person of interest, but a U.S. national has been killed and he has been somewhat implicated in that murder. People want him to answer some questions," he said.

Martinez noted that Belize's extradition treaty with the United States extended only to suspected criminals, a designation that did not currently apply to McAfee.

'Right now, we don't have enough information to change his status from person of interest to suspect,' he said.
