Roberto Martinez has urged Everton’s players to rewrite history and end an Anfield hoodoo that stretches back 15 years.

Everton’s last away victory against Liverpool came on September 27, 1999 when a goal from Kevin Campbell settled a bad-tempered clash in which three red cards were shown.

Martinez’s first venture across Stanley Park as Everton manager ended in misery in January, as Liverpool ran out convincing 4-0 winners, but the Spaniard is not daunted by statistics.

Having masterminded Everton’s first win away to Manchester United in 22 years, Martinez does not see a reason why history should be a burden to this group and believes the game offers a prime opportunity to kickstart their season.

Martinez said: ‘The last time we beat Liverpool at Anfield was September 27, so let’s hope it’s the same. When we lost 3-2 to Crystal Palace, I said it was a bit spooky. It was 3-2, they had three shots on target and there was three mistakes (like last season). So let’s hope this one is as well.

‘It affects us in a positive way in my eyes because stats are there to be broken. It’s a difficult place to go but there are many others too and we have gone and changed the stats and history. I look forward to that – it’s an extra bit of motivation.’

If Everton are to do that, though, they will have to defend better than they have done this season. Mistakes have compromised Everton’s ambitions to build on last year’s fifth placed finish and they conceded six times in their last two matches.

The manager recognises the need to improve is immediate but he will not check his natural instincts to set up his team to attack. Martinez feels this will be an open and entertaining game.

‘It has been an area that we have been quite poor and we need to improve,’ Martinez admitted. ‘We need to fine tune. You sometimes have areas where you are so good that you might take it for granted. You look at the experience we have in the team. It is just making sure the focus needs to be better.

‘That is clearly an area that we need to resolve. It is affecting scorelines. I think performances have been better than last season but we need to improve. We are a confident side. We want to make sure we get more focused, better communication and face the challenge to get back to the standards of last season.

‘We don’t want to accept the amount of goals we have conceded. We don’t want to be a team that concedes cheaply. I don’t think it is in the nature of the two sides. We want to impose ourselves on the game. The city wants two teams that will grow and get better. We want to become as good as we can.’

Meanwhile, Martinez has revealed that Ross Barkley is ready to step up his rehabilitation from knee ligament damage next week when he starts running. He would not, though, discuss stories linking the England midfielder with a move to Manchester City next summer.

‘I don’t think it is anything to comment about,’ said Martinez. ‘It is a rumour and we will leave it there. We take it as a footballing compliment and move on.’
