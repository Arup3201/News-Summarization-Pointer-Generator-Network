'Murder': Thai-born mother-of one Tuanjai Sprengel, 43, was discovered dead in an alleyway in Bracknell, Berkshire. Her boyfriend Muhammad Shafi, 28, right, is accused of her murder

The suspect was arrested in the couple's one-bedroom flat just six hours after the Thai-born mother-of-one was found dead.

He was remanded in custody today by magistrates in Slough and he is due to appear again at Reading Crown Court tomorrow.

Victim: Tuanjai Sprengel, pictured as a younger lady. She was found dead by two gardeners on Sunday morning, sparking a murder investigation

Shafi, from Pakistan, was not asked to confirm his address or date of birth as an interpreter had not been provided.

The 28-year-old, who speaks limited English, was flanked by two security guards as he appeared in the dock for the brief hearing.

Presiding magistrate Graham Wykes said: 'Mr Shafi you will appear before Reading Crown Court tomorrow, May 31, for a preliminary hearing.'

No application for bail was made.

Thai-born Tuanjai, a masseuse known to her friends as 'Tuk', moved in with Shafi in February.

A friend who knew her well, said that she had a child who lived in Germany with his father. Tuanjai had been married to the German and lived with him for 14 years before coming to the UK.

'She and her boyfriend moved here in February and seemed to be very happy. He seemed to like gambling and they would go to the casino in the evenings. She used to like to use the fruit machines.'

Police said that a post-mortem examination showed that she died from a blunt force attack to the back of her head. She had also suffered the puncture wound to her neck and was covered in blood.

Her body was discovered on Sunday morning by two gardeners in an underpass near Bay Drive, Bullbrook, Bracknell.
