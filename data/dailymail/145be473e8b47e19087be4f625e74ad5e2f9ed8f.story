Bruce Willis remains a die-hard at the box office. Willis' action sequel A Good Day to Die Hard debuted as the weekend's top draw with a $25 million debut from Friday to Sunday.

The 20th Century Fox release raised its domestic total to $33.2 million since opening Thursday for Valentine's Day to get a jump on the long President's Day weekend.

The movie comes 25 years after the original Die Hard and six years after Live Free or Die Hard, the hit that resurrected the franchise centered on Willis' relentless New York City cop John McClane.

The previous weekend's No. 1 movie, Universal's comedy Identity Thief starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, was a close second with $23.4 million to lift its haul to $70.7 million.

Debuting at No. 3 with $21.4 million was Relativity Media's romance Safe Haven, starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel in an adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks novel about a woman who flees her abusive husband and takes up with a sensitive widower.

'I didn't think it was physically possible to doze off at a movie as loud as A Good Day to Die Hard, but for a few moments my mind found some distant, peaceful refuge.' David Edelstein, New York Magazine'A good day - it isn't. To quote John McClane: "Something stinks."' Susan Granger, SSG Syndicate'For anyone who remembers the "Die Hard" adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience.' Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal'This is the Magpie School of action filmmaking: Anytime things start to make so little sense that you might lose the audience, just throw something shiny up on screen to distract.' Ian Buckwalter, NPR'Few fans of the series would disagree that this sclerotic fifth installment should probably be the last.' Dana Stevens, Slate'To call the film perfunctory would be to insult properly perfunctory events, such as that visit to your least-favourite uncle.' Donald Clarke, Irish Times

Since opening on Valentine's Day, Safe Haven has taken in $30.3 million.Â 

The
Weinstein Co. animated tale Escape from Planet Earth opened at No. 4 
with $16.1 million. With a voice cast that includes Brendan Fraser, 
Jessica Alba, Sarah Jessica Parker and Rob Corddry, the movie follows 
the adventures of aliens captured by the U.S. military.

Making
a weak debut at No. 6 was the Warner Bros. teen fantasy Beautiful 
Creatures, which pulled in $7.5 million for the weekend and $10 million 
since opening Thursday.

The
movie is based on the first in the best-selling series about a Southern
misfit (Alden Ehrenreich) who falls under the spell of a teen witch 
(Alice Englert).

A Good Day to Die Hard did solid 
business despite bad reviews for the latest installment, which sends 
Willis' McClane to Moscow in search of his estranged son, an undercover 
spy who winds up teaming with the old man against Russian bad guys.

The
movie's success follows notable flops from two other holdovers of the 
1980s action scene, Sylvester Stallone with Bullet to the Head and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger with The Last Stand.

'There's
still life left in the 'Die Hard' franchise. Given the fact that pretty
much every other R-rated action movie that's come out this year has 
completely fallen flat, this is a pretty good showing,' said Paul 
Dergarabedian, an analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com.

Willis
is 'one of the old-guard action stars who still has a solid career 
going, whereas a lot of these aging action heroes, unless they're in an 
ensemble cast, they're not able to draw audiences the way they used to.'

Identity Thief starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, was a close second to A Good Day To Die Hard this weekend with $23.4 million

Safe Haven, a romance starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel, debuted at No. 3 taking $21.4 million

Overall Hollywood business remained slow, with revenues off for the fourth-straight weekend compared to the same period last year.

Domestic business from Friday to Sunday totaled $141 million, down 9.4 percent from the same weekend a year ago, when Safe House and The Vow led the way with about $23 million each.

A bright spot this year has been strong business for top Academy Awards contenders leading up to next Sunday's Oscars.

The weekend's top-20 films included eight of the nine best-picture nominees, seven of which have either topped $100 million domestically or are close.
