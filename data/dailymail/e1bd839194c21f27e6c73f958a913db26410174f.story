Frankie Gavin is confident he can expose domestic rival Bradley Skeete when the pair clash next month.

The pair are part of a mouthwatering bill at London's Excel Centre which also includes Tyson Fury vs Dereck Chisora.

Gavin defends his British welterweight title while the Commonwealth belt is also on the line on November 29.

Frankie Gavin is confident he can expose domestic rival Bradley Skeete when the pair clash next month

The Birmingham star is looking to bounce back from losing his European title challenge against Leonard Bundu in August, his first career defeat.

He took the first step on that path last Friday with a second-round knockout of Mate Hornyak.

'Deep down Skeete doesn’t want to fight me, his whole team don’t, they could've fought me a year ago but wanted no part of me. What does that tell you?' said Gavin.

'I’ve no problem facing someone like Skeete because I know I can beat him everyday of the week if I had to. Even so, I’ll leave no stone unturned to prepare for this fight, I’ll be 100 percent ready for him,”

'He’s not boxed at my level, he’s not boxed anyone of note in his career, I’ll expose him. He’s unbeaten now, but he’ll have an ‘L’ on his record after we've fought.”

Skeete has stopped three opponents in succession and has won all 18 of his professional fights.

'I could've gone another route, towards the Commonwealth title, I’m the mandatory challenger for the British title for a reason,' he said.

'He says I turned him down in the past, but I've taken this fight, I wanted this fight. I’d never run from the likes of Frankie Gavin and l'll show the reason why on the night,'

'I've got the tactics and skill to beat Gavin. My confidence is sky high at the moment

'He lost to Bundu, he tried to step up and failed, now he’s got to step up to me.'
