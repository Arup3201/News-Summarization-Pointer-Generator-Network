Devastated: Liam Botham's fiancee, Emma, owner of Woody

Sir Ian Botham’s family has doubled the reward for a dog stolen from outside the former cricketer’s home.

They have raised the reward from £2,500 to £5,000 for information leading to the return of Woody, a 15-month-old springer/cocker spaniel cross.

The pet went missing from a secure courtyard at Sir Ian’s farmhouse in Ravensworth, North Yorkshire, at 11.30 am on Sunday, November 20.

Woody’s owner, Emma Sayle, 33, fiancee of Sir Ian’s son, Liam, 34, said the family  was devastated.

Liam and Emma, whose company Killing Kittens runs ‘adult parties for open-minded’ young couples, were staying at 56-year-old Sir Ian’s home on the weekend the dog was taken.

Liam’s estranged wife, Sarah-Jayne Botham, 37, who is in the final stages of a divorce from Liam and still lives in their former marital home on Sir Ian’s estate, was arrested and questioned last month over the dog’s disappearance before being released on bail.

Police are continuing to investigate Woody’s theft.

Emma said: ‘I am now at the end of my tether. It seems like he has been lost for an eternity. 

‘He is like my baby. It would take a certain type of human being to do harm to such a docile dog.’

Emma and former rugby union star Liam have searched an area from Bishop Auckland to Catterick, North Yorkshire.
