Cabinet minister Ken Clarke will today urge David Cameron to focus on the 'positives' of Brussels staying in the European Union as he helps launch a campaign to keep Britain in the European Union.

The former Chancellor will be joined by Lib Dem treasury minister Danny Alexander and Labour's Lord Mandelson to front a ‘patriotic fightback’ against euroscepticism.

Mr Clarke will defy anti-Europe sentiment in his party to insist the PM must 'concentrate on what we are in favour of and not just what we are against' while Mr Alexander will dismiss calls to withdraw from much of the EU as 'nonsensical'.

Europhile Tory Ken Clarke will join Liberal Democrat Treasury minister Danny Alexander at the launch of the Centre for British Influence

The two coalition cabinet minister pair will be joined by former 
Labour minister Lord Mandelson, a one-time EU trade commissioner, at the
launch of Centre for British Influence in Europe.

In a provocative move the launch of the
Yes campaign to keep Britain in the European Union is being held in the
European Commission’s building in London’s Smith Square which used to 
be occupied by the Conservative Party.

Mr Clarke will use a speech at tonight's launch to urge 'strong support for a better European Union within which Britain can exert power and influence in the modern world'.

Addressing an audience of 200 people from 
the worlds of politics, the media, business, diplomacy, trade unions and
think tanks, he will say it is 'obvious' and 'essential' that the EU needs to reform in order for the UK to 'compete properly in a fiercely global marketplace'.

'The real challenge for us as we debate our role in the EU is working out what we should be pushing forward, what we should be leading on within the EU, to make it - and us - a more effective economic and global power,' he will add.

'We need to concentrate on what we are in favour of and not just what we are against.  There is a huge potential prize out there for the United Kingdom if only we focus our attention and influence in any future negotiations on the positive things that really matter.

'The fact is, that we are immensely powerful as part of a market of 500 million people.'

Mr
Clarke, a Minister without Portfolio, is the most senior Conservative 
figure to throw his weight behind the campaign against leaving the EU.

As
the Prime Minister's special representative on EU-US trade talks with a
roving brief across Whitehall he remains one of the most well-known 
figures on the Tory frontbench.

But his Europhile opinions are sharply at odds with much of the rest of the Cabinet.

Tory
party chairman Grant Shapps and London Mayor Boris Johnson have both 
suggested they could vote to quit if Britain cannot get a better deal 
from Brussels.

Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander will warn of the economic dangers of leaving Brussels

In a move likely to rile Tory 
eurosceptics, the two government ministers will share a platform with 
Lord Mandelson, who will insist anti-EU claims 'cannot go unchallenged anymore'.

Lord Mandelson will say: 'I do not 
regard today's event as firing the starting pistol for a referendum 
campaign because there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge – 
including the holding of a general election – before any point of 
decision is reached on that.

'But the point is, for far too long, 
those who want to destroy Britain's interests and influence in Europe 
have been allowed to get away with murder with the lies and false 
propaganda they have poured out about the European Union and what it 
represents for our country. This cannot go unchallenged anymore.

'The pro Europeans have bided their time. Now we must unbide our time.

'My complaint is that, often in 
Britain, we do not stand up for ourselves in Europe nearly as vigorously
and effectively as we should.

'Instead of heading up a cul de sac of
mindless, inward looking, soul searching and navel gazing, we should be
going out and spreading our influence and fighting for the agenda we 
think is good for Britain and for Europe as a whole.'

Mr Alexander, who before entering Parliament worked for campaign group Britain In Europe, will argue that Britain has a more powerful negotiating role 'inside Europe than from the sidelines'.

'The EU is not perfect by any stretch and I’m a big advocate of EU reform.

'But the idea that we should extract ourselves from the bulk of EU obligations is nonsensical.

'We can offer a more compelling 
alternative: a strong UK, influential in Europe and so more influential 
in the world. Stronger with America and China, because we are at the 
heart of the EU.'

David Cameron used a speech on European Union and Britain's role in it to promise to give Britons a straight referendum choice on whether to stay or leave

It comes as MPs debate David Cameron's landmark pledge of an in-out referendum by 2017.

David Cameron used his long-awaited speech on Europe last week to promise a referendum on leaving the EU by 2017.

The
Prime Minister said the Tories will promise at the next election to 
renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before putting the ‘fresh 
settlement’ to a straight in-out vote.

He said: '‘You will have an important choice to make about our country’s destiny.’

Organisers
of the new pro-EU campaign say they want to challenge misconceptions 
the British public hold about Europe, including fears that it costs up 
to a quarter of the nation’s economy while wielding little or no 
influence in Brussels.

It will publish an annual EU power league, to show how the UK benefits from continued membership.

Peter Wilding, director of the CBIE, will say: 'We are assembling an army of supporters to fight Europhobia and promote a reform and growth agenda that serves the British national interest. Many British people think their country is powerless in Europe.

'This is fundamentally wrong and unpatriotic. Britain helped create modern Europe, our allies want us in and it is time we finished the job.'

Details of the launch came as Tony Blair yesterday condemned plans for an in-out referendum and said Labour should make the case for staying in because it will rebuild the party’s relations with business leaders.

The former prime minister told the German magazine Der Spiegel: ‘I have difficulties with the notion that we commit now to putting a referendum question with an out option.

‘If you believe as I believe that Britain leaving Europe would be very bad for Britain, then it’s a threat that is to do yourself damage.

‘It is not good for Britain, never mind if it’s good for Europe, for us to question our membership in the EU -- and then leave that question hanging there for what could be four or five years.’ 

He added: ‘Labour should argue unequivocally for Britain to stay, it will help the party to build bridges to the business community, which is important.’

Mr Cameron won the support of 18 member states for a plan to reform the EU and the single market, which the new campaign backs.

The PM has insisted he will vote with his ‘heart and soul’ to keep Britain in the EU if he gets a better deal.

But the polls are split on whether voters would choose to stay in or sever all ties with Brussels. The UK Independence Party has seen its popularity soar in recent months.

Tory Chancellor George Osborne has made clear his intention to make the EU referendum a key dividing line at the 2015 general election.

He claimed Labour and the Liberal Democrats ‘do 
not trust’ the British people with having a say on Europe.

Today it was claimed Labour leader Ed Miliband had been talked out of promising an in-out referendum by his brother David, a former foreign secretary.

A senior Labour figure claimed Ed vetoed the idea after David said it was 'too populist', The Sun reported.

However, Labour's policy chief Jon Cruddas has long-argued for a referendum and is pushing Ed Miliband to change his mind.
