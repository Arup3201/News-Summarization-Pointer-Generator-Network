A patient felt 'sick in the stomach' when she learnt she had potentially been exposed to HIV during a medical procedure in a Victorian town.

Almost 400 people in a Gippsland town - in the state's east - have been asked to undergo precautionary HIV testing after a local healthcare worker was found to have contracted the virus.

The Age reported the Victorian health department had written to patients who had been in contact with the worker who was believed to be a dentist.

Patients in a Gippsland town may have contracted HIV from a dentist who has the disease at an eastern Victoria hospital

A patient at the hospital, identified only as 'Liz', said the letter asked her to get a blood test for the disease.

'(I felt) pretty sick actually, very sick in the stomach,' she told Fairfax radio on Tuesday.

'You wake up in the morning and then go to bed at night thinking you might be infected.'

Liz said her test results were not back yet.

'I don't know where I (may have) got it because it's all very secret at the moment,' she said.

Health Minister David Davis said the tests were precautionary, as the possibility of contracting HIV was very low.

'As I understand it the latest numbers are, of the 399, contact has been made with 248, 88 have had tests and all of those tests have been negative,' Mr Davis told reporters.

Mr Davis would not say which town was involved, saying only it was in the state's east.

'What I can say is a health professional was detected with HIV, they have ceased practising,' Mr Davis said.

'I can indicate that in this town there are 399 people who are (involved) in a careful look-back process by the chief health officer.

'They have been sent individual letters, phone calls are following.'

Victoria's chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said the health care worker, who stopped undertaking procedures after being diagnosed, was co-operating fully with the department.

'While the news may be a surprise to the patients we have contacted, I would like to reassure them there is no need for undue concern,' Dr Lester said in a statement.

'A team of specialist public health staff is on hand to provide advice to each of the patients.'

The identity of the health care worker involved or any details around which procedure led to potential exposure cannot be revealed for legal reasons.

But the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency said no further action would be taken against the healthcare worker.

'The practitioner has advised their national board of their blood borne status,' the agency's website said.

'The board has reviewed this matter and determined that the practitioner has complied and will comply with the CDNA [Communicable Diseases Network Australia] guidance, and therefore poses no risk to the public that needed to be managed.'

HIV is a blood-borne virus spread through unsafe sex with an infected person, and less frequently through blood-to-blood incidents such as needle stick injuries.

By law, all HIV cases must be reported to the Department of Health.

Mr Davis said counselling was being offered to those affected, and the testing is free.
