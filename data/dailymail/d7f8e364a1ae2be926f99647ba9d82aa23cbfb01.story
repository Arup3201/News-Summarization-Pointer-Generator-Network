A leafy idyll nicknamed Britain's Beverly Hills, which is home to Elton John, Gary Lineker and Jenson Button, pays more income tax than any other area of the UK, it was revealed today.

The tax man receives £1.18billon a year from residents of Elmbridge, twice the amount drawn from Cardiff and Newcastle combined, and 200 times more than from Google.

Its nearest rival is Glasgow, whose 600,000 residents pay £220million less in income tax than the 130,000 people living in the 37.2 square mile area south-west of London.

Tax yield: Elmbridge's 130,000 residents pay exceptional levels of tax even when compared to Britain's major cities

Luxurious: The riverside homes in Elmbridge, which is west of London, has attracted Britain's richest people and pays more income tax than any other area of the UK

Stars: Gary Lineker and his wife Danielle, as well as musicians like Ronnie Wood have made Elmbridge borough their home

Elmbridge's famous residents moved along the Thames to get away from the capital, and live in and around its principal towns of Esher, Walton on Thames and Weybridge.

Those include Jamie Redknapp and his wife Louise, Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, broadcaster Chris Tarrant, tennis player Andy Murray and footballers John Terry and Frank Lampard.

Their income tax bills help put Elmbridge at number one in the UK, followed by Glasgow on £898million, Sheffield on £812million, oil and gas-rich Aberdeen's £728million, Cardiff's £589million and Newcastle's £443million, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.

The figures show the scale of the north-south wealth divide, with the top ten all in the south-east of Britain.

'There is a growing
regional mismatch, with wealth and tax bills 
becoming concentrated within a handful of cities home to lucrative 
industries, or a collection of leafy suburbs,'  Head of Private Client Services Mark Giddens said.

'Governments have attempted to boost the 
attractiveness of other regions in the UK to top earners, even 
encouraging some public sector organisations to relocate to different 
parts of the UK. However, the pull of the South East, culturally, 
politically, and financially is still very strong for the highest 
earners.

'People assume that foreign High Net Worths live exclusively in 
Knightsbridge and Chelsea, but actually the figures suggest many have 
moved out into Surrey.'

Struggling: The average person in Hull (pictured) pays around £2,500 in income tax, when Elmbridge residents pay £16,100

Elmbridge's residents pay an average of £16,100 in tax per year, £11,702 higher than the UK average of £4,398, says UHY Hacker Young, the national accountancy group.

At the bottom was Blackpool, whose population pay £2,490 annually, which is on a par with Stoke-on-Trent and just behind Kingston-upon-Hull on  £2,560.

On average people moving to Elmbridge pay £378,823 for a home, twice the national average of £164,000, and has 11 streets in the most expensive places to buy a house in the UK.

Even the weather is better with less rainfall than the national average and also more sunshine than most of the UK.

John O'Reilly, the Tory leader of Elmbridge Council, said: 'This is a good community, a diverse community and, like every resident in the country, we should pay what is due.

'And if we are doing our bit, it is not unreasonable to expect Google to do its bit.

'As a Conservative, I favour lower rates of tax, but what rates there are should be adhered to. If our residents are the most conscientious in the country, then that's great.'
