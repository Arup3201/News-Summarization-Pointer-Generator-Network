With the swollen Thames already flooding homes, and thousands more at risk this week might not have been the best time to launch plans for outdoor swimming pools along the river.

Thousands of homes have either already flooded or are at risk of doing so, with the Thames bursting its banks in both Berkshire and Surrey.

And yet developers have chosen this week to launch their scheme for public swimming areas along the river in London.

Fancy a dip: This scheme to build swimming pools in the Thames was launched in the same week that hundreds of homes were flooded by the river

Location: This pool would be situated at Blackfriars Bridge, close to a proposed super sewer vent

Architects Studio Octopi, the designers behind the scheme say the 25metre pools, would offer users a place to exercise, but would also provide a 'habitat for fish, birds and a wide range of flora.'

'The improvements in water quality open the possibility for once again swimming in the tidal Thames,' said Chris Romer-Lee of Studio Octopi.

'These proposals look to re-establish this intimate and playful link between Londoners and the historic lifeblood of the city. Londoners have an opportunity to reclaim ownership of their largest outdoor public space.'

The fixed pools would be split across two levels and sit on a concrete slab suspended on the steel frame, while the second adjoining floating structure would be free to rise and fall with the tide.

As the supporting structure weathers, the designers hope it would be colonised by algae, ferns and saline plants such as sea beet and sea aster, while the pool itself would also be home to salt marsh species such as rushes and water plantains.

Over the next 10 years Thames Water is planning major improvements to the London sewer system, including so-called new super sewers.

The current system, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, opened in 1865 and 150 years later the sewers are running at full capacity.

In 2012, 57 combined sewer overflows discharged 39 million tonnes of sewage into the River Thames.

The designers behind the scheme have earmarked the Thames Baths Project for the sites of the proposed Super Sewer vents: Shadwell in the east of the 
city and Blackfriars Bridge in central London. 

'Our scheme doesn’t rely on the Super Sewer it relies on the government 
taking action and commissioning a clean-up programme for the Thames as 
the (existing) Bazalgette sewers are near capacity,' said Mr Romer-Lee.

He added: 'The Blackfriars site was chosen for both the Super Sewer 
vent but also because of its proximity to both the City of London and 
London’s cultural quarter (Southbank, Tate etc). I love places in cities
 that are not defined by one profession/type; where City workers, 
tourists, the arts, sport and leisure are all mixed up.

Funding: The designers are considering using crowdfunding to finance the scheme, as with a similar project in New York, as well as looking for individual investors

'We are 
still meeting lots of people in connection to the proposals to 
understand where we will go from here. We’ve had such a positive 
response it has renewed momentum.'

Asked about the project being launched in the same week that much of the Thames flooded Mr Romer-Lee said that the flooding highlighted the need for action to be taken on the current sewer system serving London.

'This is one of many major infrastructure projects that need to occur to look after our beloved city,' he said.

The designers are considering using crowdfunding to finance the scheme, as with a similar project in New York, as well as looking for individual investors.

The project is a collaboration between Studio Octopi, engineers Civic Engineers and Jonathan Cook Landscape Architects, who were chosen to conceive visions for the Thames as part of The Architecture Foundation’s programme ‘London As It Could Be Now’ project.

The teams were encouraged to explore ideas that increased interaction with the waterway and raised awareness of this important artery running through the Capital.
