Ravel Morrison posted a cryptic tweet on Wednesday night as speculation grows over his future at West Ham.

The midfielder, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Queens Park Rangers, is recovering from minor groin surgery.

But he took to Twitter to say: ‘Decisions, decisions’ as he recuperates while his Hammers team-mates are on tour in New Zealand.

Uncertain future: Ravel Morrison could yet find himself on the way out from West Ham this summer

Cryptic message: Morrison posted this message in the early hours on Thursday morning, fuelling talk he is set to leave Upton Park

Morrison has one year left on his contract at Upton Park and has been spending time at St George’s Park as he bids to be ready for the new campaign.

He started last season superbly in the Premier League and scored the Hammers Goal of the Season against Tottenham in November, but fell out of favour soon afterwards.

Interest: Morrison helped QPR win promotion to the Premier League during a successful loan spell last season

Six goals in 17 appearances helped QPR win promotion from the Championship via the play-offs.

The 21-year-old is expected to begin his pre-season when Sam Allardyce’s squad return to London.

West Ham take on Sydney FC on Saturday before facing Schalke in Germany a week later.

Man in charge: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce must decide whether Morrison will play a part of his plans
