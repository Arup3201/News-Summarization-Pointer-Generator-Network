A terrified woman was forced to make a desperate 999 call while locked in a bathroom as neighbours fatally stabbed her cousin to death in the next room.

Half-brothers Gavin Harris, 39, an ex-soldier, and  Raymond Ball, 33, both of Risca, Caerphilly, stabbed epileptic neighbour Stephen 'Lammy' Lambert with kitchen knives leaving blood 'bubbling' from their victim's chest, a court heard.

Today they were jailed for life for hacking their neighbour to death 'like a piece of meat' following the drunken row.

Raymond Ball (pictured right) lived on the same street as victim Stephen Lambert - he and his brother Gavin Harris (left) fatally stabbed their epileptic neighbour to death following a row at Mr Lambert's home in Risca

A court heard Mr Lambert had fallen out with the half-brothers and asked them to leave his flat. The pair then grabbed knives, stabbing him five times and leaving him with fatal wound

When police arrived they found Mr Lambert, 36, lying on a settee saturated in his blood. 

He told them, 'I can't breathe,' as they fought to save his life.

Prosecutor Peter Rouch QC told Cardiff Crown Court: 'The blood was bubbling from a stab wound to his chest as they went in.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard how the trio had been drinking together and listening to music shortly before the brutal attack. 

During the attack, on August 27 last year at the victim's home in Risca, Mr Lambert's terrified cousin Louise Whatley told an operator in a harrowing 999 call: 'Two men are stabbing him with knives and I've locked myself in the bathroom.'

She watched the pair 'hacking at Stephen Lambert like a piece of meat' before locking herself in the toilet and phoning 999.

Prosecutor Peter Rouch QC said: 'The call was taped and it's a harrowing call

 'Mr Lambert could be heard coughing, groaning and crying out in the background.

'She went back out when the two left and tried to stop the bleeding and comfort him, saying to the operator, "He sounds as if he is really hurting."

Mr Lambert was unresponsive and unconscious when he arrived at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport with stab wounds to his chest, right arm and thigh.

Doctors attempted a major 'clamshell' surgical procedure, used only in extreme emergencies, and opened up his body through skin, muscle, rib cage and diaphragm, but he could not be saved.

The fatal chest wound was 10cm deep and had gone through his ribs and an artery while a second 11cm-deep wound in his leg had partially severed a vein, the prosecutor said.

Violence started  after the group indulged in an evening of drinking from three-litre bottles of cider.

Harris and Ball, who told police Mr Lambert had been his best friend, had earlier been seen with knives tucked into their waistbands after a separate incident.

They were seen putting the weapons behind cushions when they went to Mr Lambert's home.

One witness said Ball was 'drunk, hyper and acting macho'.

The court heard Mr Lambert  told Ball to leave before a struggle began between Mr Lambert and Ball, as Harris tried pull them apart.

Mr Rouch said Ball then ran to the kitchen and searched the drawers before grabbing a blade from the draining board.

'When he returned screaming, 'I'm going to stab you,' Ms Whatley went into shock and froze as she saw the knife 'ramming down' towards her cousin's leg,' said Mr Rouch.

'As he shouted, 'Stop it,' she saw blood on the blade.'

Harris was then said to have gone to the cushion where he had hidden his knife and picked it up.

'Both of them, then with knives, were stabbing at him', Mr Rouch said. 'Louise Whatley locked herself in the bathroom and dialled 999.'

Ms Whatley told police Mr Lambert was 'like a brother' to her. 

In a victim impact statement she said: 'It was horrific. I have horrible flashbacks and nightmares.'

After the attack the brothers were at another flat where Ball told a man: 'I've just stabbed Lambert.' 

Harris and Ball both admitted murder.

Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies DBE said: 'This was a frenzied attack on a defenceless man.

'Nothing Stephen Lambert said or did should have led to this vicious and senseless stabbing.

'The victim was in his own home where he was entitled to feel safe.

'The horrific attack was witnessed by his cousin.'

Harris was jailed for 21 years and eight months, Ball was jailed for 22 years and six months.
