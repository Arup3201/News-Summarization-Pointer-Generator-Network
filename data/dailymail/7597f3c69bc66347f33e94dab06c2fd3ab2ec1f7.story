Deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was today released from prison and taken to hospital.

The release of Mubarak from Tora jail in Cairo comes after a week of bloody turmoil in which Egypt's new army-backed rulers cracked down on ousted President Mohamed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.

Mubarak was immediately taken to an armed forces' hospital north-east of Cairo, where he will remain under guard, according to remarks by his lawyer confirmed by medical and security sources.

The prime minister's office said 
85-year-old Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until he was 
overthrown in 2011 as uprisings swept the Arab world, would be placed 
under house arrest.

That 
decision was made under a month-long state of emergency declared last 
week when police stormed protest camps set up in Cairo by the Islamist 
movement to demand Mr Morsi's reinstatement.

About
900 people, including some 100 soldiers and police, have been killed in
violence across Egypt since then, making it the bloodiest bout of 
internal strife in the republic's history.

Mubarak's
release will play to the Brotherhood's claim that the military is 
trying to rehabilitate the old order. The army-installed government 
casts its conflict with the Islamists as a fight against terrorism.

In
the latest violence, gunmen in a car killed an army major and a soldier
in an attack on a patrol near the city of Ismailia on the Suez Canal, 
security sources said today. Two soldiers were wounded.

Mubarak was sentenced to life in 
prison last year for failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators. 
But a court accepted his appeal earlier this year and ordered a retrial.

'Mubarak is a man who destroyed this country. And now he's going to walk free?'

This week, two court rulings in separate corruption cases removed the last legal grounds for his continued detention.

Mubarak
is still being retried on charges of complicity in the killing of 
protesters during the revolt against him, but he has already served the 
maximum pre-trial detention in that case.

The ailing former air force commander will not be allowed to leave Egypt and his assets remain frozen. But Mubarak's
imminent release has dismayed some Egyptians.

A man who said he was trying to find 
out if his brother, arrested on Saturday, was in Tora prison, said: 
‘Mubarak is a man who destroyed this country. And now he's going to walk
free?’

‘Egypt is on the 
brink, and God knows where we are going,’ said the man, who would not 
give his name, but called himself a Morsi supporter - although not a 
member of the Muslim Brotherhood.

He
was among about 75 people lining up at the prison gate in the heat to 
visit relatives inside. Across from the gate, a score of visiting 
relatives sat in the shade along a prison wall, waiting their turn.

‘We love Mubarak,’ said Mohamed Hussein, 36, who has no job. His sister Fatheya added: ‘Isn't it enough that for 30 years he did not drag us into a war, and let us live in dignity?’
