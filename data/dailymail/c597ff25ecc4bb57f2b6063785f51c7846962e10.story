Arsenal's FA Cup Final celebrations took a toll on the players as they were out for the count on the team bus on Sunday.

Snapped by forward Lukas Podolski, Gunners team-mates Jack Wilshere, Thomas Vermaelen, Wojciech Sczcsesny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were all caught on camera fast asleep.

Podolski, who started for Arsenal during the Wembley showpiece, uploaded the pictures onto his Instagram account which also includes Emiliano Viviano, Yaya Sanogo and Abou Diaby after their victory parade through Islington.

The 28-year-old was in high spirits during Arsenal's celebrations, evening jokingly hiding the FA Cup under a table much to the panic of staff during their Inslington Town Hall reception.
