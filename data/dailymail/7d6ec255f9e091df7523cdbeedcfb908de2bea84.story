 A Morris dancer who falsely claimed more than £28,000 in benefits after saying he was barely able to walk has escaped jail.

Allan Baldwin, of Lockerbie in Scotland said that from 2008 until 2013 he had extreme difficulty in walking and claimed the highest rate of Disability Living Allowance.

Today at Preston Crown Court he was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and order to perform 200 hours of unpaid work. There was no order for costs and he did not have to pay a victim surcharge.

Baldwin was a member of the Solway Morris Group and although is primary function was a musician, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) obtained footage showing that he also took part in the dancing.

In addition, the investigation established that various events the group took part in would have involved him walking for several miles.

Benefit cheat Allan Baldwin seems to have no difficulty moving here despite claiming the highest level of disability benefit

Baldwin pleaded guilty to the offence at a previous hearing at Preston Crown Court on June 16.

Jane Baker, DWP Fraud Manager in the North West, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.'
