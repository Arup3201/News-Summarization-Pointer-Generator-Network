Arrested: 22-year-old mother Kelsey James was arrested after she drunkenly passed out in a bar and left her 2-year-old child alone in a parked car

Police in Connecticut say a toddler spent the night in a car outside a bar after her mother went drinking and ended up in the hospital.

According to Bristol police, the two-year-old girl was found asleep Saturday morning inside the locked vehicle in Bristol after her mother, Kelsey James, 22, was taken to hospital for treatment after passing out at a bar. 

James awoke almost six hours later and began asking hospital staff for her daughter.  

Officers arrived at the City Sports Grille at 177 Farmington Avenue at about 11:56pm Friday after staff reported a woman who was 'intoxicated and incapacitated,' reports NBC Connecticut.

'Apparently talking to her, she was very incoherent. She tried to break into a car that wasn't hers. At that point we called police in fear for her safety,' Ron Philbrick, general manager at City Sports Bar, told WFSB.

Staff said she'd arrived around 11pm and was refused alcohol. She was given a glass of water and then ran out into the parking lot.

'The fact that she drove here. I don't even know how she drove here. It amazed me because her eyes were barely open,' bartender Courtney Lausier told WFSB.

Emergency responders took James to a hospital for treatment and evaluation.

At about 5:30am, hospital staff called police to say James was awake and asking where her daughter was.

Intoxicated: Bar staff say Kelsey James drove to the City Sports Grille but was refused alcohol and was then taken to hospital around midnight before waking up almost six hours later and asking for her daughter 

Police then located James' car with the little girl asleep inside.

James is charged with risking injury to a minor and leaving an unsupervised child in a vehicle.

Connecticut's child welfare agency is investigating and will care for the girl until further notice.

James was released after posting $50,000 bail and will appear in Bristol Superior Court on September 2.

Neighbors told WFSB they were shocked and that James is a good mother.

'Kelsey is a wonderful young girl; has a baby, is very responsible. The family is wonderful,' Pam Drzewiecki said.
