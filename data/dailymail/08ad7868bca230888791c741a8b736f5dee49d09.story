A woman is accusing Ashton Kutcher of cheating on wife Demi Moore, the same weekend as the couple celebrated their six year wedding anniversary, according to Radaronline.

The entertainment website claims the liaison happened last Friday in San Diego, California, after a alcohol-fuelled night out at Fluxx bar with his former That '70s Show co-star Danny Masterson.

The  23-year-old woman, who has not been identified, has reportedly hired a high powered Hollywood attorney and has gone into hiding.

Cheating scandal: A new report claims Demi Moore's husband Ashton Kutcher hooked up with a 23-year-old woman last weekend

Radar Online says it received the information from 'multiple friends of the woman.'

According to one unnamed source: 'She is due to meet with an attorney tonight (Tuesday). She is freaking out.'

The Two and a Half Men star's wedding anniversary was on Saturday, September 24, one day after the alleged encounter happened.

'Ashton didn't look like someone who was celebrating a wedding anniversary,' one club goer told RadarOnline.

Bad timing: The scandal has erupted just one week after Ashton's high profile debut on Two and a Half Men

Moore seemed to hint at trouble on her Twitter page by sharing a quote from Greek philosopher Epictetus.

On
September 23, she wrote: 'When we are offended at any man's fault, turn
to yourself & study your own failings. Then you will forget your 
anger.'

The scandal 
also comes as Star magazine, a sister publication of RadarOnline, 
released an explosive new report claiming the marriage between Ashton, 
33, and Demi, 48, is 'officially over.'

According to Star: 'Ashton and Demi have separated and the marriage is over.'

MailOnline contacted Ashton's representatives, but so far they have not responded.

A
source close to the pair reportedly told Star magazine: 'The 
relationship ended because of Ashton's serial cheating. It's a painful 
time for Demi.'

In
September 2010, as Mailonline previously reported, Ashton was rocked by
another cheating scandal after Star reported that he had had a fling 
with a 21-year-old woman named Brittney Jones.

The young woman told the magazine she had sex with the actor inside the Beverly Hills home he shares with his wife.

The
magazine also claimed that Ashton was so worried that the alleged 
affair would be exposed that he made her delete their text messages, but
Star reported that she didn't remove all of them.

Brittney
told Star: 'He looked over the texts and said he wanted me to delete 
all the messages from him,' she revealed. 'He then told me he wanted me 
to delete the texts I had sent to him. He said they could hurt him.'

Despite
the explosive report, Ashton and Demi brushed off the allegations with 
Ashton making sure to express just how he felt by taking his Twitter to 
make a statement.

He said, 'I think Star magazine calling me a 'cheater' qualifies as defamation of character. I hope my lawyer agrees.

'STAR magazine - you don't get to stand behind "freedom of the press" when you are writing fiction.'

Kutcher's representative also denied the story, while his wife of nearly five years came out in support of her husband.

'Excellent point my love!' and 'No question!' she wrote in response to Kutcher's comments.
