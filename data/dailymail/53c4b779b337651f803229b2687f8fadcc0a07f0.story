Chelsea's lead at the top of the Premier League ladder is now seven points after their 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. 

Emre Can struck first for the Reds as those left out mid-week in their loss to Real Madrid returned but Brendan Rodgers gamble didn't pay off as Gary Cahill and Diego Costa clinched the win for Jose Mourinho's side. 

Sportsmail's Dominic King was at Anfield and rates all the players' performances.  

Nemanja Matic was the pick of Chelsea's players as they claimed three points at Liverpool

LIVERPOOL

Simon Mignolet: Set the ball rolling for Liverpool’s goal but questions over him for the two that were conceded. Confidence still looks shaky. 6

Glen Johnson: One of those who missed out in Madrid, returned without any fuss. Couldn’t find any fault in his efforts. 7

Martin Skrtel: Had a running battle with Diego Costa and seemed to have him under control until the Spaniard wriggled away at the crucial moment. 7

Dejan Lovren: Perhaps fortunate to start after Kolo Toure did so well in Madrid; some good moments, other parts lacked conviction. 6

Alberto Moreno: Excellent in the Bernabeu but dropped a level here. Could he have made more effort to block Costa’s path to goal? 6

Steven Gerrard: Desperate to make up for what happened in April, should have won Liverpool a penalty with a late shot. Drove his team forward. 7

Raheem Sterling: Bizarrely booked for colliding with Ramires; a willing outlet but had to make much of his own opportunities. 6.5

Emre Can: Kept his place after doing well in Madrid and was at the heart of Liverpool’s best moments early on, scoring their goal. 7

Jordan Henderson: Work rate and energy never in question. One chance blocked at the end, tried too hard to make something happen. 6.5

Philippe Coutinho: A few nice touches, one driving run but was weak for Chelsea’s second goal and didn’t get in the game enough. 5.5

Mario Balotelli: Some selfless runs early on but then his impact fizzled out. Booked for a stupid foul on Oscar in second half. 5.5

Subs: Allen 6 (for Can 70), Borini 6 (for Coutinho 70), Lambert (for Balotelli 79)

Unused: Jones, K Toure, Lallana, Lucas

CHELSEA 

Thibaut Courtois: Wrong-footed for the goal that he conceded but otherwise never put a glove out of place; one fine stop from Sterling. 7.5

Branislav Ivanovic: Every successful team needs a player like this teak-tough Serb. Does his job immaculately every week.7.5

John Terry: Will never win a popularity contest but is still the best English central defender in the country. Never in trouble. 8

Gary Cahill celebrates scoring Chelsea's equaliser after goal line technology made the decision in their favour

Gary Cahill: Playing alongside Terry has helped him mature into a defender of the highest calibre; lucky to get away with a late handball. 7.5

Cesar Azpilicueta: Another who doesn’t get headlines but does a crucial job; superb run and cross created the winner for Costa. 8

Cesc Fabregas: Game passed him by for large periods. Only seen him when he was complaining to the referee. 5.5

Nemanja Matic: Never fails to impress. He gave the team talk before hand and led by example during the game. Outstanding. 8.5

Usually the pass master, this was a match which largely passed Fabregas by

Ramires: Like Fabregas, struggled to making an impression going forward. Worked hard but eventually substituted. 6

Eden Hazard: Took the breath away at times with his speed, balance and skill. Always had Liverpool when on the ball. 8

Oscar: A couple of neat touches, kept play ticking over smoothly and never stopped running but booked for a wild lunge at Glen Johnson. 7

Diego Costa: Makes things happen and scores the goals when they are needed; another one to take Chelsea closer to the title. 8

Subs: Willian 6.5 (for Ramires 54), Drogba (for Costa 90) Filipe Luis (for Hazard 90)
