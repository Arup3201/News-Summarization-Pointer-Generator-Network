Major League Baseball today said it would waive the confidentiality clause in its drug testing program to release all documents relating to treatment of beleaguered Yankees player, Alex Rodriguez, as his lawyer insisted he will not serve a single inning of his 211-match ban.

Attorney Joe Tacopina was presented with a letter from MLB on the Today show stating that it was prepared to release the information and host Matt Lauer asked the lawyer to sign it.

'We would love nothing more than to discuss his testing history,' Tacopina responded, saying the investigation had been 'rife with misconduct'.

But on Monday afternoon, he rejected the offer, even though the letter stated that Rodriguez's side could also disclose all documents they wanted. He called it a 'publicity stunt' and a 'trap'.

Speaking out: Alex Rodriguez's lawyer Joe Tacopino said his client should not serve a single inning of his 211-match ban because evidence against him using performance-enhancing drugs will not stand up in court

Tacopina and A-Rod have been accused of 
using the confidentiality agreement as a barrier put up to avoid 
answering whether or not he took performance-enhancing drugs.

It comes as an alleged former mistress of Yankee's boss Brian Cashman claimed he knew about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it in explosive court papers filed today.

MLB said it would readily release information on A-Rod's prior violations, communications, text messages and instant messages related to his treatment by Anthony Bosch, who founded the Miami-based Biogenesis anti-aging clinic linked to performing-enhancing drugs.

A-Rod has been served a 211-game ban for taking the drugs, but he remains on the field while appealing the decision. All 13 other players accused of the drug use have accepted their bans.

Stubborn: Tacopino did not say if he would sign a letter from MLB to waive confidentiality of the drug testing

Speaking to Today, Tacopina also took
aim at the Yankees, accusing its management of purposefully keeping his
client in the dark about his ailing health.

He
presented an MRI scan to the show which he claimed would reveal that 
A-Rod had a hole in his left hip on October 11, 2012, which he claimed 
the Yankees did not tell his client.

'Nobody told Alex Rodriguez that he 
had a hole in his left hip - nobody,' Tacopina said. 'He didn't know 
until he went to his own doctor.'

Lauer said an independent doctor was looking at the scan.

Tacopina admitted he did not know why the team would purposefully withhold the medical information, but suggested they wanted to make him a 'scapegoat'.

Controversy: Alex Rodriguez, pictured at Sunday's Yankees Red Sox game, has been banned from playing for 211 games but is still allowed on the field while he appeals the ban

Claims: Yankees boss Brian Cashman's alleged mistress Louise Meanwell said he was aware of the steroid use

Court papers filed today allege that Yankee’s boss Brian Cashman knew about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it, instead adopting a ‘win-at-any-cost’ attitude.

The papers were filed on behalf of Louise Meanwell, who allegedly had an affair with Cashman in late 2011 while he was still married. Meanwell claimed she fell pregnant with his child at the time and he paid for an abortion. He, in turn, accused her of stalking him and extorting $6,000 to keep quiet about their relationship.

She was arraigned on grand larceny, stalking and harassment charges in February 2012 and spent five months in Rikers Island prison.

The British native claims Cashman told her of steroid use within the Yankees, naming specific players, and admitted intentionally misleading federal investigators during the Roger Clemen’s investigation, according to court papers.

It also states: ‘Mr Cashman was ambivalent to the use of performance enhancing drugs so long as nothing came back to the Yankee’s organization…and shared with [Meanwell] his win-at-any-cost attitude.’

The papers were filed citing a conflict of interest because Alex Rodriguez’s lawyer Joe Tacopino and Meanwell’s lawyer Stephen Turano form the law offices of  Tacopina Seigel & Turano, P.C. 

The papers order Tacopino to stop representing the Yankee's player because Meanwell should have been consulted prior to agreeing to represent him.

Meanwell said she relayed all of the details of her conversations with Cashman to Turano and was not informed when the firm started representing Rodriguez, who denies using performance-enhancing drugs. 

The papers state: ‘Mr Rodriguez and his current circumstance is consistent with a New York Yankee management takedown, as was in the case of [Meanwell].

'While it appears the Yankee organization is attempting to get out from under a $100million obligation to Rodriguez, Meanwell’s interests are not so consistent with the baseball player’s as for her to give consent to the law firm to represent Rodriguez’s possible divergent interests.'

He previously said that 
Yankees' president Randy Levine told Dr Bryan Kelly, who performed hip 
surgery on Rodriguez in January, that he didn't 'ever want to see him on
the field again', the New York Daily News reported.

He
said that Levine wanted the Yankees to collect insurance on the $114 
million that remains on Rodriguez's contract before the 2013 season 
began.

'I know that our medical staff did 
everything they possibly can to assist Alex, help Alex, diagnose Alex 
and give him the best proper medical care,' Yankees General Manager 
Brian Cashman has said.

On Monday, Tacopina added that evidence 
against his client would not stand up in a court and that MLB was simply
'perverting the process'.

'Alex Rodriguez will be found not responsible,' he said. 'To the degree he will not be made to serve one game suspension.

'I know the evidence against Alex 
Rodriguez and it will never stand up in a court of law because it relies
on one person - Anthony Bosch... He has no credibility, He has no 
ability.'

He added of his 
client: 'If I were to advise him, I would say don't take one inning out.
That being said, that's his decision to make.'

about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it, instead 
adopting a ‘win-at-any-cost’ attitude.

performance-enhancing drugs.

The

get out from under a $100million obligation to Rodriguez, Meanwell’s 
interests are not so consistent with the baseball player’s as for her to
give consent to the law firm to represent Rodriguez’s possible 
divergent interests.

The appearance by Tacopina comes just
hours after a tense performance by A-Rod on Sunday, in which he was hit
by a fastball from Boston Red Sox starter Ryan Demptser.

A-Rod
responded by hitting his 649th career home run, prompting even more 
boos and derisive chants from spectators reeling from the accusations 
against him.

Dempster appeared to take aim at Rodriguez and both teams were given a warning.

Rodriguez, 38, has been condemned by fans and the MLB for appealing which has allowed him to carry on playing for the Yankees.

Yankees
fans are also concerned he will prove an embarrassment as the season 
goes on, especially as he is on 10-year, $275million contract that will 
see him play for the team through the 2016 season.

Rodriguez
has previously admitted to using performance enhancing drugs between 
2001 and 2003 when he played with the Texas Rangers.

Beleaguered: A-Rod has enraged fans by refusing to accept the ban for allegedly taking the drugs

Rodriguez has consistently denied using banned drugs linked to Bosch and says he has never been treated by him.

In a statement his lawyer David 
Cornwell said: 'The allegations are untrue and are another attempt to 
harm Alex - this time by driving a wedge between Alex and other players 
in the game.

'While 
Alex focuses on baseball and repeatedly states that he is going to 
respect the appeal process, the drumbeat of false allegations 
continues.’

In his latest 
comments on the scandal, MLB commissioner Bud Siegel said that he was 
‘very comfortable’ with the way its investigation had gone.

He
said: ‘I have a job to do, and the job is to protect the integrity of 
the sport and enforce our program, and that's what I'm going to do.

‘We
made a commitment, and I made a commitment to a lot of people and a lot
of entities, that we would do everything we can to clean up this sport.
We have, we will and we will continue to do so.’

Other
major leaguers also have spoken out, criticizing players penalized for 
using performance-enhancing drugs for the damage they've done to 
baseball. Boston pitcher John Lackey recently said he had a problem with
Rodriguez being allowed to play while his suspension is under appeal.
