An American student has proven that holidaymakers don’t require a six-figure salary in order to travel around the world.

Shirine Taylor survives off just £2,000 while touring some of the world’s most fascinating destinations on the seat of her bicycle.

The 21-year-old, from Oregon, has had the adventure of a lifetime while cooking dinner over an open fire in Georgia and staying with a local family in a roadside slum in India.

An approximate breakdown of costs for Shirine Taylor:

Shirine has travelled more than 7,000 miles with her boyfriend, Kevin, while limiting herself to an average budget of up to £6.50 a day (including the cost of the initial flights and other expenses, including food, bicycle maintenance and toilet paper).

She is also relying on freebies from strangers she meets along the way or monetary donations through her blog.

Shirine and her partner have been on the road for 17 months and are currently touring Turkey.

She said: ‘I'm an energetic and happy young gal with a passion for adventure, the mountains, and life on the road.

‘I've always loved nature and the adventures which come along with it - skiing, mountaineering, cycling, and trekking.

‘I've always been very curious about our world and how other people live in it. After just one year of university I decided that my formal education could wait. So I set off at twenty years old to cycle around the world.’

‘The decision to leave came naturally to me as I strongly believe that the only way to live your life is to live the life of your dreams.’

Shirine embarked on her epic journey in July last year and her five-figure budget includes her flights to India and Georgia, visas and vaccines.

She wakes every day at sunrise, cycles six hours per day and sleeps, washes and cooks in the open air.

She said: ‘I have kept my costs low by simply realising that I don't need a whole lot of money.

‘I live nearly every single night in my tent, except for when I occasional arrange to stay with someone in a larger city when I can't camp.

The student, who has started to accept donations from her blog readers, says she believes that travel is 'the best form of education'

‘I have also worked in many different hostels for a free room, and I have been taken in by hospitable and amazing families.

‘I eat local foods, street foods in cheap countries such as India, and lots of bread, local produce, and pasta everywhere else.

‘By living in my tent and cooking for myself I am able to live as cheaply as I please.’

It has been a challenging journey with a dangerous and dramatic trek through India’s Spiti Valley, a Himalayan region with some of the world’s highest and most difficult roads to travel in.

However, Shrine maintains the secret to continuing her shoe-string trip is keeping her good humour.

Shrine Taylor likens her shoe-string trip to a television sitcom and says the secret to continuing it is keeping her good humour

She likened the trip to a television sitcom.

‘Funny daily situations include me clucking like a chicken in small shops in order to convey through the language barrier that I would like to buy some eggs, to explaining to bewildered city folk that yes, I really do live in a tent.

‘I believe that travel is the best form of education, and I simply couldn't imagine my life without it.’
