They are remembered as the 'noble six hundred' who rode 'into the mouth of Hell' with unwavering valour in one of the British military's most infamous disasters.

The bravery and unquestioning loyalty exhibited in the doomed Charge of the Light Brigade - immortalised by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in his poem of the same name - caused a sensation in Victorian Britain when news reached home.

But it has now emerged that, even as the order was given, it was obvious to the rank and file risking their lives in the face of Russian artillery that - in Tennyson's words - 'someone had blunder'd'.

Letters written by some of the 673 soldiers involved in the ill-fated assault have been unearthed 150 years after the assault, which took place during the Crimean War in 1854.

They describe the folly of the order to charge into the famed 'Valley of Death' - surrounded on three sides by massed Russian forces - but also show how the brave English forces threw themselves into the battle nonetheless.

One correspondent referred to the order - which is thought to have been given because of a misunderstanding - as 'perfect madness'. Another, identified as Private Thomas Williams of the 11th Hussars, clearly thought the command was an accident.

Writing to his parents in England, he said: 'I could see what would be the result of it, and so could all of us; but of course, as we had got the order, it was our duty to obey.

Carnage: The Charge of the Light Brigade, in 1854, is one of Britain's most notorious military disasters

'I do not wish to boast too much; but I can safely say that there was not a man in the Light Brigade that day but what did his duty to his Queen and country.'

The correspondence was unearthed by Crimean War historian Anthony Dawson, who scoured newspaper archives to find published accounts from the soldiers involved. The full collection is due to be published this June in a book called Letters from the Light Brigade.

Among the unnamed witnesses to the carnage were an unnamed officer from the 17th Lancers, who described the unblinking loyalty of his comrades.

He wrote: 'We all knew the thing was desperate before we started, and it was even worse than we thought... However there was no hesitation, down our fellows went at a gallop - through a fire in front and on both flanks, which emptied our saddles and knocked over our horses by scores.'

Chaos: The Light Brigade was decimated by Russia artillery fire on three flanks

The charge, one of the best-known blunders in British military history, came in the thick of the Battle of Balaclava, near Sevastopol in Crimea - then part of Imperial Russia.

Although it only lasted around 20 minutes, the attack saw almost a fifth of the Light Brigade killed, and hundreds more wounded.

It is thought to have come about after Lord Lucan and the Earl of Cardigan, who were in charge of the cavalry in the battle, were given a confusing order by Lord Raglan, the British commander.

The Light Brigade had been meant to ride to the rescue of British guns which had been captured and were being dragged away by Russian forces.

But due to a misunderstanding they instead though they had been given the suicidal task of capturing well-defended Russian guns much further away.

As they rode towards the distant emplacement, their men were torn apart by Russian marksmen and shell fire. To the surprise of their foes, they did manage to reach the massed guns and inflict some damage, but were so depleted that they had to turn back and retreat.

Lord Tennyson's poem, written based on breathless newspaper dispatches from the front, memorably expressed the bravery of ordinary soldiers as they rode to their doom. It captured the public mood, and was distributed to soldiers in Crimea while they were still fighting.

Half a league, half a league/ Half a league onward,All in the valley of Death/ Rode the six hundred."Forward, the Light Brigade! / "Charge for the guns!" he said:Into the valley of Death / Rode the six hundred."Forward, the Light Brigade!" / Was there a man dismay'd?Not tho' the soldier knew / Someone had blunder'd:Theirs not to make reply, / Theirs not to reason why,Theirs but to do and die: / Into the valley of DeathRode the six hundred.Cannon to right of them, / Cannon to left of them,Cannon in front of them / Volley'd and thunder'd;Storm'd at with shot and shell, / Boldly they rode and well,Into the jaws of Death, / Into the mouth of HellRode the six hundred.Flash'd all their sabres bare, / Flash'd as they turn'd in air,Sabring the gunners there, / Charging an army, whileAll the world wonder'd: / Plunged in the battery-smokeRight thro' the line they broke; / Cossack and RussianReel'd from the sabre stroke / Shatter'd and sunder'd.Then they rode back, but not / Not the six hundred.Cannon to right of them, / Cannon to left of them,Cannon behind them / Volley'd and thunder'd;Storm'd at with shot and shell, / While horse and hero fell,They that had fought so well / Came thro' the jaws of DeathBack from the mouth of Hell, / All that was left of them,Left of six hundred.When can their glory fade? / O the wild charge they made!All the world wondered. / Honor the charge they made,Honour the Light Brigade, / Noble six hundred.

Bloody Crimean War charge in 1854 is an infamous military blunder

The Light Brigade cavalry were ordered to charge into heavy Russian fire

Now new letters reveal that ordinary soldiers knew the order was foolish

But, in their own words, they tell how the men charged on regardless
