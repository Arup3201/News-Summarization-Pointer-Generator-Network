Troubled former State of Origin player Blake Ferguson has been banned from pubs, clubs and bottleshops at his appeal hearing in Sydney.

The judge upheld Ferguson's guilt over a 2013 indecent assault charge but set aside his conviction on the provision that he stay away from alcohol outlets and seek counselling for alcohol abuse.

The 24-year-old former Canberra and Cronulla winger was convicted in December of groping a 24-year-old woman's crotch during a boozy night out at Cronulla's 2230 nightclub.

Blake Ferguson has been banned from pubs, clubs and bottleshops after trying to appeal a two-year good behaviour bond

The incident occurred on June 16, 2013 as Ferguson celebrated his selection for the NSW Origin side with state teammate, Josh Dugan.

Ferguson was handed a two-year good behaviour bond in February and immediately launched an appeal.

Sydney District Court Judge Michael Finnane on Thursday reduced Ferguson's good behaviour bond to one year. 'Alcohol is an enemy for you, not a friend,' Judge Finnane told Ferguson.

Judge Finnane said he was prepared to lessen the punishment, in part, because of Ferguson's 'deprived' and Aboriginal background.

June 26, 2014: On appeal, Ferguson was given a conditional discharge and no conviction recorded. His good behaviour bond was reduced to one year and he was banned from wholesale and retail alcohol outlets

He said he accepted Ferguson did not touch the woman on the vagina but on the upper thigh under her dress.

'Touching a woman under her dress in that area is an indecent assault, therefore I find the charge proven,' he added. 'What he did was reckless.'

Ferguson was sacked by the Raiders and dumped from the NSW Origin side last year following a string of off-field misdemeanours and a well-documented battle with alcohol.

In May he joined the Sydney Roosters in a non-playing, community and youth coaching role.

Ferguson had hoped to make a playing comeback with the Roosters next season.

The NRL said it would take Thursday's ruling and a range of other behavioural factors into account when considering any club's request to re-register him.

'We'd have to review any contract before deciding whether he was re-registered with the league,' an NRL spokesman said.

Ferguson's fall from grace has been spectacular over the past 12 months after he burst onto the scene aged 18 and in 2011 was Canberra's top try scorer.

Ferguson's lawyer Greg James QC said his client's troubles had been devastating and outlined his long battles with alcohol.

Mr James said Ferguson was trying to stay off the booze and said he had the potential to restart his playing career.

Ferguson left the court without commenting to the waiting media.
