Jose Mourinho claims Manchester United are ready to sell Wayne Rooney in the summer. READ MORE HERE

ALSO: Arsene Wenger has given his clearest indication yet that he will sign a new deal at Arsenal. READ MORE HERE

Jose Mourinho says that he believes Manchester United, whom Chelsea face Sunday will sell Wayne Rooney this summer, but only to a club outside the Premier League.

Also: The Association of Tennis Professionals, which runs the men's tour, is to discuss whether it needs to adopt a heat policy in the wake of the gruelling conditions that have dominated the first week of the Australian Open.

Jose Mourinho expects Manchester United to sell Wayne Rooney to a leading foreign club if they cannot convince him to extend his stay at Old Trafford, with Chelsea resigned to missing out on the forward, given the champions' intransigence over conducting business with a direct Premier League rival.

Also: Oh, England. So close. But still so very, very far away. There have been precious few moments of grace for England's cricketers over the past 11 weeks and they were denied one at the Gabba in the most agonising of circumstances as Alastair Cook and his team found a new and yet more painful way to lose a cricket match, snatching ignominious defeat from the jaws of what would have been a first international victory after 84 days of this traumatic tour.

West Brom are in danger of losing a Â£3 million sponsorship deal if they do not sack Nicolas Anelka over his controversial 'quenelle' gesture.

Also: Potential bidders looking to buy Southampton have already contacted the club at a time when the owner is adamant the players themselves are not for sale.

Jose Mourinho has stoked tensions before Chelsea's encounter with Manchester United tomorrow by predicting that the Barclays Premier League champions will try to sell Wayne Rooney to an overseas club at the end of the season.

Also: Like a car crash in the making, England are heading towards their worst run of results in international cricket. The opportunity squandered painfully at the Gabba yesterday represented an eighth successive defeat across formats.

David Moyes has hit back at Jose Mourinho's jibes by insisting that Wayne Rooney will not be sold in the summer.

Also: Alan Pardew has sentenced himself to community service - as penance for swearing at Manuel Pellegrini.

West Bromwich Albion's sponsor, Zoopla, last night warned the club to axe Nicolas Anelka or risk their lucrative shirt deal being scrapped.

Also: Sunderland have sacked their director of football, Roberto de Fanti, after a spell of less than seven months during which he oversaw a terrible summer recruitment drive that left the club with a weaker squad this season than the one that finished fourth from bottom last May.

Wayne Rooney will be sold in the summer, according to Jose Mourinho.

Also: Jose Mourinho has made a grovelling apology to David Moyes for sticking the boot into his rival.

Jose Mourinho last night accepted Chelsea will never get Wayne Rooney - but believes he will be sold in the summer.

Also: Andy Carroll last night revealed he would be heartbroken to miss this summer's World Cup finals.
