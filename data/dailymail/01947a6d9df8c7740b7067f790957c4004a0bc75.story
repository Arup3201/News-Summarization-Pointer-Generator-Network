A stunt on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in which a contestant’s child was used as a prize was condemned as offensive yesterday by the TV watchdog.

Regulator Ofcom said it had ‘serious concerns’ about the episode in which Charlie Brooks failed to win the chance to be reunited with her daughter Kiki, seven.

The ruling was praised by media campaigners as a ‘warning shot’ to other reality programmes not to use children in the same way.

Shocked upon realising: EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks, 31, was offered the chance to win luxuries such as food and clean clothes by opening one of five doors - not knowing her child was standing behind one

Ofcom launched an investigation into the episode in November last year after EastEnders actress Miss Brooks, 31, was offered the chance to win luxuries such as food and clean clothes by opening one of five doors – not realising her child was standing behind one.

The tearful soap star later told viewers the disappointment was ‘heartbreaking’. Kiki, who had not seen her mother for 18 days, had been ordered to stay silent but afterwards appeared distressed. At the time, ITV was accused of cruelty.

In its judgment, Ofcom said: ‘The 
appearance of a seven-year-old child placed in such a scenario would 
have gone far beyond the likely expectations of the audience.’

Ofcom accepted ITV’s claim that Kiki had exhibited disappointment rather than ‘real distress’.

It decided the broadcaster had been careful to protect her emotional welfare and said she was looked after by her grandmother while Miss Brooks was in the jungle. But the watchdog attacked the premise of the stunt, saying it would have caused a ‘significant level of offence’.

It added: ‘We considered the editorial premise of this challenge would have been potentially offensive: in effect a seven-year-old child was being offered as a prize.’

Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘We will never know exactly how upset the child was. But it was deeply inappropriate to use a child as a prize.

‘I’m not surprised viewers were upset to see a daughter being dangled in front of her mother like that. I hope other reality shows take this as a warning shot.’

A spokesman for Miss Brooks declined to comment.

The BBC was also rebuked over its treatment of children by Ofcom after a girl of 11 vomited during a TV eating competition on Dick and Dom’s Hoopla! on CBBC.

Two youngsters were made to drink a blend of custard, mayonnaise, spaghetti hoops and apple sauce and one of them was sick in a bucket.

Ofcom found the BBC had failed to protect the girl’s emotional welfare and said the clip, screened last November, was offensive because it appeared she was put under ‘inappropriate pressure’ and was distressed.

Ofcom said a meeting to discuss the welfare of child participants on the BBC had been postponed until the conclusion of the CBBC inquiry, but that it would now take place.
