John van Wisse, 41, from Melbourne has smashed the world record for the Arch to Arc race

At 5.45am on Friday, Melbourne time, Mr John van Wisse finally crossed the finish line after 61 hours and 27 minutes.

Mr Van Wisse told the 3AW breakfast show just after finishing the race that he was ecstatic with the result.

'I've done some brutal training and it's been a year's build-up and I'm just absolutely stoked,' he said.  

'It's kind of surreal, I can't believe it's all happening. It's like a dream.'

Winner of the gruelling Arch to Arc triathlon, John van Wisse is only 1 of 14 people to take on the race 

The race began on Tuesday with a 140km run from London to Dover where the competitors were set to swim across the English Channel to France.

It was only one day earlier that Mr Van Wisse was mistaken by Dover residents as an illegal immigrant trying to swim to shore while he was taking part in swimming training for the event.

After the gruelling swim across the channel, the race required Mr van Wisse and his fellow racers to ride bikes from Calais in the north of France.

From, running, to cycling to swimming, this race is no ordinary triathlon. Mr van Wisse completed it in 61 hours

From Calais he rode 291-kilometres south to the Arc de Triomphe in the busy city of Paris.

Being just one of 14 people to take part in this international ultra-triathlon, it doesn't come as a surprise that the athlete loves to push himself to the limit.

'I just like big challenges and I couldn't think of anything harder than this,' he said.

'If someone breaks my record then I might come back and have another crack, so hopefully no one does.'

Mr van Wisse has taken to Twitter to thank his sponsors and supporters.

He has also said he will be spending some time recuperating in France with his team.
