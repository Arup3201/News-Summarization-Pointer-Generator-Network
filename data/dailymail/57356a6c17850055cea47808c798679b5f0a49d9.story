It might look like a winter wonderland but this image is actually a microscopic close-up - inside a human intestine.

Every year the University of Bristol challenges researchers to create 'labstract art' to make their work more accessible to the public.

And one of the winning creations was this impression of the intestinal wall which has an uncanny resemblance for a number of Christmas trees.

The amazing image was captured by Alexander Greenhough and Paloma Ordonez Moran from the University of Bristol who are researching the development of colorectal cancer.

The image was created by Dr Alex Greenhough and Paloma Ordonez Moran from the School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine.

Dr Greenhough said: 'The image is of cells that make up intestinal tissue.

'The organised crypt-villus structures in the image reminded me of Christmas trees.

'When I heard about the competition I remembered the image we had captured during our research so I quickly decorated the trees with snow and baubles using Photoshop software as a bit of fun.'He named it 'Wnter wonderland' after the 'Wnt pathway' proteins he is studying.

Dr Alexander Greenhough, who created the image using a confocal microscope and green dye.

The image, generated using a confocal
microscope to study intestinal tissue, was one of 12 winning entries 
into the Art of Science Competition.

Dr Greenhough works in the Cancer Research UK colorectal tumour biology laboratory at the university.

He added: 'It shows that although we scientists are very serious about our research and committed to understanding cancer, we also have a sense of humour - and are normal humans beings.'

There were more than entries in the competition with the 12 winning shots ranging from abstract-like images of fluorescent tissue cells to a heart-shaped cervical lymph node and an invasion of cancer cells.

Nicole Antonio, a researcher from the University's School of Biochemistry and co-ordinator of the competition, said: 'The high quality found in the images received this year highlights how scientists are not the stereotypical eccentrics in white coats, but in fact highly creative and artistic.

'The aesthetic beauty that the researchers have found within their work, taken whilst studying medical problems that affect us all, such as cancer and arthritis, is something that we hope everyone can relate to.'
