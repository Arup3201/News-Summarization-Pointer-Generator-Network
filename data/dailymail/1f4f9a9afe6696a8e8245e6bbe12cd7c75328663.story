A mother has spoken of her distress at being told to lose weight for more than a decade before doctors realised her ballooning legs were the result of a genuine medical condition.

Claire Tickle, now 38, first visited her GP at age 16 after noticing her legs had got so big it looked as though there was an elastic band around her ankle.

For the next seven years she went back and forth to the doctor but was told she had big legs because she was overweight.

Claire Tickle, 38, visited the doctor every year after the age of 16, worried her legs seemed to be growing faster than her body. She was repeatedly told she was overweight and to go on a diet

At the age of 32, Ms Tickle was eventually diagnosed with lipoedema, a condition which causes the legs to become enlarged. As the condition is incurable, her legs have now ballooned to 10-stone

Curiously, she noticed that when she went on a diet she could shed fat from her torso but her legs just kept on growing, she told ITV's This Morning.

It was by sheer chance that aged 32, she was diagnosed with lipoedema – a condition which causes the legs, thighs, buttocks and arms to become enlarged.

As the condition in incurable, her legs have now grown to 10 stone, leaving her in constant pain, having and unable to walk normally or play with her six-year-old son, Alfie.

Her only hope is a new type of liposuction treatment being trialled, which she hopes will become available on the NHS soon.

She told presenters Amanda Holden and Phillip Schofield: 'I was 16 when I noticed I had an elastic band effect around the bottom of each leg.

‘I went to my GP who looked at them and said I had water retention and to go away and try some dieting, which I did.

‘I lost loads of weight off my torso but not off my legs. It was getting bigger.’

She went back and forth to the doctor for years, with her legs growing at an alarming rate, but each time she was told to keep on with her diet.

Lipoedema is the abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks.

It causes the legs to become enlarged from the hips to the ankles but the feet are unaffected.

The fat often creates a ring of fatty tissue overlapping the top the feet.

The skin often feels cold and bruises easily.

It can be very painful and can cause pain in the knees.

Lipoedema occurs almost exclusively in women and tends to start during puberty or pregnancy.

The accumulation of fat tends to be worse in people who are obese but also affects people who are a healthy weight and dieting does not help.

The cause of the condition in unknown but there is often a family history in patients.

The only treatment known to work is called tumescent liposuction but this is not currently available on the NHS.

It involves numbing the legs before removing the excess fat.

This treatment has been shown to be highly effective and has good long-term results.

Being told repeatedly that she was fat caused her to become demoralised and lose hope.

‘I gave up in the end,' she said. 'I was told I was fat all the time,’  

She believes it was only by sheer luck that she ever got a diagnosis.

Six years ago, she was referred to a dermatologist about some eczema on the back of her legs.

‘As soon as I got my legs out for him to have a look at the eczema, he recognised straight away what was wrong with my them,' she recalled. 

Ms Tickle was instantly diagnosed with lipoedema, which some studies say affects as many as 11 per cent of women.

Those with the condition have an excess number of fat cells in affected areas, as well as a build-up of fluid in those cells.

The affected areas tend to feel softer and more doughy than normal fat, and may be tender to the touch, feel painful and bruise easily.

It is not clear what causes it, though as it runs run in families, it is thought there is a genetic link.

Doctors also believe there could be a hormonal trigger, as it often manifests itself after puberty or pregnancy.

As Ms Tickle’s legs grew, they became more painful and began to seriously limit her life. 

‘They’re painful every second of the day,’ she said.

Ms Tickle says her condition leaves her in constant pain and with difficulty walking. She says it knocks her confidence as she feels people judge her harshly, believing she is 'just another overweight person'

From the minute I get up, to the minute I go to bed, I’m in pain. I’m even in pain in my sleep.’

‘I’ve got a young boy who’s six years old. I haven’t been able to do things that mums do and get on the floor and play.

‘I can’t run around in a park with him, I can’t get on a bike.’ 

She is judged harshly because she is so overweight, and people don’t realise she has a medical condition, she added.

She said: ‘It knocks your confidence loads, because of your appearance. 

‘The majority of people look at you and think you’re and overweight person. That’s even GPs, because they’re not educated about it.’

Previously, lipoedema was treated using massage and compression stockings, but a type of liposuction which targets fatty tissues in the legs is being trialled.

Ms Tickle is hoping she will be eligible for the treatment, but will need to lose as much of her ‘normal’ fat first, a task which is hard given her condition makes walking difficult. 

The treatment would dramatically change her life, she said. 

‘It would be absolutely amazing not to wake up in pain every day. That’s the worst thing,' she said.

‘Then the second thing is the mobility, being able to walk properly. 

‘Because having lipoedema gives you a funny gait, when you walk. So I’d love to be able to move around.’ 

While she feels guilty at not being able to play with him as other mothers might, Ms Tickle is grateful to her son Alfie for being so patient and understanding about her condition. 

‘My son Alfie is great because he’s grown up with it. He’s so accepting of it,’ she said. 

'He’s so good, he knows I can’t do a lot of things. But he understands it.’
