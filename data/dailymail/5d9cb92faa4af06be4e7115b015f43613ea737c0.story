Prince Charles picturesque rural idyll is under siege after planning was approved for three sprawling housing estates on his doorstep.

Planning permission has been granted for more than 500 new homes in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, with one development due to be built just one mile from his Highgrove House home.

Angry locals who have fought the controversial plans have now written to the environmentalist royal in a last ditch attempt to stop developers from moving in.

Residents in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, have written to Prince Charles in a bid to stop three housing estates being built - one of which is just a mile from Highgrove, pictured

Campaign group Stop Tetbury's Excessive Planning Schemes said Prince Charles is very involved in the town and they feel that the royal is their 'neighbour'

Developers had fought and lost a bid for 
planning permission for homes on a plot of land just one mile from his 
estate for the last 25 years.

Local councillors repeatedly rejected 
plans for the site and another greenfield in Tetbury but this decision
has now been overturned by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

Horrified locals who have been fighting 
the greenfield plans - on an Area of Outstanding National Beauty - have 
called the decision 'a devastating blow'.

A third plot, on an old brownfield site, had already been approved by councillors and is supported by locals.

This means builders will start 
erecting 436 homes and 50 care apartments within weeks - boosting the 
size of Tetbury, which currently has 2,500 homes, by 20 per cent.

A spokeswoman from Stop Tetbury's 
Excessive Planning Schemes (Steps) said: 'We feel that Prince Charles is
our neighbour. He is very involved in the town and has a shop here.

'He is going to be able to see these 
houses on the site. Part of the site crowns a little and rises in the 
centre so you will be able to see it for miles.

'We are a small market town of 2,500 houses, to give us 463 houses and apartments and a care home is a huge thing to do.

Mayor of Tetbury Rob McCorkell said he is 'bitterly disappointed' at Eric Pickles's decision to grant planning permission for the housing estates on the doorstep of Prince Charles's Highgrove home

'Our infrastructure is extremely 
stretched already. We are not NIMBYs, we feel there is already a large 
development on the brownfield site.

'It is out of scale with the size of the town. If someone doesn't do something they will build here.'

The brownfield site, on a former factory to the north of the town, will see 174 homes along with a 60-bed care home and 50 care apartments built.

A further 250 homes will be built at Highfield Farm, an open greenfield site, with 39 erected on a second field on Bath Road - less than a mile from Highgrove.

In a letter to Prince Charles, sent 
after Steps was informed of Mr Pickles' decision on February 14, the 
residents said 'no one is listening to us'.

They wrote: 'During the Inquiry into 
the Highfield Farm application no notice was taken of our 
representation, in the form of a residents signed letter, that these 
particular fields have been used by locals for over 20 years for 
recreation and dog walking.'

Locals say the new housing estates will be visible from Prince Charles's 900 acres Highgrove House

Hannick Homes first applied to build on the Bath Road site in 1988 and repeated the request numerous times before submitting an application for 39 homes last March.

This was refused by Cotswold District Council but Communities Secretary Eric Pickles overturned the decision this month.

Radical changes to the planning system mean developers can apply for permission to build on greenfield sites.

This applies when the local council cannot prove it has land supply for the next five years.

Campaigners fear Mr Pickles overturning Cotswold District Council's rejection of plans on the greenfield sites will set a 'dangerous precedent' for other areas.

The Steps spokeswoman added: 'If councils aren't said to have enough land supply then anybody can apply to build on greenfield land.

'This is regardless of whether there are brownfield sites available.

Hundreds of new homes will be built at Highfield Farm in Tetbury - set two and a half miles from Highgrove

'The council can reject the developers application but then it can be appealed and accepted by central government. It has left everything open.'

Tetbury Mayor Rob McCorkell said: 'I am bitterly disappointed by this decision.

'I feel that in this case an inappropriate application of the appeal process and the provisions of the Localism Act has led to our community having inappropriate and unwanted development forced upon us.

'It is too early to say what is going to happen in the immediate future but I intend to push for close engagement with the district council and developers in order to minimise the community impact and maximise the community benefit.'

Campaigners have six weeks to appeal Mr Pickles' decision at the High Court.

A meeting will take place between Tetbury Town Council and Cotswold District Council later this week to decide whether an appeal will be lodged.

A spokeswoman for Clarence House declined to comment on the situation.
