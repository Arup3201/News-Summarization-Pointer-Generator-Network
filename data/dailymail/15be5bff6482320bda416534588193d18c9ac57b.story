He was the 14-year-old boy who beat his mother to death in a hammer attack so violent, it left her skull smashed to pieces.

Now the former partner of victim Jacqueline Bartlam, 47, mother of 'Coronation Street killer' Daniel, has told of some of the bizarre behaviour he displayed in the run-up to the violent murder on Easter Sunday, two years ago.

Speaking in new documentary, Kids Who Kill, Simon Matters, 48, from Nottingham, revealed that the troubled boy concealed bags of his mother's underwear in his bedroom and would write gruesome stories before showing them to his family.

Troubling: Simon Matters, 48, the former partner of Jacqueline Bartlam has told of life with killer teen Daniel

'It would be about 7pm on a weekday night
 and he'd come down and show me a story he'd written,' remembers Mr Matters.

'And it would be 
quite gory; it would include someone getting killed and fighting, and 
this kid had hurt someone at school and that kid would go back and kill 
him...

'I would read it and give it back to him and then he would go and show his
 mother and she was the same as me. She'd give it back to him 
and be like "Daniel, what are you writing that for?"'

Daniel had also, as police would 
later find, had written a soap which included a elaborate plot featuring
 a character called Daniel Bartlam who killed his mother.

'The only place he couldn't get away with his bad deeds was with his mother Jacqui,' the script read.

'So one night, he staged a break-in and murdered her with a hammer and then set her and the family home alight.'

Tragic: Daniel was just 14 when he beat his mother Jacqueline, 48, to death with a claw hammer

Warning signs: Mr Matters says Daniel displayed odd behaviour in the weeks before the killing

'Daniel Bartlam was the character that 
done this but it was a soap plot,' remembers Mr Matters. 'As the character in the soap, he'd got
 away with it, got away with it in court and then gone on to become a 
famous soap star. Longest soap star in history, I think he'd finished it 
off with.'

Tragically for Jacqueline and her family, Daniel, who was jailed for life with a minimum 16 year term last year, wasn't just writing his fantasies down - he was planning to carry them out.

Late at night one Easter Sunday, Daniel crept into his mother's room and attacked her with a lump hammer, hitting her seven times on the head and jaw.

To conceal his crime, he wrapped her body in newspaper before dousing it in petrol and setting it on fire. His mother's body was so badly burned, it could only be identified using dental records.

Later, Bartlam told police that a burglar had killed his mother but just two days after the killing, he was charged with his mother's murder.

But a penchant for writing his gruesome fantasies down wasn't the only indication that Daniel wasn't quite the normal boy that he seemed.

According to Mr Matters, he would also smash up Star Wars figurines and developed a habit of urinating and defecating inside his bedroom.

'He had many expensive figurines of Star 
Wars characters and Dr Who characters,' remembered Mr Matters.

'They would be all ruined. He'd 
have plastic boxes full of figures but he'd just urinate in the boxes. 
He also defecated all over the bedroom and in the boxes and hid towels 
and stuff that he'd wiped himself with.

Ablaze: After killing his mother, Daniel set fire to the modest family home in a bid to conceal her body

'One of the things I found that 
disturbed me, but actually Jacqui laughed about it, was a bag of her 
underwear. Obviously, I mentioned it to Jacqui and she was like "Oh my God" but she just brushed over it and said he was just having a prank, 
just messing around.

'It 
was brushed over at the time but later on it became a bit more 
sinister.'

Criminal psychologist Dr David Canter comments: 'In this private room that Daniel created
 for himself, as well as destroying the Star Wars figures and 
defecating, as a 14-year-old boy, he was probably masturbating a lot and
 taking things that would feed his masturbatory fantasies.

'The underwear
 from his mother that he stole could well have been part of that whole 
process and part of his internal fantasy life that became more than a 
fantasy in terms of what he planned to do.'

Dreadful: The remains of Jacqueline Bartlam's bedroom following the blaze caused by her son

Murder weapon: The lump hammer recovered from the Bartlam family home and used by killer Daniel

Despite his bizarre behaviour at home, outwardly, Daniel appeared to be nothing more than a normal boy.

'He was just the boy next door,' says Mr Matters. 'If you saw him in the street, you wouldn't look at him twice. Normal guy.'

He adds: 'It makes it more scary than anything else 
really. The fact he'd been speaking to 
people, going to school and all along, he was planning, he knew he was going to murder his mum.'
