Sunderland have been dealt a triple injury blow with news that Ricky Alvarez, Emanuele Giaccherini and Sebastian Coates will be sidelined for at least the next month.

Former Juventus winger Giaccherini – a £6.5million signing in 2013 – has not featured since September because of an ankle problem, while Liverpool loanee Coates suffered a thigh injury on his debut against Stoke last month.

Inter Milan playmaker Alvarez, meanwhile, picked up a knee injury in training last week.

And manager Gus Poyet said: ‘We have got a couple of little problems with Ricky Alvarez and Emanuele Giaccherini especially, plus a little bit with Sebastian Coates.

‘We think they are going to be out for around a month or so, so it is going to be around that limit, maybe one of them a little bit longer.

‘This is just football; I always use examples like a bull fighter being in the ring and being caught by the bull.

‘It is part of that and this is football and the bad side of football is the injuries, so we need to be a good group and a good squad to cope with certain special players getting injured.’

He added: ‘It is not nice because Ricky was getting better and better and Giaccherini was a very, very important piece of our squad for this year, but the squad need to stand up and players need to come into the team and do well to make sure that when they are back it is going to be difficult for them.’
