Warning: Paul Kenny General Secretary of the GMB pledged a huge campaign of civil disobedience

Union leaders yesterday threatened the ‘biggest  campaign’ of civil disobedience in Britain’s history if  the Coalition tries to curb workers’ rights.

They plan to disrupt public events, block motorways and are prepared to ‘go to prison’ in protest at proposed changes to their pensions.

On the opening day of the Trades Union Congress in London, anger over Government plans to ask union members to pay more towards public sector retirement deals sparked a series of increasingly militant threats.

Left-wing firebrand Bob  Crow, general secretary of the RMT, has argued that mass strikes and civil unrest were now ‘inevitable’.

‘If workers come under attack then it runs in the veins of the trade union movements history to mobilise civil disobedience and resistance,’ he said.

‘From blocking motorways to disrupting Bono at Glastonbury, those are the kind of tactics we need to add to our campaigns.’

Paul Kenny, of the GMB union added: ‘Bad laws have to be broken. Civil disobedience in protest at erosion of civil liberties and freedoms have a place in  our history.

‘If going to prison is the price to pay for standing up to bad laws, then so be it. We will give politicians the biggest campaign of civil disobedience their tiny minds have ever seen.’

TUC Secretary Brendan Barber: The riots which swept through English cities last month revealed 'deep fractures' in Britain's society, he said

TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber yesterday announced a new £2million fund to combat Government spending cuts, raised by charging a 10p levy on its six million members.

Speaking at the TUC congress, Mr Barber launched a wide-ranging attack on the Government’s spending cuts and ‘outrageous’ plans to reform public service pensions.

He condemned the Government’s reaction to last month’s riots and described the Coalition’s deficit-cutting agenda as ‘cruel and mistaken’.

Mr Barber added that there was a ‘strong risk’ of further strike action unless there was a breakthrough in talks over proposed increases to public sector workers’ pension contributions.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said unions should not 'meekly accept' employment laws

The strong-worded comments  from the union leaders will increase pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband to condemn the strike threats when he addresses the TUC today.

Mr Miliband will defend Labour’s historic link with the unions, but he will call on the them to focus on ‘getting on, not getting even’.

He will say: ‘The challenge for unions is this: to recognise that Britain needs to raise its game if we are to meet the challenges of the future and to get private sector employers in the new economy to recognize that you are relevant to that future.’

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘Union leaders now seem to be encouraging mass law breaking as part of their campaign of “civil disobedience”.

Ed Miliband must condemn any incitement to criminality from his union backers.’
