A football mad father has drawn the line at his wife interrupting his TV viewing of the World Cup by using his own version of the new vanishing spray given to referees.

Officials have been using the disappearing marker to draw white lines on pitches in Brazil to stop players encroaching on free kicks.

Father-of-two Mike Taylor, 39, was so worried about his wife and daughters interrupting his viewing he has decided to copy the tactic in his living room.

Mike Taylor has come up with a novel way of keeping his wife out of the room when he is watching football

Whenever 
wife Lisa, 38, Paige, 18, or Lauryn, 15, approach the sofa he sprays a 
line of shaving room in the doorway from the kitchen to keep them out.Â 

However,
 Lisa and the girls got their own back when they posted a video of 
Mike's special spray on Facebook and several women accused him of being 
sexist.

Everton fan Mike, an engineer from Plymouth, Devon, laughed off the controversy but says his spray is here to stay.

He said: 'There was lots of hype around this new vanishing spray and so I decided to try it out for myself with shaving foam.

'I
 sprayed a line in the kitchen to stop my wife passing it - she found it
 hilarious. She was in on the joke and if you look at the video you can 
see her laughing.

'I
 plan on using it for future matches outside my living room so people 
know not to disturb me and I'm able to watch the footie in peace and 
quiet.

'Anyone who crosses it will get a red card.'

The
 genuine article is named 9:15 Fairplay, a reference to the minimum 
distance in metres that opposing players should be from the ball after a
 foul.

Invented by an Argentinian journalist, it's a mixture of butane, isobutane and propane gas, a foaming agent and water.

The
 invention has never been used at a World Cup before but it's nothing 
new for fans of South American football where it's featured in league 
matches for years to stop defensive walls creeping forward.

The
 vanishing spray will not be introduced into the Premier League next 
season despite it being considered a success at the World Cup.

The
 new initiative marks out where a free-kick should be taken from and 
where the defensive wall must stand, aiming to prevent players cheating.

Referee Yuichi Nishimura sprays a temporary line on the field marking ten yards as players from Brazil and Croatia form a wall during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Group A match between Brazil and Croatia

It will be used in the Champions League from next season.

But the Premier League and Football Association will monitor how effective that is before introducing it.

The spray, which has been used in recent seasons in the Brazilian and Argentine leagues, evaporates about a minute after being administered from a canister by the match official.
