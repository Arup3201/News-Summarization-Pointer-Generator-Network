Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim has issued a hands-off warning to other clubs over Radamel Falcao, as speculation continues over the striker's future.

Real Madrid are interested in swooping for the Colombia international, having already signed compatriot James Rodriguez for £60million from the French club.

Falcao returned to action for Monaco on Saturday as he helped his side claim a 2-2 draw with Valencia in the Emirates Cup at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.

He's staying put: Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim maintains that Falcao is staying with the French side

It was the first time he had played since a knee injury in January, which ruled him out of the remainder of the campaign and the subsequent World Cup.

But as Falcao and Monaco prepare to face Arsenal in the same tournament on Sunday, Jardim maintains he will be holding on to the 28-year-old.

'At this point Falcao is our player and he's with us 100 per cent and we don't want to let him go,' Jardim said.

Off so soon? Falcao has spent just one season at Monaco and had been out injured since January

'It's a pity we lost James [Rodriguez] but we can count on Falcao staying. Regardless of what people say, he's our player.

'He's in the final stages of his recovery and he'll be with us this season.'

Rodriguez has already claimed he would be delighted to be reunited with his international team-mate following their season together at Monaco and a previous spell at Porto.
