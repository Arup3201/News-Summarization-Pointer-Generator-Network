Star Wars fans who once flocked to the Tunisian town which was Luke Skywalker's home are now staying away because of the proximity of violent jihadists.  

The desert cliffs around the town of Tataouine were once the backdrop for much of the 1977 classic, parts of which were filmed in the Arab state the year before.

The struggling town on the fringes of the Sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict, as a way-station for jihadists crossing the Libyan border 60 miles to the east, according to CNN.  

The igloo home of Luke and his foster family was destroyed in the film by stormtroopers from the Galactic Empire, but should militants extend their reach across the border, it could well be threatened for real.

Three young men were arrested in the area earlier this month as they allegedly made plans to cross into Libya and join an affiliate of Islamic State, whose tentacles now stretch half-way across the country. 

Two arms caches, one of which included rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, have also been found in the region this month. 

They are thought to have been removed from a Libyan armory in the aftermath of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi's ouster in 2011.  

This area is vast and sparsely populated, with dozens of smugglers' tracks along which petrol, drugs and other contraband are smuggled across the frontier. 

There is now a 1.8-mile no-go zone inside the 380 mile long border, and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles.

The Tunisian government claims the security presence has been boosted seven to tenfold.

A much wider 12 mile buffer zone has also been created, which people can only enter with permission, and men aged 18-35 have reportedly been banned from going to Libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there.

Even so the two gunmen who stormed into the Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis last week, who were both in their twenties, had been able to cross illicitly into Libya in December, according to Tunisian State Security Minister Rafik Chelly.

Chelly told a Tunisian network the pair had received weapons training in the ISIS stronghold of Derna. 

Japanese, Spanish, Italian and Colombian tourists were among
the 20 victims when the gunmen opened fire on their buses
as they arrived at the museum, which houses some of
the Roman artifacts that are one of Tunisia's major draws.

Tourism minister Salma Loumi said the impact from the attack
appeared limited so far, with a few cancellations but words of
encouragement from travel agency and tour company partners for
the north African country's mostly package-holiday bookings.

Six million tourists, mostly Europeans, hit Tunisia's yellow
sand beaches, desert treks and medina souks last year, providing
seven percent of its gross domestic product, most of its foreign
currency revenues and more jobs than anything but farming.

The attackers clearly aimed to cut this lifeline.

'They wanted to hit us through our economic backbone,' Loumi
told Reuters. 'But they won't succeed.'

Her ministry's figures show visitor numbers have yet to
catch up with the years before the Arab Spring uprising that
toppled Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali and ushered in an uncertain
period of political transition.

Now that democracy and political compromise have emerged,
the country hopes to revive economic growth and is counting on
attractions like its Carthage Roman ruins and the great mosque
of Kairouan, part of a UNESCO heritage site.  

President Beji Caid Essebsi has ordered the army to protect
major cities and more than 20 people have been arrested since
the Tunis attack.

Security forces at the scene shot dead two gunmen but another is still on the loose and some of more than
3,000 Tunisians to join Islamist militant groups in Iraq and
Syria have returned home, raising fears of more attacks.

After Wednesday's Bardo assault, several tour companies
suspended some services to Tunis, notably the cruise ship owners
who, shaken by the deaths of some of their passengers in the
attacks, said they would bypass the city for the time being.

An initial study by the finance ministry estimated that
losses for the industry may reach $700 million, compared with
annual revenues from tourism in 2014 of close to $2 billion. 

Militants have targeted the tourism industry before. An al
Qaeda suicide bomber killed 21 people in 2002 in the southern
island of Djerba. In 2013, another bomber blew himself up on the
beach in Sousse. No one else was killed.
