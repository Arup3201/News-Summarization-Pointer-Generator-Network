Gordon Strachan believes there's no chance his Scotland players will melt in the white-hot heat of the Westfalenstadion against the might of Germany.

The national manager has named a 26-man squad to face the recently-crowned world champions on Sunday week at the 80,000 capacity home of Borussia Dortmund.

Strachan called up uncapped midfielder duo Callum McGregor and Kevin McDonald to offset the absence of injured trio Scott Brown, James Forrest and Robert Snodgrass.

Young gun: Celtic's Callum McGregor has represented Scotland youth sides and is now in the senior squad

He's back: Goalkeeper Craig Gordon has been recalled, and will be pushing for the No 1 jersey

Celtic's Craig Gordon returns to the international fold to put pressure on Allan McGregor and David Marshall for the No 1 jersey while Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam misses out.

But irrespective of what side he selects to face Joachim Low's team, Strachan believes his players have the wherewithal to withstand the demands of what is currently the most daunting fixture in international football.

'You find out your true character when you walk out on to the pitch but I don't have a problem with these guys' characters,' he said.

The big match: Strachan has no fear going into the Germany vs Scotland clash at the Westfalenstadion

Golden goal: Mario Gotze volleys home against Argentina to win the World Cup for Germany 

'I have no worries about them at all, not one bit.

'I have no concerns about anyone's going to freeze or think it's too much for them.

'They're looking forward to it, the noise they'll hear in the background in that stadium.

'But they're not just excited about the occasion, they want to get a result.

'We'll go through all emotions as a player for this one – they'll get nervous, they'll get excited.

'But once you get on the field that determines how you are.

'Do we have what happened to Brazil (a 7-1 defeat in the World Cup semi) in our minds? No, not at all, because you can't afford to think like that.'

Celtic midfielder McGregor has gone from a loan player at Notts County to potentially a full Scotland international in the space of a year.

And Strachan believes his selection is due reward for the player's decision to prove himself in the game when it would have been easier to stagnate at Lennoxtown.

'I like to have people who can eliminate people and go by them, and he has shown that,' he added.

'Not just this season, he has shown that last season at under-21 level and Notts County, which was great because he has done something about his career.

'He has got off his backside at Notts County. It's easy just to sit here. So I like that attitude.

'He has come back and now he is playing with Celtic and scoring goals, and going by people.'

Strachan also heaped praise on Hull City's Andy Robertson who seems set to win his third cap and make the Scotland left-back slot his own just two years after plying his trade at Queen's Park.

Robertson had to rehabilitate himself with the Spiders after his release by Celtic – and mixed playing football with selling programmes at Hampden.

'He's playing well,' Strachan said of the former Dundee United man. 'The boys loved him at QPR last week and I was speaking to someone who was playing at Hull yesterday and said he was terrific.

'He's another one who was selling programmes after being told he wasn't needed at Celtic.

'He dealt with that body blow and got on with it.'
