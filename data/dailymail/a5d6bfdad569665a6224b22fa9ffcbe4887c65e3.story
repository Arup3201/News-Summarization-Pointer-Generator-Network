Australians have proven that they are no strangers to lies and infidelity with one in four admitting to being unfaithful while in a relationship.

Among those who have cheated - with kissing and an emotional connection included as a form of deceit - almost two in five have had sex with someone else while in a relationship.

The intimate statistics from a recent national survey of 1,025 Aussies coincides with the home entertainment release of the 2014 smash hit movie, Gone Girl, which is based on a web of secrets, lies and adultery.

About half of Aussies lie about their past and what they are doing to their partners

Victorians came out on top as the most likely to lie to their partner but are also the first to admit to being unfaithful - hence it's no surprise that are the most forgiving if their partner have had a flirty or ‘emotionally intimate’ relationship with someone.

People from NSW are the least likely to give their partners access to their emails, credit cards and bank accounts while Queenslanders have lied the most about where they have been. 

Meanwhile most admitted to not putting all of their card on the table in relationships with three-quarters of couples habitually keeping secrets and nearly two thirds say that their partner doesn’t know their deepest secret. 

Relationship psychologist Melissa Keogh said although honesty was always helpful in relationships - it depends on the level of the secret.

'It's also about why you are keeping the secret - if you are going shopping to buy them a present - well that's one thing but it's all about why you are keeping the secret,' she said.

The majority of Aussies lie to their partners once or twice a week, a survey revelas

Dr Keogh said deliberately keeping secrets from partners was a common issue.

'Secrecy is definitely a problem across the board which is worrying,' she said.  

'It's good to share in a relationship because it allows the opportunity for intimacy which is fundamental to a good partnership.'

But she said it was not essential that people divulge every single detail of their sexual past - as three in five people who participated in the survey admitting they have been dishonest about their sexual history.

'I don't know that we need to be so open with our current partners about out past sexual experiences or how many people either,'she said.

'I don't know if that level of honesty is always helpful in a relationship.'

Dr Keogh was not surprised by the statistic that one in four people admitted to cheating on their partner - whether it be sexual, kissing or emotional.

'It's worrying but that's kind of the reality of life - people often admit to kissing or flirting with someone else - or in an intimate or emotional sense - it happens,' she said. 

People also have different perceptions as to what constitutes being unfaithful. 

'Some people don't see kissing as a really big deal and others are devastated by doing that.  

'But it also reflects reality that people coming to me and saying they had sex with someone is a minority.'

'All of the things that happen in reality - happen in Gone Girl but the movie is more extreme,' Dr Keogh said.

Gone Girl is out now through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and DVD.
