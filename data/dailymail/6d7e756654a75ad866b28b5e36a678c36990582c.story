A ten-year-old Norwegian boy who drove his parents’ car into a snowy ditch offered an inventive excuse to police: he was a dwarf who had forgotten his driver’s license.

The boy – who lives near Dokka, a town 110kms (68 miles)  north of Oslo – put his 18-month old sister into the car sometime before 6am, while his parents were still sleeping and set off to visit his grandparents in Valdres, about 60 kilometres away.

He drove more than 10 kilometres before veering off the road, where he was found by a snowplow driver who alerted police.

Good excuse: A boy drove off a snowy road in Norway, after he stole his parents car. When police found him he told them he was a dwarf who forgot his driver's licence

‘The parents woke up and discovered that the children were missing and that someone had taken off with their car. They were pretty upset, as you can imagine,’ said Baard Christiansen, a spokesman for the Vest Oppland police district.

‘The boy told the snowplow driver that he was a dwarf and that he had forgotten his driver's licence at home.’

Police said the children were not injured and the car was not damaged, and that no charges would be filed.

‘We have talked to them, and I'm pretty sure they're going to pay very close attention both to their children and to their car keys in the future,’ Christiansen said.

Returned safely: The town of Dokka, north of Oslo, where the 10-year-old boy is from
