Houses in London's top 10 most expensive boroughs are worth as much as the entire property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined, research has revealed.

The total value of the UK's housing stock has risen slightly to £5trillion over the past year, but housing wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in London and the South East, according to international real estate adviser Savills.

In their annual Valuing Britain analysis, Savills found the capital's homes are now worth an aggregate £1.12trillion, accounting for 22.5 per cent of the UK's housing value.

This graphic shows how house prices have fallen across the UK since 2007 except in London, where the total property stock has increased in value by 14.2 per cent. Scotland has seen a drop of 3.9 per cent, Wales 14 per cent and Northern Ireland 50.9 per cent - and the housing markets in all three countries are now worth the same as the capital alone

It shows how, while London's house prices have traditionally been higher, the financial crisis has triggered a polarisation of the market as property values fall in every other region of the UK.

Ten years ago the UK's housing stock was worth just £2.9trillion, rising to £5.4trillion at the peak of the market in 2007.

However, the UK total value remains -6.4 per cent below its peak while London's residential real estate has risen 14.2 per cent more than in 2007.

The value gained - £140million - exceeds the total value of all homes across the whole of the North East of England where the total housing stock is worth just £128billion, researchers said.

In the last year alone, it has risen by 6.8 per cent are now worth an aggregate £1.12trillion.

At the other extreme, Northern Ireland's stock is worth £72billion, having fallen -10.2 per cent in the past year.

Savills say it reflects the fact that equity rich markets have outperformed the average and property wealth continues to be more and more polarised between North and South, and between different tenures.

Northern ireland has been the worst affected part of the UK since the crisis with the value of stock falling 50 per cent to £72billion.

The ten London boroughs highlighted in the report are Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea, Wandsworth, Barnet, Camden, Richmond, Ealing, Bromley, Hammersmith & Fulham and Lambeth.

Together, they have an aggregate value equivalent to the total value of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined at just over £550billion.

Even within London, wealth is increasingly focused in core central and high value boroughs.

The richest borough – the City of Westminster – has just 121,600 units, with a total value of £95billion, more than twice the value of Edinburgh and almost three times that of Bristol.

And beyond the capital the analysis highlights some pockets of very concentrated housing wealth.

For example, the high value commuter hotspot of Elmbridge in Surrey, which includes Cobham, Esher and Weybridge, has a housing stock value of £31billion, more than that of Glasgow (£29billion), while that of Windsor and Maidenhead (£23billion) is slightly more than that of Cardiff.

London's dominance is even more pronounced in the private rented sector than in the owner occupied sector.

The capital accounts for some 37 per cent of the UK's total private rented stock value, putting it 36 per cent above the 2007 level.

At the owner occupier level, some £1.7trillion of housing is now in the hands of owners with no mortgage debt. This is an increase of 76 per cent in the past 10 years, and 1.4 per cent in 2012.

By contrast, mortgaged properties have a total value of £1.8trillion, just 42 per cent higher than in 2002 and down -0.6 per cent on last year. This means that mortgaged owner occupied stock accounts for 37 per cent of the total value of UK housing compared to 44 per cent 10 years ago.

Lucian Cook, director of Savills residential research, said: 'These distinctions between North and South, and in particular between London and the South East and the rest, and the concentration of housing wealth in ever fewer hands, will have long term implications.

'It will affect people's ability to get on the housing ladder, trade up or relocate. In turn, it has implications for social and labour mobility and, ultimately, the economy.

'Our analysis also highlights growing value in the private rented sector, not least because demand continues to outpace supply.

'This will create investment opportunities for those with equity, and opportunities for institutional investors to meet the needs of those excluded from home ownership.'
