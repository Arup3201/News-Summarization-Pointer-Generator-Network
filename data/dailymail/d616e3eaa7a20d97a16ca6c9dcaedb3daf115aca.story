He has praised the BBC for being ‘really nice to him’. But Paul Flowers’ ‘cosy’ interview with Newsnight’s Jeremy Paxman looks set to come back to haunt him.

The former Co-op Bank boss’s decision to talk publicly about his dismissal on TV is understood to have breached the terms of his £95,000 pay-off with the Co-operative Group, which is now trying to claw back the cash.

The ex-Methodist minister agreed to the pay-off – divided into three instalments of just over £30,00 each – after stepping down from the ailing bank in last June.

However, following The Mail on Sunday’s revelations about his drug habit – which breached a separate clause requiring Flowers not to bring the firm into disrepute – the supermarket and funeral care group withheld two payments, and asked for the first sum of £31,000 to be handed back.

It is understood that the Newsnight breach will give the group further grounds to recoup its money.

Before being charged with three drugs offences last Wednesday, Flowers told waiting journalists: ‘The BBC has been really nice to me but the rest of you are vultures.’

The reference is understood to relate to the Newsnight interview, which was widely criticised for being too soft.

Jeremy Paxman faced criticism after the programme for the interview being 'soft'. A claim the BBC denies

During the programme, Mr Paxman failed to press Flowers on his drug habit or his taste for rent boys, and allowed him to explain away his behaviour as a response to the death of his mother.

Flowers also claimed the MoS’s revelations were ‘pure and utter fiction’. Despite this, he has not complained to this paper or issued legal action.

During the show, Flowers – who has yet to respond to the Co-op’s requests – claimed the group had not been in touch with him since his departure. A source said this was untrue: ‘We’ve asked him for the money back.’

The BBC insists Mr Paxman ‘conducted a revealing and thorough interview’.
