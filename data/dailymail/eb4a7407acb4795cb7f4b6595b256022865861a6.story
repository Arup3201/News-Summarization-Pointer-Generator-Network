The actor who portrayed the voice of Charlie Brown in Peanuts television shows has appeared in court charged with stalking his former girlfriend and a plastic surgeon who gave her a breast enhancement he apparently didn't like.

Shackled in chains, Peter Robbins pleaded not guilty at the San Diego Superior Court yesterday to two counts of stalking and 10 counts of making criminal threats.

Prosecutors said the 56-year-old repeatedly threatened his former girlfriend, calling her as many as 37 times in a 24-hour period on her cellphone and telling her he would kill her and her son if she did not give back his dog and car.

Prosecutors said he also threatened the plastic surgeon in the coastal city of Carlsbad, calling her office so many times she moved to a hotel temporarily out of fear for her life and hired an armed guard outside her clinic.

Authorities said Robbins paid for the breast enhancement and was demanding his money back after they broke up, according to the criminal complaint.

On December 31, Robbins allegedly confronted his former girlfriend in a hotel room, beating his dog and telling her he would not stop hurting the animal and would kill her if she did not get a refund for the surgery, Deputy District Attorney Elizabeth McClutchey said.

McClutchey said he then grabbed his ex-girlfriend by the neck and shoved her against the door before fleeing.

Prosecutors also told the judge that Robbins had recently purchased a gun and had been practicing at a shooting range.

San Diego Superior Court Judge David M Szumowski agreed to up the bail from $50,000 to $550,000.

Robbins was arrested on Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry after authorities doing a background check upon his return from Mexico spotted a warrant from the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.

Defense Attorney Marc Kohnen told the judge the bail was set too high for a man with no prior criminal record, who has lived in San Diego County for 30 years and whose work is watched by so many children to this day.

He called him a 'distraught man' and said 'this is not a stalking case' but declined to comment on what led to his arrest.

'Mr Robbins is an eccentric individual,' Kohnen told reporters after the arraignment. 'He's not a threat to society.'

If convicted, he would face a maximum sentence of up to nine years in prison, prosecutors said.

Robbins was best known for his 
performance as the voice of Charlie Brown on 'A Charlie Brown Christmas'
and 'It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.'

Speaking in October, he spoke out against the forthcoming Peanuts movie, calling it pointless and a 'horrible idea'.

As a child actor, Robbins became famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark screams of frustration in A Charlie Brown Christmas (above) and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown

He accused 20th Century Fox of 
lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original 
televised version of the popular cartoon.

The new Peanuts film is expected to 
hit the silver screen in November 2015 with a screenplay written by the 
cartoon's creator Charles M Schulz's son and grandson.

Mr Robbins, famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark 'AAUGH!' screams of frustration in the 1960s, said: 'What's the point?

'If it's to reintroduce the character 
of Charlie Brown to a new generation, it's been passed on successfully 
for 46 years. That's the beauty of it.

The 2015 release will coincide with 
the 65th anniversary of the comic strip and the 50th anniversary of A 
Charlie Brown Christmas.

The son of Peanuts creator Charles M. 
Schulz, Craig Schulz, as well as his grandson, Bryan Schulz,Â  worked on 
the screenplay together.

The comic strip ran from October 2, 1950 to February 13, 2000, and in its prime reached 355 million people in 75 countries.
