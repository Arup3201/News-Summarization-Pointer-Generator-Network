Brazen raiders in high-visibility jackets made off with treasured watches worth £210,000 from a collector’s home in Kent.

They tied up and gagged a cleaner, then ripped out a safe that had been bolted to the ground.Homeowner Steve Sulley, 26, said he was sickened by the attack at his home. He has released CCTV pictures in a bid to find the culprits.

He said: ‘The cleaner wasn’t attacked in the sense of cuts and bruises but she was pinned against the wall and had tape around her mouth.

Brazen: Two of the robbers can be seen approaching the door to the house wearing high-vis jackets

‘She was very shaken up and does not even want to answer the door after what has happened.’

The robbers took nine watches valued at £210,000, plus other items of jewellery, cash and credit cards totalling another £40,000.

They burst into the property and pushed the terrified woman to the floor before ransacking the house.

They pulled pictures off the walls, went through drawers and tried to destroy the hard disk of a computer, which they believed was linked to home CCTV cameras.

Captured on CCTV: The pair approach the house before they attempt to gain entry - the empty van can be seen parked in the front of the driveway

Attempt to gain entry: The two men in high-vis jackets can be seen talking to a third person, believed to be the cleaner

Finding the safe was bolted to the ground they tore it out before carrying it away in what is believed to be a large silver van.

Mr Sulley rushed back from Christmas shopping on Regent Street when one of his neighbours phoned him to tell him what had happened.

He said: ‘It was shocking. The neighbour said "your cleaner has been tied up and three guys have gone through your house". I started feeling sick and nearly threw up.’

His cleaner was taken to the police station where she gave a statement about the robbery.

Approach: A third person can be seen approaching the house - the empty van which is thought to have been used to take the stolen goods can be seen in the background

Robbery in broad daylight: Unlike the first two, the third man is not wearing a high-vis jacket as he approaches the front door alone

Uninvited: The third person also attempts to open the door to Mr Sulley's home while the watch collector is out Christmas shopping

It is believed whoever targeted Mr Sulley's house on November 10 might have known about his love of watches.

The company director said: ‘I have a passion for watches and I have a good collection.

‘People know I’m fairly successful at what I do and I have nice watches and a couple of nice cars.’

CCTV images from Mr Sulley’s home have been released in an attempt to try and track down the robbers.
