'Missed opportunity': Private Jason Smith died in 2003 from heatstroke following a period of high temperatures in Iraq

Army chiefs missed an opportunity to step in after a Territorial Army soldier died from heatstroke when temperatures rose to above 50C in Iraq, a coroner has said.

Private Jason Smith, 32, from Hawick in the Scottish Borders was deployed in June 2003.

He collapsed on August 13 that year with a fatally-high body temperature of 41.4C, having repeatedly told medical staff he was feeling unwell. He was taken to hospital but suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be saved.

Pte Smith, who serving with the 52nd Lowland Regiment and was assigned to the First Battalion King’s Own Scottish Borderers, was stationed at the Al Marab athletics stadium on the western side of the city of Al Alamarah.

The inquest at Oxford Coroner’s Court, the second to be held into Pte Smith’s death, heard conditions were tough in the disused stadium, described as a 'an unbearable, hot, dusty hell hole'.

A number of soldiers said they felt unwell because of the conditions, the inquest heard.

Assistant coroner for Oxfordshire Alison Thompson, recording her findings at the end of the five-day hearing, said: 'When climatic conditions deteriorated in August and the number of heat casualties increased, there was a missed opportunity to intervene.'

She added that those in charge of the soldiers could have 'become more rigorous in monitoring individuals' when temperatures soared, making sure they were treated for their symptoms and had enough rest.

In her narrative conclusion, she described the circumstances as: 'Death on active service overseas, involving a high tempo of operations in extreme temperatures, the risk of which would have been reduced by adherence to the then policy on heat illness, in terms of climatic monitoring, hydration, medical treatment and casualty reporting, and by the availability of air-conditioned accommodation and vehicles.'

However, she added that it was not 
possible to prove that those factors 'specifically caused, or there was a
direct causal link, between them and Private Smith’s sad death.'

Temperatures were at their seasonal maximum, and it became hot enough to fry eggs on a Land Rover in the days before Pte Smith collapsed, his commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Cattermull, who was a Major at the time, told the hearing.

Soldiers also faced a 'punishing regime' of working long hours, he added, with the inquest told there was only one medic to take care of 100 men.

Their accommodation was not air conditioned at the time of Pte Smith’s collapse. Air conditioning units arrived there two days after his death.

Mrs Thompson found that advice and information on hydration given to the soldiers serving in such arduous conditions was 'inconsistent' and 'inadequate', but noted it had been stressed to them that drinking enough water was of utmost importance.

She also said that medics had not been given forms to record reports of heat illness, and that not all medical consultations were recorded.

The day before he died, Pte Smith reported to the Army medic with heat exhaustion and was advised to rest. That evening, he was deployed to a power station where he spent six hours in air-conditioned premises.

The coroner said: 'The following day, he deployed twice to a petrol station but, before he was stood down at about 3pm, had spent some time in intense heat inside a Saxon vehicle in full sun.'

She added that the time inside the vehicle was most likely the 'tipping point' that led to Pte Smith’s deterioration.

The
inquest had also been told Pte Smith had been deemed fit for his role 
in Iraq and that the fact he had a relatively high body mass index of 34
would not have played a role in his death.

He had also acclimatised to conditions in Iraq by spending 10 days in Kuwait ahead of deployment, and his body had 'adapted reasonably well', Mrs Thompson said.

Pte Smith was described by Army colleagues as a 'grafter' who never shirked his duties.

Mrs Thompson told his mother: 'It is important to realise what an important job he was doing, in these near-to-impossible conditions.'

She also noted that heat illness is now dealt with in a different way by the Army, adding that it was a 'changed world in terms of soldiering in heat in the last 10 years'.

At the original inquest in 2006, assistant deputy coroner for Oxfordshire Andrew Walker recorded that Pte Smith’s death was caused 'by a serious failure to recognise and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate'.

A second inquest was ordered by the 
Supreme Court in 2010 after Pte Smith’s mother Catherine successfully 
applied for a new public hearing, complying with the European Convention
on Human Rights.

Mrs 
Smith, a grandmother-of-three, said she was glad to have fought for a 
second inquest on the grounds that the Human Rights Act should apply to 
troops serving abroad, but now it was over she could finally grieve the 
loss of her son.

Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Smith said: 'I can live again, basically. I can now grieve, actually, and let it go.

'When it’s been ongoing, you just can’t do that. It’s always on your mind.

'And I’ve heard things that have actually made me even more proud of my son from people, that I didn’t know before.'

Mrs Smith said she was pleased with the conclusion given by the coroner, adding that risks could have been avoided and that there had been 'a lack of following their own protocol'.

Mrs Smith said there had been failures
ahead of her son’s death in terms of the approach to heat-related 
illness, saying: 'In the situation they went into, it’s something they 
didn’t predict, which possibly should have been predicted because of the
time of year they were going in.'

While the struggle to get all the answers has been long, Mrs Smith said it had been worth it.

She said: 'I feel I can now say I’ve done what I can to prevent it happening to other families.

Describing her son, who had been in the Territorial Army for 10 years and had completed a mechanics course shortly before his death, she said: 'Jason wanted to do what he wanted to do. He went out there to help people, which he did.

'I never had anything against him doing what he wanted. It just so happened he was the one that didn’t come back with the group.'

The coroner, who praised Mrs Smith for her 'forbearance', also told her at the end of the hearing: 'It’s been a long journey for you. I know nothing I say will replace the loss of Jason.

'I just hope it’s been of some help in this hearing to hear from his mates, who weren’t there at the first inquest, and to realise, hearing from them, how Jason was so, so valuable to the team.'
