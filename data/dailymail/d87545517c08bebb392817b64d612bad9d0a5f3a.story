A 13-year-old boy stabbed his teacher and injured a girl pupil with a knife because he 'wanted to hurt someone' has been ordered to pay them just £75 each.

The boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, launched the attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at 9am on September 8 last year.

He admitted the attack last week at Worcester Youth Court, but was spared being sent to a Young Offenders Institution with the victims awarded £75 in compensation.

The boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, launched the attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at 9am on September 8 last year 

At a previous hearing, a court was told that the schoolboy had stabbed a male teacher and injured a girl in the classroom because he had 'wanted to hurt someone.'

Following the incident, he fled from the school sparking a huge manhunt, with a force helicopter, sniffer dogs and officers armed with stun guns deployed to find him.

Police arrested the boy shortly before 5pm that day. He was found clutching a bag of Lego after members of the public spotted him getting on a train from Hereford to Malvern.

The court was told that the teacher suffered a minor injury while the girl was slightly injured - which the court accepted 'was an accident'

Officers searched his school bag and found the youth had several 'long bladed knives' in his possession.

Last Wednesday, the teenager pleaded guilty to malicious wounding, actual bodily harm and possession of knives in a public place.

He avoided being sent to a Young Offenders Institution but was given a 12-month referral order with anger management and a a three month curfew between 9pm and 7am.

The court was told that the teacher suffered a minor injury while the girl was slightly injured - which the court accepted 'was an accident'.

The two victims were awarded £75 in compensation each.

The order specified the teen would be given training in 'problem solving, consequential thinking, victim impact and empathy'.

Timothy Gascoigne, defending the boy at a previous hearing, said: 'You must consider he is 13 years old.

At a previous hearing, a court was told that the schoolboy had stabbed a male teacher and injured a girl in the classroom because he had 'wanted to hurt someone'

'He has never done it before and, although I accept completely your concerns, to lock someone up you have to have more than concerns that he will do it again.

'It is quite clear that if dealt with firmly, he does not pose any further problems. Last night, he was very upset.'

The school carried out a review after the incident and said it was satisfied with its security procedures.

At the time headteacher Richard Jacobs said: 'It was a very distressing day for everyone at the school.

'Our thoughts and prayers have been with everyone who was directly involved in the incident and we are relieved that they are able to join us as we return to normal school life.

'Staff were very professional throughout the day and supported students well.

'Students showed their usual high level of maturity and remained calm at all times.'

Today, Detective Inspector Andy Price, of West Mercia Police, said: 'We acknowledge the decision of the youth court and the support that will be put in place for the defendant.

'I'd like to thank the victims, witnesses and staff and pupils at the school for their support in what has been a challenging investigation for everyone concerned.'

Superintendent Mark Travis added: 'I think the school did an excellent job in the way it reacted in a very professional way considering what was a confused and stressful situation.

'They did the best they could to give information but it clearly takes time.

'I think parents and pupils conducted themselves with real control.'
