An amateur football team raised eyebrows when they celebrated winning their local Saturday league by hiring an open-top bus for a 'victory parade'.

London Box Sash FC splashed out hundreds of pounds on their big day, enjoying a five-mile bus ride in front of all 30 of their loyal supporters.

Loaded up with balloons and specially-made banners, the squad knocked back champagne as their red open-top bus left their local Rose and Crown pub in south-west London on Saturday.

The players then completed a circuit of Wimbledon, much to the amusement of the public, most of whom had no idea who the men were.

The team arrived back at the Rose and Crown an hour later, after getting stuck in London traffic.

The men carried on their celebrations at a nearby restaurant where friends and family gathered for the club’s end-of-season awards.

Manager and captain Matt Cook, 26, said they had decided to pay for the bus parade 'for a bit of a laugh' - despite only having a handful of fans.

He said: 'Like our commitment on the pitch, we thought we would go that extra mile with our jubilation and soak up the fervent atmosphere that encapsulates Wimbledon at this time of year.

'Not only did we have the bus parade, we also held the team’s player of the season awards - it doesn’t get much bigger than that for sporting occasions in Wimbledon.

'We just 
did it for a bit of a laugh really, we haven’t even got a big fan base -
 just a man and his dog really. But we also raised a bit of money for 
charity as well by collecting on the way round.'

They even paid for a special banner to adorn the bus and blew up balloons to add to the party atmosphere

London
 Box Sash FC were only formed in August last year but ran away with the Wimbledon 
and District Saturday League Division Three title after winning 13 of their 
16 games.

The team - which is mainly made up of former Leeds University students - scored a total of 61 goals on the way to securing Division Two status.

Goalkeeper Patrick Ellis, 30, said: 'The whole season has not only been a huge success, but a barrel of laughs.

'We're a team of mates united by our love of football. We fully expect to be challenging for the title again next season.'

As well as celebrating their success, the side also managed to raise a total of £250 for the Generations Foundation by collecting donations on their route.

The local charity help children who are disabled, disadvantaged, or struggle with ill health across the London Borough of Merton.
