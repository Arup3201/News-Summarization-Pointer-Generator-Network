Saxon Axe, 20, used suntan lotion and a lit cigarette to set fire to his friend's right leg as a prank

A man has been jailed after setting fire to his friend’s leg using suntan lotion and a lit cigarette.

Saxon Axe, 20, was on a beach in Weymouth, Dorset, with a group of friends when he picked up an aerosol can and sprayed it on his friend.

He then held a lit cigarette to his friend's leg which was covered in the flammable liquid and immediately went up in flames.

Axe tried to put out the fire by carrying the victim towards the sea and dousing the flames with water.

However, the victim had to be taken to hospital where he was treated for serious burns and is now awaiting a skin graft operation to avoid permanent disfigurement.

Axe pleaded guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm and was given a ten-month prison sentence.

Heather Shimmen, prosecuting at Dorchester Crown Court, said that the incident took place on June 19 on Weymouth seafront.

She said: ‘The defendant held a lit cigarette to the victim’s leg and it engulfed his leg in flames.

‘The victim tried to extinguish the flames as did a friend, but to no avail.’

John Dyer, defending, said the offence was an act of foolishness.

He said the victim was a friend of Axe’s for several years and that his client was ‘full of remorse’ for his behaviour.

Mr Dyer said: ‘There is no malice and no motive, it was just an absolute foolish prank that went wrong.

‘It was a completely thoughtless act which has resulted in very serious consequences.’

In jailing Axe, Judge Roger Jarvis said: ‘You were fooling around and then as part of that you sprayed this victim with suntan lotion and set fire to it.

‘It is patently obvious that was a foolish and dangerous thing to do and wickedly thoughtless so far as you are concerned with some very serious consequences for your victim.’
