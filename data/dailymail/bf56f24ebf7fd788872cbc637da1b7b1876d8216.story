The first rule of being a Liverpool player is to show pride and honour. The second is to give it everything you have got.

On both levels this Liverpool team let down their club at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon. This was borderline disgrace.

They have gone, lost their fight, their desire and hunger to win matches after coming within two points of winning the Barclays Premier League title last season.

To recover from this, their sixth league defeat of a season that is disintegrating with every passing week, will take something special.

In the dugout, soaked through to the skin, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is trying to work out where it has all gone wrong.

There is no cohesion and the fabric of the team, established by the hard work and goals of Luis Suarez, has been ripped out of them. They have no response.

It was only a couple of weeks ago when Rodgers admitted he was under pressure to find the answers. So far, this Liverpool team has come up short.

They are no longer playing for each other and the spirit engendered last season, when they ran champions Manchester City so close, has evaporated.

The legs have gone and there are long faces all round.

At the final whistle, after they had surrendered a one-goal lead, they didn't even look bothered to be beaten again. That takes some doing.

There is something seriously wrong at Anfield and over the next few days Rodgers will have to come up with some answers because this boil had to be lanced.

It cannot all be about Suarez, the man who scored 31 times in the Premier League last season, because they spent all the £75million and then some on his replacements.

Two of them - Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert - combined to put Liverpool ahead just 94 seconds into this incredible afternoon at Selhurst Park.

After that Liverpool collapsed and Palace rubbed their faces in the dirt when Mile Jedinak scored with a beaut of a free-kick from 25 yards to make it 3-1.

The Premier League table

The problem for Rodgers is that he has spent the two-week international break, when most of his players have been away, trying to work it all out.

Here they were back to the beginning, perhaps back to the time when Rodgers took over a team that reached the FA Cup and Carling Cup finals under Kenny Dalglish.

The word transition has been used, but this club went too deep into the Premier League title race for that to be bandied around Anfield.

These Liverpool players are letting their supporters down, because you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times the team has chucked it in.

Here they did just that, paralysed by fear and anxiety after Dwight Gayle equalised for Palace in the first half.

After that, Liverpool's collapse here at Selhurst Park wasn't spectacular. It was inevitable.
