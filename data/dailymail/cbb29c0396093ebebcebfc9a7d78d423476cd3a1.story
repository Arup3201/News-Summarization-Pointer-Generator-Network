Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd last night mounted a ferocious attack on David Cameron for breaking ‘the mould of British history’ by downgrading the status of the new Leader of the House of Lords.

Baroness Boothroyd, a respected and much-loved figure on all sides at Westminster, accused the Prime Minister of a ‘careless disregard for the way our constitution works’.

She even suggested that the position of International Development Secretary Justine Greening should be downgraded to allow the new Lords leader Baroness Stowell to enjoy the same rank as all of her predecessors.

Furious: The much-loved Baroness Boothroyd accused the Prime Minister of a ‘careless disregard for the way our constitution works’

The row has been caused by the Prime Minister’s decision not to grant Lady Stowell full Cabinet status after his reshuffle earlier this month.

He decided to downgrade Lady Stowell because of a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts and salaries.

The problem with numbers arose because William Hague, in being demoted to Leader of the Commons, has been given Cabinet status – despite the fact that the post did not attract the full Cabinet rank or salary when held by Andrew Lansley.

As a consequence, Lady Stowell can attend Cabinet but is not allowed to vote, and is being paid the Lords’ minister of state salary of £78,891 a year, compared with the £101,038 that her predecessor, Lord Hill, received.

The unprecedented move has prompted angry protests from senior figures from all three main parties in the House of Lords.

Lady Boothroyd, speaking in an emergency debate in the upper house last night, warned peers they lived in ‘dangerous times’ thanks to Mr Cameron’s decision.

‘The Prime Minister’s demotion of this House in his Cabinet reshuffle challenges its rights, its authority and its long-established role and status in the constitution,’ she said. ‘It breaks the mould of British history. It strikes at the very roots of our bicameral parliament. The place of this House in the Cabinet of every prime minister has never been challenged – until now.

‘I never thought I would witness such careless disregard for the way our constitution works.’

Lady Boothroyd said it was a ‘dead certainty’ that Lady Stowell’s downgraded status would be used as an excuse to ignore the views of the Lords.

And, although international development secretaries have been Cabinet ministers since Labour’s Clare Short in 1997, Lady Boothroyd challenged Mr Cameron over the post’s elevated status.

She said Mr Cameron’s claim that his hands were tied by the restrictions on the numbers of full Cabinet ministers in the Ministerial Salaries Act 1975 was ‘a pretence’.

‘Which section of that Act dictated that he promoted the Minister for Overseas Development [Miss Greening] to the Cabinet and demoted the Leader of the Lords?’ she demanded.

‘Why is the minister for overseas aid made a secretary of state, with full Cabinet rank and pay, while the salary of the leader of this House and her status is downgraded?’

In an attempt to contain the row, Number 10 said Mr Cameron regarded Lady Stowell’s position as ‘a purely temporary one’ which he aimed to rectify ‘at the earliest opportunity’.

The Prime Minister has said he will restore the full Cabinet status of the Leader of the Lords ‘immediately after the election’ if he remains in power.
