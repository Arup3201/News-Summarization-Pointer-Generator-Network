World snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan has claimed his well-documented drug and drink binges actually improved his game

World snooker 
champion Ronnie O'Sullivan has claimed his well-documented drug and 
drink binges actually improved his game and helped his career. 

The
37-year-old - who lost his 1998 Irish Masters crown after testing 
positive for cannabis - is said to have downed up to 15 pints of 
Guinness and smoked cannabis but still managed to play 'brilliantly'.

O
'Sullivan - whose problems with drink, drugs and depression have made 
for a colourful and controversial career - has documented his life in an
autobiography, which is being serialised in the Sun.

He said that while he was having his 'weekly benders' he was having a 
'brilliant year professionally' despite his private life being in bits.

He
admits he 'pushed his luck' by taking drugs during his career, to the 
point where he was desperate for tournaments to be over in order to 
avoid being tested.

He writes: 'I remember getting to every World Championship and thinking, 
''I can't wait til this tournament is over 'cos then there's no more 
drug tests, I can go out and smash it''.

'I'd got caught once in 
my career, but that's all. I'd get tested between events, and I was 
trying to judge it perfectly so there'd be no drugs left in my system, 
but I was pushing my luck.'

O'Sullivan,
who won his fifth world title in May,  has suffered numerous problems 
as he looked for stability on and off the table.

With
both parents jailed for different offences, O'Sullivan's private life 
was rarely not mentioned, and he had spells in the Priory clinic to 
treat his addictions.

Stability
has followed in later life and his win at Sheffield in May made him the
first back-to-back winner of the tournament in 17 years.

But
in his new autobiography, Running,  he has spoken of how different 
things used to be, with sport 'getting in the way' of him having a good 
time. 

He said he would drink anything, and smoke 'spliff after spliff', often until the sun came up.

'The birds would be tweeting and I'd think ''I'm bang in trouble''.'

His new book, O 'Sullivan speaks about his new addiction for running

His new book, O 'Sullivan speaks about his new addiction for running, a passion which has seen him complete a 10k race in 34 minutes -  ranking him in the top 1,500 fastest runners of the distance.

O'Sullivan is currently building up towards the end-of-year UK Championships in York.

He is gradually making a return to the main tour, having taken a year off between his 2012 and 2013 world titles.

He
returned at Sheffield having played one game in 12 months, saying he 
was back in order to earn enough money to pay his children's school 
fees.

There was no comment from World Snooker on Sunday morning.
