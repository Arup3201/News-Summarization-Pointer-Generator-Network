A multi-millionaire alcohol tycoon was found dead by the swimming pool of his mansion after years of excessive drinking, an inquest heard.

John Halewood, 64, who was nicknamed ‘Mr Lambrini’ after launching the cheap sparkling wine and a host of other popular drinks, died of heart failure.

He left behind a £175million fortune accumulated through his  global drinks empire.

The court heard the businessman had 
heart problems that were made worse by his drinking, and he had been 
warned by his doctor just  a year before his death that his alcohol 
intake was ‘damaging  his health’.

But Judy Halewood, his partner of 17 
years, told the court he would drink a bottle of wine a day ‘on average’
and ‘sometimes’ binge drink.

She told how she discovered his body 
at their home in Hatton Heath, Cheshire, after returning from Southport 
in October last year.

Miss Halewood, who changed her surname
to match Mr Halewood’s, told Cheshire Coroner’s Court: ‘I went into the
house … and I looked for John and I couldn’t find him anywhere.

‘I looked all over the house, like the
bedroom, anywhere he might have been. Then I went to the swimming pool 
where he used to swim and use the gym and things, that’s where I found 
him.’

Mr Halewood was found with three times
the drink-drive limit of alcohol in his blood, following a drinking 
session the day before.

Andrew Smallman, managing director at Halewood 
International, based at Huyton, Liverpool, said Mr Halewood had 
contacted him the previous afternoon to tell him he needed to be driven 
home from a restaurant because he had drunk too much at lunch.

Mr 
Smallman settled the ‘substantial’ bill but, instead of going home, the 
pair went to a nearby pub to talk business and then on to see racehorse 
trainer Donald McCain.

Mr Halewood was passionate about horse
racing. He owned Amberleigh House, the winner of the 2004 Grand 
National, which was trained by Mr McCain’s late father, Ginger. After 
the visit, the men went to another pub. They were driven home before 
7pm.

Asked by the coroner if it was usual 
for Mr Halewood to be so drunk, Mr Smallman said: ‘I have seen him like 
that before but not for some time. It is very difficult being a man at 
the top and running a multinational business and when things were 
putting pressure on him, that was his release.’

It is unknown when Mr Halewood died but the lights were switched on in the pool area at 6.39am on the Saturday.

Assistant deputy coroner Dr Geoff 
Roberts said drinking was part of Mr Halewood’s ‘mechanism for coping 
with the strains and stresses’ of running Halewood International.

He concluded that the heart muscle 
disease cardiomyopathy, as well as other known heart defects, were the 
cause of Mr Halewood’s death.

He listed chronic excessive alcohol consumption among the contributing factors. A verdict of natural causes was recorded.

Mr Halewood set up the company, then known as Halewood Vintners, with his mother Eileen in 1978.

It now has a turnover of around 
£270million, employing more than 1,500 people worldwide. The firm also 
owns a 850-acre vineyard in Romania. Its drinks brands include Lambrini,
Crabbie’s ginger beer and Lamb’s Navy Rum.

Lambrini was brought out in the 1980s 
and came to dominate the perry market, with the slogan ‘Lambrini girls 
just wanna have fun’.

Lambrini has achieved cult status since it was first launched by John Halewood in 1994.

The light perry drink, which is still manufactured in Liverpool by Mr Halewood's firm Halewood International Limited, was once famously advertised with the slogan:  'Lambrini girls just wanna have fun.'

The tipple is now available in eight varieties: Original, Light, Cherry, Peach, Cream, Bubbly, Pink Bubbly, Bucks Fizz and Still, ranging from 7.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in strength.

Marketing: One advert for the drink (seen here on You Tube) used the slogan 'Lambrini Girls Just Wanna be Original'

Halewood International, was told to tone
down one advert for Lambrini by the Advertising Standards Authority in 
2005 to avoid linking women's drinking with sexual success.

In September 2007, Lambrini started a television advertising campaign featuring Northern Soul anthem 'The Snake' by singer Al Wilson with the slogan, 'Do The Lambrini.'

In a more recent advert the slogan used by the firm was 'Lambrini Girls Just Wanna Be Original (pictured above).

Mr Halewood set up his company, then known as Halewood Vintners, with his mother Eileen in 1978.

Halewood International now has a multimillion pound turnover and employs more than 1,500 people worldwide.

Other alcoholic drinks made and distributed by the company include Lamb's Navy Rum, Tsingtao Chinese Beer and Red Square vodka.

Mr Halewood's passion outside work was horse racing, and his horse Amberleigh House won the Grand National in 2004.

People attending Mr Halewood's funeral last year were invited to join his family in wearing his racing colours of red, black and white.
