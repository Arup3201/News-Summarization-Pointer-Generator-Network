A 20-year-old mother who had allegedly decapitated her three-month-old baby girl was suffering from post-partum depression and 'speaking of demons', family members said on Tuesday.

Deasia Watkins, from College Hill, Ohio, was charged with aggravated murder after she was found inside a home with her dead baby lying on a counter early on Monday.   

Police said baby Janiyah was killed by 'homicidal violence', but sources told Fox19 that the child's head had been severed.

The coroner reportedly said on Tuesday that the baby suffered multiple stab wounds to the face and a fractured right arm.

Deasia Watkins, 20, allegedly severed her three-month-old baby girl's head on Monday

The young woman's aunt Caretha White told Fox that  Hamilton County family services had failed the child by allowing Deasia, who suffered from depression following the baby's birth in December, to care for her.

Hamilton County Job and Family Services (HCJFS) declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online.

Ms White also said that another relative had been given temporary custody of the child and Miss Watkins was told to keep away.  

A cousin told Cincinnati.com that he had spoken to the child's father, who claimed the new mom had been 'acting crazy... speaking of demons'.

A juvenile court judge ordered HCJFS to take custody of the baby on March 6 after the young mom was hospitalized for psychiatric problems.

On January 25, police reportedly went to her apartment to find the baby crying and the 20-year-old screaming. 

Officers allegedly that Watkins smelled of marijuana and refused to hand over the baby. When they took her daughter she 'passed out with her eyes open', according to Cincinnati.com.

A group of children raised the alarm around 6am on Monday after finding Watkins with the baby's body inside the home, WKRC reported. 

Her relationship to the children is not known.

Police had cordoned off the home with crime scene tape on Monday. 

'She must have been out of her mind. I heard she cut the baby's head off,' neighbor Jimmie Graham said on Monday.

Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities say

The murdered baby was found inside this College Hill, Ohio home around 6am on Monday and Watkins was taken to hospital for mental evaluation. She was charged with aggravated murder on Tuesday

Watkins was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for a mental evaluation. 

According to court records, the 20-year-old was diagnosed with post-partum psychosis.

Hamilton County Juvenile Court records revealed that Janiyah had been placed in the custody of Job & Family Services on March 6 after a complaint filed by the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office last month, WCPO reported. 

That complaint claimed that the baby girl was neglected. 

It was unclear how the mother regained custody of the child, but WKRC reported that she had been placed with a family member.

Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said at a press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs.

Relatives were seen visiting the home where the child's body was found on Monday.

It was not known if Watkins lived at the address. Property records last place her living at an apartment 10 miles away from the murder scene.

WCPO reported that the young mother's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.

The Cincinnati Police Department Homicide Unit and the coroner's office were investigating.
