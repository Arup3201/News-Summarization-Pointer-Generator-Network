The Liberal Democrats today boasted of victory over Conservative 'siren voices' who wanted to lift people out of paying the 40p tax rate.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said he had won the battle to increase the income tax threshold to £10,500 ahead of next year's election, despite Tory MPs demanding action on the higher rate.

Writing for MailOnline, he said increase the threshold is fair but 'many Conservatives don’t like this because it’s a Liberal Democrat idea'.

Increases in the income tax threshold mean basic rate tax payers will be £800 better off in 2015-16 than in 2010

The amount of money workers can earn before paying income tax has risen from £3,005 in 1990-91, and will hit £10,500 in 2015-16, George Osborne announced

Millions of workers are to be handed a pre-election tax cut worth an extra £100, George Osborne revealed today.

The
 amount people can earn before paying income tax is to rise to £10,500 
from April next year, £500 higher than the coalition planned when it was
 formed four years ago.

And 
in a surprise move he will ensure the tax cut is enjoyed by almost all 
workers, including most of those dragged into the 40p tax band.

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the Tories do not like the income tax cut because it is not their idea

Increasing the income tax threshold was a flagship policy of the Lib Dems, who pledged to increase it from £6,475 in 2010 to £10,000 by the general election in 2015.

The policy was adopted by the coalition and became the signature tax cut, despite calls from Tories for a cut in the headline tax rate.

Mr Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said he had forced the rise through in the face of opposition from Tory backbenchers.

Writing for MailOnline, he said: 'Many Conservatives wanted us to do something different. You
 only have to listen to what some Tory back benchers have been saying in
 the run up to the Budget urging action on the 40p rate instead.

'Those
 siren voices in the Conservative Party also miss the point that raising
 the personal allowance helps nearly all taxpayers, including the 
majority in the 40p band.

'While
 raising the personal allowance is fair and popular it seems that many 
Conservatives don’t like this because it’s a Liberal Democrat idea.'

The new increase to £10,500 means basic rate taxpayers - anyone earning less than around £41,000 a year - will be £800 better off in 2015 than in 2010.

At each budget Chancellor George Osborne has announced big increases in the threshold, which means the £10,000 target will be hit a year early in April 2014.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg pushed for another rise in today's Budget of £500, allowing workers to keep an extra £100 of their earnings. He described it as a ‘workers bonus’ to offset the pain of years of austerity. 

George Osborne's changes to the 40p tax rate before the Budget meant that 1.3million more people had been dragged into paying it

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has tried to take credit for a £500 rise in the income tax threshold, which will almost all workers are £100 better off next year

Ahead of today's Budget he sought to 
claim credit for the policy from the Tories.  'Of course it's a Liberal 
Democrat policy,' Mr Clegg said.

'It was on the front page of our manifesto and it's now been transformed into the pay packets of millions of British taxpayers.

'It wasn't in the Conservative manifesto, it was only in the Coalition Agreement because I insisted that it should be.

'Everybody
 knows I've been going on about this for over half a decade, while the 
Conservatives have been going on about inheritance tax cuts for 
millionaires, tax cuts for the very wealthiest, tax changes to give up 
your employment rights for shares.'

The changes mean that for this year the number of basic rate taxpayers is 24.3million, the lowest since 2006-07.

However, Mr Osborne has faced a storm of criticism from some Conservatives for freezing and lowering the higher rate of tax.

In 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate.

But this year the threshold has fallen to £41,450, which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate.  In 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate.

Increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010

Critics say the higher rate is no longer faced only by the ‘highly paid few’ but hitting middle earners like teachers, nurses and small businesses.

The Treasury insists that anyone earning less than £100,000 has benefited at least in part from the increase in the income tax threshold to £10,000, although only basic rate payers have saved  £700-a-year.

A typical higher rate taxpayer will be only £56 better of this year than under inherited plans.

And Mr Osborne has ensured that the full £100 tax cut in 2015 will be passed to most people paying the 40p rate, up to incomes of £100,000.
