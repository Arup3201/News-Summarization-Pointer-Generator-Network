A young person who wants to buy their first home will need to find a deposit of £60,000 by the end of the decade, a shocking report revealed yesterday.

The study highlights the nightmare facing a generation of young people who have little or no chance of buying a home unless they are rich, well-paid or have generous parents.

In London, the situation will be even more acute with the average deposit set to hit more than £110,000 in 2020.

Money: A typical first-time buyer last year put down a deposit of £43,300 on a property which cost £173,200

This is more money than would have been needed to buy a home in the capital in 1998 - but will soon just cover a small deposit on the same property.

The analysis, from the consultancy Oxford Economics, says a typical first-time buyer last year put down a deposit of £43,300 on a property which cost £173,200.

But the financial pressure on young people is going to get even worse over the next seven years, according to the report, which looks only at England.

By 2020, it says a first-time buyer who puts down a 25 per cent deposit will need £61,300 to buy the average young person’s home which will cost £245,165.

Teresa Richardson, assistant director of the National Housing Federation, which commissioned the research, said England is facing ‘a housing crisis of huge proportions.’

She said: ‘A whole generation is at risk of being priced out of home ownership forever.

Options: By 2020, the report says a first-time buyer who puts down a 25 per cent deposit will need £61,300 to buy the average young person's home which will cost £245,165

‘By 2020, the average deposit required for a first home will be more than £60,000 - and in London it will top £100,000.

'Where are young first-time buyers and hard-working families supposed to find the money for the safe, secure home that so many of us aspire to?'

‘Where are young first-time buyers and hard-working families supposed to find the money for the safe, secure home that so many of us aspire to?’

By 2020, it predicts the average salary will be around £30,000, which means the deposit will be the equivalent of two years’ salary before tax, an impossible amount of money to save.

At this level, the cost of their first home will be eight times larger than their salary.

Two-thirds of first-time buyers only managed to get onto the property ladder due to the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

The CML said 66 per cent of first-time buyers in recent years have had ‘parental assistance’.

Problematic system: The Housing Minister, Mark Prisk, said Britain has a 'dysfunctional' housing market because so many young people cannot fulfil their dream of buying a home

This puts huge pressure on parents, many of whom feel obligated to help out their children to get onto the housing ladder, even if they cannot really afford to help.

It comes after the Housing Minister, Mark Prisk, said Britain has a ‘dysfunctional’ housing market because so many young people cannot fulfil their dream of buying a home.

Speaking at a CML conference in November, the Tory MP said it ‘cannot be right’ that large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s cannot afford to buy their own home.

Mr Prisk, a former chartered surveyor, said the coalition Government has inherited ‘a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold.’

He said: ‘We see 1.6million young people - people in their 20s and 30s - still living with Mum and Dad because they can’t afford their own place. That cannot be right.’

When saving for a deposit, it is easy to forget that there are a whole range of other fees that you need to think about.

Money Advice Service has compiled a list of extra costs to help This Is Money readers, which need to be factored in to your overall buying or moving budget before you take out a mortgage. Fees vary by lender, value of property and mortgage size.

Deposit - mortgage providers will need you to save at least 5 per cent of the cost of the home you want to buy. So if you want to buy a home costing £150,000, you’ll need to save £7,500.Mortgage set-up fees - some lenders charge a mortgage booking fee (or equivalent), usually to reserve funds on a fixed or capped rate product. The typical cost is between £99 and £250 and may be refundable if the mortgage application falls through before completion (check this before you pay for it).Mortgage arrangement fee - some mortgage products will incur an upfront fee, which some lenders call an ‘arrangement fee’. This may be in addition to a separate booking fee. It can cost up to £2,000 and is added to your mortgage amount. You will have to pay interest on the amount if you decide to do this.Valuation fee - this is charged by a mortgage lender to value the property you are buying. It costs between £150 and £1,500, depending on value of the property. Some lenders will pay this for you so try and negotiate this into your contract.Mortgage account fee - this is a single fee charged by the lender when you take out your mortgage to cover set up, maintenance and closing down costs of your account. You won't have to pay a separate exit administration fee when you repay your mortgage. It's typically £100 to £300. This is a separate cost from the arrangement fee.Higher lending charge - if you're borrowing most of the value of the property, the lender may charge a fee to take out insurance cover. This protects them in case you can't cover the costs of your repayments and they have to sell your house at a loss. The lender can still chase you for the shortfall.The amount will depend on how much you borrow, and how much you're contributing as a deposit. If you do have to pay one, it’s usually around 1.5 per cent of the amount you’re borrowing. So, for example, on a mortgage of £150,000, this would be £2,250.Searches - you can incur a fee for searches to the local council to check whether there are any planning or local issues that might affect the property’s value. They may also instruct a drains search at the same time. These are usually done by your solicitor. This can cost between £250 to £300.Legal Costs - you will need to pay your solicitor to carry out the legal work. This costs around £500 to £750 plus VAT.Stamp Duty - this is paid on land and property transactions in the UK. This is paid by the buyer and costs between 0 per cent to 7 per cent of the purchase price of the property. (CLICK HERE to use This Is Money's stamp duty calculator)Survey - this is paid by the buyer to a surveyor to check for structural defects on the property.There are three types of survey:Home condition survey – this is the most basic and cheapest survey. It’s best for new-build and conventional homes. Typical cost: £250.Homebuyer’s report – this is a much fuller survey, looking thoroughly inside and outside a property. It also includes a valuation. If you are choosing this option, you should see if you can get the valuation and homebuyer’s report done at the same time to cut costs. Typical cost: £400+Building or structural survey – this is the most comprehensive survey and is done for an older or non-standard property. Costs £600+Registration of title - in Scotland you will need to pay a title registration fee. The cost of this will vary on the value of your property.Moving costs - this cost is paid to the removal firm to move, pack and relocate your possessions. Try the Money Advice Service’s Smart Mover Calculator.Telegraphic transfer fee - paid by the lender to transfer the mortgage money to the seller’s solicitor. Usually between £40-£50.Building insurance fee - some lenders will charge their customers if they choose to take out buildings insurance with a different company. This will cost around £25.
