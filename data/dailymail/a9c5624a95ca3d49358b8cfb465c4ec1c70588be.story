The bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for 'reckless misconduct', a report recommends today.

The new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their 'shocking and widespread malpractice', the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards said.

Not a single British banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash began in 2007, but the proposed legislation would make sure they would be 'on the hook' in future, it added.

As well as prison terms, errant 
bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services 
industry, as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being 
cancelled.

Commission chairman Andrew Tyrie MP 
said: 'Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage 
their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, 
banned from the industry, or, in the worst cases, go to jail. That has 
not been the case up to now.

'This deals with some of the senior people who many feel got off lightly last time and for whose mistakes we are still paying.'

In its 527-page report, the commission
found that 'deep lapses in standards have been commonplace'. 'It is not
just bankers that need to change. The actions of regulators and 
governments have contributed to the decline in standards,' said Tory MP 
Mr Tyrie.

The commission of MPs and peers calls 
for a sweeping overhaul of top pay, with City regulators given new 
powers to cancel pension rights and payoffs for the bosses of bailed-out
banks.

It also wants watchdogs to be able to
force banks to defer bonus payments for up to a decade, in order to 
prevent bosses reaping large rewards for risky, short-term strategies 
that subsequently lead to losses.

'The rewards for fleeting, often 
illusory success have been huge, while the penalties for failure have 
been much smaller, or non-existent,' Mr Tyrie said.

However, John Cridland, director 
general of the CBI, said: 'There are tough criminal sanctions in the UK 
for those who engage in fraudulent behaviour. Enforcing those must come 
before the introduction of new sanctions.'

The findings of the commission, set up
last summer in the wake of the Libor scandal, are not binding, but the 
Government is being urged to implement its recommendations 'in full'.

The proposals will now be handed to ministers. The reforms will aim to 
prevent a repeat of the bailouts and scandals such as Libor 
rate-rigging, where bosses have walked away with large payoffs and 
pensions.

But bankers will not be targeted 
retrospectively. Fred Goodwin, who left RBS in ruins but is still 
receiving a pension of £342,000 a year for life, will be unaffected.

Nor will any legislation ensnare 
former HBOS boss James Crosby, who will collect £406,000 of his 
£580,000-a-year retirement deal. Under current rules, senior bankers 
have been able to evade punishment by claiming they were not personally 
responsible for collapses and that they had not committed deliberate 
fraud, with the onus  on financial authorities to prove wrongdoing.

But in the new proposed regime, top 
managers would be held individually accountable and would have to show 
they took 'all reasonable steps' to avoid a failure.

'A
lack of personal responsibility has been commonplace throughout the 
industry,' Mr Tyrie added. 'Senior figures have continued to shelter 
behind an accountability firewall.'

The
commission also wants a new licensing system to stop traders involved 
in setting Libor rates and prevent area managers who oversee the sale of
financial products from slipping through the net.

They will have to abide by a new set of conduct rules or lose their licence.

The
report also recommends that City watchdogs should be able to force 
badly-behaved banks to sign a formal agreement to improve their culture 
and standards.

The 
commission – whose members include the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin 
Welby and former Chancellor Lord Lawson – also demands the dismantling 
of UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body that is supposed to manage 
taxpayers' holdings in RBS and Lloyds at arms' length from ministers.

It said the Government, which denies 
forcing the resignation of RBS boss Stephen Hester, has interfered in 
the running of the two banks and that UKFI is seen as a 'fig leaf' for 
'the reality of direct government control'.

Ministers must also make an immediate 
commitment to analyse whether RBS should be split up into a 'good bank',
that could lend more to small firms and personal customers, and a 'bad 
bank' to dump its toxic assets, the commission said.

A
study of high street lenders by competition watchdogs and an 
independent panel of experts to look at measures to help bank customers 
were also part of the recommendations.

Lord
Oakeshott, a former LibDem Treasury spokesman, said: 'Why are there no 
banged-up bankers? That is what most people want to know after the last 
five years of scandals and shame and moral and financial bankruptcy.'

He
added: 'We must stop the subterfuge of UKFI and put the Treasury on the
spot to make the banks we own lend.

'RBS, our biggest business bank, has
failed the nation that rescued it at £1,500 for every taxpayer. It must
be broken up with new management and tough net lending targets for the 
good bank so small business can grow again.'
