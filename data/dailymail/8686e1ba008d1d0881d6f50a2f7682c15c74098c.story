The Internal Revenue's Office of Inspector General told Congress on Thursday that it is investigating whether former IRS official Lois Lerner committed crimes when her office targeted conservative nonproit groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status over a three-year period.

Last year IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified that untold thousands of Lerner's emails were lost when her hard drive crashed, and that there were no archives of the messages.

But in a dramatic evening hearing, the House Oversight and Governmnt Reform Committee heard that investigators needed only two weeks to locate 32,774 of them on 744 backup tapes. IRS higher-ups, they said, had never asked them to look.

Another 424 tapes have yet to be scoured. Deputy Inspector General Timothy Camus declared that his office is looking at 'potential criminal activity.'

STRANGER: A top IRS inspector said Thursday night that supposedly unrecoverable emails which might show the arc of a targeting scandal have been found on backup tapes 

FOUND! – Lois Lerner's emails are turning up on backup tapes after the IRS commissioner testified that no such archives existed

'SHOCKING': House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz was dumbfounded that IRS managers had never actually asked investigators to look for Lerner's emails

Inspector General Russell George bore the brunt of committee Democrats' anger for hsi refusal to produce additional records related to the scandal.  

'You're not entitled to certain documents,' Mr. George told lawmakers.

'Oh really?' shot back Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly. 'We'll see about that, won't we?' 

In a 2014 interview that aired during the Super Bowl, President Barack Obama told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly that there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' in the Lois Lerner case.

Republicans slammed him at the time for commenting while an investigation was still ongoing. 

Neither Camus nor George would describe the contents of any of the emails at Thursday's hearing. 

Several Oversight Committee members questioned how hard the IRS tried to produce the emails, given how quickly independent investigators found them.

ORLY? Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, pressed the IRS on whether more documents would be forthcoming

'We have been patient. We have asked, we have issued subpoenas, we have held hearings,' said Itah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the committee.

'It's just shocking me that you start, (and) two weeks later you're able to find the emails.'

The IRS issued a statement saying the agency 'has been and remains committed to cooperating fully with the congressional oversight investigations. The IRS continues to work diligently with Congress as well as support the review by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.'

The agency estimated it has spent $20 million responding to congressional inquiries, generating more than 1 million pages of documents and providing agency officials to testify at 27 congressional hearings.

True the Vote, one of the tea party-linked groups that waited years for its tax-exempt application to be approved, claimed Friday that 'the IRS was apparently given instruction to do whatever necessary to silence those who spoke out against the Obama Administration. It became a West Wing weapon of choice.'

'Americans are beginning to understand that the politics of "hope and change" has an enforcement arm that operates like an organized crime syndicate.'

Lerner retired near the end of 2013, with a full government pension, months after refusing to testify in an Oversight Committee hearing about how her Exempt Organizations Office chose to delay applications for years based on the presence of words like 'tea party' and 'patriots' in some groups' names.

Some Democrats tried to diminish the significance of location thousands of Lerner's emails, pointing out that the IRS doesn't yet know if some or all – of them are already included in more than 70,000 other messages the IRS has already turned over to Congress. 

'So as I understand it from your testimony here today, you are unable to confirm whether there are any, to use your own words, new emails, right?' New York Democratic Rep. Caolyn Maloney asked Camus.

'That is correct,' he replied.

'So what's before us may be material you already have, right?' she shot back

'That is correct,' he said.

Maloney threw up her hands and wondered aloud: 'So may I ask, why are we here?'

The IRS inspector general set off a firestorm in May 2013 with an audit that uncovered what became known as the 'tea party targeting' scandal that unfolded during the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Several hundred groups had their applications delayed for a year or more. Some were asked inappropriate questions about donors and group activities, the audit report said. 

Last year the entire House of Representatives voted, mostly along party lines, to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions.
