Stressed: David Lewin was a high flying City worker with a history of depression

A stressed City high-flyer phoned his wife from the bottom of their garden and said he was going to shoot himself, a coroner heard today.

Managing director, David Lewin killed himself before his wife, Sophie, managed to get out of the house.

The dramatic suicide followed a family party and was carried out after Mr Lewin, who was also a church warden, had driven their son back to boarding school.

An inquest heard that the father-of-three had been under pressure at work and had been busy travelling around Europe making key presentations as part of his job in reinsurance.

The 47-year-old was home for a family party when, after driving his son back to boarding school, took his shotgun into the garden and killed himself.

Following the inquest into Mr Lewin’s death, his wife said that she had gone to bed when he called the house phone from his mobile.

'He rang me from the garden and told me where he was and I realised things were very wrong. Something very wrong was going on,” said Mrs Lewin.

'So I jumped out of bed, I was shouting "no".

'On my way down the stairs I could hear gunshot, I immediately rang 999 and got the police and ambulance.

'I was hoping that it was not what I thought.'

Speaking at the inquest in Newbury, Berkshire., Mrs Lewin said that her husband had suffered from depression and anxiety for several years but had become increasingly stressed in the months before his death, after his own father died.

'It was more severe than I had seen him with it,' she said. 'He had started to lift out of the depression at the time he killed himself.'

Mrs Lewin said that her husband had also been seeing a Harley Street psychiatrist, and was taking medication for his depression.

The family had been celebrating a 
birthday and after the party Mr Lewin drove one of their children, 
James, back to boarding school in Dorset where he was sitting his GCSE 
exams.

Mrs Lewin told 
the inquest that she had been worried about Mr Lewin on the 90 minute 
drive as he was feeling tired after preparing for an important 
presentation he had to make to clients in Paris.

'He said "I want to take James back’". Looking back I see that as saying goodbye to James,' she said.

When
Mr Lewin returned to the family home in Westbrook, Boxford, West 
Berkshire, the couple chatted about the party before Mrs Lewin went to bed 
and the tragedy unfolded.

Tragedy: The Berkshire family home where Mr Lewin shot himself in the garden

Mr Lewin’s body was found in the garden, the shotgun normally kept under lock and key, lying underneath his arm. A suicide note was also discovered inside the house.

A post mortem examination confirmed that Mr Lewin had died from a gunshot wound to the head.

Mrs Lewin said that she had never worried that Mr Lewin would kill himself but had feared he might become ill because of how hard he had been working.

'I was really worried that he would end up having a heart attack or a stroke. It never occurred to me he would have taken his own life,' she said.

'He was very much involved in the local community and in the church. He would have felt that would not have been something that was the right thing to do.'

Paying tribute to Oxford University graduate Mr Lewin, who also worked as a warden at their local parish church, Mrs Lewin said he was a 'devoted husband and father'.

He said: 'He showed an example of public service and concern for other people which he never had for himself.

'People have written in letters that he was "too nice" a person for the City - there are nice people in the City but he did not have a ruthless streak.'

The Berkshire assistant deputy coroner, Anna Burnside, ruled that Mr Lewin had taken his own life while suffering from depression.

She said: 'For the last 10 years or more Mr Lewin suffered anxiety and depression. He was taking medication and seeing a psychiatrist in London.

'His anxiety and depression was particularly bad in the last couple of years, he was under stress at work .

'There was a note found and there was an indication from that he wished to take his own life.'
