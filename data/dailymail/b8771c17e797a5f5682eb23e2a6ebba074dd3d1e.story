Slavisa Jokanovic has been appointed the new Watford manager after a bizarre week at the club. 

The former Chelsea midfielder takes over at Vicarage Road as Billy McKinlay left the Hornets after just eight days in charge.

McKinlay became Watford's third manager this season following Oscar Garcia's decision to stand down and the departure of Giuseppe Sannino.

Sannino resigned on August 31 amid reports of dressing room unrest and was replaced by Garcia, who stepped down on September 29 after being admitted to hospital with chest pains.

But McKinlay has vacated his post after taking charge of just two games. Sportsmail understands he wasn't willing to stand aside - taking up a role as assistant - to allow a foreign coach to come in. 

Jokanovic will be remembered by Chelsea fans after a two-year stint at Stamford Bridge, while the 46-year-old has managed Partizan Belgrade, Levski Sofia and Hercules.  

Explaining the decision to hire the Serbian, Pozzo said in a statement published on the club's official website: 'Our job is always to act in the best long-term interests of this football club. There can be no compromise on this - whatever the circumstances.

'I fully support and endorse the view from our technical staff that, given the talented squad which has been assembled and our position in the league, an experienced head coach with a winning pedigree is of primary importance to help ensure the success we are all striving for.

'The supporters of Watford have always been very understanding towards our project here and I am certain they will continue to do everything they can to support the new coach and his squad.' 

Watford fans will be stunned to hear McKinlay is set to leave after just two games

McKinlay recorded a win over Brentford and a draw at Brighton in his two games in charge

- Played 39 Premier League games for Chelsea between 2000-02

- Has managed Partizan Belgrade, Levski Sofia and Hercules  

Watford beat Brentford 2-1 in his first game in charge last Tuesday and then drew 1-1 at Brighton at the weekend.

But despite sitting third in the Championship, McKinlay's short spell in charge looks set to come to an end. 

On taking the top job at Watford, McKinlay left his role as Northern Ireland assistant manager in order to focus fully on his job at Vicarage Road.

Former Dundee United, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder McKinlay spent nine years coaching at Fulham before leaving following Martin Jol's sacking last season.

Watford owner Giampaolo Pozzo - who also owns Udinese in Italy and Spain's Granada  - now has his fourth manager in just six weeks.
