Since launching last Friday more than 10 million people have picked up the iPhone 6 Plus, Apple’s ‘bigger and better’ version of the iPhone 6.

But for some, bigger isn’t necessarily better and the larger screen can pose a problem when trying to use the device with one hand.

With that in mind, a Japanese company has devised an extension for your thumb that lets you access the entire screen while holding the phone in one hand.

Tokyo-based Thanko Inc has released a thumb extender for smartphones (shown). Called the Yubi Nobiiru - which translates as 'finger growth' - the hollow silicone device helps you reach the entire screen with one hand. This is especially useful for larger phones like the iPhone 6 Plus

Tokyo-based Thanko's thumb-shaped style, called the Yubi Nobiiru - which translates to ‘finger growth’ - retails for £8.51 ($13.63).

Made of silicon, the fake digit weighs 0.024lbs (11g) and is hollow inside so it can be worn on a thumb or finger.

At its tip is a small black conductor, which ensures that modern touchscreens can register it when it makes contact.

Wearing the extender means that, with one hand, most people will be able to access the entirety of a phone screen with one hand.

This will also reduce instances where a palm accidentally brushes the screen and registers an input.

So-called phablets, the mid-point device between phones and tablets, such as the iPhone 6 Plus are becoming increasingly popular in Asia.

In 2013, phablets overtook shipments of laptops and tablets for the first time in Asia.

To make them appeal more to people used to smaller screens, Apple included a ‘reachability’ feature with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

When the home button is double tapped, the screen shifts down to the lower half, making things easier to reach with one hand. 

The iPhone 6 Plus is 7.78cm (3.06 inches) wide, while other large phones include the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is 7.92cm (3.12) inches wide.

Of course, that’s just from side-to-side - diagonally the 6 Plus is 14cm (5.5 inches), and the Note 3 is 14.5cm (5.7 inches).

The average male thumb is 6.96cm (2.74) inches long and for women it’s 6.32cm (2.49 inches).

Clearly this poses a problem, as the average thumb cannot stretch from one side of a phone to the other without part of the palm touching the screen, which can accidentally register an input.

Using the Yubi Nobiiru thumb extender, though, 0.6inches (1.5 cm) is added to the length of the thumb.

This means people can more easily reach from side of the phone to the other - as long as they don’t mind wearing the extender. 

The fake thumb extender is placed on the end of a thumb or finger and extends the reach (left) by 0.6inches (1.5cm). A black conductor at the end (right) ensures its touch is registered on the screen. The device retails for £8.51 ($13.93) and weighs 0.024lbs (11g)

The gadget is somewhat reminiscent of the 'Fing-Longer' from the TV show Futurama. In the episode 'Anthology of Interest I' Professor Farnsworth (picutred) uses a 'What If' machine to humourously imagine how useful a device might have been - if he ever invented it

The company said this is especially useful for commuters travelling by train who often stand up while holding onto a handrail.

Attempting to use a larger phone in this scenario can be difficult - a problem they say is solved with this thumb extender.

And it’s not just for the iPhone 6 Plus that the thumb is designed; other larger phones, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, can also make use of it.

‘This wasn’t specifically designed for the new iPhone but for overall smartphones because screen sizes are getting larger and difficult to handle,’ a spokesperson for Thanko Inc told the Wall Street Journal.
