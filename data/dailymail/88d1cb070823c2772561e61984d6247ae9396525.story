MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Wigan Athletic boss Malky Mackay has taken charge of his first training session since his appointment at the Championship outfit.

Mackay, who was confirmed as the new manager of Wigan on Wednesday, will be hoping his side can bounce back from two consecutive defeats on Saturday.

The Latics take on Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium in what will be Mackay’s first game in management since it was exclusively revealed by Sportsmail that he was being investigated by the FA over ‘sexist, racist and homophobic’ text messages.

The ex-Cardiff City manager is still being investigated by the Football Association over the text messages he exchanged with his former head of recruitment Iain Moody.

Mackay stated in his first press conference as Wigan boss that he had apologised for his mistakes and was proud of being handed the opportunity to return to management.

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan said Mackay had been ‘so unlucky’ as he ‘has done a little bit wrong’ and called for fans to back his decision.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp has jumped to the defence of Mackay by insisting the Scotsman 'deserves a second chance' as 'he's not the only person who has made a mistake'.

Redknapp said: 'I get stupid messages from people all the time, silly jokes, sick jokes, I hate them and delete them straight away. But people do tend to do that in life, so he is not the only person who has made a mistake.

'I am sure his life has been hell for the last few months. He realises he has made a massive mistake and hopefully he will not make any more mistakes.

'I am not condoning what he done but he has got another chance. People get second chances in life. Have a look around the world and see what happens, there are people who come out of prison who have murdered people, beat up old ladies - they get second chances.

'I have got a lot of time for Malky, I like him. He has made a mistake but lots of people make mistakes in life. Half the people who judge him have probably made more mistakes.

'It is easy to kick someone when they are down. He has got a second chance now. He has got the backing of the chairman and hopefully he will do well.'

Whelan revealed on Wednesday at Mackay's unveiling that there is a clause in his contract protecting the club if the FA charge him. The FA's investigation is still two or three weeks from conclusion and Redknapp warns that Mackay cannot make the same mistake twice.

'If he does it again he'll be bang in trouble. He knows that,' Redknapp added. 'Whenever I have met Malky, I have thought he was a decent person and a good football manager. He made a big mistake, you can't do what he did, and he has accepted that. He has apologised I am sure he has learned from that.'

Mackay will be hoping he can lead his side to victory in his first game in charge of the club on Saturday
