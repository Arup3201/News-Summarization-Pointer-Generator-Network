No one hunting for a flat expects much for £730-a-month in central London.

And this is the proof.

With a bed squeezed into the five-square-foot kitchen - inches from the hob and sink - this shoebox 'studio' apartment is a snapshot of London's ballooning housing market.

Breathe in: Estate agents have marketed this £730-a-month Islington flat as 'modern' and 'fully contained'

The landlord has optimistically 
manoeuvred a table and chair into the remaining space of the flat in the
 affluent area of Islington, north London.

And the wardrobe blocks the door.

But in the first 24 hours, the estate agents Relocate Me have received a wave of interest from would-be tenants.

It is one of hundreds of flats soaring in price in the capital as experts continue to warn of an imminent housing bubble.

London house prices rose at their fastest rate last month since records began in 1995, to an average of £435,034.

Nearly 1,000 homes every month are now being sold for more than £1million.

Figures reveal that around 30 houses a day are changing hands for seven figure sums – up two-thirds on a year ago.

Interest: The letters have received a lot of interest but were forced to remove the listing to quell the number of abusive phone calls from people berating the price and size of the north London property

The Islington flat was advertised to potential tenants as 'fully self-contained'.

It claims to have an en-suite bathroom - not pictured - and access to a shared roof terrace.

Despite being 'within walking distance' of London hotspots such as Angel and King's Cross, property hunters could get a five-bedroom house for the same price just a mile away.

Though still marketing the property, Relocate Me has been forced to take down their listing from rightmove.co.uk in a bid to quell the deluge of 'abusive' phone calls berating the price and size as 'unreasonable'.

A member of staff, who would not be named, said: 'We just had to take it down. People have been calling up swearing and saying bad things.

'We have taken it down until we can get better marketing images or refurbish.

'It is small but it is good value for money. Nowadays, people living in London have to just go for what they can afford, and this is in a good location.'
