This is the society fixer alleged to have helped find underage girls for pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein - helping Bill Clinton celebrate his daughter's marriage.

Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed at the former First Daughter's glittering July 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky - despite Epstein having been convicted of soliciting underage girls.

Clinton had cut ties to Epstein after his arrest over allegations of sex with girls as young as 14.

But this photograph shows that he maintained close ties to Maxwell, who is accused in court papers of procuring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, as she smiles as President Clinton walks a beaming Chelsea down the aisle.

Friends in high places: Ghislaine Maxwell is a good friend of President Bill Clinton and can be seen on the right at his daughter Chelsea's wedding in July 2010

Maxwell, now 50, attended the wedding in Rhinebeck, NY, on July 31, 2010, with the cream of Washington D.C. 

Described as feeling like a 'family wedding', guests included former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Terry McAuliffe, Governor of Virginia, and leading figure in the civil rights movement Vernon Jordan.

For Maxwell to remain a Clinton chum is an interesting turn of events.

Just two years earlier, her former lover and friend Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after pleading to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months in prison.

President Clinton had been so close to both to Epstein he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on his private Caribbean island.

Speaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, Virginia Roberts - who claims in court papers she was kept as Epstein's 'sex slave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times  - said she met President Clinton twice, but was never 'lent out'.

Buckingham Palace vehemently denies the claims, as does Maxwell. Her legal team stresses she was not involved in, or connected to the criminal proceedings against Epstein and with regards to Virginia Roberts' claims, they stressed she denies each and every allegation. 

Virginia, now a married mother of three, claimed that President Clinton traveled with Epstein to a number of destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s private jet, and enjoyed intimate dinners with both him and Maxwell.

On one occasion, she said that Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat Kevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’.

Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party, also flew with President Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. 

On one occasion, she alleged, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his island for President Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did not take the bait.

‘I’d have been about 17 at the time,’ she said: ‘I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.

‘She’d always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take lessons, and I remember she was very excited because she got her licence around the first year we met.

'I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember him talking about what a good job she did.

‘I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were good friends.

'I asked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as Bill and [Prince] Andrew weren’t more careful.'

She said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at President Clinton's left, while they were joined by two 'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown in from New York.

Virginia claimed: 'I’d never met them before. I’d say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking.

‘They weren’t there for me. They weren’t there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex with Jeffrey on the trip.

‘Maybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in them. He and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny

'He made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes listened politely and giggled.

Indeed, the trio were so close that DailyMail.com told last week how Epstein kept 21 numbers for President Clinton in his contacts book, under the name of his adviser Doug Band. 

As Virginia Roberts' astonishing claims have made headlines around the world, it was reported last week that President Clinton's continuing friendship with Maxwell has caused a rift between him and his wife, potential Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 

However, the pair were pictured looking cosy together as they left the funeral of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo.

Epstein and Maxwell met shortly after she moved to New York in the 1990s following the death of her father, shamed newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.

And they remained just as close even after an initial romance faded.

For Epstein, Maxwell was a useful conduit to some of the most powerful people in the world, from PresidentClinton to Prince Andrew. 

Close: Not only was Ghislaine Maxwell friends with Prince Andrew, but his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson as well. The pair are pictured together at the opening of the Asprey Flagship Store on 5th Avenue on December 8, 2003, in New York City

Allegations: Ghislaine Maxwell is accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein'. Above, Miss Maxwell looks on as Prince Andrew smiles with Virginia Roberts in 2001

While Maxwell became used to the luxuries that Epstein could afford her, trips by private jet and his very own Caribbean island. 

Rarely photographed or seen out in public unlike his friend Maxwell, Esptein was however pictured with the brunette as they partied the night away on March 15, 2005, at a Manhattan charity event featuring singer Rod Stewart.

But as they socialized with the cream of Manhattan society, including CBS President Les Moonves, his wife Julie Chen, Sean Lennon and Padma Lakshmi, at the Wall Street Rising event, Epstein, now 63, and Maxwell, would have been entirely unaware of a police probe that was launched that very day. 

In May 2006, a 'probable cause affidavit' revealed that Epstein was the subject of an 11-month undercover investigation by police after a complaint in 2005 from the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl, who claimed she was paid $300 to give him an erotic massage at his flamingo-pink villa in Palm Beach.

The girl is said to have been taken there by 18-year-old student Haley Robson, who claims in a sworn statement that she was recruited at the age of 17 to provide the billionaire with a $200 nude massage. 

One of the girls ‘cried hysterically’, according to a police report, as she recalled how she was recruited to provide services for Epstein when she was 16.

She claims in a sworn statement that he introduced her to a woman whom he said he had brought from Yugoslavia ‘to be his sex slave’. 

Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a minor - a minor in the US is someone younger than 18 - and served 13 months in prison.

Now, lawyers for four of Epstein's alleged victims are fighting to get a federal non-prosecution agreement against Epstein thrown out so he can potentially face criminal charges for allegedly sexually abusing the women, one of whom says she was only 13 at the time of the assault. 

Bizarrely, Maxwell was initially served with a subpoena in September 2009, as she was leaving the Clinton Global Initiatives Conference in New York.

As for Maxwell, bizarrely, she was initially served with a subpoena in September 2009, as she was leaving the Clinton Global Initiatives Conference in New York, and continues to deny all allegations made against her.
