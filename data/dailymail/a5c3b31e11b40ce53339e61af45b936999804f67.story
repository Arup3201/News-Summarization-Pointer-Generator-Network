In the few days it has been live, website CornellFetch has garnered more than 1 million hits and resounding disapproval from the media and community alike.

The website uses pictures of Cornell University's sorority members gathered from their Facebook pages and directs guests who enter the website to vote on one of two pictures. After that, another two pictures appear. 

The site exhorts users to gain 1,000 points (10 points is gained for every vote) - although there's apparently nothing to be gained by accumulating the points.

CornellFetch, begun by male undergraduate students at the Ivy League Cornell University in Ithaca, purports to be data-gathering experiment on 'sorority hierarchy'.

But the website is being criticized for being an online ranking system where users vote on members of the university's sororities based on attractiveness.

One of the site's creators told Jezebel that there exists in the school an unspoken 'sorority hierarchy', and that the women on the site will be judged accordingly.

'All we're doing is formalizing an unspoken consensus. We're not saying this general perception is right or even fair. We're just saying it exists,' he said.

Despite posting their female peers' photographs and sorority information online, the creators have chosen to remain anonymous - a  choice they didn't grant to the hundreds of young women whose appearances are now being judged.

According to a Cornell University spokesperson, the school does not condone the website and is hoping its creators will take it down.

'Thankfully, in the past we've found that responsible members of the online community, at Cornell and beyond, are most effective at self-regulating these kinds of sites,' John Carberry, director of press relations, said in an email to the Cornell Sun.

'Let's hope history repeats itself in this case.'

The website's creators plan to eventually remove sorority affiliations, then release all their data to show whether users voted more for a woman based on her looks or on her sorority house.

It's unclear what the point of having these results would be or at which point the fraternity brothers intend to take the website down.

Unimpressed: University officials are hoping the creators of CornellFetch remove the website

For women who want to have their pictures removed from the site, there's an online form, but one of the website's creators told the Huffington Post that it will take time to remove the images.

Haillie Crockett, class of 2015, told the Cornell Sun that she found the site to be 'childish, objectifying and completely unnecessary,' after discovering her own picture on the site.

'Anyone who logs on to it is going to think it's about rating people by their looks and chapter affiliation. While a Cornell student will know a few of these people, which will influence their decision, they won't know the majority of them, so the "winner" most times will come down to looks,' Crockett said.

'I thought we left ranking popularity in high school.'

Crockett said she immediately emailed the website to request her picture be removed from the site.

Gauging from reactions, it looks like the anonymous fraternity brothers will be just as busy over the coming days removing women's pictures from the site as they are gathering their important data.
