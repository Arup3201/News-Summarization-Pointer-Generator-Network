From her outrageously tiny waist to her unfeasibly long legs, the world's most famous doll has long been the target of criticism from feminists and other women's groups who say it promotes an unhealthy idea of body image in girls.

And now it appears that their claims have been proven. Scaled up to human size, Barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33.

The average woman, meanwhile, has 38 inch back, a 34 inch waist and hips that measure 40 inches around.

Interestingly, although originally based on 1950s pin-ups such as Betty Grable, Barbie is far thinner and more unrealistic, with Grable herself reported to have had measurements of 36-24-35.

Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone, 8lbs - and would have a BMI of 16.24. This would fit the weight criteria for anorexia.

By comparison, the average fashion model has a waist measuring 24 inches, 34-inch hips and a 34-inch bust.

To illustrate the point, illustrator Nickolay Lamm created computer generated images of a scaled up Barbie and compared them with a model that reflected the proportions of an average 19-year-old woman.

'If a woman existed with Barbie proportions, what would she look like compared to a normal woman with average body proportions?' asked Lamm on his blog at MyVoucherCodes.co.uk.

Along with Barbie's ridiculously nipped in waist, the computer model revealed that a real Barbie would have a neck too thin to hold up her head - just 9 inches, compared with the teenager's 15.

What's more, while the average 19-year-old is a modest 5ft 4" tall, Barbie would have a supermodel stature and would be a relatively lofty 5ft 8".

Certainly realistic proportions were not at the top of maker Mattel's agenda when the doll first made an appearance in the 1950s

'Some people say that Barbie is just a toy and that we shouldn't pay so much attention to her body proportions,' Lamm told the Huffington Post.

'However, if skinny models in advertisements get so much scrutiny, I feel Barbie, a doll which million of girls play with, should be open to critique as well.

'Yes, Barbie is just a toy. At the same time, it’s a toy which young girls play with and want to be like.

'If we assume that Barbie is 19 years old, shouldn’t girls have access to toys which resemble realistic proportions?'

Certainly realistic proportions were not at the top of maker Mattel's agenda when the doll first made an appearance in the 1950s.

A particularly troubling example from 1965 was Slumber Party Barbie who came with a set of pink bathroom scales, permanently set to a rather scrawny 110lbs (50kg), and a diet book containing a single instruction on how to lose weight that read: 'DON'T EAT!'

More recently, artist Jason Freeny created a model of the doll that revealed how her unnatural proportions would result in painful deformities, including squashed and misshaped organs because of her unlikely shape.

Lamm, meanwhile, has also created images of Barbie without her customary layers of make-up, which he says look better than the original.

'I decided to see what Barbie (and other dolls) really looked like without makeup. [The original picture] got me thinking: is this what Barbie would really look like without make-up?

'Ken is a pretty good looking doll. So, surely Barbie without make-up can't be too different. Sure enough, Barbie still looks pretty, even au naturel.'

'The real Barbie without make-up brings up a new point: if Barbie can look good without makeup, why doesn't Mattel make dolls with a more natural look?'
