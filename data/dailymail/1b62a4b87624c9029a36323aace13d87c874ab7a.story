Half of voters think Labour should ditch Ed Miliband before the general election, according to the latest poll which will make grim reading for the under-pressure leader.

In a damning assessment of his hopes of winning the election, even 43 per cent of Labour supporters think Mr Miliband should go.

It comes after a separate survey revealed his personal ratings have plummeted to a record low, worse even than Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. 

Ed Miliband's personal ratings have plummeted from a high of -12 two years ago to a new low of -39

Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking at Prime Minister's Questions today, has been hit by a run of bad polls

Labour remains ahead in the opinion polls, but the dire public perception of the leader will alarm party strategists who fear voters do not see Mr Miliband as a potential Prime Minister.

An IpsosMORI survey found 49 per cent of all voters think Mr Miliband should be ousted, including 43 per cent of Labour backers, the Standard reported.

The figures are worse than both the Lib Dem and Tory leaders. Only 44 per cent think Mr Clegg should be given the boot, while just 27 per think the Conservatives should ditch David Cameron.

Just 22 per cent of those surveyed think Mr Miliband is 'ready to be Prime Minister', down from 24 per cent last year.  

The Labour  leader is under intense pressure from his MPs and party members with less than a year until the general election.

After a run of PR gaffes, Mr Miliband’s net satisfaction rating has dropped to -39, even worse than Mr Clegg’s -37 points. 

Last week he was forced to apologise for posing with a copy of The Sun, after MPs and councillors from Liverpool complained about the newspaper’s history of reporting on the Hillsborough disaster.

It followed car crash TV and radio interviews in which Mr Miliband stumbled on grocery bills and local Labour councillors, and a notorious picture of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich.

Just 22 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband is doing a 'good job', the lowest figure of any of the party leaders

David Cameron enjoys the best ratings of any leader, with UKIP leader Nigel Farage close behind

The latest ICM poll for The Guardian yesterday put Labour on 32 per cent, ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent, UKIP on 16 and the Lib Dems on just 10.

But when asked if the leaders are doing a good or bad job, David Cameron is well ahead.

Some 42 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is doing a good job, with 47 per cent saying he is doing a bad job, giving him a net rating of -5.

By comparison, just 22 per cent of people rated Mr Miliband as doing a good job - the worst of all the leaders - while 61 per cent said a bad job. It means he has a net rating of a woeful -39 points.

One in four people - 25 per cent - said Mr Clegg was doing a good job and 62 per cent a bad job, giving a net rating of -37.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is just behind Mr Cameron with a net rating of -8 points.
