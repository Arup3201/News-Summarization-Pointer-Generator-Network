Tony Matthews, 66, died after he was admitted to hospital and put in a store room because they ran out of beds

A hospital left a terminally-ill grandfather to die in a windowless store room a grieving widow has claimed. 

Tony Matthews, 66, spent the last hours of his life in a cramped room with 'glaring fluorescent light' as he suffered with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer. 

The grandfather-of-three was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital after falling ill at home but when he arrived he was told they did not have enough beds.

Staff converted a store cupboard into a makeshift bedroom so he could be given privacy and pain relief in his final hours. 

He was accompanied by his wife Beryl, 66, and passed away three days after being admitted to hospital.

Mrs Matthews said: 'I was told they hadn't got enough beds and so they had to convert store cupboards to make another bedroom.

'There was no window and a horrible fluorescent light which you couldn't dim and so it was only on bright or you sat in the darkness with just the light from the corridor.

'I just think he deserved better. He had this awful disease and he and I were very, very badly let down by the hospital.'

She added that the lack of facilities meant she had returned home for a shower and was not at his side when he died.

'I feel as though I let him down as I'd promised I would be with him and I wasn't able to be there.

'They denied me the chance of being there at the end.'

Mrs Matthews said she and her cousin were given permission to stay in the store room with him after he was admitted to hospital on November 4.

To try and make him more comfortable they asked hospital staff for an extra pillow only to be told there were none available.

They were also told they were not allowed a mattress and would have to sleep in their chairs if they wanted to stay in the room.

Mrs Matthews stayed at the hospital for two nights but returned to her home in Attleborough in Norfolk, on November 6 for a shower.

Later that evening she was contacted by the ward to tell her Mr Matthews' condition had deteriorated and she returned to the hospital to find he had died ten minutes earlier.

Mesothelioma is a cancer of membrane cells which line major organs. It occurs most often in tissue around the lungs.

Symptoms of the disease include acute chest pains, such as Mrs Allen suffered, a persistent cough and difficulty breathing, high temperatures and weight loss.

More than 2,500 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year, with five times more men than women falling victim.

According to the NHS, the disease is 'almost always' caused by asbestos, and takes 20 to 60 years to develop after the initial exposure.

The cancer can be difficult to diagnose accurately, as affected cells do not look distinctive.

Chemotherapy is the main treatment. Some surgical procedures are being investigated, but remain unproven.

Because mesothelioma is so difficult to diagnose, it is often terminal by the time doctors notice. Patients rarely survive more than three years after diagnosis. The average is 12 months.

Some 2,300 per year die of the disease, though experts expect this to increase as more workers exposed to asbestos in past decades are affected.

By 2050, it is thought the cancer will have taken 90,000 lives.

She added that the staff at the hospital had done what they could but questioned whether they were being given the right resources to do their job.

'They did a really good job of making sure he got pain relief towards the end,' she said.

'The staff were brilliant and they did whatever they could but they were limited.'

Director of Nursing Emma McKay said: 'Mrs Matthews has raised concerns about the side room used on the ward.

'This room was chosen to provide greater privacy for the patient and family than would be afforded on the ward bays.

'We will be looking at the lighting in the room to see if changes can be made or a lamp can be installed to enable the lighting to be adjusted.

'A reclining chair was made available to allow Mrs Matthews to rest and while she spent time with her husband.

'We will take on board all the issues that have been raised and will be making changes where possible to improve the care we provide.'

Mr Matthews' death comes a month after another patient at the hospital spent nine hours recovering from a serious infection in one of their store rooms.

Ian Semmons, 65, claims he was disturbed through the night by apologetic nurses needing medical supplies.

The hospital's chief executive since 2008, Anna Dugdale, admitted she would not allow her mother to be treated at the £229m hospital. 

Ms Dugdale said that drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced them to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions.
