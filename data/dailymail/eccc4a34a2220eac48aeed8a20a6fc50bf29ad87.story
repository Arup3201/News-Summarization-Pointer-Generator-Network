Lionel Messi, Angel di Maria and Sergio Aguero seemed to be enjoying their preparations in Beijing for Argentina's glamour friendly with Brazil.

Gerardo Martino leads his new side against Dunga's Samba stars on Saturday in the Chinese capital.

And ahead of the match, the former Barcelona coach says there is no greater rivalry in world football than the South American clash.

'We will try to do what we did against Germany,' he said.

'Brazil won't change their tactics, although the new coach called up a lot different players.

'Argentina against Brazil is the most important derby between national teams. It doesn't matter where the match is held, it's always important for the history between us and now also for the players.'

Messi and Co were mobbed by fans as they arrived in the Far East, while Di Maria will be hoping to continue his fine Manchester United form.
