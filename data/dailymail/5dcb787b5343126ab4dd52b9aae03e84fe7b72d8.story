It’s Britain’s busiest motorway - and became ‘the world's biggest car park’ thanks to its regular jams.

But drivers who break the speed limit on the M25 are in very little danger of being slapped with a fine - because many cameras monitoring the road have allegedly not worked for five years.

The cameras are behind overhead signs telling motorists to reduce their speed to 60, 50 or 40mph at certain times - but officials have failed to switch them on since their installation started in 2009.

The cameras only work on a three-mile section of the 117-mile London Orbital road between junction 2 and 3 - just south of the Dartford Crossing in Kent, reported the Sunday People.

Problems have plagued the others - with cameras installed without approval that their images could be used as evidence in court, and monitoring responsibility changing hands between police forces.

But average speed cameras at roadwork sites operate - and the Highways Agency said cameras on sections between junction 10 in Surrey and 16 in Buckinghamshire will be working by the summer.

However, the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety’s executive director, David Davies, said the fiasco of switched-off cameras was a ‘cock-up’ that needed to be resolved.

He told the Sunday People: ‘It’s poor 
that it’s gone on for so long. It’s also a waste of money. The National 
Audit Office should have a look at this.’

A Highways Agency spokesman told 
MailOnline: 'Sections of the M25 where mandatory speed limits are 
displayed in red rings have continued to work effectively to reduce 
congestion and smooth traffic flow, and have operated well without fixed
 camera enforcement.

'We are
 working with Surrey Police, who are taking responsibility between 
junctions 10 and 16, to resume enforcement. The speed limits are 
enforceable by the police and the cameras will be operational by summer 
2014.'

'It's poor that it's gone on for so long. It's also a waste of money'

David Davies, Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety

Edmund King, president of The AA, added that successive transport secretaries have spoken of changing the speed limits on motorways – which is ‘ironic’ considering the speed limit is not enforced on sections of the M25.

Laura Woods, from the road safety charity Brake, told
MailOnline: ‘Speeding kills: the faster you are travelling, the less chance you
can stop in time for an emergency, and the more damage you’ll do in a crash.

‘Speed cameras are an essential tool for discouraging
speeding on motorways, and catching drivers who take this appalling risk.

‘It is therefore very concerning that these speed cameras
have been left switched off for such a long period, meaning that many drivers
who have risked lives by breaking the speed limit will have got away with their
dangerous and selfish actions.’
