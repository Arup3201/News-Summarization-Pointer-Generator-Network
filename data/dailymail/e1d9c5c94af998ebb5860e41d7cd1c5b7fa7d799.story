As president and CEO of Yahoo! 
Marissa Mayer is one of the most powerful businesswomen in the 
country but unfortunately that doesn’t mean that she's immune to having sexist remarks said to her in public.

Mayer was on a panel at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, her first since joining last year, when the moderator asked for questions from the audience.

One
 investor chose to inform the entire audience that he was less 
interested in what Mayer had to say about innovation and was more 
interested in her appearance.

Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer was on the panel of her first annual shareholder meeting when a man told the entire room that he found her attractive

‘This
 is my personal opinion. First is I'm George Polis, I have 2,000 shares 
in Yahoo!, I'm Greek and I'm a dirty old man and you look attractive 
Marissa,’ said the shareholder who then went on to complain about the 
lack of dividend the company had paid out in recent years.

Mayer
 refused to rise to the old fool’s bait and another Yahoo! executive 
proceeded to respond to his second question about dividends, while there
 was embarrassed laughter from the event’s moderator.

Mayer took over the £16 billion company last July and quickly made headlines when she decided to ban telecommuting and then had a nursery built next to her office for her baby daughter.

Earlier this year she featured in Makers, a PBS/AOL documentary about the 'women who make America.' In it Mayer said she doesn't consider herself a feminist
 and that she believes feminism has become a 'more negative word.'

In the film Mayer says: 'I don’t think that I would consider myself a feminist. I think that, I certainly believe in equal rights. I believe that women are just as capable, if not more so, in a lot of different dimensions.

'But I don’t, I think, have sort of the militant drive and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that. And I think it’s too bad, but I do think feminism has become, in many ways, a more negative word.

'There are amazing opportunities all over the world for women, and I think that there’s more good that comes out of positive energy around that than negative energy,' says Mayer. 

As Business Insider points out, women still earn less than men at every level of education, and women hold just 17 percent of senior management roles in the U.S.

Mayer banned working from home after she noted that workers had not been logging on enough.

Career move: On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, which is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, near San Jose

Mayer's
 decision sparked an outcry from working mothers and other companies in 
Silicon Valley who blasted the hypocrisy of her banning the action but 
allowing herself an in-office space for her child.

The company headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California, near San Jose. The public corporation employs 11,500 people in more than 20 countries across the globe.

Mayer, a 37-year-old Silicon Valley whiz kid who was previously a big deal at Google before switching to the competition, was appointed the head of Yahoo in July 2012.

She instituted free lunches at the company headquarters and started giving out smartphones to employees.

'I want Yahoo to be the absolute best place to work, to have a fantastic culture. We're working really hard right now to remind people about all the opportunities that are there,' she said shortly after she was hired at a Fortune magazine event in November.
