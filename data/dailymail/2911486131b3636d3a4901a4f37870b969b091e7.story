A sheriff who was murdered earlier this year was allegedly shot dead by a male gunman that he raped as a teenager.

Eugene Crum, 59, was shot dead in his police cruiser as he sat eating lunch in April, three months after taking up his post in Mingo County, West Virginia.

Tennis Maynard, 37, is suspected of killing the sheriff. However his family have claimed that the shooting was motivated by the fact that Maynard was raped by Crum when he was a teenager.

Murky dealings: Mingo County Judge Michael Thornsbury is being investigated for corruption

It is alleged that Crum raped a 19-year-old woman in 2002 in the back of a police cruiser while two officers sat in the front, turning up the radio to cover up the attack.

The allegations are part of a wider investigation this week into the murky world of Mingo 
County where allegations of murder, public corruption, illegal drugs, moonshine and 
illicit affairs have rumbled for decades.[

This
 Wednesday, the county's only judge for the past 15 years is set to 
admit that he was part of a scheme to ruin an FBI investigation into 
goings-on - again involving Crum's alleged drug habit.

Judge Michael Thornsbury' startling admissions is the latest development into the downfall of what was known among local people in Mingo County as the 'courthouse gang'.  

Steven Ruby, an assistant U.S. Attorney involved in the investigation told TPM: 'Our investigation of public corruption in Mingo County at this point is ongoing.

'At
 this point, it would be premature to indicate how many targets or how 
many subjects of the investigation might exist, but we can certainly say
 that the investigation is very much continuing.'

The
 allegations regarding Crum and Thornsbury came to light after a local 
businessman George White planned to tell the FBI about their corrupt 
dealings including drug taking and bending electoral law while Crum ran for sheriff.

In 2012, White a local sign-maker who often did work for political campaigns, did some work for Crum.

When
 the local businessman was left being owed $3,000, prosecutors claim 
that the sheriff arranged for White to be set up in a drug deal 
involving oxycodone tablets - known on the street as 'hillbilly heroin'.

White in turn alleged that Crum had previously bought pills from him illegally, adding that the law enforcement officer had also sold him moonshine.

When it became clear to the sheriff and other members of his 'courthouse gang' that White was speaking to the FBI, they came up with a plan to silence him.

Crum, Thornsbury and two other officials then allegedly told White, according to Talking Points, that if he cut off contact with the FBI, a deal could be reached about the prescription drugs.

White is currently in jail while county prosecutor Michael Sparks has denied being part of the conspiracy - and has taken himself off the investigation into Crum's murder.

Judge Thornsbury's cooperation with the FBI means that another case against him - involving using his powers as a judge to make frame a former mistress's husband - will be dropped.

Sheriff Crum's funeral was attended by hundreds of mourners earlier this year, including nearly 400 law enforcement officers from several states. Judge Thornsbury spoke at his friend's funeral.

'We ask all the time where have all 
the heroes gone?' Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury said 
during his eulogy. 'Let me tell you, sometimes we walk in their midst 
and we don't know we got them. He was mine.'

At the time, county prosecutor Michael Sparks said there was no substantial 
evidence that Crum's death was drug-related, Thornsbury claimed Crum had 
received threats due to his job.

Thornsbury said: 'He was aware he was being persecuted by some, but the saving grace was that he knew he was loved by many.'

The last conversation Thornsbury had with Crum included those job risks and occurred just a few minutes before his death.

'He looked at me and he said, "I'm going to fight the good fight,'" Thornsbury said. And with that, Crum left for lunch.

He was shot as he ate in a downtown Williamson parking lot on April 3.
