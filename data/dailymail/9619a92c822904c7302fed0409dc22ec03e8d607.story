Virginity pledges have long been a contentious subject, and now a new study has shown that they may do more harm than good.

According to findings recently published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies, only people who have genuinely strong religious beliefs actually keep their promise.

For others - even those who attend church regularly but don't consider themselves devout - virginity pledges are more often broken, leading to risky behavior and a greater likelihood of having unprotected sex.

Saving themselves: A new study has found only people with truly strong religious beliefs keep their virginity pledges. Those who are religiously committed but not devout are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior

The study involved 1,380 students between the ages of 18 and 24, all of whom attended a 'large, public Southeastern state university'.

When the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their sexual behavior, more than a quarter said they had signed a virginity pledge - which is about the same as the statistic nationwide among young people in that age group.

The problem arises when those who aren't totally committed break their vow; if they haven't had comprehensive sex education, they have little incentive not to have unprotected sex.

'For pledge signers with low religious commitment, there are unintended negative consequences with regard to increased participation in risky sexual behaviors,' reads the study.

It also found that these people are even more likely to engage in dangerous sexual behavior than people of the same age who have never taken such a pledge.

A study published in the Pediatrics journal 2008 had similar results; it found that more than half of young people become sexually active before marriage regardless of whether or not they have taken a pledge.

However, while 34per cent of people who do not take a pledge say they always used a condom, only 24per cent of those who have taken a pledge said the same.

'Taking a pledge doesn't seem to make any difference at all in any sexual behavior,' said Janet E Rosenbaum, one of the authors of the report.

'But it does seem to make a difference in condom use and other forms of birth control that is quite striking.'
