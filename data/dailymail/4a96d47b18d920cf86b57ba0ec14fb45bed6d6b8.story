It is not an airline often associated with comfort.

So it will perhaps surprise some travellers to learn that Ryanair can actually lay claim to providing its passengers with more legroom than most of its rivals.

The budget airline's smallest seats were behind only British Airways and Aer Lingus in offering the most room among Britain’s airlines.

Ryanair has signed a £13bn deal to buy up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 planes, which will include slimmer seats and reduced galley space to fit in eight additional seats

The Irish carrier boasts between 30 and 34ins of leg space in its economy-class seats compared to easyJet with 29ins, Thomas Cook with between 28 and 30ins and Monarch with 28-34ins.

Thomson flights offer between 28-34ins while Aer Lingus provided 31-32ins and British Airways between 31 and 34ins, according to review site SeatGuru.com.

The airline, which has been much maligned by passengers over the years for its poor customer service, has seat widths of 17ins on its Boeing 737-800 jets - only narrowly smaller than British Airways who offer up to 18ins in its economy class cabins.

The width of easyJet's seats are 18ins, slightly wider than Ryanair and the same as British Airways

Monarch was revealed to have the smallest seat widths at 16.25-17.5ins.

The figures are revealed at a time when seat space on flights has become a controversial issue after a spate of air rage incidents were reported on US flights in recent weeks.

                          Legroom (inches)   Seat width 

British Airways         31-34                   18

Aer Lingus                31-32                   17 

Ryanair                      30-34                   17 

easyJet                         29                     18 

Thomson                   28-34             16.5-17.2 

Monarch                   28-34            16.25-17.5 

Thomas Cook           28-30                   17  

Rows between passengers over legroom forced three pilots to divert planes, while the International Air Transport Association said its members reported a 'clear, general upward trend in instances of unruly and disruptive behaviour on board aircraft' around the world last year.

On Monday, Ryanair signed a £13billion deal to buy up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 planes, a new design which includes slimmer seats and reduced galley space which will be able to squeeze additional seats into the American plane maker's popular single-aisle aircraft.

They will feature a total of 197 seats – eight more than the 189 seats possible in the 737-800 planes currently being used.

The airline also said the new configuration would provide passengers with even more legroom than the average of 30ins on its current fleet, although it did not reveal exactly how much more legroom would be available.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said the extra seats would generate almost £1m of additional revenue per plane per year.

British Airways offers its passengers between 31in and 34in of legroom in its economy class cabins

Ryanair's deal to buy the new planes, which are set to arrive in 2019, are part of O'Leary’s plan to expand their flights to accommodate 150million passengers each year by 2024.

The company has grown from a single Ireland-England service in 1985 to the biggest short-haul airline in Europe today, currently carrying more than 80 million customers annually.

While customers say they like the Ryanair's cheap ticket prices and huge selection of destinations across Europe, they have frequently vented their frustration over poor customer service.

It was last year that consumer magazine Which? published a survey of more than 3,300 readers that placed Ryanair last among 100 top brands in quality of customer service.
