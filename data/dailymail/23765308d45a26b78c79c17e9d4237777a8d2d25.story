The Archbishop of Canterbury rowed back on a suggestion that popular church schools are planning to admit more pupils from non-churchgoing families

The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday rowed back on a suggestion that popular church schools are planning to admit more pupils from non-churchgoing families.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said that remarks on Church schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not ‘be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy'.

The retreat followed his assurance to journalists that ‘there’s a steady move away from faith-based entry tests’ for children hoping for places at Church of England’s schools.

It was the third occasion in nine months in which Archbishop Welby has made a controversial statement, only to soften his line later in the face of wide publicity.

In March he modified his criticism of the Government over benefit reforms and during the summer, and during the summer the Archbishop struck out at payday lenders, only to have to admit a ‘serious inconsistency’ when it was discovered that the CofE held investments in Wonga.

Archbishop Welby’s views on changes in Church schools were given to The Times during a conference held by the CofE charity the Church Urban Fund.

The paper reported that he said: ‘What you are seeing in the Church schools is a deeper and deeper commitment to the common good.

‘There’s a steady move away from faith-based entry tests.’

CofE schools - the Church is responsible for one in four primaries and one in 25 state secondary schools - have a high reputation and middle-class parents are often anxious to win places for their children.

Families are frequently accused of filling the pews on Sunday mornings to solely to impress vicars, who give preference to regular churchgoers. Critics say the system encourages hypocrisy and is a form of selection, because it favours the children of largely middle class congregations.

Archbishop Welby - an old Etonian whose five children went to state schools - told The Times: ‘It is not necessary to select to get a really good school.

‘There are unbelievably brilliant schools that are entirely open to all applicants without selection criteria apart from residence, where you live, and which produce staggeringly good results.

‘It’s a question of - and you can point to them all over the place - it’s a question of outstanding leadership.’

However shortly after his remarks were published, the Archbishop reversed direction.

He put out a statement that said: ‘I fully support the current policy for schools to set their own admissions criteria, including the criterion of faith. Nothing in my wider comments to The Times on this subject should be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy.’

The statement left a question mark over Archbishop Welby’s thinking and provoked demands for reform from critics of the selection procedures of church schools.

The Accord Coalition, which aims to remove ‘religious discrimination’ from school admissions, said the CofE should fulfil promises to keep a quarter of school places open for non-churchgoing families, and re-write its guidance on admissions to encourage the acceptance of pupils from a wider range of backgrounds.

The group’s spokesman, Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, said: ‘The Archbishop’s comment that schools better serve the common good by being open in their admissions, is a breath of fresh air.

However, the Church has made commitments towards greater inclusivity at its schools in recent years, but not delivered, and it remains to be seen whether church schools really are shifting in their approach in pupil admissions.

‘The Church needs to offer clear leadership to bring about a lasting cultural change.’ 

Justin Welby said that remarks on Church schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not 'be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy'

In March Archbishop Welby opposed the Government’s one per cent cap on benefit increases, saying: ‘These changes will mean it is children and families who will pay the price for high inflation, rather than the Government. Politicians have a clear choice. By protecting children from the effects of this Bill, they can help fulfil their commitment to end child poverty.’

However, hours afterwards, he wrote a blog on the Lambeth Palace website which sounded a different note.

‘It’s a very complicated area, and the first thing to say is that the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, has spent hard years turning himself into a leading and principled expert on welfare, its effects and shortcomings,’ the Archbishop said in the blog.

‘He is introducing one of the biggest and most thorough reforms of a system that most people admit is shot full of holes, wrong incentives, and incredible complexity.’

In July the Archbishop attacked payday lenders, saying: ‘I’ve met the head of Wonga and we had a very good conversation and I said to him quite bluntly, “We’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we’re trying to compete you out of existence”.’

Shortly afterwards a newspaper reported that the Church Commissioners, the financial arm of the CofE, had money in one of Wonga’s major backers.

Lambeth Palace said: ‘We are grateful to the Financial Times for pointing out this serious inconsistency of which we were unaware. ‘We will be asking the assets committee of the Church Commissioners to investigate how this has occurred and to review the holding.’
