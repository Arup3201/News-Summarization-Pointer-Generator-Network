Pushy foreign parents desperate to get their children into top boarding schools in Britain are taking drastic measures to secure their places. 

One determined Chinese mother tried to send hundreds of Harrods hampers to newcomers at Eton, while a Brazilian man whose son had missed the deadline to apply pulled a handgun on an educational consultant. 

Others tried to buy cars for teachers or give more money than owed when the annual fees were due, it has been revealed.

Pushy foreign parents are going to new lengths to try to secure their sons places at the famous boarding school 

Their desperate efforts were exposed by an educational consultant who insists the rules can be bent for no one.  

Rupert Syme, head of Lionheart Education, which runs a consultancy, tutoring agency and school, said told the Times: 'I can't even start the process of getting your child into Eton if you miss the registration date even if you point a handgun at me in my own office as per one enraged overseas gentleman.

'If the hundreds of UK-based parents we advise every year feel the need for help, it is hardly surprising that overseas parents want the same.

'The problem is that many agents within the UK see international parents as a "cash cow"'. 

In November it was revealed more than 1,000 pupils had sought entry to Eton - a record number of applications for the famous school. 

Princes William and Harry attended the exclusive school where the number of applications continues to rise every year

The school's tutor for admissions said at the time he feared boys were being over prepared for their entrance exams. 

He warned parents against 'allowing your son to be prepared' for Eton’s interview and entry test, saying the school did not want 'the boys to sound like mini-adults'.
