Wayne Rooney admits his place in the England team is not guaranteed ahead of Thursday’s crucial clash with Uruguay.

Roy Hodgson and his players feel they must beat the South Americans to regain control of their World Cup destiny after Saturday’s 2-1 loss to Italy.

With Hodgson confident that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be available after a knee injury, Rooney’s starting place cannot be taken for granted.

‘I’ve never felt that,’ said Rooney. ‘Why would I feel my place in the team is guaranteed? I work hard to try and get into that team. I’ve never said my place is guaranteed. I don’t expect to play.

‘We have got a lot of good, young players. We all give the manager different options and whoever he picks then I’m sure we will all respect that.’

Rooney insisted he made a positive contribution against Italy. ‘I was involved in the game, could have scored, created the goal and I felt I had an influence,’ he said.

Of Thursday’s clash with Uruguay, beaten 3-1 by Costa Rica on Saturday, Rooney said: ‘We need the three points. It will have the feel of a do-or-die game. We know if we lose we are all but out, so we have to be positive.

‘We went at Italy, lost two goals at bad times and couldn’t recover. We didn’t get the result but we are trying to be positive and play the right football. We can win our next two games and will give it a good go.’
