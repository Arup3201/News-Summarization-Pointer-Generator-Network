As the 197th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo is marked  today, a battalion named after the  Duke of Wellington is facing a very modern fight for survival – against the money men of the  Ministry of Defence. 

The Duke of Wellington’s battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment faces the axe under plans to cull Army numbers and disband or merge 50 regiments.

The 300-year-old battalion, fought under its name in the Boer War, both World Wars, Iraq, and its soldiers are currently serving in the volatile Helmand province in Afghanistan.

Facing a mutiny: Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond's plans to scrap the 
Army battalion named after the Duke of Wellington has drawn criticism

The present Duke of Wellington, the 
deputy  colonel-in-chief of the regiment who won the Military Cross in 
the Second World War, has written to the head of the Army, urging that 
the battalion’s name is preserved.

He
 said: ‘The brave soldiers in the battalion,  who are performing so 
magnificently in Afghanistan today, greatly value the link with [the]  
Duke’s family.’

Other war veterans have attacked the plans being pushed by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

Retired
 Major General Patrick Cordingley, who served in the first Gulf War, 
said: ‘We would be better off... making sure we have enough manpower to 
keep up with the sort of problems we could face in the Middle East.’

Yesterday Mr Hammond defended the proposed cuts which are part of a wider strategy to save £38billion over five years.

The
 MoD said any final announcement on the future of the battalion has been
 postponed until its soldiers have returned from Afghanistan.

The
 96-year-old Duke, who won the Military Cross in the Second World War, 
told the Chief of the General Staff that abandoning the name of his 
ancestor, known as the 'Iron Duke' and one of Britain's most famous 
battlefield leaders, would be a grave mistake.

The
 Duke was backed last night by Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, 
chairman of Waterloo 200, a group set up to organise the 2015 
commemoration of the 1815 battle that marked Napoleon’s final defeat.

The
 Major General told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I accept there may have to be 
cuts for financial reasons, but given the prominence of the name 
Wellington in the history of our nation and the Armed Forces, it would 
be extraordinary if it is not  to be preserved.

‘It would be especially contrary when we are approaching the 200th anniversary of Waterloo.

‘The
 brave soldiers in the Duke of Wellington’s battalion, who are  
performing so magnificently in Afghanistan today, greatly value the link
 with the Iron Duke’s family.'

Senior officers were shocked to  be told at a regimental dinner in York last month that Army chiefs have decided that the historic name  will go.

In March, five men of the battalion, together with a sixth from another regiment, were killed by a Taliban bomb in the single worst enemy attack on UK troops in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001.

Earlier this month, Private Gregg Stone, 20, of 3rd Battalion, was killed during a successful raid to free an Afghan policeman taken hostage by the Taliban. His wife Samantha is pregnant with their first child.

The regiment dates back 300 years and fought under Wellington’s  command at Waterloo as the 33rd Regiment, reportedly prompting Napoleon to comment: ‘These English dogs of war never know when they are beaten.’

It was renamed The Duke of  Wellington’s Regiment by Queen Victoria in 1853, the year after the Duke died.

The regiment fought in the American War of Independence, India, the Boer War and in the First World War at the Somme.

In the Second World War it  campaigned in North Africa, Italy, France and Burma. It also took part in the 2003 Iraq War.

Nine of its soldiers have been awarded the Victoria Cross.

Affectionately known as the ‘Dukes’, the regiment was amalgamated with the Prince of Wales’s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and The Green Howards to form the Yorkshire Regiment in 2006.

It became 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington’s).

The Mail on Sunday understands that the Yorkshire Regiment is to  be reduced to two battalions. The 

Ministry of Defence last night denied any final decision had been taken.

A total of 600 of the Yorkshire Regiment’s 1,800 soldiers are expected to lose their jobs, including some from the Duke of Wellington’s battalion.

The row follows Mr Hammond’s decision to reduce the strength  of the Armed Forces from 180,000 to 150,000 over five years as part  of £38 billion of defence savings.

The Army will be cut to 82,000 soldiers. Critics say it means it can no longer be classed as an army but rather a self-defence force, a term often applied to forces numbering fewer than 100,000.

An Army spokesperson said: ‘The Army is currently considering  redesign options. No decisions have been taken.

'The regimental system is fundamental to the fighting power of the British Army today and we are not going to change it.'
