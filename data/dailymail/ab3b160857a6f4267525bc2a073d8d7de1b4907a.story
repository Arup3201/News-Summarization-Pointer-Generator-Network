Sabean Fulcher was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud

An aspiring model who made illegal copies of credit cards in order to buy more than £5,000 worth of designer clothes and shoes walked free from court today.

Sabean Fulcher, 23, spent her fraudulent gains at luxury shoe shops in Knightsbridge such as Jimmy Choo, Ferragam and Christian Louboutin.

She also went to Mayfair shops like Mulberry, Mui Mui and Tod's with three cloned American Express cards, and attempted to spend nearly £9,000 of other people's money.

Fulcher, who describes herself as a 'model, actor and designer' and once appeared in a Katy B music video, was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.

Her lawyer blamed her crimes on a relationship with an older man, telling Southwark Crown Court that Fulcher, from Ealing, had 'simply lost all common sense and integrity'.

Judge Peter Testar said the defendant was merely the public face of a criminal gang, and accepted the argument that she was led astray by her older lover.

'What has happened here is that a gang or group has somehow got involved in obtaining the details of genuine credit card holders and have cloned cards with the details of those genuine credit card holders,' he said.

'[They have] cloned them with your name and you've then been sent out by the group as the one who, no doubt appearing respectable as you did, was to go in to the shops and obtain high value goods.

'The mitigation, which I accept, is that you were involved with some man, no doubt much more criminal than you, and you were required by him to commit these offences.'

Prosecutor James Robottom said 
Fulcher was first arrested after she attempted to buy two pairs of Jimmy
Choo shoes for £1,300 on February 29, 2012.

She tried to use a blue American Express card to pay, and handed over her provisional driving licence as proof of her identity.

'The
card transaction was declined,' said the lawyer. 'The credit card was 
cut up by the sales assistant. The police were called subsequent to 
that.

'The blue American Express card 
attempted to be used corresponded to a genuine U.S. account for a 
Platinum Delta card held by a lady with a billing address in New York. 
The blue one attempted to be used was counterfeit.'

He said the same card had been used to pay for £1,049 worth of shoes in Ferragamo and £799 worth in Christian Loubotin.

The aspiring model bought more than £5,000 worth of designer clothes with three cloned credit cards

Before Fulcher was interviewed by police, she used a second card at Tod's, Mulberry and Miu Miu, according to Mr Robottom.

He said she bought three pairs of driving gloves and a men's leather bag at Tod's, and a £950 black bag from Mulberry.

When was arrested in Miu Miu after 
trying to buy two bags worth £1,025 with a Platinum American Express 
card police discovered a second cloned card in her bag. Both cards were 
registered to genuine accounts in Michigan.

Fulcher pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and was sentenced to 10 months in jail suspended for two years

Mr
Robottom said: 'On the three cards on those days the total attempts 
were worth £8,766 and the total loss to American Express was £5,321.'

Defence counsel Victoria Meads said: 'The circumstances of the offences boil down to a relationship she found herself in.

'She became involved with a man we know as "Nathan". During the course of the relationship, I can only put it like this - she simply lost all common sense and integrity, she became completely involved with him.

'He and his friend promised her work in the fashion industry, telling her they were running a fashion magazine.

'She accepts that she knew it was criminal from the beginning. She became involved through her relationship with an older man and naivety.'

Fulcher pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and was sentenced to 10 months in jail suspended for two years, and told to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.

She was also ordered to pay £400 towards the costs of the case.
