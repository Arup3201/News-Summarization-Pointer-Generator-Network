A benefits cheat who swindled £21,000 of taxpayers' money posted pictures of herself clutching wads of £20 notes on Facebook - before saying she didn't understand why people were angry about her crime.

Mum-of-three Linzy Greaves, from Bolsover, Derbyshire, narrowly avoided jail after falsely claiming the money for three years when she failed to declare her children had been taken into care.

The 25-year-old even gloated about her wealth by posting photos of herself on Facebook clutching a bundle of cash - while giving the middle finger to the camera.

Linzy Greaves, 25, from Bolsover, Derbyshire, who swindled £21,000 in benefits, posted a photo of herself on Facebook posing with wads of £20 notes

But the brazen benefits cheat said she did not understand why people were angry - and said she was not as bad as 'murderers and paedophiles'.

When she was approached by the Derbyshire Telegraph, she said: 'I don't understand why people are angry.

'There are worse folk out there - murderers and paedophiles. I don't mind if people are having a go - it doesn't bother me.'

The defendant was also asked if she was 
ashamed of her actions to which she initially replied 'no' - before 
quickly adding: 'I am. Nobody should do it.'

After being convicted, the mother-of-three said: 'I don't understand why people are angry'

Greaves - who also posted pictures online about a new horse she was trying out -  narrowly avoided a jail sentence earlier this month after admitting failing to declare a change in circumstances.

She was given a four-week suspended prison sentence and was ordered to pay legal costs and a victim surcharge totting up to just £180 at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court.

A message posted on Greaves' personal Facebook page last week said she would not repay 'a penny' of the cash she conned out of taxpayers' pockets, adding: 'Someone has to rinse the w**k Government, don't they?'

But Greaves, who is unemployed, claimed that she did not post the message, insisting her account had been hacked.

A joint investigation by Bolsover District Council and the Department for Work and Pensions found Greaves claimed income support, housing benefit and tax credits as a lone parent between April 2010 and April 2013.

In addition to the suspended prison sentence, Greaves was also ordered to comply with a 12-week curfew between 8pm and 7am which will be monitored electronically.

She was sentenced for dishonestly failing to declare a change in circumstances.

The defendant, who falsely claimed the benefits between 2010 and 2013, posted online about a new horse that she was trying out

In response to Greaves' brazen repost, Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be understandably angry at the sight of their hard-earned cash being waved around on Facebook, especially when it's been claimed illegally.

'Benefit fraud and error totalled more than £3bn last year and the Government has to bring that down.

'That cash needs to be used for front-line services and for those who really need support, so those taking it unfairly have to be punished.'
