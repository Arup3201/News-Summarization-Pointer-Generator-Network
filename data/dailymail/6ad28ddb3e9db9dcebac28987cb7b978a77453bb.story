Cybersecurity experts have given a detailed outline to the FBI about the hack attack against Sony Pictures, insisting it was not the work of North Korea but a group of current and former employees who shared a 'mutual hatred' for the company.

While the FBI and Sony have announced they believe Pyongyang carried out the hack - claims that were denied by leader Kim Jong-un - independent security officials have been coming forward for the past week saying most of the evidence points to an inside job.

Silicon Valley security firm Norse, which provides intelligence to companies to prevent their software from being hacked, has been investigating the compromise at Sony and shared their findings with the FBI on Tuesday, according to Gawker.

Norse senior vice president Kurt Stammberger said the hack hinges on a woman he called 'Lena', who he says worked in a 'key technical' position for 10 years but was sent packing in May during a large sweep of lay-offs.

Stammberger would not reveal to Gawker how Norse came to such a conclusion. 

However he said Lena would have remained 'very well placed to know which servers to target' after leaving the company and 'where all the sensitive information in Sony was stored'.

Lena - which may be an alias - then joined forces with other former employees and people in the hacking community to humiliate Sony.

Stammberger said the people who hadn't worked for Sony 'were individuals that were connected with torrenting Sony movies and content online, were targeted by legal and law enforcement arms, and were irritated that basically they were caught'. 

'We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history,' Stammberger told CBS News last week. 

However, consulting firm Taia Global said the results
of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected
hackers suggest they were more likely from Russia than North
Korea. 

'I think the government acted prematurely in announcing
unequivocally that it was North Korea before the investigation
was complete,' said Mark Rasch, a former federal cybercrimes
prosecutor.

An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse has found that it is likely a Sony insider might have helped launch the attack, and that North Korea is not responsible

The FBI maintains that the Sony hack was carried out by Pyongyang over the release of The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un

'There are many theories about who did it and how
they did it. The government has to be pursuing all of them.'

While U.S. officials investigate whether North Korea
enlisted help from outside contractors, the FBI stood by its
previous statement that Pyongyang was the prime author of the
attack against the Sony Corp unit.

'The FBI has concluded the Government of North Korea is
responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network
of Sony Pictures Entertainment,' the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said in a statement to Reuters.

North Korea has denied that it was behind the Sony attack
and has vowed to hit back against any U.S. retaliation.

The people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said
on Internet postings that they were incensed by the Sony
Pictures film 'The Interview,' a comedy about a fictional
assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Because of the hackers' threats, major U.S. cinema chains
refused to show the film. Last week, Sony struck deals with some
320 independent theaters to distribute 'The Interview' and also
made the film available online.  

The hackers released the email caches of Sony executives, including Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal and its CEO Michael Lynton

The FBI said its determination that North Korea was behind
the hack was based on information from a variety of sources,
including intelligence sources, the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, foreign partners and the private sector.

'There is no credible information to indicate that any other
individual is responsible for this cyber incident,' the agency
said.

Kevin Mandia, whose security firm was hired by Sony to
investigate the attack, said the only way to know who the
culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected
machines back to the hackers' machines. Only the government and
Internet service providers have that kind of visibility, he
added.

'I don't have the data that they have to come up with that
conclusion,' Mandia, chief operating officer of FireEye Inc, said.

'Every attack loops through numerous machines,' he said.
'You have to peel that onion all the way back. It isn't an easy
thing to do.'

Mandia, who has supervised investigations into some of the
world's biggest cyberattacks, said the Sony case was
unprecedented.

'Nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely
destroy all your data, or try to anyway, and that's just
something that no one else has seen,' he said.
