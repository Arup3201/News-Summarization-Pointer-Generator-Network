Jose Mourinho hailed his team for their 'flair' and 'beauty' after watching them destroy Schalke 5-0 but admits it cannot compare to the last Chelsea team he built until they win trophies.

After securing a place in the last 16 of the Champions League as Group G winners, the Chelsea manager called the display 'perfect' and sympathised with Roberto di Matteo for being on the wrong end of it.

Mourinho said: 'I think it was a very impressive performance. The team were always in control, playing very well, top quality football, very compact, no mistakes. This was very complete for 90 minutes.

'Everything was under control and the result was the consequence of one team playing a fantastic match.

'This was the whole 90 minutes. The team were so solid. If anything, in the first half, we could have scored more goals.

'In this moment, we are very confident. We go step by step with this mentality. The players are very serious.

'Everything they do with big focus and ambition, but at the same time with this component, which is quite something new in Chelsea football: this happiness, this flair, this beauty.

'The way they are doing things, we are very happy. We are having good results and playing really, really well at this moment.'

Mourinho declared his happiness at his side's performance after the match as they qualified for the last 16

It was hard for Di Matteo against his former club and he stormed straight down the tunnel at the final whistle.

'The best comfort they can have is that they lost to the best team,' said Mourinho. 'A team who gave them no chances. From the first minute, Chelsea were so strong.

'When you lose a match against a team who put in a perfect performance, you have to move on. Accept the opponent was better. It was not their fault.

'They must be very sad with this result, but my experience tells me that when we lose against a team who is much better than us, you have to accept it. They have to accept we were too strong for them.'

The Chelsea boss hoped it might be a display to end the theories that he is a manager who can only succeed with defensive strategies.

He added: 'Sometimes people who don't understand a lot about football try to put a stamp on a manager: this manager is this, this manager is that. The good ones adapt to reality.

'In this moment, this team is completely different to my team in 2004-08. Completely different. Different players. Different profile. So we play a different football.

'As I was saying, this team, to be so good or better than other Chelsea teams, this team needs to win. At this moment: zero titles.

'We have to transform the quality of our game into results, which we are getting now. But we have to try and win things so this team goes down in Chelsea's history as a brilliant team who won something.'
