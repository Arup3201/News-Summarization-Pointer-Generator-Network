A terminally girl was left heartbroken after thieves stole Christmas decorations which her mother put up early to lift her spirits ahead of a potentially life-saving operation.

Linzy Smith, five, suffers from a rare bone marrow disease and will spend December 25 in a Houston hospital as she begins radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments.

Her mother Jessica decided to decorate their home in Phoenix, Arizona before Thanksgiving to give her daughter a chance to delight in the twinkly lights, lit-up Santa with reindeer and three Christmas trees.

Christmas spirit: Linzy Smith, five, suffers from a rare bone marrow disease, was left devastated after thieves stole her Christmas decorations in Phoenix, Arizona

However a few days later, the family discovered that thieves had taken Santa and the reindeers and tried to rip the lights from their roof, breaking all that was left behind.

But thanks to some kind-hearted police officers, Christmas wasn't cancelled as they bought the family new decorations after responding to the 911 call.

When officers Jacob Lewis and David Head saw Linzy's sadness at her ruined decorations, they decided to take action - replacing her damaged snowflake lights with stars.

Officer Lewis told ksn.com: 'We are not just police officers. We are 
fathers and have children of our own and want to help the community. I am expecting my fifth child.'

The officers said that they just wanted to make Christmas special for the little girl who also suffers from autism and dwarfism.

Along with her two-year-old brother Skylar, the replaced decorations left the little girl brimming with excitement. She ran around the family's yard yelling: 'Santa is coming!'

Donations can be made to Linzy's medical treatment at Wells Fargo, account number 1064675190.
