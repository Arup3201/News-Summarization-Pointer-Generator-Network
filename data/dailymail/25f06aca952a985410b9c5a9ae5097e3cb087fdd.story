Mohammed Javid, 28, was jailed for two years after masterminding a series of insurance scams

A law graduate who masterminded a series of ‘cash for crash’ insurance scams was jailed for two years today.

Mohammed Javid, 28, claimed £80,000 in a number of ‘highly significant frauds’ including faked car accidents, burst water pipes and false benefit claims.

The father-of-one even claimed to be renting a house he owned back to himself, and that a fictitious passenger had sustained injuries from one of the crashes.

Sentencing at Bristol Crown Court, Recorder Waddington said his crimes were committed out of pure greed.

He said: ‘You spent a great deal of time and effort trying to extract money from the state and from various insurance companies in a number of different ways.

‘I am only able to conclude these offences were committed more out of greed on your part than what can be said to be necessity.

‘You are a person who is not destitute and you have got yourself into trouble you are now in by engaging in this course of conduct.

‘There is only one option on the fact and that is a prison sentence.’

The court heard that Javid, from Blackburn, Lancashire, used a number of false names to claim money from insurance companies and the Department of Work and Pensions.

Javid staged three car accidents and claimed a total of more than £40,000 from insurers - although he had only received £4,200 before charges were brought.

In one case in March 2011, Javid, along with brother-in-law and co-defendant Shabeer Ahmad, 30, created a crash between a Vauxhall Astra and a Toyota Celica and claimed £2,500 for the written-off car, of which only £1,500 was awarded.

In November 2010 Javid claimed more than £18,000 for the fictional hire of a Mercedes, car repairs and injuries to a passenger who did not exist.

As evidence of his claim Javid submitted fictitious invoices and told insurers his passenger, who was in fact nowhere near the scene of the accident, had sustained serious injuries which needed compensation.

He was awarded £2,300 for the injuries but insurers refused to pay for the rest.

Stephen Dent, prosecuting, told the court: ‘This is a case which involves some highly significant frauds in a variety of ways.

‘The
defendant claimed the other vehicle had driven into him, but on 
questioning the other driver said it had in fact been the other way 
around.

‘He also made a claim for the damages, vehicle storage costs and personal injury for a passenger.

‘He submitted fictitious invoices for a storage company, the number of which was his own telephone number.

‘The
other driver was asked about a passenger in the car and he said there 
had been no one else in the car with Mr Javid at the time of the 
accident.

At Bristol Crown Court Recorder Waddington said Mohammed Javid's crimes were committed out of pure greed

‘The potential passenger was contacted and he confirmed he had been nowhere near the car at the time.’

In the final crash Javid pulled a female driver over to the side of the road and accused her of driving into him and causing a bump on his Vauxhall Astra van.

But the driver disputed the claim and on investigation it was found that the bump had been on the van when Javid had bought it.

Javid, who ran a businesses in the motor trade, also used a false name to submit a claim for £19,521, from his household insurers for water damage to a property he owned.

He then made a further claim, using the name Mr Patel, for rent of £600 a month while the home was being repaired.

Mr Dent said: ‘He had rented out his own house to himself and claimed the cost back from the insurance company.’

The court heard how Javid and his wife, Sabina Coldrink, 27, a third defendant in the case, applied for benefits from the state.

Javid asked for housing benefits on a property he claimed he lived in, but had in fact rented to someone else, and that he was unfit to work because he suffered from epilepsy.

As a result he received regular mortgage payments from the DWP and was awarded £19,000 in Disability Living Allowance.

Javid admitted six charges of false representation and one of handling stolen goods.

David Tenkin, defending, said his client had genuine remorse for his actions and fully admitted the claims were fraudulent.

He said: ‘There is genuine remorse. He fully admits all of the matters in respect of his guilty pleas.

‘He doesn’t wish to minimalise his role and he accepts all of them.

‘At the time he asserts he was in financial difficulties and he had responsibility for a large number of family members.’

Mr Temkin said Javid’s father, mother and brother were in court to support him.

‘They are a well respected family and they feel an enormous sense of shame.’

Mr Tenkin added that the crimes were not that of an organised, planned criminal, but that there was instead ‘a lack of sophistication’.

Javid, who sat in the dock with Ahmad, was ordered to pay £500 prosecution costs. He remained emotionless as his sentence was passed.

Ahmad, a former insurance firm worker of Hambrook, Bristol, leaded guilty to one count of fraud by false representation totalling £1,500.

He was handed a community sentence for a year, with 150 hours unpaid work.

Coldrink, also of Blackburn, is due to appear at Bristol Crown Court next month to enter pleas on charges of benefit fraud.
