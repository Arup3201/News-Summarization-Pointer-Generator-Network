Jailed jobless father-of-17 Mick Philpott was 'earning' the equivalent of a £100,000 salary in benefits and wages from his wife and live-in lover, it emerged today.

The violent drug user forced wife Mairead and mistress Lisa Willis to pay all their money from cleaning jobs and child tax credits into his bank account while he lounged on the settee watching TV.

But even that wasn't enough for the former soldier, who hatched a plan to frame Miss Willis for the fire which killed six of this children in an appalling attempt to secure a larger council house.

Plot: Over the past eight weeks, Nottingham Crown Court has heard how the house was set on fire last May as part of a plan to frame Mick Philpott's former live-in lover Lisa Willis

Details of his finances emerged as 
Philpott, 56, Mairead, 32, and their friend Paul Mosley, 46, were handed
lengthy jail prison sentences after each were found guilty of six 
counts of manslaughter.

Judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Philpott he 'did not even allow' his wife or lover 'their own door key'.

During
the trial, Nottingham Crown Court heard Philpott had lost £1,000 a 
month when Miss Willis moved out of the family home in Allenton, Derby, 
with her five children.

He
had been receiving a total of £8,023.60 a year in child benefit, while
Mairead and Miss Willis were given £20,560 and £17,870 a year 
respectively, it was reported by The Times.

The two women had cleaning jobs which brought in an extra £14,000.

Philpott, who has not worked since 2004, also received an estimated £150 a week to cover the rent on their three-bedroom house, bringing in a further £7,800 a year to take the total to around £67,000.

Child benefit

Philpott: £20.30 a week for eldest son, £13.40 for the other ten. Yearly total: £8,023.60p

Working tax credits

Mairead: Up to £20,560 a year for her six children

Lisa Willis: Up to £17,870 for her five children

Estimated earnings from their cleaning jobs: £14,000

Yearly total: £38,430

Housing benefit

Philpott: £150 a week

Yearly total: £7,800

ESTIMATED GRAND TOTAL: £68,000

This is the approximate take-home pay of someone earning £100,000

As Working Tax Credits and Child Benefits were paid tax-free, his 'take-home pay' could have been similar to a man earning around £100,000 a year, putting him in the top two per cent of earners.

Mairead's sisters Jennifer and Bernadette told how they frequently tried to rescue her and the children from Philpott's clutches after the household starting imploding when Miss Willis left.

They explained how Mairead attempted suicide in the months before the fire.

Jennifer Lobban told Panorama: 'We would try and get round there when he was doing the school run because we knew that he wouldn’t be in the house.

'We told her that we could go to the school, we could go now; go take the kids from school. We would get her out, but she just wouldn’t leave.'

Philpott once allowed the eldest child, Duwayne, 13, to have a sleepover at Bernadette’s house.

Bernadette said the little boy was in a terrible state, adding: 'Mick said he hadn’t eaten for a week and I took him and my little boy out for a pizza. I had never seen a child eat so fast in my life.’

Liar: Mick (right) and Mairead Philpott appear to cry during a news conference at Derby Conference Centre following a fire at their home which claimed the lives of six of his children

Over the past eight weeks, Nottingham Crown Court has heard how they set fire to their house last May as part of a plan to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Miss Willis.

She had walked out of the shared three-bedroom semi in Allenton, Derby, with her five children and the thousands of pounds in benefits they were worth to Philpott.

The fire was also set in an attempt to get a bigger council house, a demand Philpott had infamously made six years earlier on the Jeremy Kyle Show.

But the plan went tragically wrong, with the petrol-fuelled blaze burning out of control.
