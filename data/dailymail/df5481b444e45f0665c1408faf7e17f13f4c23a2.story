Roger Federer survived a scare to reach the quarter-finals of his home-town tournament in Basle, while 17-year-old Borna Coric set up a clash with Rafael Nadal.

Federer has not failed to reach the final of the Swiss Indoors since 2003, but he had to fight back from a set down to see off Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

In the last eight, the 33-year-old will play fifth seed Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated Vasek Pospisil 6-2, 6-2.

Coric is at the forefront of an exciting new generation in men's tennis and he followed up his upset of Ernests Gulbis in round one by seeing off Andrey Golubev 6-4, 6-4.

Nadal was the Croatian teenager's hero growing up and Coric said on the ATP website: 'I think it's going to be a great match.

'He's an unbelievable tennis player. It's a privilege to play against him. I hope I can play the best I can and we'll see what happens.'

The other quarter-final will be between eighth seed Ivo Karlovic and Germany's Benjamin Becker.

Karlovic battled to a 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-3 win over Kenny De Schepper, while Becker was leading 4-0 in the decider against Mikhail Kukushkin when the Kazakh retired.
