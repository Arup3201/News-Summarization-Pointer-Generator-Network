Fabrice Muamba's father and fiancée have today thanked millions across the world for the support they believe has helped save his life.

From his London hospital bed in intensive care the stricken footballer, whose heart stopped for 78 minutes last Saturday, has also asked his loved ones to tell people to keep thinking and praying for him.

Speaking for the first time together, his dad Marcel Muamba and wife-to-be Shauna Magunda expressed their 'enormous gratitude' to the Bolton and Tottenham medical teams for their quick reaction during last weekend's FA Cup quarter final.

Medics worked on the Bolton Wanderers 
footballer for almost an hour and a half to save him 
after he suffered a cardiac arrest - shocking his heart 15 times before 
it restarted.

Ever since he was rushed to hospital 
his family, including Shauna, 27, and his parents Marcel and Gertrude, 
have all been maintaining a constant vigil.

Speaking this lunchtime the pair 
praised the 'fantastic team' still caring for him at the London Chest 
Hospital, warning he is not out of danger yet.

'Even though Fabrice has made great 
progress over the last couple of days, he is still in intensive care, 
and still has a long period of recovery ahead. He has asked that you 
please keep him in your prayers,' they said in statement.

Thanking the public and media for 
respecting their privacy in the past week, they added: 'We would like to thank God for answering our prayers.

'Thank you to everyone for the love, prayers and support over the past few days.

'In particular we owe an enormous gratitude to the Bolton and Spurs medical teams for their quick reaction on Saturday, and the fantastic team here at The London Chest Hospital.

'We have been overwhelmed by all the kind messages we have received. The support we have had from the fans not just from Bolton but football supporters around the world has given us so much strength. 

'We have been particularly touched by the support from the football community globally.'

Bolton are set to play their first game since the incident on Saturday, against rivals Blackburn Rovers.

It was Muamba's father who revealed the 
bewildered footballer asked 'did we lose?' when he came round in his bed
after being put in an artificially induced coma.

When
he was told the match had been abandoned with the scores at 1-1, the 
footballer demanded to know why. His father Marcel said: 'Because of 
you'.

Doctors cannot yet say whether he would be able to play professional football again and are reluctant to predict a timetable for his recovery, which remains in the early stages.

The footballer has been visited by a host of top professionals including Chelsea's Ashley Cole, Tottenham forward Jermain Defoe and Bolton teammate Kevin Davies.

Players and teams across the world have also shown their support by wearing special t-shirts and having a minute's applause before games.

Consultant cardiologist Andrew Deaner,
who left his seat in the crowd and went on to the pitch to help the 
23-year-old, has described the recovery made so far as 'miraculous.'

The midfielder has been talking and 
even joking, while Spurs medic Jonathan Tobin said the player had told 
him on Tuesday that he was 'fine'.

Mr Deaner said he had had tears in his eyes at witnessing that sign of the player’s sense of humour returning so soon.

He recalled how he had been watching the match with his brother when he saw Muamba collapse and doctors rush to his side.

Turning to his brother, he said: 'They’re doing CPR. I should go and help.'

His brother agreed, he said, and so the father of three sprang into action.

'Something sort of told me I should go down,' he said. 'The adrenaline starts pumping when you see a cardiac arrest.'

Consultant cardiologist Dr Sam Mohiddin, who has been caring for Muamba at the hospital, said it was 'extraordinary' for someone whose heart has stopped beating for as long as the player’s did to make the kind of progress he has made.

'Fabrice has continued to demonstrate positive signs of recovery and he has not only exceeded our expectations but also our hopes in the way he’s recovered,' he said.

'But this remains very early in what could be a lengthy recovery period.'
