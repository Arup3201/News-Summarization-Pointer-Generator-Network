Back on home soil, there are few people the Duchess of Cornwall has to curtsey to.

Yet it seems being on the receiving end of the greeting so many times has left her in no doubt about how to execute it with style.

Camilla displayed perfect poise and grace as she gave a respectful curtsey to the Queen of Jordan at the Hummar Palace yesterday.

Lookalike: Camilla Duchess of Cornwall appears to curtsy to Kate Middleton. In fact the mark of respect is to Queen Rania of Jordan who was welcoming the Duchess and Prince Charles on a visit to the Royal Palace in Amman

The duchess and Prince Charles met 
glamorous Queen Rania Al-Abdullah as they began a ten-day tour of the 
Middle East, which will also take in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman.

Mother-of-four Queen Rania, who has 
been ranked the most beautiful consort in the world by Harper’s Bazaar 
magazine, chatted with Camilla about the cold British weather.

Prince Charles, meanwhile, was busy 
regaling King Abdullah II about the time he rode a camel on a visit to 
the region nine years ago – and came a cropper.

But later, the prince got a reassuring
taste of home as he was shown a clip of a new 3D feature film about 
none other than Postman Pat, who is popular with children in Jordan.

Mark of respect: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were being officially welcomed to Jordan by the King and Queen of Jordan today on the first full day of their Middle East trip

He was even presented with an 
eight-inch high model of himself posing alongside Postman Pat and his 
cat Jess – which appeared to tickle him enormously.

With her tumbling brunette curls, slim 
frame and sculpted cheekbones, Queen Rania bears an uncanny resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge, although the lack of a baby bump is an obvious giveaway.  

The Duchess of Cornwall decided to get the ball 
rolling by cheerfully chatting to Queen Rania about the 
snow storm wreaking havoc at home.

The elegant Queen, 42, seemed pleased with Camilla’s conversation opener and replied: 'So it's a good time to be away then?'

On meeting at the Hummar Palace 
Camilla curtseyed deeply and respectfully to her, as required by rank. 
Camilla, of course, is only a Duchess still while Rania is Queen.

After a formal 'honour guard' welcome at the palace, the couple went their separate ways.

Charles donned a pair of white slippers 
on a visit to the King Hussein Mosque and was later given a tour of an 
award-winning digital production company.

Meanwhile the Duchess of Cornwall put on a virtual crown as she took part in a 
storytelling session for deaf children during a visit to a museum.

As she listened to the story, read in
English by a storyteller from the British Council, the Duchess joined 
the children in forming the words of the story in sign language - 
including miming the donning of a crown.

The Duchess, who according to 
Clarence House will be called Princess Consort when Charles is King, was
visiting a children's museum founded by Queen Rania in the capital 
Amman.

Storyteller Lee Henson, the teaching centre manager with the British Council, said: "She was fantastic. She did all the signs."

The Duchess also painted a pebble 
with a group of children and planted a kumquat tree. 'Oh my embarrassing
pebble,' she said as it was placed by the tree. 'Don't look at my 
pebble. It's not my best piece of art.'

Then it was off to a local girls' school with Queen Rania driving herself in a customised black £150,000 Mercedes G Wagon.

According to sources, Rania had the car custom-made for her. Camilla, who arrived a few minutes later, curtseyed again.

The two women first watched a group 
of girls playing basketball before being formally welcomed to the 
establishment by a group of pupils dancing and singing a welcome dance 
called an Al Dabka.

The two royal ladies were then escorted into several classrooms including one where the girls were using the internet.

The Duchess admitted to being 'unfamiliar' with Facebook and pulled a few faces.

After taking part in a group 
discussion about diversity, the Duchess was presented with paper flowers
by two teenage schoolgirls who kissed her on both cheeks -as is local 
custom.

Camilla also visited a classroom where girls were being taught about healthy eating. 'No junk food then?' she said.

She presented the school with some 
children's books to be used by a British charity called Katie's Readers 
which uses native English speakers to teach young Jordanian children 
English.

Gift: Camilla was presented with a bracelet made from recycled materials during a visit to Mahis Secondary School for Girls

They included The Tiger Who Came To 
Tea, A Bear Called Paddington, The Gruffalo, Prince Charles's book The 
Old Man of Lochnagar and the Buckingham Palace children's book, Does The
Queen Wear Her Crown In Bed?

Before leaving she took part in a 
game involving bouncing a ball on the ground and catching it. She was 
not exactly a natural - she managed to miss the catch a couple of times.

For Prince Charles, there was a taste of home and a meeting with none other than Britain’s own Postman Pat.

The Prince beamed with amusement as 
he was shown the opening scene of a 3D feature film about Greendale’s 
favourite resident and chatted to staff at an animation studio bringing 
the TV series to the big screen.

He was even presented with a model of
himself, posing characteristically with one hand in his jacket pocket, 
alongside Pat and his faithful cat Jess.

The Jordanian firm Rubicon is making 
the film, due for release at the end of this year, in partnership with 
the Hollywood studio Dreamworks.

Co-ordination: Camilla appeared to struggle to get the hang of the game but appeared happy to take part

The Prince watched with fascination 
as Mahmoud Hindawi, 30, used an electronic pen to draw and paint a 
picture of Pat as part of the pre-production process before the images 
are converted into 3D graphics.

Admiring the artist’s skill, the 
Prince said: 'It’s brilliant. Have you been doing this since you were 
quite small? Is it hereditary?”

Mr Hindawi told him his father was an architect and that he had done a masters degree in Newport, south Wales.

One of the staff told the Prince he 
had seen the Prince’s own paintings and that they were 'amazing', to 
which Charles replied: 'I can’t do this though.'

Animator Mona Zalloum gave the Prince
a sneak preview of the film on her computer screen after finishing a 
scene in which Postman Pat sings a song.

After being shown how the images are animated, the Prince said: 'The complexity is incredible isn’t it?'

Mona said: 'In the film, Postman Pat 
goes to a contest like Britain’s Got Talent and sings because he wants 
to win money to take his wife to Italy. He surprises everyone with his 
singing.'

Surprisingly, Postman Pat is popular with children in Jordan, where it has been shown on TV for decades.

Mona said: 'We all used to watch it as kids. It’s exciting for us to be working on turning it into a movie.'

At the beginning of his tour of the 
facility in Amman the Prince put on 3D glasses and used a 3D mouse to 
put out a fire using an extinguisher as he was shown technology which is
used to train people in the workplace in a safe but realistic way.

He was told it enabled people to work with electricity in a safe environment and he said: 'That suits me.'

He also had a go at wiring a plug, 
but deliberately got it wrong after being told he would feel a slight 
shock through the mouse if he connected the wrong wire.

Asked if he felt the shock, he said: 'Yes I did, I don’t think I would make a very good electrician.'

At the end of the tour the Prince was
shown the opening scene of the Postman Pat film, again putting on 3D 
glasses to see a train pulling in to Greendale Station before the camera
flies across lush fields with children playing in them and arrives at 
Pat’s front door, where Jess is sitting on the doorstep wearing the 
postman’s cap.

Randa Ayoubi, the chief executive of 
Rubicon, told Charles: 'We are doing this for children all over the 
world. He is a very authentic character and this is Pat being taken 
outside the UK and into the world.'

The Prince then posed for photograph 
with the entire staff, when he was presented with the eight-inch high 
model of himself, towering above Pat and Jess.
