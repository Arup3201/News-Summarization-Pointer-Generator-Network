Headmistress Alice Phillips said the rise of social media meant every action taken by a parent is now subject to 'global scrutiny' 

Facebook and Twitter are creating a generation of parents afraid to discipline their teenage children in case they are then embarrassed on social media, a leading headmistress warned yesterday.

Teenagers are increasingly refusing to back down in rows with mothers and fathers as friends egg them on via social networking sites, according to Alice Phillips, president of the Girls' Schools Association.

Parents are becoming 'less bold and intuitive' when disciplining adolescents amid fears that family disputes will be broadcast to hundreds of the youngsters' friends online, she warned.

Whereas children might previously have reflected alone in their bedrooms and 'moved on', they were now more likely to 'continue the fight' in cahoots with their online allies.

Mrs Phillips argued in a speech to the GSA annual conference in London that parenting is now more difficult than ever before because of money worries and the pressure of domestic disputes being put under 'global scrutiny'.

Schools should consider giving parents classes to help them 'hold the line' after making decisions that are unpopular with their children, she added.

Her warning comes days after a large Government study of 13-year-olds found they increasingly spend time alone at home instead of being out with friends. A portrait of today's 13-year-olds found that social networking sites were eclipsing personal contact with friends after school and at weekends.

Nearly half of girls – 47 per cent – reported using social networking or instant messaging sites 'throughout the day' and 30 per cent of boys.

Mrs Phillips, of St Catherine's School, a private girls' school near Guildford, Surrey, told the conference of her concern for parents. 'I find myself increasingly wanting to reach out to them as I believe that parenting has never been as difficult as it is today,' she said.

'Why? Because one's instincts are constantly challenged and spontaneous confidence dissolves. Parents are becoming less bold and intuitive in parenting adolescents.

'Today, social media means they are conscious that their every action is the subject of global scrutiny.

'Children, as grumpy as any of us were when given the answer No, retreat in the same way to their bedrooms but instead of reflecting for a while to blaring music, broadcast their parents' apparently unreasonable behaviour to all their Facebook friends, or Twitter followers, whose own parents are apparently also 'completely out of touch'.

'Where once they might have taken time out to come to their senses, apologise and 'move on', now they are more likely to continue the fight.'

Children are choosing to share their anger with friends online instead of sulking in their bedrooms, which means that parents are constantly left questioning their decisions (stock image) 

Mrs Phillips also said she was constantly forced to use the phrase 'a mother's place is in the wrong' to reassure parents whose daughters were competing 'for the place of alpha females'.

'Nonetheless, it takes courage and a long time these days to stay out there 'in the wrong' until your teen gradually realises that you are in fact dependable, wise and 'in the right',' she said.

Some parents 'even start to believe all that their distressed children say' and anxious mothers and fathers may then 'turn on' teachers instead of calling on them for help or support.

Schools should consider offering 'structured and reassuring courses' on what parents should expect at each stage of their child's development.

'Can we supplement the routine formula of parents' evenings which have the aura of speed dating – without the excitement – with something more informal that facilitates dialogue between parents who may often feel isolated in making big decisions or holding the unpopular line?'

Mrs Phillips said parents faced further worries over university fees and homes and jobs for their children. 'Is it any surprise that parents who are anxious to support their children feel they are not as empowered as once they were?'
