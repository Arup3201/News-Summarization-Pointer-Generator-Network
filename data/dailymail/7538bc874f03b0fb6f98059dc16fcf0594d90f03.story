The parents of the teen who killed four people while driving drunk has paid undisclosed sums to three of his victims but has still not settled with the fourth victim.

Ethan Couch, the teen whose lawyer argued that he had 'affluenza' after his wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility, is currently in state custody and is expected to receive alcohol and drug rehab.

Youth pastor Brian Jennings and Hollie Boyles had pulled over separately at the side of a Burleson, Texas road on June 15 to help Breanna Mitchell who had a tire blowout.

Turning back time: Ethan Couch, pictured at a February hearing, was sentenced to 10 years' probation in a drunken-driving crash that killed four people and his wealthy relatives have reached settlements with two families of victims

Blaming the parents: Tonya Couch, left, and Fred Couch, Ethan's parents, previously offered to pay to have him receive treatment at a California rehab facility that costs $450,000-per-year

Couch was speeding at around 70 miles per hour and he hit the gathered group- killing those three people and Mrs Boyle's daughter Shelby who was with her at the time.

He also seriously injured two of his friends who were sitting in the back of the flatbed truck that he was driving at the time of the crash.

So far, The Dallas Morning News reports that Couch's relatives have reached undisclosed settlements with the Mitchell and Boyles family but have not yet agreed on a deal with Jennings' family.

There have been no reports of a deal with his injured friends' families, including that of Sergio Lemuus who was left paralyzed after the accident.

It
 was revealed during the trial that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - 
three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in
 their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium 
when he started the chain reaction of crashes.

The 16-year-old's lawyer Reagan Wynn and prosecutor Richard Alpert would not identify the facility where Couch will go or where it is located.

Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup. Their relatives have settled with the Couches

Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash and Jennings relatives have not yet reached a settlement with Couch's parents

The teen's family previously had offered 
to pay for Couch to go to a $450,000-a-year rehabilitation center near 
Newport Beach, California.

There is no minimum amount of time Couch must spend in the facility before his release, prosecutor Riley Shaw said.

The judge warned that he could face prison time if he runs away from the facility or violates any other terms of his probation.

Wynn ripped the media and the public's focus on ‘affluenza’ and said that his client was misunderstood.

He said reporting of the Couch case had ‘so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don't think the truth will ever be able to come out now.’

‘It was ridiculous to think that we walked into court and said, 'Oh, this is a rich white kid,' and she decided to probate him,’ he said.

Scene: The accident happened on the night of June 15, 2013 on this road in Burleson, Texas

No jail: Ethan pictured here in December, avoided jail for killing four and injuring two more after his attorney argued that he was coddled by his parents so much that he didn't understand the difference between right and wrong

But Alpert accused Wynn of hypocrisy, pointing out that a defense witness made the comment in the first place.

‘His witnesses don't say things by accident,’ Alpert said. ‘So they thought maybe that would help — that's my interpretation — and it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say.’

Asking Judge Jean Boyd in February to give Couch jail time for intoxication assault was a last-ditch effort by prosecutors, who have said they have almost no way to appeal the judge's sentence in the case.

Alpert said he hoped the Couch case would lead the Texas Legislature to allow juries to sentence some juvenile defendants.

The case has already spurred calls for potential changes. Texas Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, who serves as president of the Senate, has asked for a study of sentencing guidelines in intoxication manslaughter cases.
