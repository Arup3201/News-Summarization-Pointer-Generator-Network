Talking satnavs and taking your eyes off the road to peer at a small screen could soon be a thing of the past - after scientists developed a portable device that beams directions onto the inside of a car windscreen.

Garmin has created a portable heads-up display (HUD) that sits on a car's dashboard and projects turn-by-turn directions on a transparent film attached to the windscreen.

The directions are sent to the HUD over Bluetooth from a smartphone running the Garmin StreetPilot or NAVIGON satellite navigation apps.

Satnav firm Garmin has created a portable device, pictured, that sits on a car's dashboard and can project turn-by-turn directions onto the windscreen. The directions are sent to the heads-up display using a smartphone app and projected onto a transparent film attached to the screen

The HUD automatically adjusts the brightness level of the directions based on the light conditions at the time. This makes sure the projections are clearly visible in direct sunlight or at night, pictured

The Garmin HUD can connect to any Bluetooth-enabled device including smartphones and tablets.

The driver then plots their route on the phone or tablet using either the Garmin StreetPilot or NAVIGON satellite navigation apps. 

Turn-by-turn directions are sent wirelessly to the HUD.

These directions are then beamed from the projector onto a transparent plastic film stuck to the inside of the windscreen.

Alternatively, the directions can be shown on a reflector lens attached directly to the HUD.

Garmin's HUD shows turning arrows, 
the distance to the next turn, the current driving speed as well as the 
estimated time of arrival.

It even lets drivers know 
what lane to be in, warns of potential traffic delays and shows the location of nearby speed cameras.

Spoken turn-by-turn directions can also be enabled and are played out either through the smartphone's speakers, or via Bluetooth through the car's stereo. 

If music is being streamed to the car stereo from the smartphone at the same time the HUD will automatically 
fade it out for the turn-by-turn voice prompts.

The HUD will also continue to display directions if the driver takes a call on a hands-free kit. 

If drivers don't want to beam the directions onto the plastic film they can instead project them through a reflector lens that connects directly to the HUD.

The HUD automatically adjusts the brightness level when using the film, or the lens, to make sure projections can be seen clearly in direct sunlight or at night.

'HUD redefines the navigation experience by allowing drivers to find 
their way without taking their eyes off the road,' said Dan Bartel, 
Garmin vice president of worldwide sales.

'Head-up displays currently 
have their place in select high-end cars, but HUD makes this technology 
available as an aftermarket accessory for any vehicle, at an affordable 
price.'

Garmin's latest device gets its directions from the Garmin StreetPilot and NAVIGON apps that are available on iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 handsets.

The Garmin HUD will go on sale in September and cost £139.

Commenting on the device, RAC's technical director David Bizley told MailOnline: 'There has been a good deal of interest in this kind of technology and we need to look more closely at how motorists would use it on a day-to-day basis.

'However, it is certainly true that current satnav screens can be a distraction and if poorly positioned can both obscure vision and cause drivers to take their eyes off the road.

'We know that head-up displays are commonly used for military aircraft because they enable the pilot to continue to look ahead without having to divert their gaze down to look at numbers and dials.

'In principle, therefore, a head-up display for satnav is a good idea – provided it is located in a position that allows the driver an unhindered view of the road ahead and operates in a way that does not distract the driver.'

A recent study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the U.S. found that hands-free kits - such as Garmin's HUD - can cause an 'extensive risk' to drivers and pedestrians.

The findings even suggests they may be no safer than using a phone.

The research found that dangerous mental distractions exist even when drivers keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.

As mental workload and distractions increase, reaction times get 
slower and brain function while driving is compromised.

This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians.
