One-time Queens Park Rangers target Alexandre Pato shot back to the top of headlines on Wednesday night after scoring a composed hat-trick against Capivariano for Sao Paulo.

Pato was once widely tipped as one of the game's rising stars and had initially impressed during a five-year spell at Italian giants AC Milan. 

However, a combination of injuries and a dip in form led him to an exit from the San Siro in a cut-price £12.8 million move to Corinthians in 2013.

Pato scored 17 goals in 62 games for Corinthians before being loaned to current club Sao Paulo where he has started to show signs that he might be back to his best. 

Nevertheless, Corinthians do not consider Pato to be in their first-team plans and recently offered him to Premier League side QPR, although no deal materialised before the end of the January transfer window, a decision that the relegation threatened club could come to regret.   

But if Pato can carry on at Sao Paolo with performances like the one against Capivariano, then there should be no shortage of suitors for the 25-year-old Brazilian when the window reopens in the summer.
