Richard Benyon, MP for Newbury and the ex Tory water minister, said he was thankful for the rain last summer as the UK 'dodged a bullet'

Britain was saved from using standpipes thanks to the Jubilee downpours last year, the former Tory water minister has said.

Richard Benyon, MP for Newbury, has said he felt immense relief last year when it started raining just before the Queen's celebrations began because we were just a few months from 'humiliation as a country'.

The Environment Agency had told him during the summer that there was just a three per cent chance of enough rain falling to refill the nation's reservoirs.

In an interview with The Observer, he said: 'I immediately thought of the jubilee and the Olympics, 
thinking: 'How are we going to do this?

'Thames Water assured me there 
would be enough water for the Olympic Village, and all the activities 
and the hotels, but it would be at a price.

'London would have looked 
awful: brown parks, prematurely leafless trees; there could have been 
very serious water restrictions in parts of the south-east, such as 
Sussex.

'We knew 
we were facing a serious problem. And then it rained and we dodged a 
bullet. That was extraordinary.'

The deluge started just before the Queen's Jubilee flotilla celebrations, and continued into winter, only pausing for the Olympics.

Benyon's said his comments were made to stop the short term thinking that has dominated the recent debate over bringing down water bills.

The Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations last year were marked by the largest flotilla seen on the Thames in 350 years as well as torrential rain which lead to the wettest June on record

In total 548 people had to be check for hypothermia after the flotilla finished due to the weather

He said: 'Household bills are obviously important. But for heaven's sake, I really hope we can link the need to keep bills lower with the need for investment and protection of the environment.

'The investment tap can be really quickly turned off if international sovereign wealth funds and pensions funds, who quite like our regulated sector at the moment, think some of the language being used by politicians makes it not the sector in which they want to invest.'

He called for more water meters to be imposed in people's homes, increased investment in new reservoirs and greater connectivity between existing water storage.

He also said there should be a crackdown on the cheap option of companies draining the nation's rivers to meet shortages in supply.

Benyon says before the downpour started he was warned the country was just months away from having to use standpipes in London leading to 'humiliation as a country'

The MP called for more water meters and investment in reservoirs, and said that debates about bringing down water bills could scare off investors

The 1,000 boat flotilla which sailed down the Thames last June was the most spectacular event to be held on the river for 350 years.

However high winds and heavy rain caused some problems, especially among the Royal College of Music Chamber Choir who sang Land of Hope and Glory along with the national anthem while pulling soggy strands of hair from their faces.

In fact the weather was so bad that paramedics checked them over for hypothermia once they were back on dry land. In total 548 people were checked for signs of the condition, brought about by extreme cold.

According to the Met Office, June last year was the wettest since records began in 1910, with 145.3mm of rainfall recorded, more than twice as much as normal.

It was also the second dullest, with just 119.2 hours of sunshine - the record of 115.4 hours was in 1987.
