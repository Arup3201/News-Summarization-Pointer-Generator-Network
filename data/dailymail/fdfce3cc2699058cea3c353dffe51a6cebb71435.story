All pupils should study for GCSE-style qualifications in good manners, kindness and self-control says Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College

All pupils should study for GCSE-style qualifications in good manners, kindness and self-control, says a leading headmaster.

Schools should devote as much attention to developing children’s ‘character’ as preparing them for exams, according to Dr Anthony Seldon.

In a speech next week, Dr Seldon, the master of fee-paying Wellington College in Berkshire, will call for pupils to be taught the importance of traditional manners, punctuality, kindness, tidiness, self-control, responsibility, determination, resilience and appreciation.

He will say that so-called ‘character education’ is vital for the smooth running of schools and also helps prepare pupils for university and jobs.

But the Government is failing to do enough to emphasise the importance of it, he claims.

Delivering a lecture at Birmingham University, Dr Seldon, who has championed so-called ‘happiness lessons’ at Wellington, will say: ‘Schools are rightly emphasising exam results and academic attainment.

‘They need also to emphasise the development of good character, which is essential for the smooth running of schools, for future employability, for higher education and for good citizenship.’ A new GCSE-style compulsory qualification should be introduced, called the GCCE - General Certificate of Character Education.

‘All schools must offer this qualification, and all students must take this qualification, which will be as prized by future employers, and even by Higher Education, as highly as GCSE,’ he will say.

Top state and independent schools which paid attention to character development were seeing ‘dramatic’ gains, according to Dr Seldon.

‘It used to be the case that the public schools emphasised the development of character.

Schools should devote as much attention to developing children's 'character' as preparing them for exams, according to Dr Seldon

‘Now the best state schools are leading the way.

‘They are teaching their students character - good manners, self-control, self-reliance, responsibility, punctuality, determination, resilience, appreciation, kindness and tidiness. The impact is dramatic.’ He will add: ‘The government wants to build on a big society.

But they are not doing enough to build capacity amongst young people when they are at school. The emphasis has tilted too far to exam preparation and too far away from developing the child.’ He called on Education Secretary Michael Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw to give character education a ‘higher priority’.

‘They have seen it as an alternative to, and even a threat to, academic attainment,’ he said.

‘If all schools offered the GCCE (General Certificate of Character Education), and all children took it, we would have much better schools in Britain, and they would go on to build a much better society.’
