Lazio will intensify their interest in Ravel Morrison this weekend after the West Ham forward was cleared of all charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother.

The 21-year-old was accused of hitting Reah Mansoor, 19, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, after a night out at a club in his home city of Manchester last July 24.

He was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court later this month but on Thursday the charges were dropped by the prosecution and Morrison, who was not in court, was found not guilty.

Italian side Lazio want to sign West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison on a pre-contract for the summer

And the news allows Lazio to accelerate their move for Morrison on a free transfer at the end of the season.

Sportsmail understands talks over a move for the former Manchester United man are scheduled to take place this weekend.

And if everything goes according to plan for the Serie A club, a pre-contract agreement could be in place by the start of next week.

The Italians have been offered the West Ham midfielder, as reported by Sportsmail, but are aware they cannot buy him now owing to UEFA regulations.

Morrison has played for West Ham and Cardiff and would not be allowed to sign for a club in another country during this window.

Guy Mathieson, prosecuting, told the court the charges had been withdrawn after Morrison's defence team recovered CCTV footage of the first alleged assault outside the One Central nightclub, in Manchester city centre.

It showed that Morrison had not hit his ex, as was alleged, and she had 'slumped' to the floor on her own.

The ex-girlfriend also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off and there was 'reluctance' from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her.

All three charges of assault were withdrawn.

Morrison had also been initially accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex and have her shot during a four-year period of harassment.

But at a hearing last November the harassment charge was also withdrawn by the prosecution and he was found not guilty on those charges.

Morrison is currently back with West Ham after a loan spell with Cardiff.

He was first arrested last August after it was alleged that, during a night out, he assaulted his ex and, after 'bundling' her into his Porsche Panamera car, took her home to her mother's house in Salford.

When they got back to the house, he was alleged to have assaulted Miss Mansoor again, as well as her mother.

But Mr Mathieson said Morrison's lawyers had got the CCTV footage from an office building which captured the alleged first assault.

He said that, in her statement, Miss Mansoor said she remembered her boyfriend standing in front of her and then waking up on the floor with him standing over her.

Mr Mathieson continued: 'When reviewing the CCTV footage, it's clear there's a gap she doesn't remember between those two statements.

'She's seen falling, or slumping to the ground, remaining there for a minute or two before, quite clearly, the defendant and her friend come to her assistance, trying to get her to stand up.

'And it is right, thereafter, the Porsche Panamera, the defendant's car, is seen to come, she's put, bundled or half-carried into the car and she's then taken home.

'It's quite clear from that CCTV footage there's no assault at that stage.

'The Crown have to accept there's a gap in the evidence and the Crown is in the position where they have to reconsider the prospect of a conviction and offer no evidence in respect of count one.'
