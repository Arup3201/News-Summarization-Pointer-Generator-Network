The father of the man suspected of being 'Jihadi John' is accused of being one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants and is currently awaiting trial in the US for his part in the bombing of two US embassies in which 224 people died, MailOnline can reveal.

On trail: Adel Abdel Bari is accused of plotting the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya

Adel Abdel Bari, 54, is now locked up in New York awaiting trial for the bombing of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania after being extradited from Britain along with hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri.

Bari was allowed entry into the UK when he was granted political asylum from his native Egypt in 1993.

Two years later he was sentenced to death in absentia for a 1995 plot to blow up a market in Cairo's bazaar district. In a separate Egyptian trial in 1999 he was also sentenced to life in prison.

Jihadi John — who cruelly beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video released by the terror group Islamic State last week — is believed to be Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, Bari's 23-year-old son, who left the million-dollar home in Maida Vale, London, which he shared with his mother Ragaa and five sisters, to fight with the ruthless group which has run rampage through Syria and Iraq.

Bari showed his barbarism when he posted a grisly picture of himself holding a severed head to his Twitter account.

He captioned it 'Chillin' with my other homie, or what's left of him.'

In another picture, captioned 'Fireworks', he stands in front of dozens of bags of plastic explosives.

Videos posted to YouTube show Bary, who used the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny, show him praising his father in rap.

'Give me the pride and the honor like my father, I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two.

'Imagine then I was only six. Picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick. Like boom bang fine, I’m wishing you were dead. Violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.'

Other lyrics express his disgust with drugs and drink.

Since he went to Syria he has appealed for the videos to be taken down from YouTube as they no longer represent what he allegedly stands for.

In another video, recorded for the London-based Internet broadcaster SB.TV, he raps about the hardship of a family with 'six siblings and a mum to feed.'

'The system cut the benefits, now I'm the one for peace,' Bary adds.

'And now they want to send my family back to Egypt.

'On top of that, the pops is doing life without remand.'

Bary's 54-year-old father is currently being held as federal prisoner number 67496-054 in the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.

His trial is due to start in November.

He was held in custody in Britain for 14 years before his extradition in October 2012.

The older man has a long history of terror involvement, dating back before the birth of his son.

He was imprisoned and tortured in Egypt following the murder of President Anwar Sadat in 1981, according to a sympathetic profile of his wife which appeared in the Guardian last year. 

After years of going in and out of prison in Egypt, during which he managed to gain a degree and become a respected human rights lawyer with ties to Amnesty International, Bari managed to leave the country and in 1991, the year Bary was born, he applied for political asylum in Britain.

His family joined him after it was granted, two years later.

According to the Guardian, he was arrested soon after the August 7, 1998 embassy bombings.

'There was a dawn raid by British police in white contamination suits, brandishing truncheons and breaking down the front door. Ragaa and the children were traumatized.

Chief: Bari was appointed head of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in May 1996 by Current al-Qaeda head Ayman al Zawahiri (pictured), according to his indictment

'A dozen or so men were suddenly in their bedrooms, shouting for her husband, searching the children's clothes, tearing out pages from any books with telephone numbers.

'Adel was led away, and Ragaa, hurriedly putting on her black hijab and abaya, was told to get into a bus with her five children, one of whom was a small baby.'

But British authorities found nothing to tie Bari to the embassy bombings and he was soon released.

He was charged with having unlawful gas canisters but was acquitted at trial, the Guardian said.

He was arrested again when the United States applied for his extradition on the same charges that the British had dismissed and he was then held in Long Lartin and Manchester prisons, at one time going on hunger strike to protest what he considered racist treatment by guards and orders that all phone calls had to be made in English not Arabic.

According to his indictment in the embassy bombing case, current al-Qaeda head Ayman al Zawahiri appointed him head of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in May 1996.

The next year he leased an office in Beethoven Street, just off London's Kilburn Lane.

That office became bin Laden's 'media information office,' the indictment says.

It was also set up to ' to provide a cover for activity in support of al Qaeda’s “military” activities, including the recruitment of military trainees, the disbursement of funds and the procurement of necessary equipment (including satellite telephones) and necessary services.

'In addition, the London office served as a conduit for messages, including reports on military and security matters from various al Qaeda cells, including the Kenyan cell, to al Qaeda’s headquarters.'

Bari 'made efforts to facilitate the delivery of fake travel documents to co-conspirators who were members or associates of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Holland and Albania,' the indictment says.

He is charged with 213 counts of premeditated murder for the Nairobi bombing and 11 more for the attack in Dar es Salaam.

He is also charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and several lesser charges.

He faces life in prison if convicted.

Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan said at the time of his extradition that Bari, Abu Hamsa and a third man, Khaled al Fawwaz 'are men who were at the nerve centers of al Qaeda’s acts of terror, and they caused blood to be shed, lives to be lost, and families to be shattered.

'After years of protracted legal battles, the extradition of these three alleged terrorists to the U.S. is a watershed moment in our nation’s efforts to eradicate terrorism, and it makes good on a promise to the American people to use every available diplomatic, legal, and administrative tool to pursue and prosecute charged terrorists no matter how long it takes,' he added.

The embassy bombings were what first brought Osama bin Laden to the attention of the American public.

A total of 21 people, including bin Laden and Zawahiri, were named in the indictment.

Of those at least nine are now dead and six are already serving life sentences after being convicted.

The others are either awaiting trial or on the run.
