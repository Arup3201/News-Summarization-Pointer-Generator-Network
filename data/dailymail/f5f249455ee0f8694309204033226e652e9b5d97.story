These incredible images capture the moment a paraglider flew into the record books with a 240-mile flight.

Gavin McClurg, 41 sailed at speeds of over 30mph and more than 18,000ft high for seven-and-a-half hours over the largest mountain ranges in the American West.

Mr McClurg took off from Bald Mountain, Idaho, taking in stunning sights as he crossed several mountain ranges including the three boulders, Pioneers and Continental Divide before landing at the edge of Canyon Ferry Lake, just outside of Helena, Montana.

Record-breaker: Gavin Mcclurg (photographed by his wife Jody MacDonald) broke the U.S. Distance Paragliding Foot Launch Record when he glided 240 miles over the mountain ranges of the American West

Stunning: Mcclurg, 41, glided for seven-and-a-half hours from Bald Mountain, Idaho, over the wild landscapes before landing at Canyon Ferry Lake, Montana

Jaw-dropping: The paraglider took in unparalleled views during the glide, which smashed the previous record of 204 miles set last year

The record breaking flight smashed the previous 204-mile record set by Jon Hunt and Nick Greece last year.

Mr McClurg's wife, Jody Macdonald, who is also a paraglider and photographer, joined her husband on his record-breaking flight, as she followed closely behind capturing his feat on camera.

The paraglider, who now holds the U.S. Distance Paragliding Foot Launch Record, said he was thrilled.

He said: 'My wife Jody is a paraglider pilot and she taught me the basics.

'I love paragliding, the adrenaline, the danger, the remoteness, the freedom, the impossibility of it all. Every single time I'm in the air I can't believe what I'm doing.

'And it is by far and away the most intense and gratifying sport I have ever done.

'I fly before I do anything else, and as much as possible. I'm totally addicted, I'm a junky.

'This year, I flew in Mexico and Colombia for all of January, April through June in the European Alps. And we moved to Sun Valley last year because in my opinion it's the best big mountain paragliding site on Earth.

Adrenaline junkie: McClurg said he is addicted to the 'danger, remoteness, freedom' of the sport and travels all over the world to take in the best views

High-flyer: McClurg sailed at speeds of over 30mph and more than 18,000ft high during the glide and said he was thrilled when he finally broke the record

Alien landscape: The paraglider said the area is 'untapped' and the possibilities of over North America are 'literally endless'

'I never specifically set out to break
the record. I'm just always trying to fly as far as I can, taking routes
that are challenging and interesting.

'The
American West is untapped - we have so few pilots in North American 
compared with Europe that the possibilities are literally endless.

'This
was a huge flight, but it's just cracking the surface of what's 
possible. So every time I'm in the air, if the weather presents a good 
day, I try to fly as far as I can.'

The couple have paraglided around the world and have taken stunning photographs over the Himalayas, Morocco, Namibia and Mozambique.

Mr McClurg said he needed to carry food and water during his record-breaking glide.

He said: 'It's very likely on these big flights that you could land an awfully long way from a road, so you've got to be able to get yourself out.

'The day before I broke the record, I'd just achieved my personal best of 192 miles. And just a few days before that was another personal best of 159 miles. So it was a good week.'

Despite his love for the sport, Mr McClurg acknowledges how dangerous it can be.

On a roll: In the week before the glide, McClurg broke his personal best twice before finally smashing the U.S. Distance record

Dedication: McClurg and his wife Jody MacDonald, who is also a paraglider and photographer, have travelled across the world to pursue their love for the sport

He said: 'You're flying in extremely turbulent conditions in this part of the world, especially in the middle of the day when the thermals are cranking. At times I was in climbs that were in excess of 8 meters per second. Sun Valley is known as one of the most demanding places to fly that there is.

'This particular flight saw the strongest conditions I'd ever flown in - windy and incredibly strong thermals.

'So I had to focus really hard, for a long time, but it seemed I was just in the right head space. Maybe I was "in the zone" as they say. At one point though I nearly landed at 319km into the flight - the exact distance I'd gone the day before.

'When I knew I'd broken the record I was ecstatic, just a short while before I had nearly landed - my track recorder showed I was just 35 meters off the ground.

'And suddenly I was back up at cloud base and I knew I had the record in hand and it was just an insane exclamation point to the best flight I'd ever done.

'There are a lot of pilots in the world right now who could have gone farther than I did, it just takes the right mind-set and a lot of hours in the saddle as we say.

'But the most important thing is getting the right day, and then identifying when you're up there that you've got the day and can push hard.

'I can't wait to see what people will do, and I hope I can continue to be a part of it.'
