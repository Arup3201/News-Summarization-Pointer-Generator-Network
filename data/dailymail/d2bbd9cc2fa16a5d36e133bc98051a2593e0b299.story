They may look like the trails of a motorcycle from the sci-fi film Tron, but in fact these are a far more pedestrian form of transport.

Researchers at City University created the maps to show exactly where people using London's hugely popular cycle hire scheme travelled to.

The maps, which show 5 million journeys, have since been used by transport for London to help them ensure enough bicycles are available for both tourists and commuters.

The animation unfold to show 5 million journeys taken across London.

The images reveal the routes around London users of the Barclays cycle hire scheme use.

The maps reveal an average day in the life of the London bicycle hire scheme and were created by visualisation expert Professor Jo Wood at City University in London.

He based it on data from the first 5 million journeys pedalled in the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme since its launch in July 2010.

'The data comes from TfL, and is publicly available,' he said.

'We were interested in seeing how we could show the behaviour of cyclists using the scheme.

'Because of the scale of the scheme traditional methods didn't work, and we wanted to make something visual.'

The team used glowing purple lines to track the progress of riders over a day, revealing patterns as the amazing images are formed.

The video tracks 5 million journeys taken by users of the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme in London.

The top hire stations from last week were:

1. Waterloo Station, Waterloo - 3,085 hires    2. Hop Exchange, The Borough - 2,131 hires3. Hyde Park Corner, Hyde Park - 2,098 hires    4. Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park - 2,086 hires    5. Belgrove Street, King's Cross - 2,048 hires

'The video is one example of the kind of visualisation we constructed - and it does show very clearly there are different behaviours.

'There are the Hyde Park leisure cyclist touring the parks, who were self contained within the park, creating a rectangle of colour in the the bottom right.

'In contrast there are also commuters showing patterns from the major stations as people pick up bikes at stations and cycle into Central London.

'We also found a third, more complex pattern in the City, where people are moving to Liverpoool street as well as from it during the day.;

although the team initially began creating the maps on their own, they have since started working with Transport for London, who run the scheme.

'Lots of tidal commuting behaviour can mean bikes need to be moved,' said Professor Wood.

'This is helpful in predicting where TfL need to move bikes, and at what time.'

In the animation, the curve of a route indicates the most frequent direction of travel: trajectories leave a station in a straight line and then hook into their destination.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson with bicycles used in scheme, dubbed 'Boris bikes' by many. researchers have now used the data from the journeys to create an incredible colourful map tracing cyclists routes.

First launched in 2010, the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme has been used for over 16 million journeys.

Dubbed 'Boris Bikes' after Mayor of 
London Boris Johnson's enthusiasm for them, the bikes are accessed at 
docking stations dotted around London.

Tourists can use interactive touchscreen stations at each docking point to book cycles, while regular commuters can get special 'keys' allowing to to simply take bikes whenever they want.

Transport for London use the maps to reveal patterns, and work out which stations need to have bikes manually added or removed to keep the system running.

Some have likened the maps to the trails left by 'light cycles' in the sci fi film Tron.
