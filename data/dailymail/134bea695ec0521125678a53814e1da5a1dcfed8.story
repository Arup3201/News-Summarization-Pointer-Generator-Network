Islamic State's children have taken centre stage in the latest propaganda video from the terror group purporting to show the apparent beheading of eight Syrians. 

The video, posted on social media today, claims to show ISIS fighters cutting off the heads of men said to be Shi'ite Muslims. 

The eight men, wearing the orange jumpsuits which have become associated with the group's sick propaganda, were said to beheaded in the central Syrian province of Hama.

Blindfolded and with their hands bound behind their backs, the captives are seen being led forward in a field by teenage boys.

They are then seeing being handed over to a group of masked fighters and each is given a knife from a smiling boy before the hostages are forced to face down on the ground before being butchered.

An Islamic State fighter speaks in the video, using a derogatory term for Shi'ites and calling them 'impure infidels.' 

The fighter says the current military campaign against ISIS will only make them stronger. 

'Our swords will soon, God willing, reach the Nuseiries and their allies like Bashar and his party,' he says - a reference to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group which is fighting on his side.

The word Nuseiry is a derogatory term to refer to Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. 

Lebanese media have reported that one of the murdered men is Younes Hujairi, who was kidnapped from his hometown of Arsal near the Syrian border in January.

The country's state-run National News Agency quoted Mr Hujairi's family as saying he had been beheaded. 

Members of Mr Hujairi's family said they have seen pictures of an IS fighter carrying his severed head on social media, it was reported.

It is not clear if Mr Hujairi was one of one of the men beheaded in the video - as is a Sunni, while the video states that all the beheaded men were Shii'tes.

The border town of Arsal, where Mr Hujairi was kidnapped, was also the site of a bold joint raid by the Islamic State group and Syria's al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front last August.

Smiling: A young boy is seen cheerfully handing out knives to each one of the masked fighters 

Killed: The eight hostages are then forced to face down on the ground before being butchered 

They captured 24 Lebanese soldiers and policemen. Four of those hostages have been killed so far, two of them beheaded by ISIS.

The video could not be immediately independently verified, but it appears to be genuine.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said that the video is authentic.

The terror group has beheaded scores of captives from across the world since capturing large parts of Iraq and Syria last year.

Earlier this month, a video was released showing the beheading of three Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.
