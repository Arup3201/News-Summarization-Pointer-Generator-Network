When you're spending the night alone in a hotel room, a creepy note and a locked door are probably the worst things you could find.

And the mysterious note Amy Jones found in the drawer of her Edinburgh hotel room is like something straight out of a horror movie.

Her Christmas present was a visit to the Scottish capital as a break from her final year of university student, but things took a scary turn when she found the message. 

And when the 21-year-old journalism student posted a picture of it on Twitter, it quickly sparked a frenzy and began to trend.

She wrote: 'So I'm in a hotel in Edinburgh and I've just found this note in one of the drawers...'

And accompanying her tweet was a picture of the note, which said 'Don't open the locked door! Don't trust its whispers! Leave, just lea [sic]'

She followed it up with a picture of the door, captioned: 'This is the door they are referring to. It faces my bed. Cool.' 

Amy, from Salford, told MailOnline: 'I was so amused when I saw the note though a little shocked.

'I showed my mum and we thought it must be kids having a laugh.'

She added: 'It is so funny. Trending on Twitter is hilarious because it was a total jokey tweet and I do a lot of work on social media and this is the thing that got picked up.' 

But she added that she did not want to name the establishment because 'it is a nice hotel and I would not want to damage their reputation'.  

The mysterious note said 'Don't open the locked door! Don't trust its whispers! Leave, just lea [sic]'

She also retained a sense of humour about her spooky situation, with later tweets.

She wrote: 'So if I die tonight let it be known I wanted Falcao as the next Bond ok?'

And later: 'Will everyone make sure they use a selfie in the paper and not a tagged photo yeah?'

She added that she did not want to name the establishment because 'it is a nice hotel and I would not want to damage their reputation'.

Amy, 21, from Salford, then posted a picture of the 'locked door' mentioned in the note
