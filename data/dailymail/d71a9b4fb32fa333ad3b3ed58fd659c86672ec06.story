Burnley's Sean Dyche is grateful for the admiration Neil Warnock has shown him during his time as a manager, but insists there will be no 'love-in' when two winless sides meet at Crystal Palace.

Warnock revealed last season that he voted for Dyche to be the LMA Manager of the Year - over the likes of Tony Pulis and Brendan Rodgers - for his efforts in guiding the unfancied Clarets into the Premier League.

The 65-year-old had also called to offer support to Dyche during the lowest ebb of his fledging career when he was sacked by Watford in the summer of 2012.

But while there is clearly a mutual respect between the two men who will line up in opposite dugouts at Selhurst Park this weekend, the need for a first top-flight win of the season will be Dyche's sole focus.

'He's someone who has shown me an awful lot of respect,' Dyche said of Warnock.

'I know him a little bit and he's always spoken well of myself as a young manager and I do thank him for that because his record speaks for itself at the varying clubs he's had.

'I thought he had chosen the time to say 'no, that's it, I'll go and enjoy the family' - but he's obviously got the bug again which happens in football. It's a great game, that's why we all love it, and he certainly loves it.

'Make no mistake, there will be no love-in when the whistle blows with Neil; he wants his team to perform and so do I.'

Dyche has the chance to blood his three deadline day signings in this fixture after George Boyd, Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane all arrived at Turf Moor to swell one of the thinnest squads in the entire division.

Providing adequate competition for places was always going to be a challenge for the Clarets following a season in which they rarely changed their line-up from week to week, but Dyche is happy that nobody can now be assured of a starting berth.

'We are happy with the business we've done,' added Dyche.

'It rounds the group off in a nice way. We've got demand more or less all over the pitch, there's no safety net for players wondering about their shirt and we wanted that.

'It is hard for clubs like ourselves because we can't carry vast squads, and we probably wouldn't wish to, but when the window shuts, it is shut. There's no loans or anything like that so it means you do have to have a deeper squad.'

Boyd is the only one of the trio who may start at Palace, though, as Chalobah and Keane only trained with their new team-mates for the first time on Thursday after being away with England Under-21s.

In the Clarets' last outing two weeks ago they earned a credible point in a 0-0 draw with a Manchester United team featuring Angel di Maria for the first time.

And Dyche is hopeful that holding the 20-time domestic champions to a stalemate will reinforce the idea that his team are capable of getting results in the Premier League.

'There is a good belief there anyway but I think results like that and performances help,' he argued.

'I felt we handled that well and tactically delivered a good performance against a very strong group of players.

'This idea of a work in progress at Manchester United is true, but if you look at the names on the team-sheet it's still a very good group of players. I think it enhances the belief in the players; I think the belief is there but it just continues to build it.'
