The fiancée of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber has admitted that she previously bought Washington farmland that was intended to be used to illegally grow marijuana.

Cylvia Hayes, 46, bought the $245,000 property at Colville Indian Reservation, Okanogan with her then-boyfriend just months after she was paid $5,000 to marry another man, an immigrant from Ethiopia.

The pot farm revelation, which was reported by The Oregonian on Monday, comes just days after Hayes admitted to the sham marriage and Kitzhaber, 67, revealed he had known nothing of it.

On Monday, retired real estate broker Patrick Siemion told the newspaper that Hayes and her then-boyfriend had bought the remote 60-acre lot in November 1997 with a $16,000 down payment.

Revelations: Cylvia Hayes wipes away a tear at a press conference last week as she admitted she had married an immigrant so he could stay in the U.S. She has now admitted to buying a farm to grow pot in the 90s

Hayes responded with a comment, saying: 'The property in Okanogan was intended to be the site of a marijuana grow operation that never materialized. I was never financially involved with it. I did not pay any part of the down payment or mortgage payments.'

But Siemon told the Oregonian that, after the property went into foreclosure, he found marijuana trimmings, fertilizer and used irrigation tubing, which he believes showed signs pot had been grown.

While he never saw any marijuana growing at the farm, he said that it was clear that the couple had bought the land for its remoteness.

Siemion said he remembered Hayes because the pretty woman struck him as the sort of person he had never pictured living in a remote cabin. He also recalled that she took charge of the meetings.

 'He was not the leader,' Siemion said of the man. 'The leader was her. She did all the talking, all the negotiating. I remember her saying, "Oh this is just the perfect place, we're so happy to have it".' 

In her statement, Hayes said that she had been in a troubled relationship at the time.

'I am not proud of that brief period of time,' she said. 'I was involved in an abusive relationship with a dangerous man.'

KOIN reported that her ex-boyfriend, whose name has not been released, has a history of domestic violence convictions.

Siemion said they paid rent for a few months. Hayes wrote in her statement that she began to make plans to leave in the spring of 1998. By July, she had moved to Oregon.

She added that she hadn't used money she received from her marriage to an Ethiopian immigrant to buy the farm. Instead, that money was used to buy a lap top and pay school expenses, she said. 

Last week, Hayes admitted that she was paid around $5,000 for the 1997 marriage to Ethiopian immigrant Abraham Abraham. The couple filed for divorce in 2001.

On Monday, she faced yet more scrutiny as her fiancee asked a state ethics commission to review her consulting business and how it might affect her role as first lady.

Hayes tripled her 2012-2013 income to at least $85,000 via consulting contracts with organizations seeking to influence state policy, the Willamette Week newspaper reported last week. It added that state-paid staff had given administrative support to Hayes' business.

Hayes is not a state employee and does not collect a state paycheck. But bowing to political pressure, Kitzhaber's general counsel, Liani Reeves, asked the Government Ethics Commission to rule on whether Hayes is a public official and thus subject to state ethics statutes.

Last week, she said at the time of the sham marriage she had been 'associating with the wrong people and struggling to put herself through college and regrets her actions'.

Hayes, 47, also admitted she did never told the governor about the marriage.

The marriage, her third, was uncovered when the Willamette Week newspaper began asking questions. She had previously claimed to have only been married twice.

Governor Kitzhaber met Hayes in 2002 and the two became engaged earlier this year.

On Friday, he said he was hurt when he learned about the fraudulent marriage.

'I learned this three days ago,' Kitzhaber said at the City Club of Portland. 'I was obviously very taken aback by it and hurt. I have some processing to do on that.'
