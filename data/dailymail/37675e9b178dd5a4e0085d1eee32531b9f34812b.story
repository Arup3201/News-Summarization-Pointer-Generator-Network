Ram Singh was among the five men and a juvenile awaiting trial for the brutal attack on the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist

The parents of Ram Singh, the man accused of the gang rape and murder of a woman on a New Delhi bus, who was today found hanged in his prison cell, say their son was killed.

Police reported the 34-year-old committed suicide after he was found hanged with his own clothes in Tihar jail.

But his family dispute the claim, saying Singh was not suicidal and his injured hand would prevent him from killing himslef.

Singh was among the five men and a juvenile awaiting trial for the brutal attack on the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist in the Indian capital in December last year.

The assault triggered nationwide protests and an intense debate about rampant crime against women in India. 

After Singh was found dead India's deputy home minister, RPN Singh,
said an inquiry had been ordered into the suicide, according to the 
Press Trust of India.

Singh's family and lawyer alleged foul play over his death.

His lawyer VK Anand said: 'There were no circumstances which could
have led to Ram Singh committing suicide. There was no mental stress. 
He was very happy.'

Lawyers for the 
defendants had previously accused police of beating confessions out of 
the men.

Singh's father, Mangelal Singh, said
his son had been raped in prison by other inmates and had been 
repeatedly threatened by inmates and guards.

Nevertheless, he said he 
visited his son four days ago and he appeared fine and gave no hint of 
the despair that could drive him to take his own life.

Singh also had a badly injured 
hand and would have been unable to orchestrate a suicide, his father 
said, speaking from outside his small home in a New Delhi slum.

'Somebody has killed him,' he said, insisting he would push for a top-level investigation into the death.

Mangelal Singh said he feared for the safety of another son who is also on trial in the rape case.

The defendants were being housed in 
separate buildings on the jail grounds and were all under suicide watch,
a jail official said.

Indian jails have a reputation for overcrowding, poor management and brutal treatment of inmates.

The brother of the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist who was brutally attacked said: 'He knew he was 
going to die anyway because we had and still have such a strong case 
against him.'

'I'm not very thrilled with the news that he killed himself because I wanted him to be hanged... publicly.

'Him dying on his own terms seems unfair. But, oh well, one is down. Hopefully the rest will wait for their death sentence.' 

The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court last month while the juvenile's trial began last week.

Singh's brother Mukesh Singh, gym assistant Vinay Sharma, bus cleaner 
Akshay Kumar Singh and fruit vendor Pawan Kumar are the other men on 
trial.

Police allege the six attacked the 
woman and her male companion on the bus as the couple returned home 
after watching Life Of Pi on December 16.

The
woman was repeatedly raped and tortured with a metal bar. The couple 
were also severely beaten before being thrown onto a road.

The woman died of internal injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks later.

Singh
was a bus driver, despite an accident in 2009 that fractured his right 
arm so badly that doctors had to insert a rod to support it.

Suicide: The alleged murderer is believed to have killed himself with his own clothes

He appeared on a reality television 
show in a compensation dispute with a bus owner, who in turn accused 
Singh of 'drunken, negligent and rash driving'.

In the show, the moustachioed, slightly-built man was seen walking stiffly and holding his right arm at an awkward angle.

Singh's neighbours in the south Delhi slum where he lived described him as a heavy drinker with a temper.

One young woman said he used to get embroiled in violent rows and a relative recalled a physical altercation with her husband.

The assault triggered nationwide protests and an intense debate about rampant crime against women in India

Ram Singh was one of five suspects charged with murder and rape. Here two of them can be seen led into an Indian court. If found guilty they could face the death sentence

Singh's death comes as the trial 
continued, with another hearing having been held today. The four surviving 
defendants were produced in court, but left after a short time because 
their lawyers were not there as there was an attorney's strike.

KTS Tulsi, a former top lawyer in the
office of the solicitor general of India, said the suicide should have 
no impact on the trial, which is being held in a closed courtroom under a
gag order which prevents news organisations from publishing details of 
the proceedings.

He said Singh's death highlighted how
important it was for society not to demonise people who have been 
accused of crimes but not yet been convicted.

'It is so unfortunate that the media 
goes on to presume that they are guilty and goes on to condemn them and 
demonise them to an extent that it makes the life of these people not 
worth living,' he said.

In 2011, 68 inmates in India died by 
suicide and another eight were killed by fellow inmates, according to 
India's National Crime Records Bureau.

Tihar Jail is badly overcrowded, with
nearly twice as many prisoners as it was designed to hold. Jail 
authorities have been working to soften its reputation in part by 
selling TJ's cookies baked by the inmates to the public.
