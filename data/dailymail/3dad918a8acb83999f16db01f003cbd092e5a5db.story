Liverpool and Arsenal played 99 minutes of football at Anfield but Fabio Borini lasted just 18 before being sent off.

Brendan Rodgers' side took the lead in the first half through Philippe Coutinho but Mathieu Debuchy equalised less than two minutes later.

The Gunners went ahead courtesy of Olivier Giroud but Martin Skrtel levelled the scores in the 97th minute of play.

Borini was brought on for Lazar Markovic when the Reds were behind but the Italian forward lasted just 18 minutes before being sent back to the dressing room.

First Michael Oliver booked the former Roma man in the 90th minute after he threw the ball away in anger at one of the linesman's decisions. 

And in the 92nd minute he was shown a second yellow card for a high challenge on Santi Cazorla.

The Spaniard, who was involved in both incidents, was left with a tear in his shirt that exposed both his nipple and the bloody evidence of Borini's raking studs.
