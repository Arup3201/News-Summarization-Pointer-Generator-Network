A week after facing criticism for pre-recording their Sunday night results show, it appeared The Voice's hosts and judges went to a little effort to make last night's episode appear fresher by changing their clothes.

However, fans of the show took to Twitter in their droves to complain that the contestants were stuck in the same old outfits, while co-hosts Holly Willoughby and Reggie Yates and the judging panel had obviously changed.

Twitter hashtags such as 'youdon'tfoolme' and 'imnotstupidbbc1' appeared on the micro-blogging site after fans questioned why only the celebrities on the show were in different ensembles, but not the contestants.

Something different: The judges had been wearing different ensembles for Saturday night's live show

One Twitter user wrote: 'When The Voice pretend (sic) to be live by changing their outfits when we all know it's pre-recorded from last night.'

Another tweeted: 'The Voice are tricking us again. The 
judges may have changed their outfits but everyone's hair and makeup are
still the same. #puzzled.'

A third follower wrote: 'Why 'ave the contestants on The Voice got the same outfits on as yesterday ? #tightb***ards.'

Most notably, TV presenter Willoughby 
had covered up her famous cleavage from a plunging black dress on 
Saturday to a high-necked gold sequinned mini dress on Sunday.

Judge Jessie J was now in a gold Sass & Bide dress after wearing an eclectic yellow trouser suit for the previous night's episode.

Sunday's night show saw students Hannah Bierney and Ruth-Ann St.Luce evicted from the contest.

Meanwhile, Britain's Got Talent beat The Voice for the second week in a row on Saturday night.

BGT's pre-recorded auditions attracted 9.5million, compared to The Voice's 8.2million - down over a million from last week.

Last
week, The Voice lost in the ratings battling with Britain's Got Talent 
with their Saturday night live show pulling in 9.3million and 9.9million
respectively.

Their Sunday pre-recorded results show averaged 8.6million, with viewers apparently put off by the non-live nature of the episode.

Last week, a show insider admitted that The Voice’s results shows were pre-recorded to save money, adding that it would cost ‘an extortionate amount’ to film them live.

The competition’s telephone voting lines were closed at 9pm last Saturday night – having opened only half an hour earlier.

The BBC source told the Daily Mail last week: 'We already pre-record the results show on Strictly Come Dancing.

'We can’t broadcast [The Voice's] 
results live on Saturday, as we would clash with Britain’s Got Talent 
and we wanted to avoid this.

'If we did broadcast live on Sunday, we would be accused of wasting licence fee payers’ money.'

A Corporation spokesman said the show’s results would continue to be pre-recorded up until the live final on Saturday, June 2.

She
added: 'The Sunday results shows are recorded "as live" after the phone
lines have closed on Saturday night. This is standard practice for a 
BBC entertainment show and ensures the best use of licence fee payers' 
money.'
