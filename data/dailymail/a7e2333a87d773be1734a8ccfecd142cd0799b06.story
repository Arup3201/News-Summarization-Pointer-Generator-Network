Two men are  halfway up what has been called the hardest rock climb in the world - a free climb up a half-mile section of exposed granite in California's Yosemite National Park.

Tommy Caldwell, 36, of Estes Park, Colorado, and Keven Jorgeson, 30, of Santa Rosa, California, have been scaling their way up the face of the 3,000 feet granite monolith of El Capitan in Yosemite using only their hands and feet.

Most ascents up the imposing rock face use an approach known as aid climbing, where ropes and metal pins are used to assist the climbers.

However, the Caldwell and Jorgeson are instead attempting to cleanly free climb a route that has never before been climbed without aid.

Their progress up the 32 sections, or pitches, of climbing is being chronicled by climber and photographer Tom Evans and filmmaker Brett Lowell.

The two men eat, stretch and sleep in hanging tents suspended to El Capitan's Dawn Wall. They don't have the creature comforts of home, but they have kept in touch with the outside world thanks to social media - tweeting, posting on Facebook, feeding information for blogs and keeping in touch with a bevy of supporters on the ground. 

Time to relax: On Monday, the pair took a rest day to heal their hands in preparation for another day on the rock face on Tuesday. Above, Kevin Jorgeson relaxes in his portaledge tent, which is attached to the rock face and hangs above the Yosemite Valley floor far below

Daring: Free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent. Above, Caldwell makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on El Capitan using a headlamp on Sunday night

Record breakers: If they are successful, Jorgeson and Caldwell will be the first team to free climb El Capitan's imposing Dawn Wall

'The guys are doing great,' said Josh Lowell with Big Up Productions, which has been filming the pair as they have battled with the route over the past six years. 

'(Monday) they are resting and trying to grow skin back on their fingertips so they can continue to do battle with the hardest climbing sections, which involve grabbing tiny, razor-sharp edges of rock.'

If all goes as planned, the duo could be at the top as soon as Friday or Saturday, Lowell said. 

'But that's best-case scenario. It could take several more days just to get through the difficult section where they currently are. If any weather moves in, that could also delay things, but the forecast is looking good for now,' he said.

It will be the culmination of a six year project to conquer the route that they have called the Dawn Wall. 

Until now the pair have been gradually edging their way up the route one pitch at a time, practicing each move until they have been able to climb freely up the holds without falling or the need for assistance from aid climbing equipment. 

Previous attempts to climb the route cleanly have been beset with problems. Caldwell and Jorgeson tried to climb it all in 2010, but storms halted their progress about a third of the way up while in 2011 Jorgeson broke an ankle after falling during an attempt. 

Just after Christmas 2014 the pair began their latest attempt to finally climb the entire route without stopping. 

Progress: If all goes well, the pair could reach the summit of El Capitan as early as Friday or Saturday. Above, Caldwell makes his way up the rock face on Sunday

Daunting: At 3,000-feet-tall, El Capitan is the largest monolith of granite in the world and one of the most difficult climbs

Many have climbed Dawn Wall but the pair would be the first to 'free climb' the section using ropes only as a safeguard against falls. Previous ascensionist have used ropes and metal pitons to help pull themselves upwards, as well as to stop them plummeting to the ground if they fall. 

Caldwell and Jorgenson are pulling themselves up the route using only the tiny holds they can find on the rock. For Caldwell this has meant overcoming a DIY accident where he cut off much of his left index finger with a table saw in 2001.

He has trained with his remaining figures to build up their strength. But the razor sharp granite holds on Dawn Wall has now led both Caldwell and Jorgeson to tape their finger tips as the rock has shredded their skin. 

The first climber reached El Capitan's summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top.

Evans said the two have a cellphone on their ascent, but they weren not taking calls Monday because they were resting and 'want no distractions while on the cliff.' The two also were not answering emails from roughly 1,500 feet above the ground.

Not out of the loop: The pair keep in touch with the outside world using a cellphone they brought with them on the climb, using it to tweet and post updates to the social networking site Facebook. However, on Monday they stayed off the device to focus on resting

These practices may not seem unusual, but the climbers have relied heavily on social media to document their adventure. Both update their Facebook pages regularly and tweet from the Dawn Wall, which has been called 'as smooth as alabaster, as steep as the bedroom wall.'

Last Friday, Jorgeson hosted a live question-and-answer session from the wall.

Worst is over: There are 32 sections of El Capitan to climb, but the pair have already finished the three hardest sections of the route

Caldwell's wife', Becca, has also been blogging about their trip daily and wrote this post last weekend.

'Being up on the wall for over a week and the hard climbing Tommy and Kevin have done up until now adds an element of difficulty on top of the hard climbing they have to do,' she wrote. 

'Imagine performing your very best after not walking for one week.  I know Tommy has made an effort to try and do stretching, pushups, (and) yoga in the (hanging tent) hoping this might combat the unusual circumstances of living like veal between their climbing.  So let's hope for big things today. This climb definitely won't be over until it's over, but I believe it's possible. Let's go boys!!!'

Jorgeson tweeted late Saturday about his difficulty scaling one section: 'Battling. #dawnwall.'

On December 30 the pair managed to compete the hardest section of the wall - the first traverse at around pitch 14.

Writing on Facebook later that evening, Jorgeson said: 'Tonight, I sent the hardest pitch of my life and the hardest on the Dawn Wall! Best of all, Tommy sent right after me! Pitch 14 (the first traverse) is in the bag!'

Caldwell added: 'The hardest pitch got sent by both of us tonight. I might be in a little shock right now. The route is taking a toll on our fingertips as we are now both climbing with taped up fingertips, but it doesn't seem to be slowing us down too much.'

There are 32 sections of the climb. On Sunday night, Lowell said Caldwell, climbing in the dark, completed the last of the three hardest sections of climbing, which was a major breakthrough, Lowell said.

'He still has 1,500 feet of hard, scary climbing ahead, but mentally he is feeling really confident right now, and incredibly excited. (Jorgeson) is extremely close to completing pitch 15, one of the hardest. (Tuesday) he will try to complete it and catch up to Tommy so they can continue forging ahead.'

In 1970, Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell (no relation to Tommy Caldwell) climbed Dawn Wall using ropes and countless rivets over 27 days.

The duo prepared for at least six years for the climb, according to friends and their personal websites. John Long, the first person to climb El Capitan in one day in 1975, said he speaks to the climbers several times a day.

'It's almost inconceivable that anyone could do something that continuously difficult,' he said Monday, adding that he believes they spent the equivalent of a year's time on the wall in preparation for the climb.

To follow Jorgeson and Caldwell on their journey, follow them on Instagram. Big UP Productions and photographer Corey Rich are also capturing the two as they ascend the monolith, and both have been posting pictures of the monumental climb on Instagram as well.
