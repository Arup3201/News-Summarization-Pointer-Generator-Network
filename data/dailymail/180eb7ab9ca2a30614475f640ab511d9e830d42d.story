With a kaleidoscope of vivid colours, these images may look like stained glass, but they are in fact extreme close-ups of popular Christmas drinks.

Taken through a microscope, the photographs show drops of two Italian aperitifs, Campari and Aperol, which had been left to dry on a glass slide.

After the alcohol and water evaporates, the remaining sugars then crystallise to produce the stunning colours.

Bernardo Cesare, a Professor of Petrology at the University of Padova, Italy, took the pictures using a camera mounted on an optical microscope.

These images may look like stained glass, but they are in fact extreme close-ups of popular Christmas drinks

Taken through a microscope, the photographs show drops of two Italian aperitifs, Campari and Aperol, which had been left to dry on a glass slide 

The 51-year-old said: 'I used a camera mounted on an optical microscope, the same as those used by geologists to study rock fragments.

'I put drops on glass slides and after the drinks crystallised, I placed the slides under the microscope.

'The polarised light then passed through the crystals which enabled me to take photographs when the image was particularly appealing.

'I wanted to capture this effect because I knew alcoholic drinks could be exciting subjects.

'I like the images because of the variety of colours and textures - after a long wait the photos are really beautiful.'

The married father-of-two had to wait two months for the Aperol to crystallise.

'There are difficulties when taking these photographs. Even though the subject is fairly ordinary, most of us have no idea of how it is made at a small scale and how the textures of materials look like under a microscope.

'To me, as a scientist and a geologist, these images recall the way minerals crystallise in rocks, in particularly igneous and sedimentary.

'But the first and greatest difficulty is simply to have the solution crystallise.

'While Campari took a couple of days, Aperol didn't do anything for two months.'
