They look like everyday objects - a corn of cob, some matchsticks and a wine cork.

But peer a little closer and these mundane objects so typically overlooked contain an entire world - that is, if Brazilian artist William Kass has anything to do with it.

From an ice cream cone to a man's shaving brush, the imaginative architect, 32, creates familiar scenes from films and everyday life using food and household objects as substitutes for the scenery.

'Spring break on a plate': Cauliflower, biscuits and fruit loops cereal are used to create a vision of palm trees, rubber rings and sandy beach bars in this particular piece

Hikers struggle to reach the peak of this corn cob 'mountain' while 'Shaving Brush Savannah' shows a man wading through the 'grass' of a brush to hunt down a stag

He photographs tiny figurines in his carefully constructed sets to create a series of eye-catching images.

Just one of the mini marvels can take William, from Sao Paulo, Brazil, up to three days to complete as he painstakingly arranges and lights the scenes in his home office turned studio.

He said: 'I started my work this year, the project is called Minimize.

'I am an architect and I wanted to use my skills to create something which shows humans in a surreal, macro world.

Under fire: Soldiers walk through a paint-splattered war zone, shielding themselves as they are attacked from above

Dancing in the rain! A ballet dancer gracefully spins while surrounded by water encircling her - the illusion of a rainy day was created by placing her on top of a shower head

'My work can be a way to draw attention to the small details of our daily life using foods and daily objects as a scenery.

'I buy small dolls which I use in each of my images. I use the dolls and create a scene for them using everyday objects or food.

'In some cases I try to do a remake of a movie scene.

'Depending on the scene, I can spend anywhere between one and three days creating each image.'

In one image neighbours can be seen mowing and trimming their 'gardens', which are actually hairy cocount shells.

Another different world shows a pair of spacesuit-clad people trekking through a wild territory to investigate a body in a time-shell - but further inspection reveals that it is a pair of models wading through spaghetti to peer inside half of a cherry tomato.

Abandon ship: A scene from The Titanic is produced using upside down wafer cones, with blocks of ice creams, as a replica of the ship sinks in the background.

All aboard! These figures dash between the pillars of a train station - which is actually made up of wine corks carefully balanced on a wooden floor

The Untouchables is given a whole new spin as the steps with the buggy falling down the steps are actually stairs made from crackers

For
another of his images, William Kass uses the inside of a watermelon as 
the setting for a scene showing the first man on Mars and in another he 
uses ice-cream cones as icebergs to show the sinking of the Titanic.

'I have a home office, which doubles up as a studio, but I'm looking for a place outside of my house to continue my work,' he said.

'The main difficulties I face when creating my work are when I use food to create the scenarios as the food spoils easily.

'For example for the image called Titanic, I used real ice cream, so I had to study the lighting before as the ice cream melts too fast.

Into the unknown: Spacemen wade across the alien land to inspect a time capsule - created from strands of pasta and cherry tomatoes

Emergency! Firefighters tackle a blaze in a matchbox, as they try and clamber through a smouldering pile of charred matchsticks

Tending to the fields: Miniature mowers tend to their coconut lawns as they snip hairs on the shells and rake in the straggly fine threads

Party time! These dancers are surrounded by bright lights and look like they're having fun - undoubtedly helped by the thrill of perching on a bunch of grapes

'Every scene that I imagine is a challenge. Most of the time, when I'm producing the scene, it ends up a little bit different than I first imagined.

'My favourite image is the "Shaving brush Savannah" because of the simplicity of the image, it's simple but at the same time it is also a strong image.

'I also like the "Spring Break" because of the composition.

'Since the beginning of this year I've been working full time on my photography creating images for the art and advertising markets.'

'For me, this project is great. I'm loving this series.

'It is constantly a work in progress as I continue to come up with new ideas for scenes.'
