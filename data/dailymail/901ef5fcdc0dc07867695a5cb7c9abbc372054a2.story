Two teenagers have died after plunging through thin ice while fishing at a rock quarry in rural Indiana.

Clark 'Edward' Shoemaker, 17, and Dominic Arthur, 13, were fishing with family at the quarry just north of Spencer on Sunday when they fell into about 11 feet of water.

After receiving a 911 call, first responders raced to the scene and had to navigate steep, rocky terrain to reach the edge of the water. Divers found the pair within minutes.

Dramatic: Scene photographs show a team of rescuers near the hole in the ice at the quarry

Pulled out: Indiana Conservation Officer divers found the boys in the water two minutes after going in

The boys, who are believed to have been in the water for 90 minutes in total, were rushed to IU Health Bloomington, where they were pronounced dead.

The ice was less than three inches thick when the boys fell through, the state Department of Natural Resources reported.

Dramatic images of the search show that the ice broke several feet from rocks.

Indiana Conservation Officers said that the warming temperatures had also weakened the ice.

Temperatures in the area have been around 40 F (4.4 C). 

Terrifying: Workers can be seen near the broken ice, which was less than three inches thick at the time

Hopeful: Rescue workers look for the two teenagers, who are thought to have spent 90 minutes in the water

At least four inches of fresh, solid ice is considered safe for ice fishing, the DNR said, and they warn people to always verify the thickness of the ice before venturing out on it. 

Autopsies on the bodies are scheduled for Monday at Terre Haute Regional Hospital, Fox59 reported.

On Monday, relatives shared photos of the boys to Facebook, commenting on how they never saw 13-year-old Dominic without a smile on his face. 

'RIP Dominic. We love you and going to miss you!' one relative wrote as he shared an image of the youngster grinning behind the wheel of a car.

Loss: The young friends were both rushed to IU Health Bloomington, but they were pronounced dead

Tribute: A relative shared this image of grinning Dominic behind the wheel of the car, saying: 'WE LOVE YOU!'
