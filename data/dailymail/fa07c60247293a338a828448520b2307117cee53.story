Yoga can re-energise women who have battled breast cancer.

Just three months of practising postures, breathing and meditation cut fatigue in cancer survivors by more than half.

Inflammation, which is linked to health problems from heart disease to frailty, and increases the odds of cancer coming back, was also eased.

The large, U.S. based study suggests that something as cheap and gentle as yoga could be of huge benefit to breast cancer patients.

Breast cancer is Britain’s most common cancer with almost 50,000 cases a year.

Survival rates are improving but the gruelling treatments can leave women feeling worn out for months – or even years – after they have stopped.

The Ohio State University researchers recruited 200 women who had survived cancer of varying degrees of severity.

Half were asked to attend 90-minute yoga classes twice a week and practise at home, if they could.

The other women were told to go about life as normal but promised yoga classes after the study was finished.

The women, who had undergone surgery and powerful treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were also quizzed about their energy levels and subjected to blood tests.

None had done any yoga before the start of the study.

Three months after the yoga classes had ended, fatigue was an average of 57 per cent lower in attendees, the Journal of Clinical Oncology reports.

This is important as persistent tiredness can make people more frail by reducing the amount of exercise they are able to do. As a result, even day-to-day activities become more challenging.

The study also showed that the more yoga a woman did, the greater the boost in energy levels.

Blood tests showed a reduction in levels of compounds linked to the inflammation.

It is thought that better sleep, helped by the yoga, could have cut fatigue and inflammation and allowed the cancer survivors to do more and so enhanced their quality of life.

The psychological benefits of yoga have been much studied but this research is some of the first to pin down some of the underlying biology.

Researcher Professor Janet Kiecolt-Glaser said the women may have benefited from improvements in their breathing and the stress relief of mediation.

Better sleep could have cut fatigue and inflammation and allowed the women to do more and so enhanced their quality of life.

She said: ‘This showed that modest yoga practice over a period of several months could have substantial benefits for breast cancer survivors.’

The professor added that yoga sessions could give others – including the elderly – an energy boost.

Eluned Hughes, of charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘More people are getting breast cancer than ever before which means quality of life after treatment is increasingly important.

‘These are promising results which suggest that yoga could reduce fatigue and inflammation after treatment; improving well-being for many breast cancer survivors.’
