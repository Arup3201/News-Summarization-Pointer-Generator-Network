Beer company Heineken is changing the design of its iconic green bottle for the first time since 1946.

The revamped 'Star Bottle' has already been rolled-out in New York State and is set to hit the nation's bars and shops in March 2013.

The Star Bottle will be available in 12 
oz and 22 oz sizes as before - but it features a taller, thinner shape, giving it a 'more modern and premium look', according to the company.

Raise a glass: The instantly-recognisable bottle design has not changed for more than 60 years. The new bottle will be sold nationwide from March 2013.

'The newly-designed Star Bottle allows Heineken to take a huge step forward in the globalisation of the brand', said Colin Westcott-Pitt, Heineken USA VP of marketing.

He added: 'The Heineken bottle has gone through a number of progressions but has always maintained its core iconography that has become a symbol of upscale premium beer, and this philosophy will remain the same with the new Star Bottle design.'

The company says the 100-year-old recipe for the beer remains the same.

The new bottle also features an embossed thumb groove that the company claims improves grip and encourages people to hold the bottle at a lower point, keeping the beer colder.

The company, started in 1873 in Holland, is just one of a number of big brands to have signed lucrative product-placement deals for new Bond film Skyfall. Bond, played by actor Daniel Craig, appears in the film drinking a bottle. In 2011, 2.74 billion litres of Heineken was produced worldwide.
