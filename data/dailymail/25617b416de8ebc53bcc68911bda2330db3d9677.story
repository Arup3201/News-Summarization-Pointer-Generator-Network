Liverpool loanee Divock Origi may have failed to get on the scoresheet for Lille against his soon-to-be Merseyside rivals Everton on Thursday night, but the Belgian striker still managed to put in a performance that will already rank him above Mario Balotelli in the current estimations of Reds fans.

Despite being unable to breach Tim Howard's goal during the forgettable 0-0 draw, the 19-year-old striker was a constant thorn in Everton’s side as he tested Sylvain Distin on several occasions with his pace and power.

Origi took just two minutes to prove his strength, outmuscling Gareth Barry in the centre of the Stade Pierre-Mauroy pitch before unleashing the dangerous Sebastien Corchia, who saw his shot on goal saved.

In a half which was dominated by the home side, Origi saved his best bit of play for the 20th minute, when the youngster jinked past Leighton Baines before breezing all too easily past Distin and hitting a low cross towards Ronny Rodelin.

This moment of magic had the Lille faithful on their feet and no doubt Liverpool fans will have been watching with excitement as they look forward to Origi gracing the Anfield turf next season, perhaps in place of Balotelli, who is yet to score a Premier League goal for his new team.

Origi, who sealed a £10million move to Liverpool following an impressive World Cup campaign, played mainly through the middle of a Lille front three, but wasn’t afraid to drift over to the wings in an attempt to make space for his team-mates, often occupying two defenders at a time.

The forward, perhaps understandably, spent part of his time on the field targeting Everton veteran Tony Hibbert, but on the two occasions Origi raced past the 33-year-old, he wasted possession with overhit crosses.

Origi, hailed as a ‘monster’ by Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany, started the second half brightly with a neat turn on the edge of Everton’s box before firing a powerful right-footed strike just wide of Howard’s goal.

As the second 45 minutes dragged on in a less than inspiring Europa League clash, Origi remained a threat, winning corners and making intelligent runs. But as his team tired around him, Distin and Jagielka finally seemed to get to grips with the frontman, even if it did take them all of 80 minutes.

Of course, there’s little doubt that Origi is far from the finished product and he is by no means the answer to Liverpool’s problems just yet. He didn’t always manage to maintain possession for his side as he should have done and there are elements to his game that will need time to improve such as his crossing from wide areas.

But what Brendan Rodgers will have on his hands next season is a young striker packed with raw talent and one that is prepared to put in the hard yards for his team.

Power, speed and ability aside, perhaps what will please the Liverpool fans even more is the fact that there wasn’t a half-time shirt swap in sight.
