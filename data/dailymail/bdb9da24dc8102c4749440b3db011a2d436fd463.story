The Malaysian cyclist who competed in gloves bearing the motif 'Save Gaza' at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome has announced he has avoided expulsion from the Commonwealth Games.

The Commonwealth Games Federation was looking into Azizulhasni Awang's apparent political protest, which saw him hold his gloves up to a camera on Thursday to show 'Save' written across the right one and 'Gaza' on the left.

The CGF seeks to avoid its competitions being used for political means, and Glasgow 2014 officials might have imposed a heavy punishment on the 26-year-old, who was set to compete in the individual sprint quarter-finals on Friday.

However it appears a warning and instruction not to wear the gloves again will be the limit of his punishment.

Awang insisted his message was 'humanitarian' rather than politically charged.

He wrote on Facebook: 'I feel sorry to the people who misinterpret my message. There's no such thing with political protest.

All clear: The Malaysian will be allowed to continue his men's sprint campaign in Glasgow

'It's from the bottom of my heart to express humanitarian. Since when expressing humanitarian considered as political?

'Anyway, I apologise to those who think I'm doing wrong and thanks a lot to everyone who always keep supporting me. There's no word that i can express it.

'For your information, I got a warning and still can race today but without my 'Save Gaza' glove. Thanks everyone for your support and really appreciate it. We all stand as a human.'

Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said at Friday's daily media briefing: 'The actions were investigated and we spoke with the Malaysian team management and it's a matter for the management to address.

'It's inappropriate for any form of protest in a Games venue - we respect everyone's right to protest out-with.

'He has had a strong reprimand from his team management and he has apologised. In apologising profusely he now knows any repetition will see a removal of his accreditation.'
