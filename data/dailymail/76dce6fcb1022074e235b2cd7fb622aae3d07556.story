Lobbyists are buying up ad space on ESPN to get their message across to sports-mad President Barack Obama and his White House team.

Political strategists have revealed how they have begun suggesting the all-sports network to clients who want Obama and his officials to hear their concerns.

The President and his staff, as well as other influential Washington figures, are reputed to be regular viewers of the broadcaster, which currently has a near monopoly on sports coverage.

President Barack Obama does a behind the back move with a basketball: Lobbyists have begun taking out ads on sports network ESPN that are targeted at the sports-mad president and his team

That's despite one ESPN host branding the commander-in-chief's dismal display of his own basketball skills last month 'the most embarrassing moment of his entire presidency.'

Companies and organisations have been cagey about the tactic, but those suspected of using it include Microsoft, the American Petroleum Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

Bruce Haynes of bipartisan public affairs firm Purple Strategies told Politico that he and colleagues had begun advising clients to advertise on ESPN.

'The data is clear that a significant amount of elites and influencers are watching ESPN and sports programs and that there is really a high value to being on those networks,' he said.

'You are much more likely to get the eyeballs you want than being on some other places.'

Microsoft is one of the companies that have taken out adverts on ESPN that seem more directed at decision makers rather than consumers.

The personal computer software giant took out slots on Monday Night Football programming to directly criticise rival Google as part of its Scroogled campaign.

That campaign, which is still running on ESPN in Washington, raised questions about Google's business practices just as federal watchdogs considered taking action against the online ads and search firm over competition issues.

But advertisers with an issue to push are not just using ESPN to target influential political figures.

Strategists say the broadcaster is one of the few that people still watch in real-time, and adverts can also reach important non-ideological voters whose points of view are more susceptible to persuasion.

Jim Spellane, spokesman for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said advertising on ESPN is part of a broader effort to reintroduce the union to the general public.

But, he added, 'it doesn't hurt that an influential audience and electeds watch ESPN [too].'

It is also a useful channel to get through to 'non-ideological' voters
