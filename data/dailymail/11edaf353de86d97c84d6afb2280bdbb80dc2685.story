Hospital staff witnessed a teen mother choking her newborn baby twice, and investigators say the abuse was acted out in an attempt to get attention.

On Monday, Florida prosecutors released video showing 19-year-old Brenna Winter admitting to police that she choked her baby on purpose. 

While doctors fought to revive the girl who stopped breathing, Winter started posting on Facebook, sharing pictures of her child and telling her friends that the girl almost died.

The baby, who has not been named, was rescued by nurses after the second attack and has been placed in foster care.

Winter, of St Cloud, dropped out of school at the age of 18 to take care of the newborn, but told police that she became stressed trying to provide for the baby without a job.

Her mother was helping take care of the child as well, but got behind on work assignments and  Winter felt like she was becoming a burden.

Last June, Winter took her child to Nemours Children's Hospital on two consecutive days, June 1 and 2, complaining the child was vomiting blood. 

The child was admitted to the hospital on the second visit when staff found a small cut 'of unknown origin' at the base of the child's esophagus. 

Then, just after 6pm on June 6, the baby stopped breathing, setting of an alarm for hospital staff. 

Nurses looked at the livefeed camera in the baby's room and saw Winter with her hands in the child's crib. 

They rushed into the room and were able to get the child breathing again and the mother was allowed to stay in the room. 

But just a few hours later, a sitter stationed in the room witnessed the mother 'breastfeeding' the child and 'holding [the girl] so tightly that [her] heart rate dropped]' - setting the alarm off again.

After one of the incidents, Winter posted a picture on Facebook of doctors attending to her child, writing that her girl 'stopped breathing and was turning blue. I can't stop shaking. There [sic] helping her now. God that was scary. I almost lost my baby girl.'

Winter was interviewed by police after the incident, and she initially defended her actions.

She claimed she was just trying to help the congested baby breathe when she was first noticed with her hands in the crib. 

'When they said they saw me in the video with my hands on her, I was trying to make sure she was breathing. I wasn't trying to stop her from breathing,' a crying Winter told detectives. 

Protected: Doctors were able to resuscitate Winter's child, and the baby girl has since been placed in foster care 

Attention grab: While doctors were working to resuscitate her child, Winter started posting pictures to Facebook, telling her friends how the baby girl almost died 

But she later admitted to seeking attention, she police pressed her about the second incident.  

When she was breastfeeding the baby, Winter said 'I held her too close and she couldn't breathe'. 

Police then asked her if she 'got a lot of attention' after the nurses came in, and Winter said 'Yeah'.   

'That was your intent, because you can't handle the baby, is that right? Is that a yes?' a detective asked. 

'Yeah,' Winter said again. 

'I was just really stressed out and I wasn't thinking, but I wasn't trying to hurt her,' Winter said. 'I was stressed out and I was trying to relieve the problem but I knew that wasn't gonna work...'

Winter has been in Orange County jail since June, held without bail. 

She faces charges of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and battery by strangulation. 

Her trial is set to begin in November.
