Police on Tuesday obtained an arrest warrant against Jesse Matthew for the abduction of Hannah Graham 

An 'aggressive' manhunt was continuing today for the man suspected of kidnapping UVA student Hannah Graham.

Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person seen with the 18-year-old before she disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the early hours of September 13. 

An arrest warrant was issued on Tuesday for Matthew on a charge of felony abduction with intent to defile - which under Virginia law means intent to commit a sexual assault.

It was revealed on Wednesday that Matthew also has a long list of previous charges against him - from assault and grand larceny to trespassing and being in possession of stolen property.

Online court records showed that Matthew was convicted of trespassing in 2010 but provide no details about the incident. 

He also faces a slew of traffic violations, according to WSLS. 

In June 2009, Matthew allegedly assaulted someone during an attempted theft of a cell phone but the charges were later dropped. 

Matthew has hired a former prosecutor as an attorney, WUSA9 reported on Wednesday afternoon. 

James Camblos, a veteran attorney, told the station that he had spoken to Matthew but would not confirm if he knew his client's current location. Calls to Mr Camblos office were not returned to MailOnline today.

University of Virginia sophomore Hannah Graham, 18, disappeared in the early hours of September 13 in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Matthew was seen with Graham in the downtown mall in the early hours, putting his arms around her waist.

He is still on the run today after fleeing a police station on Saturday. 

A new ‘wanted’ poster issued on Tuesday revealed that Matthew, who is 6'2 and weighs 270lb, was last seen on Sunday driving his sister's 1997 model blue Nissan Sentra with Virginia plates. 

Matthew has contacts and associates in New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C.

Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo said the FBI and Virginia State Police were now joining his team in 'aggressively pursuing'  Matthew but he appealed to members of the public – ‘in every state’ – to help track him down.

Chief Longo said: ‘We are trying to locate Mr Matthew. State and federal resources have been released to help accomplish that task.

‘We want people to know that Mr Matthew is wanted for this very serious offence.’

Hundreds of volunteers have been trawling a 14-square mile area around Charlottesville, looking for anything that might help with the on-going investigation.

Miss Graham's disappearance has sent a ripple of fear through the quiet college town of Charlottesville. 

University president Teresa Sullivan said in a written statement on Tuesday that local and campus police have increased patrols, and the university has expanded the hours of a program that provides late-night van transportation for students.

Students have said they've begun walking in pairs at night and are paying closer attention to their surroundings.

Authorities have searched Matthew's car once and his apartment twice, decided they had probable cause to charge him on Tuesday in Graham's disappearance. 

The police chief refused to release details of the new information that had led to the charges and new arrest warrant but he said the search for the UVA student continues.

Chief Longo said: ‘We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah.’

A $50,000 reward has been posted for information relating to her disappearance. 

Authorities announced on Tuesday that they had taken clothing during the search. Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants declined to comment on the importance of the clothing or give any further details on what prompted the second search. 

As of Tuesday afternoon, the state lab was still analyzing evidence it has received from Charlottesville police, including nearly two dozen items and eight 'known samples that we would use for comparison purposes,' said Jeffrey Ban, director of the Department of Forensic Science's Central Laboratory in Richmond.

Ban said that the department has expedited the case and hoped to provide authorities with results in the 'very near future'. 

Matthew has been employed at the University of Virginia Medical Center since August 12, 2012, as a patient technician in the operating room, university spokesman McGregor McCance said.  

Matthew had a taxi permit from 2007 through 2010, according to Pam Goheen with Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.

His former boss, John Amato, told WVTF: 'He was a nice guy, always in a good mood, always easy to talk to. I never had any problem with him. He was always reliable to call. The customers really liked him, so I’d be very, very surprised if he were tied into this negatively in any way.'

Suspect Matthew was named by MailOnline as the black man with dreadlocks seen following Miss Graham and putting his arm around her as she walked through Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall at 1am on Saturday, September 13.

Witnesses later saw Matthew buying drinks for 18-year-old Hannah at the Tempo bar and the pair leaving together.

Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar, MailOnline revealed.

Chief Longo said Matthew was the last person to see the 18-year-old student before she ‘vanished off the face of the earth’.

MailOnline exclusively revealed how the UVA nursing assistant told family members he was not responsible for the 18-year-old’s disappearance and that the pair ‘went their separate ways’.

Matthew’s grandmother Christine Carr told MailOnline: ‘He told his mother he bought her some drinks. 

‘He said she did not get into his car. He said he went his way and she went hers.’

‘LJ would never hurt anybody,' Mrs Carr, 82, from Charlottesville, told MailOnline. 'I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life.' 

Matthew has been on the run since Saturday when police issued an arrest warrant for his arrest on two counts of reckless driving. 

Police released this footage in their search for a man in dreadlocks. He has now been revealed to be Jesse 'LJ' Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital. Police charged him with abduction on Tuesday

According to Charlottesville Police Chief Longo, Matthew walked into the police station with his mother and his uncle on Saturday but quickly left the station after asking to speak to a lawyer.

Police say he sped away afterward, losing officers who had him under surveillance and prompting authorities to issue two arrest warrants for reckless driving.   

Hannah's parents, John and Sue Graham, made an emotional appeal for their teenage daughter's safe return on Sunday during a press conference.

Mr Graham said: ‘As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah’s big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement.

‘Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James’s little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.'   

According to police, Graham met friends at a restaurant for dinner on September 12 before stopping by two parties at off-campus housing units. 

The sophomore, from northern Virginia, left the second party alone, police have said, and sent a text message to a friend saying she was lost.

Surveillance videos showed her walking, and at some points running, past a pub and a service station and then onto the Downtown Mall, a seven-block pedestrian strip lined with shops and restaurants where police believe she entered a bar with Matthew.

According to family members and police, Graham is an alpine skier and plays the alto saxophone. Organizers of a candlelight vigil last week at the university handed out her favorite candy, Starburst. 

Police Chief Longo said he learned from visiting with Graham's parents that the graduate of West Potomac High School earned straight A's six years in a row. 

The last footage of Hannah is from roughly 30 minutes before she called her friends to say she was lost
