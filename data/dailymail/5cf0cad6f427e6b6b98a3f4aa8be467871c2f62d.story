Rio Ferdinand was back in red and white on Christmas Eve as the veteran defender prepared for the hectic festive schedule. 

The 35-year-old has endured a frustrating spell since moving from Manchester United to Queens Park Rangers in the summer.

QPR defender Rio Ferdinand joined in the festive fun by dressing up as Father Christmas

 

Ferdinand is likely to be on the bench when QPR make the trip across London for the Premier League fixture against Arsenal on Boxing Day.

But he was in high spirits as he dressed up as 'Santa Ferdinand' and posted a video on Instagram to send seasonal greetings to fans.

Ferdinand said: 'Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas, enjoy the festivites, don't get too drunk. 

 

'Hope you give a lot and receive a lot.

'Its been a great year, enjoy it. I'm Santa Ferdinand for all my Instagam followers.'

Ferdinand obviously enjoys the festive fun as he tweeted a picture of him wearing the same outfit last Christmas.
