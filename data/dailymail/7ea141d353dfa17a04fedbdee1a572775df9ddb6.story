If the mere thought of re-painting the windows or front door of your home fills you with dread, spare a thought for airlines who have to spruce up their planes.

But for them time really can fly.

For with the help of time-lapse photography, airline Emirates has compressed into just two minutes the near fortnight-long round-the-clock marathon required to strip and re-paint each of its Boeing 777 passenger aircraft.

Emirates runs the world’s largest aircraft paint hangar owned by an airline.

Last year it completed 21 aircraft ‘make-overs’, each one averaging around 312 hours or about 13 days and nights.

The Emirates paint hangar at Dubai International Airport is more than twice the size of a football pitch. 

A Boeing 777 requires a team of 26 to 30 people for a full strip-and-repaint project, which is turned around in 12 to 13 days in the hangar which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Half-way: The plane has lost most of its paint by this point as the work continues around the clock

Bare: The Boeing 777 pictured completely denuded of its paint ready for a new coat

First steps: The white base layer is the first coat of paint to be applied to the plane

Temperature, humidity and airflow have to be regulated to ensure a perfect glossy coat.

Adel Al Redha, executive vice president and chief operations officer of Emirates, said: ‘It’s not just about looking good.

'The paint coat has to withstand fierce weather conditions, including severe wind, bitter cold and searing heat, and an exterior coat that is clean of debris and imperfections improves aerodynamics and reduces fuel consumption.

‘Emirates already flies a young and efficient fleet, but with fuel prices at consistently high levels, every little bit of efficiency counts.’

Stencil: Next the name of the airline is reapplied to the Boeing jet by workers

Nearly done: The painting crew put the finishing touches to the plane as they work on the door

Finally! After 13 days of work, the gleaming 777 is ready to go back into service

He added: ‘Our aircraft livery is one of
 the most recognisable and visible aspects of our brand. It is what 
people see in the sky, and the first thing our passengers see at their 
boarding gates.

‘We take pride in maintaining our aircraft to the highest possible standards, and it is important our planes look pristine on the outside as well as on the inside.’

The Dubai-based carrier strips its aircraft of their exterior colour and gives them a brand-new coat after every seven to eight years in service.

It has 132 Boeing 777s, one of which is featured in the video, with 201 more on order.
