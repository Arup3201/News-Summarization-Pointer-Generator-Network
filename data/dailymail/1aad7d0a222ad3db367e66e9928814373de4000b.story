It's not just Lindsey Vonn's red wellingtons making a splash at the President's Cup - a sneaky squirrel has stolen the show at Muirfield Village.

Sammy the squirrel has become the U.S. team's mascot after co-captain Davis Love III took a shining to him during a rain delay yesterday. 

And the furry critter has been doing the rounds, with Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn sneakily placing it on boyfriend Tiger Woods' shoulder in a funny prank.

Friendly: Tiger Woods warmed up to the idea of carrying a real squirrel on his neck during the Day One Four-Ball Matches at Muirfield Village Golf Club

Video footage captured the moment Vonn pulled the squirrel out of Love III's trouser pocket before surreptitiously placing it on 37-year-old Woods' neck.

Woods, who was focused on the golfers still on the green, initially brushed his shoulder until he realized what was sitting on him. 

The world number one appeared rattled at first, before smiling broadly, to the delight of his 28-year-old girlfriend.

Before heading to Minnesota today, Vonn tweeted to Love: 'Keep the squirrel happy until I get back tomorrow. :)'

Engrossed: Tiger Woods was so focused on the action, he didn't initially notice that girlfriend Lindsey Vonn put a squirrel on his arm

Vonn made quite an impression at the golf tournament yesterday.

Pairing her red boots with snug white denim jeans and a navy blue V-neck T-shirt, the snow siren was the center of attention on the green, but she pretended to not notice.

For hours she watched as her boyfriend of one year participated in the Four-Ball matches, which began 90 minutes late due to rain.

The gold medal winner said when she met Woods, who is divorced from Swedish beauty Elin Nordegren, they hit it off.

'We immediately clicked, you know? It was just one of those things,' she told Vogue in August. 

'Tiger's fame is obviously in the extreme, the amount of scrutiny that he's constantly under.

'But that's the thing: It all comes back to being happy. It doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks; do what you love to do and be happy and that's it.'
