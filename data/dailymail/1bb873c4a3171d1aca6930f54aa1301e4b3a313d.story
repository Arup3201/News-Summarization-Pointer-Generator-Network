A mother has hit out at school teachers for excluding her teenage son from classes over his Wayne Rooney-style haircut.

Billy Davies was told his hairstyle was too ‘extreme’ for the classroom because it is shaved into a ‘V’ shape at the back - similar to one previously sported by the Manchester United striker.

Teachers at Park Community School in Havant, Hampshire, decided to bar the 15-year-old from all of his lessons until his hair grows back.

'Extreme': Billy Davies' hairstyle was branded 'extreme' by teachers and he was told he could not join lessons because it breached uniform policy at Park Community School in, Havant

But furious Jackie Davies said: ‘The school is being pedantic. His hair isn’t extreme at all.

‘I could understand if he was going to school with purple or blue hair but that’s not the case.’

The teen, who lives with his parents in Havant, said: ‘It’s stupid because I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my hair.

‘It’s fashionable and a lot of my friends have the same sort of haircut, yet I’m the only one who has been punished.

‘Some of the students even have pink hair.

Style icons: Haircuts, like the ones sported by Chelsea's Raul Meireles, left, and Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, have been banned by the school

‘I
feel gutted because now I’m not in lessons with my friends and it’s 
going to be harder to concentrate on my work being sat alone.’

The youngster now has to do his work in a room by himself during lesson time.

If he needs any help then he has to go and ask a teacher before returning to the room once he has had assistance.

The schoolboy has had the haircut for a
year but letters were sent out by the school in September which warned 
parents it would not tolerate ‘extreme’ hairstyles.

Billy says he never got a copy of the letter and argues that his hairstyle is not ‘extreme’.

Excluded: Billy Davies does not see any problem with his hairstyle but has been banned him from lessons until it grows out

Last year, parents began a campaign to get regulations relaxed at the school after scores of pupils were banned from lessons.

They felt their children were being punished for spiking up their hair with gel and having it subtly coloured.

Headteacher Chris Anders said: ‘We’re an outstanding school and proud of our high standards.

‘Parents are well aware of the uniform policy and support it.

‘It’s
always a shame when students do not follow rules. But as adults working
with children and young people, we know it is important to be clear 
about the consequences of actions and to follow through when rules are 
broken.’
