A new gadget can turn your phone in a 'walkie talkie' - even if you have no phone coverage.

The goTenna uses radio waves to communicate over 50 miles.

If both people have a device, they can messages each other and send their location, complete with a map.

The $199 for two gadget contains a large antenna that creates a low power radio network. Using a special app users can message each other and share their location.

The device pairs wirelessly over BluetoothLE to the goTenna app (available on iOS and Android).

It then allows you to send and receive text messages and share GPS locations and maps via low-frequency radio-waves over relatively high range (up to 50 miles).

The goTenna app has automatic message retry and will let you know when your message has been delivered to the intended recipient.

It will last for 72 hours on a full charge, and has a standby time of 150 days.

The gadget also creates a 'mesh' network among users, allowing the range to be extended.

The firm says the gadget is perfect for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, and even for families who travel a lot - who can use it abroad without paying roaming charges.

'goTenna allows you to communicate privately, free of subscriptions or fees, and is designed to beas rugged and resilient as its users,' the firm said.

The idea came to Brooklyn brother and sister team Daniela and Jorge Perdomo during Hurricane Sandy when over a quarter of cell towers were downed. 

'Our mission is twofold: to let people communicate whenever and wherever they want, on their own terms, and also to make sure that in times of a true emergency, people are able to reach others around them,' said Daniela Perdomo, CEO of goTenna.

With goTenna, you can send messages to anyone within range of you who alsohas the device - which the firm says is key during an emergency.

The gadget can easily be attached to a backpack, allowing hikers to take it everywhere with them

'When you need to reach someone around you, simply send a 'shout' to another goTenna user,' it says.

'We’ve all been there: whether it’s during a hike, at a crowded concert, or traveling abroad, at times when we most need to stay connected to our group, we are faced with unreliable or unaffordable cell service.'

The device pairs wirelessly over BluetoothLE to the goTenna app (available on iOS and Android).

The app lets people send private messages to each other (left) and also set up group chats with friends to keep in touch - as long as they are within 50 miles of each other
