Accused killer Jodi Arias has sobbed in court as prosecutors showed the jury images of horrendous wounds she allegedly inflicted on her former boyfriend as she stabbed him to death in his shower.

The 32-year-old kept her head down and refused to look at the grisly images of Travis Alexander, whom she is accused of stabbing 27 times before slitting his throat and shooting him in the head.

She wiped away tears as the  Maricopa County 
medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death penalty.

If
she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a
'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona.

'Killer': She stands accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander to death at his home in 2008

Yet the medical examiner said he could 
not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the 
body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the 
killing.

With the delicate brain tissue also 
decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or 
how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander
was still alive.

The evidence was brought after an extended weekend break in Arias' murder trial. Prosecutor Juan Martinez  also displayed images from the scene at Alexander's Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008.

Some showed defensive slash wounds on
Alexander's hands, sustained when he tried to fight back, and grazes on
his legs, suggesting his body was later dragged.

'Obsessed': The couple only dated for five months before breaking up over jealous issues, she said

Prosecutors are expected to argue that Arias slit Alexander's throat in 
the hallway and then dragged his body back into the bathroom, ABC News reported.

Alexander's sisters, who were seated in 
the front row of the Phoenix courtroom, refused to look up at the images
throughout the testimony, keeping their heads bowed.

Arias has admitted to killing Alexander, whom she dated for five months in 2007, but claims it was out of self defense as he was controlling and possessive.

Yet the prosecution alleges she was a jealous girlfriend who became obsessed with Alexander after they broke up - even slashing his tires and hacking into his Facebook account.

Mess: Prosecutors said it appeared as if someone had tried to wipe the blood away after the murder

They claim she murdered him after becoming enraged that he wanted to start dating another woman.

The
pictures showing Alexander's wounds are just the latest pieces of bizarre evidence in 
the trial that
is already being compared to the dramatic 2010 murder trial of Casey 
Anthony.

Last week Martinez showed pictures of 
the bloody crime scene, with congealed blood seen on the toilet, floor, 
carpet and across walls.

Pictures showed blood-soaked clothes 
and towels that had been tossed in Alexander's washing machine, 
presumably in a failed attempt to remove the stains.

They
were found alongside Alexander's water-logged camera. Investigators 
found images on the camera showing the pair having sex on the day of the
murder and photos of Alexander posing nude in the shower moments before
we was murdered.

In a bizarre twist, the camera also contained images of Alexander after the murder and a picture of Arias dragging his body - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped.

Another image shows Arias in a 
t-shirt reading 'Travis Alexander's', which the defense has used to suggest his possessiveness.

Arias, a photographer7, has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder.

Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days.

Arias originally claimed she had not 
seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two 
men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense.

Possessive: The jury was shown a picture of Arias in a t-shirt Alexander made reading 'Travis Alexander's'

Jennifer Willmott, an attorney for 
Arias, told jurors her client acted in self-defense after Alexander 
'lunged at Jodi in anger' in his suburban Mesa home after she dropped 
his new camera.

'Jodi's
life was in danger. He knocked her to the ground in the bathroom where 
there was a struggle,' Willmott said. 'If she did not have to defend 
herself, she would not be here.'

Yet prosecutors argue Arias was a jealous woman who brutally attacked Alexander after he tried to end their relationship.

'This
is not a case of whodunit,' Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan 
Martinez said in his opening statement. 'The person who committed this 
killing sits in court today - Jodi Ann Arias.'

Alexander had told friends Arias had 
become too possessive and was acting like a stalker, so he ended their 
relationship to see other women. But phone and email records indicate 
the pair continued to carry on a sexual relationship.

Suspect: Travis Alexander's friend and roommate who found his body in June 2008 told a 911 dispatcher that Jodi Arias had been stalking and threatening the man

Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be 
baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.
