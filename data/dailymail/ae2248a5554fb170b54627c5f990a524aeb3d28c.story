One journalist bore the full brunt of former rugby league player John Hopoate outside court on Wednesday, when he allegedly tried to trip her, before swearing at her so ferociously sheriffs were forced to intervene.

At the Downing Centre in Sydney for his son Jamil's sentencing over the brutal bashing of a man in February, Hopoate senior was not pleased when he was approached outside court by reporters.

As the pack followed him along Liverpool Street in the CBD, the former NRL player stuck his foot out in a what appeared to be deliberate attempt to send 2UE radio journalist Leonie Ryan flying.

'It was while we were waiting outside after Jamil was sentenced,' Ms Ryan told Daily Mail Australia.

'He stomped on my foot and attempted to trip me over,' she continued.  

Footage from the incident shows the journalist walking alongside John asking the question: 'Do you have anything to say?'

John then sticks his right leg out to the side causing Ms Ryan to stumble, almost sending her flying into the pavement. 

Unfortunately for Ms Ryan, the confrontation was far from over, as the man continued to antagonise her further once court was about to resume.

Ms Ryan said she was trying to ask John a question before she says he tried to trip her over

Reporters went back inside to hear Jamil's bail application and just minutes later John launched a verbal attack.

'I could see him through the glass at court and he was glaring at me and mumbling,' Ms Ryan.

'(Then) he stormed in and I stood up, he just kept repeating "stop spreading lies, stop spreading lies":'

'He kept calling me a f****** b****,' Ms Ryan continued.

Former rugby league winger John Hopoate made international headlines when he was caught sticking his finger up the bottoms of three rival players while playing for the Wests Tigers in 2001.

He was suspended for 12 weeks for his action and earned global infamy, in what is considered one of Australia's biggest sporting scandals. 

The reporter told John his behaviour outside was completely inappropriate, while he continued to abuse her.

At this point the sheriffs pulled him up, said they had seen John threatening journalists outside the court and threatened to arrest him.

'I went up to the Sherrif and I said look, we need to go back into court because Jamil is about to lodge a bail application ... what can be done,' Ms Ryan said.

'By this point I was shaking, I was really angry and intimidated'.

Despite warnings from the sheriffs who notified John's lawyers, he continued to threaten Ms Ryan when she got out of the elevator upstairs outside the court room.

'He was sitting there when the elevator doors opened and sitting there just whispering you f****** b**** you f****** b****, you're a f****** b****.'

Due to the confrontation, a male journalist had to relieve Ms Ryan of her court duties, over concerns for her safety.

'Jamil is up for an appeal in February and I definitely wont' be covering that,' she said.
