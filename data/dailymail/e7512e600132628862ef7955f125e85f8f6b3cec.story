In times past, they would have carried greetings of goodwill amid peaceful Yuletide scenes.

But the Christmas cards of today are just as likely to sport obscene, offensive or even anti-Christian messages.

The main offender is the stationery chain Scribbler which stocks the explicit cards in full view of children.

Shoppers using the firm’s website are also offered a range of the festive cards carrying four-letter expletives and images of sex acts.

Offensive: Two of the Scribbler cards with the profanities obscured 

One carries the slogan: ‘Ho Ho Ho Mother F*****’; a second features Father Christmas under the slogan ‘Merry Kiss My A**’; a third says on the front: ‘This Christmas Treat Yourself to some A***’.

Others mock Jesus, putting him in what seems to be a ‘selfie’ pose with the slogan: ‘It’s all about me’. Another showing Jesus with his disciples says: ‘It’s my birthday and I want a pony’. Family and Christian campaigners said the cards were an insult.

The Christmas cards of today sport obscene and offensive messages 

The cards featuring explicit messages are stocked within full view of children in High Street stores

Childs Eyes UK, which campaigns against sexual and violent images, says it is 'not appropriate' for children to see cards using this language 

Norman Wells of the Family Education Trust said: ‘Crude and offensive greetings cards have no place in high street stores.

‘Parents should be able to shop with their children without being confronted by products that are calculated to cause embarrassment or offence.

‘Some of the cards reflect a deep-seated prejudice against Christianity. It is hard to imagine such blasphemous and sacrilegious sentiments being tolerated if they were targeted at any other religion.’

Kathy McGuinness, of Childs Eyes UK, which campaigns against sexual and violent images, said: ‘Our concern is for what children see, but a lot of adults and Christians would find these cards and images offensive.

‘It is not appropriate for children, if you look at the language the firm is using. We have a broadcasting watershed on TV.

‘We have to be very careful about making jokes about other religions, but when it comes to Christianity it seems to be open season.’

Andrea Minichiello Williams of Christian Concern said: ‘Let’s hope that people vote with their pocket and that Scribbler gets left with stockpiles of cards that it can’t sell.’

John Proctor, who owns the Scribbler chain, defended the card displays, saying they appealed to younger adult customers.

‘It is all a question of one’s own standards and viewpoint,’ he said. ‘There should be humour in religion. I know our local vicar finds a lot of the cards that we sell are amusing. I don’t think the fact that someone has a particular religious inclination, feeling or faith should preclude humour.’

'Parents should be able to shop with their children without being confronted by these products, ' said Normans Wells of the Family Education Trust

Christian Concern has said they hope people'vote with their feet' and leave stores with stockpiles of cards

John Proctor, who owns Scribbler, defended the displays and said the cards were popular with young adults 

Asked, if he would treat the Muslim faith and its icons in the same way, Mr Proctor said: ‘No, we wouldn’t. I would feel there is less humour in those religions. I wouldn’t even go there. I have no understanding of that faith and feel I am stepping completely out of my comfort zone. That would be a really silly thing to be doing.’

Mr Proctor, who founded Scribbler with wife Jennie in 1981, said the chain put the explicit cards on higher shelves.

But a snapshot of stores in London yesterday found the offensive cards were on lower shelves with warning signs hard to spot.

The Proctors have a £1.5million thatched home in Dorset and a luxury central London address for the weekdays they spend working.

They have three grown-up children, enjoy a succession of exotic holidays and ferry themselves around by Porsche, Jeep, and even a powerboat. The chain has 29 stores nationwide.
