It has earned a reputation as Britain's most debauched student pub crawl - and this year's Carnage UK event in Cardiff certainly lived up to its notoriety.

The theme for this year's night of revelry was 'Pimps and Hoes', and saw the university's undergraduate girls take to the streets dressed in little more than their underwear, covered by the official pub crawl T-shirt.

Hundreds of first-year students turned out in Cardiff city centre to participate in the first such event of the year and were captured on camera unashamedly stumbling around, and behaving drunk and disorderly.

And as the evening drew to a close 
couples perhaps unknown to each other hours earlier were seen in 
passionate clinches, while in shop doorways some students could be seen 
slumped in a drunken stupor.

The Carnage UK organisers have 
repeatedly come under fire for hosting the events, which promote 
excessive binge drinking as students are encouraged to go from one bar to
 the next to consume copious amounts of beverage.

Andrew Misell, manager of Alcohol Concern Cymru said: 'Companies who organise events like this must take their 
responsibilities seriously. Too often young people take part, drink far 
too much and end up in a vulnerable state on the street with society 
left to pick up the pieces.

'We know that alcohol is part of many people’s social lives but we need 
to learn how to enjoy it sensibly and safely, and events like Carnage 
don’t help.

'For a young person it may seem like one, fun-filled night out but there 
can be grave and far reaching consequences because of their excessive 
drinking.'

Scantily 
clad female students wore little other than bras and mini skirts with 
suspenders as they adhered to the fancy dress code of a prostitute.

Male students wore ripped open 
T-shirts and shorts and were pictured passionately kissing girls nearly 
bearing all on street corners.

Some students didn't even manage to make it home before slumping on the pavement and falling asleep.

The pub crawl on Sunday night saw female students also donning basques, fishnet tights and high waisted shorts.

One
 snap captures a hysterical shoeless girl struggling with a bouncer as 
her top is pulled across her body, exposing her bra entirely.

Other pictures show youngsters walking with traffic cones on their heads and others receiving a ticking-off from police.

Students appear to have no quarms sitting on the pavement to eat their takeaway.

Nor do they seem to care being pictured behaving drunk and disorderly.

Carnage UK is staging events in 44 
university town and cities over the next two months to welcome this 
year’s intake of freshers.

But the organisers have been criticised in the past for encouraging binge drinking and anti-social behaviour.

Pete Mercer, NUS Vice-President for Welfare told MailOnline: 'NUS has long been critical of organised bar crawls that promote excessive drinking and put the participants’ health at risk.

'We have established a successful partnership with Drinkaware to promote safer drinking practices amongst young people and will continue to do so.

'It takes a staggering lack of imagination on behalf of the organisers to assume that students are only interested in getting drunk; with a little thought they could put on activities that didn’t promote such a lazy stereotype of young people.'

In 2009, 19-year-old student Philip Laing desecrated a poppy wreath in Sheffield and was later ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service and pay £185 cost after admitting outraging public decency.

Following a Carnage event held in 
2009, police said they were looking into the possibility of charging the
 organisers for the cost of the extra police needed to be drafted in to 
man the streets.

Police in Exeter claimed the event cost them thousands of pounds.

In
 2010 a court heard how a carnage pub crawl operator punched unconscious
 a resident who voiced concerns about noise levels at one of their 
events.

Ryan Hilton, 23, was
 accused of assaulting 61-year-old Mark Roberts during a late night 
incident in Bangor, North Wales, on March 3 last year.

Siobhan McCann, from alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Organising events centred on binge drinking or drinking to get drunk is irresponsible and should not be encouraged.'
