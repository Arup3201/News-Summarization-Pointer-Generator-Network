Rolf Harris was last night cut off by Lenny Henry as he performed a singalong of Two Little Boys alone at the Diamond Jubilee Concert.

The Australian personality, 82, wearing a Union Flag shirt he painted himself, was stopped by the comedian as he got to the end of his rendition so he could introduce Stevie Wonder.

But Rolf Harris continued with his performance and finished the final line as the crowd booed Lenny Henry.

Aussie tribute: Rolf Harris, wearing a Union flag shirt, leads a singalong of Two Little Boys Alone outside Buckingham Palace last night

On an unforgettable night at the Palace,
even Princess Anne was spotted singing along with the crowd during the solo rendition.

Rolf Harris paid a heartfelt tribute to the Queen and said 'she's looking better than I am'.

Lenny Henry's attempts to interrupt the entertainer were today compared with ITV's decision to cut off Brit 
Award winner Adele during her acceptance speech.

Piers Morgan Tweeted last night that he was 'furious' that the Aussie had been cut off.

He wrote: 'Still seething about Lenny Henry wrecking Rolf's big moment like that - who the hell does he think he is?'

Twitter user Caffy wrote: 'Lenny Henry, how dare you interrupt Rolf Harris!?'

As Rolf got to the end, Lenny Henry interrupted and said: 'You have got to stop because they are ready, I can only apologise.'

Rolf
responded: 'I thought you wanted me to sing.'

Earlier the Aussie star had paid a touching tribute to the Monarch as she marked 60 years on the throne without her husband Prince Philip at her side.

The Aussie told the crowd he moved to England when he was 22, just as the Queen was coming to the throne.

Gesturing to his patriotic shirt as he came onto the stage, he told the crowd: 'G'day - do you like the shirt? I painted it the other night.'

He added: 'What an absolute pleasure for me to be 
here. I'm absolutely thrilled. I moved to England 60 years ago so my time
here has completely overlapped the Queen's reign. I think she's looking
better than me, by the way.

Rolf Harris
recalled painting a portrait of the Queen in 2005 and said it was the best moment of his six-decade career in Britain.

'I had the privilege of meeting Her Majesty several times and recently painted her portrait and I have got to tell you it has been the highlight of my career,' he added.

Addressing the crowd, he said later: 
'We are here to celebrate a generous and compassionate lady who has 
given 60 years of service to the people of Great Britain and the 
Commonwealth.

'She has been
an inspiration to millions. She has touched hearts throughout the 
world. A living testimony to the power of kindness, dedication, 
tolerance and loyalty. A lady who has upheld the best of British by 
keeping calm and carrying on.

'Your Majesty we thank you for 60 
wonderful years, and we hope that you are enjoying this spectacular 
achievement and we wish you a very happy and healthy long reign.

'From the heart we hope that today has been a beautiful day.'

As Her Majesty had taken her place in the royal box, there were ripples of 'Bless her' as she waved to the arena.

Presenter Lenny Henry told the audience to turn to the royal box 'and say with one voice, you just missed Tom Jones'.

The first act the Queen caught was a return for Robbie Williams in a dinner suit performing Mack The Knife and changing the lyrics to include a reference to the royal box and Eugenie.

The three-hour concert last night, organised by Williams's Take That bandmate Gary Barlow was staged to celebrate music from throughout the Queen's 60-year reign.

Robbie Williams raised the curtain at the spectacular concert before the Queen's arrival as he was accompanied by a military band for his signature tune Let Me Entertain You.

The star danced around the Corps of Drums of the Massed Bands of the Household Division to perform the song in a cloud of pyrotechnic smoke in front of Buckingham Palace.

Thousands of people in the Mall and in a specially-built arena turned the area into a flurry of red, white and blue as they waved flags furiously.

In keeping with the Queen's lengthy 
reign, Sir Cliff Richard drew on hits from across each decade of his 
career - which stretches back to 1958.

Cheryl Cole made a surprise appearance to accompany Barlow on his first appearance of the night.

The former X Factor judge - 
accompanying a current panellist from the show - looked elegant in a 
frothy black and white floor-length gown to perform her single Need You 
Now.

Earlier, JLS performed hits Everybody In Love and She Makes Me Wanna, although they failed to keep the crowd on their feet.

My proudest moment: Rolf Harris with his portrait of the Queen which he last night described as the 'highlight' of his career. It was unveiled in 2005
