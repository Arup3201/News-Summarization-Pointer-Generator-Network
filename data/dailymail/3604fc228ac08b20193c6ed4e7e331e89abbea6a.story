The family of teenager Madeleine Pulver, who was at the centre of the 'fake bomb' drama last week, has been told that an arrest is imminent.

Detectives have identified a suspect after 18-year-old Miss Pulver told them that the man who attached the collar bomb to her at her home in Sydney, Australia, had 'old wrinkly eyes'.

The suspect has already been spoken to by detectives from Strike Force Haddon, but has yet to be formally interviewed, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported today.

Madeleine is said to have described her attacker as having wrinkly eyes that she could see peering through the balaclava he wore when he broke into her home in the harbourside Sydney suburb of Mosman.

'Our most important goal is to solve this case as quickly as possible and protect the interests of the victim,' a police spokesman said.

The paper said the development in the police investigation is the reason no description has been issued publicly following the drama, which made international headlines.

A police source said it had not been necessary to seek public help in identifying the offender because investigators had identified the person they believed responsible soon after the incident.

Miss Pulver's father, Mr Bill Pulver,
a wealthy IT businessman, and his family have been told that police 
were making headway with the investigation and an arrest was expected 
imminently.

The family has also been told that there is no need for 'ongoing fear or concern'.

Despite
reports earlier this week that the family had been told to employ a 
security guard in case of a further attack, a source close to the family
said that was untrue.

Police have refused to comment when asked whether the suspect was an older man with wrinkly eyes.

It took officers ten hours to remove the device from Miss Pulver's neck and discover it was a fake.

Multiple
fingerprints have been found on the sophisticated bomb-like device that
was strapped to Miss Pulver's neck and on a USB stick inside the 
square-shaped box.
