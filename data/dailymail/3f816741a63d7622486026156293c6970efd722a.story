Despite a £3 million taxpayer-funded campaign telling people to stay in Britain for their holidays, Government ministers and MPs led by David Cameron will be doing the opposite this summer.

Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Philip Hammond are also Europe-bound for their break from Westminster, in direct contrast to the official 'Holidays at Home are Great' film involving some of the UK's biggest stars that came out five months ago.

Launched in March, the adverts, which 
featured Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, Harry Potter's Rupert Grint, 
as well as British icons Stephen Fry and Julie Walters, were hoped to harness the power of the Olympics and Diamond 
Jubilee and inspire Britons to holiday in the UK.

And while millions are taking the advice, many in Westminster are not doing the same, heading for the sun after the Olympics are finished.

Shadow Culture Secretary Harriet Harman is already away in France with her family, despite her counterpart Jeremy Hunt staying here for the entirety of the Games.

One of Ms Harman's aides told the Times today that Dame Tessa Jowell is Labour's representative at London 2012, not her, so her absence was not remarkable.

Ed Miliband will also be taking his wife and two children for a two-week break in Greece.

Meanwhile Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will be going to the Spanish town of Olmedo to visit his wife Miriam's family and then on to his villa in France. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is also off for a short break in Spain.

Magic touch: Harry Potter star Rupert Grint surfed at Bridlington beach in Yorkshire for the advert, but the message didn't work on some MPs

And despite saying only last month that 'if you want a holiday then why not have one here,' David Cameron will also take his wife Samantha and their three children to a currently secret European location.

But the Prime Minister will take some time off first in Cornwall, sources close to him have said.

Last year the Camerons were in Tuscany for their hols.

It appears Justice Secretary Ken Clarke 
is actually having a true staycation, as he will be spending his holiday
at home in Nottinghamshire.

Across the Channel French President Francois Hollande is
leading by example by taking a 'frugal' summer holiday on his country's
Mediterranean coast.

Shunning
foreign climes, as he had instructed his ministers to also do, the 
57-year-old self-styled Mr Normal soaked up the sun in Hyeres, close to 
his official presidential retreat Bregancon Fort.

Julie Walters: 'This it the Tate Liverpool there is no Tate Algarve I'm afraid'

Jeremy Hunt was the Minister who launched the 'Holidays at Home are Great' campaign in March.

The adverts 
feature the four celebrities encouraging Britons to explore UK 
destinations and ends with the line, 'No passports. No jabs. No visas. 
No Euros. No wonder holidays at home are so great.'

The
Government hoped the initiative - led by VisitEngland with the support 
of the tourist boards of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - would 
discourage British holidaymakers from travelling abroad during a Jubillee and 
Olympic year.

Defending its £3 million cost, Mr Hunt said: 'As an industry and as a Government, we will know whether this type of campaign works and what the return on investment is.'
