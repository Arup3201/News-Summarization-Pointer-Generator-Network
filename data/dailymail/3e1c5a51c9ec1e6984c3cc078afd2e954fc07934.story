A cat has made an extraordinary journey of almost 2,000 miles after she went missing from Colorado five years ago and turned up in New York.

Willow disappeared from a home in Broomfield but was found on Wednesday in Manhattan and will soon be reunited with her owners.

Jamie and Chris Squires, of Boulder, Colorado, were ‘shocked’ to hear of her whereabouts, but she had a microchip implanted as a kitten.

Eyes have it: How Willow got to New York, which is more than 1,600 miles away, and the kind of life she lived in the city are both mysteries

The family, who live near the Rocky Mountains, have two of three kids and one of two dogs who may still remember Willow.

But how she got to New York, which is more than 1,600 miles away, and the kind of life she lived in the city are both mysteries.

‘To be honest, there are tons of coyotes around here, and owls,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘She was just a little thing, five and a half pounds.

‘We put out the “Lost Cat” posters and the Craigslist thing, but we actually thought she'd been eaten by coyotes.’

Long trip: Willow disappeared from a home in Colorado, but was found on Wednesday in New York City and will soon be reunited with her owners

The couple were ‘astounded’ when they 
got a call from Animal Care & Control in New York City, saying she 
had been found on East 20th Street.

Mrs
Squires added that her husband told her not to tell their children 
until they were sure it was indeed Willow that had been found.

‘Then we saw the picture, and it was Willow,’ she said. ‘It's been so long.’

Animal Care & Control Executive Director Julie Bank said a scanner found the microchip that led to the Squires family.

Found: Jamie Squires said Willow escaped in late 2006 or early 2007 when contractors left a door open during a home renovation

‘All our pets are microchipped,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘If I could microchip my kids, I would.’

The
children are aged 17, 10 and 3 - so the older two remember Willow. Mrs 
Squires said her 3-year-old saw a photo and remarked: 'She's a pretty cat.’

The Squires family also have a yellow labrador named Roscoe, who knew Willow, and an English mastiff named Zoe.

‘We
had another dog back then too, and I remember Willow would lie with 
them as they all waited to be fed,’ she said. 'She thought she was a 
dog.'

Mrs Squires said Willow escaped in late 2006 or early 2007 when contractors left a door open during a home renovation.

Jamie Squires was worried about a possible New York state of mind.

'I
don't know what kind of life she's had, so I don't know what her 
personality will be like,’ she said.

She described Willow when she 
disappeared as ‘a really cool cat, really sweet’.

Since then the family had moved about 
10 miles from Broomfield to Boulder, but kept its address current with 
the microchip company.

Ms Bank recommended that all pet owners use microchips.

She
said Willow, who now weighs 7lbs, is healthy and well-mannered and 
probably has not spent her life on the mean streets of Manhattan.

But there are no clues about her trip east or anything else in the five years she's been missing.

The ACC and the Squires family were trying to arrange for transportation back to Colorado and health certificates.

They said it might be two weeks before the reunion. Willow may spend some time with a foster family in New York.

‘The kids can't wait to see her,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘And we still have her little Christmas stocking.’
