Crackdown: George Osborne spoke with finance ministers from the G20 group about cracking down on firms not paying corporate tax

Public outrage over corporate tax avoidance must be used as a 'catalyst for change' in the UK and the developing world, Chancellor George Osborne said.

Mr Osborne was in Moscow yesterday for a meeting of finance ministers from the G20 group of major economies which pledged to find ways to crack down on dodges by multinationals.

Britain, France and Germany are spearheading a push for international agreement on measures to end practices such as 'transfer pricing' where profits are diverted to low-tax countries.

It follows claims of immoral behaviour by number of high-profile firms who have paid little or no corporation tax in the UK by exploiting legal loopholes.

But there have also been claims that UK firms are guilty of depriving poor countries of tax revenues as well - something the Chancellor said the UK would use its presidency of the G8 on which to push action.

Writing in the Observer, he said: 'This year, we have an opportunity to turn concern over tax avoidance into a catalyst for change, creating a competitive tax system that supports businesses, but where everyone pays their fair share. 

'Through our role in the G20 and our leadership of the G8, we can ensure this change benefits Britain's taxpayers and also helps meet our commitments to the poorest in our society.'

Mr Osborne defended the Government's decision to protect foreign aid spending from deep public spending cuts so next year it could meet a United Nations target to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas development.

Apart from saving lives and boosting education, it would be used to strengthen countries' abilities to enforce tax rules, he said.

Anger: Web giant Google avoided paying $2billion in tax last year by moving around 80 per cent of its overseas profits to a company in the tax haven of Bermuda

Starbucks has more than 700 outlets in the UK generating revenues of more than £3billion but it paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK and nothing in the last three

'Since we came into office, tax collection in Ethiopia has increased by 40 per cent. This is just one example - we are also involved in projects in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania.

Embarrassing: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Britain's economy had flatlined over two years which wasn't good enough

'We will champion a new agenda of transparency and accountability in developing countries.

'With the authority that comes from meeting our international commitments on aid, Britain is well placed to tackle the causes, not just the symptoms of poverty, such as corruption and lack of transparency.' 

Labour said House of Commons library figures showed the UK was in the G20 'relegation zone' in terms of economic growth since the Chancellor's autumn 2010 spending review.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'These are embarrassing figures for George Osborne as he attends the meeting of G20 countries this weekend. 

'Britain has now flatlined for over two and a half years under this Conservative-led government.'In the global growth league table we're in the relegation zone with 17 out of 20 countries including America, France and Germany doing better than us.

'This isn't good enough. The longer our economy stagnates the worse off people will be and the more long-term damage will be done.

'We need urgent action now to kick-start our flatlining economy and help people struggling with the rising cost of living. Our jobs plan includes building thousands of affordable homes and giving tax breaks to small firms taking on extra workers.'
