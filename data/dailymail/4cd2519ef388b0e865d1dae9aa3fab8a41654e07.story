Accusations: Anastasia Volochkova, 37, claimed that female dancers were forced to have sex with wealthy men or face losing their jobs at the theatre

Its standing as one of the world's most famous theatres has been overshadowed by the recent acid attack on its artistic director amid stories of vicious infighting.

But Russia's Bolshoi Ballet has suffered another blow to its reputation, as a former prima ballerina claimed that its director general had turned it into a 'giant brothel'.

Anastasia Volochkova claimed that female dancers were forced to have sex with wealthy men or face losing their jobs at the theatre.

Miss Volochkova, 37, who was fired from the Moscow theatre for being 'too fat', said: 'Unfortunately, the Bolshoi general director has turned the Bolshoi theatre into a giant brothel.

'It mainly happened with the corps du ballet but also with the soloists,' she claimed in a talkshow on Sunday, later repeating the claims in a radio interview

She added: 'Ten years ago when I was dancing at the 
theatre, I repeatedly received propositions to share the beds of 
oligarchs.

'The girls were forced to go along to grand dinners and given 
advance warning that afterwards they would be expected to have sex.

'When
the girls asked: 'What happens if we refuse?', they were told that they
would not go on tour or even perform at the Bolshoi theatre. Can you 
imagine?'

The 236-year-old theatre's general director Anatoly Iksanov rubbished the allegations, describing the claims as 'dirt and ravings'.

Miss Volochkova won a legal case against the Bolshoi after being fired in 2003, having become a prima ballerina in 1998.

After her dancing career came to an end, she became a prominent  television personality and even tried entering the world of politics.

Claims: Miss Volochkova who was sacked from the Moscow theatre in 2003 said ballerinas were forced to sleep with oligarchs in a television interview

The former star's claims will add to growing tensions within the theatre, following an attack on artistic director Sergei Filin in January.

Mr Filin was left with third degree burns and was nearly blinded when acid was thrown on his face outside his home by a masked man.

Top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has been charged with masterminding the acid attack.

He has admitted in court that he ordered a physical attack on Mr Filin but denies that he had any involvement in the acid attack.

Sacked: The dancer, who was made prima ballerina in 1998, was sacked in 2003 for being 'too fat' and later won a  lawsuit against the company

Attacked: Sergei Filin dries his eyes during the press conference at the university hospital in Aachen, Germany, as he speaks about his determination to return to the Bolshoi when his sight returns

An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to attack Mr Filin.

But a group of hundreds of dancers from the theatre has suggested that lead soloist Mr Dmitrichenko was set up in an open letter to President Vladimir Putin, in which they also protest his innocence.

The saga has gripped the Russian public with a constant stream of revelations and accusations by those involved or linked to the incident.

It recently emerged that Mr Filin was displaced as Mr Dmitrichenkoas as the company's trade union head.

At a press conference last week, Mr Filin said he would return to work as soon as he had recovered, despite suggestions from some that the attack had been organised by a more senior member of the theatre.

Confession: Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko, pictured in court last week, has admitted to 'giving his blessing' to a physical attack on Filin but not that the perpetrator would use acid
