Retaliation: Comedian Jon Stewart takes to the Daily Show to claim that the Fox News interview was edited so he appeared 'emotional and erratic'

Comic: Stewart played part of the clip that was edited from the show and parodied the station over its political views

But speaking on his own Comedy Central show on Monday evening, Stewart said that the show's producers had tampered with the interview. He said that he came across as 'emotional and erratic'.

'I suggest you look at the unedited version online where my emotional states don't seem to change so arbitrarily,' he said.

'The arguments are a little clearer and a little less like a scene from woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

'The unedited version which is on the web had what I thought was the takeaway moment of the entire interview where Chris Wallace, one of the more respected individuals at Fox, basically gives away the game.'

A clip of the unedited interview then showed Stewart asking Wallace if he thought that Fox News was the ideological equivalent of NBC News.

'I believe that we're the counterweight,' Wallace responded in the unedited version of the show.

'I think that they have a liberal agenda and I think we the the other side of the story.'

Confession: An unedited clip of the interview appears to show host Chris Wallace admitting Stewart's claim that the station is ideologically driven

Stewart flew from New York to Washington to record the Fox show. The conversation started jovially, with Mr Wallace joking to Stewart: 'After months of evasion, disconnected phone numbers and press agents saying 'who are you again' it appears he has run out of excuses.'

There were even jokes about the sparring partners drinking from two Fox News branded mugs, with Mr Stewart suggesting the water may in fact be poisoned.

But the atmosphere quickly turned serious as Mr Stewart, angered by questions over his own 'liberal' bias, snapped.

The audience were shown a transcript of Mr Stewart describing Fox News as a, 'relentless agenda-driven 24 hour news opinion propaganda delivery system.'

Mr Stewart later erupted: 'You're insane... Here's the difference between you and I.

'I'm a comedian first. My comedy is informed by an ideological background, there's no question about that.'

Stewart began his own show on Monday evening by telling viewers that he had been to the nation's capital and taken another 'classic' picture of himself. Viewers were then showed a picture of him posing crudely in front of the Washington Monument.

But he moved quickly onto attacking Fox News over the previous evening's interview. After playing the part of the interview where Wallace apparently admits Fox News has a right-wing bias, Stewart then parodies the station.

'The other side of the story. ''We don't tell both sides of the story, we tell one side...the other side, the one we perceive is never told. Because as you know, news only comes in two sides. And if the conservative side isn't being told what's being told must be liberal.

'' Fox News isn't fair and balanced. It's balancing the system, man. Don't you get it? The system's unfair and unbalanced. To balance the system, Fox has to be the purest form of right wing resin. Because of how heavy left wing America is. Hollywood, comedians, every single news organization, the Internet, facts, history, science, it's all just left wing bullshit, man....''

'Is Fox unbalanced? Yeah. Seriously, their ears are nearly touching the floor. But it's only because the system is unbalanced.' Stewart then pretends that his head is exploding.
