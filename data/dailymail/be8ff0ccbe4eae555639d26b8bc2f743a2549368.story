Lewis Hamilton's bid for victory at the British Grand Prix suffered a setback on Friday after he stopped on track during practice.

The Mercedes star, 29 points adrift of Nico Rosberg in the fight for the Formula One title, posted the fastest time of the day with a quickest lap of 1min 34.508secs, some two tenths clear of Rosberg.

But Hamilton's afternoon was cut short after he came to a halt at turn four with an oil-pressure problem with 30 minutes of the session remaining. It meant Hamilton completed 14 laps, crucially 21 fewer than his rival Rosberg.

Hamilton said: 'The car felt pretty good here but unfortunately I lost my most important run of the day this afternoon when I stopped out on track with an engine problem.

'We will 
change my programme around tomorrow morning to try and recover the time 
that I lost and make sure that I can complete my race preparation with a
 long run. It's not ideal but we'll recover.'

Rosberg meanwhile was dealt a boost in his title ambitions after he escaped punishment for passing Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso under red flags following Felipe Massa's huge shunt in the opening session.

The German was called to see the stewards, but they opted to take no further action.

The stewards stated in their decision that Kvyat's speed had dropped to just 24mph which contributed to their ruling.

'Having reviewed data from several cars in the same area of the track, several angles of video and having spoken to the driver concerned, the stewards determined that: the driver of car 6 had driven the lap fully within the regulations and was travelling at a safe and reasonable speed throughout,' an FIA statement read.

'At the moment of the overtake, car 26 pulled fully off line and slowed to as low as 38kph in what appeared to be a very unusual manner, in an area of the track that was visibly completely clear; and that the driver of car 6 took reasonable avoiding action of a car.

'The stewards accept he reasonably believed to be in difficulty, consistent with Art. 40.8(h) of the Sporting Regulations relating to Safety Car periods, whereby a pass is allowed in what has to be considered an acceptable circumstance; that the driver of car 6 slowed down to as low as 39kph immediately having passed car 26, reasonably reacting to the situation and continued to proceed with extreme caution.'

McLaren's Jenson Button was handed a three-place grid penalty for a similar incident at last year's United States Grand Prix, but the race stewards, including 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, deemed the telemetry cleared the championship leader of any wrong-doing.

It is the third time this year that Rosberg has escaped punishment following an investigation by the stewards.

He was cleared in Monaco after running off the track during qualifying and thus thwarting Hamilton's best shot at pole position. And at last month's Canadian Grand Prix, he escaped any action from the stewards despite cutting the final chicane en route to posting the fastest lap of the race.

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was the best of the rest, more than a quarter-of-a-second slower than Hamilton and behind the Mercedes pair. Daniel Ricciardo in fourth, was quicker than Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel once more.

Valtteri Bottas saw his engine cover dramatically explode to add to Williams' woes. Earlier, Susie Wolff, on her full Formula One debut, completed just four laps in the opening practice session, before she stopped with an oil-pressure problem while Massa wrecked his Williams.

The Brazilian took part in the afternoon session but was over two seconds slower than Rosberg.

Elsewhere, Jean-Eric Vergne suffered a wheel failure and was forced to retire from the session with 13 minutes remaining after his front-left tyre worked loose.
