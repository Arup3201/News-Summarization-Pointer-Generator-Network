These are the first behind-the-scenes pictures of Morph being re-created 37 years on - as the animated star returns to our screens tomorrow.

Animators at Aardman Animations in Bristol have spent five months creating 15 episodes using 150 clay models.

Remarkably, the team have used the original ‘Morph scales’ which ensure each model contains exactly 162g of clay to create the perfect figurine.

These are brand new photos taken during the production of the new Morph series to be released tomorrow

The new episodes of Morph went into production after a kickstarter campaign raised more than £110,000

The first episode of the new series will air on Morph’s YouTube channel at 5.15pm tomorrow - the exact time the character first appeared on BBC1 on February 15, 1977.

In truly modern fashion, the comeback was made possible by a crowdfunding campaign which raised £110,000 from 2,500 fans in a month to fund the new animations.

Morph was first created in 1977 at the hands of Peter Lord, and was famed for its clever use of plasticine stop motion animation.

This method involved moving the model in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the appearance of movement when the frames were played back-to-back at high speed.

Morph first hit TV screens in 1977 and appeared in one minute 'shorts' interspersed throughout children's TV shows presented by Tony Hart.

The character was known for living in a box, and was later joined by a white-coloured friend called Chas, allowing the two to interact.

They often changed shape completely, and could be rolled, squished or bent into various shapes.

While the original show was axed in 1997, there were several small Morph scenes created over following years before Mr Lord's recent kickstarter campaign funded a whole new series.

Mr Lord and the creators also went on to find fame for their Academy Award winning Wallace and Gromit films and TV series.

The series has been produced using 
the same traditional animation techniques used in the original series, 
which was axed in 1997.

The films were shot in the same studio as the original programmes with the same painstaking stop-frame animation and hand sculpting tools.

Co-founder of Aardman, Peter Lord: 'Morph is one of the first characters we created and we all love him at Aardman!

'I’m
 amazed and humbled that even though it has been close to 40 years since
 his creation, the little guy still has such a passionate following, 
especially on Facebook and YouTube.

'We’ve
 had so many people over the years asking for him to make a comeback and
 it’s been hugely exciting to work with his fans to bring Morph back in 
some brand new short films which we will release online for everyone to 
enjoy.'

As
 well as Morph’s new episodes, the character will also be used to 
introduce the programme ‘See Hear’, a show created with deaf or visibly
 impaired children in mind.

There
 was an issue as to whether Morph was up to the task, as although he has
 a thumb, his fingers are merged together, limiting the amount he can 
sign.

Luckily he can sign 'Hello and welcome to See Hear', so will introduce the show on Wednesday 18th June on BBC 2.
