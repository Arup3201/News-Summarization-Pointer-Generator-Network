As fare dodgers go, this middle-aged man in Ukraine has got to be one of the worst.

Rather than pay for a train ticket, Zossima Sozonov decided to jump over the barriers at Klovsk station, in the country's east, instead.

But despite the turnstile being little more than a foot off the ground he still managed to slip and knock himself unconscious.

CCTV of the accident shows Sozonov falling head over heels and on to the tiled floor, before a passerby helps him up.

The embarrassing tumble left him with a fractured skull and blood streaming down his face, and worse still,  it happened right in front of a ticket inspector who booked him.

Station security staff watched the whole incident, recorded it, and then released the video footage as a warning to others.

Kiev metro operator spokesman Leo Aksakov said: 'We don't make the barriers very high because we hope that people will respect the need to pay for the service, and it's more of a symbolic gesture just to remind people more than anything else. 

'But it seems that even a symbolic gesture was too much for this man, who we hope will think twice before attempting to avoid buying a ticket, and serve as a warning to others.'

He said the video had been shot at the Klovsk metro station and that the man had been unconscious for 10 seconds after he had tried to jump through the barriers.
