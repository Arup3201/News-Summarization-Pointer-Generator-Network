Close your eyes and imagine the numbers one to nine on a line.

Most people will see a horizontal line, with one on the left, and an orderly progression to nine on the right – a tendency known as the 'mental number line.'

But the preference for counting from left to right isn't just a human trait - it's also shared by newborn chicks.

Chicks count from left to right just like humans do, according to researchers at the University of Padova

The University of Padova in Italy wanted to see if the number line develops with cultural experience or if it is an innate behaviour.

Their findings suggest it is innate, with chicks appearing to use the line when presented with two different panels with markings on them depicting numbers.

The researchers also note that the brain's asymmetry could have played a role in shaping the mental number line long ago.

During the study, researchers first familiarised chicks with the number five.

Scientists have suggested that golden orb-web spiders may be able to 'count'.

The arachnids create 'prey larders' of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left.

Scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs.

Golden orb-web spiders (Nephila clavipes) wait for prey to fly into their webs, but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders.

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee controlled the number of prey items in the spiders' 'larders' by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again.

They discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web.

Dr Rafael Rodríguez, who led the research, said: We can make a tentative conclusion that these spiders possess a sense of numerosity.' 

They then showed the chicks two different panels - one on the left and one on the right - that both depicted the same, smaller value two.

The noticed the majority of chicks approached the panels to their left in search of a food reward.

Professor Rugani and her colleagues then showed the chicks two identical panels, both depicting a larger value, eight.

This time, they discovered that most of the chicks chose to investigate the panels to their right.

The researchers repeated their experiment using eight as the small value, 32 as the large value, and 20 as the chicks' new target value.

After familiarising a group of chicks with the number 20, they found that the majority of those chicks wandered to the left when presented with panels depicting the smaller value.

Most of the chicks gravitated to the right when the panels displayed the larger value.

Professor Rosa Rugani claims the trait likely evolved millions of years ago, before human ancestors split from those of modern birds.

She says evolution could have led to brain asymmetry as it allowed animals to process information within a dominant hemisphere.

Professor Rugani told the IBTimes UK: 'I would not at all be surprised that the number spatial mapping is also found in other animals and in newborn infants.

'We are now extending the investigation to the study of other animal species. The final aim is to identify the neural areas involved in the number processing.' 

Previous research has found that seven-month-old infants prefer to count left-to-right, regardless of where they're born, according to Discover Magazine.

That preference can change as children gain experience that changes right-to-left counting – for example, learning to read in a right-to-left writing system.
