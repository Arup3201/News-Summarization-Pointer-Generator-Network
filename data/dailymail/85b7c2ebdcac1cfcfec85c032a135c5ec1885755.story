The Top Gear team could find themselves in hot water again, this time in Canada, after they were spotted driving through the city of Vancouver without registration plates.

Pictures showed a bright yellow Ford Raptor pick-up truck, apparently driven by presenter Jeremy Clarkson, as it made its way down Vancouver's Granville Street thoroughfare.

It carried no registration plates and tonight, when asked by MailOnline, a sergeant in the Vancouver Police Department said: 'We would have to pull the driver over.'

It could be the second number plate related gaffe by the Top Gear team in two months, after Clarkson sparked Argentine diplomatic fury by driving through the South American country in a Porsche registered 'H982 FKL'. 

The plates were thought by some to be a veiled reference to the Falklands War of 1982.

But the BBC claims the vehicle was perfectly legal as it had what is known as a 'temporary operating permit' (TOP).

Today Vancouver Police Sergeant Randy Fincham told MailOnline that all cars driving in the province of British Columbia had to have registration plates on their front and rear.

The only exception is for cars given a TOP which, the policeman said, is a piece of paper usually in the back window.

But after viewing these pictures of Clarkson's Ford Raptor driving through his city, Sergeant Fincham said: 'If we had pulled this vehicle over we would have cited it for not having a plate.'

He added: 'We would have to pull the driver over, make sure he's not got the registration permit on his lap or in his glove box. It's got to be visible to the rear.'

If the Top Gear team had failed to register their cars for the road in Canada they could face a further $109 fine

Sergeant Fincham said the temporary operating permit is a fairly large sheet of paper and should be clearly visible, even in the tinted windows of the pick-up used by the Top Gear team.

If they are stopped by Canadian police, the Top Gear team could face fines. For failing to display the registration 'you would potentially be cited for $109 under the motor vehicle act,' said Sergeant Fincham.

'If they don't have vehicle insurance [which they could not have if the vehicle was not properly registered] they could be cited for not having valid motor insurance which is $598.'

If the Top Gear team had failed to register their cars for the road in Canada they could face a further $109 fine, Sergeant Fincham said. Such registration is a prerequisite for getting a car insured.

However, a BBC spokesperson said: 'As a brand new vehicle, the car was being driven with a temporary operating permit which, as permitted by law, was displayed in the car's window.

'At all times the vehicle was insured, registered and road legal as per both US and Canadian law.'

The apparent gaffe is merely the latest controversy for Top Gear, which has faced a string of accusations of poor taste and even racism in the past year, and indeed in previous years.

Comedian Frankie Boyle, himself known for controversial opinions, went so far as to call Clarkson a 'cultural tumour' as he called for the presenter's dismissal from the BBC.

The latest number plate controversy comes after Argentina's ambassador to the UK demanded an apology from the BBC after Clarkson drove through her country with a registration plate which apparently referred to the Falklands War.

But BBC head of television refused to make an apology to Ambassador Alicia Castro and insisted the programme would be broadcast.

In a letter to Ms Castro, Mr Cohen said: 'We will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay.'

He added: 'I am very aware that some have questioned whether the number plates were in some way a prank.

'I would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act.'

Mr Cohen also said 'the BBC was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit'.

The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.'

Ms Castro was not the first diplomat to be upset by the long-running motoring show.

In 2011, the BBC had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador over comments made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.

May described Mexican food as 'like sick with cheese on it' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because 'at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won’t complain, it’s fine.'

In fact the Mexican ambassador, His Excellency Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza, did complain about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' and the BBC was forced to say sorry.
