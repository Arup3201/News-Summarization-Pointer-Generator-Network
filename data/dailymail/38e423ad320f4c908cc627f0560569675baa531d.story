The X Factor might be taking a trouncing in the Saturday night ratings battle from Strictly Come Dancing - but nothing beats ITV’s flagship talent show when it comes to courting controversy.

Louis Walsh's change of heart to send Carolynne Poole packing instead of rival Rylan Clarke in the  opening live show of the series on October 7 prompted 1,345 angry viewers to complain to Ofcom.

But Ofcom said today it will take no action over the complaints because viewers know that the ultimate decision to eliminate contestants or force a ‘deadlock’ situation ‘rests with the judges’.

Controversial: Louis Walsh's (left) change of heart to send Carolynne Poole packing instead of rival Rylan Clarke (right) in the series' opening live show on October 7 prompted 1,345 viewers to complain to Ofcom

The results show went to deadlock, 
with Rylan receiving more viewer votes, but 2,200 viewers complained to 
ITV after a producer was seen whispering into Walsh's ear during the 
live sing-off.

Complaints: Big Brother's June 25 show prompted 1,150 complaints from viewers over the behaviour of Conor McIntyre, pictured

A spokesman for the broadcasting 
watchdog said: ‘Ofcom judged that this matter did not raise issues under
the code as the format of the contest is made transparent.

‘Viewers vote in the knowledge that 
the ultimate decision to eliminate contestants or force a 'deadlock' 
situation rests with the judges.’

This figure is the highest number of 
complaints Ofcom has received for any show this year, a Freedom of 
Information request revealed, with viewers claiming at the time that The X Factor had turned into 
‘The Fix Factor’.

Rylan had stumbled his way through his
song, while Carolynne gave a polished performance – and fellow 
judges Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos had voted for Rylan to leave.

Only Nicole Scherzinger backed the 
Essex singer as she is his mentor. At first, Walsh delayed giving a 
decision for several minutes and appeared to want to keep Carolynne in 
the competition.

But then he backtracked - giving his 
vote to Rylan instead. This led to the ‘deadlock’, which meant the 
decision depended on the result of the public vote.

As Carolynne received the fewest 
public votes, she had to leave the competition. Her mentor, Gary Barlow,
then stormed out of the theatre in disgust.

The episode caused public outrage and Conservative MP Mark Pritchard waded into the row.

Unhappy: TV show True Stories: Gypsy Blood prompted the third most complaints with 509

He said: ‘The X Factor is a huge 
international success and great entertainment, but to stay credible and 
believable it must remain completely open and transparent."

A spokesman for The X Factor said at 
the time: ‘Carolynne had the least amount of public votes so the 
public’s choice to stay in the show was Rylan. Producers always chat to 
judges during the show.’

Trailing the X Factor was Channel 5's Big Brother programme, which amassed 1,150 complaints for its June 25 show which allegedly saw housemate Conor McIntyre 'make threats of sexual and physical violence and bully fellow housemate Deana Uppal.'

The Hertfordshire-based reality show also made it to number six in the list.

'Insensitive': Ofcom received complaints over Kay Burley's report on missing schoolgirl April Jones

The second most complained about programme saw 1,140 people upset about Big Brother on Channel 5.

The complaints were made about the show aired on June 25 which allegedly saw contestant Conor McIntyre ‘make threats of sexual and physical violence and bullied fellow housemate Deana Uppal.’

Big Brother also appeared at number six in the list of most complained about TV shows again for alleged bullying in an episode aired on July 16.

Third on the list was Channel 4’s True Stories: Gypsy Blood aired on January 19 and received 509 complaints, with viewers unhappy with the way the documentary portrayed animal welfare, child abuse and illegal behaviour.

Islam: The Untold Story with Tom Holland prompted a number of complaints to Ofcom

Live: The Silent Ascent broadcast on the Sikh Channel attracted 378 complaints over claims it was ‘inaccurate and contained unsubstantiated claims; was impartial; and contained offensive and disrespectful language.’

Sky News presenter Kay Burley received 310 complaints about her ‘insensitive’ comments to friends and family of missing Welsh schoolgirl April Jones after telling two volunteers looking for the little girl live on air in October that ‘having spoken to the family they don’t expect to find her alive’.

Islam: The Untold Story is the seventh most complained about programme with 287 complainants feeling that the documentary exploring the history of Islam was ‘biased inaccurate and offensive’.

Comedian Leigh Francis received 246 complaints for his show Keith Lemon’s Lemonaid which gave a puppy as a prize to a child upsetting viewers who felt that it promoted an irresponsible view of owning a pet.

The programme Nizam e Mustafa on the 
Ummah Channel received 173 complaints as it was thought to contain 
derogatory comments about other religions including Christianity and 
Judaism. It also contained derogatory comments about preacher Dr 
Tahir-ul-Qadri.

The top ten most complained about TV programmes of 2012 so far:

1 The X Factor: 1,345 complaints

2 Big Brother: 1,140 complaints

3 True Stories: Gypsy Blood: 509 complaints

4 Live: The Silent Ascent: 378 complaints

5 Kay Burley, Sky News: 310 complaints

6 Big Brother: 302 complaints

7 Islam: The Untold Story: 287 complaints

8 Keith Lemon’s Lemonaid: 246 complaints

9 Nizam e Mustafa: 173 complaints

10 Citizen Khan: 168 complaints

Finally controversial BBC 
sitcom Citizen Khan attracted 168 complaints in August as viewers felt 
it disrespected the Qur’an, misrepresented Islam and was offensive to 
Muslims.

According to figures no radio 
programme broadcast since January this year has attracted more than four
complaints and only fifteen received any more than just one complaint.

Chorley FM received four complaints in July this year after broadcasting songs containing offensive language.

Jeremy
Vine’s BBC Radio 2 show attracted three complains in April for his 
comments on the evacuation of a Virgin Atlantic plane which were thought
by viewers to be ‘offensive and patronising’ to plane’s crew members.

There
were two more complaints registered against his show in May with one 
alleging it was offensive for the presenter to state ‘the only good 
kraut is a dead kraut’ and another that he was insensitive to an 
interviewee.

BBC Radio 1
presenter Greg James received two complaints in April this year 
alleging a story read out on air contained ‘unsuitable sexual innuendos’
inappropriate to broadcast at 5.15pm.

Frank
Skinner on Absolute Radio in July received two complaints alleging that
a comment about cutbacks to disability benefits and the Paralympics was
offensive.

An Ofcom 
spokesman said today: 'Each year Ofcom receives several thousand 
complaints from viewers about material that has been broadcast on 
television and radio. We assess every complaint before deciding whether to investigate or not.

'This
is assessment is to establish if there has been a potential breach of 
the Broadcasting Code - the rules that broadcasters much comply with. Our decision to launch an investigation is not dependent on the number of complaints we receive.'
