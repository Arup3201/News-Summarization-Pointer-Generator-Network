Andres Iniesta scored the goal that won Spain the 2010 World Cup but Iker Casillas was just as important in that victory over Holland, particularly the one-on-one save he made from Arjen Robben that the winger recently admitted still gives him nightmares.

It’s safe to say Robben achieved at least a little redemption as Spain collapsed in Salvador, the fleet of foot Dutchman starring in a four-goal second-half blitz.

For Casillas though, it was just the latest instalment in a tragedy that has seen him lose the No 1 spot at his beloved Real Madrid and teeter on the brink of doing so at international level.

Weak link: Spain's heavy defeat against Holland highlighted Iker Casillas' struggles

Tough call: Casillas' drop in form leaves Spain coach Vicente del Bosque with a choice to make regarding his No 1

In Spain they are clamouring for Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea to start in the next group game against Chile on Wednesday.

For so long Casillas has been the bedrock of the Spain national side. Now he looks like a weak link.

The night could have gone so differently for a man once referred to as ‘San Iker’ back home in Madrid.

After keeping four consecutive clean sheets in the knockout stages of Spain’s successful World Cup campaign in 2010, before kick-off against Holland Casillas was 85 minutes from breaking the all-time record for most consecutive minutes without conceding at World Cups.

As it happened he got to within 41 minutes of passing Walter Zuniga’s 1990 milestone of 517 – before another Manchester United player, Robin van Persie, shattered his dream with an outrageous lobbed header right before the break to cancel out Xabi Alonso’s earlier penalty.

There was nothing Casillas could do about that unique finish from Van Persie, but it was a completely different story in the second-half.

Robben’s goal early in the second-half, Holland’s second of the evening, took a slight deflection off Spain centre-back Sergio Ramos but Casillas was well-positioned to stop the strike. He didn’t. The ball looped over his legs and Holland were ahead.

Then in the 64th minute Casillas was at fault for the third Dutch goal, making a mess of a free-kick from the left by parrying the ball on to Stefan de Vrij who bundled home from a yard or so out.

And Holland’s fourth was all Casillas’ making. Ramos slipped a straightforward backpass to him inside the Spain box but his first touch was woeful, allowing Van Persie to nick the ball away and prod it over the line.

Ten minutes from the end it was time for Robben’s revenge. The sight of Casillas, on his 154th international appearance, scrambling to stop the former Chelsea attacker after he jinked past him will linger in the memory. Robben easily evaded Casillas, who lost his footing as he tried to change direction, before the flying Dutchman set himself and fired past the recovering Spain defence.

The worrying thing for Spain is that this flapping, uncertain Casillas is not a new development.

Dropped: Casillas lost his place at Real Madrid under Jose Mourinho

Continuation: Carlo Ancelotti only played Casillas in cup games

In favour: Diego Lopez was the man to replace Casillas between the sticks at the Bernabeu

But for Sergio Ramos’ game-saving header deep into injury time at the end of the Champions League final, Real Madrid would have lost to city rivals Atletico and Casillas would have been to blame.

His decision to sprint from his line and try to gather Diego Godin’s looping header was a colossal error of judgement, as the ball bounced over him and over the line to give Atletico a surprise lead.

De Gea, in contrast, was a rare ray of light in an otherwise bleak season for Manchester United. He made very few mistakes over the course of an ill-fated campaign, as many around him struggled for form.

After rising through the ranks at Casillas’ club enemies Atletico and captaining the Spain Under-21 side De Gea made the switch to Old Trafford in 2011. And despite a rocky start to life in the Barclays Premier League he has since established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the country, if not Europe.

It has been a tough 18 months for Casillas. Dropped by former Real manager Jose Mourinho in favour of Diego Lopez, the 33-year-old has flittered in and out of the team since. He played in most of the cup fixtures under Carlo Ancelotti this season, but featured just twice in La Liga.

With only nine international minutes under his belt – he made his debut in a World Cup warm-up friendly against El Salvador on June 8 – it would be a gamble to start De Gea, but in the wake of Casillas’ latest error-strewn display it could just be one that would pay off for Spain boss Vicente del Bosque.
