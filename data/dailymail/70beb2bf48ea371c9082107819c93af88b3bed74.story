Mob Wives star Alicia DiMichele denied claims that she has been cheating on her husband as she arrived at court for his sentencing yesterday.

The 40-year-old, dressed in a black leather jacket and stiletto boots, was at Brooklyn federal court to support Edward Garafalo, who was facing extortion charges.

Her husband was handed a seven-year jail term, but DiMichele is still waiting to hear what her sentencing will be.

DiMichele hit back at claims that she has been involved in an affair with a restaurant owner while her husband was in custody.

'No, that’s not true. I’m 
here for my husband. I’m just trying to take care of my boys, that’s 
all,' she told the New York Post.

The reality show star, who was allegedly caught on tape talking about embezzling funds for the family's old trucking business, has also been accused of partying across the country while on bail.

DiMichele, who could face up to six months in jail when she returns for sentencing next month, had pleaded leniency because she suffers from panic attacks.

She had worked as a book-keeper for the family-run business, the Daily News reported.

Her attorney also denied allegations that she had been out enjoying herself while on bail.

When her husband appeared in court on Friday, he waved to DiMichele who was sat in the front row with family and friends.

Garofalo is due to appear in the popular Mob Wives through recorded phone calls.
