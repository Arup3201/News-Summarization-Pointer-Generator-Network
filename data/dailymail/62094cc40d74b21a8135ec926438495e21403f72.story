A mother of two who was drenched with her children when a passing motorist drove through a puddle has criticised his punishment... as too harsh.

Samuel Lees, 22, was banned from the road and fined £500 after he hit the standing water at speed, soaking Debbie Pugh and her children David, eight, and Emma, 11, as they walked to school.

A following police car said Lees  created a ‘large wave’ that left a group of schoolchildren screaming after they and their parents were doused with freezing water on January 17.

As well as the fine, magistrates gave 
the shop worker six points, which means that as a new driver he will 
lose his licence. Anyone receiving six points within two years of 
passing their test has their licence revoked.

However, even Mrs Pugh, 48, said  she was stunned by the severity of  his sentence.

The company director, of Colchester, Essex, said: ‘I am very, very shocked by the punishment he has been given.

‘I
 don’t think that is fair at all. I think they must have wanted to make 
an example of him. But I think a slap on the wrist would have been 
sufficient.

‘Perhaps he 
could have gone on a driver awareness course, but what he has got from 
the court is really quite harsh. I would not wish that fine on anybody.’

PC Mark Hercules, the 
traffic policeman who was following Lees in Colchester, said: ‘The 
vehicle was driven through the puddle at a relatively fast speed making 
no attempt to slow down or avoid it.

‘As
 a consequence, a large wave of water absolutely soaked the children and
 their parents. We could hear the screams from the children as they got 
drenched in the cold, dirty rainwater.

‘The motorist drove off. Fortunately, I was able to witness the whole incident.

‘His actions caused distress to the young children.

‘In
 addition, I pointed out the hidden hazards that lie in large puddles 
and the fact he could have lost control of his vehicle and caused a 
danger to other road users.’

On Mr Lees' punishment, Debbie Pugh said: 'I think they must have wanted to make an example of him but I think a slap on the wrist would have been sufficient'

Lees, who has been driving for less than a year, will have to pass both his theory and driving test again to regain his licence.

Chelmsford magistrates also ordered him to pay £90 court costs and a £50 victim surcharge on top of his £500.

Last
 night, he said the loss of his licence meant he faced losing his job 
because he uses his red VW Polo to drive to work in Chelmsford, 25 miles
 from his home in Colchester.

He added: ‘I did not mean to splash the family.

‘I knew there was a police car behind me, so why would I do something like that on purpose when they were following?

‘I turned round a corner and then went through the puddle and was spotted straight away.

‘But
 if you ask anyone who knows me, I am not the kind of person to do 
something like  that on purpose. That’s not what I am like at all.

‘It
 was one lapse of concentration and nothing more than that.  People 
drive through puddles and people do get splashed – it’s unavoidable 
unfortunately. It really is an everyday occurrence, so, yes, I do feel 
hard done by.’

Mr Lees was due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates Court last Saturday, but he did not attend and was punished in his absence. He had recently moved house and said he did not receive the summons

Although unusual, it is not unheard-of for drivers who splash pedestrians to fall foul of police.

In
 2009, a 29-year-old Kerry Callard, from Plymouth, was questioned by 
Devon and Cornwall Police after she posted a video clip of herself 
online soaking pedestrians in a craze called ‘happy splashing’.

She
 was reportedly heard howling with laughter in the 30-second film as she
 drove through a puddle, soaking children waiting at a bus stop.

Four
 years earlier, a man from Yeovil in Somerset was fined £150 and given 
three points on his licence after accidentally driving through a puddle 
at 10mph, soaking the trousers of a workman at the side of the road.
