Arsenal attacking midfielder Mesut Ozil is hoping he can be 'back on the pitch soon' after being ruled out until the new year through injury. 

It was revealed last week that Ozil would be out for up to three months with knee ligament damage. 

The 25-year-old, who picked up the injury during his time on international duty with Germany, has been sent back to his club after undergoing scans.
