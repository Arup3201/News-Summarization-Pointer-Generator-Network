The newly-married Duchess opted to wear eye-catching £1,900 18ct gold drop earrings

While the Duchess of Cambridge's regal plum outfit bagged all the headlines in today's papers, it was a more understated element of her gorgeous outfit that has added extra sparkle.

For Kate was wearing a stunning pair of diamond and citrine earrings as she attended church at Sandringham for the first time yesterday.

Along with her made-to-measure Jane Corbett hat, the newlywed also wore an eye-catching pair of 18ct gold drop earrings.

Made by Chelsea-based Kiki McDonough, famed for her use of vibrant semi-precious stones in daring colour combinations, the 18ct gold drop earrings are worth a cool £1,900.

And the favourite theory among royal watchers and gossips is that they were a Christmas present from her husband, Prince William.

Kate is a fan of the brand and has been spotted at various royal outings wearing the bold designs.

Pieces worn this year include a small silver, diamond-studded cross on a chain with matching diamond earrings and a pair of 18 carat gold Citrine Drop earrings valued at £495 to the Epsom Derby.

Intriguingly, Kiki's designs were once worn by William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as the likes of actresses Rosamond Pike and Emilia Fox.

Kiki who's been designing pieces of jewellry for around for 25 years, told Vogue: 'It is wonderful to see such a stylish young person wearing my designs.

'As a 'modern Royal', Catherine is as chic when dressed down as she is at formal engagements - my jewellery is designed to be worn every day, and Catherine does this beautifully.'

She added: 'I once counted  Princess Diana as one of my most loyal customers and we always had such fun choosing designs for her to wear - she took great pleasure in wearing my jewellery.

'It is a very special added extra that Catherine now enjoys wearing my designs too.'

All eyes were on the Duchess, who will turn 30 in January, as she attended a community service with her husband, Prince William on Christmas morning.

She teamed a simple knee-length frock coat with black platforms which The Mail learnt were specially commissioned for the occasion.

The vertiginous £169 black suede heels were by Spanish designer Mascaro, which also produces the Pretty Ballerina range of pumps favoured by the Duchess..

A spokesperson for family run firm, founded in Menorca, said: ‘They were a special request from her office. I think either the Duchess or somebody she knows previously had this style and they wanted a repeat of it in her size.

'They cost £169 and she paid full price as we have been informed that she cannot accept gifts.’

The shoes had been from a previous season but now the company will reproduce the design now they have received the royal seal of approval – showing once again the Duchess’s newfound fashion power.

.But the real head turner was a hat by milliner Jane Corbett, who regularly creates pieces for the Middleton family.

The pair of diamond drop earrings were on display as she wore her hair in a half up, half down creation.

Other members of the royal family who 
attended the private service included the Queen, the Countess of Wessex,
 Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and the Duke of 
Cambridge.

Kate's presence helped attract a record 3,000 well-wishers to St Mary Magdalene church on the Norfolk estate and police were on hand to manage crowds.

The Queen opted for a lavender wool boucle coat by her dressmaker Karl Ludwig, upon which she had pinned a diamond shell brooch with a pearl at the centre, with a matching white and ivory hat by Angela Kelly.

She accepted dozens of bouquets helped by three of her grandchildren, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and the Wessexes’ daughter Lady Louise Windsor.

Zara Philips, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie also looked elegant in understated ensembles.with clutch bags to hand.

Zara  – who now uses the surname Tindall – attended the traditional event with her husband,  Mike, wearing a black collared coat topped with a
black ruched hat.

Sisters Beatrice and Eugenie, who accompanied their father Prince Andrew, both selected smart double breasted pea coats in shades of black and grey accessorised with matching berets.

Many were eager to hear about Prince Philip's health after the 90-year-old was admitted to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge last Friday after suffering chest pains.

Greeting members of the public, Prince
 Charles told Carmilla Fitt, 71, from Dover, that his father’s health 
was ‘coming on’. He added: ‘He is very well and in very good spirits. He
 is very determined.’

Asked
 by other wellwishers about his grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge said 
he was ‘very well, thank you – getting much better’.

Commentators were surprised by the turnout on Christmas Day, and thousands of fans battled to get a photograph of the Duchess as she walked along the church pathway.

Alison Croose, from King’s Lynn, said: ‘I have not seen crowds like this since back into the Diana days.

‘It
 reminded me of the Diana years – when she introduced Prince William to 
the crowds when he was about seven or eight. It was touching. Diana used
 to have her hand on his back.

‘Now you see William with his hand on Kate’s back. It was really nice.’

With his elder brother taken off the market, it was Prince Harry who was the subject of most female attention.

Several shrieking girls in the crowd  tried to attract the 27-year-old prince’s attention.

He
 obliged by giving one a kiss. Inundated with requests from other fans, 
he blushed and said: ‘I can’t give you a kiss. I’ve already kissed her.’

Also in the royal party, 
Canadian-born Autumn Phillips – daughter-in-law of Princess Anne – 
patted her bump protectively. She is expecting her second baby with the 
princess’s son, Peter, in the spring.
