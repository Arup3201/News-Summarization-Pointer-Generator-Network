She's evangelical about vegetables, obsessive about exercise and she won't let her children touch carbohydrates. Now Gwyneth Paltrow has revealed the secret to her holier-than-thou lifestyle: the Up wristband.

The ultimate health accessory for control freaks, the £99 band from Jawbone uses a built-in motion sensor and Motionx GPS to register the time you spend walking, running or just sitting around. It vibrates if you've been inactive for too long, and a 'stopwatch' lets you note the start and end of specific workout sessions.

It works alongside a smartphone app, which estimates the calories burned. You can input your mood into the app or scan the barcodes on your shopping to calculate your calorie intake.

Everything is relayed back to you as a message on your phone and through vibrations in the wristband, with suggestions for ways you can live more healthily.

The wristband uses Actigraphy - a sensor which measures tiny movements to determine whether you are awake or in a light or deep sleep. With these, it calculates the optimum time to wake you each morning with a gentle vibration through the wristband.

So can it really lead to a healthier you? I've been wearing the Up bracelet for four weeks. It noticed I've not been getting much 'deep' sleep, and correlated this with the convenience food I've been eating in place of real dinners.

Then it suggested I eat leafy greens for a magnesium boost to promote sleep. I took my wristband's advice - and slept like a baby.

After a month of entering my moods on the app, Up saw that on Wednesdays I'm rather miserable. It also noticed, using the motion detection system on the wristband, that on Wednesdays I lazily opt for a bus to work instead of walking, and that my mid-week 'treat' breakfast is high in carbohydrates.

The following Wednesday I walked to work and drank a fruit smoothie instead of scoffing a bacon sandwich and felt energetic all day. Because of Up I've been cutting down on coffee and walking more often - and my mood has improved.

My favourite trick? Up has figured out the optimum length for my mid-afternoon nap: 25.6 minutes. It vibrates at that precise moment, leaving me sparky to face the rest of the day. I may not be able to afford her massage therapist and trainer, but Gwyneth's round-the-clock wellbeing coach is money well spent.
