Watching him cavort with dancers and beauty queens on his recent Caribbean tour, it was hard to picture Prince Harry as a lonely heart.

But the soul-searching young prince has revealed his fear that women are scared off by his ‘job’ in the Royal Family and said he sometimes longed to be ‘normal’.

Although at 27 he is one of the world’s most eligible bachelors, Harry hinted that he has struggled to find a girlfriend who was willing to take on a public role at his side.

Lonely: Prince Harry hinted in an interview with an American news channel that he is struggling to find someone willing to fulfil the role as his Princess

In a candid interview on U.S. 
television, he was asked if being royal lived up to its image. Laughing,
 he replied: ‘No, not at all, ha ha – as any girl would ever tell you. 
It’s sort of, “Oh my God, he’s a prince”. But no. The job that it 
entails – I mean look at me, I’m 27 years old.’

On his chances of marriage, he added: ‘I’m not so much searching for 
someone to fulfil the role, but obviously, you know, finding  someone 
that would be willing to take it on.’

Harry’s only long-term relationship was with Chelsy Davy, 26, and finished in 2009 after five years.

The Zimbabwean-born blonde, now a trainee solicitor, made it clear she 
did not want a life of official duties and shortly after the split Harry
 was spotted taking socialite Astrid Harbord back to Clarence House 
after a night out.

He has been linked with other women, including television presenters 
Natalie Pinkham and Caroline Flack, and lingerie model Florence 
Brudenell-Bruce, but none has led to a lasting relationship.

Instead, 
like Prince Andrew before him, Harry has appeared to revel in his 
freedom as a younger brother, without the responsibility of being a 
future king.

Harry said he and William were ‘slowly coming to terms’ with the reality
 of life as senior members of the Royal Family, as they begin to take on
 some of the Queen’s duties.

They both accept their responsibilities, he 
said, but often long to  exchange palaces and prestige for being ‘just 
completely normal’.

He told CBS News: ‘There’s a lot of times that both myself and my 
brother wish, obviously, that we were just completely normal.’ But he 
added: ‘We’ve been born into this position and therefore we’ll do what 
we need to do. It really is that simple for us.’

Harry’s high profile has caused him frustration when he has sought to 
persuade defence chiefs to let him return to a front-line role in the 
Army.

The prince said it was ‘ridiculous’ for critics to argue that his royal 
status should stop him from returning to active service as an Apache 
pilot, and insisted he wanted to do another tour in Afghanistan.

‘All these people talking, these stories, “Ah, he’s been trained as an 
Apache pilot, he’s never going to see active service, he’s never going 
to get to the front line”.

‘These people live in a ridiculous world to even think that. Especially 
with our Army nowadays, you can’t train people and not put them in the 
role they need to play. I want to serve my country. As I’m still in the 
Army I feel I should get the opportunity to do it again.’

Linked: Trainee pilot Harry was rumoured to have been seeing TV presenter Caroline Flack in 2009 and later  had a brief relationship with lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce who he broke up with in August last year

At his brother's wedding to Kate Middleton in April rumours circulated that Harry was more interested in flirting with maid of honour Pippa than watching Prince William take his vows

Harry said he had been honoured to act as an official representative of 
the Queen, and overwhelmed by the public response to his visits.

‘These are countries that don’t take themselves too seriously. They 
enjoy life. Everything’s fun, and you’ve just got to go along with it.

'You can’t just sit there with your arms crossed and wearing a tie or 
whatever. You’ve got to relax, go with the flow.’

The prince revealed he is planning to help his grandmother celebrate her
 Diamond Jubilee with a night out, hosted by himself, William and their 
cousins Peter, Zara, Beatrice and Eugenie.

‘As her grandchildren, we’ll 
hopefully have a dinner and do something fun, maybe take her out on the 
town.’
