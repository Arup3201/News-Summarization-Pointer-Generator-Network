Britain's first infestation of a the deadly Black Widow spider has been discovered in a machinery plant in East Norfolk.

Engineers at the plant discovered the notoriously viscous spider and after a Google search to identify it called in pest control. Factory workers and office assistants were evacuated by pest control officers as the spider was sealed in an air tight container.

A nest of eggs was later discovered in the same crate where the spider was originally found after more than 100 baby Black Widows hatched from a small sack the size of a pea.

'You could tell it was a Black Widow because of the hourglass pattern on the thorax and the aggressive stance the spider was taken once trapped in our containers,' said Ian Parkinson, a service manager at Abate Pest Control, who dealt with the request.

''We cordoned off the area in the yard where the spider was discovered and created a ring of insecticide around it. We then used ele4ctric and petrol based foggers on the rest of the site.

'After the factory was closed last night we then sprayed the office areas with a water-based insecticide as well.

'We are now satisfied that the premises is safe.'

It is believed that the spiders had come into the country from a delivery of imported machinery goods from Texas.

All products are fumigated before being exported but it remains a mystery as to how the spiders survived.

Mr Parkinson believes that Black Widows can survive up to some weeks after only one large meal so it is not unlikely that they would survive during transit.

Black Widow spiders are considered the most venomous spiders in North America.

The southern Black Widow has the shiny, black, globular abdomen with the distinctive red hourglass on the underside.

'As far as we know this is the first time Black Widows have been found in the UK though there have been some cases of hoaxes,' Mr Parkinson added.

A plan was implemented that included tracking down where antivenom is 
located in the UK, which turned out to be just two hospitals, in Liverpool and London. However, no bites had been reported.Â 

The local
James Paget hospital was notified and medical advice was given should 
anyone receive a bite.

Jon Blake Director of Abate said: 'It was down to the fast reaction of the company who called us to deal with the problem that brought this issue safely under control.

'Black Widows are very notorious spiders identified by the coloured, hourglass-shaped mark on their abdomens.

'This spider's bite is much feared because its venom is reported to be 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake's.

'In humans bites produce muscle aches, nausea, and a paralysis of the diaphragm that can make breathing difficult.

'However, contrary to popular belief, most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage.

'We have been called out for snakes, scorpions and spiders before but never in the past 24 years for one of these deadly creatures.'The Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge has been notified about the case, however Abate have now frozen the spiders to eliminate any danger.
