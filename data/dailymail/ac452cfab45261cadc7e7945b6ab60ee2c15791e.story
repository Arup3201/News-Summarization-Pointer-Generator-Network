Senator Tim Scott made history on Tuesday night when he became the first black senator from the South to be elected to the United States Senate by a popular election.

Sen. Scott, a Republican from South Carolina and the incumbent in his race, defeated Democrat Joyce Dickerson in a landslide, with the race being called just four minutes after the polls closed. 

He became a senator in 2013 after being appointed to fill the seat of Jim DeMint in late 2012, who stepped down to join a Republican think tank, by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.

Historic men: The only other black men to serve in the United States Senate from the South, Sen Hiram Rhodes Revels (left) and Sen. Blanche Kelso Bruce (right) were both appointed to their posts and from Mississippi 

History: Young supporters celebrate Sen. Scott's landmark victory

Only nine African-Americans have been elected or appointed to serve in the United States Senate.

Of those nine, only three, including Senator Scott, have been from the South.

Just as shocking is the fact that the other two senators to serve from the South were Sen. Hiram Rhodes Revels, who was elected by the Mississippi State Senate in 1870 and served just over one year, and Sen. Blanche Kelso Bruce, who was also from Mississippi and served a full term beginning in 1875 after being elected by the state senate.

That means that it took over 130 years for the next black senator to enter the United States Senate.

Until Tuesday however, none of these men had ever won the office as the result of a public election.

President: Six of the black politicians elected to the United States Senate have come from the North, including Barack Obama (above), who was junior senator from Illinois until he gained the presidency

Major moment: A drawing of Sen. Revels being sworn in back in 1870

The six black senators from the North, three from Illinois, two from Massachusetts, and one from New Jersey, all assumed office as the result of a public election, beginning with Massachusetts Sen. Edward William Brooke, III who was elected in 1967.

The other five are Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, Sen. Roland W. Burris, Sen. Mo Cowan, Sen. Cory Booker and, most notably, President Barack Obama. 

Sen. Scott, who is unmarried and owns an insurance agency, is now one of two black senators serving in the U.S. Senate alongside Sen. Booker.

He previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013.
