A 24-year-old driver died today after her car collided with an ambulance, as freezing conditions affected motorists in northern England and Scotland.

Zoe Clark died in the crash in Dumfries and Galloway, which happened as the ambulance was transferring a female patient to hospital following an earlier road accident on the same route.

Two Scottish Ambulance Service employees, the patient and her husband were injured in the crash – and one of the crew members of the crew was airlifted to hospital with potentially serious injuries.

Shocking: Two crew members and a female casualty from an earlier road accident who was in the ambulance

The other three were not seriously injured and were transferred by road to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. Ms Clark had been driving her Vauxhall Corsa near Mennock at about 8.40am.

The accident on the A76 involving the driver, from Carronbridge, Thornhill, came as drivers were warned to take extra care on journeys and allow more time as snow and ice cause disruption.

The road has been closed for an investigation to be carried out and the procurator fiscal has been informed of the circumstances.

Police Scotland said it was too early to say whether freezing conditions had contributed to the accident but drivers are advised to avoid the area.

An ambulance spokesman said: ‘At approximately 8.40am an ambulance was involved in a collision with another car on the A76 near Mennock while transferring two patients to hospital in Dumfries.

‘Our deepest sympathies go out to the family of the driver of the car, who tragically died. One member of the ambulance crew was been airlifted to hospital with potentially serious injuries.

‘The other crew member and the patients were also taken to hospital by ambulance but are not seriously injured.’ 

Officers are working with the council to ensure safe diversions are put in place as some smaller roads nearby have not yet been gritted.

There have also been several incidents on the A74 near Moffat and Beattock, also in Dumfries and Galloway.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘Freezing conditions are currently making for difficult driving conditions and drivers should check their routes before setting off.’ 

Firefighters have issued a warning following an incident yesterday in which a man and a woman were rescued from a car after it left the snow-affected A736 Lochlibo Road in North Ayrshire. 

Scottish Fire and Rescue Service watch manager Paul Timmons said: ‘The weather has definitely turned for the worse in the past couple of days, so we would urge everyone to keep the conditions in mind whenever they're on the road.

‘Snow, sleet and rain all reduce visibility and mean slippery road surfaces, making it more likely people will experience a collision. It can happen to any of us but there are things we can do to reduce the risk.

‘Driving at a safe speed - one that's appropriate for the conditions as well as within the limit - will help protect ourselves, our passengers and others.

‘It's important that drivers remember it takes a much bigger distance to stop when the road is wet, so we always need to make sure there's a big enough gap to the vehicle in front.’

Elsewhere, snow-affected routes including the A9 at Drumochter, the A85 at Glen Ogle and the A93 between Ballater and Glenshee this morning.

Icy conditions were also reported on the M8 as well as on many routes across the Highlands, Western Isles and north east of Scotland.

A Met Office ‘be aware’ warning is in place for high winds for  the rest of this week, with the potential for gusts of 60-70mph rising to 70-80mph in north-western areas.

Forecasters say storm-force winds could batter parts of western and northern Scotland with a risk that large waves could cause spray and over-topping in coastal areas.

Members of the public are being warned of the potential for disruption to travel and power supplies.

And a poll by Asda found that Britain’s motorists will spend a total of five million hours defrosting their cars, with two in four admitting to driving with poor visibility due to running late for work.

Meanwhile, in England, there was more morning misery for rail commuters today with hold-ups into major London stations as well as severe disruption to Eurostar services.

The latest in what has been a series of early-winter signalling problems - at Acton in west London - led to delays of up to 60 minutes to services in and out of London’s Paddington station. Trains between London and the West Country and Wales were affected, with fewer trains able to run.

There were also delays of up to one hour to trains in and out of Liverpool Street station in London due to over-running engineering works. This affected travellers on Abellio Greater Anglia services.
