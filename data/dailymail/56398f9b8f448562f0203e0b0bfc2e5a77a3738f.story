A California family is reeling after thieves stole their Christmas presents right out from under the tree Friday and even took their beloved grandparents' ashes.

The goods were taken Friday by four Grinches who snuck in through the doggie door of the Gmelich family’s Pasadena home, police suspect. They stole presents, emptied stockings and took the urns containing their grandparents' ashes.

A security camera in a nearby alley caught the young men making off with the family’s possessions in broad daylight.

Barren: There were presents under this tree until four Grinches made off with them

‘You could see the TV cords ripped out of the wall,’ Griffin Gmelich, who works in content acquisitions for Hulu, told NBC Los Angeles.

The vile thieves took the children’s piggy banks and even stole urns containing his parents’ ashes.

‘They literally stole my mom and dad,’ Mr Gmelich added.

Christmas ruined: instead of getting presents, the family is installing a burglar alarm and sealing the doggie door

Footprints and fingerprints left behind offer clues, as does the security footage showing the thugs looting the home for nearly two hours.

The items were loaded into a vehicle by the suspects, which police believe may be as young as teenagers. Cops are still searching for them.

The Gmelichs are not taking the heist lightly. A burglar alarm has been installed and the doggie door sealed.

The worst part of all this, Mr Gmelich told the station, is the effect it’s had on his children.

‘They don’t understand,’ he said. ‘The spirit of Christmas? It’s odd to them now.’
