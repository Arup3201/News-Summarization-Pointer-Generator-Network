Formula One’s top designer Adrian Newey has agreed a new multi-year agreement with world champions Red Bull, the team announced on Sunday.

It indicated, however, that the Briton’s focus would no longer be entirely on Formula One.

'As part of this new agreement, Adrian will work on new Red Bull Technology projects, as well as advising and mentoring Infiniti Red Bull Racing as it develops its Formula One cars over the next few seasons,' the team said in a statement.

New deal: Designer Adrian Newey (R) has signed a contract extension with Infiniti Red Bull Racing Team

It said details of the new projects would be announced in due course.

Newey has been at Red Bull since the start of the 2006 season after designing title-winning cars for Williams and McLaren.

Milton Keynes-based Red Bull have won the last four drivers’ and constructors’ championships in a row with Germany’s Sebastian Vettel.

Newey had made clear last month, when he moved to quash speculation about a possible big money bid from rivals Ferrari, that he wanted to stay at Red Bull despite the current domination of Mercedes.

'I remain committed to Red Bull for the foreseeable future,' the 55-year-old Briton said at the Monaco Grand Prix.

Newey has 
been linked to Ferrari in the past as well as a switch to Americas Cup 
yachting, but has forged a close working relationship with Red Bull team
 principal Christian Horner.

Broader horizons: Adrian Newey's new role will not be restricted to the development of F1 cars only

Horner told reporters in Monaco that Newey had a 'paternal feeling' towards Red Bull.

'He
 has been involved (with the team) since the beginning,is much more 
involved than he has been at any other team, and he enjoys the 
environment he works in,' said the Briton. 

Speaking to Press Association Sport, team principal  Horner refused to categorically define Newey's new role.

'It's
 great news for us as it shows he is still committed to Red Bull and 
he's going to be around for multiple years,' said Horner.

'We're
 now going to take on some exciting new projects we will talk about 
later in the summer, so it's good for everyone - good for Red Bull, good
 for Adrian and good for the whole team.'

Asked whether Newey would still continue to design cars, Horner replied: 'He's still going to be involved, mentoring and advising the design team.

'He's a wealth of experience and knowledge the design team will be drawing upon.

'He'll still be involved, for sure, but the details will come a bit later in the summer. We'll sit down with you guys and give you a bit more information.'
