Whoopi Goldberg had her The View co-hosts all rallied against her during a discussion in which she supported a highly controversial discipline technique in the third episode of the revamped series Wednesday.

With Nicolle Wallace, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez all shaking their heads in abject disapproval, Whoopi sided with a Michigan dad who recently forced his 4-year-old son to humiliate himself on a roadside with a sign that read 'I hit little girls.'

'That father took a great step and I'm proud of him,' Whoopi said of the man who could lose custody of his son for the stunt.

Whose side are you on? Whoopi thinks a Michigan man who punished his 4-year-old by forcing him to hold up a humiliating sign was in the right

Rosie Perez was first to shun what Rob Devine forced his son Tristan to do.

'He's a little kid,' the actress asserted, raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show. 'He's 4-years-old, it's a little bit extreme.'

Whoopi wouldn't back down, though, so former George W. Bush aide Nicolle Wallace put in her two-cents.

'I don't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming,' said the communications maven.

Then, as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on Tuesday, a miracle happened: resident fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell agree with Wallace.

'Shame is never a way to teach a child anything' said O'Donnell, whose own special-needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy. 'They're not emotionally ready to understand.'

But even in an episode where the panel touched on the Adrian Peterson child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist's office, day three was a departure from day two when Wallace and O'Donnell shared some seriously tens 

Disagreement: It was Whoopi's turn to anger the group on Wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine

Whoopi agreed: The creative punishment used by Rob Devine (right) when he discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic The View clash. Nicolle and both Rosies said 4-year-old is too young to humiliate a child

The once-booted co-host compared a characterization Wallace made of Obama's lack of warmth with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people.

'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.'

O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her.

'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.'

Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree.

Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!'

Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being.

The season 15 premier on Monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years.

According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series.
