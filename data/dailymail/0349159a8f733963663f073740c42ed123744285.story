Louis van Gaal has told Rene Meulensteen his services will not be required at Manchester United next season.

Meulensteen was previously employed by United under Sir Alex Ferguson and enjoyed great success at the club before he left following the appointment of David Moyes last summer.

Since then the Dutch coach has had two short and troubled spells as a manager at Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia and Fulham in the Premier League.

Rejected: But new United boss Louis van Gaal will bring his own staff to Old Trafford

Meulensteen has been out of work since his departure from Fulham in February but he has revealed a desire to return to Old Trafford to work under countryman Van Gaal.

However, the Holland boss has rejected that plan and will bring his own coaches to United.

'I would have been keen to go back,' Meulensteen said at the release of the LMA Annual Castrol European Managers and Coaches Survey.

'I spent 12 years at what is a fantastic club and never left Man United because I fell out with anyone there.

'But they've chosen to appoint Louis van Gaal and he has decided to bring in his own people so that is not an option.

'Have I spoken to Van Gaal? Yes, I know that is the case - it has been confirmed to me.'

He added: 'It is disappointing. When you spend 12 years at a club the size of Manchester United, working in every department - not least for five years with the first team which were the most successful in the history of the club - of course you are disappointed.

'There aren't many coaches who have spent so much time with one club as I have.'

Meulensteen remains keen to try his hand at management again despite bad experiences last season.

'I am definitely keen to get back into it,' he said. 'I've had an experience not many coaches have had because I worked in a very professional environment at United with a lot of stability and then the last 12 months have been the complete opposite.

'But it hasn't put me off at all, it only makes me stronger and more aware.'
