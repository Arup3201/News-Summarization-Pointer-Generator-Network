Rough Copy have missed out on a place in The X Factor final.

The group lost out to Luke Friend, after the two acts received the lowest number of votes from the public after their two performances on Saturday night's show.

While they were picked by their mentor Gary Barlow and Nicole Scherzinger to go through to the final, they lost out when Sharon Osbourne chose to go deadlock – allowing Luke who received the most public votes to go through to the final. 

Missing out: Rough Copy will not be going through to the X Factor final after losing their place on Sunday evening

The decision means Luke will join Sam Bailey and Nicholas McDonald in the final.

Gary was the first judge to cast his vote and said: ‘This is harder than usual because the acts are so different. It was an emotional sing off, you’ve both done so well.’

Louis went next and said: ‘It’s very simple – Luke Friend’

Struggling Nicole said: ‘Luke you sang one my favourite songs tonight, you are such a diamond in the rough in this competition. But the act I’m sending through is Rough Copy.’

Fight: They lost out to Luke Friend after Sharon sent the vote to deadlock

Gracious: The group were hugely thankful for the opportunity given to them

Emotional: The two acts were very emotional ahead of their performances

Sharon was last to pick and after a pause said she was going to put it deadlock, meaning the act with the most votes would go through to the final, which in this case was Luke.

After they were voted of Joey, from Rough Copy told Dermot:  ‘Just being here is a highlight. I thank Gary for everything he has done for us.’

The band then turned the audience and shouted: ‘If you believe in us, make some noise.’

Can't decide: Sharon was unable to make a decision and sent the vote to deadlock

Moving: The two acts were very supportive of each other and hugged away throughout

Giving it their all: Rough Copy performed Boyz II Men's End Of The Road

Impassioned: Luke performed Keane's Somewhere Only We Know

Luke was the first act to take part  in the sing-off and he sung a very impassioned version of  Keane’s Somewhere Only We Know  with his guitar in a bid to remain in the competition.

His moving performance got a standing ovation from the judges.

Rough Copy were the second to sing –picking  Boyz II Men's End Of The Road and delighted the crowd moving around the stage.

Performing on the show was X Factor alumni Leona Lewis, who
famously won the show in 2006.

Shock: Louis Walsh couldn't quite believe that Rough Copy had been sent home

Too much: Nicholas also found the whole situation hugely emotional

The  28-year-old sung
her song One More Sleep from her upcoming festive album and the setting was
suitably Christmassy.

While she started her performance looking like a Christmas tree
fairy with a full skirt – she took it off to reveal a sparkly Sixties style
shift dress with thigh high boots.

She was joined on stage by dancers dressed as Christmas
trees and as various trinkets which can be found on a Christmas tree and even a
Santa Claus in latex.

The final three: Sam, Luke and Nicholas all looked a little shell shocked about being in the final

So pleased: Sam and Sharon couldn't hide their happiness when they found out Sam was through

Following her performance she gave advice to the contestants:
‘Oh my gosh, you’ve just give it all you’ve got. At this point it’s all about
topping every performance.’

When asked who she was backing, while at first she said she
couldn’t pick she admitted: ‘I’ve worked with Sam and we’ve been messaging on
Twitter, so Sam.’

Leona was followed by Canadian Crooner Michael Buble, who
performed alongside a full brass band.

Over the moon: Nicholas let out a scream when he found out he was through

It was the second week that Luke found himself in the sing-off - last time it was  with Tamera
Foster but he seemed determined to give it his all on Saturday evening.

Ahead of the performance, he said: 'This is a completely
different version to the original, I'm taking a big risk with this...I'm
definitely going to channel my inner diva.'

For this second performance of the evening he belted out
Something About The Way You Look Tonight but said he was worried because the
last time he sang an Elton John song, he ended up in the bottom two.

Break down: The Scottish singer fell to the floor as the news sunk in

Letting their hair down: Rough Copy seemed to enjoy the group song

Rough Copy meanwhile sang an upbeat version of Destiny's
Child hit, Survivor and said the words meant a lot to them as they feel like
they have been surviving the competition.

Nicole said: 'The semi-finals have finally begun. Thank you
for that. You being the excitement, the life, the energy to the show. This is
the 'RC' anthem.

‘You are survivors and you are going to survive all the way
to the finals.'

But Louis angered Nicole when he said the trio should have
held something back.

All together now: Sam, Luke and Nicholas sung together

Christmas cheer: Before the dreaded votes Michael Buble took to the stage

Sharon agreed with him and said: 'OK, perfect song for you,
you bring a good spirit to the show. It's all overload for me, people humping
the floor, backpacks.. just pull the reigns in a bit.'

But Gary scoffed: 'This is not the time to pull the reigns
in, it's the semi-final. That was electric. The vibe in this room suddenly went
up 10 gears.'

For their second song they picked Sorry Seems To Be The
Hardest Word, but admitted they were concerned that what Elton does as an
artist is very different to what they would do.

Fairy: Leona Lewis looked like a Christmas fairy when she performed on the show

The moment of truth: The X Factor judges looked a little apprehensive as they made their way on stage

It was perhaps only fitting that in the worst series of The X Factor for years, the best act in the semi final was sent home.

Rough Copy’s posturing, emoting and crotch thrusting may have been so overboard that they looked ludicrous, but their versions of songs by Beyonce and Elton John were easily the best on Saturday night.

I’m A Survivor was modern and energetic and Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word was stripped down and, unusually for this competition, in tune.

By contrast young Nicholas’ rendition of Halo was judged by everyone on the panel to be ‘pitchy’ and too weedy.

He admitted himself that he couldn’t connect with the song ‘because I’ve never had my heart broken or been in love’ - except perhaps with his teddy bear.

Sam’s attempt to take on Candle In The Wind left her looking less like a Leona Lewis or Alexandra Burke than a rather ordinary wedding singer.

As for Luke Friend, his caterwauling version of Somewhere We Only Know was so painful it was comical.

Nicholas and Luke have seemingly been voted for on their youth and, in Nicholas’ case, as Louis kept reminding the audience at every opportunity, because he was from Scotland. Sam seems to be universally popular with viewers because she’s so nice.

Rough Copy will probably be more successful than all of them because there’s a huge gap in the market for a UK version of Boys II Men or a more grown-up JLS.

But in terms of winning it, their big mistake was to think The X Factor was a contest about singing.
