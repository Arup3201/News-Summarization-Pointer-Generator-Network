Three years since he passed away, Steve Jobs' spirit still lives on in the offices and corridors of Apple headquarters in Cupertino.

The late entrepreneur's office on the fourth floor even has his name on the door and the interior is just as he left it, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

'He stood for innovation, for the simple, not the complex. All of these things are still deep in our company,' said Cook in an interview for PBS.

Cook added he was shocked when the Apple co-founder offered him the position of chief executive in 2011.

He said he doesn't want to deviate from Jobs' strategy to 'only enter areas where we can control the primary technology.'

'I have wanted desperately to continue his legacy and the Apple I deeply love,' he said.

Cook added 'I literally think about him every day...[he] is in my heart. His spirit will always be at the foundation of the company.'

The comments were made during an interview on 'The Charlie Rose Show' which will be aired in the US on Friday night and again on Monday on PBS.

Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs worked for more than a year on the products that he believed would safeguard the company's future.

He also fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style company headquarters in California.  

Jobs had a part-time job working for Hewlett Packard at the site when he was 13 and he ensured Apple bought the land when it became available.

He also oversaw the development of the delayed iCloud project, which allowed Apple users to store their music, photos and other documents remotely and masterminding updated versions of the iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks.

The co-founder ensured that at least four years’ worth of products are in the pipeline, according to Apple sources.

Reports also suggest Jobs wanted to design an Apple car before he died. Jobs reportedly told the Times' John Markoff, during a meeting prior to his death, that he wanted to 'take on Detroit.' 

During the interview, Cook also spoke about claims the firm is able to access user's content in the wake of the iCloud hacking scandal.

He said reports of the NSA had backdoors into Apple servers were untrue - telling Charlie Rose 'We would never allow that to happen, they would have to cart us out in a box before we did that.'

He said: 'We're not reading your email, we're not reading your iMessages.'

The chief executive also took aim at Google in the interview, although refused to name them.

'If they are making money by collecting gobs of personal data, you should be worried,' he said.

The first part of Cook's interview covered Apple TV.

Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011 - but another launch event has passed without it making an appearance.

Cook revealed that TV is an area the firm continues to have great interest in, but admitted 'if we're really honest, it's stuck back in the seventies.'

'The hardest decisions we make are all the things not to work on,' Cook told the chat show host.

'There's lots of things we have interest in, but we know we can't do everything great.'

Earlier this year, reports claimed Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV had been delayed until next year. Apple engineers working on the gadget were told not to expect it to launch until 2015, and the delay was blamed on cable companies refusing to carry out deals with the technology giant
