Mohammed Merah killed three schoolchildren, a rabbi and three paratroopers

Police recordings of the Toulouse gunman while he was under siege suggest he was a psychopath who took 'infinite pleasure' in killing his victims.

Islamic extremist Mohammed Merah, 23, murdered seven people including a Rabbi, three children and three soldiers in three seperate scooter-bourne attacks before being shot dead at the end of 32-hour police siege.

But during the stand-off following the murders, Merah showed no remorse - and even claimed his only regret was arriving too late to kill more Jews outside the Lycee Ozar Hatorah school.

In police recordings of Merah, leaked to a French newspaper, he boasted that the killings gave him 'infinite pleasure'.

The Independent reported that Merah said he had no interest in being a suicide bomber and just wanted to 'see' his victims, 'touch them' and 'film them.

He told police negotiators he wanted to 'have the honour of dying with a gun in my hand like a mujaheddin'.

The French newspaper Journal du Dimanche quoted a police source as saying: 'He wanted to give himself a star role.

'He had a narcissistic need to seem important.'

The French-Algerian, a known fundamentalist, had been on a French security service 'watch list' since 2008, was on the U.S. no-fly list, and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp.

After the first the series of attacks
 he was placed on a list of possible suspects but little was done to 
trace him until the Jewish school massacre when he shot a teacher and 
his two sons, aged four and five, as well as a seven-year-old girl.

Following the murders he resisted 
arrest for 32 hours while under siege at his council flat but was killed
 by gun wounds in a blazing shoot out with police last Thursday.

Merah, who filmed himself carrying out
 the executions of four Jewish people and three French soldiers, had 
fought in Afghanistan and was a self-styled Jihadist.

He said he wanted to kill Jewish 
children in revenge for the lives of Palestinian youngsters who had died
 at the hands of the Israeli army.

Bernard Squarcini, head of French 
internal security service, told Le Monde newspaper: 'He (Merah) 
resembles no other pattern we have seen until now...

'What he did points to a mixture of medical problems and a fanaticism than the usual career of a jihadist.'

Merah's brother Abdelkader Merah, 29, 
has since appeared before an anti-terrorist judge and formally charged 
with ‘complicity in murder’.

Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week

In a statement read out soon 
afterwards, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said: ‘The investigations 
being handled by the police have established the existence of serious 
evidence against Abdelkader Merah corroborating, or making plausible, 
his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in 
connection with a terrorist enterprise.’

Adbelkader has already told police 
interrogators that he was ‘very proud’ of what Merah did, and admitted 
to dining with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in 
Toulouse.

His charging came as his wife, 30-year-old Yamina Mesbah, was freed yesterday after being held for four days by anti-terrorism police.

She said she was 'hugely relieved, but concerned about her husband.'

The pair married religiously as Muslims in 2006, but had never formally wed civilly, as they would be required to do by French law.

Ms Mesrah's lawyer, Guy Debuisson, said that knowledge of Mohammed Mesrah's crimes had been 'like a bomb which exploded infront of her eyes.'

Meanwhile, Merah is being held up as 
an martyr in some quarters, with Jewish cemeteries targeted in attacks 
which police are linking to the Merah atrocities.

Riot police have also been called to 
housing estates on the outskirts of major cities like Paris because of 
anti-Semitic demonstrations being held in support of the 23-year-old 
killer.

There are some 500,000 Jews in France,
 and security measures around them have increased after Merah shot a 
rabbi and three children at a school in Toulouse last Monday.

There are some six million Muslims 
living in France, making up the largest group of its kind in western 
Europe, but Islamic leaders have rejected Merah as being utterly 
unrepresentative of a largely peace-loving and law-abiding community.

The 
girlfriend of one of Merah’s victims said she intended to marry her 
partner in a posthumous ceremony.

Caroline
 Monet, 21, has been given presidential permission to wed 25-year-old 
Corporal Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead at a cash machine in the town 
of Montauban, near Toulouse, this month.

Her lawyer, Gilbert Collard, said Ms Monet had received approval from President Nicolas Sarkozy for the ceremony to take place.

Posthumous marriages are unusual in France, but they can be sanctioned in ‘grave circumstances’, said Mr Collard.

'I’ve already had it done twice, for policemen’s girlfriends,' he said.

'It’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse.

'There won’t be any problems with approval, and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father.'
