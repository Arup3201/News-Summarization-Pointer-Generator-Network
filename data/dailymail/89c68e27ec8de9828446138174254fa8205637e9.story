Lukas Podolski came off the substitutes' bench to make his Serie A debut at the Juventus Stadium but it was new team-mate Mauro Icardi who made the difference in helping Inter Milan claim a point against Juventus.

Tevez showed his former manager Roberto Mancini what he was missing by scoring an early opener against Inter however his effort was cancelled out by compatriot Icardi.

Juventus forward Tevez said in the run up to his side's home match against Inter that he was not focused on going up against a side managed by Mancini.

However he must have been delighted to score  against a side coached by a manager he did not exactly see eye-to-eye with during his stint in the blue half of Manchester.

Tevez scored his 16th goal of the season in the fifth minute after a fantastic piece of skill by team-mate Arturo Vidal.

The Chile international tricked his way past fellow countryman Gary Medel before crossing to Tevez, who had the easy task of tapping into an empty net from close range.

Another former Premier League star in Paul Pogba came close to doubling Juventus' lead when he skipped past two Inter defenders before being denied at the final hurdle by Samir Handanovic.

Mancini could face more misery during the course of the next few days as Inter Milan defender Juan is likely to be punished for what appeared to be a deliberate elbow on Giorgio Chiellini.

Podolski, who completed a season-long loan move to Inter from Arsenal on Monday, replaced Zdravko Kuzmanovic in the 54th minute.

It was Podolski's new team-mate Icardi who got his side back on level terms with a fine piece of solo work before smashing the ball low past Gianluigi Buffon. 

Icardi had a golden chance to snatch the three points for his side after latching on to a cross by Podolski, however his shot went wide of Buffon's post. 

Dani Osvaldo nearly clashed with Icardi when the Argentine decided to shoot at goal from a tight angle, however Fredy Guarin stepped in to split his team-mates apart.

Inter Milan were reduced to 10 men with four minutes to go when Mateo Kovacic was shown a straight red card for a lunging challenge on Stephan Lichtsteiner but Mancini's side held on to claim a point.

Next up for league leaders Juventus is fourth-placed Napoli  on Sunday, while Inter will welcome Genoa to the San Siro.
