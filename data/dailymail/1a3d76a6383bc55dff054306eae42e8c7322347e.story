Manchester United head to the Black Country and a game at West Brom on Monday night with manager Louis van Gaal hoping for a performance and a result that will kick-start his reign at Old Trafford.

The Dutch coach has said he needs a result similar to the Champions League win at Juventus that suddenly fired his Bayern Munich team in to life in December 2009.

The Hawthorns may seem a long way from the Stadio Olimpico in Turin but if Van Gaal is to see his new team produce the first comprehensive performance of his time in the Barclays Premier League then here are five things that must happen.

UNITED MUST KEEP GOING

After years of seeing United snatch results at the end of games, the reverse has been true this season. 

Sir Alex Ferguson revealed last year that his United teams actually used to practice scoring late goals in training. Van Gaal's players, though, don't seem to be able to play beyond an hour, having failed to score a single goal after 63 minutes in any competition all season.

Their last two home games – wins against Everton and West Ham – saw United hanging on at the end, saved by goalkeeper David de Gea and a linesman's flag in those matches. 

Whether it is a psychological issue – indicative perhaps of a lack of confidence – or something to do with physical fitness, it is hard to say. Van Gaal's messages regarding his training sessions have been contradictory though – saying last Friday he has had to lower the intensity at Carrington – and he needs to find a way to get 90 minutes out of his players tonight.

FIND THE REAL ROBIN VAN PERSIE

When Van Persie dived to head in Holland's equaliser in their opening World Cup game against Spain back in June, the bond between the United striker and his coach for club and country seemed clear. 

Since then, though, Van Persie has done little to suggest a return to the scoring heights of his first United season two years ago is imminent. 

He has not been dreadful this season, far from it. He has scored two Premier League goals, which is only one less than Wayne Rooney and is one more than Radamel Falcao.

Robin van Persie has only netted two goals in six Premier League appearances under Louis van Gaal

However, the Dutchman is not the free-running irresistible force of two years ago and it is tempting to wonder if he would actually start on Monday night were Rooney not suspended.

Rumours persist of ongoing problems with Van Persie's knee while an argument with team-mates during last week's Holland win over Kazakhstan saw him criticised by former captain Mark van Bommel. 

As we know, Van Persie likes to be the star of the show. Time to show that he deserves to be, perhaps.

KEEP THE BALL

Van Gaal is nothing if not honest and recently he hinted at a modern United issue when he said: 'I want to improve so we don't lose the ball so easily. That is our problem, not our defence. We are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline.' 

The days of United smothering opposition with possession seem a long time ago now. David Moyes' team certainly didn't do it and even the latter years of the Sir Alex Ferguson saw United play much more counter attacking football than they wished.

Now that United have a team packed with ball players, it shouldn't be that difficult but one wonders if the likes of Falcao, Angel Di Maria and Juan Mata are prepared to do as much work in their own half as the Premier League tends to ask. 

After all, the first things good teams – really good teams – tend to do when they lose the ball is get it back again.

FIND A SCREEN

United are away from home on Monday night and that usually dictates that a team will have to spend some time in their own half. West Brom may not be the most glamorous or talked-about team in the Premier League but they are quite happy to get on the front foot in front of their own supporters and that will certainly be the case early on at The Hawthorns. 

When that happens, United need to find a way to screen the back four. With Van Gaal playing so many attacking players each week, the demands on more defensively-minded players like Daley Blind simply increase.

Blind looks to be an exceptional purchase so far, a hard-working, intelligent player who buys in to the team ethic naturally and is happy to do his bit without the need for fanfare. However, against the Baggies he will need some help from whoever players alongside him. 

Ideally it would be Michael Carrick, who brings some height and physicality to the role. However he is not quite fit so if the Spaniard Ander Herrera is pressed into action despite the pain of his rib injury he will need to sacrifice a little of his naturally offensive tendencies to help protect what continues to be a rather uncertain United back four.

KEEP THE ANGEL FLYING

With Rooney serving the second game of his suspension and nobody sure what we are going to get from players like Van Persie and Mata, it is imperative that the talented Di Maria continues his good form.

Di Maria has taken to life in the Premier League without breaking stride and his performances for Van Gaal have been a consistent bright spot of United's rather up and down season so far. 

Angel di Maria has three goals and three assists in five Premier League appearances for the Red Devils

The great thing about a free-running forward like Di Maria is that he attracts players to him when he has the ball – and to a lesser degree when he hasn't – and that spreads uncertainty in a defence and, of course, leave spaces open for other players to exploit. 

United haven't really had anything like this since Cristiano Ronaldo left and the similarities between the two players are clear. Ronaldo could be devastating away from home as United flew at teams on the counter and Di Maria can be the same in the Black Country.
