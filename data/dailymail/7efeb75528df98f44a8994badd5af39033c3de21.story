Security guards wrestled a man to the ground after he tried to steal from a £250,000 Rolls Royce by smashing one of its passenger windows in front of horrified Christmas shoppers.

The man was 'held down' by guards and passers-by next to the blue Wraith Coupe outside Oxford Street's Plaza shopping centre in central London, as police were called to the scene.

Kosto Markovski, 46, was taken away by officers and charged with criminal damage and theft from a motor vehicle.

Mr Markoviski has been bailed to re-appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court. 

Shoppers recalled seeing a man smashing the window of the car while, it is thought, its owners were in a nearby hotel. 

'A security guard from the nearby shopping arcade saw it happen and grabbed him, then other members of the public jumped on the guy and held him down,' one witness told the Evening Standard. 

He added: 'Police said they were unsure if there was an accomplice or not, and that the Met helicopter was scrambled.'

Witnesses said security guards held a man on the ground until police arrived at the central London scene 

A 46-year-old man was arrested and charged with theft from a vehicle and criminal damage on Monday
