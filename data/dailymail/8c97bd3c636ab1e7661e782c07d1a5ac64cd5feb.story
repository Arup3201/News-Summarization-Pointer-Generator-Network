Close shave: Golfer Rory McIlroy - pictured with his girlfriend, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, in April - almost failed to arrive in time for his match

Europe’s Ryder Cup team achieved one of the great golfing comebacks last night despite star player Rory McIlroy nearly failing to arrive in time for his match.

In an extraordinary turnaround, they beat their US hosts 14½ to 13½ in Chicago. Overnight, they were 10-6 down and all but written off.

The fightback got off to the worst possible start however when the European team realised McIlroy was not at the Medinah course ready to tee off.

He had checked the start times on his phone but it was set to the wrong American time zone. And he still had not realised his mistake when a frantic call came through from his team-mates, telling him he had just 25 minutes to get from his hotel to the course.

He was lucky enough to be able to hail a police car, which got him there with just ten minutes to spare. A few minutes later and the 23-year-old Northern Irishman would have been disqualified.

McIlroy, who is dating tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, said: ‘I read the tee times on my phone, and they are obviously on Eastern time and it’s Central time here,’ he added.

He joked: ‘At least I wasn’t in the back (of the police car). We got here as fast as we could.’

Asked how quickly he calmed down after his crazy journey, McIlroy replied: ‘As soon as I got here.

'If I warm up for 40 minutes it’s a long time anyway. I warmed up for 25 minutes before I won the (US) PGA this year. It was nearly a good thing because I did not have to think about it too much.’

McIlroy pulled up at the clubhouse ten minutes before he and US opponent Keegan Bradley teed off. It gave him just enough time for an energy bar and a minute of practice on the putting green.

He then calmly beat Bradley to start the European surge. Team captain Jose Maria Olazabal admitted his heart was ‘racing quicker than expected’ when his main man failed to show.

‘We did not have that in mind,’ he said. ‘All of a sudden we realised Rory was not here and started to look for him. Finally we got hold of him and he came in with a police escort.’

Colin Montgomerie, who led the team to a home victory in Wales in 2010, said of the McIlroy drama: ‘That is absolutely ridiculous at this level. It’s quite unbelievable for the world number one golfer.

‘How this happened I do not know. Where is the captain? Where are the vice-captains? Where is his caddie?’

Trailing 10-6 overnight, Europe needed eight points from the day’s 12 singles matches to retain the cup. Players get a point for winning their head-to-head clashes and half a point for drawing.

Dressed in the colours of the late Seve Ballesteros, Europe pulled off what will go down as the ‘Miracle of Medinah’.

Olazabal, who formed with Ballesteros the greatest partnership in Ryder Cup history, cried after the victory was confirmed.

‘It means a lot – not just for me,’ he said. ‘This is for the whole of Europe, all those 12 wonderful men, my four vice-captains and that band of caddies.’
