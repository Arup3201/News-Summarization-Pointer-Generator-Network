James Attfield, who was found with more than 100 stab wounds, was described as 'shy and polite' by his family

Police have arrested a man in connection with the murder of a 'vulnerable' father-of-five who was found with more than 100 stab wounds.

Officers investigating the death ofÂ James Attfield, 33, say a 38-year-old man from Colchester, Essex, is being questioned.

But detectives have refused to reveal what the suspect is being held on suspicion of for 'operational reasons'.

The victim, who suffered a severe brain injury in a traffic accident four years ago, died at the scene in Castle Park, Colchester, on Saturday morning.

A post-mortem examination revealed 102 separate wounds on his arms, hands, back, neck and head.

Mr Attfield was still alive when he was discovered in the early hours of the morning but died shortly afterwards.

Earlier, Mr Attfield's devastated mother made an emotional appeal to find her son's 'maniac' killer.

In a press conference at Essex Police headquarters in Chelmsford, Julie Finch said: 'This to me seems a senseless and frenzied attack on a gentle, vulnerable young man.

'So please, if anyone saw my son, please come forward. Somebody, somewhere knows something - no matter how insignificant you think it is, please inform the police.

'This maniac is still out there.'

Mrs Finch, of Coggeshall, Essex, said she had been left feeling 'numb' by the events of recent days and said she is doing all she can to help police with their investigation.

She revealed she had not seen her karaoke-loving son since last October but said they remained in contact.

She added: 'Jim was well-liked and 
polite and everybody always had a good word to say about him. I would 
ask the public for any information they may have which could help the 
police with their enquries.

'I am still numb - there has been so much going on that I don't think I have really taken it in yet.'

Mrs Finch sat alongside her partner, Vince Sellars, and Mr Attfield's sisters Joanne Robinson, 29, and Ashlee Waller, 18.

Final moments: Police have released these CCTV images of Mr Attfield drinking alone in the River Lodge pub

Investigators say the Mr Attfield spent more than four hours in the bar which is close to where his body was found

She appealed directly to anyone who knows the killer to contact police.

She
 said: 'Just come forward, it does not matter what it is, even if you 
think it is something silly, if you have got any suspicions about anyone
 or if you think their behaviour has changed. Just come forward and tell
 the police.

'We need to find who did this.'

The family have been left mystified as to why the attack took place.

Officers say Mr Attfield left at 10.09pm leaving three quarters of a pint behind, described as 'unusual'

Castle Park in Colchester, where Mr Attfield was killed. Police are appealing for information on the incident

She
 added: 'He would not have provoked anybody or done anything. He was 
always very quiet and even as a child he was always a bit cowardly, if 
you like, if there was a bit of trouble he would rather go and hide than
 be involved in anything that was going on.

'He was always very shy and quiet - he was the same as an adult.'

Experienced
 officers have been left stunned by the nature of the frenzied stabbing 
which was so severe that the post mortem took eight-and-a-half hours to 
complete.

Mr Attfield was known for enjoying a quiet life and avoiding conflict

Mr Attfield, 
described as vulnerable due to a car crash which left him with brain 
injuries four years ago, had been spotted on CCTV drinking at the nearby
 River Lodge pub earlier in the evening.

A team of specialist forensic officers have continued fingertip search of the park.

A team of marine officers have today been searching the nearby River Colne for the murder weapon thought to be a knife.

The
 force has also issued a publicity poster in the hope that drinkers who 
were out on Friday night may have seen Mr Attfield, who lived in 
sheltered accommodation in the town.

Chief Superintendent Carl O'Malley said: 'This is an extremely serious crime and we are taking this matter extremely seriously.

'Lower Castle Park where James was found is a very green, pleasant and leafy area of the county.

'I'm
 acutely aware this will cause the public to be disconcerted I will 
reassure the public we want to work with us and ring in information.'

Mr Attfield was found by a member of the public just before 5.45am on Saturday.

It
 is not clear at this stage what time he had been attacked. He died at 
the scene whilst paramedics were desperately attempting to save him.

DCI Simon Werrett said: 'I would urge 
members of the public to continue to call my team with any information 
they might have about the whereabouts of James Attfield or anything they
 may have seen or heard in the Castle Park area during the early hours 
of Saturday morning.

'This is very much a fast moving and on-going investigation which really needs information from the public.'
