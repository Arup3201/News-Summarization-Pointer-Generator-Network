Nearly 100 suspected war criminals applied to stay in Britain last year – and barely a handful have been sent home.

The figures prompted warnings that this country could be turned in to a ‘retirement home’ for torturers and murderers.

Some 800 suspected war criminals have applied to remain here over the last eight years.

Checks: Of the 99 suspects, three were deported last year, 20 were refused asylum and 46 had their citizenship bids turned down but are likely to have remained in the UK (file picture)

However, human rights laws invariably 
mean that the worse their crimes, the more difficult it is to send them 
home.

After confessing what they have done, war criminals can then claim
 they face death or torture if they were to be returned home.

They use Articles 2 and 3 of the Human
 Rights Act – the right to life and the prohibition of torture – to 
insist they must be allowed to stay.

The figures, released under the 
Freedom of Information Act, showed applications from nationals of 
Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Rwanda, Serbia and Sri Lanka.

Most of 
the cases are thought to involve those who have been living in Britain 
for a number of years. Critics are now demanding they are put on trial –
 or are removed from the country.

The figures, published by the BBC, 
show that in the 15 months from January 2012, Home Office officials 
researched hundreds of individuals applying for asylum who were 
suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Genocide: Some of those refused British citizenship were linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people were massacred and thousands more refugees died

In 99 cases, 
officials suggested they should not be granted asylum, citizenship or 
leave to remain in the UK.

However, of the 99 suspects, just 
three were deported. Even those who were refused asylum are likely to 
have remained in the UK under human rights rules.

MUGABE HENCHMAN

In 2011 it emerged that Phillip Machemedze had been  allowed to stay in the UK – despite torturing critics of Robert Mugabe’s regime in Zimbabwe.

He smashed one victim’s jaw with a pair of pliers and pulled out his teeth. But he was given the right to stay in case he faced ill treatment in Zimbabwe.

Machemedze, 49, earned £151,000 while working illegally in the UK for seven years as a carer for those with learning disabilities and for drug and alcohol addicts.

THE DARFUR MILITIAMAN

Mohamed Salim (right) claimed he helped ‘wipe out entire villages’ in his native Sudan. But he was allowed to stay here - because sending him home might put his life in danger.

The former fighter in the Janjaweed militia is living on benefits in a semi-detached house in Handsworth, Birmingham.

THE SERBIAN SOLDIER

Milan Sarcevic, 60, is accused of taking part in one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans war, the 1991 Vukovar massacre when 300 wounded Croats were beaten, executed and buried in a mass grave.

Last year, nine years after he came here, an immigration judge said evidence of his role in the atrocity was ‘not conclusive’, and said he must be allowed to stay because of his right to family life.

Earlier figures suggested more than 
700 suspected war criminals were identified by UK immigration officials 
between 2005 and 2012.

James Smith of the Aegis Trust, which 
campaigns against international war crimes and genocide, called for 
prosecutions  to take place in the UK.

‘There’s a cost and it is difficult to
 investigate crimes which took place in another country a long time ago.
 But if we don’t pursue those prosecutions, the UK could become known as
 a retirement home for war criminals,’ he said.

Michael McCann MP, chairman of a 
cross-party anti-genocide group, called for greater transparency over 
war criminals living here.

He said: ‘I have deep concerns that 
the Home Office isn’t being as forthright as it could be and I think we 
should be drilling down into these cases in order to give the public 
that security.’

In May, five Rwandan men were arrested
 in Britain over suspected involvement in the 1994 genocide in the 
country in which an estimated 800,000 people lost their lives. Three are
 still in custody but two were freed on bail.

Some of the men, who deny involvement in the genocide, have been in Britain for more than a decade.

One was found working in a care home in Essex.

In 2009, an attempt to extradite four 
of the men failed after High Court judges ruled there was ‘a real risk’ 
they would not get a fair trial in Rwanda.

One survivor of the Rwandan genocide, 
Beatha Uwazaninka, told the BBC that the thought of meeting a Rwandan 
war criminal ‘living happily ever after’ in the UK caused her ‘great 
pain’.

‘It is very sad especially for survivors who have gone through so
 much,’ she said.

‘If they cannot send the criminals to 
Rwanda, at least they can be tried in the UK. It is sending a message 
that wherever you go you will face the consequences of what you have 
done.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Anyone 
accused of these crimes should be put on trial in their home country and
 we will always seek to return them to face justice.’
