Donald Trump has been tricked into sharing a photo of notorious British serial killers Fred and Rose West with his 2.7million Twitter followers.

The 68-year-old was contacted on social media by Philip Bradbury, who sent him a message saying his late parents had always considered him a 'big inspiration'- but included an image of the convicted rapists and murderers instead.

The message was quickly shared on the multi-millionaire's feed by his media team but was taken down 40 minutes later after they realized their embarrassing mistake.

But hours later the tycoon responded, saying he may sue the culprit.

Donald Trump, 68, was tricked into sharing this photo of serial killers Fred and Rose West after he was sent a message by a follower saying the tycoon had been a 'big inspiration' to his parents 

Bradbury wrote: 'My parents who passed away always said you were big inspiration. Can you pls RT for their memory?' 

He included the photo of the couple who tortured, raped and murdered a number of young women and girls between the 1960s and 1980s. Some of them were members of Fred's family. 

Twitter users began to congratulate the prankster and within an hour it had been retweeted 2,500 times.

Some users also rushed to mock the businessman, with British comedian Dom Joly tweeting to Trump: 'They seem like lovely, kind caring parents, don't they Donald?' 

The team who run the Apprentice star's Twitter feed shared the message, but quickly removed it after realizing the mistake. The serial killers (right) murdered young women and girls between the 1960s and 1980s

Five hours after the original post, the mogul finally responded saying: 'I thought I was being nice to somebody re their parents. I guess this teaches you not to be nice or trusting. Sad!'

Rose West, Britain’s most notorious female serial killer, was convicted of ten murders in 1995 after remains of victims were found at the homes in Gloucester, England, she shared with her partner Fred West.

The crimes often occurred inside the properties with many bodies buried around the surrounding gardens.

She is now serving a life sentence at Low Newton prison in Durham, north east England. 

Five hours after he shared the post, he uploaded this reponse, saying it was evidence you should not be 'nice and trusting' 

He then posted another message saying he thought he was simply being polite by sharing the image 

Her husband was accused of 12 murders but committed suicide while awaiting trial in prison. 

Trump is an avid user of Twitter and constantly shares his viewpoints with his followers.

Last week he criticized President Obama's controversial 'coffee cup' salute he made during a visit to New York.

A follower asked him what he thought about the matter, he said it was 'terrible'.

However he has received a number of backlashes. Last month he said that US doctors who travel across the world to treat patients must 'suffer the consequences' if they are infected.
