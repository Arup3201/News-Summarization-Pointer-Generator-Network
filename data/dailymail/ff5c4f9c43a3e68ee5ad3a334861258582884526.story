Fifteen months ago, the planning for a mammoth summer Manchester United tour to Thailand, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong reached its final, most critical stage. A visit to Sir Alex Ferguson’s office.

‘We really were not sure he would agree to it,’ said one United source this week. ‘It was so big and contained so much travelling.

‘To our surprise, he smiled and signed it off in about four seconds. We couldn’t believe it. Within a couple of weeks, though, he had retired. He knew all along that he wasn’t going on it.’

New era: Van Gaal alongside assistant Ryan Giggs during the club's pre-season tour of America

Fast forward one summer and two new managers and United have been confronted with the thorny issue of touring schedules once again. This time it is for real.

Louis van Gaal’s repeated public utterances about the inconvenience of this month’s visit to America have caused more consternation in some departments of the club than key figureheads are prepared to admit.

Less than two weeks in to the job and already United’s new manager is causing feet to shuffle.

To managers like Van Gaal, the details are important. That is why on this tour, he has already tweaked the structure of a trip that was, interestingly, signed off by his new assistant Ryan Giggs during his spell as interim manager last May.

On arrival in Los Angeles last week, for example, Van Gaal declared that he wished his players to train in the morning, eat and sleep at lunchtime and then train again in the afternoon.

To make that work club staff had to book a Holiday Inn next to United’s training facility. Similar arrangements have now been hurriedly made for this week’s tour stops in Washington and Detroit.

Van Gaal has also been very specific about his players dietary habits. Menus have been changed mid-tour.

All this is a consequence of Van Gaal’s relatively late arrival at United after a summer spent with Holland in the World Cup. That can’t be helped and nobody at the club disputes the respected manager’s right to have things exactly as he wants them on tour.

Certainly mistakes have been made. Van Gaal and his players spent hours travelling to and from training in LA while the game venue, Pasadena’s Rose Bowl, was 90 minutes away. Here in Denver meanwhile, United’s schedule saw them face Roma in afternoon heat of 33 degrees on Saturday.

The underlying issue here, though is more fundamental. Van Gaal — along with other coaches of his generation — simply resents these increasingly arduous pre-season trips because he feels they interfere with the key business, preparing for a Barclays Premier League season.

At Arsenal, Arsene Wenger resisted long-haul tours for years. Having relented, the Frenchman spent a visit to Malaysia two summers ago complaining non-stop about facilities.

Respect: Van Gaal will be delighted to have a player of Robin van Persie's quality in his squad

All smiles: Van Gaal and Giggs will be eager to get United back on the trophy haul as soon as possible

This summer, meanwhile, Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho insisted on a short-haul trip to Austria having objected – quite understandably – to the three-week epic in the Far East and America he was landed with on returning to the club last summer.

United, though, have long since viewed pre-season tours as crucial to their business. They would not be the behemoth they are without them.There is a balance to be struck between the football and the money.

United’s chief executive Ed Woodward understands this and he and group managing director Richard Arnold would not try to force something on Van Gaal that he is rigidly opposed to.

But as somebody said this week, only half in jest: ‘If Louis thinks we are going to start spending a week at a European training camp every summer, he will be disappointed.’

One only has to look at some of the numbers associated with United’s current tour to understand its importance to a club who continue to thrive financially despite the weight of debt imposed by owners the Glazer family.

Each of United’s four games in the International Champions Cup here will net them more than £1m. Just as importantly, though, the club are committed to an astonishing 100 ‘engagements’ over the fortnight, whether they be player appearances or community initiatives.

Pedigree: Van Gaal will do everything he can to ensure Manchester United have success on the field

Outside the Rose Bowl last week, American fans queued unprompted for over an hour just to have their photograph taken in front of a United billboard. England striker Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, arrived in the US and went straight to meet a disabled youngster who had been waiting for months to meet him.

These commitments and dozens more like them do not, on the whole, make United any money directly but they deepen United’s footprint around the world.

They keep stellar sponsors like Chevrolet and AON happy, furthering a global ‘reach’ that is already believed to number 600million fans – half of those are in Asia – and sees them six times more popular around the world than, for example, the New York Yankees baseball franchise.

Aon, for example, the sponsors of United’s Carrington training ground, have 25 United engagements during this tour, involving 1,700 of their most-valued clients.

When a United tour is taking place, traffic to the insurance company’s website increases by a third and by 500 per cent on a match day.

Furthermore, their in-house experts believe that 34 per cent of their total business comes their way because of the United link.

There are other startling indicators, too. In Nigeria - where United played in 2008 - traffic on the roads is 30 per cent lighter when they are on TV. In Mexico, the birth rate goes up when Javier Hernandez appears in red.

Reunited: Van Gaal will pit his wits against close friend Jose Mourinho in the Premier League this season

Emulate: Can Van Gaal go on and become a club legend like former boss Sir Alex Ferguson?

Numbers like this do not come about by United sitting at home every summer. The club’s marketing and commercial strategy is aggressive, cutting-edge and, as a result, astonishingly successful. Therefore, it needs to be indulged.

On this tour Van Gaal’s players are wearing season 2014-15 shirts with ‘Chevrolet’ on the front. A deal worth £357m between now and 2021, the US car manufacturer want value and one of their privately-stated aims is for United to extend the company’s standing in Asia.

The same goes for United’s watch partner Bulova, the US company having already said that extending their profile in Asia was their No1 reason for signing their own multi-million pound deal with the club last season. 

Sports company Adidas – who will begin to make United’s kit again from next summer – also wish United to return to Asia and it seems unfeasible that another visit to key markets in South Korea – where the club have 300,000 credit card holders – Japan and China will not be on the agenda soon.

Planning for next summer’s tour will begin as early as October. It may well be America again in 2015, with Dallas, New York and Chicago the proposed venues.

Van Gaal will be consulted and already claims he has reached an agreement that will cut down the air miles. United, though, can do many things but cannot bring continents like Asia, America and Africa closer to Manchester. 

Van Gaal said this week that all he wants is ‘balance’ and that is only right. To get it, however, the famously rigid ‘Iron Tulip’ is perhaps going to have to bend a little.
