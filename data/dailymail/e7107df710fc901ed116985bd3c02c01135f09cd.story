Up in the expensive seats, Steven Gerrard looked down on another fruitless appeal for a Liverpool penalty and blew out his cheeks. This was one of those days at Anfield.

For all their improvement in the second half of the season, Liverpool are still capable of throwing in a performance like this from time to time. There are still days when the cogs in the machine don’t run smoothly, days when the absence of any kind of Plan B hurts Liverpool and hurts them badly.

Blackburn were terrific here. They defended brilliantly, ran hard and stuck to a game plan devised by manager Gary Bowyer to deny Liverpool the space between the defensive and midfield lines that their playmakers love to work in.

A week earlier here at Anfield, Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City found it impossible to plug those gaps. As a result, Liverpool’s Brazilian Philippe Coutinho won that game almost on his own.

Here, though, Blackburn found the key and, as a result, Liverpool ran out of ideas.

The visitors’ formation squeezed the life out of Liverpool while their two central defenders Alex Baptiste and Matthew Kilgallon cleaned up everything that Brendan Rodgers’ team did manage to throw in to the penalty area.

On the break, Blackburn were dangerous too. Without their much-discussed centre forward Josh King – who was injured - the Championship side relied heavily on the imposing figure of Rudy Gestede and he worried Liverpool’s back three all afternoon but especially in the first half.

Perhaps Liverpool were unsettled by a nasty injury to their own defender Martin Skrtel in the very first minute.

The Slovakian fell awkwardly in a challenge with Gestede and was treated for what looked like a neck injury for eight minutes. Happily he was okay by half-time and able to watch the rest of the game. No doubt he found it as frustrating as the majority crammed inside Anfield.

Liverpool were not dreadful. They were the better team. But by their own improving standards, their football lacked crispness and rhythm and as such they found it difficult to ever gather momentum.

Blackburn were actually the first to show after Skrtel’s injury and Gestede was the game’s most influential player for 25 minutes.

The manner in which he forced Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in to a mistake under a high ball seemed portentous while the dummy he sold Raheem Sterling to give Craig Conway a sight of goal on the overlap soon after was terrific. Sadly for Blackburn, Conway’s shot flew high and wide.

There was the occasional moment of cohesion from the home team but far fewer than we would have expected.

Liverpool may have had a penalty in the 19th minute when Kilgallon appeared to bundle over the largely ineffectual Adam Lallana in the penalty area. Did the defender’s toe just touch the ball first? Perhaps.

That apart, there were a couple of long shots from Coutinho. After his recent success from distance, nobody could blame the Brazilian for having a go. On this occasion, his range was set too high, however.

Skrtel’s replacement Toured did have the ball in the net in the 34th minute after a free-kick dropped invitingly to him six yards out but he was a yard offside. Then, during the eight extra minutes added for Skrtel’s injury, Lazar Markovic and Daniel Sturridge brought saves from Simon Eastwood. It was notable that they were the first two the Blackburn goalkeeper had been asked to make all half.

After the interval, Liverpool did build pressure. As Blackburn’s energy levels dropped, they found it harder to break.

Still, though, Blackburn had the best chance as Baptiste’s header from a corner in the 48th minute was brilliantly touched over by Mignolet.

Beyond that fright, Liverpool’s football was undeniably quicker, neater and indeed more progressive. Still, though, they found it hard to penetrate the wall of blue.

Indeed, all that Rodgers’ team really had to show for their efforts as the game reached the last 20 minutes was a shot by Sturridge that was blocked by Baptiste and a follow up from Coutinho that must have landed somewhere in the environs of Goodison Park.

Amid all this, though, there was a more convincing penalty shout, Sturridge going down as Kilgallon sought to impede his run with an outstretched arm. It was the type of penalty appeal that generally tends to be ignored. Heaven knows why. The use of the arm by defenders is not in the rules.

In the last ten minutes there were two more saves for Eastwood to make, one from substitute Mario Balotelli and one from Jordan Henderson. In all, Liverpool had 21 shots. That, however, suggests Liverpool were better than they actually were.

There were some bright spots, such as the performance of Emre Can at the base of the midfield. The German has a superb passing range and it will be a surprise if he doesn’t develop in to a very good player.

On this occasion, however, the glory was all Blackburn’s. They may have to be slightly more expansive when it comes to the replay in April but they deserved this draw and will relish 90 minutes against Liverpool at Ewood Park.

By then Gerrard will expect to be back in the thick of it. If he wants to get to Wembley for his birthday FA Cup Final, he is going to have to do his bit.
