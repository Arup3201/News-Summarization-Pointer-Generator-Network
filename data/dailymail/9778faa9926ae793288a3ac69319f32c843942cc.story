One of the most eagerly-anticipated video game releases has exceeded worldwide sales of £500 million ($800 million), its publisher has announced.

Grand Theft Auto V delivered the highest first day retail sales of any title sold by Take-Two Interactive Software, the parent company of the game's developer Rockstar.

Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight on Tuesday for the special launch of the game, which reportedly cost around £170 million ($275 million) to make and market - more than films such as Avatar.

Around a quarter of the poll participants who owned gaming devices said they were likely to buy Grand Theft Auto V, pictured, when the new consoles come out. While 22 per cent said they would pick up a copy of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Ghosts game

Online retailer Amazon sold out of the game on pre-orders alone.

Experts estimate it could generate £1 billion during its first year on sale, with gamers predicted to snap up some 25 million copies - breaking current records.

The Grand Theft Auto series has accumulated sales of 135 million copies since its 1997 debut. GTA IV has reportedly sold more than 25 million copies since its 2008 release.

The gaming site IGN.com polled 10,995 readers to ask whether they would take time off work on Tuesday when the GTA V goes on sale.

According to its findings, 5,059 readers - around 46 per cent - said they booked the day off as holiday.

Another 2,012 (19 per cent) said they would phone in claiming to be unwell while 35 per cent said they would wait to get their hands on the game.

Game makers Rockstar North have called one of the city’s 'druggie hipster' districts Hawick after the mill town about 40 miles south of their Edinburgh head quarters.

A Hawick councillor yesterday branded the use of the town’s name in GTA V as 'disgusting'.

Local councillor David Paterson said he feared it could 'destroy the reputation' of Hawick.

'Why did they pick on Hawick?' he asked. 'It is a lovely town.

'It is perceptions, it is how people will perceive the town.

'They might perceive Hawick in a bad light and Hawick is a lovely place - a lot of people are very, very proud of Hawick.'

Fans burst into the Stratford, east 
London, branch of GAME - one of the chain's 300 stores which opened at 
midnight - following a countdown.

They
were led in by Londoner Zohair Ali, the first in the queue to pick up a
copy at the flagship shop at Westfield Stratford City.

Mr Ali punched the air in delight while other gamers rushed to the tills to buy their copies.

‘I'm really excited now that I've got it in my hands,’ one fan said. ‘Being one of the biggest games of the year, it's going to be one of them I'm on for a long time.’

Kevin McFeely, from GAME, said the company opened as many branches as it ‘physically could’ on launch night.

‘Our customers really want to get their hands on this game,’ he said. ‘People are just really excited in terms of the things that they can do on GTA that they could never do before.’

One GAME staff member described scenes inside the crowded shop as ‘chaos’.

A similar hype was evident online, where GTA players posted images of themselves with the new game.

User Daniel Son wrote: ‘Got my copy of GTA! Ready to load up this bad boy.’

Dave Callan added: ‘GTA is going to make holidays to LA feel fairly mundane.’

Another user wrote: ‘I've waited patiently for five years but these past few hours have gone by very slowly. Soon I will have GTA in my hands.’

Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at financial spread betting firm ETX Capital, described GTA as a ‘British success story’.

‘The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cadbury's, Rolls-Royce... the list of some of the greatest British exports goes on and on,’ he said.

‘But not many believed a sandbox violent crime thriller video game series, Grand Theft Auto by RockStar Games, would become one of the latest entrants on that list.’

He predicted GTA V would follow the same blockbuster success of its predecessors in the series.

‘Like it or not, GTA is a British success story as it has catapulted British game developers into the spotlight over the past decade,’ he said.

‘It's also induced the growth of start-up game development companies in the UK who are looking to mimic the success of Rockstar.’

MailOnline's gaming expert Talal Musa awarded the game five stars: 'This is clearly a well-thought-out and intelligent title - a far cry from the meaningless violence many wrongly (and unfairly) infer from its 'Grand Theft Auto' label.'The visuals excel in both art design and graphical fidelity. From deep-sea diving to dog fighting in the skies, every inch of GTA V's world has been given equal, immaculate care and attention.'Every excursion is a surprise, and coupled with an improved check-pointing mechanism - you're now no longer punished for attempting missions in different ways.'Cars all 'feel' different, and have lost the wayward steering that plagued the last game.Missions no longer stick to the oft rigid GTA formula of driving somewhere and shooting something.'Stuff Magazine's Guy Cocker wrote: 'Grand Theft Auto V aims ridiculously high and despite those ethical missteps manages to deliver on all of its towering ambitions.'It’s a game that pushes the boundaries not only of what’s possible in open world games, but what’s possible on the current generation of consoles.'In GTA V, the incredibly detailed world, compelling characters and varied missions combine to create an experience that will live on in your memory long after you've finished playing.'

'Every excursion is a surprise, and coupled with an improved check-pointing mechanism - you're now no longer punished for attempting missions in different ways,' said MailOnline's Talal Musa

The Metro's David Jenkins added: 'A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay – this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play.

'Impossibly good visuals, in terms of scope and attention to detail. Excellent and varied mission design. Great car handling and much improved gunplay.Yet wasn't entirely positive: 'The story is as vague and meandering as usual, with not a single virtuous character in the whole cast. Gunplay could still be better and helicopters are a pain.'Keza MacDonald, games editor at IGN.com, said: 'Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America,' she added.'It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It's technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it's also tremendously ambitious in its own right.'No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.'
