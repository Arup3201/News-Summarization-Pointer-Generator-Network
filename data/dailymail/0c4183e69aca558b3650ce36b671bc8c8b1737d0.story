Frank Lampard’s career at Manchester City took a turn for the bizarre at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night as a young pitch invader managed to grab a ‘selfie’ with the midfielder in the centre circle.

Only minutes of the 7-0 Capital One Cup rout of Sheffield Wednesday remained when the fan evaded security to sprint on to the field to hug two-goal Lampard and persuade him to pose for a photograph.

The supporter was subsequently led away in handcuffs but City will certainly ask questions of their security ahead of their next home game against Roma in the Champions League next Tuesday.

City progressed thanks to two goals from Lampard and another double from Edin Dzeko, with all the goals coming in the second half.

Jesus Navas and Yaya Toure added to the tally, while Jose Angel Pozo scored on his debut for Manuel Pellegrini's side.

Real Madrid fan Ronald Gjoka spent the night in jail after running on to the pitch to embrace Cristiano Ronaldo during the International Champions Cup clash with Chelsea last year.

Two AC Milan supporters also entered the field of play in July to greet Mario Balotelli before being rushed off by security staff.
