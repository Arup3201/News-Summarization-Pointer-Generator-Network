A wave of bombings across Iraq have claimed the lives of at least 62 people, it has been confirmed.

The coordinated series of blasts included car bombs in Baghdad, an explosion at a market town and a suicide assault in a northern city.

The attack took the death toll in the country to 5,000 since April.

In the northern city of 
Mosul, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden car into a group of 
soldiers as they were sealing off a street leading to a bank where 
troops were receiving salaries killing 14, a police officer said.

The local branch of al-Qaida often takes responsibility for the assaults, although there was no immediate claim for today's attacks.

The bombings made today the deadliest single-day series of assaults since October 5, when 75 people were killed in violence.

Police officers said that the bombs in the capital, placed in parked cars and detonated over a half-hour period, targeted commercial areas and parking lots, killing 42 people.

Blasts in the Nahrwan district of the country saw two car bombs exploding simultaneously, killing seven and wounding 15.

Two other explosions hit the northern Shaab and southern Abu Dshir neighborhoods, each killing six people, officials said.

Dozens were wounded in the blasts for which no group has yet claimed responsibility

At least 62 people have been killed in the attacks which took place throughout the country

Other
 blasts hit the neighborhoods of Mashtal, Baladiyat and Ur in eastern 
Baghdad, the southwestern Bayaa district and the northern Sab al-Bor and
 Hurriyah districts

At least 30 people were wounded, in 
the suicide bombing Mosul. Police said gunmen shot dead two off-duty 
soldiers in a drive-by shooting.

The former insurgent stronghold of Mosul is located about 225 miles north-west of Baghdad.

In
 the afternoon, a bomb blast killed four people and wounded 11 inside an
 outdoor market in the Sunni town of Tarmiyah, 30 miles north of 
Baghdad, authorities said.

The string of attacks is the latest in what have been some of the most violent months in Baghdad since 2008

One attack killed six people and injured as many as 15 in northern Shaab, reports suggest

The planned nature of the attacks is considered a favourite of a local Al-Qaeda branch

Such co-ordinated attacks are a favourite tactic of al-Qaida's local branch.

It
 frequently targets civilians in markets, cafes and commercial streets 
in Shiite areas in an attempt to undermine confidence in the government,
 as well as members of the security forces.

All of the car bombings on Sunday in Baghdad struck Shiite neighborhoods.

Seven
 medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke 
on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to publicly 
release the information.

In
 Mashtal in Baghdad, police and army forces sealed off the scene as 
ambulances rushed to pick up the wounded. Pools of blood covered the 
pavement.

Today's deadly attacks bring the country's death toll to over 5000 since April

The force of the explosion damaged number of cars and shops. At one restaurant, the blast overturned wooden benches and left broken eggs scattered on the ground.

In Shaab, a crane lifted away at least 12 charred cars as cleaners swept away debris.

Violence has spiked in Iraq since April, when the pace of killing reached levels unseen since 2008.

Today's attacks bring the death toll across the country this month to 545, according to an Associated Press count.
