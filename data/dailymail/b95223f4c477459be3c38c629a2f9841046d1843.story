Washington’s ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun, said Google, Facebook and Amazon are playing by the rules on tax and shouldn't be demonised in Britain 

Google, Facebook and Amazon are playing by the rules on tax, are great American companies and should not be demonised in Britain, Washington’s ambassador to the UK said yesterday.

Matthew Barzun leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies, saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments.

David Cameron warned in October that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying UK taxes would be made to ‘damn well pay’.

Today the Treasury will publish details of a new ‘Google tax’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the UK pay at least some tax here.

But Mr Barzun told journalists in Westminster it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’ despite the fact they pay little, if any, corporation tax in this country.

‘I’m not the spokesman for any of those great American companies,’ he said. ‘These companies and other companies… are clever about using international rules that exist, as written, by the way, by all of us – that’s US government, British government – we make these rules and they are playing by them.

‘And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.’

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee which has exposed the extraordinary methods used by some corporations to avoid tax, condemned Mr Barzun’s intervention as ‘a joke’.

She said: ‘They are not playing by the rules as any normal person would understand it – they are playing around with the rules in a way that is totally unethical.

‘Playing by the rules means paying a fair amount of tax in the jurisdictions where you generate your revenues. These companies are not doing that, and to suggest they are somehow playing by the rules is a joke.’

Today the Treasury will publish details of a new ‘Google tax’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the UK pay at least some tax here: Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax

Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years

Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years. Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax. And Amazon, which sold goods worth £4.3billion in the UK last year, paid just £4.2million.

The firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules. But their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the UK.

Chancellor George Osborne announced last week that the UK will impose a new ‘diverted profits tax’ on corporations that seek to artificially shift their profits to low tax regimes abroad.

He said it would raise £1billion over five years. But experts warn that the so-called ‘Google tax’, whose details will be unveiled today, could prove fiendishly difficult to enforce.
