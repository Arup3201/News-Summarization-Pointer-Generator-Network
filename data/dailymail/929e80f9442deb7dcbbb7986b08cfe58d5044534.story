This is the moment an adorable teething lion cub gave up on trying to gnaw on a buffalo and instead tucked straight into his mother's tail.

The playful puss looked on as the rest of his 20-strong pride tucked into the felled beast, waiting until his mother had turned her back before he pounced.

The attentive lioness sacrificed her mealtime to entertain the tyke for around half an hour after he lost interest in trying to tackle the tough game supper.

Not exactly strict... The lioness and cub share a cuddle - even after his attempt to make her lunch

Adult lionesses share the task of raising their young, but have nonetheless been known to react fiercely when interrupted during meal times.

But despite this young cat's sharp nips his mother was happy to give her time over to cuddles and play, having already eaten her fill of buffalo meat.

Wildlife photographer Don McVee captured the affectionate moment while exploring Kenya's renowned Maasai Mara National Game Reserve.

I love you mum: Wildlife photographer Don McVee from Canada captured the affectionate moment while exploring Kenya's renowned Maasai Mara National Game Reserve with his teenage grandsons

Mr McVee, a retired Canadian Army veteran, said: 'My two teenage grandsons and I were on the last leg of a two week safari when we came upon a pride of lions resting around a buffalo kill.

'There were about ten adults and as many cubs. The adults were all lying down or moving slowly, having obviously eaten their fill recently.

'Some of the cubs were gnawing on the remains of the carcass. But one little cub gave up on feeding and spent the next half hour or so with his mother.

'I am primarily a landscape and nature photographer, but this experience in Kenya has whet my appetite for future stake outs.'
