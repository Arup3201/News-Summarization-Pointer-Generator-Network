Young women in the North East are drinking to dangerous levels more often than anyone else in the country, shocking new data has revealed.

Nor is the deep-rooted problem isolated to the region, with an average of 59 young people out of every 100,000 in Britain having been hospitalised after drinking.

Girls aged 21 and under in the region were fined for drunkenness more than women anywhere else across England and Wales last year.

Shameful: Under-18s in the North East are twice as likely to need treatment for alcohol abuse as the average British teenager

Endemic: An average of 59 young people in every 100,000 having been treated for alcohol problems

They are also more likely to suffer health problems after binging, with 118 of every 100,000 under-18s in the North East needing treatment - double the national average.

Health campaign group Balance is now calling
for an urgent review of alcohol advertising to help tackle 'harmful and 
hazardous' levels of drinking among young people.

Balance director Colin Shevills said: 'Our region is drinking too much from an early age driven by alcohol which is 
too affordable, too available and too heavily promoted.

'Although the 
Government's alcohol strategy aims to turn the tide against binge 
drinking, it is weak on a clear strategy around the marketing and 
promotion of alcohol.

'Our concern is that it will remain effectively 
self-regulatory. This is why we need to call on Government for change.'

Northumbria Police handed out 238 on-the-spot £80 fines for drunkenness to women aged 21 or under last year, according to The Sun.

That is ten times the number issued in Devon, Dorset or Hampshire.

Merseyside girls came second in the list of those fined for drunkenness, closely followed by girls in Lancashire.

More than 600 of the 9,450 people 
receiving specialist alcohol treatment in the North-East in 2010-11 were 
under the age of 18, Balance said.

The North West has the second highest 
rate, with 99 under 18s out of 100,000 in treatment, followed by the East
Midlands with 62 per 100,000.

In London, 47 young people out of every 
100,000 received alcohol treatment.

The Department of Health said it had 
set out 'radical plans to turn the tide against irresponsible drinking' 
and had given local areas powers to tackle local problems.

A spokeswoman said: 'Making sure young people understand about the harm 
alcohol can cause is critical.

'We will be launching a new way of helping
get this message across later in the year.'

Melanie Souter, from young people's 
service Matrix, said: 'Some young people who are drinking are doing so 
in a harmful and hazardous way with higher strength alcohol products at 
affordable, pocket-money prices.

'Alcohol advertising reinforces 
messages that it is either cool, or it makes you more attractive or it's
something that everyone does to have a good time.'

Balance is now calling for a ban on 
alcohol advertising aimed at young people.

It wants to prevent alcohol 
adverts being shown on television and in the cinema for under 18 
certificate films, as well as on social networking sites, and through 
alcohol sponsorship of sporting and youth events.
