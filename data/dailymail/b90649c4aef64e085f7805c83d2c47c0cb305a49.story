A young mother turned detective to get her violent boyfriend jailed after he avoided prison by faking a glowing reference.

Gemma Jarman, 24, was angry when Jesse Fleischer, 38, was let off with a suspended sentence despite admitting beating her up in front of their toddler daughter at the home they shared in Southampton.

Miss Jarman had seen how the judge at Winchester Crown Court had been impressed by a character reference from a hotel her boyfriend had worked at - a reference she knew was fake.

Attacked: Gemma Jarman suffered a broken cheekbone and tooth in the assault by Jesse Fleischer, 38

The intensive care nurse had suffered a fractured cheekbone and broken tooth in the attack, which left her and her daughter Freya, now two, 'living in fear'.

She told police that Fleischer had not worked at the Marwell Hotel in Colden Common, Hampshire, for two months, and went on to prove that the letter was a forgery.

Miss Jarman said: 'I was in court 
when they read out the reference and I knew straight away it wasn’t 
right - he wasn’t working there any more.

'He had been sacked on the day he battered me, and wrote the reference himself saying he was an amazing citizen.

'He
wrote that if he went to jail we would lose a great citizen of society 
and that he should be dealt with in society and not go to prison.

'I’ve seen the letter since, and it’s all spelt wrong, there’s no grammar, and it’s signed off ‘Thank you’.

'Jesse simply brought this faked letter in on plain A4 on the day and handed it over - I was absolutely disgusted that he was allowed to walk away a free man the first time, I couldn’t believe it.'

Miss Jarman found out no-one at the hotel had written or signed the letter and told the police.

She said: 'I went to the police and the officer I spoke to said: "That’s not right, I’m going to fight for this".

'They managed to get statements saying the hotel staff didn’t support Jesse in any way.

'That was lucky for me, because otherwise I would still be sitting here scared out of my wits.'

Winchester Crown Court had heard how Fleischer ‘completely lost it’ when Miss Jarman tried to break up with him on March 13.

Miss Jarman said: 'He begged me to stay but I couldn’t take it any more.

'He pulled me by my hair and pushed me onto the sofa and punched me about 12 times.

'I
was up against the wall, trying to get away from him, when he picked up
a statue from the mantelpiece and started swinging it around.

'I
went to get a cloth from the kitchen for my face and he started saying 
that if he couldn’t have us, his family, then nobody could.

'Freya was crying, but he only shouted "Shut up, shut up, stop being stupid".

'It was a terrifying attack and one which he subjected me to in front of our daughter, who was just 22 months old.

'He terrified my daughter and me.  We have been living in fear ever since, looking over our shoulders, fearing what he might do next.

'I just couldn’t let him get away with it.  I am just relieved he is finally behind bars and can live my life now - I have been living in fear for the last five months.'

Fleischer, who had pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm and possessing cannabis with intent to supply in May, was brought back to court.

The same judge, Recorder Michael Parroy QC, sentenced Fleischer to two years and four months in prison after he admitted perverting the course of justice.

The judge told Fleischer he would have been locked up in the first place without the complimentary reference that he had faked.

Miss Jarman said: 'The whole episode has been traumatising. I didn’t leave the house for the two months after Jesse attacked me because I was so in fear of him.

'When I moved to a different town to get away, he followed me, and I have a panic alarm fitted in my house in case he came here to hurt us again.

'I have only just managed to get Freya back into a routine and sleeping in her own bed again, for ages she wouldn’t step away from my side.

'I am so glad that he’s been put away at last.'
