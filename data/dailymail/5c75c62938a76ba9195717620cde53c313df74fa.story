It was snapped up for $8million when disgraced financier Bernard Madoff's lavish Manhattan home was sold off to compensate victims of his massive fraud.

Now the couple who bought the 'one-of-a-kind' property on the Upper East Side have put it on the market for $17million - making them a profit of $9million in the three years since they bought it from the U.S. government.

Pokemon toy mogul Alfred Kahn and his wife Patsy are hoping to sell the apartment on East 64th Street - which boasts 4,000sq ft of living space - for more than double what they paid for it in 2010.

The property has a price tag of $17.25million, according to a report in the New York Daily News.

Madoff bought the duplex apartment in 1984 and lived there until 2009, spending his last days under house arrest in its lavish surroundings.

The ponzi scheme fraudster is currently serving a 150-year sentence in a prison in North Carolina.

Broker Dolly Lenz, who is handling the sale, told the newspaper: 'It's a one-of-a-kind penthouse - I remember it well.'

Another broker described the property, which features soaring 11ft high ceilings and Palladian windows, as 'very grand'.

It features three bedrooms, a library, a chef's kitchen, and a wraparound terrace with views of Manhattan's Central Park.

It is a world away from Madoff's new residence - the Butner Federal Correctional Complex.

Madoff, 75, was at the helm of a multi-billion dollar empire when he ran his own finance firm.

But his high-flying lifestyle came crashing down in 2008 when it emerged it was being funded by the biggest financial fraud in U.S. history.

The following year Madoff pleaded guilty to siphoning $17.5billion from thousands of investors in a long-running, pyramid-style scam.

Along with his multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment, Madoff said goodbye to luxury properties in Florida and France, a beach house in Montauk, New York, and a yacht called The Bull.

The conman and his wife Ruth were also forced to auction off furniture, jewellery and clothes in a bid to compensate the victim's of Madoff's scam.

In 2010, on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, Madoff's eldest son Mark took his own life.

The financier had tried to hide the fraud from his family.

Following his arrest in 2008 Madoff was forced to confess that his Wall Street firm was 'one big lie' and amounted to nothing more than a 'giant Ponzi scheme'.

He posted bail of $10million and remained under house arrest at his plush Manhattan home.

In 2009 he was ordered to forfeit $170million in assets.

Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.
