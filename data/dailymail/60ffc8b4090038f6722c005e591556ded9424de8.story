Motorists had to be rescued from their cars after thunder storms and torrential rain caused flash floods across the South East early yesterday.

One of the driest starts to September on record ended dramatically when sudden downpours flooded parts of Essex during Friday night and yesterday morning, with more than an inch of rain falling in just one hour.

Floods of up to 4ft submerged cars in Southend and Witham, and parts of the A12 were blocked, while the rain also caused travel chaos across East London, with Tube stations inundated.

In Cambridge, punters escaped the worst but had to shelter under umbrellas or even resort to newspapers, right, for damp-proofing. By contrast, much of the rest of the country enjoyed balmy weather, to the delight of sunbathers in Brighton.

Forecasters said fresher conditions are expected today.

An ambulance was called to the The Cornucopia pub, Marine Parade to treat the woman who had fractured her shoulder after falling. Crews were also forced to pump out water at the Sealife Centre, draining water until after midnight. 

Meanwhile the roof of the Pearl Dragon Restaurant collapsed under rain water.  

But forecasters said the rain was likely to tail off by the end of the day, with fresher conditions expected on Sunday morning. 

Tony Baker, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'Thunderstorms and rain are likely to  rumble on through much of the day in London and the south east but it will gradually drift out to the North Sea. 

'There is a risk of showers throughout most of the day, it will be quite overcast and muggy with the rain likely to die out late this afternoon. 

'Much of England and Wales and southern Scotland is seeing cloudy, humid weather with spits and spots of rain showers in a few areas.' 

Mr Baker added the rain was worst in London, but a looming cold front will push clouds out later this afternoon to make way for a clear start tomorrow morning. 

'The cold front will push south overnight and leave a cleaner, fresher day tomorrow. The rest of the weekend is certainly a lot better.' 

Temperatures are expected to reach 22C in parts of the capital, with parts of the north east likely to be as cold as 13C.

Flooding in Southend trapped some motorists in their cars on Friday night with Essex Fire and Rescue receiving more than 100 calls in just two hours

On Thursday flash flooding wreaked chaos on travel in parts of London, with commuter services cancelled due to lightning damage on train lines. 

Lightning damaged equipment between Melksham and Chippenham in Wiltshire, with the lines between Swindon and Bath Spa/Westbury closed.

A limited replacement road transport was operating, with disruption expected to last until at least noon.

To the east, a lightning strike at Otford in Kent was affecting Thameslink services between Sevenoaks and Kentish Town in London, while Southeastern services between Ashford International and London’s Victoria station via Maidstone East were also affected.

Some trains between Sevenoaks and Swanley were diverted and were not calling at stations between Sevenoaks and Bickley.

A shuttle service was operating between Maidstone East and Ashford International approximately every 80 minutes between these stations.

In Exeter, Devon, lightning knocked out the telephone system at the Devon and Cornwall Police headquarters at Middlemoor. Emergency 999 calls were transferred to Plymouth. 

Also in Exeter, heavy rain before dawn caused flash flooding and affected roads in the city and outlying areas. 

In Dawlish, Devon, the fire service were called out to help after half a dozen properties were flooded by heavy rainfall.

Thunder and lightning woke many people in East Devon between 5am and 7am as the heavy rain replaced the sunny and dry conditions. 

Forecasters had warned that our Indian summer would come to a dramatic end.

Despite misty conditions and downpour in most of the country this morning, the weather in the south east cleared enough for revellers to visit Brighton beach in t-shirts

Dozens of rail commuters were stranded throughout the night when their train became submerged in 4ft-deep flash flood water.

The 10.45pm service from London Paddington to Swansea stopped near Corsham, Wiltshire, as it struck water at around midnight.

Emergency services were called to the scene at 1am but the 90 passengers remained stuck on board until 6am. A fleet of taxis turned up at the site where the stranded commuters were eventually driven home.

Passenger Chris Williams took to Twitter to document the journey and the spectacular electrical storms which swept through the area last night.

He said: ‘Trapped on First Great Western train outside of Bristol. Multiple lightning strikes and tracks totally submerged in flood water.

‘Well, I didn’t anticipate staying up for the vote. I certainly didn’t foresee being awake sat in the dark on a train surrounded by water. 

'Emergency rescue services boarded train. Checking we’re all well. We’re fine but would quite like to be rescued please. 

'Generally everyone in good spirits. Just no idea how we’re getting home.’

Problems: First Great Western said the flooding had caused significant disruption to other trains running between Bath Spa and Swindon

It is believed part of the train will be stuck at the scene for several days because some of the ballast holding the track in place has been washed away.

Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service crews at the scene said they found 4ft of water on the track when they arrived.

First Great Western said the flooding had caused significant disruption to other trains running between Bath Spa and Swindon.

It is believed the lines are completely blocked by water - cancelling, delaying or diverting trains.

A fire service spokesman said: ‘Shortly after 1am, Network Rail informed Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service control that a train had become stuck in floodwater at Pound Pill in Corsham.

‘Ninety passengers were on the train, which came to a halt in a cutting where water was up to a metre deep in places. A multi-agency response was put in place to resolve the incident. All passengers had been removed from the train by 6am and have been transported home by taxi.'

Astonishing scene as Clifton Suspension Bridge is lit up by lightning

Flashing into view, the world-famous Clifton Suspension Bridge is lit up by lightning as electrical storms rocked Britain overnight.

Photographer Pete Griffiths, of Redland, Bristol, was out walking his dog when the skies above him lit up with a spectacular thunderstorm.

He ran to a viewpoint near Bristol’s Observatory with his pet Spudley and captured the impressive display over Brunel’s landmark.

Mr Griffiths took a series of frames - but only one showed the lightning breaking high over the bridge, with storms brewing in the background.

The 34-year-old said: ‘I was taking the dog for a walk at just before 9.30pm and I quickly ran up there just before the storm hit Bristol.

‘I took a few pictures but this was the only one that got the crack of lightning. I was quite excited when I saw it.

‘It was a great storm and I managed to get home before it started raining.’

Flooding kills five campers in southern France after river bursts its banks

Other parts of Europe were also being affected by the severe weather - with five campers killed in floods in southern France on Thursday.

The deaths occurred after heavy rain at a municipal campsite in Lamalou-les-Bains, 50 miles west of Montpellier, which saw a river burst its banks.

Dramatic images showed a bridge blocked by trees and cars, and workers removing trees and debris, as well as evacuating people from their homes.
