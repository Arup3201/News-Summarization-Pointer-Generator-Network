Cecil Coley, 72, was playing dominoes with a friend after closing time at his son's florists shop when four masked men burst in, opened fire and demanded the takings

A disabled pensioner has today revealed the terrifying ordeal he faced as he stabbed a gunman to death in self defence during a bungled robbery.

Cecil Coley, then 72, was playing dominoes with a friend after closing time at his son’s florists shop when four masked men burst in and demanded the takings.

A violent struggle then followed which culminated in Mr Coley stabbing raider Gary Mullings in the heart with a knife he used to cut flower stems.

Mullings, 30, staggered outside and was found lying in the street outside.

Neighbours tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead in hospital with two stab wounds to the chest - one collapsing his lung.

Mr Coley - known as Roy - was later arrested on suspicion of murder but was freed without charge after he said he killed the gunman to save himself and acted in lawful self defence.

Today at an inquest into Mullings’ death a statement from regular churchgoer Mr Coley, now 74, who was too unwell to attend the hearing was read out detailing his torment. 

'I was terrified and intimidated and fighting for my life” he said in his statement. 'I was jabbing the knife wildly in the air. I was so scared I just pushed out and jabbed the knife again.

'I was thinking to myself that I was finished, that this was the last moment of my life.

'I was feeling weak and nervous and I passed out and collapsed.'

The hearing was told the incident occurred at 9.40pm on July 26, 2011, as Mr Coley who helps his son run the Feathers Frills and Flowers shop in Old Trafford, Manchester playing dominoes with 67-year old Neville 'Carl' Marrett in a back room.

The robbers, who were wearing balaclavas, were reportedly armed with at least two hand guns and possibly a knife as they demanded cash.

Mr Coley who is registered disabled and takes 32 prescription tablets, said in his statement: 'I heard a knock at the front door and when I opened it both of us were overpowered.

'I couldn’t force them off and they came in and both of us were hit and I was hit with either a first or the butt of as gun. A man went through my pockets shouting, "where’s the money, where’s the money"?

The man took £260 from his pocket before kicking Mr Coley in his side and around the hip area. The man then pulled off the pensioner’s wedding ring and a ring belonging to his daughter he was wearing on his little finger.

'I said to him, "if you want more money, lift me up". There was the shop counter on my right side that had some flowers on it and a knife.'

Mr Coley picked up the knife, which was used to cut flowers and prepare food and continued to walk into the rear room and switched on the light.

'I held the knife discretely by my side, the man didn’t see me pick up the knife.

'He was stood by my side as I got to the till. I pulled open the cash drawer and I spun round to the man.'

'I thought this was my only chance to get the four of them out of the shop. As I walked through the doorway I was aware of two to three males in front of me. I then received a blow.

'I then heard the noise of a gun being fired and I felt a stinging sensation on my cheek. 

'The knife was still in my right hand. I began to jab the knife and I saw the men going out the front door and closing it afterwards.

'I went outside, I was still holding the knife in my hand. I don’t know why this shop would be targeted by these people, I can only think it was opportunistic.'

A knife recovered at the scene. Mr Coley was quizzed and kept on bailed for six weeks until the Crown Prosecution Service concluded he had acted in 'reasonable self-defence'

Mr Coley was quizzed and kept on bail for six weeks until the Crown Prosecution Service concluded he had acted in ‘reasonable self-defence’ whilst fearing for his life and acted instinctively to protect himself.

In his statement Mr Coley said it was 'stressful’ when he was arrested and waiting to find out whether he would be prosecuted for murder. His health was affected and he battles with worry every day. 

A colt 45 pistol and an imitation Glock pistol was used in the raid. Police belive the blank firearm was fired close to Mr Coley’s face.

Mr Marrett who was knocked unconscious and had £40 stolen told the Sale hearing: 'We could do nothing.

A fourth man Nathan Walters, 26, was also jailed

'I thought this is it, I thought I was going to die. 

'I have got a bad shoulder so I couldn’t lift my hand to defend myself when I got hit - there was nothing I could do.'

Mullings’ two brothers Kyle Mullings, 19, who was also stabbed twice in the raid, and Joseph Junior Mullings, 24, and a fourth man Nathan Walters, 26, were all arrested.

Kyle was jailed for three years and six months, Joseph got five years and Walters was jailed for five years and seven months after admitting to robbery and possession of firearms. All three men were career criminals.

Recording an open verdict Trafford Coroner John Pollard said: 'Sadly yet another young man has met his death whilst involved in the murky world of knives, guns and crime.

'It is perfectly conceivable, despite his age, that being so terrified would cause Mr Coley to use a force strong enough to inflict those injuries.

'But in the course of that fatal stabbing, another man was injured and it is quite possible that someone else inflicted those blows. Who knows what happened in the heat of all the turmoil.'
