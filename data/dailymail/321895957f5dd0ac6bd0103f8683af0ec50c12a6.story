Town hall bosses will spend £210,000 of taxpayers' money on two new ponds for just 18 newts

Cheshire East Council agreed the plans yesterday after being told it must create new habitats for a colony of great crested newts that are protected by European law before construction on a £30million bypass can begin.

The move has been slammed by campaigners as 'unrealistic' when councils are being forced to slash budgets on frontline services.

The council already has to make £13million of savings this year.

Expense: Cheshire East Council has voted to spend £210,000 on moving 18 newts so it can build a new bypass

Rare: Great Crested Newts are protected by EU law and work cannot start until they are safely moved

Work on building the new habitat will 
begin later this month to ensure that the area’s newt population has 
time to settle into their new habitat.

A council spokesperson said: 'Great crested newts are a protected species and as such we are required by law to protect their habitat. 

'The £26.5m Crewe Green Link road is a major infrastructure project that will impact on their environment. The money is being used to create a suitable wildlife habitat, including the ponds, that will ensure the species continue to thrive.'

Plans for the 1.1km Crewe Green Link Road - running between Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent - went straight through an area dubbed ‘pond capital of Europe’.

An environmental survey of the affected area counted just 18 of the rare amphibians spread over a 500m area - putting the cost of the project at £11,666.66p per newt.

Construction of the bypass cannot go ahead until the newts are relocated to a new habitat next year.

The ecological study centered around wetlands on either side of Basford Brook, near the village of Weston, Cheshire - known as ‘the pond capital of Europe’ and noted for its wildlife.

Ecologists surveyed 30 ponds, marshes and swamps and found great crested newts in 14 of them.

The largest newt population discovered in a single pond was just six, although eggs were found at ten sites.

The discovery of the newts, which are protected by EU law, has already delayed construction.

The species are one of the most protected in Europe and one of the most endangered.

Population numbers are estimated at about 400,000 in the UK.

Habitat: The area between the A500 (pictured) and the A5020 is known as major home of the rare newts

Protected: Ecologists found newts in half the ponds and marshes surveyed and eggs were found at ten of them (file picture)

The
cost of creating ‘artificial wetland’ areas is expected to reach 
£190,000, with an extra £20,000 needed to cover legal and surveying 
costs.

A report to the council said: 'The 
construction of the proposed Crewe Green Link Road South will result in 
the loss of natural great crested newt habitat areas which in accordance
with protected species guidelines must be mitigated by the provision of
suitable alternative habitat.

'This is also a condition of our planning permission for the road.

'The
council will be able to claim some of the money back from the 
Department for Transport, which is providing 60 per cent of the funding 
for the bypass - but only if the road scheme goes ahead.'

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'This is an incredible amount of money to spend on relocating a group of amphibians to a new pond.

'For the size of this bill the authorities could have moved several families, not just a group of newts.

'Protecting endangered wildlife is important, but councils must ensure the costs of doing so are realistic and affordable to taxpayers.'

A Wildlife Trust spokesman said the area - between the A500 and A5020 - was known as a major newt habitat.

He said: 'This area is an important stronghold for great crested newts, given its long history of ponds and small wetlands. It may even be the "pond capital" of Europe.

'The creation of new ponds, especially if well-managed, is a tried-and-tested conservation technique to safeguard these rare amphibians.'
