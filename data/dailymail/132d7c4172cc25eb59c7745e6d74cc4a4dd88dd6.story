Many DIY sunscreens contain oils that actually speed up burning

Dermatologists are issuing harsh warnings against making your own sunblock, as hundreds of DIY formulas make their way around the internet.

Many bloggers who post the recipes claim that store-bought sunscreens contain harsh chemicals that could be as bad - if not worse - for you than the sun.

But doctors say there's no way to guarantee homemade concoctions offer broadband protection (that is, shield against wrinkle-inducing UVA rays as well as cancer-causing UVB-rays), or ensure that the SPF is high enough.

Ouch! Doctors say that if you make your own sunscreen there's no way to guarantee yourself protection from harsh UVA and UVB rays

New York-based dermatologist Whitney Bowe told MailOnline that making and using your own sunscreen is 'effectively putting your skin at risk for melanoma.'

'Sunscreen companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective,' she says.

'Tests are conducted in the lab and on humans to ensure they provide broad-spectrum protection and that the ingredients remain stable and active when mixed together and exposed to heat and sun.'

A quick Google or Pinterest search shows that many of the recipes call for various oils - like coconut, almond, rosehip and carrot seed oils - which can actually promote sunburns.

Joshua Zeichner, another dermatologist in New York, explained to Allure that oils 'can actually absorb light, making UV rays penetrate the skin more.'

'That has the same effect as greasing up with baby lotion when you go to the beach,' he said.

But even if you do use the right ingredients, like zinc oxide, cosmetic chemists say there is an art to mixing them together, and if you do it wrong - which chances are you will - the sunscreen will be ineffective.

So, despite all these warnings against it, why are bloggers still trying to make their own? They say that many of the store-bought brands contain harsh chemicals that can actually alter your hormones.

Their argument might not be completely without merit.Â 

Arthur Perry, a New York-based plastic surgeon and Adjunct Associate Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, explained on Doctor Oz's website that chemical sunscreens soak into the skin and get into your bloodstream.

Of the 15 chemical sunscreens that exist, nine are considered 'endocrine disruptors,' meaning they interfere with the normal function of hormones. Mr Perry said that the hormones most commonly disturbed include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and thyroid.

This can lead to early puberty and premature breast development in girls, small and undescended testicles in boys, low sperm counts, infertility, breast and ovarian cancers in women, and prostate cancer in men.

According to the Environmental Working Group, the ingredients that are most disruptive are: oxybenzone, octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene. A quick survey of the most commonly found sunscreens in a Duane Reade showed that almost all of them contained one or more of the above.

That said, is there a healthy compromise? Are there any store-bought sunscreens without harsh chemicals?

New York-based dermatologist Sherry Shieh says yes: 'The chemical-free sunscreens these days are excellent. They're fragrance-free and non-toxic.'

'There is no reason from a safety, cost, or time standpoint to make your own.'

Bloggers and doctors generally agree that mineral sunscreens are best; that is, creams where the chief protection is provided by zinc oxide or titanium oxide.

Brands that use these minerals include Honest, Sun Stuff, Alba Botanica, Badger, and Climb On.

If you do go the natural route, keep in mind that the SPF is usually lower - so you will need to apply more often, as well as every time you get wet.
