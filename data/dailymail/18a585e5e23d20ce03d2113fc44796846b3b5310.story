Forget candle holders,  dainty flowergirls and the dulcet sound of the organ, this is the bizarre moment a vicar presiding at a wedding danced down the aisle in front of the bride to the beat of 90s pop icons East 17.

The newlyweds persuaded their whole bridal party to cavort down the aisle at Holy Trinity Church in Horwich, Bolton, in one of the most unusual weddings ever witnessed.

Nick and Nina Makin were joined by their vicar, parents, bridesmaids and best man in throwing shapes down the aisle to 'House of Love' - all of which was captured on film.

Here he comes! The hilarious moment a vicar presiding at a wedding danced down the aisle to the beat of 90s pop icons East 17

Nina, 28, said she had been inspired by a mobile phone advert shown ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding.

'We loved the T-Mobile advert spoof of Wills and Kate’s wedding,' she said.

'Ever since I saw that I've always fancied giving it a go.'

The advert, filmed at St Bartholomew’s Church in London - famous for featuring in Four Weddings and a Funeral - was a parody showing Royal lookalikes celebrating their marriage in a rather un-Royal style.

Nina and 27-year-old Nick said their family, friends and vicar Stephan Fletcher were excited to be part of the novel ceremony.

'Myself and two of the bridesmaids have spent half our lives on a dance floor competing and so felt confident to pull it off,' she said.

Here comes the bride! Nina, pictured shimmying down the aisle with her father, says she and Nick get on so well because they've never taken themselves seriously

'Nick and I have never taken ourselves seriously which is why we’ve always got on so well.

'My whole wedding party are a group of comedians and so were instantly up for it. The vicar was in his element when I asked him.

'He actually spent half an hour showing me videos he’d seen over the past few years and was so excited to finally be involved in such a fun ceremony.'

The PE-teaching pair, who met at the University of Cumbria, followed their unique entrance with an Alice in Wonderland themed reception.
