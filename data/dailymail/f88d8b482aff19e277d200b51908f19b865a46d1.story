Hero: James Fayette battled a scissor-wielding madman who stabbed him and slashed the arm of his two-year-old son Luke ultimately fighting him off with the help of a good Samaritan

A hero father fought off a scissor-wielding lunatic who slashed him, his two-year-old son and three others on Tuesday morning on New York City's Upper West Side.

James Fayette, 35, who was once the principal dancer with the New York Ballet, battled with homeless Julius James Graham, 43, as he pushed his son in his stroller along the popular Riverside Park which looks onto the Hudson River.

Madman Graham still managed to slash Fayette across his chest and his son Luke on the arm, before a good Samaritan rushed to help and subdue their attacker.

'I'm no hero,' said the Samaritan, to the New York Daily News. 'The guy with the baby is the hero.'

The
terrifying attacks began this morning just before 8 a.m. when according
to NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly, homeless Graham, a 43-year-old 
Texas native who had been living in a Bronx shelter, began slashing 
people with as they jogged and walked in the morning sun.

According to the police commissioner, Graham first approached a 36-year-old jogger and stabbed her in the back. 

He
also attacked a 36-year-old man walking his dog, then 32-year-old 
Jessica Lipps, who running along the path, stabbing her in the neck.

Finally, Graham attacked Fayette as he was pushing his son in a stroller, Kelly said.

Graham was taken to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation.

The victims ¿ the child plus two women and two men in their 30s ¿ were all expected to survive, though one of the women was listed in critical condition

'The guy is a f*****g nut. He 
just took a pair of scissors and started stabbing everyone randomly, 
including a 2- to 3 -year-old child,' a law enforcement source said to 
the New York Post.

'He was running down the bike path, going from person to person, stabbing them with a scissors. He stabbed a man, he stabbed a woman, he stabbed a man, he stabbed a child. Whoever he encountered he stabbed,' a second source said.

Ben Loehnen, the 36-year-old man with his dog who was stabbed, 'thought he was punched in the stomach by the individual but he was stabbed,' said Kelly.

Deanna Koestel, the 36-year-old woman jogger is reported to be in a critical condition, while Loehnen is reported by the New York Daily News to be in surgery.

A Sanitation Department worker Sharita Fields told the Daily News that she and her supervisor ran to the crime scene after two dog walkers informed them about the attacks.

When they arrived, Graham was face down in the park being subdued by the good Samaritan.

'It didn't even look like he was coherent,' said Fields. 'I could see him on the ground. ... I stayed with the (wounded) girl who was inside the cop car. I noticed she was holding her neck.'

Witnesses heard screaming and a child crying at about 8 a.m. in Riverside Park along the Hudson River near West 65th Street, an elegantly landscaped stretch of greenery flanked by luxury residential high-rises

The stabbings stretched from 64th St. on the west side of Manhattan down to 61 St. and the suspect was eventually taken to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation.

All the victims of the attack were taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and the two year-old, his father and Koestal are all listed in stable condition.

Geoffrey Croft, a spokesman for New York City Park Advocates, called the attack the latest episode in a 'troubling trend' of violence in city parks.

He noted that a mother pushing a stroller along the Henry Hudson Parkway in Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan was attacked by a homeless man last week. At least two bicyclists were attacked a week apart in August along the Hudson River around 163rd Street, and two other people were slashed south of 60th Street a month earlier, Croft said.

Croft said the advocacy group has been calling for more park enforcement for years. Citywide, he said there are 80 security officers patrolling the city's parks, with another 80 recently hired. In the 1990s, there were 450 parks security officers, he said.

When asked about the spate of recent attacks, the police commissioner said city parks are 'very, very safe.' He said that although authorities are concerned about the recent crime, 'the amount of incidents of crime in parks is minuscule.'

Jason Santos, a 21-year-old biker from Queens, said he wouldn't use the bike path as much because of the most recent attack.

Edlin Pitts, a Manhattan resident who uses the path daily, said he had been cognizant of safety at night, 'but this happened during the day, and I'm concerned.'

'I'll just try to be more aware now — and I won't let this stop me,' he added.

Yellow police tape and park security on Tuesday closed access to the path. All that was left from the attack was the child's stroller, abandoned in the park.
