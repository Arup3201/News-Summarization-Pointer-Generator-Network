They might have been waiting for Michele Bachelet, the well-respected President of Chile, but Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia only had eyes for each other.

As they stood on the red carpet outside the El Pardo Palace awaiting Ms Bachelet, the couple, who married in 2004, exchanged loving glances - and continued to do so long after the South American premier had made her entrance.

Later, the pair stood side by side as they took a salute from the guard of honour laid on for Ms Bachelet who was making her first visit to Spain since being elected president in March.

The look of love: King Felipe and Queen Letizia exchange glances as they wait for President Bachelet

Romance: The couple, who married in 2004 and have two daughters, are clearly still very much in love

The encounter with the Spanish couple is not, however, her first brush with a royal since taking the helm in Chile.

In June, Ms Bachelet, a socialist, was left beaming after Prince Harry made a state visit to the country and met with her at the Palacio de La Moneda in Santiago.

This time around, the president, who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist, was left smiling after a chat with King Felipe, 46, during which Letizia, 42, looked on.

Letizia herself is fresh from a successful trip to Austria where she made a speech at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. 

Looking good: Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon in her grey suit and pearl earrings

Big moment: The royal couple look on as they take a salute from the guard of honour laid on for Ms Bachelet

Pomp: The welcome ceremony at the El Pardo Palace saw ranks of soldiers dressed in their best file past

Big arrival: Ms Bachelet was making her first visit to Spain since being elected earlier this year

First visit: Prince Harry, pictured here in Santiago, was the first royal to shake the hand of the Chilean president

Delighted: Ms Bachelet appeared almost as delighted to meet King Felipe as she was to meet Prince Harry

All smiles: President Bachelet waves to photographers as she's escorted into the El Pardo by Queen Letizia

The speech, which was made partly in German and in English, was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the Spanish artist, Diego Velázquez.

Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum.

The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe.

Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.

It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood.

On their way: President Bachelet appeared to be enjoying her visit to Spain - her first since taking office 

Dramatic: The smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony

Esteem: Unusually, the ceremony was held at the grand El Pardo Palace instead of the Zarzuela

All smiles: After bowing his head for the National Anthem, Felipe beamed broadly at the soldiers on parade

Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita.

Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary.

Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague alongside King Felipe, among her most recent trips.

Stylish: As is her wont, Queen Letizia cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the El Pardo's steps

Nice to meet you: Queen Letizia was greeted by Austrian president Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit in Vienna

Launch: She was in the Austrian capital for the launch of an exhibition dedicated to artist, Diego Velázquez

Striking: Diego Velázquez' most famous painting is Las Meninas, which was created for King Felipe VI
