Cowboy builder Patrick Feeney 'milked people for all they were worth' and was jailed for fraud and acquiring criminal property

A cowboy builder who boasted of being 'the top man in town' has been jailed for five years after overcharging confused pensioners by up to 600 per cent for his botched construction jobs.

Patrick Feeney, 49, targeted the elderly over a 15 year period pestering them to do building work at their homes then exploiting their vulnerability to hit them with vastly inflated bills and demand they pay in cash.

Two of his victims, including a 91-year-old, were escorted to the bank so they could hand over the money after being harassed for cash.

Another victim, an 81-year-old man was taken to a DIY warehouse to pay for materials and looked so frail and petrified, staff asked him if he wanted to sit down.

In his latest scam Feeney claimed £27,000 for work which was worth £6,000, £6,130 for building work worth about £1,000 and £2,090 for work worth £599.

During his reign of misery Feeney was on the run in Spain for three years where he hid from the authorities. He later claimed he had frittered the money away on a £200 pounds a day cocaine habit.

At Burnley Crown Court Feeney, of Colne, Lancashire, admitted three charges of fraud and one of acquiring criminal property. He faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing later.

Passing sentence Judge Graham Knowles QC told Feeney: 'You show not only a complete lack of humanity but also a complete contempt for your victims.

'Elderly, frail, confused and vulnerable 
people, whose ranks you may one day join, should be respected, should be
cared for and should be protected. But you preyed upon them.

'You milked people for all they were worth and used every technique that you found convenient.

'You are a practised liar who has lived a thoroughly criminal life. It is said you are remorseful, but I have to take a cautious view of that when it comes from your lips.'

Feeney first came to the attention of police in 1998 when he ran PNF Building and three of his employees had done some work on the home of an 88-year-old disabled woman who lived on her own for 27 years.

The value of the work was £4,500, but Feeney got the woman to part with £11,427.

He subsequently stole £900 from another old woman aged 84 when he had done some work for her and went asking for payment. He later declared to be 'the top man in Colne.'

But in August of that year he was locked up for three years and nine months for fraud.

He locked up again in 2007 for four years for further deceptions and was just out of jail on parole licence when he committed the latest offences in July 2009.

He jumped bail in that same year and fled to Spain before agreeing to return to the UK last year when a European Arrest Warrant was issued for him.

In mitigation defence lawyer Mr Richard Simons said his client 'showed genuine remorse' and apologised. The barrister added: ' It does not appear that the money was used to facilitate a luxury lifestyle.'
