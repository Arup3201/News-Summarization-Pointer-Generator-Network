The gunmen who attacked a shopping centre in Kenya, killing at least 67 people, probably died in the attack, an FBI official has said.

Al Qaeda-linked Al-Shabab militants claimed responsibility for the attack on Nairobi’s Westgate Mall on September 21 last year.

Aftermath: A previous NYPD report on he attack had raised the possibility that the gunmen may have escaped

Dennis Brady, the FBI’s legal attaché in Nairobi, said in an interview posted on the bureau’s website: ‘We believe, as do the Kenyan authorities, that the four gunmen inside the mall were killed.

'Our Evidence Response Team made significant finds, and there  is no evidence that any of the attackers escaped,’ he said.

A previous New York Police report on the attack had raised the possibility that the gunmen may have escaped.
