Prince Harry is to leave the Armed Forces within six months to pursue charity work with injured service personnel.

The captain in the Blues and Royals is expected to spend much of the next year in Australia, New Zealand and Africa, where he has links with charities.

Senior royal sources said Harry, 30, was at a ‘crossroads’ in his military career.

‘Although the military will always be a huge part of his life, he is at a point when he needs to make significant decisions about his career and the prince believes he can best serve the charities he wants to work with, particularly those helping service personnel, as a civilian,’ said one.

It is clear to many who work with Harry that since returning from Afghanistan he has been struggling to find a suitable long-term military role that can be combined with the causes close to his heart.

Kensington Palace declined to comment yesterday on reports of his decision to quit because the fine details are still being worked through.

The Mail understands, however, that he is likely to leave by the end of the summer. Before then he will spend several weeks with the military in Australia as well as representing the UK, along with his father, Prince Charles, at the 100th anniversary Anzac Day commemorations in Gallipoli.

Last year Harry devised and organised the Invictus Games, a remarkable Para-lympics-style event for wounded servicemen and women which attracted 400 competitors from 13 nations and was lauded as an unqualified success.

Despite that, some senior royal commentators question the wisdom of leaving the forces – which have given the once wayward prince so much direction in his life.

Many believe Prince Andrew’s decision in 2001 to leave the Royal Navy, where he had a distinguished career, caused some of the problems that have dogged him recently.

When Prince Harry leaves the Army, the Royal Family will have no senior members on full-time active military service.

Harry has served twice on the front line in Afghanistan since graduating from Sandhurst in May 2005. He was first sent out as a forward air controller in 2007 after his wish to serve in the infantry was deemed too dangerous to both himself and his men.

The angry prince was forced to return early from the posting when an American website broke the news blackout on his deployment. He then retrained with the Army Air Corps and was picked to fly the Apache attack helicopter. He returned to Afghanistan in 2012.

He left last year to take up a Staff Officer role in London to work on his plan to bring the Invictus Games to Britain. His move to the capital brought him back to his then girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. But when the romance ended, he realised he had little appetite to progress up the ranks.

He is now focused on working for the Ministry of Defence’s recovery capability programme. It involves working alongside case officers in London’s Personnel Recovery Unit and visiting recovery centres, Forces charities and NHS units.

A source added: ‘What he is doing now is helping him develop his knowledge of how the system works. The military will always play a very important part in Prince Harry’s life and especially supporting those who have served or are serving in the Armed Forces.’

Prince Harry passed the  qualification necessary to train at Sandhurst, in September 2004. 

He entered The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2005 and Clarence House announced that he was to join the Blues and Royals the following year as an officer cadet.

It was announced that had been serving with the British Army in Helmand, Afghanistan for more than two months in 2008.

He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant with The Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) and then begin training to become and Army Air Corps Pilot in January 2009. 

Prince Harry spent three and a half years in training and operational service with the Apache Force during his attachment to the Army Air Corps.

The royal  has undertaken two operational tours of Afghanistan, as a Forward Air Controller in 2007 to 2008 and as an Apache Pilot between September 2012 and January 2013.

During his time in the Army Air Corps he was assigned to 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment within 16 Air Assault Brigade and in July 2013, Prince Harry qualified as an Apache Aircraft Commander.

He was promoted to the rank of Captain in April 2011 and was also awarded his Apache Badge from the Officer in Command of his Squadron at the same time.

The Prince, who currently has the rank of Captain, took up a Staff Officer role in London  in 2014.

Warrior prince: Harry on patrol in Afghanistan

For as long as he can remember, Prince Harry wanted to be a soldier. Aged eight, he sat in a Scimitar armoured vehicle in combat fatigues and camouflage paint, beaming as Princess Diana took the salute at a Light Dragoons base in Germany. While his brother William daydreamed about being a policeman – so he could better ‘protect’ their mother – Harry yearned for active service.

This ambition drove him from Eton’s combined cadet force, where he narrowly missed out on winning the prized Sword of Honour, to Sandhurst military academy, and finally active service with the Blues and Royals.

Two tours of Afghanistan followed, including one as an Army Air corps Apache pilot after he retrained to fly helicopters. So his decision to end a military career just ten years after it began cannot have been an easy one.

It had, after all, seemed he was destined to become one of the few members of the Royal Family to actually earn most of those medals that routinely cover their chests. But life in the military represented a paradox for the warrior prince. Instead of helping him find the freedom he sought away from the heart of the Royal Family, it increasingly began to suffocate him.

The restrictions imposed on him because of who he was meant the top brass were not prepared to allow him the luxury – as he saw it – of the further front line posting he craved.

The Army proposed a desk job, a position which Harry is neither emotionally nor intellectually equipped to handle. He was, I am told, ‘desperate’ to stay in uniform but not at any price, and will now seek to find a new life concentrating on charity projects.

If alarm bells are not ringing at this woolly if honourable prospect, then they should be. For there are some uneasy parallels with another significant royal figure who abandoned a military career to seek a new direction – Harry’s uncle Prince Andrew, who has never found a meaningful role since quitting the Navy in 2001. Once a heartbeat or two away from the throne as Charles’s brother, Andrew has slipped down the pecking order with the arrival of a new generation of princes.

Now it’s Harry’s turn to slide down the line of succession. First George, and then in April – when the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth – another royal infant will vault ahead of him.

So at 30, and unmarried, Harry has momentous decisions to make about his future. Andrew was a divorcee and over 40 when he left the Senior Service, only to stagger from one disreputable episode to another in a kind of extended midlife crisis, culminating in the current scandal in which he stands accused of sleeping with an underage girl – which he robustly denies – and consorting with a known paedophile.

Harry's youthful indiscretions – underage drinking, smoking pot and dressing in Nazi regalia for a party – seem piffling by contrast. And as one figure who has been around him all his life tells me: ‘The difference between Harry and Andrew is vast. Harry is a nice guy whereas Andrew is arrogant. Yes, Harry has been a bit misguided at times, but he is intelligent enough to realise he must learn from his mistakes.’

When Diana was with him that day in Germany in 1993, she saw a confident figure better equipped for royal duty than William, and privately described him to friends as ‘good king Harry’.

What happens next to harness those qualities is crucial. Hugely popular with the public he may be, but that fondness may leach away if he returns to the sybaritic lifestyle of a party prince.

Harry stands at a crossroads. Now, we must hope this charismatic young man chooses the correct path.
