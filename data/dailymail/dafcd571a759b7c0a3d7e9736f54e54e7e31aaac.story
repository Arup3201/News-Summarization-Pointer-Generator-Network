An unemployed man with a string of previous convictions pretended to be 'Sarah from Aberaeron' in a bid to dupe a teenage boy into sex.

Lee Gallagher, 26, contacted the 14-year-old victim over Facebook and told him 'Sarah from Aberaeron' fancied him.

Gallagher, of Penparcau, Wales, then asked the victim for his mobile number so he could pass the details onto 'Sarah'.

Cover blown: Lee Gallagher, left, of Penparcau, Wales, used Facebook to target his 14-year-old victim, by telling the young boy that 'Sarah from Aberaeron' was interested in talking to him.

The 26-year-old told the teenager that Sarah wanted to perform a 'sex act' on him if they met up

Gallagher, who has 27 previous convictions but none for sexual offences, then started texting the teenager from his second phone as 'Sarah'.

He tried to arrange a meet-up with the boy and promised 'Sarah' would perform a 'sex act' on him if they met.

It was only when the victim's mother confiscated her son's phone after he was 'misbehaving' that 'Sarah's' true identity was revealed.

While she had her son's mobile, the victim's mother received a message
 from Gallagher, pretending to be 'Sarah', which prompted her to read the flurry of text messages.

The mother's friend then put the mobile number into an internet search engine - and discovered that it belonged to Gallagher.

It is not clear which website Gallagher had inserted his mobile phone number into.

Gallagher pleaded guilty at Swansea Crown Court to inciting the 14-year-old boy to engage in sexual activity.

Robin
 Rouch, prosecuting, told the court that Gallagher had first exchanged 
Facebook messages with the victim in September 2012.

But Mr Rouch said the boy grew suspicious when 'Sarah' tried to arrange a meet up.

When he was arrested, Gallagher told police he had not sent the messages, but he later confessed.

Mr Rouch said the 14-year-old now felt 'stupid, embarrassed and humiliated'. He added that he was now 'more aware of the dangers of social networking'.

Carina Hughes, representing Gallagher, 
said he and his family, who lived in a small community, had been 
subjected to abuse once it emerged that Gallagher had been arrested.

'Sarah': Lee Gallagher initially denied sending the text messages to the young victim but later admitted the allegations and pleaded guilty to the offence in court.

She said Gallagher was under the influence of either alcohol or drugs at the time.

Miss Hughes said no photographs had been exchanged and although Gallagher accepted he had been sexually motivated, no meetings had taken place.

But Judge Michael Burr said Gallagher 'needed guidance'.

Guilty: Swansea Crown Court heard how the teenage boy grew suspicious after Gallagher tried to arrange a meet-up by saying Sarah wanted to perform a 'sex act' on him

He was put under a three-year community order and was ordered to complete 250 hours under the supervision of probation.

Gallagher was also banned from contacting the boy or his mother and served with a Sex Offences Prevention Order, banning him from contact with children.

He was also ordered to register with the police as a sex offender.

Judge Burr warned Gallagher it was a 'tough' order and that if he failed to comply with any of the requirements he would go to prison.
