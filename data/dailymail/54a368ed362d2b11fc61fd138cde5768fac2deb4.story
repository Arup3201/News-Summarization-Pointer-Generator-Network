Twiggy Forrest's proposal would effectively dictate what people on the dole can and cannot buy

Millions of welfare recipients could be told what they can and can't buy if the federal government accepts a new plan.

A proposal to roll out income management to all 2.5 million people on working-age welfare - including disability support pensioners and carers - is reportedly contained in a review led by mining magnate Andrew Forrest.

Mr Forrest wants all welfare recipients including non-indigenous Australians to be included in the the scheme.

Only age pensioners and veterans would be exempt.

Welfare management already applies in the Northern Territory and is being trialled in parts of NSW, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.

Mr Forrest also wants all families receiving family tax benefits to have the payments directly linked to their children's school attendance, The Australian said on Thursday.

He believes technology exists that would make it possible to ban the purchase of certain products, including alcohol and cigarettes, with the value of quarantined welfare payments added to bank-controlled cards, known as healthy welfare cards.

A spokesman for the parliamentary secretary guiding the review, Alan Tudge, said the government would be releasing the 'comprehensive and ambitious' report into indigenous welfare and employment shortly.

The Australian Greens called on the government to reject Mr Forrest's recommendations, even though they haven't seen his report.

Ramping up income management was a 'deeply alarming suggestion', senator Rachel Siewert said in a statement.

The recommendations were highly punitive and reflected the top-down policy approach of the past that had consistently failed to deliver meaningful results, she said.
