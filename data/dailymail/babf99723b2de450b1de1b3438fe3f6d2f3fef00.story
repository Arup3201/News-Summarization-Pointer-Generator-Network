Billy Jones has joined Sunderland on a free transfer after rejecting a new contract from West Bromwich Albion.

The right-back, 27, was offered a three-year deal at the Hawthorns but has opted for the extra year tabled by the north-east club.

Jones has been one of West Brom’s most consistent performers since signing in 2011 even though he only played 22 games last season due to injury.

Looking out for his future: The defender was offered a four-year deal at the Stadium of Light

He said: ‘I’m really happy to be here and I'm looking forward to getting back for pre-season and kicking on.’

West Brom had been in negotiations with Jones since October and offered ‘vastly-improved terms’ but will now turn their attentions to other right-backs.

Director of Football Administration, Richard Garlick, said: ‘We’re obviously disappointed by Billy’s decision but wish him well in his future career.

‘With there being no guarantees that Billy would re-sign, we have been preparing for this scenario and will pursue the options we have been exploring in the right-back position.’
