A millionaire pilot and his girlfriend were killed when their private plane ran out of fuel, an inquest heard.

Cost-conscious Gary Vickers, 58, and Kay Clarke, 42, were returning from a shopping trip to Paris when their twin-engined Cessna smashed into the ground as they came in to land. 

Hotel owner Mr Vickers, described as ‘sensitive to fuel economy’, had discovered he could get fuel for 9p a litre cheaper in Britain than in France.

Killed: Gary Vickers (right) and his girlfriend Kay Clarke died when their twin-engined Cessna smashed into the ground at Hawarden airport near Chester. An inquest heard Mr Vickers bought less fuel to save money

Before taking off from Paris, he filled his plane’s two main fuel tanks to 244 litres of their 386-litre capacity. 

But he had underestimated how long the trip would take and one of the engines ran dry. 

There was enough fuel in the two spare tanks to cover the extra flying time – but Mr Vickers didn’t deploy them.

He was known for using a dipstick to test the fuel levels rather than relying on the fuel gauges, according to an Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report.

It also stated he had failed to take wind speed into account while plotting the doomed flight on a tablet computer. 

Wreckage: As one engine stalled plane veered to the left, going into a nosedive just moments from landing

Probe: Air Accident Investigation Branch officials at the scene. A report described Mr Vickers as ‘sensitive to fuel economy and aware of fuel prices at different airfields’. It found no evidence of a problem with the plane

This meant it had taken 45 minutes longer – using more fuel – than the two hours and 15 minutes he had anticipated.

The AAIB described Mr Vickers as being ‘very sensitive to fuel economy and aware of fuel prices at different airfields’. It found no evidence of a problem with the plane.

His father Gordon – a close friend of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott – had suggested the fuel gauges could have been faulty as his son was ‘extremely meticulous’.

The hotelier and Miss Clarke, who lived together in an £800,000 house in Chester, were returning from France in November 2013. 

Mr Vickers, who was divorced with two grown-up children, had phoned their destination airport, Hawarden, near Chester, and found he could buy cheaper fuel there than in France.

He added some fuel to the plane’s main tanks at Lognes-Emerainville airport near Paris. He also had enough fuel for an extra 45 minutes’ flying time in the spare tanks. 

But as the Cessna approached the Flintshire runway at 1pm, it veered to the left, flipped over and nose-dived before smashing into pieces.

Miss Clarke’s (left) mother Angela, 67, said after the crash: 'They idolised each other, and Gary (right) would never have put Kay’s life in danger.’ Mr Vickers had flown for 17 years and clocked up 300 hours in the air

Mr Vickers died at the scene. Miss Clarke, a former care worker, died in hospital from internal bleeding. 

The couple had been together for seven years after first meeting at his family hotel, The Mill Hotel and Spa in Chester. He also owned property in Andorra and Gibraltar.

The AAIB report concluded ‘the crash was caused by ‘fuel starvation which resulted from mismanagement of the aircraft’s fuel system’.

A verdict of accidental death was recorded yesterday by Coroner John Gittins, in Ruthin, North Wales. Miss Clarke’s mother Angela, 67, said after the crash: ‘They idolised each other.’

So he bought just enough - but headwinds made trip 45 minutes longer
