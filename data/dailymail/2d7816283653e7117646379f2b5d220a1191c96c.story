Towns and villages that allow fracking should be given a greater share of the proceeds, a Tory MP said yesterday.

As ministers gave the green light to potential shale gas exploration across vast swathes of the country, MPs said support in local areas would depend on the scale of ‘payback’ for communities.

Eric Ollerenshaw, a former ministerial aide in the communities department, which rules on planning applications, said the Government’s current offer was not high enough. This amounts to £100,000 per exploratory well and 1 per cent of all revenues.

Fracking is likely to become an important issue in next year’s general election, with research by Greenpeace showing that 31 out of 40 Tory target seats could be open to shale gas exploration. It could also affect 24 of 31 Cabinet ministers’ constituencies.

Parts of Mr Ollerenshaw’s constituency of Lancaster and Fleetwood are in the Bowland Basin, a region stretching from Cheshire to Yorkshire said to contain 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas – enough to cover Britain’s energy needs for decades.

He backed new rules designed to protect national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from development, but said ‘there are other issues still to be sorted’. One of these was protection of the water table, which some critics have claimed can be contaminated by fracking. The process involves pumping a mixture of sand, water and chemicals into shale deposits to force out gas trapped in them.

Mr Ollerenshaw said many of his constituents did not have a mains water supply and drew directly from the water table.

‘It’s a serious [election issue] in terms of getting it right, and also in terms of what is the payback for Lancashire,’ he added. ‘We still believe there should be a greater payback to local areas.’ In addition to the £100,000 per well and 1 per cent of revenues, ministers have agreed to let councils keep all the money paid in business rates by fracking firms that otherwise would have gone to the Exchequer.

It is thought councils could be in line for up to £1.7million a year for a typical 12-well site.

Campaigners have welcomed the rules restricting development in areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks, where major fracking projects will be allowed only in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Richard Hebditch, of the National Trust, said: ‘This is a significant change. We hope it will reflect a much more cautious approach that recognises the risks of turning some of the most special places in the country over to industrial-scale extraction of shale gas and oil.’

However, Greenpeace said the rules were a ‘sham’ that would create a ‘giant loophole’ for fracking across protected areas.

Spokesman Simon Clydesdale said: ‘Ministers can’t have their cake and eat it. If they’re serious about protecting our national parks, they should have made them off limits to shale drillers.’

Industry sources said there was concern that the new rules could act as a barrier to the extraction of shale gas.
