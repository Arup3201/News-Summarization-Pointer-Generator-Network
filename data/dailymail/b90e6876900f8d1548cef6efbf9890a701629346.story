A middle school biology teacher who was fired after students discovered she had starred in porn films has lost her bid to return to the classroom.

Stacie Halas, 32, was sacked from Haydock Intermediate School in Oxnard, California, after students downloaded clips onto their smartphones of her appearing in films such as 'Big Sausage Pizza' and presented them to school officials.

Halas, who appeared in the films under the name Tiffany Six, was fired from her job as
a science teacher after the video surfaced in March but had hoped to make a return to the classroom. She lost an appeal against the decision on Tuesday.

Porn past: Stacie Halas, 32, who appeared in porn films under the name Tiffany Six, was sacked from her job as a science teacher after students showed school officials clips of her on their smartphones

She claimed she had only starred in the blue movies during an eight-month period from 2005 to 2006 because of 
financial problems after her boyfriend abandoned her and never when she was teaching.

But a three-judge panel unanimously decided her porn past meant she was unfit for the classroom.

Writing in a 46-page decision by the Commission on Professional Competence, Judge Julie Cabos-OwenÂ  said Halas had been continually deceitful about her nine-month career in porn before she went to work at the school.

Judge Cabos-Owen wrote: 'Although (Halas') pornography career has concluded, the ongoing availability of her pornographic materials on the Internet will continue to impede her from being an effective teacher and respected colleague.'

Her lawyer Richard Schwab said Halas had tried to be honest but was embarrassed by her previous experience in the adult industry.

'Miss Halas is more than just an individual fighting for her job as a teacher,' he said Tuesday. 'I think she's representative of a lot of people who may have a past that may not involve anything illegal or anything that hurts anybody.'

Starring role: District officials said Halas's past - and the fact many students have seen pictures and video footage of the teacher - would always be a distraction

Halas claimed she had only worked in the porn industry over a period of nine months after he boyfriend abandoned her

Student claims that their teacher was 
moonlighting as a porn star were initially dismissed after school 
officials said they couldn't find any images of her on the Internet - 
but they were using the school's computers, which don't allow access to 
porn.

In hearings, former assistant principal Wayne Saddler testified that at the start of a sex video, Halas talked about being a teacher and he felt her effectiveness in the classroom had been compromised.

After rumors of her performance surfaced, profanity was etched on Halas' classroom window, a teacher testified.

District superintendent Jeff Chancer applauded the commission's ruling.

Halas' decision to 'engage in pornography was incompatible with her responsibilities as a role model for students and would present an insurmountable, recurring disruption to our schools should she be allowed to remain as a teacher,' Chancer said in a statement.
