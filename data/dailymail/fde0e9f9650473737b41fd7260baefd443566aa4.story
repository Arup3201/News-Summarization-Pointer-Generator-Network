A suspected stalker threatened to decapitate a lingerie model known as Philadelphia's 'hottest blonde', it is claimed.

Luis Plascencia, 47, sent the barrage of hate-filled messages through Facebook and e-mail to Kourtney Reppert, it is alleged.

The 26-year-old Playboy hostess was so terrified she hired security guards for her birthday party at a nightclub in April.

Plascencia was arrested at his home in Chicago and held without a bond. He will appear in court today to face the charges which carry a maximum of five years in prison.

Threats: Lingerie model Kourtney Reppert, 26, allegedly received a barrage of disturbing emails and Facebook messages from Luis Plascencia

One message is claimed ho have said: 'I hope you die in an automobile accident and [it] crushes your ugly face through the windshield and a large piece of glass cuts your throat.'

Plascencia is alleged to have later used a computer at the Chicago Public Library to send  emails threatening to cut Reppert's head off and chop her parents 'to pieces with a hand saw'  unless she stopped modelling.

The FBI affidavit states that Plascencia lived with his mother and sent messages using a number of different email addresses, according to LA Weekly.

He was apparently angry that the model was posing semi-nude, in lingerie and bikinis.

But in one instance Plascencia is alleged to have impersonated a photographer in an attempt to get Miss Reppert to pose nude for him.

Another alleged message added: 'I'm going to stab you in the f*****g heart and cut your head off'.

He is also said to have branded her a 'slut', a 'whore', a 'gutless b***h' and a 'fat ass'.

The charges claim that Plascencia also sent Miss Reppert a CD containing 234 photographs of her that he had collected.

According to detectives, Plascencia posted letters to Reppert's former address, and those of her father and stepmother.

Another email excerpted in the criminal complaint stated: 'I warned you before about doing this and will continue my wrath until you step down as a model go back to college and move back near your family in Philly. I know where you are most of the time.'

Reppert told authorities she was so disturbed by the messages that she hired bodyguards to go out with her in public. Security guards were also used to protect her birthday party in April at a nightclub.

The model claimed that a private detective she employed confronted Plascencia about the suspected stalking. He is said to have apologised before deleting files on his computer.

But when police raided his apartment they are said to have found CDs containing images of the Miss Reppert set to music.

Reppert tweeted that she initially declined to speak publicly about the allegations and was 'disappointed' her identity had been revealed through the FBI files.

'This has been a very stressful time for me and my family,' Reppert wrote on Facebook yesterday. 'I will remain positive.'

The glamour model moved from Philadelphia to LA last year and has since worked as a hostess at the Playboy mansion.

Philladelphia radio hosts Steve Morrison and Preston Elliot also rated her the state's 'hottest blonde' on their 'Preston and Steve' show  on 93.3 WMMR.

According to her website, she also studied business and marketing at college and is the CEO and founder of Bombshell Marketing.
