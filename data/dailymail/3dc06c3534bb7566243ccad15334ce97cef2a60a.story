Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie has rubbished claims of a Canberra makeover, and confessed she arrived in parliament with a wardrobe made up entirely of op-shop purchases.

Ms Lambie said her thrift was the result of more than $20,000 of debt, which meant she was not able to splash out on her clothing. 

However, the fiery politician said she has splashed out on at least one luxury, admitting to getting botox injections in her back and face, according to the Daily Telegraph.

'I haven't had a makeover,' Senator Lambie said, when asked if she had undergone a make-over since she arrived in Canberra.

'This is how it works. When I first came in, because I had sold my house and used every last bit of money I had, Clive Palmer in the end helped me get over the line, I had nothing left.

'It took a couple of months to get back on my feet and the only things in my wardrobe I pretty much got from Vinnies over the last two years. It would have only been $3 to $4 apiece.

'You know, if you want to look nice and you're in the public spotlight, that's just part of the job,' Ms Lambie said

'So I've just basically gone out and bought some new clothes. I've got girlfriends. One of them owns the shop in Davenport. I try to keep it local. So I thought, 'bugger it, I will just do it at Christmas time when they've got all their sales and stuff'.

'I have a heap of Botox in my back, right, so every now and again I put some in my crow's feet.'

'You know, if you want to look nice and you're in the public spotlight, that's just part of the job.'

Ms Lambie was no stranger to colourful accessories during her early parliamentary days, with bright scarves and jackets a staple of her wardrobe when she first stepped foot in the senate.
