Former President George W. Bush made an unannounced visit to the 9/11 museum on Sunday where he walked in silent contemplation among the exhibits.

Bush, who was in office during the terrorist attacks 13 years ago, spent an hour at the Ground Zero site in lower Manhattan.

He arrived at 6pm, while the museum was still open to the public, accompanied by his security team.

Onlookers said that former president George W Bush arrived quietly at the 9/11 museum on Sunday night and spent an hour look at the exhibits. He reportedly was particularly taken with 'The Final Column' (pictured in stock image from May 2014)

According to the New York Post, some fellow museum visitors recognized the former commander-in-chief but respectfully did not approach him. 

Bush shook hands with police officers at the site and appeared moved by what he had seen, according to one cop. 

In particular, the former president, spent time viewing The Final Column - the last steel beam removed from Ground Zero at the end of the nine-month recovery effort in 2002.

The artifact is covered in pictures  of the fallen along with messages of hope and love from emergency responders and rescue crews.

It was President Bush's first trip to the museum at Ground Zero. 

He was noticeably absent from the National September 11 Memorial & Museum dedication in May which was attended by President Obama and former president Bill Clinton.

Instead, Bush's office issued a statement saying he and wife Laura 'thank all those who played a role in creating this inspiring tribute, and we send our best wishes to those gathered to dedicate it'. 

The September 11 attacks on the U.S. claimed the lives of 2,996 people.

A few days after two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, Bush stood on top of rubble on the site, and using a bullhorn, reassured Americans.

That bullhorn is in the museum as part of a loan from the the Bush Presidential Library.
