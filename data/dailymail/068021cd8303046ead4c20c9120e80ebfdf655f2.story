A Dutch man on his honeymoon escaped death after falling 4,000 feet off a cliff - by landing on a tree top.

Mamitho Lendas was visiting the World's End mountain when he stepped back to take a picture of his bride, and plummeted off the edge.

The 35-year-old groom was rescued by Sri Lankan troops and is the first person in history ever to survive the fall.

Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera, a spokesman for the Sri Lankan Army, said: 'He was extremely lucky because he fell on top of a tree about 130 feet from the top.

'He is the first person to survive a fall from World's End.' 

Troops used ropes to reach Mr Lendas and winch him to safety. Some 40 soldiers were involved in the initial rescue which was later backed by a military helicopter.

Mr Lendas had to be evacuated from the area on the shoulders of troops, who carried him over a distance of three miles to the nearest point at which he could be driven to hospital.

Mr Lendas, who suffered no major injuries, told reporters that the ordeal 'was very scary and very painful as well.

'Then I sat there for three and a half hours - the longest three and a half hours of my life.'

The World's End cliff is the main attraction at the Horton Plains nature reserve in central Sri Lanka and is a key tourist attraction in the country. 

In 2011, Christopher Pilther, a 53-year-old Australian, fell to his death off the mountain top whilst visiting on holiday.
