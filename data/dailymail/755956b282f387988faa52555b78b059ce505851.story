Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson has whipped up a frenzy over his views on same sex marriage and bakery. 

Speaking about same-sex marriage at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines, the pediatric neurosurgeon said he had a problem 'when people try to force people to act against their beliefs because they say "they're discriminating against me".

'So they can go right down the street and buy a cake, but no, let's bring a suit against this person because I want them to make my cake even though they don't believe in it. 

'Which is really not all that smart because they might put poison in that cake,' Dr Carson, who is on the record opposing same-sex marriage, said according to The Hill.

Republican Ben Carson said that bringing a lawsuit against a baker who doesn't want to make you a cake because they have different beliefs 'is really not all that smart because they might put poison in that cake'

The remarks earned the politician, who lacks the name recognition of other Republicans thought to be angling for a run at the White House, widespread attention online.

Many social media users were shocked by the statements, which they interpreted as joking about Christian bakers killing gay and lesbian couples preparing for their weddings.

Dr Carson later went on The Kelly File to talk about his performance at the weekend's Iowa event, which anchor Megyn Kelly praised beyond the cake comment.

'Never make your waiter or your chef angry because you don't know what they're going to put in your food,' the former professor said when asked about the event.

He maintained that those offended were taking issue where there was none.

While Dr Carson tried to distance himself from controversy, gay wedding cakes have repeatedly become a political issue and several bakeries have been challenged by customers who were refused service.

Last year the Colorado Civil Rights Commission upheld a ruling saying that a Christian baker discriminated against couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012.

The baker refused to sell them a cake to celebrate their wedding in Massachusetts because he didn't believe in same-sex marriage.

Multiple bakeries in Colorado have come under investigation after refusing to make cakes based on the customers' views of same-sex marriage

Marjorie Silva, who supports gay unions, is now under investigation by the Colorado's Department of Regulatory Agencies for refusing to make a cake for a man opposed to them, KUSA reported.

Mrs Silva was preparing to make cakes shaped like Bibles when customer Bill Jack told her to paint the desserts with the phrase 'God hates gays' and a picture of two men with a big X over them.

She said she refused to make the cake because Mr Jack's requests were 'discriminatory and hateful'. 

Dr Carson's view of gay marriage previously also caused controversy in 2013. 

He said that he supported a traditional definition of marriage and lumped those for same-sex marriage together with that group such as the North American Man/Boy Love Association and those in support of bestiality.

The doctor later said that he apologized to anyone offended. 

Some in the Republican presidential nominee pool are thought to be avoiding discussion of gay marriage because of changing attitudes on the topic.
