Some of the very first cells to form life on Earth could be hiding on the moon.

This is according to British scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows.

They claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment - a time when Earth was bombarded by asteroids, and chunks of its material were thrown into space.

'Unlike the Earth, the moon has been geologically quiet for billions of years, meaning there is a good chance these organic and volatile records remain relatively intact,' Richard Matthewman from Imperial College London told Maddie Stone at Motherboard.

Life began on Earth around four billion years ago, but the planet's geologic record only goes back 3.8 billion years.

The cells and molecules that formed before have been erased through plate tectonics.

Scientists want to find them as they could provide crucial evidence to how organic molecules transformed into life systems.

In April, physicists tested what would happen if rock containing microscopic fossils from Earth were to be fired into space and smash into the lunar surface.

None of the fossils survived perfectly intact in the University of Kent study, but being able to recover anything at all was still promising for the scientists.

The latest study, however, shows that these fossils can survive and now researchers are attempting to find out exactly how long.

'We think a lava flow might be a good way to do that,' Professor Matthewman told Motherboard said.

The Imperial College team heated a range simple organic compounds and complex polymers up to 700°C in a vacuum.

They also added JCS-1 - a synthetic mixture of minerals the mimic's the lunar surface.

Without JCS-1, the organic materials were destroyed. But in its presence, they were able to survive the intense heat.

However, so far, no one has found an Earth meteorite on the moon.

Professor Matthewman said that if scientists found a series of lava flows with terrestrial meteorites inside, they could find the first appearance of recognisable life.

Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life. They say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents (stock image shown) in the early Earth, billions of years ago

One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape.

Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind.

But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today.

The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature.

They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began.

One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. 

These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form.

Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth.

But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA.
