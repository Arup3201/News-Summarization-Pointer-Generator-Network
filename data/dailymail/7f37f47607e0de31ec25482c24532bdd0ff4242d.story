Momentarily blinded by the glare of daylight, an Oklahoma resident emerges from his cellar to face a scene of unimaginable devastation.

The unnamed householder who filmed the footage, known only as Jay,  had been cowering in the darkness of his basement with his family as a monstrous tornado barrelled through his hometown destroying all that lay in its path.

Still clearly terrified by their ordeal, a woman out of shot begs him: 'Jay, if it is still windy I want you to stay.'

As he creaks open the cellar door he is confronted by a scene that is more like an apocalypse than the aftermath of a storm.

But this swirling vortex of destruction was far more than just a storm.

'God giveth and God taketh away,' says Jay as he turns the camera on the remains of his home, now little more than a pile of bricks and timber.

'It was like the apocalypse,' another resident in the area said.

'Apocalypse': The huge tornado with winds of up to 200 miles per hour tore through the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore

The huge tornado with winds of up to 200 miles per hour tore through the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore on Monday, ripping up at least two schools and leaving a wake of tangled wreckage as a dangerous storm system threatened as many as 10 U.S. states.

Aerial video showed tracts of homes destroyed, cars tossed about and piled atop one another, and at least one building on fire. Rescue workers were pulling third-graders from a severely damaged elementary school in Moore, a KFOR television reporter said from the scene, and aerial video showed first responders sifting through the rubble left behind.

The National Weather Service assigned the twister a preliminary ranking of EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, meaning the second most powerful category of tornado with winds up to 200 mph.

The strength of the storm was able to unlatch cellar doors where residents sought refuge from the tornado.

'We thought we died because we were inside the cellar door, we locked the cellar door once we saw it coming, it got louder and next thing you know is you see the latching coming undone and we couldn't reach for it and it ripped open the door and just glass and debris started slamming on us and we thought we were dead to be honest,' said Moore resident Ricky Stover said.

Stover said with the doors swung open they watched as his neighbors house was torn to shreds.
