Admission: Jon Snow, pictured in costume at a charity event in May 2007, said he had eaten a 'strawberry flan' spiked with LSD when he was about 22

Jon Snow has claimed he once drove on a motorway while high on LSD.

The Channel 4 News veteran revealed the incident on his blog, coincidentally only hours ahead of presenting the controversial television show, Drugs Live, last night.

Snow, 64, said he had eaten a ‘delicious strawberry flan’ spiked with the hallucinogenic drug at a party in Oxford when he was about 22.

He said: ‘I had two slices. It wasn’t long before I felt the need to go home.

‘Five of us had driven in a Mini, from London. We got back into the car and set off down the M40. Almost immediately I seemed to be being assaulted by the white lines, flashing into my head. As I approached the first bridge over the road I became convinced that the car was too big to pass through it. I pulled over.’

Mr Snow said the only person who had not eaten the flan drove for the remainder of the journey.

The drug may also have affected Mr Snow’s memory, because although the M40 opened in 1967, the London to Oxford stretch was not completed until 1974.

Appearance: Drugs Live, which continues tonight, aims to show what happens when 25 volunteers are given the drug ecstasy in hospital conditions

In 1969-70, when Mr Snow would have been ‘about 22’, the motorway extended only from Beaconsfield (Junction 2) to Stokenchurch (Junction 5).

He added on his blog: ‘By the time we reached my flat above the drug dependents’ day centre where I worked, I was all over the place. We had deliberated on the journey and concluded that we were on a trip in which our tyres did not connect with any road surface.’

Drugs Live, which continues tonight, aims to show what happens when 25 volunteers are given the drug ecstasy in hospital conditions.

Mr Snow, who said he has ‘never tried’ the drug, described the programme as ‘eye-opening stuff’ and said he was ‘honoured to be a part of it’.
