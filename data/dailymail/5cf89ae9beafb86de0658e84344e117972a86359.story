Lucky: Isidro Hernandez Tovar, 70, survivied the deadliest vehicle accident in U.S. history when he was 19-years-old and working as a laborer in California

A 70-year-old man who survived the deadliest vehicle accident in U.S. history spoke to the press for the first time since a train rammed into a bus full of Mexican laborers in 1963.

After spending two months in the hospital, Isidro Hernandez Tovar, then 19, returned to his home in Jalisco, Mexico and put the scarring day behind him.

Tovar only came forward after reading an article in the Monterey Herald last week about Salvador Flores Barragan - the man believed to be the sole-survivor of the crash.

So he called up the Herald and said: 'I'm also a survivor'. 

Tovar was in the U.S. working in the Bracero program when the crash happened.

The
 Bracero program was establed in 1942 and ran until 1964, bringing some 5
 million foreign workers to the country to supplement labor shortages 
caused by World War II - many of them Mexican nationals.

Tovar
 says he had to pay 700 pesos to sign up for the program, a fee  he was 
only able to afford once starting work in California.

'Frankly,
 they treated you like a little animal, they sent you from here to 
there,' he said. '(The employers) were the ones who did everything. They
 would tell you to either go to Coachella, the Imperial Valley or 
Salinas. Three of us from my town came to Salinas.'

He says he entered the program with three others from his hometown and they were all stationed at a celery farm near Chualar.

It
 was after a day of cutting and bagging celery that the workers were 
boarded onto a bus to be shuttled back to their work camp.

The
 workers sat on four boards, two in the middle and two on the sides of 
the bus. Once everyone was seated the bus began to move, but Tovar had 
gotten up to go to the front of the bus.

Deadly: Tovar and other foreign laborers were leaving a day of work on a celery farm in September 1963 when their bus was hit by a train. Twenty-eight people died on the scene and four later at the hospital. Above, the site of the accident

He
 left a bag tied to the table near the front of the vehicle, and 
therefore escaped the direct hit of a train that hit the back of the 
bus.

He says he didn't hear the train whistle, but rememebrs feeling the impact. 

When he came to, there were already bodies on the ground covered in orange blankets and then he passed out again.

When he woke up again, he started looking for his friend Sixto Robles Urzua but couldn't find him.

'I
 walked to the bodies, uncovered the tarps, saw two or three bodies, but
 I didn't recognize any of them. They were completely disfigured. I kept
 walking and when I couldn't walk anymore, I sat by the edge of the 
field.

Twenty-eight
 people died at the scene and four later at the hospital in what the 
National Safety Council has described as the biggest fatal vehicle 
accident in U.S. history.

Tovar was taken to Carmel Hospital, where a woman volunteered to help write his family at home.

'She
 told my mom that I was OK, not to be worried. I was all banged up, my 
shoulder blade was broken, but I could walk,' Tovar recalls.

After
 spending two months in the hospital, Tovar returned home to Mexico and 
spent the next several years traveling into Mexico City for interviews 
with insurance companies about a settlement. In 1968 he was awarded 92,000 pesos. 

'During
 those visits, I used to see some of the remaining survivors, the widows
 and the mothers,' he said. 'After we got the money, I lost track of 
everybody. I've always thought about the event, but I lost touch.'

Tovar
 revisted that dark day two years ago though when he returned to site of
 the crash and found nothing - no marker to remember the lost lives.

This
 September marked the 50th Anniversary of the crash, and there's been 
renewed interest in the event especially among immigration rights 
actvists who sucessfully lobbied to get a stretch of Highway 101 
dedicated as the Bracero Memorial HighWay.

The dedication was held in September, and today there's a sign marking the crash where Tovar found nothing two years ago.

The sign reads: 'RIP 32 braceros. Sept. 17, 1963. 4:25 PM.'

On
 Thursday, Tovar traveled back to the accident site with his wife and 
son to talk with researchers about the accident and his part in the 
Bracero program.

He
 also appeared with Flores Barragan, the only other survivor of the 
crash, at a ceremony honoring 10 former braceros at Stanford university 
the same day.
