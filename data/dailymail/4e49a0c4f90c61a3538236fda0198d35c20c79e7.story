The name Brabham could return to Formula One if ambitious plans to revive the iconic brand come to fruition.

Codenamed 'Project Brabham', the aim is to use crowdfunding as its main financial source to create what they claim will be 'an innovative model of open-source racing'.

Brabham will initially return to the track next season with a three-year LMP2 programme in the World Endurance Championship.

By year four, the marque will run as a constructor in LMP1, with the goal of winning the WEC and Le Mans.

Longer-term ambitions include the prospect of competing in Formula E, as well potentially making a comeback in F1.

Brabham's last race was in 1992 in Hungary, with 1996 world champion Damon Hill at the wheel in his maiden campaign.

Spearheading the project is David Brabham, son of three-times world champion Sir Jack, and who has enjoyed an exemplary racing career of his own.

Brabham, winner of Le Mans in 2009, said: 'I have long dreamt of seeing the Brabham team back out on the track, winning at the highest level and continuing the legacy my father laid down when he first started the team in the '60s.

'Looking at the normal racing model was not exciting or sustainable enough for me to rebuild the team from scratch.

'For me to bring Brabham back we have to do things differently.

'After careful consideration and research we have created a new model of open-source racing which will bring fans closer to the action, inspire drivers and engineers around the world and offer the rare opportunity to be a part of this new, but historical, race team.

'We will open the door to people and share the incredible journey that awaits us.

'I am a big believer in the power of collective thinking and see many advantages in this model that will help Brabham become a winning team again, but in a new and inspiring way.

The Brabham team won back-to-back constructors' and drivers' titles in 1966 and 1967

'Who knows where that could lead? Back to Formula One, I hope.

'Project Brabham gives people the chance to be part of the team from the start.'

Sir Jack Brabham, who died earlier this year, remains the only driver in F1 history to have won the world title - in 1966 - with a car of his own construction.

Further constructors' and drivers' titles followed in 1967 with New Zealander Denny Hulme at the wheel, whilst Nelson Piquet won two further drivers' championships in 1981 and 1983 under current F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone's ownership.

David Brabham himself competed in F1 with Brabham in 1990 and again four years later with Simtek.
