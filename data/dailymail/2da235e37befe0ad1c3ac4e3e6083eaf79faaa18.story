Brutal: Marco Oswald's ear after he was savagely bitten in an unprovoked attack while ordering a pizza in his local takeaway

A former model has had to pay £10,000 for reconstructive surgery to rebuild his ear after it was savagely bitten in an unprovoked attack.

Marco Oswald was ordering food in a pizza takeaway in Ferryhill, County Durham, when a stranger entered the takeaway and started fighting him.

The man told him he was going to bite his ear off and 'eat it' before ripping off a huge chunk of Marco's ear with his teeth.

Marco, 23, said: 'He got me onto the floor and said he was going to bite my ear off and eat it.'

The man bit Marco's left ear, tearing off a part half-way up.

A
takeaway worker jumped from behind the counter and pulled the attacker 
away, but bleeding heavily, Marco was rushed to hospital.

He
underwent five hours of reconstructive surgery at Spire Washington 
Hospital, last Wednesday, where cartilage was cut from his right ear and
skin grafted from his arm.

He
was discharged on Friday and will have bandages and 30 staples removed 
from his head this Friday and bandages removed from his arm the week 
after.

Marco has released photographs to help police find his attacker, who, eight months after the shocking assault, remains at large.

His family, who have footed the bill for his surgery, are offering a £2,000 reward for information leading to a conviction.

Marco, from Chilton, County Durham, had been out with friends when he was attacked in at about 1.10am on Monday, May 6, last year.

His girlfriend Gemma Vasey, 20, was with him when the assault took place.

Doctors have told Marco it could be another year before the bitten ear heals and he will be left permanently scarred.

He has had to take time off work and will be unable to play for his Sunday league football team, Ferryhill Dynamos, for several months.

Durham police have reissued their appeal for information on the attack.

A spokeswoman said no suspect had yet been identified.

Marco described his attacker as about 5ft 8in with light brown hair, wearing a white top and dark trousers.
