You would expect tadpoles to be timid when they are starting out life in a pond, but this lot found strength in numbers as thousands swarmed around an underwater photographer.

The tiny, bold amphibians were captured in these beautiful shots as the photographer tried to take photographs of lilies and plants underwater.

Eiko Jones was stunned when he was suddenly swimming among thousands of tadpoles in the Cedar Lake near the Campbell River in Canada.

The 41-year-old was pleasantly surprised when he saw the swimmers while he waited patiently in the water.

He said: ‘I was in the water for three hours and I was lucky that they swam right by me and all around me.

‘I was there taking pictures of the 
lilies and other water plants when all of a sudden there was this huge 
"cloud" coming towards me - I didn't even know what it was at first.

Swimming with the babies: Mr Jones described it as a huge 'cloud' of tadpoles as they swam around him for about ten minutes

‘They were moving very quickly, but there were thousands of them around me for ten minutes, which was great.’

The underwater photographer spends two days a week taking pictures.

He said: ‘I couldn't believe it when a huge cloud of tadpoles swam past in a huge long trail while they were searching for feeding areas at the edge of the lake.

‘At first I didn't know what I was seeing and then when I realised it was tadpoles schooling. I knew I was seeing a fairly rare sight - I have never seen or heard of tadpoles schooling.

A school of swimmers: Tadpoles are the larval stage in the life cycle of an amphibian, mainly toads and frogs, and are usually totally aquatic-bound

‘It's a very unique view of a tadpole's world that very few people would ever get to see.’

Cedar Lake is a 6500-acre wilderness lake that is 16 miles long and has varying depths of a few feet up to 60 feet. It also has 62 miles of shoreline.

At first they do not have arms or legs but as they grow into adulthood they develop limbs and lungs. Most are herbivores, eating algae and plants.
