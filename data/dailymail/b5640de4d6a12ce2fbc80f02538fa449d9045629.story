GIGGS WAS A JOY TO WATCH BUT HIS PLACE AMONG THE VERY BEST IS UNCERTAIN

BARKLEY, SHAW AND WICKHAM PROVE YOUNG TALENT CAN FLOURISH

Does it make any sense for Aaron Ramsey to stay at Arsenal?

It might just be dawning on him now, that while Saturday’s victory was a special day, it’s almost literally nothing compared to this coming Saturday night in Lisbon.

That’s the stage on which Ramsey belongs.

He’s destined for bigger things than an FA Cup winners’ medal, and a bigger stage than Arsenal can offer him.

He turns 24 in December, which is the age Gareth Bale is right now and his Wales team-mate will be his inspiration.

Bale’s ability made him the star at Tottenham but living with and flourishing alongside the elite at Real Madrid this season has confirmed Bale’s world class talent.

He used to be a sizeable carp in a tiny pond at Spurs; Bale is now a killer whale in the Real Madrid ocean.

It’s time for Ramsey to move on too, and if Bayern Munich get serious with their interest, it’s a no-brainer. And not just because he should be playing for a stellar club who take the Champions League seriously.

He’s served his time at Arsenal. He suffered a career-threatening injury but came back to be the best player in the team.

And the truth is Arsenal fans don’t deserve him.

Ramsey had to live with vile abuse from a few Gooners, and criticism from a lot of them, when his form wasn’t good.

The abuse was so bad Arsene Wenger considered leaving him out of games at the Emirates, something the Arsenal manager reflected openly on as Ramsey hit top form earlier this season.

Ramsey needed encouragement and patience from supporters at a time when he was coming back from that leg break. Instead he was booed, told he wasn’t good enough for the team, didn’t deserve a new contract and there was even a death threat aimed at him from one Arsenal fan.

Most of those fans will admit they were wrong, or at least applaud the player for turning his form around.

But when a player receives a bad leg break coupled with abuse from his own fans, he won’t forget in a hurry.

Ramsey owes the Arsenal fans absolutely nothing.

And while some may think he owes Arsene Wenger for all the support the Gunners boss gave him during the bad times, they should think again.

Ramsey should, but will never be considered the star of this Arsenal line up. Go back to Arsenal's 1-0 defeat by David Moyes’ Manchester United at Old Trafford earlier this season.

Despite his brilliant form Ramsey was shifted out wide in that game to accommodate Mesut Ozil. And Arsenal lost.

The £42.5m Germany midfielder will always be given star billing, otherwise Wenger risks fuelling the critics’ belief that he can’t handle signing expensive players.

I thought Ramsey was world class against Hull City in the Cup final, but I couldn’t help feeling that when ITV were trumpeting their Champions League final coverage from Lisbon this coming Saturday, the Arsenal midfielder belonged on that stage, rather than doing what Ben Watson did for Wigan last season.

If there are Arsenal fans reading this asking, “Why would he want to leave the Emirates?”, they can only squirm when they realise they sound just like the Spurs fans who asked the same question of Bale this time last year.

Let’s face facts here: if Ramsey was English he’d be going to the World Cup this summer. There is nothing he can do about that.

But he can do something about which club he plays for, so why would he stay at Arsenal if he can go and achieve true greatness elsewhere?

And all those Arsenal fans who were laying into him as he was making his way back form injury, have no right to grudge him what he truly deserves.
