During the last 14 years, the couple has worked to expand their family and said that all of the children work together as a really good team

The couple has begun the process of adoption and are seeking funding to help add the Tanzanian boys to their family

Jackson, who has albinism, was taken to the orphanage by his mother to keep him safe because in Tanzania, many with the hereditary genetic condition are killed for witchcraft, according to the Greens' adoption fundraising page.

The other little boy, Noel, was born with down syndrome and was abandoned on church steps.

The couple, who has been married for 18 years, has begun the process of adoption and are seeking help with the nearly $40,000 needed to help bring them home. 

Kimberly said: 'We'd love to make these little guys members of our family. Ben and I are hoping to make our first visit to meet them next month sometime.'

During the last 14 years, the couple has worked to expand their family and said that all of their children work together as a really good team, according to Click On Detroit.

The couple previously had 14 children but they lost their daughter Selah and son Josiah who both passed away as infants.

As the pair hope to welcome Jackson and Noel into their family, they said they are unsure when they will stop adopting.

Ben said: 'I would have never imagined. Just when Kim and I were going through the infertility stuff, and it was a pretty devastating time in our lives. 

'You think you can't have kids. Never did I imagine that we would be in a situation like this.'
