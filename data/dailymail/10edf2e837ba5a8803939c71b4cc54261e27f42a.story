Ajax manager Frank de Boer and some of his players were given a scare when they assessed the club's potential new strips for next season.

Executives from adidas invited them to a meeting where De Boer and players Siem de Jong, Daley Blind and Jasper Cillessen were shown shirts featuring 'typical Dutch imagery', including pancakes, tulips and bicycles.

Another shirt idea featured psychedelic colours blended on the front and a large image of a lion's head.

Stereotype: Designs included this fetching number with Dutch tulips emblazoned on the front

Luckily for the Eredivisie giants it was all part of an elaborate prank.

The shirt designs were certainly not what the players and manager expected and led to some interesting reactions.

Cillessen said: 'It's too much for me,' before adding: 'I don't like it.'

De Boer, meanwhile, sat slumped in his chair with a look of disbelief on his face before scratching his head and letting out an exasperated sigh.

When the adidas executive left the room De Boer turned to former Ajax goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and said: 'I have the feeling that we won't be taken seriously.'

Upset: Siem de Jong and Daley Blind both made their feelings known about the designs

He was then asked if there was anything positive that he did like about the new shirt, to which he answered bluntly: 'No.'

In another meeting Blind motioned towards one of the shirts and told De Jong: 'This is really bad.'

De Jong replied: 'Yeah, I agree. I am not wearing this. I really don't want to.'

When the adidas executive eventually revealed the ruse and exposed a host of hidden cameras a look of relief was evident on the face of players and manager alike.

At the end Cillessen added: 'I thought Van der Sar had gone crazy.'

Exasperated: Jasper Cillessen was another Ajax player called in to discuss the strips

Concern: De Boer said he was worried Ajax would not be taken seriously with the potential designs

Leftfield: This design showed a lion's face covering the whole shirt and received unanimously negative reviews
