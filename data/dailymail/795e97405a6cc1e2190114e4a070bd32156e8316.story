Everybody knows his bright red van.

But no one knew it could do this.

In a bizarre twist on the iconic children's TV show, Postman Pat's delivery car has been transformed into a high-speed powerhouse.

With a top speed of 101.36mph, it is faster than a Porsche.

The little red van has a quicker quarter mile time than supercars such as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS

The 100mph race car started life as a coin-operated arcade ride.

But after three motor enthusiasts found the toy on eBay for £250 in 2012, they couldn't resist turning it into one of their fleet.

They fitted it with wheels and a 500cc motorbike engine, and took it to the track.

The little red van, complete with a toy cat stuck to the back, now has a faster quarter-mile speed than supercars such as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS and Aston Martin V-12 Vanquish.

After reaching 101.36mph at York Raceway in May, it has this month been deemed the world's fastest coin-operated ride according to the Guinness Book of Records.

It is a far cry from Pat Clifton's rickety red truck he drives around a village based on Cumbria's Longsleddale

In the show, which first screened in 1981, Pat Clifton and his black-and-white cat, Jess, are known for trundling around the fictional village of Greendale with the day's mail.

Each episode, bumbling Pat gets distracted by a customer's problem and strives, ham-handedly to fix it.

In a later series screened in 2004, the BBC's beloved postman was promoted to head of the flashy Special Delivery Service, with a speedy red motorbike. But driven by the cautious and dopey Mr Clifton, it was still relatively slow.

It is a far cry from the flashy scenes delighting nostalgic fans on race tracks around the country.

Pat Van team Tom Armitage, David Taylor and Ben Rushforth have been trialling creation for months - to hordes of disbelieving onlookers.

And with news spreading fast, there are now calls for the Leeds-based group to take it to the States.

Mr Armitage, 25, said: 'The Pat Van is probably the most talked about race car in the country at the moment and has even made a huge impact in the USA.

'After an aggressive launch the little Postman Pat Van powered its way to victory.

'We have been up against supercars such as a Porsche 968 and we left it standing, showing the spectators how fast this little van really is.'

But, he insists, it requires expert driving to perform at its best: 'There is nobody that could just get in the van and drive it quite like Ben does. Without a driver like Ben the van would not be what it is right now.'

Original: The box-like van became iconic when it first hit screens in 1981. Despite recent CGI adaptations which gave Pat a motorbike, they are still not a patch on the new race car

The three members of Pat Van Racing have been interested in drag racing since an early age. They were all just weeks old when they attended their first drag race at York Raceway.

Mr Armitage said: 'The idea behind the Pat Van started a couple years ago, but we never actually made a start building the van until mid-2012. We sourced a Postman Pat child’s coin operated ride from eBay for £250 and started to build it.

'All the fabrication and engineering has been carried out by David Taylor and I. Pat 1 is powered by a 500cc single cylinder motorbike engine.

'The build was kept very quiet and very few people knew about the project, but now the Pat Van has become famous-people love it.'

The iconic stop-motion children's show was first screened in 1981.

It was written by John Cunliffe and directed by Ivor Wood of Paddington Bear and The Magic Roundabout fame.

The second series in 1996, after a number of TV specials, introduced Pat's wife, Sara, and six-year-old son, Julian.

Set
in the fictional village of Greendale, based on the valley of 
Longsleddale in Cumbria, Pat Clifton and his black and white cat, Jess, are problem-solvers.

Every episode starts with Pat delivering letters before becoming distracted by a problem.

It was a key promotional tool for The Royal Mail until 2004 when any mention of the service was dropped from the show.

This
third series saw Pat promoted to head of the Special Delivery Service 
in the nearby town of Pencaster, where he has a fleet of vehicles 
including a motorbike with a side-car for Jess.

The franchise of TV 
episodes and books will soon include a 3D movie starring Stephen Mangan 
as Pat, with co-stars including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David 
Tennant.
