Danny Simpson insists all Leicester players are fully behind manager Nigel Pearson despite losing at Aston Villa to extend their winless run to 10 matches.

The right-back made his first start since signing from Queens Park Rangers at Villa Park as goals from Ciaran Clark and Alan Hutton wiped out Leo Ulloa's opener. 

Leicester sit bottom and Pearson was caught on camera last week telling an abusive supporter to 'f*** off and die'.

Simpson insisted the squad back their manager '100 per cent'.

'If it wasn't that you would see it from the outside,' he said. 'From the performances you could say "They aren't behind him". 

'We are trying to do the right things and it has to turn. A couple of wins and everything changes. 

Alan Hutton scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his side - his first-ever for Aston Villa

'It's fine margins, that's what the manager has said. We know it's going to change. The next few weeks it'll be important.' 

Simpson believes poor form has actually brought the players together. 'It can do and it probably has, it goes one way or the other,' he added. 'It's a tight group and we know it has to change.

'It's not like we're coming in and having a pop at each other and saying 'You didn't do this or that'. We are together.'
