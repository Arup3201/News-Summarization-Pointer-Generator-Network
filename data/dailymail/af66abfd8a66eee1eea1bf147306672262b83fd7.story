A couple fear they might have to leave their newborn baby in Georgia due to a delay in getting her a passport because she was born to a surrogate.

Nigel and Caroline Griffiths enlisted the help of a surrogate mother after the couple tried unsuccessfully to conceive for ten years. Their 'little miracle' Grace was born in the country’s capital Tblisi on June 16.

But when a backlog of applications left the Passport Office in chaos, the pair were forced to apply for an emergency travel document (ETD) to bring Grace back to the UK.

'We just want to bring her home': Nigel Griffiths, 46, from south London, pictured with daughter Grace, fears he and wife Caroline will have to leave Grace in Tblisi, Georgia,
 where she was born due to passport office delays

Now the couple - who said they had meticulously followed advice about obtaining a travel document for their daughter -  have been told they face a wait of 16 weeks because of extra checks which need to be carried out in a surrogacy case.

But they are also facing a race against time to apply for an order in the UK that legally recognises them as her parents. 

Mr Griffiths, 46, who is her biological 
father, said: 'We just want to bring her home. I 
have done a DNA test which proves I am her father so surely I should 
just pass on my nationality? I don’t understand why it takes 16 weeks.

'We are just full of worry. It’s ridiculous, really. It’s going to be at least a month (in Georgia) that we hadn’t planned for.'

Mr Griffiths, a chartered surveyor, said he and his wife were given the impression they 
would be able to bring Grace home within three months at the longest.

He has now returned home to Bermondsey, south London, while his 57-year-old wife, who runs a human resources consultancy, is still in Georgia with the baby.

Grace was a 'little miracle' for Mr Griffiths and his wife Caroline, who unsuccessfully tried to conceive for ten years

If the situation drags on, they fear they may have to hire a nanny and leave Grace in Tblisi until the application is approved.

He described the prospect of missing that deadline to register as her parents as 'unthinkable'.

He said: 'This was going to be our last 
chance - it was an amazing little miracle. It was amazing (when Grace 
was born). I was in tears.'

Mr and Mrs Griffiths decided to pursue surrogacy after years of failed attempts using IVF treatment.

They chose to have the baby in Georgia because of complicated legal issues surrounding the process in the UK.

They paid several thousand pounds for the service and the baby was conceived using Mr Griffiths’ sperm and a donor egg.

Mr Griffiths said they had spoken to officials in the British Embassy in Tblisi several months before the birth.

He said they were led to believe the application for the baby’s passport would take around six to eight weeks, or maybe 12 'at a push'.

Around the time Grace was born, measures were introduced to ease the backlog of passport applications.

This included allowing parents or guardians of children overseas to apply for an ETD instead of a new or renewed passport.

Mr Griffiths said they went to apply for the ETD at the embassy on Friday but were advised that authorities in the UK had warned it would take 16 weeks to process.

He said he had faced problems checking on the progress of the application since returning to Britain.

The couple, who followed advice, had to apply for an emergency travel document after the Passport Office was left in chaos. That application has a 16-week wait due to extra tests required in surrogacy cases

He said: 'I rang the passport office on Monday and someone rang me back yesterday saying we haven’t got any application from you.

'We don’t even know if the process has been started. No one tells you anything.'

The couple have written to their local MP Simon Hughes to plead for help bringing Grace home.

Their letter said: 'The mistakes made are causing needless distress and worry to us both, at a time when we thought we would be experiencing the happiness of family life.

'No one would wish for there to be a negative impact on Grace because of delays caused by inaccurate advice.'
