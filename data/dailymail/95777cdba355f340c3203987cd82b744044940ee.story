All set: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari (centre) speaks with his players during a training session on Friday

Team news: Brazil captain Thiago Silva will return to the side after he missed the 7-1 thrashing by Germany through a one-match suspension.

Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari is expected to make a number of changes, with Dani Alves possibly returning to the starting line-up. Neymar, of course, will not feature.

Holland coach Louis Van Gaal may also be tempted to make some changes, with Memphis Depay and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in contention for a starting place.

Key clash: Thiago Silva (Brazil) v Robin van Persie (Holland)

Brazil captain Thiago Silva returns to boost the defensive line that Germany tore apart and will look to limit the contributions of Holland's all-time leading scorer Robin van Persie.

Since hitting the back of the net twice in his team's 5-1 win over Spain and adding another in a 3-2 triumph over Australia in the group stages, Van Persie has not been as effective.

Van Persie sat out the game against Chile through suspension and was bothered by a stomach injury before the Argentina game.

One to watch: Arjen Robben (Holland)

Arjen Robben has been one of the top players of the World Cup, his sixth major tournament with Holland.

The Bayern Munich winger has led the Dutch in scoring with three goals and will lament the fact that only the excellent defending of Argentina's Javier Mascherano denied him a fourth in the semi-final.
