Arturo Vidal's transfer from Juventus to Manchester United has hit a snag because of  doubts about the Chilean's fitness, according to his national team coach.

Jorge Sampaoli, quoted in El Mercurio, says that United boss Louis van Gaal is wary of spending £47m because of the midfielder's problematic knee injury.

Vidal has been a long-term target for the Premier League side, with reports suggesting a move has been close all summer.

Fitness worry: Chile boss Jorge Sampaoli says Louis van Gaal has doubts about the midfielder's knee injury

'I know that the main problem in Vidal’s $80m (£47m) transfer from Juventus to Manchester United is Louis van Gaal’s doubt over the improvement of Arturo's knee,' Sampaoli told the Chilean publication.

The Argentinean coach also believes Vidal was just '30 or 40 per cent' of the player he was for Juve last season at the World Cup, and could be paying for pushing himself too hard.

Vidal had knee cartilage surgery at the beginning of May and was rushed back to feature in Brazil.
