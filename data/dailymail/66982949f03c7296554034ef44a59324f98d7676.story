The parents of a Texas high school football player have filed a bullying complaint against a rival team - claiming the teen's 91-0 loss amounted to tormenting their son.

To be sure, the Bearcats of Aledo High School humiliated Western Hills High School on the field Friday night.

But Aledo coach Tim Buchanan says the score would have been even higher if he hadn't made his team pull its punches.

Pulling punches: Aledo High School coach Tim Buchanan says the score against Western Hills High School would have been even higher if he hadn't pulled his best players

The Aledo Bearcats reached the endzone again and again during Friday night's blow-out victory over Western Hills High School

'In actuality, we prolly could have scored a lot more if we hadn't have done the running clock and done some other things,' he told KXAS-TV.

'I was really fearful we were going to score 100.'

Buchanan said he started substituting out his best players in the first quarter when it became apparent that Western Hills High wasn't playing in the same league as his team.

The Aledo Bearcats are a dominating team. So far this season they are unbeaten, and have completed their games with a combined score of 485-47.

Even the coach for Western Hills said he doesn't agree with the complaint. His players just met a vastly superior team.

'We just ran into a buzzsaw, you know,' Coach John Naylor told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

The coach of Western Hills High School says he disagrees with the complaint, adding that his players simply met a vastly better team on the field

The Western Hills High School student whose parents filed the complaint has not been identified

'They just 
play hard. And they’re good sports, and they don’t talk at all. They 
get after it, and that’s the way football is supposed to be played in 
Texas.'

Under Texas law, Aledo school officials must investigate the complaint with the same rigor as a report that a student is being harassed and beaten up by classmates.

The complaint was made against the coaching staff through the school's website, which offers a form that can be filled out and submitted online.

The parents of a Western Hills High School player filed the complaint. The student and the parents have not been named.

The Texas Education Agency defines bullying this way: 'Bullying occurs when a person is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons, and he or she has difficulty defending himself or herself.

;Bullying is aggressive behavior that involves unwanted, negative actions. Bullying involves a pattern of behavior repeated over time. Bullying involves an imbalance of power or strength.'

Aledo coach Buchanan says he's never heard of the term applied to simply playing a football game.

He said he regrets that the victory was so lopsided, but he said his players must still give 100percent of their effort when they take the field.

'To go out and tell your kids, "No, I don't want you to play hard, because we're ahead," that's against every fundamental coaching strategy that you have,' he said.
