Prince Albert II of Monaco paid a visit to the hospital to visit his wife Princess Charlene and their new twins Prince Jacques Honore Ranier and Princess Gabriella Therese Marie. 

The babies were delivered at the Princess Grace hospital in Monaco, named after their late grandmother. 

Princess Gabriella was the first born baby, but her younger brother will inherit the Principality's throne.

Each of the twins received their own 21 cannon shots after the official announcement. 

Prince Albert said: 'I wish to share this moment of happiness with the Monegasque people and more widely with all my country's residents. 

It is understood that Princess Charlene will remain in hospital until Monday having delivered the twins by caesarean section.

Last night's announcement saw hundreds of people take to the streets, waving their flags in jubilation, and beaming as 42 cannon shots rang out around the city.

The official announcement of the birth came this morning, with two placards, one in French and one in English, hung on the outer wall of the flag-festooned Palais Princier by a battalion of carabinieres. 

Official announcement: The Palais Princier officially announced the birth this morning via a placard affixed to the wall

Solemn: The statement spoke of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene's delight at the birth of the royal twins

Formal: Two placards, one in French and one in English, were used to announce the royal birth

Jubilant: News of the birth was met with scenes of jubilation in the principality, the second smallest independent country in the world

Royal salute: The babies' arrival was also celebrated with a royal salute from a battalion of carabinieres

The statement read: 'It is with immense joy that TT.SS.HH the prince and princess of Monaco have the great pleasure to announce the birth of their children named: Gabriella, Thérèse, Marie (born at 17h04) Jacques, Honoré, Rainier (born at 17h06).'

Babies Gabriella and Jaques arrived within minutes of each other last night, with the little girl born first at 5.04pm and her brother following two minutes later at 5.06pm.

Despite being the younger, it will be Prince Jacques who succeeds his father on the throne, thanks to Monaco's continued embrace of Salic Law which states that male heirs always take precedence over their older sisters.

She will, however, get a title, becoming the Countess of Carlades, while Crown Prince Jacques will get the traditional style of Marquis of Baux - a name always given to the first born son.

The children, who are the first for 36-year-old Princess Charlene, were delivered at the Princess Grace Hospital - named after their late grandmother - where members of the media are currently gathering as they await the babies' first public appearance.

Recovering: Princess Charlene, who was last seen on Monaco's National Day in November, is recovering in hospital after the birth

Respect: The placing of the placards was followed by a salute from the Carabinieres - watched by a crowd of photographers

Thrilled: Monaco's citizens and residents have spoken of their delight following the birth of the twin heirs

Assured: The birth of two children means Monaco's future is assured, with Prince Jacques set to succeed his father

Excitement: It isn't only  Monaco's residents who are thrilled - news of the birth brought messages of congratulations from around the world

While they wait, residents of Monaco are celebrating by covering everything - including homes and yachts - in national flags, which will remain in place until the babies are formally presented to the public from the balcony of the Palais Princier.

For Fabienne Guenoune, president of the Le Rocher residents' association, 'the 42 cannon shots announcing the birth seals more than ever the future of the country'.

'A boy and a girl, it's the wish of a king,' added Michele Mattoni, another resident of The Rock, as Monaco is also known. 'This is an explosion of joy for all Monegasques,' said Marguerite-Marie Bergonzi, who comes from one of the oldest families in the world's second smallest independent state.

Charlene, who is said to be doing well, gave birth by caesarian section and is likely to remain in hospital for at least another four days as she recovers from the birth.

Her husband Prince Albert remains by her side and was there when she gave birth to the babies, which replace their aunt Caroline as heirs to the throne. 

Standing to attention: Carabinieres stand guard outside the Palais Princier in Monaco this morning

Festooned: The front of the Palais Princier was awash with national flags, hung to celebrate the birth

Colourful: Yachts in the marina were also given the flags treatment and provided a colourful sight

Jubilant: Last night saw ecstatic locals take to the streets to celebrate after the royal birth was announced

Overjoyed: Residents took to the streets after hearing the 42 cannon shots that heralded the twins' birth

Excited: The babies will be officially presented to the populace on the balcony of the Palais Princier once they leave hospital

Although females are not allowed to inherit under Salic Law,  the late Prince Rainier III rewrote the constitution after becoming ill in 2002 to make it possible for one of his daughters to inherit if his son - who has two illegitimate children - failed to produce a legitimate heir.

That all changed after Albert, 56, married former Olympic swimmer Charlene, 36, in 2011 - 11 years after the pair first met. Early this year, the couple finally announced they were expecting after a three-year wait.

The gender of the twins had been kept a secret during Charlene's pregnancy, including from their father who said last month that he was looking forward to being surprised.

During the same interview, he also made plain that should the twins turn out to be a boy and a girl, it would be the boy who succeeded him, regardless of birth order.

Albert, who was once considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors, succeeded his father Prince Rainier in 2005 at the age of 47. He already had a daughter, Jazmin, 22, after a fling with former waitress Tamara Rotolo. He denied being her father for years before DNA tests proved otherwise when she was a teenager.

The prince also has a younger son, Alexandre Coste, 11, from an affair with Nicole Coste, a Togolese former Air France hostess. Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of them have any claim to royal titles or to be considered as heirs to Albert because they were born outside of marriage.

They do however have legal rights to a share of his huge personal fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine to exceed $1 billion (800 million euros). 

Colourful: Red and white Monagasque flags hang from every window at the Palais Princier

Quick fix: A member of Palais staff adds to the already vast collection of celebratory flags

Need some help? The man gets a little help from one of the maids as he struggles with the banner

Almost there: With the flag in place, he finally manages to complete the job

Boom! The first of a series of cannon shots announcing the royal birth is fired over the Mediterranean last night

And again! The blast lights up the city skyline - including one impressively large yacht moored in the marina below

Tradition: Royal births are usually announced with 21 cannon blasts but because there are two babies, 42 cannon blasts were fired

Expectant: Photographers wanting to catch a glimpse of the new babies have begun arriving outside the hospital

Interest: As news of the birth spread, hordes of photographers and camera crews began to descend
