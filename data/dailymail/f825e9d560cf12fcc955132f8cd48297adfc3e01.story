Accused: David Engle, coach of Maple Valley youth baseball team, is accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting the boy over a period of six years

A youth baseball coach has been accused of repeatedly raping a boy on camera days after he was charged with buy child pornography.

David Engle, 49, coach of Maple Valley youth baseball team, is accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting the boy over a period of six years.

Prosecutors allege that Engle recorded himself raping his struggling victim.

Engle was first arrested on November 6 after agents with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and other agencies traced an online purchase of child pornography to his home and recovered photos and video that further implicates him.

Engle had been heavily involved in youth baseball.

He coached a Select Bronco team of 11 and 12 year olds, was president of Maple Valley Pony Baseball and Fast Pitch, and served on two regional baseball organisations.

The baseball coach who was already facing child pornography production and possession charges and has now been charged by King County prosecutors with three counts of child rape.

Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregson claimed Engle had gone to great lengths to have contact with children while amassing a large collection of child pornography.

The Seattle Pi reported that Gregson told the court: 'The state has overwhelming evidence that the defendant committed countless acts of sexual assault upon his victim for years without detection.'

Engle’s arrest followed an international investigation into a website dealing in 'naturist films' – a euphemism for child pornography.

Postal inspectors made a series of undercover purchases from the website before law enforcement workers raided the business and seized a wealth of child pornography and business records.

Further investigations of  customers who used the site led detectives to Engle who is alleged to have spent $2,300 on videos and photos sent to him by the company.

Investigators said the majority of the graphic images purchased by Engle from the site showed nude, prepubescent boys being sexually assaulted.

Investigators raided Engle’s home the day he was arrested, and allegedly recovered a significant amount of additional pornography to that which he bought online.

Engle has been charged with having about 11,000 suspicious images on his laptop, and additional DVDs and digital storage devices were also recovered.

Investigators claim to have since uncovered photos and video of Engle raping one boy, triggering the secondary, more serious charge that he now faces.

According to charging documents filed in King County Superior Court, investigators recovered photos that indicate Engle had been raping the boy for six years.

Engle allegedly took more than 1,400 photos and dozens of videos of himself and the child during the sexual assaults, King County Detective Marylisa Priebe-Olson told the court.

During one, the detective said in court documents, Engle was seen raping the boy while watching a baseball game on television. He said it shows the boy struggling against him and being told 'no.'

Engle, who remains in custody, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making and receiving child pornography; he has not yet entered a plea to the three child rape charges he faces in state court.
