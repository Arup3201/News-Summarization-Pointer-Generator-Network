A team of diggers has started removing 2,500 tonnes of waste from a 40ft-high rat-infested rubbish pile which has blighted the lives of residents for the past three years.

The towering mountain of putrid rubbish sits at the end of cul-de-sac near Orpington, Kent, and is laden with everything 
imaginable - from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges 
to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles.

The stinking mound - which residents say 'smells like rotting corpses' - is also prone to catching fire, as 'hot spots' smoulder deep inside the 60-ft wide pile of rubbish. Fire crews have now been called to 23 fires at the site - one of which lasted ten days - which has cost the taxpayer £650,000.

This 40ft pile of stinking rubbish has blighted the lives of 
residents living in a cul-de-sac near Orpington, Kent, since 
2011. Now, experts from the Environment Agency are starting to remove 
some of the waste

The Environment Agency, which has been locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site, has called in experts to remove 2,500 tonnes of rubbish from the 20,000 tonne pile

The towering mountain, which sits at the end of cul-de-sac, is laden with everything imaginable - from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles

Now the Environment Agency - which is locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site - has ordered experts to remove some of the mess so the pile is at a 'safe' level and stops spontaneously catching fire.

But fed-up locals in Cornwall Drive, St Paul's Cray, say the action is not enough - and have called for the entire 20,000-tonne mountain to be removed.

Jan Watkins, 60, a grandmother-of-two, said: 'It is a plague. It is a living nightmare. It is really, really horrible. You can't open your doors or your windows. The smell that comes through is like rotting corpses.

'You can't go out, it is in your clothes, in your hair, because the smell gets in them. You can't use your garden. Many residents have sore throats and coughs. Anybody who has a breathing problem suffers greatly.'

Ms Watkins said residents had been campaigning to clear the site for three years and accused the EA of allowing the mound to spiral out of control by failing to take swift action. 

She said she feared the frequent fires 
were belching toxic fumes which could be endangering the health of her 
two young grandchildren, whom she looks after during the day.

She said: 'If the Environment Agency 
had taken action when we wanted them to two and a half years ago it 
would be half the size. We feel very, very let down.'

The mountain of garbage has been a problem for residents since rubbish disposal
 company Waste4Fuel took over the site in 2011.

Fire crews have been called to 23 fires at
 the site, mostly during the hot summer weather, costing the taxpayer £650,000 and taking up 2,000 hours of firefighters' time

But residents say efforts by the EA to remove some of the waste - which includes rotting industrial waste, tyres, scrap metal and even excrement - is too little too late. They are campaigning for the entire tip to be removed

According
 to its website, the firm’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
and it ‘specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that
 can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity.’

It charges people to dump rubbish at the site during the day and the night, which it then sorts, treats and sends on for disposal elsewhere.

But residents say this practice does not happen and instead, over the past couple of 
years, Waste4Fuel has simply taken the money and let it stack up into a 
monstrous pile.

Resident Denise Clark, 34, a mother-of-two, said : 'The smell, especially when it's hot, is repugnant, disgusting. 
It makes you feel sick to the stomach. It's like living next to a sewage
 works.

'We have a real rat 
problem. The size of the rats are massive - up to 2ft with their tails. I
 have a three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter and it makes me 
fear for their health. My son has eczema and it is not good for him.'

Diggers working on the site is the first sign of any tangible action 
being taken to free the residents of the rat-infested rubbish mound, which regularly catches fire

Waste4Fuel uses the site as a waste transfer site where it 'processes 
general non-hazardous waste'. It is allowed a maximum of 5,500 tonnes on the site at
 a time - but has almost four times that amount

She said local schools do not allow children out in the playground at break when the rubbish pile is on fire because of health fears. She added that residents fear the pile will one day cause a fire that gets out of control and spreads.

She said: 'About 18 months ago there was a fire that lasted 10 days and that was pretty scary. If the wind was blowing the other way it could have taken the whole street out.'

Ms Clark also blamed the unsightly 'scourge' for sending house prices in the street down, saying house prices had plummeted by £100,000.

The location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority, which in this case is Bromley Council.

But
 its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the 
Environment Agency, which allows Waste4Fuel to use the site ‘as a waste 
transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste, from commercial
 operators with [a maximum] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time.’

The pile is often seen emitting steam, as 
rubbish smoulders deep inside the mound, pictured left. It is that which
 has forced the EA to send in workers, pictured right, in a bid to take 
the mound to a 'safe' level

The height and width of the giant mound mean most residents can see the rubbish pile from their window. Resident Denise Clark, 34, said the smell is 'repugnant, disgusting' and it is 'like living next to a sewage works'

The
 Environment Agency is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm, claiming it has not been paying for 
the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere.

Last November, the agency won a court order for Waste4Fuel to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of April.

But the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week. It ended up failing to comply with the order.

The Environment Agency then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company, former company director Bryan Hughes, new company director Shelley Hurst and site manager Jonathan Beckson.

The charges were in relation to 
Waste4Fuel not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire
 breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site.

Resident Jan Watkins, 60, said she cannot open her doors or windows because the smell comes through like 'rotting corpses'. She said the smell even gets in her hair and on her clothes when she steps outside

Steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away, creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents

But, in July this year, the High Court dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal.

Talking about the team of diggers, the EA said: 'Environment Agency contractors have entered the Waste4Fuel site in Orpington in an operation to lower the illegal waste pile to a safe level.

'The Environment Agency's battle to ensure that the site operator and landowner clean up the site is continuing, but is taking this rare step to reduce the blight on the local community.'

Rob Wise, environment manager at the EA, said: 'We understand the frustration of local residents and we will continue our fight against Waste4Fuel.

'It is not right that taxpayers should pick up the bill for this operation when it remains the responsibility of the site operator and landowners, but the priority is to make the site as safe as possible.

'We are committed to working with our partners, including the London Borough of Bromley, to find a long-term solution.'
