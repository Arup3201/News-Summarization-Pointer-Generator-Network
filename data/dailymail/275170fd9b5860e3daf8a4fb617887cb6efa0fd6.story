Wales boss Warren Gatland has told autumn Test selection casualties Adam Jones and James Hook ‘the door is not closed’.

Despite boasting more than 170 caps between them, Cardiff Blues prop Jones - a triple Six Nations Grand Slam winner - and Gloucester fly-half Hook have not been chosen in a 34-man squad for appointments with Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and South Africa next month.

Gatland, whose squad includes six props, said: ‘It’s important that he (Jones) continues to keep working. We have had that conversation with him.

‘He looks in reasonable shape physically and there are other aspects of his game, particularly around the field, that we want him to keep working on and improving. ‘Definitely, the door is not closed for Adam Jones or James Hook. We know what Adam Jones is capable of giving us and I am sure if there is an injury or we need to look at bringing someone like Adam back, then we are able to do that.

Gloucester fly-half James Hook has also failed to make the cut for the forthcoming Autumn Series 

‘With the scrummaging rule changes, that put a lot of pressure on tighthead props. It probably dropped the value of tightheads by half overnight and what has become paramount is the ability of front rows to be more mobile.’

Ospreys prop Nicky Smith is the solitary uncapped player, with Sam Warburton confirmed as captain.

France-based players Leigh Halfpenny, Jonathan Davies, Jamie Roberts, Mike Phillips, Luke Charteris and Dan Lydiate also feature.

But 33-year-old Jones and 29-year-old Hook — both British and Irish Lions — find themselves on the outside looking in less than a year before the World Cup.
