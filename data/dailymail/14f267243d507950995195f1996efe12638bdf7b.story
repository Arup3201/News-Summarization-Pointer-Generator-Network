Zara Phillips has said she wants to compete in the World Eventing Championship next August after giving birth

Zara Phillips's pregnancy came as a complete ‘shock’ to her – disrupting her eventing schedule and forcing her out of the saddle.

The revelation came from her husband Mike Tindall during the couple’s first joint interview about  the pregnancy.

Interviewed by Australian Women’s Weekly, Mike said with a laugh: ‘It probably happened quicker than we thought – bit of a shock, really.’

But he admitted that once the surprise had worn off, they realised the timing was perfect.With the child due in January, it means Zara, 32, will still be on track to train for major eventing competitions next year.

Zara was heavily criticised during the summer for continuing to ride during the early stages of her pregnancy. Despite making it clear she would not yield to pressure from her critics, she has now  given up riding – and has taken  up baking instead.

The 2012 Olympic silver medal winner said: ‘I have been riding, but it’s so uncomfortable. So, yes, I’m baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.’

But the Queen’s granddaughter insisted she will be back in the saddle after the birth. She even hopes to compete in the World Eventing Championship next August and will take her baby with her on the eventing circuit – which is what her mother Princess Anne did after Zara was born.

The couple do not know if the baby is a boy or a girl and Mike, 35, said: ‘We want it to be a surprise. I’m really looking forward to it, but I’m not sure how I’ve prepared. We’ve been pretty relaxed. We’ve not sorted a nursery yet.

‘We have ordered some stuff, but we haven’t gone further than  that. I think we’re both quite  well-balanced and laid-back as a couple, so hopefully he or she will pick up on that.’

Zarah, granddaughter to the Queen, says pregnancy came much quicker than she expected and has disrupted her eventing schedule

Zara added: ‘I hope we’re going to make good parents – that’s the plan.’

The couple also talked about the time Mike bought a racehorse, Monbeg Dude, at an auction five years ago for £12,000, without  Zara knowing anything about it.

After the sale, Zara described  him as an ‘idiot’ and she told the magazine: ‘I thought it was a stupid idea. But he got lucky and it’s worked out well.’ The horse is now worth more than £200,000.

Mike, the son of a social worker, has come to appreciate the racing world through his wife. The rugby star said: ‘Before I met Zara,  I didn’t go to meets. I used to work at them on a fish and chip van at York races. But I like getting dressed up. It’s a fun day out.’
