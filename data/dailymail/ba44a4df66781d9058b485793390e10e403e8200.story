Education Secretary Nicky Morgan hailed teachers as ‘heroes’ yesterday as she tried to end the bitter battles with the unions fought by her predecessor Michael Gove.

Mrs Morgan, appointed to the Cabinet in July to smooth relations with the teaching profession, went out of her way to praise classroom staff for their efforts – and pledged to cut their workload.

Unions last night welcomed the change of approach and praised Mrs Morgan for her ‘warm words’. But delegates at the Conservative Party conference showed their appreciation for Mr Gove’s tough stance, giving him an extraordinary standing ovation when Mrs Morgan briefly mentioned him.

Embarrassingly, the applause for Mr Gove was noticeably more enthusiastic than that given to Mrs Morgan at the end of her speech.

Mrs Morgan praised her predecessor for the ‘passion, conviction and leadership [which] first provided the spark’. She insisted she would be continuing his reforms.

But she indicated she would adopt a far less confrontational approach to the teaching unions.

Mrs Morgan began her speech by praising Britain’s ‘dedicated and inspiring’ teachers, adding: ‘If our school story has a hero, it is them.’

She said she would offer them a ‘new deal’ designed to cut their workload – a key demand of the unions – and added: ‘When I hear of teachers working late into the night marking books, planning lessons, preparing for inspections that may or may not come, I do two things: I marvel at their dedication; but I also think, there must be a better way.’

Mrs Morgan said ministers would work with the unions and carry out a wider consultation among teachers to ‘craft a new deal for teachers that treats them as the professionals they are’. She also signalled a slight shift away from Mr Gove’s focus on academic rigour, which some critics had claimed was too narrow.

‘For too long there has been a false choice between academic standards and activities that build character and resilience,’ she said. ‘But the two should go hand in hand.’

Mrs Morgan said she wanted schools to help young people ‘develop character, resilience and grit’, adding: ‘As much as I want the next generation to be able to solve a quadratic equation, I also want them to be able to make a compelling pitch for a job and to be able to bounce back if things don’t work out.’

Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, welcomed Mrs Morgan’s approach, but said her words needed to be turned into action. ‘This was a well-delivered, well-crafted speech with welcome warm words for the teaching profession,’ she said. ‘Teachers will welcome the recognition that their professional lives are blighted by excessive workload.’

But Mrs Morgan also made it clear that she will continue many of Mr Gove’s reforms, saying the Conservatives were the ‘true progressives in education’.

She also announced plans to establish a further 35 free schools.
