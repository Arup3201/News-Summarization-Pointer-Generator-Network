A woman who was forced into marriage at the age of 14 while under the control of paedophile Mormon polygamist Warren Jeffs's cult has recounted her harrowing ordeal.

The woman, Elissa Wall, revealed how her own mother resorted to holding her daughter's hand at the altar in a bid to calm her down as she was forced to marry her 19-year-old cousin, whom she despised.

In a CNN interview, which is to be aired tonight, Elissa describes how she cried so much during the ceremony that her wedding dress was soaked with her own tears.

She told broadcaster Anderson Cooper: 'It was so devastating that even in the ceremony itself I'm crying to such a level that my wedding dress is soaked.

'They had my mother stand next to me and hold my hand just to get me to take my vows.'

Elissa is a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), a sect led by polygamist paedophile Warren Jeffs.

She left the church and divorced her cousin husband, with whom she had no children but endured repeated miscarriages.

Jeffs was jailed last month for life after a jury found him guilty of sexually assaulting two FLDS girls - aged 12 and 15 - who he married in FLDS religious ceremonies.

As Jeffs begins his life sentence in a
Texas, former members of the church have come forward to speak about 
the appalling abuse carried out within the sect, an extreme splinter group of the Mormon faith which believes in polygamy.

In tonight's interview, Elissa lifts 
the lid on the appalling abuse suffered by young members of the church -
and the seemingly powerless position of their parents and other adults.

'They had my mother stand next to me and hold my hand just to get me to take my vows'

She explained that women - like her mother - were so brainwashed by the church's indoctrination they were unable to protect their own children.

When asked by Cooper whether anyone tried to stop the arranged marriage or help her, Elissa said: 'Before my marriage had been commanded, we had been taken away from [my father] and he didn't fight for us.

'We were given to another man's children. My mother was resold to another man, and my mother didn't have the ability to say no.

'The women, especially my mother in the position she was in, they don't have the ability to protect their children.

'I was a representation of that. She couldn't step up and say, "no, my daughter is 14". She had been trained and indoctrinated her entire life.'

She has written a memoir called Stolen Innocence, which chronicles her ordeal at the hands of the extremist group.

Jailed for life: Warren Jeffs, shaven and dishevelled in his booking photograph, was in a coma after starving himself. He will be eligible for parole when he is 100.

Wallace Jeffs - the half-brother of Warren - will also appear in tonight's show. Wallace left the church and has three of his daughters living with him - but he is worried about those left behind.

He told Cooper: 'I'm very concerned. Very concerned about them getting married underage, being abused. I 
believe in the faith, but I don't believe in Warren Jeffs as the 
prophet. He's a fraud.'

Earlier this month it was revealed that sect leader Jeffs filed a handwritten motion seeking a new trial in Texas following his conviction.

Jeffs, who headed the Utah-based 
FLDS, has claimed his 
religious freedoms were violated by the courts â€“ a defence put forward during his trial.

In his motion, the 55-year-old said: 'The
Constitutional protection for religious faith and freedom of practice 
not being of full protection in previous trial ... is legal grounds 
sufficient to rule in favor of defendant allowed a new trial.'

Scrawled on one page in a lined notebook, Jeffs's self-penned motion was dated August 23 - two weeks after his conviction.

Jeffs'
filing also seeks a new hearing on the suppression of evidence from a 
2008 raid on the FLDS's Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado. Church and 
family records gathered in the raid were the basis for the case against 
Jeffs and other male members of the sect.

An appeal filed by Michael Emack, the
first of the sect men to be prosecuted by Texas authorities, was upheld
by the state's 3rd District Court of Appeals last month.

Emack, who is 
serving a seven-year sentence for assaulting a 16-year-old girl, argued 
the raid was unconstitutional.

A three-judge panel in Austin, Texas, said 
authorities had sufficient grounds for probable cause.

Jeffs had been held in a prison in Huntsville, Texas, immediately after his trial, but became ill after days of fasting.

He was taken to a hospital and was said to be in a medically-induced coma prior to being moved to Galveston.

Jason Clark, Texas
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman, said Jeffs 
remained at a prison hospital in Galveston and was listed in stable 
condition.

Jeffs won't be eligible for parole until he is 100.
