The motorhome is described as perfect for ‘feet-up relaxing and watching the world go by’. Certainly the Queen and Prince Philip were impressed by the £45,434 machine.

However, it’s doubtful, even at their age, that the royal couple could contemplate a retirement of leisurely travel.

They’re far too busy – and yesterday’s visit to a caravan factory in Bristol was yet another engagement in their schedule.

Going glamping, Your Majesty? The Queen steps out of a motorhome during a visit to Bailey Caravans in Bristol this morning

Wonder
 if she used the chemical loo? The Queen enjoys what Buckingham Palace 
have said is likely to be her first ever ride in a motorhome

They were taken for a brief ride in the 
giant motorhome, the Approach SE760, known at the factory as Mavis, and 
given a tour of the plant.

Aides said they believed it was first journey in such a vehicle for the 
couple, who are more accustomed to the royal train and the former royal 
yacht Britannia for mobile accommodation.

Nevertheless, the Queen, dressed in a vivid pink Stewart Parvin coat and
 hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, seemed genuinely impressed.

What a trip! The Queen can be seen enjoying the ride in the company's show motorhome, affectionately named Mavis

Next family holiday? The Royals were reportedly very impressed with the motorhome - although the Duke of Edinburgh offered the manufacturers some advice on design, saying he had designed his own horse boxes

Impressed: The Queen looked delighted to be shown around the motorhome

One's most excited! The Queen's trip in the motorhome was a first for the monarch, who had never set foot inside one before

Perhaps the 
walnut veneer interior reminded her of the carriages on the royal train.
 ‘It’s a real home-from-home,’ the 86-year-old monarch said as she and 
Prince Philip, 91, looked round. ‘Very nice.’

The Bailey factory, like the Queen and her husband, is celebrating its 
65th anniversary. As they sat inside the centrally heated motorhome, 
Bailey’s managing director Nick Howard talked them through the design, 
which includes three double beds and a iPod docking station.

‘This is palatial but perhaps not as palatial as they are used to – but 
you can fit a decent-sized family of six in here,’ he said afterwards.

All mod cons: The Queen was heard to remark that the motorhome was very well equipped

Not her natural habitat! The Queen is more used to lavish State rooms and private jets - but nonetheless entered into the motorhome trip with gusto

Royal approval: Prince Philip also took a look around the camper van and was understood to have given a suggestion on layout

Factory girl: The Queen was shown around the plant by staff members

'Home from home': But does Buckingham Palace look anything like the interior of the top of the range Approach SE 760?

 on: The Queen is attending a number of appointments in the city today, 
including a tour of successful motor manufacturers

The Duke amused the factory staff when he spotted assembly worker 
Stephen Brock wearing nine heavy gold chains around his neck and asked: 
‘You don’t believe in banks then?’ Mr Brock, 53, laughed and replied: ‘I
 love my gold.’

Sales director John Parker joked that he had hoped to secure an order 
for one of the motorhomes, but although they seemed fascinated by his 
sales patter, he came away without a sale, or any commission.

‘The Queen hadn’t brought her credit card and I know she doesn’t carry 
cash,’ he said.

‘My only regret is that we didn’t get an order. I’ll be 
following it up by the end of the week to see if they’ve decided on 
buying one.’
