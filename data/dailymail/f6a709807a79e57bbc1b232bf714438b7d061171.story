Surfers and swimmers beware. You may want to think twice about taking a dip at some of the States’ most picturesque beaches as they may not as inviting as you might think.

One in ten water samples from beaches from Los Angeles to New York have failed to meet safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

A new report has revealed that as well as getting a tan, holiday makers could pick up dysentery and hepatitis from some U.S. beaches.

One in ten water samples from beaches from Los Angeles to New York have failed to meet safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including a section of beach near Malibu Pier in California (pictured)

A total of 17 U.S. beaches have been found to have ‘persistent contamination problems’ with water samples failing to meet public health standards. They are:

California: Malibu Pier, in Los Angeles County

Indiana: Jeorse Park Beach in Lake County (Two sections failed)

Massachusetts: Cockle Cove Creek in Barnstable County

Maine: Goodies Beach in Knox County

New Jersey: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County

New York: Main Street Beach in Chautauqua County

New York: Wright Park – East in Chautauqua County

New York: Ontario Beach in Monroe County

Ohio: Lakeshore Park in Ashtabula County

Ohio: Arcadia Beach in Cuyahoga County

Ohio: Euclid State Park in Cuyahoga County

Ohio: Noble Beach in Cuyahoga County

Ohio: Sims Beach in Cuyahoga County

Ohio: Villa Angela State Park in Cuyahoga County

Ohio: Edson Creek in Erie County

Wisconsin: South Shore Beach in Milwaukee County

Around 3,500 samples were taken at beaches around the country in 2013, and those near the Great Lakes were the dirtiest, with high levels of bacteria. A total of 13 per cent of samples failed to meet basic standards.

It is thought that the water pollution has largely been caused by sewage and storm water overflowing, which often includes rubbish, oil and chemicals.

The EPA estimates that up to three-and-a-half million people become ill from contact with raw sewage from sanitary overflows each year.

‘There can 
be hidden dangers lurking in many of our waterways in the form of 
bacteria and viruses that can cause a great inventory of illnesses like 
dysentery, hepatitis, stomach flu, infections and rashes,’ said Steve 
Fleischli, water programme director for the Natural Resources Defence 
Council.

‘It's really all of our urban slobber going untreated into local waterways,’ he told CBS.

While
 35 ‘superstar' beaches were identified by the agency - such as Coquina Beach South in Florida and Wildwood Crest at Orchid in New Jersey - a list of 17 
‘repeat offenders’ that have serious pollution problems have been 
listed, including a picturesque spot in Malibu, California.

Individual states with the highest failure rates of reported water sampled, were Ohio, with 35 per cent, Alaska with 24 per cent and Mississippi with 21 per cent.

Delaware, New Hampshire and New Jersey were found to have the cleanest beaches.

The EPA’s report comes at a time when the agency is trying to strengthen pollution safeguards for two million miles of streams and wetlands, which are connected to large bodies of water.
