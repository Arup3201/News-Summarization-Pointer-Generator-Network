Forces charity Help for Heroes has announced it will not accept any donations raised by the leader of far-right political group the English Defence League.

Tommy Robinson's Just Giving page appears to have been shut down tonight after the charity said it was rejecting the money because it does not allow 'political fundraising'.

Help for Heroes said it will check for any further donations from EDL members and said they would not accept any money from the group.

Mr Robinson started fundraising after last week's murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, who was wearing a Help for Heroes t-shirt when he was murdered. 

Mr Robinson had raised more than £3,300 for the charity.

The EDL leader had planned a 17-mile walk across London in aid of the charity and was going to lay a wreath in Woolwich.

The Help for Heroes spokesman said: 'He's the only one that's come to our attention but tonight we'll be doing a cross-count to make sure that anyone else that's saying they're EDL will not be allowed to fundraise for us.

'It's the same for any political party, we don't allow political fundraising. As a charity, we're non-political.'

Up to 1,000 EDL members marched through London where they were marshalled by armed police

The announcement comes after up to 1,000 EDL members marched through London and clashed with anti-fascists yesterday. 

The group chanted 
‘no surrender’ and held pictures of a bloody meat cleaver as they 
marched past Downing Street.

Men carrying St George's Cross flags also chanted 'there's only one Lee Rigby' and 'Muslim killers off our streets'.

Hundreds of police in riot gear were deployed during the march.

Mr Robinson told the demonstration: 'This is a day of respect for our Armed Forces', and 'They've had their 
Arab Spring. This is time for the English Spring.'

Robinson wrote on his Twitter account that he was 'really gutted' at the decision.

He wrote: 'Shocked that political correctness has even gripped our armed forces charity. Amazed that a charity rejects a potential 100g.'

Previously he had written that he was aiming to raise £5,000 through the sponsored walk.

On the Just Giving page, he wrote: 'On Saturday the 29th June I am going to walk from Westminster in West London to Woolwich in East London (Just over 17 miles) to lay a wreath in support of our troops (Lee Rigby RIP). I plan to raise as much money as possible for Help for Heroes.

'As you can probably tell the last time I exercised was at school, I think a 17 mile walk might be end of me! The chance of me popping my clogs due to my fitness or the likely threat I will have from the religion of peace throughout the route might even tempt David Cameron and the rest of his weak leadership to sponsor me on the off chance that this was to happen!'
