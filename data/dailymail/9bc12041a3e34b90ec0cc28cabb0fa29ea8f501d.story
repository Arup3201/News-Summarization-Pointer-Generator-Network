They seemed like a dream couple. When Jack and Amanda got married ten years ago, their friends and families joked that they were joined at the hip.

'We spent every free minute with each other,' Amanda told me. 'We'd go for long walks and cook supper. We loved the cinema, entertaining friends, adventurous holidays - and we had a great sex life.'

But by the time Jack, 42, and Amanda, 41, came to see me for marital advice earlier this year, their pleasure in one another was a distant memory. It all changed when their children came along - daughter Emily, now eight, and their son, Tom, six. The couple admitted they had slept together only a handful of times since Tom's birth, had almost stopped talking to each other - and were at breaking point.

With their children now 'the centre of their lives', as they both proudly described it, they had moved out of London to a bigger house with a family-size garden. As a result, Jack was spending long hours commuting, while the couple's free time was dominated by Emily and Tom's needs and even their social lives.

'We just want the best for them,' explained Amanda. 'Like all their friends, our two have after-school clubs most evenings. I spend much of my time ferrying the children to and from school, piano lessons, dance classes and tutors. They have swimming on a Saturday morning, and birthday parties in the afternoon and on Sunday. If we do have any free time left at the weekend, I make sure we do things the kids enjoy.'

'With the children hanging on to me and calling for me all the time, I just don't have the energy to ask Jack about his day at work, let alone have sex with him'

That left Jack either falling asleep in front of the television after a long day at work or trying to be a 'good dad' by playing games with the children, with Amanda feeling ignored and under-valued at home as she struggled through the monotonous grind of cooking, cleaning and servicing the family's needs.

'With the children hanging on to me and calling for me all the time, I just don't have the energy to ask Jack about his day at work, let alone have sex with him.'

Jack too, was deeply unhappy, insisting he was the very last of Amanda's priorities, beneath the children, housework, shopping and the family dog. 'Sometimes I wish Amanda and I could have some days to ourselves, when we don't follow the kids' timetable,' he said. 'It would be nice to go out as a couple, but the kids make such a fuss about being left with babysitters that we can't relax.'

Worst of all, he confessed he and Amanda no longer slept in the same bed. 'The children have got into the habit of sleeping in our bed with Amanda, so it's just easier if I sleep in the spare room because I have to get up so early.'

Marriage killer: Many parents don't want to acknowledge how overindulging their child has placed a wedge between them (posed by models)

As a marital therapist, I have spent almost 30 years helping couples turn around their relationships and fall back in love again. I've written 11 books on the subject, answered countless letters to my website, given talks and appeared on numerous radio and TV shows. And it seems to me one fundamental issue is driving so much of the misery I encounter now: how to stop your children ruining your marriage.

I know from experience that most parents don't want to hear my message. When they are giving their all to their children, they don't want to think they might ironically be creating the wedge that will eventually force them apart. But 'red carpet' kids, as I call them, are an increasingly common phenomenon.

'Prioritise your child's football practice over household chores and everyone else's activities, and you send the message that they are all-important'

I've given them this nickname because, like mini-celebrities, who are cared for and indulged to the detriment of everyone else in the family. If you're not careful, they can kill your marriage stone dead.

So why do we do we spoil our children like this? Firstly, it makes life easier in the short-term. Jack and Amanda let their children sleep in their bed because a peaceful night in the spare room is easier than a full-on fight at bedtime.

Parental guilt also plays a part. There are any number of reasons for modern parents to feel guilty: not spending enough time with their children, not being able to afford everything their children want or need, losing their temper because they're stressed, not feeling 'good enough'... Children target adult guilt to get what they want.

And finally, we all want to be liked. Too many parents are so fearful of upsetting their children and losing their 'friendship', they struggle to discipline them effectively.

Survival guide: Andrew G Marshall has written a book on how to childproof your marriage

The long-term consequences of all this are just as disastrous for the child as the parents' relationship.

Prioritise your child's football practice over household chores and everyone else's activities, and you send the message that they are all-important. Too important, even.

Letting your child choose what you all eat, where you go and even their own bedtime sounds like every child's dream – but you are effectively making them 'head of the household'. Children who regularly wield this power at home struggle to make friends in the outside world as they haven't learned how to negotiate with, or defer to, others.

Nearing adulthood once meant new privileges and freedoms. But today's red-carpet children, who already have everything they could wish for and rarely hear the word no? They end up reluctant to leave home.

A lot of parents are so busy taking photographs and applauding as their children walk the metaphorical 'red carpet', they don’t see the problems they are creating until devastation is upon them. Don't let that be you.

As I explained to Amanda and Jack, change is always possible. Just because something has been done one way until now doesn't mean it must continue. By learning to apply some of my very simple rules for family harmony, Amanda and Jack were able to improve their relationships with each other and their children beyond all recognition.

So start rolling up the red carpet, and get your family and your marriage back on track too.

1.  Put your children last. Prioritising
your partner over your children is good for your marriage and your 
kids. Of course, there will be exceptions – if the children are ill, or 
their first day at school and so on, but otherwise make sure you and 
your partner go out for dinner together, send the kids to bed early, do 
things the two of you love to do together. A happy marriage makes happy 
children.

2. Be a 'good enough' parent. Accept
you're not perfect, that every parent makes mistakes and it's not the 
end of the world if you send your child to school in a hastily 
cobbled-together costume for the school play.

3. Recognise Your Needs. I
have met many mothers and fathers who, after years of downgrading their
own needs, felt 'entitled to do something for myself for once' - and 
had an affair. Always putting your children first can cause resentment 
to rebound in extraordinary acts of selfishness. Have a good think about
what YOU want and need in your relationship and family life – and make 
sure you get it.

4. Talk. Make
sure you talk through your problems – don't silently hope they'll go 
away. Problems fester if you don’t get them out in the open.

5. Put a lock on your bedroom door. You
wouldn't barge into a teenager's bedroom unannounced, so don't let your
children do it to you. Give yourself some privacy as a couple – they 
can always shout 'Fire!' if they're in trouble.

6.  Greet your partner first when he or she walks through the door – not your children. It shows how important they are to you.

7.  Don't let your children interrupt when you are talking to each other.

8. Make unilateral decisions about your children. Parent as a team and don't compete for popularity with your children.

9. Prioritise sex. Intimacy keeps a relationship alive. Send the children to the grandparents for the night. It's important.

10. Make the children responsible for tasks around the house, so there's more time for you to be partners rather than servants.
