This may be the most spoiled teenager the internet has ever seen – or a very successful troll.

'Lavish P', allegedly a 17-year-old from San Francisco, California, has become an internet celebrity after his Instagram feed began circulating the web.

His outrageous photographs show him bathing in cash, flaunting designer buys and tying wads of dollars to helium balloons.

Lavish brags about his wealth to 60,000 followers on Instagram and a further 20,000 on Twitter, who do not seem to be able to make up their minds whether he really is a super-rich teen or a troll.

His amazing 'life problems' posted on his Twitter account includes getting his arm hair caught in his 'new 89K Rolex' and not being able to read the menu at a five-star restaurant due to the ‘ambient lighting’.

He also complains that his mansion is so big his wireless internet does not cover all of it.

On his own website he describes himself as wealthy teenager from San Francisco, with a life which is ‘like Louis Vuitton - everyone wants it.

Writing about himself in third person, he adds: ‘Playing Polo and Golf are his favorite past times. Sipping cappuccinos in his multi-million dollar penthouse, he loves taking balling to a whole new level.

‘Your life saving are considered pocket change to him.'

Expensive habits: Lavish claims to only go to the bathroom if the toilet is filled with sparkling water

Tough times: The teenager owns so many iPhones that he struggles to fit them into his pockets

He explains that the reason for his outrageous behaviour is ‘because many peasants don’t understand what true luxury is’.

Peasant, a favourite word of Lavish’s,
 is how he describes the large majority of the population who does not 
share his luxurious life style, which according to Lavish also includes 
Kim Kardashian.

The teenager posted an online rant directed towards the reality-star calling her ‘poor’, ‘cheap’, and ‘lower class’.

'I'm richer than you and always will be,' he wrote in his grammatically incorrect attack.

'Please you only have a couple of Lamborghinis and a couple of ferraris [sic]. And only one rolls Royce [sic].'

Your house your [sic] buying is only 11m. Cheap.  Your[sic] a peasant. The true definition.'

Keeping it clean: Lavish washes his hands - only in sparkling water, obviously

Lavish flaunts his wealth in a number
 of ways, including doing 'cash givaways' and tying wads of cash to a 
balloon before watching it disappear in the sky.

He also claims only to go to the 
bathroom if the toilet is filled with sparkling water, which he 
allegedly also uses to wash his hands.

Although most people keep their money in the bank and pay by card, Lavish is a big fan of cash.

When he is not busy giving it away on 
Instagram he posts pictures where he bites it, uses it as a pretend 
phone, or 'bathes' in it.

However not everyone is buying what 
Lavish is selling. Since his extreme  displays of wealth hit the 
internet he has been accused of being everything from an arts project to
 a successful internet troll.
