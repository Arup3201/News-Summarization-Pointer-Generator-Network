Druids, vegans and green activists 
should be given special treatment at work, according to ‘lunatic’ advice
 from the equalities watchdog.

The
 Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) warns employers that they 
risk ‘potentially costly legal action’ unless they allow staff to follow
 their ‘religion or belief rights’ in the workplace.

This
 could include giving believers time off to go on pilgrimages, such as 
druids and pagans going to Stonehenge, while environmentalists should be
 free to lecture other staff about their car use.

Rights: The Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned employers that they should allow staff to follow their 'religion or belief rights' in the workplace, which could include giving pagans time off work to visit Stonehenge in Wiltshire

Druids should have the same rights at work as mainstream religious staff, according to the new guidelines

Vegetarian kitchen workers could 
refuse to do tasks that offend their beliefs, such handling meat.

Critics say that by the same logic vegans could refuse to work in an 
office furnished with leather chairs.

Even atheists should have their beliefs respected, according to the new guidance.

It has been issued in the wake of the landmark European Court of Human Rights ruling that Christians may wear a cross at work.

Vegetarians could also refuse to clean out fridges if they contain meat under the guidance

But
 rather than focusing on Christian rights in the workplace – which it 
insists are still strictly limited – the controversial quango suggests 
employers should give equal respect to fringe and non-religious groups.

The
 guidance is likely to be seen as an insult by some Christians and other
 religious observers as it appears to put lifestyle choices like 
vegetarianism on a par with their deeply-held spiritual beliefs. 
Officials insisted they were trying to be helpful by alerting businesses
 topotential legal pitfalls. But Tory MPs said the watchdog had gone 
‘many steps too far’ and warned that the guidance would have a damaging 
effect on employers, particularly small businesses.

Brian
 Binley, a member of the Commons business, innovation and skills 
committee, said the economy could not afford such ‘frivolous nonsense’.

He
 added: ‘We need to recognise the importance of people being able to 
earn a living. We need small businesses to be able to thrive, not to be 
weighed down with this sort of nonsense.’

Fellow
 Tory Philip Davies called for the quango to be scrapped. He said: ‘If 
anyone ever doubted that the EHRC is packed full of idiots who have no 
idea about the real world or running a business then this is all the 
evidence they need.’

Dominic
 Raab warned that the guidance could lead to a flood of vexatious legal 
claims.

Mr Raab, a Tory MP and former international lawyer, said: ‘This 
is a recipe for every crank and crazy to take their boss for a ride. The
 EHRC has become an expensive taxpayer-funded laughing stock.’

The
 guidance follows the successful bid by Christian British Airways worker
 Nadia Eweida to overturn a ban on wearing a small crucifix at work.

But the 12-page EHRC document makes it clear that the rights of Christians in the workplace are strictly limited.

It
 gives the example of a religious magistrate asking to be excused from 
dealing with cases involving the upbringing of children by gay couples.

The new advice comes after British Airways employee Nadia Eweida won her case at the European Court of Human Rights in January when it ruled that she had suffered discrimination at work because of her faith

The guidance suggests it would be reasonable to refuse the request because the rights of gay couples are more important.

But
 in other areas it suggests the Strasbourg court ruling could have a 
wide-ranging impact on the right of employees to express their religion 
and beliefs at work.

It says
 employers can refuse to consider a request if they suspect a belief is 
not sincerely held, but warns: ‘An employer should only question a 
belief in the most exceptional cases’.

Last
 night an EHRC spokesman said: ‘The Commission does not make the law on 
what is or isn’t a legitimate religion or belief. This is set by 
Parliament. It is important to remember that employers are not required 
to accept these types of request.

‘The
 Commission’s role is to provide free, expert advice to employers 
helping them understand and deal with what can be complex issues, and 
helping them avoid potentially costly legal action.’

The
 advice was welcomed by the Vegetarian Society, which said it gave 
official recognition that ‘vegetarianism can be, and indeed often is, a 
deeply held belief’.

The EHRC said although the recent cases at the European Court of Human Rights, pictured, were about Christians they had further 'implications' for employers
