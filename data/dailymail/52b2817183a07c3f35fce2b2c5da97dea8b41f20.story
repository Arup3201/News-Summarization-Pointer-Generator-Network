Researchers from Oxford University discovered birds with similar personalities flock together by tracking great tits, pictured, around Wytham Woods

Birds choose their friends and mates based not only on species, but also by personality, according to new research.

Shy male great tits tend to seek the company of other birds with the same disposition, claim scientists from Oxford University, while introverted adolescent birds are more likely to avoid the party crowd and keep to their own.

Researchers made the discovery after tracking thousands of birds with radio tags around Wytham Woods near Oxford, in a bid to map their social networks.

The study also found that shy birds of both sexes, while having smaller groups of 'friends' than their bolder counterparts, tended to form more stable relationships.

Lucy Aplin, from the university, said: 'There has been a lot of work describing the range of individual personalities in the great tit.

'Now we are linking it to the social networks and social organisation of the species, which hasn't been done before.'

The scientists recorded millions of visits made by the birds to 65 feeding stations over an entire winter to see how they interacted socially.

Birds were rated on a personality scale ranging from shy to bold, and individuals tested by introducing them to new environments.

Typically shy birds explored a strange environment very slowly, whereas bold birds carried out their recces quickly.

The birds' personalities were found to influence their social behaviour.

Bolder and more outgoing birds chose quantity over quality in their relationships. They had weaker associations with more birds than shy individuals, and foraged with several different groups.

'Measuring the social networks we could see that bolder birds tended to hop between foraging flocks and have short-term foraging associations, while shy birds tended to maintain a foraging association over a long time,' said Aplin.

Recent research from Laval University 
in Canada found that birds observe speed limits on roads even if 
motorists choose to ignore them.

On roads with higher speed limits, 
birds are quicker to take to the air to avoid oncoming traffic, but 
where limits are lower, they wait longer.

The behaviour is related to speed restrictions and not the result of birds assessing the speed of approaching vehicles.

'Shy birds are following a social strategy where they maintain a few strong and stable social associations to minimise risk.

'Hopping between many flocks may increase risks for bolder birds, but might maximise rewards through improving their social position and giving them better access to information, such as the location of food.'

While shy male birds tended to gravitate to similar individuals, shy females associated freely with all personalities, she said.

She added: 'We think shy male birds might group together to avoid the more aggressive bold birds.'

Professor Ben Sheldon, director of the Edward Grey Institute at Oxford University's Department of Zoology, said: ''By uncovering the way that different types of individuals interact non-randomly, we hope to understand how this controls the way that many processes work within populations.

'For instance, the way that information, and disease, spread in populations depends on the structure of the social network, and our work now tells us part of the reason for that structure.'

The findings are reported in the journal Ecology Letters.
