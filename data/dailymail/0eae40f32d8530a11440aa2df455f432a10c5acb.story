Dressed in a boiler suit and wearing a gas mask the figure strapped to a treadmill, bending and moving in a variety of bizarre poses looks more like something out of a Doctor Who episode than a member of the team at an American military hardware company.

But when the unusual attire is removed, the figure below the suit is not a human but a specially designed robot capable of carrying out some unsettlingly lifelike moves.

Known as PETMAN, this startling realistic robot has been created by Boston Dynamics to test out hazmat suits and a variety of military equipment.

Lifelike: It's almost impossible to believe that there is not a human inside this suit - it is an ultra realistic robot

Running man: PETMAN has been specially designed to test hazmat suits and a variety of military equipment

Testing: The robot, created by Boston Dynamics, balances on its own and is able to complete a number of lifelike movements simulating bending, walking and running

The state-of-the-art robot is an anthropomorphic creation designed to simulate how a soldier stresses protective clothing under realistic conditions.

Unlike previous suit testers that had a limited repertoire of motion and had to be supported mechanically, PETMAN can walk, bend and complete a variety of suit-stressing movements during exposure to chemical warfare agents.

It may look like it is attached to the treadmill - but the wires coming from it are merely to supply power - PETMAN balances itself and moves all on its own.

It also simulates human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature, humidity and sweating, all to provide realistic test conditions.

Let's dance: More akin to the terminator than your average member of staff, PETMAN can simulate human physiology inside military clothing

Amazing: The company announced the production of the robot in 2008 but many doubted that such realistic humanoid technology could be created

The company already wowed the world three years earlier when it produced its quadraped BigDog robot for the US military.

Billed as ‘the most advanced quadruped robot on Earth’, BigDog was devised to support American troops by carrying up to four packs of equipment on awkward terrain unsuitable for wheeled vehicles.

It announced the PETMAN project back in 2008 but many doubted that such realistic humanoid technology could be achieved.

The startlinglingly realistic robot is now at a testing facility where it is being put through its paces.

The next step is to put the robot into an exposure temperature where it will be tested against the likes of sarin and mustard gas.

Final stages: The PETMAN is currently at a testing facility and will soon be exposed to chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin

Not human: Looking more like a crash test dummy, the video shows the robot's movements without a hazmat suit on
