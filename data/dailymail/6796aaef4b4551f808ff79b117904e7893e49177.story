'Not only are the locations quintessentially poetic, but the trip features four poster beds, hot air ballooning, boat rides, flowers, chocolates, Champagne, exotic cuisine, and serenading musicians.'

This exceptional amorous adventure just launched on VeryFirstTo.com features the locations which have earned a place in the top ten of the most romantic destination league table (in order of popularity).

In conjunction with the trip, a survey was carried out by Hurlingham Travel on VeryFirstTo.com members of what they believed the most romantic destinations in the world to be.

While Paris has consistently topped previous surveys, Venice has eclipsed it thanks to its über evocative gondola rides, stirring opera, lavish baroque buildings and dreamy bridges, canals and piazzas.

It is no accident that this city is home to Casanova one of the world’s most famous lovers. 

Those surveyed were also especially influenced by the iconic monuments, beautiful architecture and mouth-watering food of Paris; the exquisite multi-coloured cliffs of Santorini (third spot); and the white sands, swaying palms and crystal blue waters of The Maldives (fourth).

In fifth came Florence, Italy, while sixth was Hawaii, famed for its luscious sands and surfing opportunities.

Rome, Italy came next in the list, followed by Saint Lucia in the Caribbean, Koh Samui in Thailand, with St Moritz rounding off the top ten.

A spokesperson for VeryFirstTo.com told MailOnline Travel: 'People should book this as it is the ultimate trip; the perfect trip to show the one you love how romantic you can be.

'The trip was designed with Hurlingham Travel and we specialise in creating never done before experiences and for Valentine's this year we wanted to create something special.' 

Rome, with its Vatican City view to St Peters Basilica over River Tiber is a beautiful spot and a key stop-off on the 30-day trip

The stunning sunset in Santorini will leave a memory to cherish forever for loved-up couples, and will leave you wanting more

Koh Samui in Thailand was named as the ninth most romantic place in the world, and forms part of the round-the-world trip
