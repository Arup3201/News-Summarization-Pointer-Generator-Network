Two thugs who terrorised vulnerable pensioners by filming themselves carrying out 'Jackass' style stunts have been spared jail.

Ian Hatwell, 32, and Scott King, 29, ambushed victims around Suffolk and Norfolk by pulling various pranks including asking for directions before blowing an air horn in their face or shouting insults.

The pair hoped to make money from their exploits - in the style of the American reality series - by recording them and turning the clips into a DVD which they could sell.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how they pulled up in a car beside one pensioner and asked directions before telling her: 'You're a bit of a c***'.

The woman told them to have a nice life as she walked away in Kessingland near Lowestoft, Suffolk and the man replied: 'Have a short life'. She later told police the jibe had made her feel 'sick'.

In another incident they approached a security guard at Pontins holiday camp in Pakefield, near Lowestoft, who had just had a hearing aid fitted.

They filmed him as they blew an air horn in his face, which he told the court left him 'shocked'.

A third victim was seen to have liquid, believed to be water, thrown at him as he was working on a wall in the town.

During an investigation, police found the DVD with 70 clips in 16 minutes of footage, which was taken in 2011 around parts of Suffolk as well as Gorleston in Norfolk and parts of Kent.

They had been called to the home of the parents of Hatwell's then partner who said they had some DVDs belonging to him in December 2013.

The footage showed that most of the abuse was filmed by King as he drove Hatwell around in his car. It also revealed another clip of Hatwell setting off a rape alarm in a Tesco supermarket.  

A laptop was also recovered showing other images of abuse.

Michael Crimp, prosecuting, said people's reactions varied on the video from distress to not being particularly bothered and walking away.

The court heard how PC Kevin Durrant who investigated the footage had found it to be 'completely abhorrent'.

Hatwell, of Lowestoft, and Scott, of Norwich, previously admitted an offence under the Public Order Act.

Judge David Goodin, hearing the case at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) described them as 'hooligans' and ordered each of them to do 200 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order

During police interviews about the incidents, which occurred over a three-month period in 2011, King and Hatwell expressed remorse and said the DVDs were never sold on.

Judge David Goodin described them as 'hooligans' and ordered each of them to do 200 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order.

Judge Goodin said: 'This course of conduct which might have been fashionable at the time actually was bullying, cruel and frightening because you picked on vulnerable victims and gave them the fright of their lives.

'No middle-aged matron is going to be other than appalled by "you're a bit of a c***" and "have a short life".

'It was pitifully pathetic, puerile, immature and just plain stupid which mitigates to some extent any intention to be deliberately cruel.

'I accept that you have both grown up a bit.'

Andrew Thompson, defending Hatwell, said: 'It was appalling behaviour. It's behaviour that's profoundly regretted by Mr Hatwell.'

Laura Kenyon, defending King, said his adolescent immaturity had 'trickled over into adulthood' and he did not appreciate the effect of his actions at the time.

Bob Blizzard, the Labour parliamentary candidate for Waveney, north Suffolk, said after the hearing: 'I think the sentence is wholly inadequate.

One of the victims was a security guard at Pontins in Pakefield, who had recently had a hearing aid fitted

'This is effectively violence against a person and older people could have had trauma, heart attacks or all kinds of things.

'I think they should have gone to prison. It's disgraceful behaviour and the fact they were filming it shows it was pre-meditated and makes it even worse.'

Peter Aldous, the Conservative MP for Waveney said: 'It's appalling, pre-meditated and there was intent to make money.

'However, they have shown remorse. I would just ask the question of whether this was the maximum sentence they could have got without a custodial sentence? Could they have got a longer period of community work?'

A Suffolk Police spokesman said after the hearing: 'There is no doubt that their behaviour, as demonstrated by the DVD, would have caused distress to the people targeted, with older residents being subjected to verbal abuse at the roadside and, in some cases, an air horn being used to frighten people.

'They will now have to face the consequences of their actions and we hope this will go some way to reassuring those who were subjected to these incidents.'

Tim Passmore, the Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner, said: 'There is absolutely no excuse whatever for such disgraceful behaviour.

'I don't believe for one moment their intentions weren't deliberate as they filmed the sorry episodes.

'These are two supposedly adult individuals and they need to understand the impact of their obscene behaviour.

'I hope that while they serve their community sentences they are made to reflect on their despicable actions and the huge distress caused.'
