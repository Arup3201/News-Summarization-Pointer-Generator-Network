Prospering: London Transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy's pay was doubled after he was awarded a bonuses totalling a huge £319,000

Transport bosses have been awarded two years’ worth of deferred bonuses thanks to their ‘impressive’ performance during the Olympics.

The biggest winner was Transport for London commissioner Sir Peter Hendy, who nearly doubled his pay packet. He took home more than £652,000 after receiving bonuses totalling £319,000.

Sir Peter topped the pay list, but three of the capital’s transport chiefs earned more than £500,000 in total, with 12 taking home more than £300,000.

Top staff were told their bonuses for the last two years would be deferred until after the Games, with payment dependent on the quality of the transport service during the Olympics.

Paralympic gold medallist  Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who is paid £25,000 to chair the remuneration committee that approved the pay packages, said: ‘London’s transport network had a record-breaking year with hugely improved reliability and tremendous support for a  successful London 2012 Games under the gaze of the world.

‘Based on this impressive level of performance and delivery, the remuneration committee decided it was right that the deferred performance awards for the two years before the Games should be paid in full.’

Sir Peter said the figure was justified because TfL successfully reached nearly all of its targets.

He added: ‘I have never worked so hard in my life as in the Olympic year. Neither have my colleagues.’

However critics claimed their success 
was partly thanks to costly deals with transport unions, who agreed not 
to strike during the Games.

And others recalled the ‘scare  tactics’ employed by officials – who urged people to work from home.

They also set up reserved lanes to speed VIPs to their destinations, with fines for anyone who strayed into them.

TfL said Tube customer satisfaction 
was at an all-time high of 84 per cent during the Olympics, while bus  
passenger satisfaction hit a record level of 82 per cent.

They
also pointed out that Sir Peter and TfL’s other chief officers had seen
their basic pay frozen for a fourth consecutive year.

But
Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: ‘It is 
outrageous that the top brass across TfL are raking in such huge 
bonuses.

‘Our union will take the loadsamoney culture at the top into full account as we make our own pay claims.’

And
Labour’s London Assembly transport spokesman Val Shawcross said: 
‘Transport for London’s bonus pot will come as a surprise to Londoners 
who have been forced to pay through the nose just to get to work.’
