Jenson Button's future at McLaren appears assured as the team draw ever closer to announcing their driver line-up for next season.

Despite retiring from Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix and failing to be classified at the end of a race for the first time in two years, the 34-year-old showed no qualms when asked about his fate for 2015.

Speaking to Press Association Sport, Button said: 'I'm not worried in any way about that.

'I'm pretty happy I'll be here next year, and I feel I'm doing a good job right now.

'I just have to sort Saturdays (in qualifying) a bit more. I've been a bit unlucky and not got the best out of it every weekend, which annoys me more than anything else, but I'll get there.'

Racing director Eric Boullier has revealed talks between himself and McLaren Group chairman and CEO Ron Dennis are moving on apace.

Earlier this month Dennis promised a definitive decision would be announced by the end of the season in Abu Dhabi in eight weeks' time.

'We make progress every day, although there is absolutely no plan to announce anybody yet,' said Boullier.

'It's down to Ron and I, but Ron has the last call as the owner and chairman of the company, although when it comes to protocol it is the board that has the last call.

'But Ron and I generally agree. On this subject (of the drivers) we are quite transparent and open together.

'We have our view, and have some preferences in the timing, but we are okay on what we expect, what we want, where we want to go, and it's working okay.'

With Honda coming on board as power-unit supplier next year, with the Japanese manufacturing giant replacing Mercedes, Button is already looking ahead as to the difficulties likely to be faced.

'I know Honda will be giving everything to be competitive from the word go,' said Button. 'But Formula One is so competitive now, and Mercedes have done a great job.

'It's always going to be tricky to challenge someone like that who already have the experience of the engine. There will definitely be a learning curve.'
