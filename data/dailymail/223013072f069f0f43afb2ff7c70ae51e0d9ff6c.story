Nancy Dell'Olio has revealed she has faked orgasms in the past, but only to make her man feel better.

Speaking live on today's This Morning, the Italian-American lawyer and ex-girlfriend of former England manager Sven-Goran Erikkson said faking orgasms was an act of generosity, kindness and love, and frequently done by women who are much more 'complicated' to pleasure than men and find it tricky to reach,

Nancy also said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for a man to pretend to climax, despite appearing on the ITV talk show alongside former Loaded editor Martin Daubney, who said he has faked it in the past.

Nancy Dell'Ollio appeared live on ITV this morning to talk about faking orgasms

The pair were speaking with presenters Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield, and sex and relationships expert Susan Quilliam, in light of a new book, Why Men Fake It: The Totally Unexpected Truth About Men And Sex by Abraham Morgentaler, which says that increasing numbers of both women and men are faking their orgasms during sex.

Morgentaler's research shows that 74 per cent of women and 22 per cent of men fake orgasms to make their partners feel better.

Dell'Olio said: 'I can't remember the circumstances of faking it but he was trying and to make him feel better I faked it. Of course. Women are more complicated than men and it is more difficult for us to achieve orgasm. But it is surely more difficult for men to get away with.'

Dell'Olio appeared alongside writer Martin Daubney, who said that he had also faked orgasms in the past with ex-lovers

Daubney said he used to fake orgasms with an ex-partner because she was unreliable about taking her contraceptive pill and he wasn't ready to have children, so to avoid arguments about using condoms he would lie.

He added: 'People think that sex is all about orgasms for men. In actual fact we're much more sensitive souls than you'd believe.

'There's an expectation on men, so they get anxious, and if you're anxious it's more difficult to reach an endgame.'

Holly wondered how men could 
physically fake orgasms, pointing out that there are 'telltale signs'. 
Daubney said that the book reveals that two-thirds of men get away with 
it... but one third don't.

Quilliam
explained that if everyone fakes it, nobody will ever learn what 
they're doing wrong. She said: 'It's about generosity and love. We do it
for the best reasons, but it's not the best way to love.

'The best way 
is to have conversation. If you're faking it, either the conversation or
stimulation is wrong.'

Nancy Dell'Ollio, Martin Daubney and Susan Quilliam appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss whether or not people ought to fake orgasms with partners

Holly Willoughby wondered how men could fake orgasm, asking: 'Aren't there telltale signs?'

She
added that the best way to stop having to fake it is to talk about sex 
with your partner, stressing that during such an intimate conversation 
you must be careful not to issue blame; to highlight that you want to 
make the relationship even better, and to make it a calm, measured 
conversation rather than one fraught with emotion.

In an audience poll 60 per cent of people said it was OK to fake an orgasm while 40 per cent said it wasn't.
