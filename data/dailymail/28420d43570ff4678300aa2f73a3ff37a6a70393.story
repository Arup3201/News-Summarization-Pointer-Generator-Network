After a difficult encounter with Switzerland, Javier Mascherano does not deny that Argentina need to improve if they are going to progress beyond their quarter-final encounter with Belgium. 

‘The moment of truth has arrived,’ said the Barcelona and former Liverpool midfielder. ‘Now we have to maintain the level and get rid of the mistakes.’ 

Had Switzerland been more clinical in front of goal, Argentina could already be out of this World Cup. But they survived the many opportunities the Swiss had, securing victory and their passage to the last eight with a goal from Angel Di Maria only two minutes before the end of extra time.

‘It’s very difficult,’ he said. ‘But it’s not just about what we’re missing. I like to look at positive aspects. In a World Cup that is so difficult, where it costs so much to go through, we have made good strides forward.

‘In the second half of extra-time Switzerland had less legs. They couldn’t attack in the same way. We could press higher, and we started to win a lot of the ball in their half. But you know that with one mistake you’re going home.’ 

Mascherano is encouraged by the success the South American teams have so far enjoyed, even if it is the Central Americans from Costa Rica he considers the major threat to the ambitions of the so-called bigger teams.

‘The South Americans, while one or two have gone out, have put in a very respectable performances,’ he said. ‘Obviously we’re seeing a very different World Cup. South America, it’s not the same to play in as Europe.

‘There’s been an evolution. Today you have countries who, historically, don’t have such a football tradition but they’ve evolved; they’ve made a stride forward. 

‘Costa Rica are getting their reward for being a brave side. They’re a team that likes to play, that I love to watch because they never depart from their style of play. 

‘I said it when they won their first game, against Uruguay; they’re a squad who invite others to copy them.

‘Colombia, well, they’re a fine team. It’s something we knew from qualifying. Jose Pekerman has done extraordinary work with very young players with great potential.

‘It’s a bit of a lottery too. Chile could well have gone through. It would have been deserved. I think they put in a very respectable display. They’ve grown a lot and, above all, they never deviated from their idea. That’s the identity of a team.’

Mascherano thinks it difficult to identity a favourite from the eight remaining sides.

‘I’ve read that it’s the World Cup with the most goals, where there are a lot of entertaining games, where there are a lot of great match-ups,’ he said. 

‘There aren’t too many big gaps between teams. For the supporters, that’s great. I don’t think it’s fair to say anyone’s been a surprise but you have to mention Costa Rica, who are doing something extraordinary.’
