A drought emergency has been proclaimed in California after a wildfire that erupted early Thursday morning claimed 17 structures, including a guesthouse that was part of the Singer estate.

At least 10 renters were left homeless when the fire destroyed the garage and rental rooms above it as well as the guesthouse on the historic grounds of a retreat that once was the summer home of the Singer sewing machine family.

Statues of Jesus and Mary stood unharmed near the blackened ruins. However, the main mansion, built in 1924 and a designated Glendora Historic Landmark, was spared.

Governor Jerry Brown has formally proclaimed California in a drought Friday,
 saying the state is in the midst of perhaps its worst dry spell in a 
century and the conditions are putting residents and their property in 'extreme peril.'

Brown made the announcement in San Francisco amid increasing pressure 
from lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and as 
firefighters chased flare-ups in the wildfire that has
 kept thousands of people from their homes.

The proclamation 
allows California to request a broad emergency declaration from 
President Barack Obama, which would expedite some water transfers, 
provide financial assistance and suspend some state and federal 
regulations.

The fire around Glendora has swept through about two-and-a-half square miles of tinder-dry chaparral and destroyed five homes. It is 30 per cent contained.

'It's really a miracle that our chapel, our main house is safe,' owner of the Singer estate Jeania Parayno said.

Alex Larsen, 50, rented a room at the estate. The musician had lived there for about four years.

'All my possessions are toast, burned toast,' he told the Los Angeles Times.

Another tenant, Rudy Rosas, told the Daily News that he didn’t have time to grab anything but his birth certificate, wallet and a spare shirt before running from the house.

'I lost everything,' Rosas said. 'My room is destroyed. It’s just a wall, my window, and everything behind it is just debris.'

Firefighters were chasing early-morning flare-ups Friday in a damaging wildfire that was largely tamed but kept thousands of people from their homes in the foothill suburbs northeast of Los Angeles.

Spots of open flames chewed through brush along hillsides, raining embers and ash onto communities abutting the San Gabriel Mountains as crews doused properties in the path of the fire. Firefighters working overnight lit controlled backfires to cut down on fuel for the blaze.

Drought: Water levels for many of California's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977

An acrid smoggy haze descended across the Los Angeles basin all the way to the coast.

The National Weather Service said a red-flag warning of extreme fire danger in effect much of the week would remain in place until Friday evening because of low humidity and the chance of the region's notorious Santa Ana winds gusting to 30 mph in the foothills and canyons.

'We build up a little bit of confidence,' Los Angeles County fire Deputy Chief John Tripp said, 'but we always still have a threat.'

'Fire season just didn't end this year,' Los Angeles County fire Inspector Scott Miller said.

Some 3,700 people from Glendora and Azusa evacuated at the height of the fire, county emergency officials said. Glendora residents were allowed to return home Thursday evening, but homes in Azusa remained under evacuation orders. More than 2,000 people remained evacuated, according to KABC-TV.

Fire engines would stay in all the endangered neighborhoods through the night and helicopters were available to fly after dark if it became necessary, Tripp said.

Nighttime gusts brought a few flare-ups, but they remained within fire lines.

Two firefighters had minor injuries and a woman trying to fight the blaze near her home suffered a minor burn, Tripp said.

Seventeen structures were damaged, including homes, garages, barns and other buildings, he said.

Three men in their 20s, including a homeless man, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting the blaze by tossing paper into a campfire in the Angeles National Forest, just north of Glendora. They could face state or federal charges.

According to Fox LA, those arrested were Clifford E. Henry Jr., 22, of Glendora; Jonathan C. Jarrell, 23, of Irwindale; and Steven R. Aguirre, 21, a homeless man from Los Angeles.

Glendora Chief Tim Staab said the men were trying to keep warm and the wildfire appears to have been an accident.

'One was very remorseful for starting this fire,' he said.

The Angeles National Forest was under 'very high' fire danger restrictions, which bar campfires anywhere except in fire rings in designated campgrounds.

The mountains rise thousands of feet above dense subdivisions crammed up against the scenic foothills. Large, expensive homes stand atop brush-choked canyons that offer sweeping views of the suburbs east of Los Angeles.

Whipped by Santa Ana winds, the fire quickly spread into neighborhoods where residents were awakened before dawn and ordered to leave.

'They're a little nervous, but I'm keeping calm for them,' she said. 'I've been loading the car up with important papers and getting the kids dressed. We'll just take some essentials and get going if we have to.'

However, other homeowners chose to stay, despite firefighters' orders to get out. Some wore masks against the ash and smoke as they wetted down their properties with garden hoses.

The last catastrophic fire in the San Gabriel Mountains broke out in 2009 and burned for months, blackening 250 square miles, killing two firefighters and destroying more than 200 structures, including 89 homes.

The new fire could have abundant fuel to consume. Vegetation above Glendora, an upper-middle-class suburb of about 50,000 people, had not burned since a 1968 fire that was followed by disastrous flooding in 1969.

Many homes are nestled in rugged canyons and ridges that made access difficult.

More than 700 firefighters were on the scene, along with 70 engines and a fleet of helicopters and air tankers dropping water and retardant.

The smoke was visible from space in satellite photos. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a smoke advisory and urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities in directly affected areas.
