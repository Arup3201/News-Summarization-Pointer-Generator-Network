Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed will miss England's Four Nations campaign after dislocating his shoulder for the third year in a row.

The 26-year-old Yorkshireman sat out the 2013 World Cup after dislocating his shoulder last September and is due to undergo further re-constructive surgery after suffering a repeat injury during the Broncos' 22-12 loss to Melbourne on Friday.

Reed's 33rd-minute try had brought his side back in contention at 12-10 but his night was cut short shortly afterwards when he dislocated his shoulder while making a charge in the final play of the first half.

'He's dislocated his shoulder unfortunately and that's the third year in a row,' Brisbane coach Anthony Griffin said.

'He'll probably have to have a reconstruction, which is disappointing for Jack, he's been in really good form.'

Reed, who was born in Silsden, near Keighley, but raised in Queensland, made his England debut against France three years ago and played in the final of the 2011 Four Nations Series against Australia at Elland Road.
