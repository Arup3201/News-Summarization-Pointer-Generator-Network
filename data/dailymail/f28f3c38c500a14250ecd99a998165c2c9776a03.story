A senior Sun journalist was cleared yesterday of paying a corrupt tax official to get secrets from the Government’s Budget.

Clodagh Hartley, 40, was accused of handing over £17,000 in exchange for leaks from Alistair Darling’s Budget in 2010 and embarrassing information about revenue officials and government waste.

But yesterday the former Whitehall editor was acquitted of corrupting public officials after telling jurors she was just ‘doing her job’ getting stories that were in the public interest and exposing Whitehall ‘spin’.

The mother of two is the first Sun journalist charged under Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden, the investigation into alleged cash payments to public officials for stories, to be cleared.

She maintained that her source, Jonathan Hall was a ‘whistleblower’ at HMRC where he worked as chief of the law enforcement desk.

But it can now be revealed that Hall, 43, had previously pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office after receiving £17,475 over more than three years from The Sun for sensitive information on Alistair Darling’s final Budget in 2010 and stories on celebrities.

The ‘greedy’ civil servant used the account of his girlfriend Marta Bukarewicz, 45, to hide most of the payments, but she was cleared of any wrongdoing.

Miss Hartley sobbed in the dock yesterday, saying ‘thank you’, as she was cleared of paying out ‘easy money for lazy journalism’.

She was arrested in 2012 after police were handed emails, texts and payment records containing evidence that Hall fed her stories between 2008 and 2011.

Her three week trial at the Old Bailey heard that in March 2010 Hall was paid £750 for a double-page spread about policy decisions relating to the Budget and the Government’s deficit reduction plans.

He was also paid £500 for a story in December 2009 about celebrities including Kelly Brook being paid as part of a £1.3 million taxpayer-funded TV campaign publicising the Government website Directgov.

Jonathan Hall will be sentenced on February 6 after earlier pleading guilty to misconduct in public office

Prosecutor Zoe Johnson, QC, told jurors: ‘This is not a trial involving whistleblowing in a noble cause. It is a case in which Hall, the HMRC press officer, was motivated by greed and Miss Hartley, the journalist, was motivated by acquiring the next big scoop or exclusive.’

But Alexandra Healy QC, defending, said: ‘What it amounts to is she is on trial for that criminal offence for doing her job.

‘She made no secret of what she was doing.

‘Miss Hartley admits she requested that her employers paid money to Jonathan Hall and makes no secret of what she is doing.

‘We have to look at Miss Hartley’s actions on basis of the factual circumstances at the time and how political journalism has operated for years.’

During her trial, the journalist hit out at News International’s decision to hand over vast swathes of data to police comprising journalists’ confidential sources.

She said it never occurred to her that she was doing anything illegal.

The reporter, who had stints as The Sun’s Los Angeles correspondent as well as consumer affairs editor, said she wrote the Budget article because it was important for readers to get the story before it was subjected to ‘spin’.

She argued other articles about a £1.3m campaign to promote a government department and the £24m cost of moving a schools authority from London to Coventry were in the public interest.

She also said she wanted to expose the double standards amongst civil servants in Whitehall, where the culture of spin made it difficult to get to the truth.

Former Mirror editor and media commentator Roy Greenslade, who gave evidence in her defence, insisted that leaks were the ‘lifeblood’ of political journalism in Britain.

Jurors learnt that a series of articles supposedly based on confidential information bought by Hartley were irrelevant to the case.

One article, ‘£20bn Black Hole Cheers’, printed on 26 March, 2010, was written two days after Labour’s 2010 Budget and contained nothing confidential.

Another article uncovered by detectives was not even written by Hartley.

Richard Lester, head of security at HMRC, admitted his department did not even looked into the supposedly damaging leaks at the time they were published.

Hall, who joined HMRC in 2009, received more than £4,000 directly from News International between April 2008 and May 2010.

A further £13,000 was channelled into his girlfriend’s account between June 2010 and July 2011.

Miss Bukarewicz, who denied profiting £845 from the alleged scam, said Miss Hartley had suggested the arrangement to Hall because he was a ‘protected source’ and it was ‘standard practice at the Sun’.

But after nearly two days of deliberations, the jury cleared her and Miss Bukarewicz of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.

Yesterday Miss Hartley left court in tears. She has said she does not plan to return to journalism.

Hall will be sentenced on February 6.
