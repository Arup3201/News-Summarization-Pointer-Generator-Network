Radio icon Casey Kasem's daughter has sued a weight loss
expert because she claims that the medication he gave her only made her gain
wait.

In addition, Liberty Kasem believes that the treatment plan
she was put on by Dr. Edgar Guess harmed her health.

TMZ reports that Liberty Kasem has filed a lawsuit against
the doctor, who runs the Beverly Hills Wellness Center.

Lawsuit: Liberty Kasem believes that the treatment plan she was put on by Dr. Edgar Guess harmed her health

Early years: Liberty Kasem, seen here with her parents in 2000, claims that the negative side effects began six months after seeking help losing weight

Ms Kasem, an aspiring singer, reportedly sought his help in
2012 when she was prepping for a music video shoot.

She claims that he suggested she start a regamine of
medication- the brands of which have not been publicly disclosed- as well as
vitamins and supplements. Six months after she was first put on the regimen, she began to sweat profusely and vomit- to the extent that she began to fear for her life.Â 

Liberty, who is believed to be 24 years old, is the daughter
of entertainment icon Casey Kasem and his wife Jean.

This is just the latest legal drama for the family as
Liberty's step-siblings accused her mother, Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years
Jean, of effectively holding him hostage.

Stripped: Jean Kasem, seen last week with Liberty by her side, has been stripped of guardianship over her husband

On Friday, Jean Kasem said that her husband is getting the
best possible care and she is 'not going to allow anybody to shred (her) family
on unfounded facts and malicious accusations' of elder abuse.

In a video statement provided to King5.com,
 Jean Kasem says her step-daughter Kerri's legal maneuverings to gain 
control over her father are motivated by nothing more than money.

She says that the rift Kasem has with his daughter from
another marriage is based on her participation in the Church of Scientology.

'Casey never agreed with his eldest daughter's - from a
prior marriage of over 40 years ago - involvement with the Church of
Scientology and does not want her involved in his medical or estate affairs,'
Jean Kasem says in her televised statement.

Victory: Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter from another marriage, is fighting Jean over guardianship over her father

The Church: Jean Ksaem says Kerri's involvement with the Church of Scientology is why Casey doesn't want her involved in his medical decisions

'If the judge in these highly suspicious preceedings does
not see the monetary motive behind these fraudulent petitioners, then something
is seriously wrong and unjust here,' she continued. 'The abuse of the legal
process has been seriously violated and should be looked into by the
appropriate judicial committee immediately without any further delay.'

Jean Kasem says she has proof that several law enforcement
agencies that have checked in on her ailing husband have all said that he seems
alert and in good spirits.

'My husband is very happy and comfortable
 in our family and has told me time and time again that he wishes to 
remain under my care,' she said in an interview with KING-TV.
