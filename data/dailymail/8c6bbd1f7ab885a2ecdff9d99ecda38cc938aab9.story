A sly fox attempting to catch a meal was left with its tail between its legs - after being chased away by a pair of angry birds.

The cranes spotted it eyeing up their chicks and formed a barrier in front of their young before aggressively darting towards the fox.

Mark Hughes, a photographer from Tewkesbury, captured the scene while visiting the WWT Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire.

He was waiting inside a hide to take pictures of the oldest birds, who are fondly known to locals as Monty and Christine, when they returned to their nest after a forage.

Mr Hughes, 46, then noticed the fox waiting to pounce out of the corner of his eye and grabbed his camera as the scene unfolded.

He said: 'Suddenly, from the left, appeared a fox whose only intention was to find an easy meal.

When the crane started advancing the fox made a speedy exit to the relief of Mr Hughes who was photographing the event from the distance

'As the fox got closer the cranes began to show clear signs of distress and seemed to usher their chicks to a position where they stood as a barrier to the advancing predator.'

'There was a short standoff, then suddenly both birds launched themselves at the fox - determined to drive it away.

'On this occasion they were successful and there was a huge feeling of relief.'
