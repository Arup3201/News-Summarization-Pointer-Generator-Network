A pregnant woman who drove a minivan, with her three young children strapped inside it, into the ocean off a Florida beach has been charged with attempted murder.

Ebony Wilkerson had her bail set at $1.2 million on Saturday and remained in custody after the shocking incident at Daytona Beach on Tuesday.

A tourist filmed the dramatic rescue of Wilkerson's three children, aged 3, 9. and 10, as they cried for help as giant waves pounded their vehicle.

Custody: Wilkerson, pictured in court Saturday, is being held on $1.2 million bail after being accused of trying to kill her children

The children had lowered the windows to 
scream for help, and the oldest child could be seen trying to wrest 
control of the steering wheel from her mother, investigators said.

Arrest: Ebony Wilkerson, 32, faces attempted murder and child abuse charges

Wilkerson got out of the 
van and allegedly tried to block a beach safety officer from getting to the 
children, a witness told investigators.

The 32-year-old from South Carolina has been charged with three counts of first-degree attempted murder and three counts of child abuse.

According to an arrest affidavit, she had arrived in Florida three days before the incident, and was trying to escape an abusive marriage.

The children told investigators their mother had been acting 'crazy' since they arrived in Florida, and Wilkerson's sister tried twice to get mental health treatment for her the day before she drove the van into the water, the affidavit said.

Officers from Daytona Beach Police, who evaluated Wilkerson before the incident, decided that she did not qualify for involuntary mental health confinement, the affidavit said.

Her children are currently in state custody.

Good Samaritans and lifeguards had come to their aid, rushing into the Atlantic to remove them from the vehicle as it filled with water.

In
 response to questions about Wilkerson’s mental state, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson 
stated on Friday that investigators have found no information suggesting 
that the suspect was suffering from any psychiatric or emotional issues.

Johnson
 explained that the decision to charge Wilkerson in connection to the 
incident was based on several factors, including interviews with 
witnesses and the woman’s children, who told deputies that their 
mother drove the minivan straight into the surf.

Johnson added that when questioned by police, Wilkerson claimed that she had tried to drive out of the ocean, but eyewitnesses insisted that she was going in the opposite direction and then tried to hamper the rescue efforts, suggesting intent to kill them.

‘She tried to stop one of the beach rangers from getting into the window,’ Johnson said.

The sheriff also revealed that Wilkerson's young son tried to fight his mother in a bid to gain control of the steering wheel.

‘She actually told them, "close their eyes and go to sleep, mama's taking him to a better place,"' the law enforcement official said.

Wilkerson, who is 28 weeks' pregnant with her fourth child, was described by officials as calm, cooperative and 'very lucid'.

Wilkerson was stopped in her vehicle by police officers two hours before she 
drove into the ocean. Her sister called police after becoming worried because Wilkerson 
had been talking about demons.

The officers found her lucid and let her go, Police Chief Mike Chitwood said.

According
 to Wilkerson's sister, Jessica Harrell, the 32-year-old woman was 
trying to escape from an abusive spouse when she drove from her home in 
South Carolina to stay with her in Florida. 

'Her
 husband beat on her, so she came down to my house from South Carolina,'
Jessica Harrell said in a call to a 911 dispatcher just hours before 
Wilkerson drove her minivan into the 
surf.

Harrell, 28, asked the
 operator to send officers to perform a welfare check because her 
sibling appeared emotionally distraught.

'She's
 talking about Jesus, that there are demons in my house, that I'm trying
 to control her, but I'm trying to keep them safe,' Harrell said on the 
call.

The woman revealed that she made an attempt to take Wilkerson to a hospital the day before, but the 32-year-old left.

When
 officers caught up with Wilkerson and interviewed her, the woman 
allegedly told them that she was heading to a shelter for abused women. 
She also added that she was going to her ‘safe place'.

Wilkerson
 was let go because she did not meet the criteria to be detained under 
the Florida Mental Health Act, which allows people to be involuntarily 
committed if they appear to present a danger to themselves.

In the 911 call, Harrell said that she had tried to take her sister to a shelter, but it had no vacancies.

Police in Myrtle Beach said Wilkerson filed a domestic violence report March 1, accusing her husband of sexually assaulting her.

Court records uncovered by the Post and Courier indicate that Wilkerson was married to Lutful Ronjon, 31, of Cross, who was arrested in May 2005 on domestic battery charges.

The report stated that Ronjon beat up his wife during an argument about receipts while the couple were vacationing in Myrtle Beach.

The battery charge was later dismissed after Ronjon underwent a domestic violence pre-trial service program. 

The Post and Courier in Charleston also found that Wilkerson was involved in a deadly crash in Delray in February 2007.

On
 the day of the accident, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate 
95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan driven by Douglas Krane, of Fort Lauderdale.

The
 impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete 
barrier. The driver's wife, Jennifer, suffered critical injuries in the 
collision and died several days later.

Wilkerson
 was cited for improper lane change, lost her license for a year and was
 ordered to serve 132 hours of community service, according to court 
records.

In video of the rescue at the beach this week, taken by Simon Besner, a 
tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards
 try to pull her children from the vehicle.

Witnesses
 described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children 
remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her 
under the van.

'It was a bit terrifying,' Besner said.

In the video, several men frantically 
try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's 
side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan.

The small child is eventually pulled to safety. Another tourist described watching with horror.

Help: The woman's sister called police and 
warned them that she was talking about demons, prompting them to do a 
welfare check but they released her because she was lucid

'My
 friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the 
beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin 
visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6.

'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.'

'That's
 when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out 
two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and 
brought a little toddler out of the car'.
