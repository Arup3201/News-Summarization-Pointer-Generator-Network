The man accused of beating, strangling and stabbing to death a young Boston woman on her way to the gym attempted suicide right before his court hearing today - by trying to rip out his arteries with his hands.

Edwin J. Alemany pleaded not guilty today to the murder of Amy Lord, 24, whose body was found last month in a thickly-wooded area of Hyde Park in Boston.

She was one of the three young women attacked in the same area in a 24-hour period. Alemany is suspected of carrying out all three and has also been charged with one of the attacks.

Suspect: Edwin Alemany is led from district court in Boston after he was arrested on July 25. He was put on suicide watch in jail

Court appearance: Video surveillance from the day of Amy's death shows someone - 
purportedly Alemany - pacing back and forth in front of Amy's building 
and then forcing her back inside when she came out

Suffolk Assistant District Attorney 
John Pappas told the court that Amy left her Dorchester home at 5.30am 
to take a bus downtown to go to the gym with a friend, The Boston Globe reported.

But she never made it to the gym.

Alemany is accused of beating her inside her home, forcing her into her 
jeep and taking her to five different ATMs to take money out before 
brutally murdering her.

purportedly Alemany - pacing back and forth in front of Amy's building 
and then forcing her back inside when she came out.

After the murder, officials said Alemany spent $400 in cash on a cellphone and paid some
cellphone bills.

His defense attorney Jeffrey Denner 
told the judge today that his client had tried to kill himself by tearing open
arteries with his bare hands, leaving him with self-inflicted scratches
to his neck and arms.

Not guilty pleas to the murder and 
kidnapping charges were entered on Alemany’s behalf and he was ordered to be
held without bail.

In the other incidents, a woman was attacked at Andrew Square at
5am on the same day and a third the next day at 12.10am. They both survived.

Donald Lord, Amy Lord’s grandfather, has 
said he was devastated at the news of her death.

'If you had a daughter, you would want her to be
like Amy,' he told the Boston Herald. 'She was everything you would want to your daughter
to be.'

She worked as a digital media analyst for Genuine Interactive. The company released a statement saying her death was 'both tragic and shocking'.

'We are taking time to focus on the 
well-being of Amy’s family and friends, while trying to come to grips 
with the loss of such a vibrant, caring and special young person who had an infectious positive 
personality, an ever-present smile and caring nature.'

Boston police and Suffolk District 
Attorney Daniel F. Conley’s office are actively investigating the crime.

Scene: The body of Amy Lord, 24, from South Boston, was found in Hyde Park by a man riding a bicycle in the thickly-wooded area

Woods: Hyde Park's Stony Brook Reservation is a popular place for joggers

Leah Cameron, Amy's former 
cheerleading coach at Minnechaug Regional High School in Wilbraham, 
said: 'She was this beautiful angel who came from a small town and went 
to the big city.'

A number of young women could be seen crying and hugging outside her apartment today according to the Boston Globe.

Lord
was a 2011 graduate of Bentley University in Waltham with a bachelor’s 
degree in marketing, quantitative perspectives, the university said in a
statement.

'Our heartfelt sympathies and condolences go out to Amy’s family, friends, classmates and professors.

'We
can only imagine their grief during this tragic time. The Bentley 
community grieves along with so many who knew and loved this ambitious, 
energetic and talented young woman.'
