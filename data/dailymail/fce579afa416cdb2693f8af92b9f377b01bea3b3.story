It seems that more is more when it comes to exposing skin in Hollywood, if last night's Golden Globes red carpet is anything to go by.

The likes of Rosamund Pike, Sienna Miller,  Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jane Fonda and Katie Cassidy all stole the show in revealing cutaway gowns.

The trend is all about showing off just the right amount of flesh - but the A-listers' love to break the style rules.

Kate Hudson championed the cutaway trend at Sunday night's Golden Globes and showed off her toned body  in this Versace gown

While Jane Fonda, Sienna Miller and Kate Hudson trialled the trend with seductive subtlety, some stars had almost every inch of flesh on show.

Jennifer Lopez shunned the 'chest or legs' rule and opted to show off both assets in her plunging Zuhair Murad gown. 

Rosamund Pike made like J-Lo by baring her chest, side and back in an ethereal layered white chiffon Vera Wang gown with daring cut-outs at the waist.

Katie Cassidy also exposed plenty of skin in her silver and black gown, which was slashed to the thigh and bared her stomach and chest. 

Speaking about the trend - and how the stars pulled it off - Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'The cutaway trend is all about showing off the perfect amount of flesh to highlight your best features. 

'If you love your legs, a slashed thigh gown is the perfect option and if you're proud of your stomach, a few subtle slashes at the waist can emphasise a toned tum. It's all about focusing on your body strengths but remaining sophisticated.

'Jane Fonda hit the right notes in Versace, but Katie Cassidy left little to the imagination in her gown.' 

Jennifer Lopez, pictured at last night's awards, has been described as 'the sexiest dresser on any red carpet'

Fashion writer Simon Glazin (theverysimong.com) offered his views, saying: 'Put a cutaway dress on a TOWIE girl and it will undoubtedly look cheap.  But put a designer one on an A-lister, and nine times out of 10 they look amazing.

'Donatella Versace has perfected the ultra glam cutout dress, which Kate Hudson is a huge fan of. This white number is A class.

'Jane Fonda, at 77-years-old, often likes to show off that famous workout-toned body. This red Versace gown is perfect on her.

'Unfortunately Rosamund Pike lost it for me, it just wasn't the right shape on her at all, but I do salute a woman who gave birth five weeks previous to go down a red carpet like this.'

'Unfortunately Rosamund Pike lost it for me, it just wasn't the right shape on her at all, but I do salute a woman who gave birth five weeks previous to go down a red carpet like this,' said fashion writer Simon Glazin

'Emily Blunt and Sienna Miller, two beautiful English roses, showed the more sophisticated side to cutaway dressing. Whilst Jennifer Lopez, the queen of va va voom, is undeniably the sexiest dresser on any red carpet.

'I think if you're feeling daring and confident enough, and you have the right shape body, by all means flash some flesh with expertly placed cutouts.

'It's what Donatella would want.'

Emily Blunt trialled the trend with subtlety at the event and looked classy in her flowing white gown which she accessorised with £1.4 million worth of beautiful jewellery from designer Lorraine Schwartz
