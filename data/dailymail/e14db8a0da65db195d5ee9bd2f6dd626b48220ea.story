Ann Romney cooled off on a Florida beach this weekend as her husband got fired up for the final presidential debate.

As husband Mitt indulged in a beach football game between his staffers and invited reporters, Mrs Romney took advantage of the Florida sunshine in her fetching floral suit, going for a swim with her family at a public beach.

The 63-year-old wife of the Republican presidential candidate looked glamorous in the brightly-colored, halterneck suit with matching sarong on Delray Beach.

She splashed around in the water with her son Craig, his wife Mary and grandchildren, before she grabbed a towel and headed for a hired sun lounger surrounded by other families.

Beach beauty: Ann Romney, 63, looked glamorous in a bright and flattering floral suit on the Florida beach this Sunday

Life's a beach: The mother-of-five (with her son Craig) looked delighted to be going for a dip

Mrs Romney went almost unnoticed as she milled around talking to family at the water's edge although Secret Service were discreetly present.

Hours before they hit the beach, Mitt Romney and wife Ann were pictured attending church in Boca Raton  where she grabbed attention in a scarlet dress with full-length zip and chunky jewellery.

Although he did not attend the family outing, Romney organized a game of flag football between his staffers and pool reporters on Delray beach on Sunday.

The latest poll has Romney neck-and-neck with Obama as they each have 47 per cent of likely voters ahead of their debate this evening.

Monday's face-off represents one of the last major opportunities for Obama and 
Romney to capture the attention of millions of voters - especially that 
small but sought-after group who haven't yet made up their 
minds.

While most women of 63 would be 
hitting the beach in all-obscuring black, or shrouded in a loose 
cover-up, the trim Mrs Romney knows she has nothing to hide.

Proving
women in their sixth decade can have as much fun with swimwear as their
daughters, the white floral-print number is a clever choice that 
flatters the figure without losing out on style.

The punchy print, with its bright flowers, distract from any lumps and bumps beneath, as does the ruching across the midriff.

The
suit, which may actually be a tankini, though it is difficult to tell, 
appears to have some underwire to support the bust. This lends 
structure, helping to make the waist look smaller - and the wearer walk 
taller.

A slim halterneck, too, is always pretty - a thicker strap style would have looked matronly with that print.

And
though Mrs Romney has slim legs that a woman half her age would envy, 
the co-ordinating swim skirt covers her behind, allowing for a more 
modest look befitting her age, while the tie at the side can be adjusted
so as not to cut into the waist.

The President had arrived on Friday to prep for the 
debate, a 90-minute encounter focused on international affairs.

Mrs Romney has given Michelle Obama, noted for her sartorial choices, a run for her money on the campaign trail.

Last
week she attended the annual Al Smith dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in 
New York in a sweeping black and white gown and cape.

At
the second presidential debate in New York, both Mrs Romney and the First Lady 
appeared in bright pink which fashion bloggers noted was in honor of 
breast cancer awareness month.

Mrs Romney has herself battled breast cancer and also spoke this weekend about her struggle with M.S., when she visited a Cuban restaurant in Florida.

Romney was diagnosed in 1998 with the incurable neurological disease, which attacks the central nervous system and immobilizes many of its victims.

Mrs Romney said she was an avid tennis player when she first started noticing her symptoms, which primarily affected her balance and coordination.

'It was really tough on my balance,' she said. 'I couldn't figure out what was going on.

'That was sort of what was happening. I was trying to figure out what was going on, what was wrong with me.'

Master of ceremonies: Mitt Romney, who was at the beach separately from his wife, organized a game of flag football between the pool reporters who cover his campaign and his staffers

Steely-eyed: Mitt and Ann Romney were in Florida over the weekend, attending church on Sunday and preparing for the third and final debate on Monday
