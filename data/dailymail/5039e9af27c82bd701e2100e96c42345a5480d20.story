By the time we reach adulthood, our bodies contain 260 bones -  all working in unison to help us walk, grip, jump and move around. 

And now a designer has captured these complex joints and motions in a set of mesmerising GIFs, created using raw X-ray footage.

The animations reveal how the hand and wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee, foot and ankle work.

The GIFs were created by San Francisco-based designer Cameron Drake for his client Weiss Orthopedics. Mr Drake began by uploading the raw footage to a video editor and trimming the clips so they revealed the precise motions made by the joints. This GIF shows the movement of the hand and wrist

Mr Drake began by uploading the raw footage to a video editor and trimming the clips so they revealed the precise motions made by the joints.

He then removed the individual patient details using Photoshop.

Once the clips were selected, Mr Drake duplicated the frames so they played on a loop.

'This
 was an excitement in and of itself as there is not much like it on the 
web and gave me an opportunity to do something cool,' he wrote on his 
website.

At birth, babies are born with 350 bones which gradually fuse together to complete the adult skeleton of 260. 

Bone is a honeycomb-like grid of calcium salts built around protein fibres called collagen. This image shows the range of the ankle as the foot points down and up. There are almost double the amount of bones in the foot, at 52, compared to the hand, with 27

Elsewhere, the knee joint and movement is captured. It shows the hinge joint moving as the leg, consisting of the femur in the thigh, and the tibia and fibula in the lower leg, extend. This joint is protected by the knee cap, or patella

In one of Mr Drake's images, he captured the movements in the hand and wrist as the patient made a fist.

There are eight small carpal bones in the wrist, bound in two rows of four bones each, while each hand has 27 distinct bones that help give it the wide range of motion.

Another image captures the movement of the elbow, as its hinge joint moves the humerus in the upper arm, and the ulna and the radius in the forearm.

The humerus is then connected to the scapula, or shoulder blade and the clavicle, or collarbone - as seen in the shoulder GIF.

Another image captures the movement of the elbow, (pictured) as its hinge joint moves the humerus in the upper arm, and the ulna and the radius in the forearm

Elsewhere, the knee joint and movement is captured.

It shows the hinge joint moving as the leg, consisting of the femur in the thigh, and the tibia and fibula in the lower leg, extend.

This joint is protected by the knee cap, or patella.

The final image in this collection shows the range of the ankle as the foot points down and up.

There are almost double the amount of bones in the foot, at 52, compared to the hand.
