Nowadays quirky weddings are all the rage, with couples being read their nuptials anywhere from hot-air balloons to under the ocean.

But meet the Glaziers, who 20 years ago were ahead of their time with a bizarre marriage stunt.

In 1991 Sue and Chris Glazier won a radio competition's 'mystery prize', meaning they spent the evening after they tied the knot circling the M25 in a huge bus.

Their odd story has emerged in a BBC documentary about the M25 being screened on its 25th anniversary tomorrow.

Today Mr Glazier, 44, a metal polisher from Lydd, Kent, spoke of their delight after they were picked for the unusual stunt.

'They told us the night before that we would be travelling at 50mph.

'My wife was thinking we were going to be on the Orient Express.'

Instead, after their wedding in Ashford on March 27, 1991, they were driven to the newly opened Thurrock service station for the reception.

Then came their big treat: a bus arrived to take them and their guests around the full 114-mile length of the M25.

Four hours and one complete circuit later, the guests were dropped off - and the happy couple were driven around the orbital twice more.

'There was a massive four-poster bed fitted into the bus, with a TV, video and ice box. It was a bumpy night ... but quiet,' said Mr Glazier.

Eventually the bus pulled back into the service station where the couple enjoyed a hearty fry-up.

Mrs Glazier, 43, a self-employed cleaner, said she was 'shocked' when they found out what lay in store on their wedding night.

But she soon realised she'd be just as happy being Mrs Glazier on a bus as she would in a five-star hotel.

'As long as we were going to be together, that's all that mattered.

'Most people want to see the back of the M25 as quickly as possible. I just hope I'm never stuck on it. I don't want to tarnish the memories.'

The M25 took more than 11 years to 
build at a cost of £1 billion. It was opened by the then prime minister 
Margaret Thatcher to a fanfare on October 29, 1986.

Another £1 billion is now being spent on an expansion that will see the motorway grow to eight lanes wide in parts.

The
documentary, The Road To Nowhere, tells how house prices have gone up 
300-400 per cent since the M25 opened, making huge profits for the 
landowners whose farmland was snapped up by developers.

Its construction saw a big influx of US companies attracted to American-style business parks that sprang up near the route.

The M25 was also the centre of an illegal rave scene that developed shortly after it opened.

'All that everybody knew was these raves would happen somewhere on the periphery of the M25,' said DJ Judge Jules.

You
set off in the direction of the M25 and at a certain point in the 
night, through mobile phone and word of mouth, the location would be 
given away.'

The Road to Nowhere is at 5.10pm tomorrow on BBC1.
