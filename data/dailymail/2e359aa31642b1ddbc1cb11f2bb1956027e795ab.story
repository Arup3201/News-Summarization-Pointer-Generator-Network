It's just a couple of miles from  Shepperton film studios - where movies such as The Third Man, The Omen, Alien and Shakespeare In Love were filmed - and Creek House has played its own part in showbiz history.

The Canadian-born British TV personalities  Bernard Braden and his wife Barbara Kelly once owned the 19th Century, seven-bedroom mansion - which is now on the market for a guide price of £3 million.

Bernard and Barbara were household names in the 1950s and 1960s. Bernard is best remembered for ITV's On The Braden Beat - a precursor to Esther Rantzen's That's Life - in which he showcased his acerbic wit.

Barbara is remembered for regular appearances on the hugely popular BBC Sunday night panel show What's My Line?

In the couple's heyday, House & Garden magazine devoted eight pages to an 'at home' interview with them and their three children. The couple spent nine years at Creek House, in Surrey, where the garden leads down to Millbrook Creek, which flows into the Thames.

In 1959 they sold the house to actor John Gregson and his wife Thea, who lived there with their six children. Gregson starred in 40 films, including Ealing comedies Whisky Galore! and The Lavender Hill Mob. But he is renowned for the Bafta-winning 1953 picture Genevieve, in which he starred alongside Kenneth More. He died aged 55 in 1975.

Earlier, the pub down the road from 
Creek House was a focus of Hollywood gossip, as it was where trysts 
between Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were conducted while Taylor 
was still married to Eddie Fisher.

'The Gregsons held parties here where they played host to stars such as Peter O'Toole, Peter Ustinov and Vivien Leigh,' says current owner Barry Wilkinson, 74. 'We feel very dull in comparison,' says his wife Jane, 67.

While the central part of the house is Georgian in style, there are sprawling Arts and Crafts and Victorian additions that the Wilkinsons believe were added by an early architect owner. These include a stunning room at the top of the house with stained-glass windows and a vaulted ceiling - now Barry's study.

The Wilkinsons bought the house 16 years
ago from a dentist who had bought it from Thea Gregson. She had stayed 
on in the house for several years after John's death.

Thea is still alive and living in the Cotswolds and until recently made twice-yearly pilgrimages to Creek House. A devout Catholic, she built a small - and unconsecrated - chapel  in the grounds which still stands today on the acre of land across the creek which is included in the house sale.

When the Wilkinsons bought it for £650,000, they had a teenage son and daughter and the house was in need of a lot of work.

'We were living in Woking and had no intention of moving, but a property magazine  came through the letterbox and we couldn't resist coming to have a look,' says Jane,  who used to run her own human resources consultancy. Three days later they had put  in an offer, despite their home not being on the market.

The couple spent £250,000 rewiring, installing a new roof, ripping out the dated bathrooms and moving the kitchen from a small anteroom to the middle of the house, where it now looks over the garden down to the creek. They kept one part of the house as a self-contained cottage, which they now let out.

The couple retained original features, such as the stunning oak panels in the drawing room, and replaced some of the broken sash windows and doors. They uncovered original fireplaces, which had been painted or boarded over, and restored some stained-glass windows. They had the garden redesigned and landscaped and renovated stone balustrades on the patio.

'I love to restore things - it was a labour of love,' says Barry, a former accountant who retired a year into the three-year project. We hired a builder to do the work for us but I was his apprentice and learnt a lot from him.'

According to estate agent Russell Gooden of Jackson-Stops & Staff, Creek House is so unique that there is little to compare it to in the vicinity, although he explains it's not uncommon to pay a 35 to 40 per cent premium for a waterside property in Shepperton.

He says prices in the area have been pushed up because of a lack of stock, adding: 'Traditionally, the beginning of the year is a time  to sell, but we haven't seen the usual influx. Mortgages are a little more difficult to get so perhaps people who want to move are unable to do so and a lot of people are still sitting on the fence.'

Barry and Jane are now downsizing and plan to buy something smaller in the area. 'We feel very rooted here,' says Jane. 'Shepperton is very villagey and has a great sense of community. People tend to stay a long time.'

Who do they expect to buy the house next? 'I've got an image of a young family who would really enjoy being at Creek House,' adds Jane.
