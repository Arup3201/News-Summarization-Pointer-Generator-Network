With its stone walls, picket gate and stunning views of the surrounding countryside, it seemed the perfect rural home.

But this 200-year-old cottage opposite a village church concealed a sinister secret – an illegal drugs factory.

In a underground bunker dug beneath the house’s patio decking, a gang was growing cannabis, processing cocaine and dealing in guns.

This pretty cottage in Kilmersdon, Somerset, turned out to have a drugs bunker hidden under garden decking

Pretty setting: The gang had dug out the 50ft garden of the £350,000 cottage, which was rented by one of their members, and hid the entrance under patio decking

After a complex police investigation 11 men were jailed for a total of 70 years as for conspiracy to supply drugs and firearms.

Yesterday neighbours said they had no idea the £350,000 cottage, in Kilmersdon, Somerset, was being used for crime.

Percival Fowler, 91, said: ‘People 
were always coming and going and they used to have meetings, but we had 
no idea why. The house was always very busy, quite often there were 
people in there and quite a lot of them went down into the garden.

‘I never suspected it was a drugs 
bunker … They kept themselves to themselves. It was all happening under 
our noses and we failed to spot it – they were very secretive.’

He added: ‘It’s quite a small village so it came as a bit of a shock really when we saw the police cars.’
Detectives discovered the bunker in January 2011 following a surveillance operation involving drug suspect Mike Gorham.

When they raided the home they found 
the 55-year-old hiding in the makeshift underground room with the gang’s
ringleader, Steve Tamblyn, 29.

Police uncovered 76 cannabis plants 
worth £33,000, a small amount of cocaine and a hydraulic press used to 
process the class A substance.

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was shocking, to say the least.
‘I was in the church helping to set something up and when I came out there was a police van outside the house.’

Geoffrey Goold, left, and Ben Taylor, right, were jailed for three and four years respectively for the racket

Alan Pinner, 40, left, was jailed for three years and Scott Heal, 28, right, for two-and-a-half years

The gang was later found to be 
supplying firearms, and a raid on another property revealed five guns 
with live ammunition and bullet-making equipment.

Ross Rawlins, of Bristol, was jailed for 26 months

Eleven members of the gang were 
jailed at Bristol Crown Court on July 19, for what Judge Julian Lambert 
described as ‘very serious offences’.

Sentences ranged from 26  months to four-and-a-half years for Gorham and 15 years for ringleader Tamblyn.

Detective Inspector Tina Robinson 
said: ‘Illegal drugs and firearms have no place in our communities and 
this case should go to show that we will continue to target and bring 
organised criminals to justice.

These men were part of a 
sophisticated conspiracy and some managed to hide their crime from both 
their employers and  family for some time.

‘However they were not successful in evading us.

‘The sentences given today reflect 
the severity of their crime and I hope they will deter others from 
getting involved in the supply of Class A drugs and deadly weapons.’

The cottage is part of Lord Hylton’s estates, but is owned and run by a charitable housing association.

The quaint village of Kilmersdon is home to just 550 residents and is known as the birthplace of nursery rhyme Jack and Jill.

Eleven men have been jailed for their roles in a conspiracy to supply cannabis, cocaine and firearms from a bunker hidden under the garden. The bunker's entrance was discovered when police followed a suspect to the cottage

Police found 76 cannabis plants growing in the bunker, thought to have a street value of £33,000
