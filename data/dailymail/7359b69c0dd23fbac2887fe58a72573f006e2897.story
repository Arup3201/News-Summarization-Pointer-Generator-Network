A man has been charged after running onto the pitch during West Ham’s game with Tottenham and taking a free-kick.

Jordan Matthew Dunn, of Dover in Kent, has been charged under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states that it is an offence to enter the playing area without lawful authority.

Mr Dunn sprinted across the Upton Park pitch before shooting towards the Hammers’ goal as Christian Eriksen prepared to take a free-kick. His effort was saved by Spanish goalkeeper Adrian.

After originally avoiding stewards who ran on to chase him, Mr Dunn was apprehended by secrity staff before being taken to a police station in east London.

He missed Tottenham’s winning goal, which arrived through summer signing Eric Dier in the 90th minute as Spurs secured a 1-0 win on the opening day of the new Premier League season.

The 22-year-old will appear at Thames Magistrates’ court on September 1.
