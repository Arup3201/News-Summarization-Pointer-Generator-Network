He may be a future king but he’s certainly not as glamorous as his wife – and yesterday Prince William clearly felt the need to apologise.

The Duke of Cambridge said sorry not once but twice for his presence on a two-day tour of Malta that was supposed to be Kate’s first independent overseas visit.

Prince William told his hosts that his 32-year-old wife was feeling ‘so-so’ after suffering acute morning sickness and added: ‘She’s very disappointed she couldn’t be here… Unfortunately you have me.’

Later, as he visited Prime Minister Dr Joseph Muscat at the Auberge de Castille he added: ‘I’m sorry you’ve got me instead of Catherine.’

Royal sources say the Duchess, who was due to deliver a message from the Queen to the people of Malta, was ‘absolutely desperate’ to make the trip but her medics advised against her travelling.

She is believed to be resting at home at Kensington Palace with Prince George and his nanny.

The Duke also joked it would be some time before he would bring the couple’s rumbustious 14-month-old son to the country.

When the president said she would love to see Prince George and the new baby in Malta one day, William laughed: ‘Malta might not survive Prince George. There’s too many precious things around here.’

The Duke, who was celebrating 50 years of Maltese independence, said in a speech: ‘Catherine has asked me to say how very sorry she is that she couldn’t be the one to pass on the Queen’s greetings to you all.

‘She was looking forward to coming here enormously.’

Officials involved in planning the trip say every effort was made for the Duchess to attend and that requirements for an ambulance to be on standby throughout, as well as access to facilities and a chair at all times, had been accommodated.

The highlight of the visit was a fireworks display at Malta’s Grand Harbour last night where William delivered a message from the Queen: ‘Prince Philip and I send our congratulations to the President, the Prime Minister, and the people of Malta, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Independence.

‘Prince Philip and I are grateful to the people of Malta for always making us, and our family, feel so welcome. I send my warmest good wishes to you for your celebrations this week, and for the continued success and prosperity of Malta in the future.’

The Queen lived in Malta for two years after marrying Prince Philip while he served on HMS Chequers in the Royal Navy’s Mediterranean Fleet and considers it one of the happiest times of her life.
