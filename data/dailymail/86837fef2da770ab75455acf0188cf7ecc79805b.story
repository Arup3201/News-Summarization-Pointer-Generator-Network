Abused: Leisha Brookes claims Jimmy Savile and other men attacked at the BBC TV 's White City HQ

A woman has vowed to go to jail rather than pay her TV licence because she claimed she was abused by Jimmy Savile and 35 other men at the BBC's headquarters.

Magistrates listened in shocked silence as 45-year-old Leisha Brookes explained why she would not pay the £145.50 fee.

She said: 'No matter what you fine me , I am not going to give a penny to my abusers from the BBC. I cannot pay the BBC or anyone connected with it.'

The repeated abuse by the disgraced DJ and the men, happened over two years at the BBC TV headquarters in White City, west London, when she was about nine years old, she claimed.

Speaking to the Sunday Express Miss Brookes revealed how she was abused after a cameraman friend of her family introduced her to the former Jim'll Fix It presenter.

He allegedly abused her at his home, taking naked pictures of her when she spent weekends with him after tricking her family into letting her stay.

The cameraman took her repeatedly to visit his workplace as a 'treat' so she could meet the stars of the day and see where programmes were made.

She told the paper: ' At the time Jim’ll Fix It was massive
and I told him I wanted to be on the show. He said, ‘I can do even 
better than that. I can get you to meet Jimmy Savile any time you want’.

Disgraced: Jimmy Savile abused Leisha Brookes when she was nine-year-old, she claims

'I can remember him taking me to see Savile in a room with a table, a 
mirror, a wardrobe and a couple of chairs. The cameraman called him 
Uncle Jim.

'Savile sat in 
this high-backed chair and he asked me to sit on his knee while he 
signed my luminous pink autograph book. I was wearing a pink dress with 
my hair in pigtails. He sat me right back on his body'

Miss Brookes, from Southend, Essex, claimed she was then 
abused and the cameraman took her to see the paedophile another two or three times 
and left them together.

From that moment, she said, almost every week she was left alone with men at the White City studios.

Victim: Leisha Brooks says the abuse wrecked her life and gave her mental problems

She produced documents for the magistrates at Colchester proving that she had given evidence to police as part of Operation Yewtree investigation into Savile and other suspected paedophiles

Waiving her right to ­anonymity, Miss Brookes said the abuse had wrecked her life, leading to mental health problems and suicide attempts. Eventually her five children were put into care.

She had been fined three times by courts over the past seven years for failing to have a TV licence, previously blaming 'personal reasons' for her refusal to pay.

She was found guilty and fined £50 with a surcharge of £20, giving her 28 days to pay.

The BBC said: 'Operation Yewtree is a police matter and it is not something we can comment on.'
