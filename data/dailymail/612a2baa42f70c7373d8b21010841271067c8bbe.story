A mystery woman was on the bridge alongside cowardly captain Francesco Schettino when his ship ran aground off an Italian island on Friday night, it emerged today.

The blonde woman is a 25-year-old Moldovan crew member who was not properly identified by investigators as she reportedly did not appear on any official manifest for the Costa Concordia.

She is passenger rep Domnica Cemortan, possibly hired without a proper contract. Reports speculated she may have been on the bridge because Schettino was trying to impress her.

Mystery: Moldovan Domnica Cemortan, 25, was on the bridge with Schettino when the Costa Concordia crashed

The Moldovan dancer admitted she was Captain Francesco Schettino's lover and boarded the Costa Concordia without a ticket

Prosecutor Francesco Verusio had asked police to try and trace the woman, pictured on the doomed Concordia just before it left Civitavecchia harbour on the evening it ran aground.

She is swiftly emerging as a key witness to the chain of events up until the liner struck an underwater reef just off the island of Giglio.

Witnesses have said that she appeared to know Schettino.

But a statement from Costa Cruises later confirmed Ms Cemortan was an authorised passenger.

It said: 'Costa Cruises would like to clarify that the law as it stands, safety regulations and the control systems applied meticulously by the company do not permit the embarkation of unregistered passengers.

'Based on the pictures broadcast by the media, the woman stated as being in the company of Captain Schettino on the evening of January 13th was certainly embarked on January 13th in Civitavecchia and duly registered.

'The company is ready to provide the authorities, when requested, with the identity of the person and the number of the ticket purchased.'

Investigators want to find out where she was at the moment the Concordia hit the rocks.

There is also the possibility she would have key evidence on what happened in the moments after the fatal 'sail by' which was apparently carried out by Schettino as a 'salute' to a former captain.

It is believed that Miss Cemortan, from Chisnau, Moldova, was working as a passenger rep for Costa Cruises and gave a brief interview to the media defending Schettino, adding that his actions had helped save the lives of holidaymakers and crew.

She has also said in an interview on Moldovan TV that she did have dinner with the captain, but that she went to the bridge after the impact to give instructions to Russian speaking passengers.

Rescue: Firefighters climb up a ladder on to the Costa Concordia as it lies on its side off the island of Giglio, Tuscany

Race against time: A technician aims a laser scanner at the cruise liner. There are fears impending bad weather could cause the ship to fall off the ledge on which it is resting

Italian newspapers suggested that she
 was the blonde woman seen dining with Schettino at around 9pm - just 
under 30 minutes before the disaster - but there is also the possibility
 she may have been the guest of another officer on the liner.

Last
 night in a bizarre twist a male passenger had to be taken off the 
Concordia's sister ship Serena after suffering a heart attack as the 
liner sailed past Giglio at the start of a seven-day cruise.

Searching
 has resumed on the stricken vessel with divers focusing primarily on 
the stern by the deck four restaurant muster station, where the majority
 of the 21 people still listed as missing were thought to be.

The area is where seven of the bodies recovered so far have been found.

Operation: Italian divers will use explosives to get into the hull of the Costa Concordia

Impact: A satellite image shows the stricken cruise liner on its side in shallow water

The operation is now focusing on retrieving the remaining bodies before the weather worsens.

Diving
 teams will use explosive charges to get into the superstructure of the 
Concordia's hull so that they can reach areas of the liner more quickly 
as there are fears the ship could topple over the rock ledge on which it
 is resting.

Searches 
have been called off twice after movement was detected - if the 
Concordia does slip it will plunge almost 100m to the bottom of the 
Mediterranean. They were given up to 24 hours to complete their search this morning as predictions of rough seas were made for later today.

Eleven people died and 21 are still missing after the Costa Concordia hit a submerged reef off the island of Giglio on Friday night.

It comes after a member of the crew on board the cruise liner told the Italian coastguard the vessel had only suffered a power outage and there was no emergency, according to a new recording.

News channel Sky TG 24, which broadcast the tape, said it was the first radio conversation between the coastguard and the ship after it hit a rock off Tuscany's coast on Friday night.

The conversation began at 21:12GMT - around 30 minutes after the accident.

By then, many passengers had called relatives on their cell phones asking them to alert the police, who in turn told the coastguard to check on the state of the ship.

Despair: Relatives and friends of victims of the cruise liner disaster arrive at Giglio Porto

'Good evening Costa Concordia, please, do you have problems on board?', a coastguard official asks the bridge.

An unidentified member of the crew replies: 'We've had a blackout, we are checking the conditions on board.'

The coastguard asks: 'What kind of a problem? Is it just something with 
the generator? The police ... have received a phone call from the 
relatives of a sailor who said that during the dinner everything was 
falling on his head.'

He says some passengers were already wearing life jackets.          

The crew member simply repeats that there has been a blackout. 'We are 
checking the conditions on boar,' he says, promising to keep the 
coastguard informed.    

Search: 21 people are still unaccounted for with time running out for the divers searching the cruise liner

Vigil: Family and friends of Jerry and Barbara Heil, the only Americans still unaccounted for on the Costa Concordia, attend a prayer service in White Bear Lake, Minnesota

Eleven people were killed in the accident and 24 are still unaccounted 
for, although some of the dead have yet to be identified.  

The captain of the ship, Francesco Schettino, is under house arrest and 
has been accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and 
abandoning ship. 

In another leaked recording released this week, the Italian coastguards 
are heard angrily pleading with Schettino and telling him to return to 
his listing ship.      

The ship operators have blamed him for the disaster and praised the rest of the crew for their efforts to save lives. 

Passengers have complained that they were left for hours waiting in 
lifeboats, stairwells and assembly points before the order to evacuate 
was issued.            

By the end of the week the salvage operation is expected to begin on the 2,200 tonnes of heavy-duty diesel in the Concordia's tanks which could cause an environmental disaster if it leaks.

Once the go-ahead is given for the pumping to begin - and a huge salvage barge is already at the dock in Giglio - it will take as long as a month to remove all the fuel.
