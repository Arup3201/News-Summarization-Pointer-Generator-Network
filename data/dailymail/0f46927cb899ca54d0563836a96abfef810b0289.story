The couple will also discuss issues of mutual interest, such as health care, welfare and gender equality, the ministry said. 

The 37-year-old looked casually chic in smart black suit trousers, a pussy-bow collared blouse, black jumper and blazer. 

She carried a large white tote and wore her brunette hair in its signature bouncy blow dry as she made her way through the airport with a smile on her face. 

Unfortunately for the sophisticated royal, she revealed more than she bargained for, as her white bra was hard to miss under her black jumper.

It seemed that the fresh-faced brunette, who wore barely an inch of make-up, was greeted in style with a royal welcome as she landed.

The Swedish royal hasn't been seen out and about since Victoria Day earlier this month.

The brunette royal was joined by her daughter, Princess Estelle, to celebrate the event in Stockholm at the city's Royal Palace. 

The mother-of-one, who is the eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, said her namesake day was 'fantastic' and that she was in good company with her daughter. 

The mother daughter duo enjoyed the sounds of  Princess Victoria's festive march, which was performed by the Army Band and first played on the Crown Princess's 18th birthday. 

Princess Victoria and Estelle also enjoyed a day out at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championship together this month.
