Devastated: Xiaoliang Qin, 31, said he would not be able to visit home after losing most of his money

A Chinese worker who dropped his entire annual salary at a road crossing on a windy day watched in horror as passers-by scooped up his cash.

Xiaoliang Qin, 31, a migrant worker from the impoverished Anhui province, had withdrawn his year's cash at a Shanghai bank and planned to spend it on a trip back home.

But while crossing a busy intersection, the courier dropped the bag containing 18,000 yuan (£1,800), sending 100-yuan notes blowing across the street.

Motorists and pedestrians grabbed handfuls of notes as Mr Qin screamed at them that it was all he had.

A passer-by was hit by a car and injured his leg in the chaos.

'I was there shouting, "Don't pick it up! It is my whole year's salary! I need it for the New Year!",' said Mr Qin, according to a report in China Daily.

The only people who handed any money back were three sanitation workers, Mr Qin told the Shanghai Morning Post, leaving him with just 3,700 yuan (£377).

He called the police, who arrived to find the courier crying on his knees at the intersection.

'I cannot celebrate New Year without my money,' he said afterwards. 'You people who own cars, how can you stop and take my money?'

Shanghai police contacted two car owners seen on CCTV picking up money to tell them to return it.

He had intended to travel home with his 83-year-old father, a street cleaner, by night bus.

But happily for Mr Qin, his plight invoked the generosity of more than 300 users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter, who offered to help fund his trip home for the Spring 
Festival, according to Shanghai TV.

The migrant worker has now recovered around 7,800 yuan (£796).
