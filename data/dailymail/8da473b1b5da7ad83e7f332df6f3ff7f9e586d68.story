A Muslim girls’ state school which recruits only female staff has been criticised by Ofsted inspectors for a lack of male influence on pupils.

Feversham College in Bradford has been told to introduce male role models to its ‘all-female environment’.

The 664-pupil school was visited by inspectors last month as Ofsted’s ‘Trojan Horse’ probe into attempts to impose a strict religious agenda on schools was extended beyond Birmingham.

The watchdog found that music was not taught as a separate subject to 11 to 14-year-olds and some teachers were given performance targets to develop the school’s ‘Islamic ethos’.

Inspectors also reported that the school operated an ‘all-female learning environment’ which extended to male governors ‘not interact[ing] with students’.

Ofsted urged the school to ‘increase opportunities for the broadest range of positive role models, including men and male governors, to be part of students’ learning’.

The college was also told to ‘continue to review the breadth and balance of the curriculum’, although it currently met legal requirements.

The school’s recruitment policies are already being investigated by the Department for Education amid concerns they may be unlawful.

DfE officials intervened earlier this year after the school ran job adverts specifying women teaching staff.

Now the department’s Education Funding Agency (EFA) says it is ‘working with’ the college to ensure recruitment procedures are ‘fully compliant’ with equality law.

Feversham – motto ‘In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful’ – aims to educate girls aged 11 to 18 ‘in the context of the Islamic Sunni faith as a way of life’.

The designated faith school was judged ‘outstanding’ at its last full Ofsted inspection and is regularly among the highest-performing state comprehensives in the country.

Ofsted 
placed five schools in Birmingham special measures earlier this month 
after investigating allegations of a concerted attempt to introduce a 
strict Islamic agenda in state schools.

It
 uncovered an ’organised campaign’ to impose a ‘narrow faith-based 
ideology’ on schools which was resulting in pupils being poorly prepared
 for life in modern Britain.

The watchdog made a snap inspection at Feversham last month because the ‘chief inspector was concerned about the effectiveness of safeguarding and leadership and management at the academy’.

In their report, inspectors praised many aspects of the school – which became an academy with extra freedoms in 2011 - and noted that students were ‘prepared for life in modern Britain’.

The school is ‘aware of the risk of extremism and radicalisation’ and implements the Government’s ‘Prevent’ strategy aimed at combating it, the report said.

‘An annual “health check” by the local counter-terrorism unit ensures the academy is following best practice,’ it added.

The report said music was not taught as a separate subject to younger pupils but noted that pupils were exposed to music in classes such as drama and allowed to stage performances.

It added: ‘Some teachers’ targets are linked to the development of the academy’ s Islamic ethos but these are in the minority’.

The report said governors ‘express a range of different views on the rationale for the retention of an all-female learning environment’.

It added: ‘Male governors are not role models within the academy because they do not interact with students in this all-female environment.’

Ofsted warned that if the school’s recruitment policy is found not to comply with Government requirements, future Ofsted ratings for the head and governors could be affected.

The school’s two ‘priorities for further improvement’ were to increase pupils’ exposure to male role models and ensure the curriculum ‘continues to extend students’ range of experience’.

Defending its job adverts specifying women staff, the school’s head, Clare Skelding, said earlier this year the policy had been accepted by the Government when the school – previously a private school - entered the state education system.

‘Feversham College was established in 1984 for 11 to 18-year-old Muslim girls, in response to parental demand for single-sex education based on religious beliefs’ she said.

‘When applying for voluntary-aided status in 2001, it was made very clear to the DfE (DfEE as was) and the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (LEA) that the school’s intention was to continue to operate with female-only staff, based upon two legal opinions obtained at the time by the school.

‘This position was accepted by the DfEE and LEA at the time. The school has recently taken further legal advice from a leading QC, who has confirmed that the school’s policy of a female-only teaching environment is not unlawful and complies with the terms of the Equality Act 2010.’

But Pavan Dhaliwal, of the British Humanist Association, claimed the school’s actions were ‘plainly unlawful’.

The outcome of the Department for Education investigation could have implications for other Muslim faith schools employing single-sex staff.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘All schools must comply with equality law.

‘The Education Funding Agency is working with Feversham College to make sure their recruitment processes are fully compliant.’
