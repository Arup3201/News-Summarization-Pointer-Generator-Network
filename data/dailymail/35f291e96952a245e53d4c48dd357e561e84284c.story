Trial: Alleged blackmailer Desmond Fraser, 31, arriving at Winchester Crown Court this week

A celebrity who has received several death threats and demands for money was 'genuinely fearful' when an alleged blackmailer threatened to reveal 'extremely embarrassing' information, a court heard today.

The star, identified only as T, said he reported concerns to police so often that they would have built up a 'massive file'.

But he said the alleged threat by 31-year-old security worker Desmond Fraser, from Wallasey, Merseyside, gave him a 'mini heart attack'.

The star, whose identity is protected by a court order, told Winchester Crown Court: 'I have had death threats, I have had all sorts of threats.

'I have had similar things happen with people saying they are going to do things like this in the past... The police will have a massive file'.

'I panicked and went to ground... It gave me a mini heart attack and I felt like I was drowning.

'I did not know what to do. I sought advice and was told to wait until the person played their hand.

'I wanted to know more and see what his hand was. I genuinely believed this information would destroy me.

'This person was absolutely threatening me - beyond a shadow of a doubt... It was like waving a gun around. These are genuine fears and concerns.

'I’m genuinely fearful of the ramifications of what could happen here.'

T previously said he was 'petrified' the 'deeply personal' details would be made public and said he was filled with 'fear' and 'panic' when he learned of Fraser’s alleged intentions.

The celebrity added: 'At first I thought it could be a wind-up but it caused me some alarm.

'I
 get people threatening me and saying silly things all the time but 
there was detail there (on this occasion) and I thought there could be 
something in it.'

A court order bans the press from identifying the victim or the details of the alleged demands.

Prosecutor Mary Aspinall-Miles told the court: 'It is material a blackmailer could only dream of.'

Orders such as the one made in this case also include comments made on social media, such as Twitter and Facebook.

Those breaching the conditions can be prosecuted for contempt of court.

Winchester Crown Court heard the information was 'material a blackmailer could only dream of'

The order, issued by Judge Susan Evans
 QC, said: 'Nothing is to be published identifying the victim of the 
charge or the details of the demand of money with menaces.

'No person or persons are to publish those details by any means whatsoever, including publishing between individuals.'

A separate order grants anonymity to a number of the alleged victim’s associates.

It is common for judges to grant anonymity to alleged blackmail victims, in order to encourage them to come forward to police.

Fraser denies one charge of blackmail.

The trial continues.
