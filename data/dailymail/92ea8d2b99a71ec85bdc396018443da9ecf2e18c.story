Team Nigella have refuted Charles Saatchi's damning claims that the pair betrayed Nigella's cancer-stricken first husband John Diamond by starting their relationship while he was still alive.

However sources close to the TV chef have spoken out saying Nigella acted all along with John’s full support and blessing.

'When he knew he didn't have long left, he gave his tacit approval to Saatchi,' John's close friend tells the Sunday People.

'John himself sanctioned the relationship when he knew he was going to die. He was very keen on his young children having a father figure so actively encouraged Nigella to sate Saatchi.'

Meanwhile Nigella's friends reject Saatchi's claim that their relationship was sexual before John's passing.

Saatchi said on Friday: 'Nigella and I began our relationship 
during the last six months of her husband John Diamond's life, rather 
than after his death as she [Nigella] stated in court,' in what he described as 'clarification' in a statement that he volunteered to the Daily Mail.

'Looking back at that time, I very deeply regret that this 
betrayal of John occurred.'

The timing of this 'confession' infuriated Nigella's friends, who described it as a 'wicked attempt to 
smear her'.

They married in 2003, two years after the death from cancer of Nigella's journalist husband and Saatchi's Scrabble-playing friend, John Diamond.

These new claims from Saatchi are barbed and potentially damaging to Nigella, and all are rebutted by her team.

One says: 'Saatchi has been doing his worst for months to damage Nigella because he can't bear it that she walked out on him. Nobody walks out on Saatchi, do they? Why can't he just get on with his life and let her get on with hers?'

Nigella testified in court that the relationship began after her husband's death. Saatchi and Diamond had met over gambling games of Scrabble above a restaurant in Knightsbridge and eventually the journalist brought Saatchi home to meet his wife.

At the time Saatchi was still married to his second wife Kay, mother of his only child Phoebe, 19.

One of Nigella's circle said Saatchi became a frequent visitor when Diamond was ill for four years - and that Nigella and Saatchi had got close by the time Diamond died. But they added that it was 'disgraceful' of Saatchi to say what he has.

This took the form of allegations 
involving, among other things, Nigella’s drug taking and the 
ultra-delicate matter of when their relationship started — they married 
in 2003, two years after the death from cancer of Nigella’s journalist 
husband and Saatchi’s Scrabble-playing friend, John Diamond.

Such is Saatchi’s apparent 
determination to harm his third ex-wife that, astonishingly, he is 
unconcerned that some of what he says contradicts the evidence he gave 
in court during the Grillo sisters’ trial.

For
 example, at Isleworth Crown Court on November 29, he testified: ‘I have
 never, never seen any evidence of Nigella taking any drugs whatsoever. I
 want to be helpful, but I genuinely have no real knowledge at all.’

In
 response to one question, he said: ‘Are you asking me whether I think 
Nigella truly was off her head? Not for a second. Over this whole period
 she was writing books very successfully and appearing on television 
shows very successfully.’

Now
 he says: ‘The truth is that she was taking illegal drugs secretly 
throughout the last few years of our marriage, often with her own child 
when she was far too young to even smoke or drink.’

Drug-taking,
 he goes on, ‘took place at an alarmingly frequent rate. That this 
practice seems to be considered acceptable behaviour in sections of the 
Press is deeply disturbing, as is the notion that you can teach your 
children that drugs are a justifiable way to make “an unbearable 
situation bearable”.’

This 
is a reference to Nigella’s evidence in which she said there had been a 
point in her life with Saatchi when she used cannabis ‘to deal with a 
summer of abuse’. In court Nigella admitted smoking cannabis in front of
 the children. Asked if she smoked ‘with or in front of the children she
 replied: ‘I’m afraid I did.’ She said she took cocaine on six occasions
 to help with the stress of coping with her late husband’s terminal 
cancer, and when subject to moments of Saatchi’s ‘intimate terrorism’ — a
 phrase with special resonance for Saatchi, as we shall see.

Allegations: Saatchi has told the Mail Nigella 'took illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage, often with her own child'

So why is he stirring things up now, when he and Nigella are divorced, living new, separate lives, and the Grillo prosecution has been resolved?

After all, most men aged 70, especially one who is successful and worth around £135 million, would be happy to see the back of an unsavoury episode which exposed the seediness at the heart of his opulent lifestyle.

From a family point of view, it is 
impossible to exaggerate the pain and unhappiness which this continued 
state of war between him and Nigella is generating. Their children are 
the most obvious victims of the collateral damage.

Last
 August, Phoebe was put on the telephone by her father so she could read
 an emotional statement to the Mail, expressing her misery at having no 
contact with Nigella who had been her virtual mother since she was 
seven.

Sources close to the 
family say that Nigella and Phoebe did have some contact after the 
parting, but sadly that has stopped and a present sent for Phoebe’s 
birthday was politely returned.

On
 both sides, friends agree on one other point: what a sad situation it 
is for this degrading soap opera to come between three youngsters who 
grew up happily together from an early age.

Saatchi
 seemingly wants vengeance, though he doesn’t use the word. He claims he
 has ‘no alternative’ to say what he’s saying because of the ‘inaccurate
 allegations’ which Nigella ‘made up about me’ during last month’s court
 hearing and in the media.

‘I no longer feel the need to cover up for her any more,’ he says.

According
 to friends, he is furious with Nigella for linking her drug-taking with
 that vague but devastating phrase ‘intimate terrorism’, implying that 
somehow it was his behaviour that drove her to drugs.

He told a friend: ‘She’s saying  it was my fault she did drugs.  It wasn’t.’

The
 friend adds: ‘He’s angry that he went into court first and spoke up for
 her, but when it was her turn to give evidence she gave him  a 
monstering.

‘Charlie also cannot forgive Nigella for not speaking out on his behalf over the choking business. She let him hang.’

Astonishingly, there are now no fewer than five offered explanations for the lunchtime episode at Scott’s restaurant.

Explanation 1: When given a police caution for his action, Saatchi described the incident as nothing more than ‘a playful tiff’.

Explanation
 2: He told the Grillo court: ‘I was not gripping, strangling or 
throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus. 
Can we be clear? Was it about her drugs use? No.’

Explanation
 3: Nigella, who had remained silent about the episode for five months —
 infuriating Saatchi — until stepping into the witness box at the Grillo
 trial, told the court that she had spotted a child in a pram and made a
 comment about her excitement at the prospect of being a grandmother, at
 which he grabbed her throat saying: ‘I’m the only person you should be 
concerned with.’

Explanation
 4: Some of the pictures showed Saatchi looking in her nose, ostensibly 
for cocaine. Nigella told the court: ‘This was a story he (Saatchi) made
 up afterwards because I would not go back and clear his name.’

Explanation
 5: The row was over whether Nigella’s daughter should go to university —
 Saatchi believed Mimi should go to university.

Anger: According to friends, Saatchi - pictured with Nigella in happier times - is furious with his ex-wife for implying  his behaviour drove her to drugs

How the two must now wish the Grillo 
sisters had never been prosecuted for fraud over their spending of 
nearly £700,000 on a Saatchi private company credit card. Acquitted by a
 jury, they promptly sold their story to a red-top newspaper.

For
 Saatchi and Nigella, the trial meant almost endless exposure and 
embarrassment as their lives were laid bare in excruciating detail. So 
whose idea was it to call in the police?

According
 to Saatchi it was Nigella’s decision, not his, to prosecute the Italian
 sisters who worked for her for more than a decade. ‘Had it been my 
choice there would have been no trial,’ he declares.

‘There
 was no way for me to recoup the money they had spent, or the legal 
bills and the many weeks required to quantify the damage and build the 
case.’

Nigella’s supporters point out that this claim directly contradicts his statement to the police in  January last year — it was read out in court — in which he says that ‘in light of [the Grillos’] behaviour  it would be better to instigate  proceedings against them’.

On July 23, after talking to his accountant, Saatchi was quoted as saying: ‘I then decided that matters had reached a point where there was no alternative but to report the matter to the police.’

Saatchi decided to release his latest fusillade against Nigella  after she appeared on Good  Morning America, seen as her  first step towards regaining the public’s affection.

Having declared war on her, Charles Saatchi is clearly refusing to end hostilities. Most people think it is a war he cannot win.
