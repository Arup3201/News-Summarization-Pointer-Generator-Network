'Night of terror': Manhattan socialite Anne Bass was held for 12 hours in the 2007 ransom attempt at her country retreat in Connecticut

Anne Bass’s boyfriend told a court how he thought he would die when three men ‘dressed like ninjas’ broke into the philanthropist's mansion and 'poisoned' the power couple.

Julian Lethbridge testified in court on the first day of the trial of Bass’s ex-butler, Emanuel Nicolescu, who is accused of holding the pair hostage for 12 hours in her Connecticut estate and injecting them with a 'deadly virus'.

Lethbridge, an artist, described the events of April 15 2007 to the jury.

‘It felt like a flu shot,’ he said. ‘They injected me by sterilizing my shoulder, exactly like an inoculation…I thought it was poisonous or they were putting me to sleep.

‘I couldn’t reconcile the fact that if I was being killed, why would they disinfect the injection site?

‘Then I heard the preparation and the same thing going on with Anne.’

Wielding a knife, one of the assailants announced that they had been injected with a ‘very virulent virus’ with symptoms taking 20-24 hours to appear.

‘When the symptoms appear, it’s almost certain to be fatal’ Lethbridge recalled the thugs saying. 

Masked assailants demanded that the philanthropist pay $8.5 million for an antidote within 20 hours.

‘I thought we were just going to die’ Lethbridge told the court.

It was then, convinced they were both within hours of death, that Leftbridge told his girlfriend, ‘I love you, Anne’, according to prosecutor Paul McConnell.

Authorities say Nicolescu and at least
two other men broke into the house around 11 p.m. on 
the estate spanning several hundred acres in the western Connecticut 
town of Kent. The 69-year-old Bass, former wife of Texas billionaire Sid
Bass, also has homes in New York and Fort Worth, Texas.

Prosecutors told the court that Bass 
had just taken a bath and Lethbridge was falling asleep when he heard ‘a
loud crashing noise and a sound like boots running up steps.’

The break-in happened while Bass’ 3-year-old grandson, Jasper, was sleeping in another room.

Bass tried to bar the invaders from getting in through the kitchen door but they succeeded in forcing their way in.

They then blindfolded the victims, bound their hands with zip ties and took them to a bathroom where they administered the 'poison.'

He told the 
men Bass did not keep that sum of money in the house and that she would 
have to contact associates out of state to get the money. At one point, 
the assailants considered transporting one or both of the victims to New
York, according to an arrest affidavit.

Prosecutors said that Nicolescu, his former roomate Nicolae Helerea, aka Michael Kennedy, and Stefan Barabas talked on either cellphones or two-way radios.

After
about five hours in the house, the men became concerned with the 
presence of the child, the health of the victims and their apparent 
inability to immediately obtain the money, the affidavit says. Before 
fleeing, the men gave the victims a beverage that they claimed was the 
antidote and the victims fell asleep.

Bass and her guest were later treated at a hospital.

Nicolescu
had been in charge of the estate's household staff and provided housing
on the property, but his employment was terminated months before the 
home invasion, according to authorities.

After the attack, his DNA was allegedly found in a Jeep that was stolen from the family and taken to New York.

Nicolescu's
attorney said in court papers filed Tuesday that the attempted 
extortion charges should be dismissed because federal authorities lack 
jurisdiction. Nicolescu's attorneys say the law allows federal 
prosecution of robbery or extortion that interferes with interstate 
commerce but the crime lacks such an apparent link 'other than the fact 
that one of the victims is extremely wealthy.'

Nicolescu's lawyer Audrey Felsen told jurors that the butler 'did not do the crimes.He did not particpate in them, He din;t plan them. He didn't help anybody plan them. He didn't knowingly help anybody after the fact.'

Nicolescu
was born in Romania and came to the United States after his father 
sought political asylum as a refugee, his attorney said, according to 
court papers. Nicolescu has Romanian and U.S. citizenship.

He has 
been detained since his arrest in Chicago last year. A judge called him a
flight risk, saying he has strong ties overseas and faces a long 
sentence if convicted.

Nicolescu is charged with attempted 
extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, and possession of a stolen 
vehicle. He faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted at the trial 
beginning Wednesday.

About six days after the crime, an accordion 
case washed ashore in New York that included a stun gun, knife, black 
plastic airsoft gun, crowbar, syringes, sleeping tablets, green latex 
gloves and a laminated telephone card labeled with the address of the 
victim.

A co-defendant who is at large is an accordion player, prosecutors say.
