Campaign: Paul Lamb has launched a legal battle for the right to ask a doctor to end his life

A paralysed man is fighting for the right to die with the help of a doctor, taking up the case begun by Tony Nicklinson.

Paul Lamb, 58, only has slight movement in his right hand after a car accident in 1990.

Next month, he will tell the Appeal Court that a doctor who acted to kill him would be carrying out a necessary procedure to end his suffering.

Mr Nicklinson died last year at the age of 58 just days after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor's help, but his family won permission to continue his campaign.

Mr Lamb said his life is so pointless that he often goes to bed at 5pm. But he is not physically able to kill himself and any doctor who helped him would be guilty of murder.

Mr
Lamb, from Leeds, told the BBC: 'I just badly would like to see this 
law changed and then have that choice to just say, as and when I choose, call it a day.'

He
was severely injured in a car accident in 1990, which he does not remember, and has no function in 
any of his limbs apart from a little movement in his right hand.

In
a statement to the courts, the father-of two said: 'I 
am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have lived with 
these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot

'Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel I cannot and do not want to keep living. I feel trapped by the situation and have no way out.

'I spend my day sitting in my wheelchair. My daily routine is tedious, monotonous and pointless. I often go to bed at 5pm - such is the pointlessness of it all.

'I am fed up of going through the motions of life rather than living it. I feel enough is enough.'

Case: Mr Lamb is continuing the campaign started by Tony Nicklinson, pictured shortly before his death when he was told his High Court appeal had failed on August 16

He is seeking a formal statement that
any doctor who helped him to end his life would be doing so out of 
'necessity' and would therefore be immune from prosecution.

Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, who has continued the right-to-die campaign following her husband's death in August, expressed her gratitude to Mr Lamb for bringing his case to public attention.

'He is in constant pain,' she told BBC Breakfast.

'He's had this for 23 years and nothing they do will alleviate the pain and he's had enough. He's just tired of living like this.'

Mrs Nicklinson said there was a 'huge amount of support' for a move to change the law, adding: 'In my mind, the severely disabled are being blatantly discriminated against. Why shouldn't they have the same rights as everyone else?

'There would obviously be huge safeguards put in place so that people are protected. I know for a fact that there are many, many severely disabled people or people that have degenerative illnesses that know that one day, they will be severely disabled, that want a change in the law.'

Mr Nicklinson was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to Athens in 2005.

He was left crestfallen by a High Court decision ruling against his wish to end his life last year, and died a few days later after he began refusing food.

Mrs Nicklinson later vowed to continue the legal battle because it was 'part of Tony's legacy'.

Mr Lamb said if he won a change in the 'cruel' law to secure protection from prosecution for a doctor who helped him take his life, he would die a 'very proud man'.

In an interview broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: 'The quality of life is not there and I just think I have done everything I can, I've tried everything.'

He said he was in 'horrendous' pain, adding: 'My will has gone. I think I'm worn down, worn out. I'm not getting any younger and I just badly want to see this law changed.'

Mr Lamb said he wanted to be able to die 'with all my loved ones around me that I care about, in my bed, to have the ability to feel comfortable'.

Disability charity Scope today strongly opposed any changes to the law and said Mr Lamb's views are not shared by many disabled people.

Scope's chief executive, Richard Hawkes, said: 'It is important that the views of Paul Lamb, who has taken up the legal challenge begun by the late Tony Nicklinson, are set in context.

'Although many people will sympathise with these cases, we must remember that the current law on assisted suicide protects the lives of disabled people in Britain.

'Many disabled people tell us that without this legal protection, they would live under the assumption that they are a burden on society more widely and their loved ones.

'We must avoid any temptation to change assisted suicide laws based on a couple of undeniably heart-wrenching and tragic cases. Many disabled people are against any weakening of the law, and their voices need to be heard in this debate.'

Nikki Kenward, a disabled former victim of locked-in syndrome who runs the Distant Voices group, said: ‘Just when we thought we might have a place in society, along comes another “my life isn’t worth living” campaign.

‘I’m insulted, alienated and tired of the sense of being on a list of people who qualify for assisted death.’
