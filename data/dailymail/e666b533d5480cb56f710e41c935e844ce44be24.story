Tony Pulis has revealed that his 38-year marriage came close to breaking point before the end of his spell as Crystal Palace manager.

The 56-year-old has been with his wife Debs since he was just 18, but admits the amount of time he was spending in crunch transfer talks with Steve Parish was putting a strain on his relationship.

He told The Sun: 'My wife nearly left me for the first time in the 38 years we've been together.

'But I'll move on. I'm football daft. I've worked my socks off for months to keep Palace up and then in the break.

Last season's Premier League Manager of the Year left Palace this summer despite saving them from almost certain relegation.

With Palace still in search of a permanent manager, Pulis is bizarrely still in the frame to go back to Selhurst Park.

Pulis added: It was mutually agreed we part company, which was disappointing as I'd spent five weeks getting the players ready for the season.
