Liverpool have provided the biggest indication yet that Luis Suarez will remain at the club this summer after managing director Ian Ayre provided compelling assurances to the club's major sponsors, Standard Chartered.

Sportsmail understands that Ayre delivered an address on Monday morning in front of a watching audience - including Peter Sands, the group chief executive of Standard Chartered PLC - at the bank's London headquarters, where the Liverpool chief was joined by Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish.

Standard Chartered have been the club's main shirt sponsor since 2010 and their current deal is estimated to be worth in the region of £20million a year and will run until the end of the 2015/16 campaign.

Going nowhere: Luis Suarez will not be sold in the summer, according to Ian Ayre

Such financial commitment brings grand expectations and Sportsmail understands that the sponsors were impressed to hear a rousing talk from Ayre, who maintained that Liverpool are confident that Suarez will remain at the club and he also revealed that the club are hopeful that their identified summer transfer targets will be signed as Brendan Rodgers' side seek to impress in European competition next season.

Although Ayre admitted that Liverpool's remarkable success in the Premier League this season could see the vultures circle around Suarez in the summer transfer window, with Manchester City and Real Madrid understood to be monitoring the Uruguayan, the managing director insisted that the club is not in the business of selling its star assets.

In a significant demonstration of the club's ambition in front of leading Standard Chartered officials, Ayre is also understood to have cited a strong working relationship with both Suarez and his agent, praising the striker as quiet, family man whose off-field conduct has impressed many within the walls of Anfield in recent times.

Consistent: Liverpool have repeatedly knocked back any transfer interest in Suarez since he arrived

Liverpool, who currently sit top of the Barclays Premier League with five games remaining, believe that the motivation behind the Uruguayan forward's discontent last summer was solely based upon his wish to compete on the biggest stage, rather than any desire to squeeze more cash out of his employers or to earn more money elsewhere.

However, as Liverpool have now guaranteed that they will dine at Europe's top table with UEFA Champions League football next season, the club are convinced that he will remain at Anfield and that he will remain true to the new four-and-a-half year contract that he signed in December.

To ensure that Liverpool build upon their most encouraging campaign for many years, it is understood that background checks have already been made on the mentality and attitude of the key targets that the Brendan Rodgers would like to bring in to Anfield this summer and Sportsmail understands that preliminary contact has been made with several clubs in anticipation of the summer transfer window. The emphasis is on players that will enrich and blend into the current squad, rather than disrupt the current set-up.

Although Ayre did not make direct reference to Brendan Rodgers' contract situation, Sportsmail believes that he indicated to the sponsors that long-term deals are in the pipeline for key members of the club's staff at the end of this season, stressing that Liverpool are determined to commit to this new era under their Northern Irish manager.

Rodgers' current contract is set to expire in the summer of 2015 but there is an appetite from both the manager and the board to extend that deal when the time is right - most probably in the close season.

Meanwhile, Liverpool are also moving gradually closer to securing a long-awaited expansion of the club's Anfield stadium.

The club need to acquire one last block of flats to secure the expansion but they are increasingly confident that any remaining issues will soon be resolved and that planning permission will be granted in the near future, as Liverpool aim to bring their all-seater capacity up to 60,000.

The possibility of moving from the club's iconic home is now a none-starter, with Liverpool's owner John W Henry underlining his feelings to the board that nothing can replicate the unique 'feeling' inside Anfield.
