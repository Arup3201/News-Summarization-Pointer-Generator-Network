The family of an autistic boy are at loggerheads with their local school district in Sherwood, Oregon, which is refusing to provide a handler to oversee their son's service dog.

For the past three months John McDonald, 6, has attended class at Middleton Elementary without his autism service dog, Kai, because of the impasse between the family and Sherwood School District.

Parents Jennifer and Scott McDonald's raised $13,500 to purchase Kai to help their son who is nonverbal and has a tendency to run away when he gets anxious.

John McDonald's parents are at loggerheads with their local school district in Sherwood, Oregon, which is refusing to provide a handler to oversee their son's service dog Kai during class

On Wednesday morning, Jennifer McDonald took her son and Kai to class in the hope that school staff would take Kai's leash and lead them inside

According to mom Jennifer, the 70-pound Labrador helps her son keep calm and allows him to better focus in class.

The school originally welcomed the idea of allowing a service dog in class. They replaced carpet with bare floors and paid for the Autism Service Dogs of America to train staff to work with Kai.

Then the district told the McDonalds that they required a dog handler be to present at all times and that under the Americans with Disabilities Act they would have to pay.

'I guess I was naive. I thought - it's a service dog, he's allowed to go in public places. He's mandated that he can go with John anywhere,' McDonald told KGW. 'It never occurred to me that it would come up to something like this

The family doesn't believe a handler is necessary and say the district is misinterpreting the regulations. They filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Department of Justice in December.

The family's attorneys also point to a recent court case in Florida where a judge ruled that a service dog is no different than helping a blind child deploy a cane, reports The Oregonian.

Instead Middleton Principal Jeremiah Patterson told Jennifer that the district is standing by its decision that the family must provide a dog's handler for Kai

John McDonald, 6, has autism and so his parent's raised $13,500 to train Kai, a service dog who helps him to remain calm and safe

Jennifer McDonald says her son is being discriminated against and that the Americans with Disabilities Act states that the school should pay for a dig handler because it is they who claim it is necessary

The judge ruled, 'The (Florida) district's failure to provide an employee to assist the child with the dog's routine care amounted to a failure to accommodate.'

The U.S. Department of Justice also issued a statement in the case, saying the school district's failure to make reasonable accommodations to facilities and practices was discriminatory.

The family are waiting for a legal verdict,but said that time is also critical as the longer the boy and dog are apart, the more their bond deteriorates. 

On Wednesday morning, Jennifer McDonald took her son and Kai to class in the hope that school staff would take Kai's leash and lead them inside.

Instead Middleton Principal Jeremiah Patterson  told Jennifer that the district is standing by its decision that the family must provide the dog's handler. 

'The District communicated to the parents that, under the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the dog is welcome in the classroom as long as either a parent or someone the parents arrange is in the classroom to supervise and care for the dog,' said the school in a statement on Wednesday.

'However, the request of the parents that the District provide supervision and care for the dog involves expenditure of public funds and the assignment of additional staff. These are of great concern to the District, acting as a steward of public funds.'
