Mitt Romney expressed understandable concern following the dramatic emergency landing of his wife Ann's plane due to a fire on board -  before offering a surprising solution to the problem.

The Republican presidential candidate told a fundraiser in Beverly Hills at the weekend that the fundamental design of airplanes was flawed for dealing with such emergencies.

Romney said: 'When you have a fire in an aircraft, 
there’s no place to go, exactly, there’s no - and you can’t find any 
oxygen from outside the aircraft to get in the aircraft, because the 
windows don’t open.

Plane stupid? Mitt Romney told a fundraiser in Beverly Hills that it was 'very dangerous' that the windows didn't open on his wife's plane during an electrical fire

'I don’t know why they don’t do that. It’s a real 
problem. So it’s very dangerous.'

The bizarre grasp of aviation did not appear to be a joke, as Romney also told the Los Angeles Times that he was extremely concerned about his wife's safety.

He also said: 'I appreciate the fact that she is on the ground, safe and sound. And I don’t think she knows just how worried some of us were.'

According to aviation experts, opening a plane window would have flooded the cabin with oxygen, fueled the fire and caused a loss of cabin pressure that could have ripped apart the fuselage.

The presidential candidate was widely mocked for his remarks. The Daily Kos wrote: 'Yeah, great question Mitt. I mean, wouldn't it be awesome to be able to crack the window when you're at 35,000 feet? You know, get a taste of that 500+ mile per hour breeze?'

Meanwhile MSNBC's Rachel Maddo wsaid : 'It's a real problem that the windows don't roll down on 
airplanes? Is it also a problem that guns don't shoot backwards through 
the barrel this way?'

Mrs Romney's plane made a dramatic emergency landing on Friday afternoon after an electrical fire broke out on board.

Smoke filled the cabin of the aircraft on its way to Los Angeles forcing the pilot to ground the plane unexpectedly in Colorado.

Ann Romney and other passengers on the flight were unharmed in the incident.

In a recorded conversation between the plane and the airport's flight tower, a man's voice can be heard saying: 'We have an electrical issue here and we’re going to declare an emergency.'

'Safe and sound': Romney expressed relief that his wife Ann was unharmed after her plane made an emergency landing en route to a political fundraiser

'We’ll probably need assistance here,' the man, presumably the pilot, added, before explaining 'we got smoke in the cabin'.

Mrs Romney's flight was at 40,000 feet when it turned around to make the emergency landing. Passengers were instructed by crew members to put their seat belts on during the grounding.

Romney spokesman Sarah Haley, who was on the aircraft with Mrs Romney, said the plane, a Canadair CL-60 regional jet, was surrounded by fire trucks when it landed at the airport.

Romney's fundraiser in California raked in $6million in for the campaign coffers with 1,500 supporters paying $50,000 to hear Romney speak at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

Romney's press office did not immediately have a comment for MailOnline.
