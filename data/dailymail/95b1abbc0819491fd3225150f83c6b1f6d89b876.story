Rangers chairman David Somers was accused  of being 'disingenuous' after claiming Dave King's failure to provide proof of funds and identify members of his consortium made it impossible to accept the South African-based businessman's offer of investment in the troubled Ibrox club.

A proposal from King's group was considered last month along with another from Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy before the Ibrox board finally accepted a £2million interest-free bailout from existing shareholder Mike Ashley.

The Newcastle United owner subsequently increased that amount by a further £1m, with the total loan amount secured against the Glasgow club's Edmiston House and Albion car park properties.

In a rare interview on Tuesday, Somers spoke publicly for the first time on why the club had turned down former Ibrox director King, who was also looking for 51 per cent of Rangers shares in return for his consortium's £16m investment.

But the Ibrox chairman – who claimed that he could not tell shareholders 'hand on heart that these guys have got the money' - provoked a furious response from King's consortium.

They claimed proof of funds was available 'immediately' but that Sandy Easdale, chairman of the Rangers football board, had agreed that the information could be provided once the backing of shareholders was confirmed.

'We had three people offering us funds,' said Somers. 'And I felt it was very important we do proper due diligence on all three.

'In the past, Rangers has perhaps done deals it wouldn't have if it had done proper due diligence.

'Where (the King offer) fell down was really at stage one. When I said to all three of these people: "Would you show me proof of funds?", two showed me proof of funds. The consortium did not.

'The second question for the consortium was: 'I know there are eight of you, I only know three of you. Can I please have the other five names?' And the message I was getting all the time was: 'If you agree to do deal, if you persuade 75 per cent of shareholders, then we'll show you funds and you can have the other names'.

'It wasn't meeting the due diligence requirements. The simple questions were: 'Show me the money' and 'Give me the names'.

'I cannot go to the shareholders with a deal where I don't know all of the names and I can't check (those) names out. I can't go to the shareholders and say with my hand on my heart that these guys have got the money.

'With the other two people I could. We went round the houses and in the end we moved on to stage two with two providers (Ashley and Kennedy).'

Sports Direct billionaire Ashley, who controls just under nine per cent of Rangers, also runs the club's retail arm. But when he gave the club a further £1m earlier this month he relinquished the rights to rename Ibrox Stadium that he had purchased for just £1 from former Rangers chief executive Charles Green.

Somers insisted Ashley's security demands on the car park and Edmiston House were less onerous than what was on the table from Kennedy. He added that Ashley's loans being interest-free, coupled with the Newcastle United owner's commercial interest in seeing Rangers thrive, represented the best deal for the club.

'It was a simple question of which provider was offering the lowest interest rate and Mike Ashley was offering zero interest rate, which was difficult to beat,' said Somers.

'And (it was about) which provider wanted the least security. Again, Mike Ashley wanted Edmiston House and the car park, but it was a small amount of security relative to the other deal. Once we got to that stage, it was a no-brainer which one we were going with.

'Also I think Mike Ashley had the advantage because we have an important joint-venture with him, with the merchandising agreement, which is important to us. We make quite a lot of money from it. He and we are both keen that Rangers has financial stability because we will both benefit.'

While Tuesday was the first time Somers had gone public to explain in detail why the King and Kennedy deals were turned down, his comments echoed an earlier statement Rangers issued to the stock exchange on November 12.

On Tuesday night, however, King said Somers was 'being disingenuous with his comments'. In a statement, the businessman added: 'We had private discussions with both (former chief executive) Graham Wallace and Sandy Easdale in which we told them that we would immediately provide proof of funding and details of the full make-up of the consortium following confirmation from Sandy Easdale that the shareholders whom he represents were prepared to support the terms of our investment proposal in principle.

'Sandy Easdale agreed to proceed on this basis. Unfortunately, he was not then able to provide the confirmation we asked for. There was no possibility of proceeding any further without the support of Sandy Easdale's group who had the power to block our proposed investment.'

Brian Kennedy was not available for comment on Tuesday night.
