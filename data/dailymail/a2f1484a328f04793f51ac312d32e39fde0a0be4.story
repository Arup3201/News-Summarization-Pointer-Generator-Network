An estimated 290 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, up by more than a quarter – 26 per cent – compared with the 230 who died in 2011.

Road-safety experts said the figures are alarming as they buck the trend of otherwise falling road casualties and point to a hard core of persistent drink-drivers.

The figure for 2011 had been the lowest since records began in 1979.

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents called for a lower drink-drive limit and tougher powers for police to carry out random breath tests, which the Government rejects.

Critics also blamed cuts in budgets for road safety and anti drink-drive campaigns.

Ministers denied accusations that they are complacent over the issue and admitted they are worried by the latest Department for Transport statistics.

The 290 drink-drive deaths in 2012 represented around one in six (17 per cent) of all reported road fatalities in the year.

Overall there were 250 fatal drink-drive accidents in 2012, compared with 220 in 2011. This is despite the number of accidents involving drink-driving last year falling slightly to 6,680 from the 2011 figure of 6,690.

Of those killed in drink-drive accidents, two-thirds (68 per cent) were drivers and riders over the legal alcohol limit.

The remaining third (32 per cent) were other road users, involved in the accident but not necessarily over the legal limit themselves.

The number seriously injured in drink-drive accidents was 1,210 in 2012, down from 1,270 in 2011. But slight injuries in drink-drive accidents rose to 8,500 last year from 8,420.

The Department for Transport said that despite the big increase in deaths in 2012, the number of drink-drive fatalities was still around 25 per cent lower than in 2009 and almost 40 per cent lower than the 2005 to 2009 average.

The annual fatality figure has come down considerably since the late 1970s and 1980s when 1,400 or more deaths a year were recorded, and is now around a fifth of that.

The figure hovered around the 530 to 580 mark in the first years of this century before dipping sharply over the period 2007 to 2011.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said the figures were provisional, but accepted: ‘Any road death is one too many and we are absolutely not complacent when it comes to road safety. We are very concerned about it. We take it very seriously.

‘That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink-driving, including approving portable evidential breath-testing equipment which will allow for more effective and efficient enforcement.’ He added: ‘Road deaths are thankfully at their lowest since records began in 1926.’

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Drink-driving is a menace to everyone on our roads and it is very disappointing to see that the estimated number of fatalities as a result of drunk drivers has increased. Behind every statistic is a personal tragedy that could have been avoided for these 290 people.

‘We need to keep reinforcing the message that drinking and driving don’t mix.

‘All drivers need to take heed of this and ensure that if they are going to be driving, that they adopt a zero-tolerance approach and don’t drink anything alcoholic at all.’

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents called on the Government to lower the drink-drive limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg per 100ml and follow the lead of ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, who are pursuing a change to the law which is being resisted in Whitehall.
