Phil Mickelson lost his cool with an on-course TV cameraman during his fourball tie on the opening morning of the Ryder Cup.

Mickelson, paired with Keegan Bradley, snapped at the cameraman for getting too close to the action.

Bradley's caddie Steve 'Pepsi' Hale warned the cameraman not to get too close to the action on the sixth tee, but an earpiece prevented him from hearing.

Tensions were already high as Mickelson faces Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy in the morning fourball, having been involved in a spat with the latter in the lead up to the opening day.

McIlroy hit back at Mickelson's taunts ahead of the Ryder Cup by telling him: 'At least we're not wanted by the FBI!' 

McIlroy was responding to a comment by the American on Wednesday about the ongoing court case involving the former management company that also represents his fellow Ulsterman Graeme McDowell.

Mickelson was asked an innocuous question about unity in the American camp and replied: 'Well, not only are we able to play together, we also don't litigate against each other and that's a real plus, I feel, heading into this week.'

But McIlroy, who will partner Sergio Garcia in a fourball clash with Mickelson and Keegan Bradley on Friday, countered by referencing Mickelson's contact with the FBI over allegations of involvement in an insider trading scandal worth millions of dollars.

Mickelson was later cleared of any direct involvement but the FBI said they would continue to investigate.

McIlroy said: 'I got a couple of jabs back at him at the gala dinner. I know Phil well and we had a couple of laughs about it. We took it well.

'Myself and G-Mac confronted him at the gala dinner and I had a couple of goes. It was all good fun.'

McDowell also insisted it was all taken in jest: 'Rory and I are very comfortable with the situation at this point.

'Obviously Phil hasn't really read any of the quotes over the last couple of weeks.'

He added: 'So did we bring up the FBI? We didn't mention that at all! I don't think they have any jurisdiction here in Scotland!

'It was a bit of a wind-up. Bit of craic.'
