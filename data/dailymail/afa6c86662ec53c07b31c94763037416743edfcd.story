Large parts of golfing America might still be in denial but Rory McIlroy spelt out the facts regarding long-time superstars Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in characteristically candid terms on Wednesday.

Asked about the absence of both from the field who will contest the season-ending Tour Championship here at East Lake for the first time since 1992, McIlroy responded: ‘I don’t know if I would say their era is over but it is a fact they’re getting older and playing the last few holes of their careers.’

How Rory McIlroy or Justin Rose could win the $10 million FedEx bonus …

Rory McIlroy

Will claim that sum if he wins the Tour Championship — not to mention the $1.44m first prize — and has a reasonable chance if he finishes second. A slim chance if he finishes as low as tied third.

Justin Rose

Must win the Tour Championship and hope Chris Kirk finishes worse than 21st, Billy Horschel worse than sixth, Bubba Watson worse than fourth, and McIlroy, Hunter Mahan and Jimmy Walker are outside the top three.

By the same token, the new poster boy is stepping up to the plate nicely with a very tidy front nine. This season McIlroy has played 16 events that count on the PGA Tour and registered three wins, eight other top 10s and never once finished outside the top 25. He can reflect on a year where he not only won two majors but also addressed the vexed issue of his inconsistency.

Now comes the chance to add a little stardust. If he wins this event, with its $1.44million (£890,000) first prize, he will also collect the $10m (£6.18m) bonus for the FedEx Cup.

McIlroy caused a few wry chuckles when he described it initially as a ‘nice bit of extra money’. It made you wonder what would be a considerable sum, before he elaborated. 

‘It is obviously a lot of money to anyone, but I have been lucky enough to make a lot of money on the PGA Tour,’ he said. ‘One of the few things I haven’t achieved is a FedEx Cup, so that’s the real reason I want to win this week.

‘I just want to finish the year off well. Yes, the money is great, but the title would mean more to me, and after the year I’ve had it would be disappointing not to pull it off. I’ve only got 28 other players to beat here. It’s not like a regular event where you have to beat 155.’

McIlroy, 25, rounded off his time in Denver last week with a visit to Mile High Stadium to watch a little American football in the shape of the Denver Broncos against the Indianapolis Colts. He spent time down on the field and came away sounding like he was glad he played golf for a living.

‘Wow, there are some big boys who play that game,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘The hits. The speed. It’s no surprise to me that two or three guys a game get injured. Some of the wide receivers and the running backs are amazing. To my mind, they’re the most impressive athletes in sport. You have to have it all in that game.’

The following morning, he was due to fly to Atlanta before having a last-minute change of heart, a re-routing to south Florida and a night at home for the first time in two months. ‘It really is amazing what a night in your own bed can do,’ he said.

‘I stood in the shower in Denver and said to myself, “Why am I going to Atlanta today?” So I got to dump a little luggage that I have been carrying with me the past few weeks, practise at the Bear’s Club nearby and work out at home in the gym. It was a lovely, relaxing day and I come here feeling refreshed.’

If he feels that way after a night in his own bed, Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley must be hoping he opts for seven days at home next week before heading off to Gleneagles, where his workload will almost certainly include five matches.

As for his practice session, did he work on his putting by any chance? ‘Yes, and there were no four putts either,’ he said, smiling, in reference to four-putting the same hole two days running at the BMW Championship last week.

‘It was just a complete anomaly. I can see where I lost concentration on the third putt on Saturday, but on Sunday I grinded on all of them. You just have to write it off as one of those things and hopefully there will be no more this week.’

The other UK representative here is Justin Rose, who can also claim the $10m bonus but only if a complex sequence of events goes his way. ‘I quite like being one of the dark horses because the pressure is on the top guys to finish the job off,’ he argued. ‘I can just go for it, with nothing to lose.’

Even if he doesn’t pull it off, there’s still plenty of FedEx loot to play for, with even the man who finishes fifth in the bonus pool collecting more than $1m. A nice bit of extra money, by any standard.
