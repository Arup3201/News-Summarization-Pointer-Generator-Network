Brett Fuller, a NSW taxi driver, saved the life of 18-year-old Alexis Felstein who was the victim of an alleged random stabbing attack 

Police have praised the actions of a taxi driver who risked his own life to save an 18-year-old woman from an alleged vicious attack.

Alexis Felstein was randomly attacked by a 22-year-old man at Lismore in northern New South Wales in the early hours of Saturday morning according to police, when a passing taxi driver stopped to intervene.

Brett Fuller noticed Ms Felstein, who he told the Northern Star was 'covered in blood' and 'screaming', when he pulled over and took her into his cab.

'I thought I was going to die, there was so much blood,' Ms Felstein said of her ordeal.

Mr Fuller immediately contacted police and advised them of the alleged attacker's car registration details before rushing Ms Felstein to the closest hospital.

The teenage victim had sustained multiple wounds to her head, arm and upper body during the alleged stabbing and was taken in for emergency surgery.

She was later moved to Gold Coast University Hospital for microsurgery on her arm.

Cameron Lindsay, the crime manager for the Richmond Local Area Command, told the Northern Star that Mr Fuller's actions saved Ms Felstein's life.

'To approach this person and also take care of the victim in his taxis, that allowed the police to commandeer the taxi and take the taxi and the victim to hospital. Without that quick action and taking that victim to hospital, she would have died,' Mr Lindsay said.

However Mr Fuller has deflected all praise, instead turning the attention to Ms Felstein who he called 'the bravest girl in the world'.

Mr Lindsay also applauded Mr Fuller's quick thinking.

The cab driver's actions of recording the alleged attacker's registration details led police to arrest the 22-year-old driver of a white Daihatsu Charade on the same night that Ms Felstein was allegedly attacked.

A 22-year-old man has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent to murder and reckless wounding, and appeared at Lismore Local Court on Saturday

The man was arrested after a police chase which ended with his car hitting a roundabout and bursting into flames.

He was charged with grievous bodily harm with intent to murder and reckless wounding, and appeared at Lismore Local Court on Saturday.

Police revealed that a knife was found in the 22-year-old's car, which will be forensically examined.
