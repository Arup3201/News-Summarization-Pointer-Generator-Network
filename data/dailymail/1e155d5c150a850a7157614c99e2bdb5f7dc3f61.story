Employees at JP Morgan have held a minute's silence today for a bank executive who died after jumping 500ft from the top of the bank's European headquarters in London yesterday.

Gabriel Magee, an American senior manager, 39, fell from the 33-storey skyscraper at around 8am and was found on the ninth floor roof, which surrounds the Canary Wharf skyscraper.

His body was left in full view of City workers in surrounding buildings for up to four hours as police investigated the death.

Tragedy: IT executive Gabriel Magee was found dead at the end of January after jumping from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, and landing on a surrounding roof

He was a vice president in the corporate and investment bank technology department having joined in 2004, moving to Britain from the United States in 2007.

Employees gathered to remember their colleague in a minute's silence this morning, according to Twitter reports.

Mr Magee, who lived in North London, was an expert in highly specialist software which reaps huge profits for the US company by predicting market patterns.

It is understood that Mr Magee’s girlfriend had reported him missing the previous evening.

He was named in an email sent to all JP Morgan staff yesterday afternoon.

A company spokesman said: 'We are 
deeply saddened to have lost a member of the J.P. Morgan family at 25 
Bank Street today.  Our thoughts and sympathy are with his family and 
his friends'.

A source close to Mr Magee said he was in 'good standing with his bosses and colleagues. He was well liked.'

Scotland Yard said they were called to 25 Bank Street at 8.02am and detectives are not treating the death as suspicious.

'No arrests have been made and the incident is being treated as non-suspicious at this early stage', a Met spokesman said.

Senior colleagues were last night investigating Mr Magee’s  recent workload as rumours swirled around the City over what may have prompted his death.

Last night a colleague said: ‘They’re going to be going through his stuff to try to find out if  he’d made some kind of terrible error. It’s possible he had been in the office all night trying to put it right before the fall.’

Canary Wharf workers were in shock after the death, with one trader telling MailOnline that his body lay on the flat roof until around midday.

Investigation: Police at the scene outside the JP Morgan building this morning, where the man was found dead at around 8am

A former Deutsche Bank executive has been found dead at a house in London, it emerged today.

The body of William ‘Bill’ Broeksmit, 58, was discovered at his home in South Kensington on Sunday by police.

Mr Broeksmit - who retired last February - was a former senior manager with close ties to co-chief executive Anshu Jain.

Mr
 Jain and co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen said in an internal memo: 
‘He was considered by many of his peers to be among the finest minds in 
the fields of risk and capital management.'

They
 added: ‘We are deeply saddened by Bill's death. He was a dear friend 
and colleague to many of us who benefitted from his intellect and 
wisdom.

‘Our thoughts 
and condolences are with his wife and family at this time. We will 
remember him for his contributions to Deutsche Bank, thoughtful advice 
and personal friendship.’

Mr
 Broeksmit worked in investment banking - specifically risk and 
securities - and lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, 
which has an average property value of £1.9million.

'My colleague yelled that he could see
 that someone had jumped from the top of the building onto a lower roof.
 His body lay there uncovered for at least two hours,' he said.

'Hundreds were looking out of their windows at him.

'It was bonus week at JP Morgan last week so I hope it wasn't to do with that'.

Another Canary Wharf worker who could see where the man fell told the Evening Standard: 'It’s upsetting what’s happened but the thought of somebody lying up there for four hours is awful.

'I got into the office at about 8.10 and the body was on the floor and there were police up there, and they put a white cover on him.

'I think he was in a suit. As far as I could see the was dressed appropriately, but there was quite a lot of blood, so me and my colleagues were a bit upset.'

Others tweeted that what they saw this morning.

Amie Hughes-Gage said: 'Just watched the 
police finally remove that poor bankers body 4 and half hours later with
 only a white sheet over him.'

Hetal Patel tweeted: 'The 9th floor roof of JP Morgan is visible from my office window. For a long time the body was left cordoned & unattended'.

Another wrote online: 'It's not a nice view from my building. The body is on the rooftop of level 9. So sad'.

An air ambulance was sent to the scene but the man could not be saved.

'We were called to Bank Street to reports of a person fallen form a height', London Ambulance Service spokesman said:

'We sent one ambulance crew, a duty officer, our hazardous area response team and London Air Ambulance to the scene.

'Sadly a man in his 30s was pronounced dead at the scene.'

JP Morgan's building has been the headquarters of the bank's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operation since July 2012. 

It used to be owned by Lehman Brothers 
until its collapse in 2008, and the area houses the headquarters of 
other banking giants including HSBC and Barclays.
