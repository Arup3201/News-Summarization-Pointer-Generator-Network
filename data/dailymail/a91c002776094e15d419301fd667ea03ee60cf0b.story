A father and son died trying out new diving equipment they received as presents for Christmas while attempting to descend into a cave that's been described as the 'Grand Canyon' and 'Mount Everest' of diving.

Brooksville, Florida native Darrin Spivey, 35, and his 15-year-old son  Dillon Sanchez arrived at the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Refuge around 11am Christmas morning to dive into the 300-foot Eagles Nest Sink.

But Spivey's fiancee Holly King started to worry when the two didn't return and she couldn't get through to Spivey on his cell phone.

Recovery divers found the tragic pair 67 and another 127 feet below the surface

She finally drove out there herself and found their car was still parked in the lot. At that point, around 7:30 she called police.

Recovery divers started searching the waters an hour later and found both bodies in the main cavern area between 11pm and midnight. They found the boy's body at 67 feet and his father's at a further 127 feet.

'It was very unfortunate. Our hearts and prayers go out to the family and friends,' Assistant Hernando County Fire Chief Kevin Carroll told the Tampa Bay Tribune.

Incredibly dangerous: The Eagles Nest Sink in the Chassahowitzka River is described as 'one of the top three extreme dives in the world'

While deputies described Spivey as an experienced diver, he was not a cave diver. His high-schooler son, they say, was not a certified diver.

On the approach to Eagles Nest Sink, there are warning signs that tell just how dangerous the diving there is.

Diving site Aquaviews.net has named the Floirida cave as 'one of the top three extreme dives in the world'. 

Gruesome underwater discovery: Spivey's fiancee Holly King noticed something was wrong when the two didn't come home by 3pm. Recovery divers found their bodies later that night

'Only for highly experienced cave divers and the technically sound, the descent of Eagle's nest is similar to that of a chimney and hundreds of feet below it opens up into a large cavern called "the Main Ballroom", beyond which are longer tunnels and crannies that go even deeper,' the website said.

Multiple divers have perished attempting the descent into Eagles Nest Sink over the past 20 years.

The deaths are still under investigation, and authorities said they would be checking the equipmet the father and son used.
