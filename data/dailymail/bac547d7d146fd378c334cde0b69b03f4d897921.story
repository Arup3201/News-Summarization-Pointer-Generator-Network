A little girl who was nearly suffocated by a birthmark is now beaming after surgeons rebuilt her disfigured nose.

Despite being born prematurely at 27-weeks, Zoe Mitchell was a healthy baby and progressed well while in hospital.

But within days, a small red mark across the bridge of her nose - thought to be as a result of an oxygen mask being too tight - developed into a huge, purple, blister which started to suffocate her.Doctors diagnosed a haemangioma, a birthmark caused by a benign tumour of the blood vessels in the skin.

Zoe (pictured, left, at six-months-old and, right, now) had a haemangioma - a birthmark caused by a benign tumour of the blood vessels in the skin. It was so large that it made it impossible for her to breathe normally

It can grow rapidly and in severe cases, such as Zoe’s, it can block the airways.

In a race against time, doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London had to fit a tracheostomy tube when Zoe was just eight-weeks-old to stop her suffocating.

Since then, she has been on a long journey and now, at the age of nine, is all smiles again after surgeons reconstructed her nose using cartilage from her ear.

Her mother, Caroline, 36, from Welling in Kent, said: ‘Zoe is so happy with it now. She is delighted with her new nose. It looks lovely. It is amazing.’

Zoe’s birthmark attracted cruel comments and stares until she had her first operation to remove the majority of it when she was four.

Mrs Mitchell, a legal secretary, said: ‘We went ahead with the operation because we wanted her to look a bit “normal”. Going out every day and having people staring at you is not nice so we did it for her appearance.

Zoe (pictured at two-weeks-old) was born prematurely at just 27-weeks. She had a red mark on her nose which was thought to have been caused by an oxygen mask

The mark grew quickly damaging Zoe's nose and putting her at risk of suffocation. Her parents say it was lucky that she was premature as it meant she was already in hospital when the growth started to affect her breathing. Zoe us pictured at five-weeks-old

‘We have always been open with her about it. We told her that is her birthmark, her special nose. She got more aware of people staring as she has got older.’

Zoe also risked losing her eyesight as the tumour had got bigger and bigger and eventually took over her whole nose when she was just seven-weeks-old.

Doctors put her on steroids in an attempt to shrink the growth but when that didn’t work Zoe, she started a 12-month course of chemotherapy in a bid to zap the tumour.

Zoe was put on steroids but they failed to shrink the growth so she had a 12-month course of chemotherapy as well as surgery to remove most of the growth. She is pictured at 12-months-old

Recalling the ordeal, her mother said: ‘It was getting bigger and bigger and growing over the bridge of her nose, obscuring her eyes so rather than having round, football shaped eyes they were becoming shaped like a rugby ball from where the tumour was damaging them.

‘When they first said it was a birthmark I just thought it would be a little red mark. I’d never heard of them being raised tumours and had no idea they can do so much damage.

‘It was very daunting and stressful. It was constant hospital appointments in the first year so it was quite intense.’

The tracheostomy was removed when Zoe was 18-months-old but her nose remained disfigured so she had to have further surgery to rebuild it. She is pictured at the age of two

In July this year surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London operated to rebuild her nose. She said she is very happy with her new nose

It was only once the tumour had shrunk enough that Zoe was able to breathe unaided and the tracheostomy tube was removed after 18-months.

But her nose was left disfigured and so Mrs Mitchell and her husband Dean, 36, consulted plastic surgeons at Great Ormond Street, who were able to re-build her nose.

Mrs Mitchell, who also has a 12-year-old son, continued: ‘The damage it could have caused if it was not spotted straight away could have been fatal - it could have suffocated her.

Zoe said: 'I think my new nose looks lovely now. I think my surgeon is very clever. I am very happy now'

Zoe's mother, Caroline, said: 'We went ahead with the operation because we wanted her to look a bit "normal". Going out every day and having people staring at you is not nice so we did it for her appearance'

‘We were really lucky that she was born so prematurely in a way as we were already in the hospital when it was spotted so we were referred straight away.

‘The last operation was quite painful for her. She has got on so well.

‘She might have to have more surgery later on but not until she is about 16.’

Mrs Mitchell said: 'Zoe is so happy with it now. She is delighted with her new nose. It looks lovely. It is amazing'

Zoe will probably need more surgery when she is 16. She is pictured with her mother Caroline, father Dean, and brother Callum, 12

Zoe said: ‘People used to upset me when they stared at me and called me names. Now I am delighted that I had my operation.

‘I think my new nose looks lovely now. I think my surgeon is very clever. I am very happy now.’

David Dunaway, consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon and head of the craniofacial unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ‘Zoe has been a patient for many years.

David Dunaway, consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon and head of the craniofacial unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said Zoe (pictured with her parents) has 'bravely coped' with her treatment

‘Shortly after birth, she developed a large haemangioma on her nose which caused destruction of part of the nose and ulceration of the skin.

‘Zoe has had extensive treatment for her haemangioma and operations to reconstruct her nose. She has bravely coped with the condition and the treatment needed to reconstruct her nose.

‘Zoe is due to have more surgery in the future.’

A haemangioma is the most common type of birthmark.

It is a benign tumour of the cells which normally line the blood vessels.

In these birthmarks, the cells multiply more rapidly than normal causing a collection of small blood vessels that form lumps in, or under, the skin.

About one in every ten babies has a haemangioma and they are most common in girls and premature babies.

They usually appear when the baby is about two-weeks-old and about 60 per cent develop on the head or neck.

Most do not require any treatment but those near the eye, on the lips, or obstructing the airway do require treatment.

Treatment options include pain relief, beta blockers, laser treatment, steroids and surgery.
