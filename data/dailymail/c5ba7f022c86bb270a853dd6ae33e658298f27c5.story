Most people will have experienced that horrible moment when they realise they've just stepped in dog mess left strewn over the pavement.

Now councils across the country are using a controversial health and safety poster depicting a toddler eating dog waste next to the words 'children will put anything in their mouths' to get owners to clean up their act.

To ram home the message, a second picture of a dog turd is also shown next to a warning for dog owners to pick up their pet's mess or face a £1,000 fine.

Bristol City Council has defended its use of the advert - claiming it has helped to reduce incidents of dog owners failing to clean up after their animals.

Controversial: A posted used by Bristol City Council appears to show a child eating dog mess next to the words 'children will put anything in their mouths'

A spokeswoman said: 'The idea behind the poster is to shock because dog owners not cleaning up after their animals is a shocking thing. Residents have found dog mess, which is very harmful to children, in playgrounds.

'We have several different posters which local councils and resident associations can pick from to use in their areas.

'People were very happy with this poster and the impact it made. We've never received any complaints.'

TV illusionist Derren Brown was one of the first people to bring the unusual poster to light.

Reaction by members of the public has been mixed - with some praising the shocking nature of the picture, while others thought it irresponsible.

James Rhodes, @jrhodespionist, tweeted the council asking: 'What were you thinking?'

Matt Crocker, @mfcrocker, tweeted: 'I really, really don't like this campaign. Pretty embarrassing that it's council run'.

While Richard Littler, @richard_littler, added: Bristol City Council park poster is pretty wrong.'

But Caroline Finucane tweeted: 'Nice. That's one way to get a message across, Bristol City Council.'

Criticism: Many people took to Twitter to complain about the poster and the image of a child eating dog mess

Mixed opinions: But other members of the public loved the poster and commended the council for using it

But other members of the public commended the council for the 'brave' poster - arguing it would encourage dog owners to clean up after their pets.

The poster was first used by Torbay Council in 2009 and was picked up by Bristol City Council for its own campaign in 2011. Other councils around the country have also incorporated the images in to clean-up campaigns.

Speaking back in 2009, local councillor Dave Butt said dog mess on the streets had fallen by more than half from 400 reported incidents in April to 185 in June that year.

He said: 'Dog poo on our streets, parks and beaches looks bad, smells bad, and is offensive to local people and visitors.

'The visual image chosen for our campaign is as disgusting as dog fouling itself and serves as a reminder that only by working together can we take action against offenders.

'The poster was rather unpleasant, but helped drive the message home very forcibly.

'We did not have any complaints, but we did have people ringing us to say it was about time and they were pleased we went in so hard.'
