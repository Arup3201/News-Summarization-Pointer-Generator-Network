Gerard Depardieu shocked an audience at what was meant to be a solemn First World War commemoration by turning up ‘scandalously drunk’

Depardieu was due to read out poetry by the French poet-singer known as Barbara – who survived France’s wartime Holocaust – at the event in Brussels. But he shocked audiences by gesticulating and swearing

Within a few seconds of arriving on stage, Depardieu had ignored much of the prepared text, and was waiving his hands in the air while telling jokes, shouting, and using uncouth language

The solemn words and music recital at the historic Flagey venue was also due to include the work of Depardieu’s late son, Guillaume, who died tragically in 2008.

But within a few seconds of arriving on stage, Depardieu had ignored much of the prepared text, and was waiving his hands in the air while telling jokes, shouting, and using uncouth language.

A translation reveals what he is saying. 

He told the audience: 'I will tell you that I am helping you here, here and elsewhere, and elsewhere

'I see there are people who say aaaaah da da da

'My god what do they know? what do they know about love for Europe?

'I would like... to be strong... I think it can be done... I think it can be done

'Stop Gerard! But I do nothing, I am doing nothing. I am not a politician.

'They are sh**, they are sh**

'I am going to finish with a Flemish poet who is extraordinary.'

Although some members of the audience appreciated the change in tone, and clapped and laughed, others were far from impressed.

'Gerard Depardieu was visibly drunk to say the least,’ one spectator told Brussel’s La Capitale. ‘He started off by finding it difficult to find words of welcome.

‘Then, he read the same sentence once, twice, and then three times! 

Then he left the text that he was reading to digress on to the subject of politics in Belgium.‘Then, a little later, he asked what page he was on.

Audience members said he left the text that he was reading to digress on to the subject of politics in Belgium, then had to ask what page he was on

Finally, the show had to be stopped after half-an-hour, with other audience members tweeting words such as ‘scandalous’ and ‘shame’

He also called for a chair,’ said the spectator, who provided a video of part of the debacle.

In September, Depardieu told an interviewer: ‘I can’t drink like a normal person. 

I can absorb 12, 13, 14 bottles per day. 

'In the morning, it starts at home with champagne or red wine before 10am, then again champagne.'

Depardieu was last year banned from an Air France flight for urinating in the aisle as it prepared to take off, forcing the plane to turn back.

A passenger on the flight said Depardieu appeared to be drunk and insisted he be allowed to use the bathroom during takeoff, when passengers must remain seated.

Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the rich, underwent a quintuple heart bypass operation 14 years ago.

He recently revealed he was once a rent boy, a petty thief who served three weeks in prison for stealing a car and also turned his hand to grave robbing before being saved from destitution by a gay theatre talent spotter who paid for him to study French drama.

The 65-year-old award-winning actor makes his confessions confessions in his autobiography, called 'it happened like that' (Ca c'est fait comme ca) in which he also tells of his unexpected friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president and the death of his son Guillaume in 2008.

Depardieu, who became a household name in Britain for his role in the 1990 romantic comedy Green Card alongside Andie MacDowell, reveals as a toddler he became accustomed to hearing his mother tell him about her attempts to abort him using knitting needles adding: 'And to think I almost killed you.' His family was so poor that as a child he helped deliver his siblings as his parents could not afford a midwife.

Depardieu writes he began to wander the streets when he was just 10 but could easily pass for being 15 - and quickly realised he was attractive to men.

He said: 'I've known since I was very young that I please homosexuals' and added when men approached, asking for sex, 'I would ask them for money'.

He also admits he occasionally helped a man to dig up newly buried bodies in the cemetery and steal jewellery and shoes from them.
