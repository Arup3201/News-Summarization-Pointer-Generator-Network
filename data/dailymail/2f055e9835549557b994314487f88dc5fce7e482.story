A model struggles to go on dates with her own boyfriend because she has a rare illness that causes her to fly into fits of rage when she hears somebody eating.

Faith Watson, 20, from Newmarket, Suffolk, suffers from misophonia - the hatred of sound - meaning she cannot tolerate certain noises.

The slightest chomp or chew can ruin dates with partner of one year, Dave Scott.

Faith Watson, 20, has misophonia - the hatred of sound. This means she flies into an uncontrollable rage at the sound of people chewing and at noises such as a pen tapping

Ms Watson said: ‘Certain noises make me feel like strangling someone and I have different triggers for certain people making it hard to control.

‘If Dave and I go to a restaurant there needs to be music on in the background so I don’t have to think about the noises he or other people are making around me.

‘If we have a night in the TV needs to be on quite loud or I can’t stop glaring at him.’

The condition will also have implications for the couple’s Valentine’s Day plans.

Ms Watson said: ‘This year we will probably just stay in - my misophonia is particularly bad with Dave.

‘This means that the slightest noises he makes can trigger an uncomfortable feeling of anger and the need to remove myself from the situation.

‘But luckily Dave is very supportive and always tries to eat quietly.

‘It’s such a difficult and misunderstood illness for people to understand.’

Ms Watson was forced to drop out of college after suffering years of torment from classroom noises.

Misophonia literally means the hatred of sound.

It is caused by a physical malfunction of the central nervous system or the brain and is an abnormal response to sound.

Most sufferer's find their condition is only triggered by certain sounds.

These can cause strong emotional or physical responses such as rage, crying, screaming or nausea.

The most common triggers are chewing, breathing, throat clearing and sniffing.

There are no cures but some patients find relief through treatments such as hypnosis, cognitive behavioural therapy or meditation.

She said: ‘The class was so quiet that I picked up on every little sound, the tapping of a pen or someone chewing gum would drive me crazy.

‘I would leave college crying every day - I had no choice but to quit.’

Ms Watson’s confidence plummeted as misophonia started to dominate her life and the choices she made where dominated by her condition.

She said: ‘My doctor didn’t know what misophonia was, so I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 18 years old.’

Ms Watson was put on antidepressants because she felt so low and was experiencing crippling anxiety.

Then, when she thought things couldn’t get any worse, her mother, Helen, 52, died suddenly from undiagnosed diverticulitis – a digestive condition of the large intestine.

Ms Watson said: ‘Me and my mum were so close, when I look back at what I’ve been through I’m lucky to have got through it.

‘My mum always said I should have been a model but I never had the confidence to try it.

‘But, before I met Dave I managed to 
self-diagnose myself online with misophonia - with a doctor finally 
confirming it, I have been able to get on with my life.’

Ms Watson was not diagnosed with misophonia until she was 18 but she says she now has the confidence to follow her dream of trying to become a model

Finally, Ms Watson has gained the confidence to fulfil her mother’s wish and her own dreams to become a model.

She has now built up a portfolio and is hoping for a successful career.

Guy Fitzmaurice, Director of Misophonia UK said: ‘Misophonia is a newly-recognised medical condition where the sufferer may develop a hypersensitivity to everyday noises, most commonly other people’s eating and breathing sounds.

‘This can trigger extreme feelings of rage or panic. Sufferers may even imagine doing violence to the maker of the sound.

‘Naturally, this can have a devastating effect on a sufferer’s family or working life.

‘It’s important to remember that everybody experiences misophonia in a different way, but people are often triggered most by those they are closest to.

‘Help is available but sufferers need to seek a referral to a consultant ENT doctor or audiologist who is familiar with the condition. This can be on the NHS.’
