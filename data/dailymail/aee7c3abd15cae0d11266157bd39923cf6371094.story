Thousands of people queued for a rare opportunity to see a unique set of canal locks as they were drained for vital repair work.

The novelty of viewing the steepest locks in Britain from the rare vantage point of the canal bed pulled in over 7,000 people at the weekend.

British Waterways were replacing four of the six giant gates on the famous Five Locks Rise in Bingley, West Yorkshire, in a £200,000 job that takes place every 25 years.

People have been visiting the locks on the Leeds-Liverpool Canal for more than 230 years and this weekend 7,276 had visited by Sunday afternoon, a spokesman said.

He added: 'It’s been a fantastic response, everyone has had an amazing time and it just shows what passion there is out there for the waterways.

'They are the steepest locks in Britain at 60ft from top to bottom.'

A crowd of about 30,000 people turned out to celebrate when the locks were opened in 1774.

Carpenter Russell Clarke, who is responsible for putting in the new lock gates, said: 'The engineering that went into it was amazing. We’re in awe of what went on.

'I think if you asked us to build a lock like this now we would just stand there and scratch our heads.'

Mr Clarke said the lock gates weighed more than five tonnes when installed, adding that the most unusual thing he had found when the locks were drained was a child’s tiara.

'We do find other things like wallets, mobile phones, frying pans, anything that people carry on boats,' he said.

Vince Moran, operations manager at British Waterways, said: 'The winter period from November through to March is what we call the stoppage season.

'That’s when we do most of our maintenance and repair work on the 200-year-old canal system.

'So we’ll be replacing over this winter about two hundred sets of lock gates.'

Visitor Damien O’Keeffe, from Bingley, said he and his five-year-old daughter were impressed with the sheer scale of the locks.

'This was real living history,' he said. 'A chance to really walk in the footsteps of all the navvies and labourers whose sweat and blood built this country,' he said.

'The opportunity to actually walk through the drained locks was too good to miss.'
