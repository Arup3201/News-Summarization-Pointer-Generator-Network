The new Rangers regime have suspended Derek Llambias, Barry Leach and Sandy Easdale from the club’s football board pending an investigation.

The move against the last remnants of the old order at Ibrox came four days after Dave King and his allies swept to power with an emphatic EGM victory.

That shareholder vote saw chief executive Llambias and finance director Leach – associates of Mike Ashley - removed from the PLC board. Sandy Easdale was not a PLC director but had been chairman of the football board. It’s understood all three are no longer welcome to visit Ibrox.

Details of the investigation under way have not been disclosed, but King pledged last Friday to take a thorough look into how the business had previously been run and to examine contracts already in place.

Leach was last month criticised after a disparaging remark about the Three Bears consortium – who made a rival funding offer to Ashley’s £10million loan - appeared in leaked minutes of a meeting with the Rangers Fans Board.

The consortium then called for Leach to ‘become subject to his employers disciplinary processes and ultimately dismissed for gross misconduct’, adding that ‘it is our view that he has brought the club into disrepute’.

A statement from Rangers yesterday confirmed the suspensions and the new make-up of the football board.

‘Rangers Football Club announce today that Derek Llambias, Barry Leach and Sandy Easdale have been suspended from their duties pending an investigation,’ it said.

‘It is also noted that Mr Llambias and Mr Leach, along with Sandy Easdale, have been advised that a resolution to remove them as directors of the Company has been received by the Company. A meeting may be required for this purpose but it is hoped that this will not prove necessary. 

‘Acting Chairman Paul Murray, fellow directors Douglas Park and John Gilligan, and the Club’s Head of Football Administration Andrew Dickson have been appointed to the Board of the Company.’

In response, Easdale’s spokesman insisted they were ‘surprised’ at the announcement, adding: ‘We also note that they talk about an investigation. Sandy Easdale welcomes that as he has absolutely nothing to fear.’

The development came as Rangers beefed up their new-look PLC board, with the appointment of London-based financial businessman John Bennett – once a member of the Blue Knights consortium - and Rangers Supporters Trust spokesman Chris Graham as non-executive directors.

Solicitor James Blair – of Rangers First - has also been announced as company secretary to further recognise the work done by the two main fan ownership groups.

Bennett and Graham join Murray, Gilligan and Park on the PLC board. King has delayed his own appointment but intends to become chairman subject to gaining ‘fit-and-proper’ approval from both the financial authorities and the SFA.

Sandy Easdale’s brother James was previously a PLC director but resigned along with chairman David Somers prior to last week’s EGM.

Llambias and Leach still have executive contracts with Rangers and were viewed by King and his allies as being Ashley’s representatives on the board.

The Newcastle United owner - fined £7,500 by the SFA earlier this month for breaching ‘dual interest’ rules – retains a grip on the Ibrox club’s retail operations via his Sports Direct firm.
