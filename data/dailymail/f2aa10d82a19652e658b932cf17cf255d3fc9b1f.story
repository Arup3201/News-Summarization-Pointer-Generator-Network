Release: Herman Wallace managed to live his final days as a free man

A 71-year-old man who spent 41 years in solitary confinement died today, just days after being freed.

Herman Wallace, who had liver cancer, died at a supporter's home in New Orleans, his attorneys said.

'One of the final things that Herman said to us was, "I am free. I am 
free",' they said.

Before he was released from prison on Tuesday and granted a new trial, Wallace had been at a prison hospital.

Jackie Sumell, a longtime supporter of Wallace, said he was surrounded by friends and family when he died.

At one point Wallace told them, 'I love you all,' she said, adding that he was 'in and out of consciousness'.

Baton Rouge Judge Brian Jackson had ordered Wallace released from prison on Tuesday after granting him a new trial.

Jackson ruled women were unconstitutionally excluded from the grand jury that indicted Wallace in the fatal stabbing of 23-year-old prison guard Brent Miller.

A West Feliciana Parish grand jury re-indicted Wallace on charges connected to Miller's death on Thursday. District Attorney Sam D'Aquilla told The Advocate newspaper that Jackson ordered a new trial because he 'perceived a flaw in the indictment - not his murder conviction'.

Wallace and two other inmates held in solitary confinement for years came to be known as the 'Angola 3'.

When he learned his cancer was terminal, Wallace made a statement on a website dedicated to an art project based around his experiences.

He said: 'The State may have stolen my life, but my spirit will continue to struggle along with Albert and the many comrades that have joined us along the way here in the belly of the beast.'

His attorneys said in a statement on Friday that it was an honor to represent him.

'Herman endured what very few of us can imagine, and he did it with grace, dignity, and empathy to the end,' they said.

'Although
his freedom was much too brief, it meant the world to Herman to spend 
these last three days surrounded by the love of his family and friends.'

Parnell Herbert, who wrote a play about the Angola Three, called his friend a 'phenomenal person' whose mission was to help people.

'He completed that mission. And he was able to see himself a free man,' Mr Herbert told The Times Picayune.Â 

The New Orleans man was serving a 50-year armed robbery sentence when Mr Miller was stabbed to death.

Wallace
and fellow 'Angola 3' member Albert Woodfox denied being involved, 
claiming they were targeted because they helped establish a prison 
chapter of the Black Panther Party at the Angola prison in 1971, where 
they set up demonstrations and organized strikes for better conditions.

In 2010, Woodfox was moved to the David Wade Correctional Center in Homer, where he remains in custody.

The
third 'Angola 3' member, Robert King, who was convicted of killing a 
fellow inmate in 1973, was released in 2001 after his conviction was 
reversed.

'The record in
this case makes clear that Mr Wallace's grand jury was improperly 
chosen in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of "the 
equal protection of the laws" ... and that the Louisiana courts, when 
presented with the opportunity to correct this error, failed to do so,' 
Judge Jackson wrote.

A lawyer for Wallace said the decision gives his client 'some measure of justice after a lifetime of injustice'.

Amnesty International delivered a petition to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's office last year, containing 65,000 signatures from people around the world who called the men's solitary confinement inhuman and degrading.
