From stockpiling extra cash to possibly authorizing advances to customers who rely on federal benefit payments, banks are working out how to help customers cope should the federal budget impasse not be resolved by next week.

Currently partially curtailed, all federal government activities will come to a complete halt in nine days should Democrats and Republicans not come to a budget agreement that includes raising the debt ceiling.

With the government expected to run out of money October 17, many Americans are nervous about what the impact will be to them, and banks are taking steps to make sure customer needs are met.

Working from a playbook: A number of banks are working out contingency plans to help customers should federal benefit payments halt next week as a result of a full government shutdown

An unidentified bank began upping cash reserves at retail branches by at least 20 per cent last week, according to a senior banking executive who spoke to the New York Times.

The extra cash is likely coming from financial institutions such as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley selling government bonds, the Times reported. This action is a strong signal that Wall Street’s faith in Washington is diminishing.

That same bank is also planning to ensure customers’ who rely on payments from Social Security or similar programs will be able to overdraft their accounts without incurring fees, the executive further divulged.

Interest-free cash advances are also being considered in the event benefit payments are delayed, the executive noted.

Endangering the masses: Banks are fielding many concerns from customers and are working to ensure customers are affected as little as possible

Part of what the Financial Times referred to as a ‘playbook,’ the measures were first conceived in 2011 as a government default loomed in the waning days of summer.

Stockpiling cash at retail banking branches is being done should customers decide that stuffing money in mattresses is better than leaving it in accounts no longer insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The FDIC insures up to $250,000 worth of deposits.

Should the borrowing limit not be raised, the U.S. government’s obligations will exceed its ability to pay, forcing the government into a first-ever default.

Let's make a deal: President Barack Obama signaled a willingness to make concessions during a Tuesday news conference

Most experts agree that a breach of the debt ceiling would lead to grave consequences, including a freeze in credit, severe drops in securities markets, and a global economic downturn as bad – if not worse - as 2008’s Great Recession.

Failure to raise the debt ceiling would lead to a ‘very, very severe recession with no obvious way out,” Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi told the Wall Street Journal.

‘Not only might the economic consequences of default be profound,’ the Treasury Department wrote last week in a report, ‘those consequences, including high interest rates, reduced investment, higher debt payments, and slow economic growth, could last for more than a generation.’

Despite these dire predictions, some in Congress are taking a laissez-faire approach to resolving the issue.

Louisiana Republican John Fleming has compared economists to weather forecasters.

'Economists, what have they been doing? They make all sorts of predictions,' Mr Fleming said. 'Many times they’re wrong, so I don’t think we should run government based on economists’ predictions.'

Florida Republican Ted Yoho said global financial markets would stabilize, should a default occur.

President Barack Obama, in remarks Tuesday from the White House, signalled a willingness to compromise, admitting he’d be open to a short-term budget while a longer-term solution is worked out.

‘We recognize,' Mr Obama conceded, 'that there are going to have to be some compromises between the Democratic position and the Republican position.’

The government has nine days to avoid a potential economic calamity, but the nation’s banks are not standing idly by during another looming default.
