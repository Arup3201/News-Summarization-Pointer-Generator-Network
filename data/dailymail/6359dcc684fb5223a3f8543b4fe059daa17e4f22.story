Sergio Aguero has stepped up his rehabilitation after suffering knee ligament damage against Everton at the beginning of December.

Aguero lasted just three minutes of Manchester City's 1-0 defeat of Everton after a challenge with Muhamed Besic at the Etihad.

The injury was a cruel blow for the Argentine who has scored 19 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Manuel Pellegrini's side this season.

The Manchester City striker left the field in tears after suffering the injury just three minutes into the game 

The City striker stated on his Twitter account: 'I wanted you to know I've already started field work. Slowly but surely I'll be back at the right moment. Thanks for the wishes!'

City have coped well without their star striker, having gone undefeated since the forward's injury, and are currently level on points with Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea.

Pellegrini's men travel to Goodison Park to face the Toffees in a crucial league meeting on Saturday as they look to keep up the pressure on the Jose Mourinho's men at the top of the standings.

Aguero has been in sparkling form this season scoring 19 goals in 21 appearances for his club
