Embarrassed: Gregg Wrigley, 28, has lost 12 stone through dieting and exercise - but the folds of skin left behind are making him miserable

A determined chef who shed almost half his bodyweight after reaching 27 stone is now begging the NHS for an operation to remove his excess skin.

Gregg Wrigley, from Bolton in Greater Manchester, lost 12 stone through dieting and exercise, and says the health service's refusal to help with the final step is making him miserable.

'If I’d had gastric band surgery it 
would have cost the NHS several thousands of pounds but I’ve lost the 
weight myself and that hasn’t cost them a penny,' said the 28-year-old.

He said he had 'always being quite big' and had started piling on the pounds
 while a pupil at Canon Slade School.

After leaving school, he put on even more weight until he reached a hefty 27 stone.

Mr Wrigley, a head chef at an old 
people’s home in Bury, said: 'The last thing I wanted to do when I got 
home was to cook, so I’d get takeaways.

'People used to refer to me as Big Gregg.'

His sister, 28-year-old Rebecca Stone, persuaded him to lose weight when her first daughter, 
Stephanie, now aged three, was born.

'She said she wanted Stephanie to have an uncle and she feared I wouldn’t be around much longer if I continued the way I was,'

Mr Wrigley totally changed his lifestyle - taking up exercise, cutting down on alcohol, eating healthily and joining WeightWatchers.

If he had been given a gastric band, available on the NHS, it could have cost the taxpayer up to £7,000.

Three years later, he weighs just over 
15 stone, but is unhappy with the extra skin that is left on his 
stomach, arms and thighs, which he estimates weighs one-and-a-half 
stone.

'The skin is hideous and makes me feel dreadful,' he said. 'I have no confidence and feel really upset when I look at myself.'

Desperate: Mr Wrigley (left, holding bottle) cannot afford to have the operation on his skin privately

Mr Wrigley believes he was refused 
because the surgery is classed as cosmetic and therefore not a priority.
 'It seems so unfair when it is making me so miserable,' he added.

The operation is not available on the NHS where he lives, and he cannot afford private care.

'Swimming is the very best exercise, yet there is no way I can go swimming when I look like this,' he said.

He is awaiting vital surgery on a damaged knee, but cannot have that operation until his weight is under 15 stone.

An NHS Bolton spokesman said: 'We have a
 policy over what surgeries can be routinely funded by the NHS and this 
type of surgery is not.'

He added that Mr Wrigley had a right to appeal.
