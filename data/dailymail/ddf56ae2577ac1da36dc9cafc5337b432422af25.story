Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James has called for shorter seasons in the NBA to reduce the risk of serious injury.

The NBA are experimenting with shorter quarters - reducing their duration from 12 minutes to 11 minutes - following claims that players are being over-played.

But James believes that is not the solution, with the American calling for fewer games, rather than shorter games, to resolve the issue.

'Less games is less concessions and less tickets and all that, but at the end of the day we want to protect the prize, and the prize is the players,' James told Akron Beacon Journal. 'If guys are being injured because there’s so many games, we can’t promote it at a high level.'

He added: 'The minutes don’t mean anything. We could play 50-minute games if we had to. Once you go out and play on the floor it doesn’t matter if you’re playing 22 minutes or 40 minutes. Once you play it takes a toll on your body.'

But Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan disagreed with James, suggesting that basketball players face fewer risks to health than American football players, who have been campaigning heavily against the long-term negative impacts of playing professional sport.

'I loved playing,' Jordan, who now owns the Charlotte Hornets, told ESPN. 'If I wasn't playing 82 games, I still would've been playing somewhere else because that's the love for the game I had. As a player, I never thought 82 games was an issue.

'But if that's what they want to do, we as owners and players can evaluate it and talk about it. But we'd make less money as partners. Are they ready to give up money to play fewer games? That's the question, because you can't make the same amount of money playing fewer games.

'It's not like football. We don't really have to worry about concussions and some of the physical damage that football players deal with after they retire.'
