A publishing giant is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend in the middle of New York restaurants on two different occasions.

Amazon publishing head Laurence Kirshbaum, 69, is being sued by Teresa McCoy, 55, for unspecified damages after she claims he assaulted her when she came to him about a job.

He denies all allegations against him.

In papers filed on Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court, McCoy said she'd had a personal relationship with the married Kirshbaum in the early 2000s when he was the head of the Time Warner Book Group. 

They parted ways in 2005 but reconnected again in 2010.

Kirshbaum contacted her about a job he thought would be suited to her, the suit alleges, and the two met in a Manhattan deli to discuss it.

Suit: In papers filed in Manhattan 
Supreme Court, Teresa McCoy said she'd had a personal relationship with the 
Kirshbaum in the early 2000s and though they parted ways in 
2005, they reconnected again in 2010

While she was looking at the salad counter, he allegedly attacked her.

'The much physically larger Kirshbaum suddenly swooped down, grabbed her and forcibly stuck his tongue in her mouth, causing (her) neck to jerk back in excruciating pain', the suit states.

He then 'thrust a hand into her pants and panties' and groped her, the suit says. When she pushed him off he 'apologized profusely', only to stick his tongue in her mouth again, according to the suit.

He also allegedly told her she would always be the love of his life and that he wanted to leave his wife for her, the New York Post reports.

About two months later, they met again in a coffee bar when he told her he wanted to give her money for a documentary she was working on.

When they were there he shoved his hand up her skirt, according to the suit, and when she pushed him off said, 'I'm not done yet'.

'I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I have to,' he allegedly said before putting his head in her crotch and performing oral sex on her in the restaurant.

When he stood back up, he jammed his tongue down her throat again and twisted her nipple, the suit claims.

McCoy never filed a complaint with police, according to the New York Daily News.

The suit seeks money damages for 'psychological and emotional injuries' stemming from Rape Trauma Syndrome from the sexual attack.

The 69-year-old signed an agreement in 2005 promising that he would only have professional contact with her in the future, according to the New York Post, but he denies any sexual assault.

Kirshbaum’s attorney Catherine Redlich,
admitted her client had a consensual relationship with McCoy ten 
years ago, but called the assault allegations 'baseless' saying they stemmed from a consensual relationship turned sour.
