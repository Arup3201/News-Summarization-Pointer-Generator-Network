Swansea City manager Garry Monk plans to appeal the red card given to goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski during their 3-1 defeat against West Ham on Sunday.

Fabianski was sent off for impeding Diafra Sakho outside of the penalty box and denying the Senegal international a clear goalscoring opportunity in the 68th minute.

Replays showed Sakho appeared to handle the ball as he ran beyond Fabianski but the West Ham striker was knocked off balance by the Swansea goalkeeper in doing so.

Sakho kept his footing as Chris Foy played the advantage but the 24-year-old could only hit the post, leading the referee to call it back for a free-kick and produce red for Fabianski. 

'Look at the build up (to the red card),' Monk said after the defeat at Upton Park. 'He knocks the ball past with his hand. 

'Ashley had made a mistake in the build up, but it should be a handball to us. It wasn't a clear goal scoring opportunity either.'

Asked if he will appeal the decision, Monk continued: 'You would think so. The cold-hearted fact is it should be handball and free-kick to us.'

The defeat left Swansea sitting eighth and West Ham in third in the Barclays Premier League.
