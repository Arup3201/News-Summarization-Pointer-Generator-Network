With his fighting career apparently on the ropes, bad boy boxer Adrien Broner prefers to focus his energies these days on getting paid just to show up and party at nightclubs across the country.

The Cincinnati-born 24-year-old has held three title belts during his career, but is currently more interested in making lucrative personal appearances than training for his next fight.

According to Broner’s advisers, their star man is pulling in between $6,000 and $10,000 an appearance. Recent appearances including spending Halloween at The Bank in Cleveland and an appearance at a strip club in Queens, New York.

In the club: Broner is pulling in between $6,000 and $10,000 an appearance and is booked up every single weekend now through until the end of the year

Broner is a busy man and is booked up every single weekend now through until the end of the year, although TMZ reports that he is available to the highest bidder for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

As well as his nightclub performances, Boner has also diversified into other entertainment avenues including an online reality show about him and his crew Band Camp called About Billions.

The boxing champ also fancies himself as a rapper and released a hip hop track earlier this year called Never Had It which was a paean to his tough upbringing and desire to never return to it.

Like his idol, Floyd Mayweather, Broner isn’t shy about flaunting his wealth and his Instagram account includes countless images of the 5ft 7in boxer with large bags of money and expensive jewelry.

Broner and his 'big brother' Floyd Mayweather: In the past the pair have been happy to talk up their friendship

In the past, Broner and Mayweather have been happy to talk up their friendship.

Broner has referred to Mayweather as his ‘big brother,’ and the 37-year-old – widely regarded as one of the greatest ever boxers - has tried to advise the young pretender on how to successfully rise through the weight divisions.

Broner lost his WBA Welterweight title last December when he was defeated by Marcos Maidana and afterward Mayweather explained that he’d tried to help his young apprentice.

‘I tried to tell him about certain moves he needs to make in certain fights. And then he asks me a question and I'm telling him or I'm teaching him different moves - he says "naw big brother, I got it, I got it,"' said Mayweather 

'And I said, "Listen to me, it's different at this level. The way that you're shining on D-level fighters and C-level fighters, you're not going to be able to do that to A and B-level fighters.'"

Broner bounced back from that defeat to beat his next opponent Carlos Molina in May, although it wasn’t without incident.

Broner managed to get himself suspended over a racist slur against his opponent when he shouted 'I just beat the f*** out of a Mexican,' after his 10-round win.

Soon afterwards he attempted to boost his poor public image when he was filmed handing $1,000 to a homeless man.

Since then the boxing bad boy has consistently made the headlines for all the wrong reasons including for refusing to leave a tip on a $24 check and instead wrote 'Or Nah.'

Earlier this month he posted a video entitled Adrien Broner Death Speech in which he revealed that when he gets to heaven he plans to smack Michael Jackson 'because he was black and he wanted to be white.'

Broner is due back in training in December although it hasn’t been announced who his next fight is against, until then he continues with his tour of personal appearances at nightclubs around the country.
