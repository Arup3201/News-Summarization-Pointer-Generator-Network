True price: The cost of the cup, stirrer and lid on a medium takeaway coffee adds up to 16p

If you crave a cappuccino in the morning or buy a latte with lunch, you might need a double espresso after reading this.

The most expensive ingredient in your takeaway coffee is not the beans flown in from South America – it’s the cup.

The packaging used by High Street chains costs twice as much as the beans they use, according to a study.

With demand for coffee higher than ever, researchers analysed the production costs of a cappuccino at the most popular coffee shops to establish whether customers are getting value for money.

They found that the cost of the coffee served in a medium-sized £2.20 cappuccino amounts to  a mere 8p. But the packaging and extras – including the cup, lid,  stirrer, napkin and sugar – cost 16p to produce.

Staff wages make up the biggest portion of the drink’s total price, with nearly a quarter of the £2.20 used to pay baristas.

The Government receives the second-largest share, taking an average of 37p from each drink in VAT.

The cappuccino chosen by researchers as a sample drink is typically made up of one-third coffee, one-third hot milk and one-third frothed milk.

Retail analyst Allegra Strategies, which conducted the study, found that the milk used typically costs 8p. Another 15 per cent of the total price is used to pay for rent and associated costs such as business rates, with a further 15 per cent going towards administration.

After all these payments are deducted, the coffee shops are left with around 13 per cent of the price paid for the drink as profit.

Researchers also found that the price of a cappuccino at Britain’s biggest coffee chains has increased dramatically in the past decade.

Only ten years ago it would have cost £1.30. But they denied that customers are being ripped off, saying that paying a higher price for a coffee is now commonplace because the drink is has become part of the British ‘social experience’.

Jeffrey Young, of Allegra Strategies, said: ‘I think customers are getting extremely good value.

Findings: As well as a breakdown of costs of a takeaway coffee, researchers also found that the price of a cappuccino on Britain's high street has increased dramatically in the past 10 years

‘The time that consumers spend in coffee shops is generally time well spent for them.

‘Coffee is now a very big part of the social experience of British society.

‘People spend a lot of time there [in coffee shops] and they aren’t paying for that time other than the price of a cup of coffee.’

He added: ‘Sometimes two or three people can get together and spend a few hours and can collectively spend a fiver. That’s extremely good value.’
