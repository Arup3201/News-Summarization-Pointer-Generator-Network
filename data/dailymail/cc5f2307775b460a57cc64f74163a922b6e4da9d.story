Emotional meeting: Matt Heisler's sister Casey gets to hear her dead brother's heart beat in the chest of Vietnam vet Tom Meeks

Matt Heisler was just 21 when he passed away in a house fire at the University of North Dakota in March

Meeks, from Washington state, had been diagnosed with a rare disease called amyloidosis in 2011.

Doctors said he wouldn't survive without a transplant. 

Due to his age, Meeks had already been rejected for a transplant by five hospitals before the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, carried out the successful transplant last month.

Then last week - some eight months after Matt’s death - his parents and younger sister, Casey, were able to meet Meeks and listen to Matt's heart beating in his chest.

It was an extremely emotional encounter for everyone involved. 

‘We're very proud of Matt,’ his father Jared Heisler told KARE 11.

‘Obviously, in my case, [the Heislers] are always going to carry a warm spot in my heart,’ said Meeks. 

Matt's organ donation helped more than 60 people including two women received Matt’s kidneys, while a 61-year-old man’s life was saved by Matt’s liver.

‘He made the decision that if life ever slipped away from him, he would give life to someone else,' said his father.
