STRANGER THAN FICTION: THE LIFE OF EDGAR WALLACE

by Neil Clark

(The History Press £17.99)

Fleet Street has always produced — and attracted — spectacular characters. None was more spectacular, in his day, than Edgar Wallace.

He was simply the most prolific and successful popular journalist-novelist of the start of the 20th century — as much of a household name as any filmstar, politician or writer; as recognisable as Lloyd George or Churchill, Conan Doyle or Somerset Maugham.

I grew up avidly reading his adventure stories about the rulers of the British Empire, such as Sanders Of The River, and mysteries, such as The Four Just Men. Cascades of thrillers poured from him, as well as many hit West End plays.

British crime writer, Edgar Wallace was the most prolific and successful popular journalist-novelist of the start of the 20th century

You couldn’t keep up with him. He was also one of the sights of the West End, where his yellow Rolls-Royce was instantly recognised. He liked to keep it and his chauffeur waiting outside his hotel or club, in case he should suddenly want to go racing — which he did a great deal.

To me, he was a legend of early Fleet Street, especially of Northcliffe’s Daily Mail. Like many hopeful young journalists, I stood in Ludgate Circus, where Fleet Street begins, looking at his profile set in a wall plaque and reading the inscription: ‘Of his talents he gave lavishly to authorship — but to Fleet Street he gave his heart’.

What makes this so poignant is that it is set above the spot where Wallace stood aged 11 in 1886, selling a newspaper called The Echo, which brought in his only income of three shillings a week.

An orphan, he was given away as a baby by his touring actress mother and raised by a Billingsgate fish porter and his family as foster parents. He was fated, obviously, to be a labourer all his life.

His escape into the playgrounds of the gilded rich he owed entirely to his pen, his fecund imagination and his insatiable appetite for work. He had huge talent, but hardly any writer, except perhaps Simenon, has turned out books as quickly and as successfully as Wallace did.

Staggering statistics abound in this story. Let’s settle for a few: in four years of the Twenties, Wallace published 74 books — equivalent to one title almost every three weeks. It was claimed that a quarter of new books sold in Britain in those years were by him. In 1965, more than 30 years after his death, his worldwide sales were claimed to top 50 million in 28 languages.

Ah, but he is little known to younger generations today. So were they so much trash, mere Penny Dreadfuls? They can’t have been.

The thriller, like the detective story, was then the new fashion, and Wallace combined the appeal of both. Many of his stories revolved around the unmasking of a Moriarty-like villain concealed among the leading characters. ‘Can you guess which?’ was a game he played with his readers.

Unlike the stuffy, upper-middle-class settings and characters of Agatha Christie or Dorothy Sayers, his lower-class or classless characters are convincing. He was one of them.

His criminal gangs, locked- room murder mysteries, multiple disguises and chases were always inventive and sensational. ‘You can’t fail to be thrilled by Edgar Wallace,’ promised the blurb.

Those who were thrilled included the highest in the land. Queen Mary bought four to read to a sickly George V (admittedly not known as an intellectual).

Prime Ministers Baldwin and Balfour were fans, and the famous barrister F. E. Smith, Lord Birkenhead, said he had never failed to be excited by a Wallace Story. P. G. Wodehouse complained he couldn’t find anything new to read until the next Wallace appeared.

Dozens of his stories have since been filmed and televised. He himself wrote and sometimes directed his own films. He was script-writing in Hollywood when he died unexpectedly in 1932 of pneumonia, possibly aggravated by his years of chain-smoking through a long cigarette holder, which was his trademark.

The long catalogue of his successes cannot help but become repetitive in Clark’s workman-like chronicle. The most interesting passages describe how Wallace fought his way out of poverty and into journalism. His very name was fiction. The name ‘Wallace’ was made up — it was claimed to be that of his father when his birth was registered by his mother, the touring actress Polly Richards.

His actual father was the son of her company manager, who was about to marry someone else. She didn’t care to embarrass him. The boy (and later the man) was known by his first name, Richard or Dick. ‘Edgar’ was the surname of his real father and ‘Wallace’ never existed.

Leaving school at 12, which was then the rule, he kept changing one menial job for another until, in desperation, he joined the army at Woolwich. Soon, he was sent to South Africa for the start of the Boer War as a medical orderly.

He had been writing verses for local magazines in Cape Town when Rudyard Kipling was to pay a visit. His welcoming verse in Kipling’s style appeared on the front page of the Cape Times.

Kipling was tickled by it and invited him to dinner. So a working-class private soldier-poet hobnobbed with Britain’s most famous author.

This got him known. He contributed verse to other papers, became a local columnist, then a war correspondent for Reuters news agency, covering the British forces fighting the Boers. These reports were picked up by the new Daily Mail, first published in 1896. The Mail made him its own correspondent.

Wallace’s ingenuity in getting round the fierce censorship of news gave the Mail several scoops, including the long-awaited peace declaration.

Alfred Harmsworth, the future Lord Northcliffe, welcomed his young reporter back to England with a celebration dinner. Wallace became the Mail’s top reporter — until he was fired by Northcliffe for having trusted a false tip about a mutiny that never was.

By then, he was addicted to horse-racing. He became a racing writer and tipster for several papers. His adventure stories were beginning to sell. The money was coming in. So, he took the plunge as an author.

Deciding that his typing took too long, he began to dictate his stories to a trusted typist, direct to the page. He reached the point where he could start dictating at midnight on a Friday and have a 75,000 book complete in typescript by the following Monday.

O ne of the jokes triggered by his productivity was of a man who asked for him on the telephone and was told, ‘Mr Wallace is writing a book.’ ‘Fine,’ said the caller, ‘I’ll hold on.’

He earned plenty of money, but spent it as fast as it came in. Men who begin life in great poverty often hang onto their wealth. He loved spending it — not just on himself, but on others.

For Royal Ascot week, he took a box with its own restaurant and invited dozens of friends to enjoy the racing with him. He would tell them he had put £10 on the last race for each of them. Whichever horse won, he would claim this had been the one they had backed — and he paid out all his guests, often out of his own pocket.

In the course of this overworked life, he acquired two wives, sometimes living amicably with both in a ménage-a-trois. When he died, his debts far outweighed his bank account. Everything — houses, racehorses, motor cars — had to be sold.

A year later, the motion picture he had been working on in Hollywood appeared. It was King Kong — billed as ‘Edgar Wallace’s Last Story’. In fact, the script he wrote was mostly unused and the ideas were partly his and partly those of a co-writer called Merian Cooper.

However, it was all his idea that King Kong climbed the Empire State Building — which is what everyone remembers.
