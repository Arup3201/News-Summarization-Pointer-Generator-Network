Nigel Pearson has refused to apologise to a Leicester City supporter despite footage having emerged of him appearing to tell the fan to 'f*** off and die'.

The Foxes boss admitted he regretted the incident but says he sees 'no need to apologise to someone of that ilk'.

Footage emerged on Friday of the Leicester manager's spat with a supporter during the 3-1 defeat against Liverpool - an incident which has led the club to launch an internal investigation.

Pearson was speaking at his press conference ahead of Leicester's match away to Aston Villa on Sunday

But in his press conference ahead of Leicester's match away to Aston Villa on Sunday, Pearson said: 'I’ve had run-ins with fans in the past and in the heat of the moment these things happen.

'I’m not going to repeat what happened on either side. I’m very keen to protect my self and my players. I’m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation.

'If people were offended then that is regrettable. But there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk.

'The perennial moaners are, I’m afraid, there at most football clubs. There is a situation where people revel in bad news. You get those people from time to time.'

Pearson was asked if he would respond in the same manner in future if he was subjected to such abuse, and he admitted he 'hoped not'.

He also insisted that he was well within his rights to protect his players and himself from outside abuse - and branded criticism of the club's owners as 'disgraceful'.

He added: 'I hope not. But I’ve had no run-ins with the fans. I’m prepared to stick up both for myself and the players.

'I thought Tuesday’s performance was very good in lots of ways. The vast majority of supporters can see that.

'I spoke to Susan Whelan our chief executive after the game, she unfortunately had to deal with box owners giving abuse to our owners.

'I feel it incredible anybody could question the integrity of our owners. That's nothing short of disgraceful.'

And Pearson even believes some good has come from the exchange with the supporter - explaining the Leicester squad have been 'galvanised' by the incident.

'It’s good for us because it’s galvanised the feeling within the camp,' he said.

'The players are exceptionally unhappy with one or two things that went on.

'These things are regrettable but they will happen from time to time.

'I’m not saying they can’t criticise but they can't then bleat if they get a taste of their own medicine.'

In the immediate aftermath of the defeat by Liverpool, Pearson admitted to a ‘spat’, saying: ‘I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn’t like what he sees, then don’t bother coming.’ 

He then added: ‘Maybe they ought to think about staying at home. We’ve worked hard and will continue to do so. I don’t like the commitment of my players being questioned.’

Pearson was already under severe pressure before the footage emerged due to the fact Leicester sit bottom of the Premier League.

They have failed to win any of their last nine matches and are in an extremely difficult position heading into the game against Villa.
