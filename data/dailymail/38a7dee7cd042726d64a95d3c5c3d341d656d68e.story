Life in prison: Gregory Scott Hale was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for a gruesome murder 

A Tennessee man who told police he ate part of his victim's body has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after pleading guilty in the woman's death.

Coffee Circuit Judge Craig Johnson sentenced 37-year-old Gregory Scott Hale of Summitville on Thursday.

The Tullahoma News said Hale pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the June 8 death of 36-year-old Lisa Marie Hyder.

Prosecutors say Hale picked Hyder up at a liquor store and took her to his residence, killing her after sex.

They say he told investigators that he was fulfilling an obsession. He also admitted to eating a part of the victim.

'He told investigators that he fulfilled an obsession in wanting to kill a person and dismembering them,' Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott told Circuit Court Judge Craig Johnson Thursday.

Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott said officers discovered a burned torso with hands, feet and head cut off and found in buckets.

Hale's attorney, Kevin Askren, didn't immediately return a call.

Hyder’s former husband Charles Hyder said he and his children 'forgave Hale' for killing her then dismembering her.

Hyder told The Tullahoma News that he was happy with the plea agreement.

'Lisa and I were married for six years and had two children, a 4-year old and a 6-year old,' Hyder said.

'The children are too young to understand what has happened so I just told them that mama got sick and she has gone to live with God.'

Hyder's father Billy Poore told the court that he could not forgive hale 'at this time.'

'I will never have her back,' Poore said.

'May God have mercy on him.'

Poore said that one of his younger daughters is haunted by her eldest sister's death and is having terrible nightmares.

She has two sisters and a brother who live in Ohio and they have to try and cope with not having her with them anymore.

'He is an animal and needs to be put away and never get out,' Poore said. 

'I cannot forgive him.'

According to Lisa Hyder's ex-husband this summer, Charles Hyder, the mother of their six children had struggled with alcoholism and was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, WZTV reported.

The woman lived in a Chattanooga suburb and worked in a store selling spirits in Manchester, where on Friday afternoon she ran into Gregory Hale.

At around 2.30pm, she called her ex-husband asking to pick her up, but he said he was in another town. He told her to wait for him, but when Mr Hyder returned home two hours later and called Lisa back, her phone was not answering.

Charles Hyder said he spent the weekend trying to reach his ex-wife so their children, the youngest of them just a year old, could talk to her like they did every day, but he could not get a hold of her.

‘I still blame myself because I didn't go get her, but I was down in Huntsville unloading my truck, and I wished I could have been there a little bit faster,’ Hyder said. ‘Usually I rescue her every time something goes wrong.’ 

‘My daughter was mangled, butchered and chopped up like a liver. There's nothing left,’ her heartbroken father, Billy Poore, told the station WAAY.

A clearer picture also has begun to emerge of the suspected killer and cannibal, Gregory Hale.

The 37-year-old was known among his neighbors and acquaintances as a devil worshiper.

He was reportedly fired from a meat processing plant after the owner caught him performing a satanic ritual.

The proprietor of the slaughterhouse recalled that Hale would often take animal bones and eyeballs home with him.

His Facebook page is filled with disturbing, sexually explicit and grisly images, as well as references to cannibalism and Scandinavian mythology.

Changing looks: In one photo Hale apperas to be a gentleman but his style changed throughout his life 

'Would tha vegetarian taste like that fake soy meat like they got in sum fast food places???' he wrote in April.

According to his social media account, the 37-year-old has a girlfriend and a teenage son named after a Norse god.

Some of Hale's selfies depict him brandishing weapons, including a large steel machete, or cradling snakes.

The 37-year-old also shared an image that featured a line of text that read: 'I hug the people I hate so I know how big to dig their hole in my backyard.'

Coffee County District Attorney Mickey Layne said Hale was apprehended at his home late Sunday after a neighbor told police he'd had a conversation with the 37-year-old and had reason to believe a homicide had been committed.

When officers arrived at the home, Layne said they found human remains on the grounds. They then questioned Hale and took him into custody.

Hale has an attorney and is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. His next court date is June 23.

Detectives believe the gruesome murder took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Manchester Friday.

According to Hale's arrest affidavit, the suspect admitted to killing Lisa Hyder and then disposing of her body by beheading the victim and chopping off her hands and feet. 

 Officers who responded to Hale's residence after receiving a tip found at least two plastic buckets filled with human remains.

Hale buried the victim's torso in a burn pile on his property and consumed a part of the corpse, the document stated.

Following his arrest, Hale told police he and Hyder did not know each other until they met in Manchester and went to the man's home, Times Free Press reported.

The two were sitting around the fire and talking when the 37-year-old allegedly attacked and killed Hyder.

Gregory Hale offered investigators no motive for the brutal slaying and subsequent cannibalism.
