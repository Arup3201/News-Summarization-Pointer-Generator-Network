The nuclear deterrent base in Scotland would be designated as sovereign United Kingdom territory under plans drawn up by the Ministry of Defence.

The move comes amid warnings of the ‘enormous’ costs of trying to relocate the Trident missile system away from Faslane if Scotland breaks away from the rest of the UK.

But David Cameron today moved to quash the idea, warning it was not a ‘credible or sensible’.

The future of Britain’s nuclear deterrent has become a key area of dispute in the run up to the referendum on Scottish independence next year.

The submarines and missiles are housed at a naval base on the Clyde but the SNP wants rid of the system.

Officials in Whitehall have been looking at alternatives to ensure Britain can maintain its at sea deterrent.

Under the plan to reclassify Faslane, the base would be given the same status as the British sovereign military bases in Cyprus, the Guardian reported.

A defence source said: ‘It would cost a huge amount of money, running into tens of billions of pounds, to decommission Faslane.

Warning: Downing Street made clear that David Cameron did not think the plan was sensible

‘Those costs would be factored into any negotiations on an independence settlement. The sovereign base area is an option. It is an interesting idea because the costs of moving out of Faslane are eye-wateringly high.’

The government has always officially insisted it is not working on alternative options for siting Trident because it expects Scots to vote to stay in the UK.

Earlier this month Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned that moving the base for the continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent would ‘cost a significant amount of money’.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘No contingency plans are being made to move Trident out of Scotland. The scale and cost of any potential relocation away from Faslane would be enormous.’

However, Downing Street today insisted Mr Cameron would not support proposals to designate the Clydeside home of the Trident nuclear deterrent as sovereign United Kingdom territory.

A Number 10 spokesman said that no such idea had been presented to Mr Cameron or to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, adding that it would not be a "credible or sensible" course of action.

Scottish National Party defence spokesman Angus Robertson described the sovereign territory idea as ‘an extraordinary attempt by Westminster to bully Scotland’.

Mr Robertson added: ‘Neither the people nor Parliament of Scotland want nuclear weapons dumped here, and we are clear that Trident would have to be removed as quickly as possible - only a Yes vote next September will empower Scotland to get rid of Trident, and the money saved will help build a fairer society and stronger economy.

‘A key argument for independence is that Scotland will no longer have to pay for nuclear weapons that we do not want. A No vote, by contrast, means a new generation of nuclear weapons on the Clyde for another 50 years.’
