Australian businessman Peter Gerald Scully is 'remorseful' after being arrested in the Philippines for his role in a sickening international paedophile ring which has shocked the country and renewed calls to re-introduce the death penalty.

Scully has been accused of running a child pornography business, charging fellow predators to watch children perform disgusting acts - but is promising to reveal all in the hope of getting a lighter sentence.

The heinous business included live-streaming the sexual abuse of babies and children to clients in numerous countries, including Australia, according to The Age.

Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators.

'I will make a very in-depth ... not just comment, but report. That's how remorseful I am.'

Scully reportedly made similar comments since his transfer from Manila to a jail in Cagayan de Oro, where his alleged paedophile ring was based. Clients reportedly paid the between $US100 and $US10,000 to watch videos, some of which have been described as the most shocking seen by Filipino agents fighting human trafficking.

One alleged video titled 'The Destruction of Daisyby' was uploaded to an online porn website, and reportedly shows sex acts and torture being carried out.

Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon.

Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show one the victims, a 13-year-old girl, being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five. 

'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. 

Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. 

Janet Francisco, head of the anti-human trafficking division of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation, said that two people had been charged overseas in relation to the investigation.

They are believed to be of European nationality, reported The ABC. 

The Australian Embassy reportedly met to convene on the case, and the UNICEF's chief of child protection in the Philippines, Sarah Norton Staal, said the case needed urgent attention.

'Well obviously the Australians don't want to see any perpetrators, any Australian nationals who are involved in this,' Ms Staal said.

'And even if there's one, you know, one is too many.' 

It is claimed the father of two abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers for his 'pay for view' online child pornography business.

Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.

He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. 

Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history.

An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, said he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully.

'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age.

'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' 

The alleged crimes are so horrific and sparked such wide-spread outrage across the Philippines it has led to calls to reintroduce the death penalty.

The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death.

'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.  

An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. 

Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 

Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house.

Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.   

The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task.

It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.
