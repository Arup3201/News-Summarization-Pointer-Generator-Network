A Navy SEAL who was shot 27 times and still managed to pull out his handgun and kill two enemy fighters is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans. 

Mike Day is representing Dallas-based Carrick Brain Centers, where he was treated for PTSD eight years after he survived a gunfight while serving in Iraq.

In 2007 Day was hit 27 times by enemy fire after he was the first of his SEAL team to enter a room where four enemy fighters were waiting and quickly shot the rifle out of his hand.

Former Navy SEAL Mike Day, who was shot 27 times during a gunfight in Iraq, is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans 

During the attack 11 shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him. He was shot in both legs as arms, the buttocks and scrotum, as well as his abdomen. His thumb almost had to be amputated 

Day managed to kill two enemy fighters with his pistol before he was knocked unconscious by a grenade that exploded less than 10-feet away from him. 

Eleven shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him, according to WTKR.  

When Day woke up a minute later in the midst of a firefight, he grabbed his handgun and shot down two enemy fighters before the gunfire ceased. 

The tough SEAL then got up and walked himself to the medical helicopter. 

Day described the extent of his numerous injuries on his half-Ironman fundraiser page, writing that he was shot in both legs and arms, as well as the buttocks and scrotum. 

He said a shot to his abdomen also left him with a colostomy bag for a year, and his left thumb was almost amputated.  

Day said now his life's mission is to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters' 

Day's ribs were also fractured and he suffered contusions to his lungs after his body armor was hit so many times, but the bullets missed all his vital organs. 

'This was a single gunfight at an ordinary day at the office,' he wrote on the page. 

After spending 16 days in the hospital, where he lost 55 pounds, Day was discharged and awarded the Purple Heart. 

Day, who has spent 20 years in the SEALS, has also won the Silver and Bronze Star.

But Day said his life's mission is not about him but to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters'. 

Day has raised $68,585 of his $75,000 goal for the center, which specializes in working with wounded warriors as well as children with severe brain injuries. 

He will run participate in the half-Ironman, a 70 mile triathlon, in Florida next month.
