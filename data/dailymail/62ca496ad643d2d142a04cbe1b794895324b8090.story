Hundreds of gypsy mourners took to the streets of Wales today to pay tribute to a man who died after being in a coma for the last 22 years.

Andrew Colwyn - known as 'the boy' - was 24 when he was hit by a drunk driver in 1992, leaving him bedridden and unable to communicate with family or friends.

In true big fat gypsy style, his funeral procession today was lead by a horse and carriage, and followed by five trucks full of flower displays including pints of beer, security vans, and a pack of cigarettes.

Other displays gracing the streets of Splott, Cardiff, were boxers and Ford pick-up vans, celebrating his love of cars and amateur boxing.

Dozens of gypsies took to the streets of Wales today to mourn the death of Andrew Colwyn, known as 'The Boy', who spent the last 22 years in a coma after being hit by a drunk driver in 1992

Among the more bizarre tributes was this design, made to look like a pack of cigarettes, with the word 'brother' pinned across the bottom

He died on November 20, and was watching over for the night by family and friends ahead of the formal service today. 

Mr Colwyn, a former scrap metal worker, was described as 'popular and well-respected' and was known by everyone in the Welsh gypsy and traveller community.

His body was taken through the streets in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by five pick-up trucks full of flowers, including displays made into pints of beer, a security van, and the word 'brother'.

His cousin, also named Andrew Colwyn, 20, said: 'He was a very nice guy and everyone had a nice word to say about him.

'People have come over from all across the country to pay tribute to The Boy today, West Wales and all over the place.

'The Boy was very popular and well respected back in the day. But he got knocked over by a drink driver, 22 years ago now, and he just never recovered.

'We wanted to give him a proper send-off and that's why all the flowers represent what he loved. He loved boxing, The Boy did, he was an amateur boxer, and he loves his trucks and his dogs too.'

Mr Colwyn's family said he was an amateur boxer and loved cars, which explains this tribute shaped like a yellow Ford pick-up truck

A picture of Mr Colwyn is seen underneath the inscription 'Uncle Boy', a nod to his nickname 'The Boy'. To either side are boxing gloves, as Mr Colwyn was an amateur boxer before he was hit by a drunk driver

Among the flower displays was this blue Securicor van, presumably a reference to his love of vans

A pair of greyhounds (pictured front left and right) were also among the tributes to Mr Colwyn, which were paraded through the streets of Cardiff on the back of five trucks

Cousin John Price, 23, said: 'He was The Boy to everyone who knew him - and everyone did. 

'Go and knock on any door here in Splott, ask them if they know The Boy, and they'll tell you everything about the terrible accident that happened.

'He was in hospital for seven years after the accident and then his mum and dad looked after him full-time. They idolised him - he was their world.

'But he's with them now and he isn't suffering anymore and that's what matters.

'We've done this send-off for him to pay our respects and say our goodbyes at last because this is it really. Once you're gone you're gone but there's nothing we can do about that.

'But we can show our respect and how important he was to us all and how much we'll miss him.'

Police in Wales were forced to close roads along the procession route today after dozens of mourners showed up, saying there was the potential for disruption

Mr Colwyn's body was watched over by close family and friends during the 24 hours after he died, according to gypsy tradition, before being drawn through the streets of Cardiff by horse and carriage

Mr Colwyn, a scrap metal worker, was described as a 'popular and well-respected' man who was known throughout the Welsh traveller community

A traditional gypsy vigil was held all night for Mr Colwyn on Monday with the body left with family members at the Rover Way traveller site overnight.

His cousin Mr Colwyn added: 'It's a very old tradition. We don't eat any meat from the moment The Boy died to the moment he's buried.

'And there's no telly in the room where he is either, not until he's laid to rest. We left it quiet and respectful for him as well as a big fire to keep the body warm.'

Cardiff officials closed roads for the procession earlier today, saying there was a potential for disruption and a high amount of traffic.

Around six police officers were in attendance near St Alban's church, where the service was held.
