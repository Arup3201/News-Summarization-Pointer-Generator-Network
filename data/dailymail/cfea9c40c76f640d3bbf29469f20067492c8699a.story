A California man who set out to see what a homeless person would so with a cash donation of $100 says that no one is more surprised than he at what eventually transpired.

YouTube personality Josh Paler Lin — who has become somewhat known for his viral video pranks - uploaded a video on Monday that starts out with him handing a street beggar in Los Angeles the cash, then secretly following the man with a camera to see what he does.

When the man, known only as Thomas walks straight into a nearby Liquor Mart, Paler Lin believes he got the result he had though.

However Thomas actually went in to buy food, and then goes straight to a park where many other homeless people gather in order to hand out the offerings.

Gesture ... with an agenda: YouTube star Josh Paler Lin (right) gives $100 cash to a homeless man in LA, with the intention of following the beggar afterwards

You're welcome: The man begrudgingly accepts the money and says he is 'tearing up'

Next: The man, identified only as Thomas, then walks into a Liquor Mart

Shopping: Thomas emerges with at least two black grocery bags

'I wasn’t expecting to get this kind of footage… to be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first,' Paler Lin wrote on his YouTube page.

'But I’m so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. 

'This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel.

'I did not only just help a homeless man, but I actually met an incredible human being and a friend. 

'We were following him for a couple miles for almost an hour or so.'

Thomas told Paler Lin he quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street. 

Kindess: Thomas then goes to hand out food he bought with the money to other homeless people

Giving: The camera following Thomas show him handing food to a family

So taken aback by what happen, Paler Lin says he took the man the man out for dinner and put him up in a hotel for the night.

He also gave him an extra $100 cash. 

'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. 

'Never judge a book by its cover. One love!'

Grateful: Paler Lin says he was shocked at how the experiment turned out

Paler Lin also set a fundraising page on Indiegogo for Thomas, hoping to raise $10,000 for him.

It has already received over $35,000 in donations.

Some have questioned whether the scene was staged.

However Paler Lin has maintained it all developed naturally.
