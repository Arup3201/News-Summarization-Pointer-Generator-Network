From receiving the perfect present to spending quality time with the family, it doesn't take much to make most of us happy at Christmas.

But for those with the cash to spare, the festive season can be an altogether more glamorous affair thanks to one London hotel.

The Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel has launched a menu of bespoke celebrations, among them a personal bedtime story from Father Christmas and a private performance of the Nutcracker.

Ho ho ho: For £200, Father Christmas will come to your suite to personally read festive bedtime stories

Suite dreams: The performances are available to guests staying in the hotel's £469 per night suites

Other options, all of which are available in your suite, include a private pantomime and a visit from a choir or orchestra, primed in advance to sing your favourite carols.

But a bespoke Christmas doesn't come cheap - on top of the £469 per night cost of a suite, guests who want to book one of the packages can expect to pay £200 for a 45-minute ballet while the private choir costs £600.

Even Father Christmas doesn't come for free, with prices for a bedtime story courtesy of St. Nicholas starting at £200.

The packages, which are available between the 15th December and the 14th January, must also be booked at least two weeks in advance.

Glamorous: Guests can also have a private performance of the Nutcracker with their Christmas dinner

Luxury: Other packages available at the Mercer Street Hotel include private choir or orchestra performances

Nevertheless, general manager Dawn Thomas says she expects the bespoke stays, which also include free Christmas stockings and breakfast the next morning, to be popular with guests.

'London holds a special magic at Christmas, offering a rare moment of calm in an otherwise busy city,' she revealed.

'Seven Dials is unquestionably one of London’s most vibrant locations, with a rich individuality and a genuinely village feel.'

She added: 'We have seen ever more people staying with us at Christmas whether visiting family or friends in town or coming to the country for their Christmas break.

'This specially-designed package will offer those guests who want to free themselves from the pressure of Christmas but who want to stay in the city – to enjoy it at its most serene in the perfect intimate environment.'
