Radical: A British militant in Syria on a YouTube video - one of a growing number going to fight

Hundreds more British jihadists have now travelled to Syria, the UK’s police counter-terrorism chief admitted yesterday.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said the authorities are powerless to stop young Muslims heading to the war-torn state.

The Scotland Yard chief said the battle against the Assad regime acts like a ‘magnet’ – and fighters now number in the ‘mid’ rather than ‘low’ hundreds.

There is speculation the figure could be as high as 700 as the authorities admit they are struggling to monitor those who are in the Middle East.

Among those in Syria are children as young as 16, and even a small number of women who have gone to marry and care for militants.

The warning came as a national campaign to urge women to stop their loved ones going to Syria was criticised as fundamentally flawed.

The mothers, wives and sisters of potential jihadists were asked to contact the police so that officers can intervene.

But Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee, said that the police are not a counselling service.

He said: ‘It is unlikely that family members will want to report suspicions about their own children to the authorities. All the evidence indicates that the families themselves are last to know.

‘The police are not the Samaritans, they are the first step in the criminal enforcement process.’

Ministers are increasingly concerned at the growing numbers of Britons travelling to Syria to fight alongside militants.

Among the armed groups are terrorists fighting under the flag of Al Qaeda who want to bring sharia law to the broken state.

The fear is that young men will be radicalised while fighting on the front line, learning about weapons and bomb-making. If they survive, they could return to Britain with violent ideological ideas and launch domestic terrorist attacks.

Scotland Yard is considering whether to release graphic images of those injured in the fighting in a bid to discourage potential jihadists. Senior officers are concerned that young men are being groomed by romanticised propaganda on social networks, which promises ‘five star jihad’.

DAC Ball admitted that police could not physically stop anyone travelling to Syria, even if relatives reported them.

She said police and the security services face huge challenges as they try to monitor what is taking place in Syria and along its chaotic border with Turkey.

But, she added, anyone identified on their return as having joined the conflict – even for the Free Syrian Army – faces arrest under anti-terrorism laws.

Scotland Yard warned the Assad regime is increasingly becoming a 'magnet' for young extremists

More than 40 people have been arrested for crimes linked to Syria in the first three months of this year, compared to 25 in the whole of 2013.

Earlier this month prospective Brighton University student Abdullah Deghayes, 18, was killed in a gunfight in Kassab in Latakia.

His two brothers, Jaffar, 16, and Amer, 20, remain in Syria.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government is ‘very concerned’ about the threat posed by jihadists returning from Syria, adding: ‘We are trying to prevent people from travelling there.

‘If you know someone who is in danger of being radicalised, with radical views, and is thinking of travelling to Syria, then the best thing to do is to talk to the police, talk to the authorities so that we can help you.’
