Office of the future: Right now this home office from MWE Labs will set you back £30,000 but Microsoft has already started using them so one day our offices may be full of them

It may look like a prop from the latest Star Trek movie but this futuristic office is already in use.

The Emperor 200 is equipped with a touchscreen control centre, three 27in LED screens and an air-filtering system to control heat.

The home office’s manufacturer, MWE Lab, based in Quebec, Canada, describe it as the ‘ultimate computer workstation’ and says clients have included Microsoft programmers and the US Marine Corps.

The home office's manufacturer claims the Emperor 200 is the most advanced home office and comes equipped with a touchscreen control centre, three 27-in LED screens and air-filtering system to control heat.

The office comes equipped with a touchscreen for the left-hand, mouse pad for the right and three adjustable screens to easily reach eye-level.

The adjustable aluminium frame houses an Italian leather chair which allows you to swivel or work while lying on your back, meaning the days of suffering lower back pain from hours sitting hunched over your desk my soon be over.

frugal investors looking for something within the price range of a 
family car could consider the Emperor 200's sister products.

The Emperor
1510LX comes in at just under £14,000, or the same price as a brand new Volkswagen Jetta.

Meanwhile, the cheapest in the range, the Emperor 
1510 costs a mere £4,000,  although as the price suggests it lacks many of the features of its more expensive sister model.

Futuristic: The Emperor 200 looks like something out of Star Trek and can be yours for a mere £30,000

Comfort: Designed with comfort in mind the home office comes with an Italian leather chair that allows you to swivel or even work lying down

Expensive: Even the most reasonable version of MWE Lab's home office will cost £4.000. It is however already being used by the US Marine Corp and companies like Microsoft
