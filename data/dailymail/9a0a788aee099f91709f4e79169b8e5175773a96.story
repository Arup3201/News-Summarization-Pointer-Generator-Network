Vile: Douglas Slade was warned he faced 40 years in jail over child abuse but boasted that he would pay to get case dropped

A notorious British paedophile has built a house in the Philippines overlooking an elementary school and allegedly lures pupils as young as eight into his home where he abuses them for the price of a pair of flip-flops.

Wealthy Douglas Slade, 73 – a founder of the vilified Paedophile Information Exchange which campaigned for child sex in the 1970s – has been repeatedly arrested for taking nude photos and molesting underage boys in the Philippines.

But despite being on bail for cases involving pupils from the Amsic Elementary School in Angeles City, he continues to take pupils into his home, paying them the equivalent of two pounds a time for sex acts and photos, neighbours told the Mail Online.

Widower Slade, who grew rich from a food business he set up after moving to the Philippines in 1985, donates money to the school which claims it has received no complaints about him from parents – even though its pupils are among his alleged victims.

He has repeatedly had child sex charges against him dropped and was caught on camera in an ITV documentary in 1995 boasting that he could bribe prosecutors and the families of victims to avoid being convicted.

Since then, Slade – originally from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire – has built a new home overlooking a school for eight-to-12-year-olds where he is accused of committing multiple assaults on boys from the poor neighbourhood teeming with young children behind his house.

Boys as young as eight line up outside his house to be invited in by Slade who takes nude photos of them and gets them to perform sex acts on him for 150 pesos, say neighbours – the price of a pair of the ubiquitous flip-flops worn by nearly every boy in the Philippines.

'The boys sit on his doorstep after school,' said 17-year-old Angelica Alcantara, who lives near Slade's home, and says he has resumed inviting boys in since his arrest. 'He comes out and picks the ones he wants to come in and they go inside.

'He pays them to pose naked for pictures and to do other things for him. Afterwards he gives them 150 pesos (£2) and sends them home. He only picks boys. He never invites girls inside, even though they ask sometimes because they want the money.'

Danger: Douglas Slade has built a house directly opposite a primary school in Angeles City, pictured above. MailOnline has been told that he is preying on children at the school and paying £2 for 'sex acts' 

Predator: Paedophile Douglas Slade was confronted by MailOnline about his interest in the primary school opposite but claimed he was being set up and claimed 'someone wants me out of the country'

Peeping Tom: Douglas Slade has built a house with a view directly into the primary school opposite and is said to be paying children £2 for 'sex acts' 

Hiding: The 73-year-old spends time on his balcony gazing into the primary school opposite, where he also donates money despite facing repeated accusations of molesting children 

Randy Antedo, 38, said he moved his family from the neighbourhood to a new home around mile away when he discovered his eight-year-old son Christian had been going into Slade's house with a friend, also aged eight, last year.

'I am angry – a lot of people here are angry because of what he has been doing' said father-of-five Mr Antedo, who said he felt powerless to do anything because of Slade's wealth.

'A lot of kids have been going into his house and he gives them money to buy flip-flops after. We don't know what went on inside with our son, but we are very concerned and we moved away because we wanted to protect our children.'

Slade made headlines in the 1970s when he was a founder of the Paedophile Information Exchange and ran another underground group called Paedophile Action Liberation which campaigned to legalise child sex.

He fled Britain after being exposed as a paedophilia advocate in 1975 and being caught by a national newspaper telling fellow deviants: 'If you want sex with children don't bottle it up – do it.'

Bribe: Douglas Slade has been faced with charges before but boasted that he would pay to have them dropped. He is currently on bail for child abuse and under investigation for possessing child porn, police say

Exposed: As far back as 1975 Douglas Slade was revealed to be a supporter of sex with children but fled Britain after he was caught on tape boasting that people should just have sex with minors if they wanted

No shame: When confronted by MailOnline Douglas Slade said 'There have been five cases (against me) in four years. They've all been dismissed. Somebody is trying to f***ing get rid of me'

In 1995, he was warned he faced up to 40 years jail after being arrested at his previous home in Angeles City for allegedly molesting three boys aged 12 and 13. He denied the charges, claiming he had only given the boys 'grandfatherly kisses'.

The charges were dropped after Slade boasted on camera how he could pay off the prosecutor or pay the children's families to drop the charges in return for money. He said his lawyer would discuss terms with the families 'like Michael Jackson discussed terms'. 

He was arrested again in 2006 when he was allegedly caught with naked boys in the swimming pool of his previous home. Charges were also dropped.

In March 2013, Slade – who claims to have once been a chef on the Royal Yacht Britannia and now runs a food business called Home Base – was arrested over similar accusations by two 14-year-old boys but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.

In his submission to the court, Slade claimed he suffered from diabetes, took insulin injections three times a day and had not had sex for almost a decade. He said he was physically incapable of the sex acts he was alleged to have indulged in with the boys.

Then in July this year, Slade was arrested when he sent his laptop for repairs and a technician found images of naked children on it believed to be from the school opposite his home and reported him to the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation.

He was charged with having child pornography and three boys aged 14 and 15 then came forward to report him for abuse. Slade is currently on bail for child abuse and under investigation for possessing child porn, police say.

Shouting from his balcony overlooking the school, Slade refused to meet with a Mail Online reporter but claimed the charges against him were concocted and said one of them had been dismissed – apparently referring to child pornography case.

Standing guard: The entrance to Douglas Slade's imposing house in Angeles City is watched by a domestic staff member but the 73-year-old invites young boys in and offers them money 

Offered money: Angelica Alcantara, centre, who is not a victim of abuse but whose parents gave permission for her to talk to MailOnline and be pictured, said: 'The boys sit on his doorstep after school. He comes out and picks the ones he wants to come in and they go inside'. These children live in the neighbourhood in Angeles City, the Philippines, and their parents were happy for them to be photographed to highlight the dangers posed by Mr Slade but they are not victims

Slade obtained a court ruling that the evidence taken from his computer was stolen and inadmissible but that ruling is being challenged by prosecutors, Mail Online has been told.

'There have been five cases (against me) in four years,' Slade shouted. 'They've all been dismissed. Somebody is trying to f***ing get rid of me.' Asked why, Slade replied: 'If I knew that I'd be as smart as you are.'

He refused to discuss the cases saying: 'It's over now. The more I say the worse it gets … Nothing good ever comes of talking to journalists. I've been bothered by a*******s like you for 35 years.'

When Mail Online took his photograph, he got up off his chair and bolted inside, bellowing furiously: 'I don't want my picture in the papers. I'm 73 years old. You're an evil b*****d.'

The following morning, the deputy principal at Amsic Elementary School, who asked not to be named, confirmed to Mail Online that Slade was a benefactor but declined to say how much money he had donated.

'Mr Slade is one of our stakeholders and is helping our school. He has been living opposite us for about 10 years now and one of the things he has done is donate some materials for our computer room,' she said.

Asked if she was aware of the accusations against him, she said she was aware of the reports of his arrest but said: 'In our school we have no received any complaints (about him).'

'We thought the case was already closed because he was released by the police and he is back at his house.'

Mail Online has passed on the information it gathered from neighbours and the school to police in the Philippines.

· The criminal case against Douglas Slade is being monitored by two-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Father Shay Cullen who runs a charity in the Philippines called the Preda Foundation, helping victims of child sex abuse and trafficking.
