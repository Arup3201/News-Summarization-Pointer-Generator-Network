Facebook has starting testing ads that appear on your handset as soon as you walk into a store or visit a museum or landmark. 

It hopes the service, called place tips, could help it take on Yelp and Foursquare by offering information about shops and other locations. 

The firm is also working with stores in New York to test a bluetooth 'beacon' that can push an ad to a user's phone when they walk in.

The Dominique Ansel Bakery is one of the firm's testing out Facebook's new beacons - a bluetooth gadget in the store that sends an ad when people are nearby.

Your location is determined using cellular networks, Wi-Fi and GPS. 

It will be tested in Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty and JFK Airport.

In certain places, we’re also testing place tips using Facebook Bluetooth beacons, which send a signal to your phone that helps us show you the right tips for the right place. 

Beacons transmit Bluetooth signals in a range of about 500 feet. 

Facebook is these in a handful of businesses in New York such as The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Dominique Ansel Bakery, Strand Book Store, the burger joint at Le Parker Meridien Hotel, Brooklyn Bowl, Pianos, the Big Gay Ice Cream Shop and Veselka.

'Place tips will show you fun, useful and relevant info about the place you’re at,' the firm says.

'Starting today on Facebook for iPhone, place tips may show up at the top of your News Feed when you’re out and about.'

Tapping on place tips won’t post on Facebook or show anyone where you are, a move the firm hopes will ease privacy concerns.

Users can  turn place tips off or on at any time in your settings, or just hide tips about specific places. 

Place tips only appear if you’ve given Facebook permission to access your location on your phone, the firm said.

When you tap on place tips, users see a series of cards with info about the place they are at.

'If you choose to view place tips, you’ll find things like posts and photos your friends have shared with you about that place.

'You can also see information about the place, including posts from its Page, popular menu items and upcoming events.'

Your location is determined using cellular networks, Wi-Fi and GPS. 

It will be tested in Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty and JFK Airport.

'In certain places, we’re also testing place tips using Facebook Bluetooth beacons, which send a signal to your phone that helps us show you the right tips for the right place,' the firm said.

Beacons transmit Bluetooth signals in a range of about 500 feet, and are already used by Apple in its stores. 

It will be tested in Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty and JFK Airport.

The small units are attached to the wall in stores, and use bluetooth to work out when a customer is nearby.
