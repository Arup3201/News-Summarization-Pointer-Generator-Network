A JetBlue Airways captain who had to be restrained by passengers after he was locked out of the cockpit for ranting about religion and terrorists has been indicted.

A grand jury in Lubbock indicted Clayton F. Osbon on one count of interference of a flight crew - the same charge he's been held on since shortly after the March 27 incident on a Las Vegas bound flight.

Passengers aboard flight 191 watched 
in horror as  the 49-year-old ran through the aisle screaming 'say 
your prayers' and banged on the cockpit door after being locked out by 
his co-pilot Jason Dowd.

Osbon's attorney, Dean Roper, declined to comment, the attorney's secretary said Thursday.

Witnesses say Osbon ran through the cabin yelling about Jesus and al-Qaida, before four passengers wrestled the captain to the floor.

They
restrained him with seat belt extenders and zip tie handcuffs while the
first officer diverted the flight to land in Amarillo.

Osbon is undergoing a court-ordered psychiatric exam to determine whether he was legally sane and can stand trial.

Under
federal law, a conviction for interfering with a flight crew can bring 
up to 20 years in prison.

The offense is defined as assaulting or 
intimidating the crew, interfering with its duties or diminishing its 
ability to operate the plane.

Investigators
say Osbon told his co-pilot, 'things just don't matter', and rambled 
incoherently about religion shortly after the flight departed from New 
York.

His behavior became more erratic as the flight wore on, 
prosecutors say, and ended with the tense struggle in the cabin.

Passengers
said the pilot seemed disoriented, jittery and constantly sipped water 
when he first stormed from the cockpit and marched through the cabin.

Then, they said, he began to rant about threats linked to Iran, Iraq and
Afghanistan after crew members tried to calm him down at the back of 
the plane.

The prosecution 
motion that sought the psychiatric exam said the events of that day 
"establish a likelihood that Osbon may be suffering from a mental 
disease or defect."

A flight attendant's ribs were bruised while trying to restrain Osbon, but no one on board was seriously hurt.

A day after the incident JetBlue suspended Osbon pending a review of the flight.

The veteran pilot started flying as a 
teenager with his father Ronald who was killed after crashing his small 
plane while enroute to look for treasure in Fort Lauderdale, according 
to a 1995 story in the Washington Island Observer.

His friends and family say there had been 
no signs Osbon, who lives with his wife and son Richmond Hill, Georgia, may suffer from a break down.

Outburst: Passengers said the pilot lost it after he went back to the cockpit and realized he had been locked out by his co-pilot

Osbon has been married to his wife Connye since 2005, according to the pilot's Facebook page.

But witness accounts tell of a 
disturbed man, who about three hours into the flight, began behaving 
erratically, randomly talking with passengers on his way back to the 
cockpit before discovering he had been locked out after Dowd changed the
security code behind him.

When he went back to the cockpit and realized 
he had been locked out, a passenger told ABC News Osbon began screaming 'let 
me in'.

Mark Sellouk told CBS: 'He's banging 
on the door, yelling at the first officer, I think his name is Steve, 
'Bring the throttle to idle! Bring it to idle! Bring it to idle! We're 
going down, we're all going to die! Pray to Jesus. Open this goddamn 
door!'

Tony Antolino, a 40-year-old 
executive for a security firm, said the captain seemed disoriented and 
agitated, then began yelling about an unspecified threat linked to Iran,
Iraq and Afghanistan.

'They're
going to take us down, they're taking us down, they're going to take us
down. Say the Lord's prayer, say the Lord's prayer,' the captain 
screamed, according to Antolino.

Antolino, who said he sat in the 10th 
row, said he and three others tackled the captain as he ran for the 
cockpit door.

The passengers pinned the captain and held him down while the plane landed at 
Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport.

The flight had been packed with heavily built men 
heading to the 2012 International Security Conference in Las Vegas held for professionals working in ‘law enforcement, border
protection and campus security’.
