Kate Moss, who celebrated her 40th birthday this year, has been chosen to launch the brand's new 'Jackie Soft' bag, inspired and named after the iconic Jackie Kennedy Onassis.

Aiming to convey Gucci's jet-set style, the fast paced film sees Kate as a glamorous celebrity hounded by the world's media.

Set to the dynamic 'A Lizard State', performed by King Krule, the short film is shot from the perspective of a paparazzi pursuing Moss around Rome.

As her lover, played by fellow model Clement Chabernaud attempts to protect her from the camera, we hear the shutter clicking repeatedly, capturing Kate in hundreds of clandestine split second pictures.

As well as prominently showing off the Jackie tote, wearing five different styles of the bag, the film also displays numerous chic outfits from the latest collection from the design house.

From a leopard print suede trench to a full fur jacket slung nonchalantly over a tailored blue suit or worn over a silk chestnut blouse, and a very Jackie Kennedy inspired looking double--breasted baby pink woolen coat, Kate wears each look with the effortless cool she has become so renowned for. 

One of the numerous looks Kate sports in the film is a shaggy fur coat worn over a silk collared blouse

Friday Giannini, creative director of Gucci, said of the film: 'I have always admired Kate — she is an icon of today. A trendsetter, an independent woman and absolutely contemporary. 

'She embodies my fall-winter collection as a sophisticated woman who dresses to please herself rather than others.' 

The Jackie bag, which comes in 10 different variations, retails at £1,980.
