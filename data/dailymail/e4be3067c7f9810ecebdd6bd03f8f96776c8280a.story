Dressed in a red Batman-style mask, this self-styled 'superhero' who goes by the name Crimson Fist, considers himself a community crusader.

The anonymous vigilante patrols the streets of Atlanta's Castleberry Hill every night with his sidekick - and wife - 'Meta Data'.

Their mission - to clean up the streets, looking out for petty crime and picking up litter - but mostly making people laugh with their own form of street theatre.

Crimson Fist: The Atlanta 'superhero' who patrols the streets of Castleberry Hill fighting crime and picking up litter

On the lookout: With his wife, 'Meta Data' the double act keep a look out for anything suspicious

More resembling characters from the comedy film Kick-Ass than comic legends Batman or Superwoman, the masked duo have been pounding the streets every night for seven years and have become a common sight.

Speaking to Fox News, 'Crimson Fist' said: 'You have to play the part of the super hero if you really want to be effective. I feel like a superhero when I'm dressed like this. I can't say why but when I put it on... my brain feels like I'm actually ready to do this now.'

Meta Data, who wears a black mask, black choker, and low-cut black bodysuit, looks out for danger as the pair pound the streets. Crimson Fist is the one to deal with it.

Armed with a stun device which wraps around his knuckles, a set of handcuffs and pepper spray, the vigilantes don't take any chances.

'I'm not stupid. I understand there's a lot of dangers on the street and I prepare myself for them,' he said.

Alert: Always on the job, the two scan the street for car break-ins or anything untoward

Crimson Fist and Meta Data have kept their identities secret from the public, even keeping their evening escapades hidden from family

When they do find anything suspicious, however, the pair are quick to point out that they call the police.

The double act have kept their identities under wraps, even to their families. And they plan to keep it that way.

Meanwhile, the comedy duo realise their eccentric shenanigans could be misinterpreted by some and feel grateful their neighbours see the funny side.

'I feel really supported in this neighbourhood; for a guy who dresses up and runs around as a superhero all night, it's hard to come by.'

Armed: Realising the potential dangers of the streets, Crimson Fist arms himself - and demonstrates to the camera - his hidden stun device in his glove

If the double act do come across anything that looks suspicious, they are quick to call the police
