Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron tonight denied that the NHS was in crisis in a huge political row over the meltdown in A&E departments.

The Tories accused Labour of ‘hypocrisy’ and ‘making capital’ out of today’s figures on emergency admissions, after shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said ‘crisis’ was the only appropriate way to describe the situation.

Government MPs said the problems in the health service had their roots in Labour’s botched 2003 contract which allowed GPs to opt out of out-of-hours care, meaning people often have no choice but to go to A&E.

And the Liberal Democrats pointed out that A&E waiting times were much longer in Wales, where Labour is in control of the health service.

Health Secretary Mr Hunt said that while hospitals were clearly under pressure, there was ‘hope’ behind the ‘disappointing figures’.

And the Prime Minister said the problems were short-term as he accused unions of trying to ‘scaremonger’ after claiming the NHS was on the ‘brink of disaster’. Andrew Percy, a Conservative member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Labour are complete hypocrites to be making capital about this for three reasons.

‘First, they allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for their patients out-of-hours, leading to an instant jump in people turning up at A&E.

‘Second, they cut 50,000 hospital beds while they were in power, meaning there is not enough capacity. And finally they failed to predict and plan for the demographic expansion, particularly of older, frailer people.

‘This triple whammy has had a huge effect on A&E services which Labour hasn’t apologised for.’

Health professionals warned of a crisis in the English NHS after figures yesterday showed just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours – notably below the 95 per cent target. The situation in the Labour-run Welsh NHS is even worse – with only 83.3 per cent meeting the target in November.

Mr Hunt said: ‘The NHS always has a difficult winter period but I think it’s very important to say that even despite all the pressures that we’re hearing about this morning, nine out of ten people who go to English A&Es are being seen and treated within four hours. 

'That is a better performance than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.’ 

He added: ‘I think there is a bit more hope behind the disappointing figures – and they are disappointing – than perhaps some of the headlines today are suggesting.’

Mr Cameron admitted the NHS was under ‘pressure’, but insisted 2,500 more patients were being seen within four hours every day than four years ago.

He added: ‘We’ve got a longer-term issue which is making sure there are named GPs in your local area which are responsible for every single frail, elderly person. 

'A lot of the pressure on A&E is coming from frail, elderly people, often with many different health conditions, and the best place for them, frankly, is not A&E.

Mr Cameron also attacked Labour’s stewardship of the Welsh NHS, telling Heart Wales radio: ‘Wales is performing worse than the rest of the United Kingdom. 

That’s not the fault of the doctors and nurses – they do a fabulous job. It’s the politicians in Cardiff that have let them down.’

Mr Burnham said: ‘I think in parts of the country, it is a crisis. We have ambulances taking hours to arrive; we’ve got record numbers of people on trolleys, record numbers of emergency admissions through A&E.

‘And hospitals in six places saying they simply can’t accept people any more. I’d say when the health service can’t function and it has to make a declaration of that kind, that is a crisis.’
