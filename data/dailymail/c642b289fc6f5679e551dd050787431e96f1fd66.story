Private Pavel Touromov, 19, stands to attention as he takes his oath after completing his training to join the Russian army in the south-eastern Russian city of Ussuriysk

The driver of the 20-tonne BMP armoured personnel carrier starts his turn too early, inadvertently aiming his massive vehicle towards the 19-year-old solider

Still standing to attention, Private Touromov is unaware that the massive vehicle is just a few feet behind him as it continues on its incorrect course

Private Touromov had just completed his military training in the south-eastern Russian city of Ussuriysk when the accident happened.

Eyewitness Stanislav Popensku said: 'The armoured vehicle was part of a column in the passing out parade that was to drive past the assembled soldiers. But the driver took the curve too finely and hit Pavel as it went past.

'He went down and straight under the wheels, his body making the vehicle bounce. It was sickening to watch. I thought he was killed instantly but then amazingly he bounded up and ran off.'

Shocked eyewitnesses thought Private Touromov had been killed by the APC but he managed to stagger a few yards before collapsing.

His comrades broke ranks to run to his side. He was bleeding from the mouth and had suffered severe internal injuries according to medics. He was rushed to a military hospital where his condition was described as critical.

Military medic Dr Ignat Vavilov said: 'He has severe internal injuries but that is better than being dead which is what we all expected at first.

'He is a well liked guy with a good sense of humour and a fine outlook on life. People have begun lighting candles for him all over the camp hoping he will pull through.'

Russian military police have launched a full investigation into the incident.

Several of Private Touromov's colleagues dive out of the way, but the 19-year-old soldier is hit by the APC, with one eyewitness claiming he saw the massive vehicle 'bouncing' after striking the unfortunate recruit

Miraculously, Private Touromov manages to stagger away from the scene while the APC driver continues, unaware he has almost killed one of his comrades
