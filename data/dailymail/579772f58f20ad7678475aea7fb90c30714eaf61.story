When the ballots closed he was in for a nervous wait.

But when state media called the result, incredibly, the votes had gone Kim Jong Un's way.

In the true style of a despot, North Korea's supreme leader won his first election - with an almost impossible to believe 100 per cent approval.

After all, in a secretive one-party state like North Korea, there was only ever going to be Un winner.

Kim won
 every ballot cast by voters in his district, where he ran uncontested 
during the first elections to the Supreme People's Assembly legislature 
under his rule.

North Koreans went to the polls on 
Sunday to approve the new roster of deputies for the Supreme People's 
Assembly, the country's legislature.

The vote, more a political ritual than an election by Western standards, is generally held once every five years to rubber-stamp the assembly.

Though results for the other seats in the assembly had not yet been announced, North Korea's media quickly reported Kim had won in his district - located on the symbolic Mount Paekdu - without a single dissenting ballot.

In the previous elections, 687 deputies were chosen. This is first time the election had been held since Kim inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011.

'This is an expression of all the service personnel and people's absolute support and profound trust in supreme leader Kim Jong Un as they single-mindedly remain loyal to him,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

Voters in the election have no choice who to vote for - there is only one candidate's name on the ballot for each of the 687 districts.

Instead, they have the choice of voting yes or no, and according to official accounts virtually all choose yes. North Korea also typically puts turnout nationwide at over 99 per cent.

Mobile ballot boxes were created to 
cater to those who were ill and could not travel to balloting stations, state media reported.

A number of poems were also produced to 
celebrate voting under titles including 'The Billows of Emotion and 
Happiness' and 'We Go To Polling Station'.

Analysts will be closely watching to see if the deputies this time around reflect a generational change as Kim looks to solidify his power and replace older cadres with younger, more loyal ones.

The Supreme People's Assembly usually meets only rarely, often only once a year. In practice it has little power and when it is not in session, its work is done by a smaller and more powerful body called the Presidium.

The new parliament was expected to meet next month. No date has been officially announced.

The election comes after North Korea's second-most powerful man reappeared on TV, contradicting reports that he may have been purged from the isolated nation's leadership.

Choe Ryong Hae was seen close to the country's leader Kim Jong-un in pictures taken in the past couple of months, smiling but sporting a limp.

His reappearance in public refutes recent speculation that he had been purged by Kim, whose shake up of North Korea's elite included the execution of his uncle last year.
