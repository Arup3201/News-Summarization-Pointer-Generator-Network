Charges: Children would no longer be able to rack up big bills without their parents knowing under plans unveiled by the government

Mobile phone companies may have to contact customers when their monthly costs exceed £100 under plans to protect families from racking up huge bills.

A cap has been proposed after a spate of cases of so-called ‘bill shock’, when children run up internet bills worth thousands of pounds on their parents’ smartphones or iPads.

Children can play online games on a mobile phone or buy credits for apps at the touch of a button without the owner of the device being alerted to it.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said yesterday that new laws would force the industry to contact their customers about any suspicious activity before it spiralled out of control.

Her department hopes mobile phone providers will monitor their customers’ net usage in the same way as high street banks look out for fraud, and contact them about irregularities such as suddenly spending hours on a premium rate phone line or buying hundreds of credits for an online game.

Government sources said a cap of £100 was one of the options.

A survey this year found children have cost their parents an estimated £30million in unauthorised app purchases.

Five-year-old Danny Kitchen from Bristol made headlines when he racked up a £1,700 bill in just ten minutes while playing the game Zombie v Ninja on his parents’ iPad. Even David Cameron has expressed concerns about how easy it is to run up huge bills.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I worry about my children buying things, as happens now with in-app purchases.

‘You’ve set up some football game and the next thing you know you own half of Real Madrid.’

Racked up £600 bill in three hours: Lee Walters, 10, of Streetly, West Midlands, downloaded the 'Hay Day' app on his mother Katharyne William's old iPhone - and paid £19 a time to buy virtual diamonds and gold coins

Costly: Lee Walters innocently clicked on the 'buy now' option which appeared more than 12 times an hour - landing his mother Katharyne, 42, with a giant £613 bill

Ministers will also introduce a £50 cap 
on bills for lost and stolen phones, as already exists for some credit 
cards. Currently someone whose phone is stolen is liable for all the 
thief’s spending, and is vulnerable to scams whereby the thief rings a 
premium rate phone line they have set up.

A new policy paper states that while 
many phone companies text their customers when they incur high roaming 
charges abroad, there are many other causes of ‘bill shock’ such as high
data usage, misuse of lost or stolen phones, and unintentional 
purchases within apps which are unregulated.

It states: ‘With the proliferation of
internet- enabled mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, and an 
exponential increase in data consumption, consumers can find themselves 
facing bills that far exceed the amounts they expect. We expect mobile 
operators to develop and use a consistent approach to limit bill shock.

‘We will encourage them to adopt the measures set out by Ofcom, including: the introduction of text alerts to advise people when they approach their call limit and notification of the costs of making further calls; the promotion  of account management tools to enable customers to track their usage easily; and information about other steps that people can take to help themselves.’

The legislation will also introduce tougher penalties for nuisance callers, and make it clearer to the public how they can opt out of unwanted calls from marketing firms, after an explosion of calls about payment protection insurance.

Mrs Miller said: ‘The communications industry has undergone change at  an unprecedented pace over the last decade. In this digital age we must ensure the needs of the consumer are not lost in the dash for progress . . . the Government will ensure consumers are protected from potentially harmful content, soaring costs and contracts that don’t meet their needs.’

Costly mistake: Lee Neale, 43, faced a £4,000 bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing 'free' games on his iPad

Customers who accidentally rack up huge bills on iTunes do not have an automatic right to a refund.

But
Apple announced earlier this year that it will pay out £66million in 
compensation to parents in the U.S. whose children ran up massive bills 
using its free apps.

Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents' credit cards.

Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families.

A number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children.

These 'bait apps' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game.

When children purchase 'currency', their parent's iTunes account gets automatically charged.

Apple started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 2011.

But many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills.

A
US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania 
who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. 
In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly 
addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency.

Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).

The
case involves games such as Angry Birds, pictured above, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil 
Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads
on tablets such as Apple's iPad.

But
the company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK
and any refunds are currently given on a case-by-case basis.

The
Restrictions menu in Apple's iOS software lets you control in-app 
purchases, and can even be used to stop children downloading apps 
entirely.

Parents can set a password for in-app purchases or turn them off altogether.

It's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age-restricted content.

To prevent in-app purchases in iOS, open 'Settings' then choose 'General' and 'Restrictions'.

Then tap 'Enable Restrictions', choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm.

Now you can set restrictions from the menu below.

In the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off' to stop children's ability to run up bills.
