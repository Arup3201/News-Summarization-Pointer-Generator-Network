Perhaps it’s just time to close the doomed thing forever.

An amusement park in New York last night again shut a rollercoaster from which an amputee Iraq war veteran fell to his death last month.

A chain snapped on the Darien Lake Theme Park & Resort's Ride of Steel, which stranded 32 riders near the top of one of the rollercoaster's hills.

Tragic accident: Iraq veteran Sergeant James Hackemer visited the theme park with several members of his family, including his two daughters

Everyone could walk down the side of the track safely and the ride remains closed, park officials said.

Army Sergeant James Hackemer, 29, 
was riding the same ride on July 8 when he was lifted from his
seat, thrown to the ground and died.

Operator error was to blame for the 
father-of-two’s death from blunt force trauma and the park had improperly trained 
workers, state officials said.

Sergeant Hackemer, who was travelling
at 50mph when he flew out of his seat, lost both of his legs to a 
roadside bomb in Iraq in 2008.

Investigators said the ride was 
mechanically fine and safety devices were working properly but 
operators did not follow rules posted at the ride's entrance, which 
require that riders have both legs.

Two violations: The theme park was cited for not properly training the ride's operators and operators being unfamiliar with the coaster's safety requirements

Reopened to the public: The Ride of Steel roller coaster reaches speeds in excess of 70mph and its highest peak is 208ft

A seatbelt and metal bar restrain 
riders by the legs, shins and lap. But Sergeant Hackemer was noy wearing
his prosthetic legs when he shifted from his wheelchair into a front 
seat of the ride.

This wasn't the first serious accident
on the Ride of Steel that first launched following a 
$12million improvement to the park in 1999.

Shortly after its grand opening, Mike
Dwaileebe, then 37, of Olean, fell out of his seat 10ft to the ground 
as the ride was braking on its final approach near the station house.

Mr Dwaileebe suffered multiple rib fractures and internal injuries in the accident.

Six Flags, the operator of the park 
at the time, had argued that the injuries resulted because Dwaileebe, 
who weighed more than 300lbs, was too large for the seat's lap-restraint
bar to engage.

Park officials later added safety 
belts. But a Cattaraugus County jury found the park fully liable and 
awarded a $4million verdict to Mr Dwaileebe, before the case was eventually
settled for $2.85million.

The Labour Department said Darien 
Lake did not properly train the ride's operators on the safety and 
operations restrictions and operators were unfamiliar with the coaster's
safety requirements.

The ride, which had been closed since
the accident, was re-opened on July 22 after operators received fresh 
training in safety procedures and clearer safety signs were posted.

Managers were told to review all 
safety restrictions on every ride before the start of each operator's 
shift and there were due to be more random, unannounced audits to make 
sure rules are followed.

'We were all devastated by this 
tragedy, and are committed to doing everything we can to prevent 
something like this from ever reoccurring,' the park’s general manager 
Christopher Thorpe said.

Thrill ride enthusiasts said at the time the accident did not deter them from riding the roller coaster.

'Stuff happens,' said Shawn Lingg, 
30, of Rochester, who rode the coaster a few minutes after it reopened the first time.

Inspiring figure: Sergeant James Hackemer, pictured with charity workers, often spoke of his desire to stay active

'People get in car accidents all the time. They don't 
stop driving cars.'

Bill Pufky of Cicero, who was in the 
first car along with his 11-year-old daughter Rachel, said: 'Dad 
tightened everything a little tighter.'

He called the death 'a tragic 
and unfortunate accident.'

Sergeant Hackemer came out of his 
seat and its restraints on the last and second-highest of three hills on
the coaster, which reaches speeds in excess of 70mph and whose highest 
peak is 208ft.

The veteran struck the front of the 
eight-car train and fell about 150ft, landing on a grassy area.

He was 
on the ride with his nephew, Ashton, when the tragic accident happened.
