Manchester United's new South American duo Radamel Falcao and Marcos Rojo can expect a change of pace as they settle into English life.

That is the opinion of former Red Devil Juan Sebastian Veron who believes life in England - where you can relax and have a 'milky tea' - is much more laid back than in his native South America.

However, while home life will be more relaxed, time spent on the pitch will be much more hectic, according to the former Argentina international who played for both United and Chelsea in the Premier League.

Marcos Rojo has moved to the Premier League where the football is much more hectic than in South America, claims Juan Sebastian Veron

Veron told The Times: ‘You eat so early. Sometimes, with the team, we would eat at 6.30pm or 7pm. In Argentina nobody even thinks about eating until 9pm. At the earliest.

‘There are differences, of course. Everything is much more relaxed in England. In Argentina everything is rush, rush, rush. In England you come home from work and you take 10 or 15 minutes to have your te con leche – milky tea – and breathe. There are little things that are different but nothing major,' added the 39-year-old.

‘I noticed the change more on the pitch. It is hard to go from football that is very tactical, where there is a specific type of physicality needed, to one where the game does not stop.'

Juan Sebastian Veron spent two seasons at Manchester United before moving to Chelsea in 2003
