Britain's over-50s lost an average of £60,000 during the worst of the credit crunch, a study from a leading think-tank reveals today.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the richest 20 per cent of the over-50s saw an average of £162,500 wiped off their assets.

The loss is a combination of the fall in the value of their home and the drop in the value of their investments, such as tax-free Isas and  their shareholdings.

Impact: The richest 20 per cent of over 50s have seen an average £162,000 wiped off their assets thanks to economic downturn, while the average lost was nearly £60,000

The IFS report says: ‘The impact on this age group may be of particular concern because they are unlikely to be able to make up the losses  later in life.’

The IFS looked at the impact on personal finances of households in England that contained at least one over-50 between May 2007 and March 2009, the height of the credit crunch.

These households lost an average of £59,992, equal to 10 per cent of their assets, with £26,666 knocked off  their investments and £33,359 off  the value of their home.

The richest families lost a total of £162,465 – £86,217 of their investments and £75,585 from the value of their home.

Innocent: Dr Ros Altmann said that the over 50s were victims of financial problems caused by irresponsible borrowing and lending

Dr Ros Altmann, of old age specialists Saga, said: ‘The over-50s are innocent victims of the financial problems caused by irresponsible borrowing and lending by others.

‘Middle-class pension savers are finding that the income they were expecting will not materialise, due to falls in the value of their investments or rises in the costs of buying annuities. Many are faced with the stark choice of selling their home to release some money to live on, or continuing to work to make ends meet.’

A separate report out today has found that many older people expect they ‘will never retire’.

Rural investment firm NFU Mutual estimates that 1.4million people  aged over 64 are still working – and that four in ten said they will work until they drop.

Steven Meredith, a pension specialist at NFU Mutual, said: ‘For growing numbers of people, retirement  might not be one option they can afford to take.

‘At the root of this problem is a mismatch between expectation and reality. More people need to make financial provisions for their retirement to bridge this gap.’

The IFS said millions of people aged between 50 and State pension age have a poor, or non-existent, pension. It found 41 per cent will retire on less than two-thirds of their salary on retirement. It is only when other sources of income, such as inheritances and other savings, are taken into account that the number drops to just 10 per cent.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘The good news is more of us are living longer.

‘This means people are going to have to work beyond the traditional retirement age if they are to afford a good quality of life in retirement, and that’s why the state pension age will rise over the coming years for men and for women.’
