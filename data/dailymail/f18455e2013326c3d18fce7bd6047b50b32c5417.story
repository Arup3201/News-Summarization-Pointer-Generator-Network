A driver climbed to safety through the boot of his Mini Cooper after plunging into a freezing reservoir.

Incredibly, the unnamed driver was unhurt after he swerved to avoid an object on a tight bend next to the Blue Lagoon beauty spot at Belmont, Lancashire. 

The car's roof could be seen above the water, with the boot open.

Firefighters from Bolton North and Darwen stations and Lancashire Police went to the reservoir in Rivington Road at 10.40pm last night.

When emergency services arrived the man was not in his car, but he later returned to the scene in another vehicle.

Lancashire Police said the man ended up in the water after trying to avoid an object in the road and that there was no suggestion he had broken the law.

The body of water, off Rivington Road, near Belmont, is officially called Ward's Reservoir, but is known locally as The Blue Lagoon.

Resident Richard Guest said: 'This sort of thing happens regularly.

'If you came to me every week and told me there had been an accident at the Blue Lagoon, it wouldn't surprise me.

'It's a really tight bend and if you are even slightly out of control, you're in trouble.'

Another resident John Thompson added: 'It's a very dangerous road to drive on - it's terrible for vehicles, especially at night.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: 'We got a call from a member of the public at 10.40pm last night to say that there was a vehicle in the Blue Lagoon with its lights still on.

'The driver lost control of the car while trying to avoid an object in the road and the car has got into the water and sunk considerably.

'He has not suffered any injuries and there was no suggestion he had been drinking or speeding.

'We were at the scene for an hour.'
