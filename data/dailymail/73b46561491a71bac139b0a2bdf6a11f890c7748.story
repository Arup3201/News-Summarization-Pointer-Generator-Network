A porn star who was the face of a German far-right party has been fired - because she has sex with a black man in her latest film.

Ina Groll, who goes under the porn name 'Kitty Blair', had been widely featured in a high-profile campaign by the National Democratic Party of Germany (NDP).

She encouraged men to join the party by standing outside election polls dressed in revealing outfits.

Porn star: Ms Groll had been widely featured in a high-profile campaign by NDP, which was founded in 1964

But the blonde model has now been fired after senior NDP officals watched her latest porn film - and discovered she had slept with a black man. 

As the face of NPD, Ms Groll attended promotional events and starred on posters, while making friends with many senior neo-Nazis across Germany.

Party officials were apparently willing to turn a blind eye to Ms Groll's career choice, which saw her star naked in a number of adult films. 

But they could not ignore her sexual encounter with the black male in her latest movie, titled Kitty Discovers Sperm.

And once Ms Groll's actions were made public, a Facebook page was even formed to remove her from the party.

One member of the party wrote: 'Those who sell their body for money and disgrace their race have no place in our party.'

Following lengthy discussions and a party meeting, NDP officials decided to sever all ties with the porn star.

Founded in 1964, the NDP identifies itself as Germany's 'only significant patriotic force'.

The party, widely perceived as a neo-Nazi organisation, is currently represented in two of the country's 16 state parliaments.

An attempt by Germany's federal government to outlaw it failed in 2003.
