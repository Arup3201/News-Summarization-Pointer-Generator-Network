Father-of-six Eric Garner, 43, died on Thursday after being put in a chokehold by police and pinned to the ground on Staten Island

A father-of-six died on Thursday after being put in a chokehold by an NYPD officer.

Eric Garner, a 43-year-old who weighed 400lb and suffered from asthma, can be heard repeatedly shouting: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' in cellphone footage captured by outraged bystanders. 

Mr Garner was also pinned to the ground by five other cops, one of whom appeared to slam his head into the concrete.

The man, whom officers claimed was illegally selling cigarettes in Staten Island, stopped struggling after less than a minute and appeared to be unconscious.

Paramedics were called to the scene outside a beauty supply store in Tompkinsville around 5pm.

Mr Garner later died at Richmond University Medical Center following a cardiac arrest. 

Mr Garner leaves his wife Esaw, six children and two grandchildren.

His wife told the Daily News: 'When I kissed my husband this morning, I never thought it would be for the last time.'

She said that police gave her little information when she went to hospital to identify her husband's body.

Mr Garner allegedly had a history of selling untaxed cigarettes, the Daily News reported. 

But the deceased's family claimed the
 43-year-old father was simply breaking up a fight on Thursday and had no cigarettes
 on him at the time.

The father-of-six was not armed, according to reports.

Garner had a court date scheduled in October for selling untaxed cigarettes and pot possession.

His
 wife said that he had a history of ill health, including asthma and 
diabetes, which made it difficult for him to hold down a job.

On a video, obtained by the New York Daily News, Mr Garner is seen sitting outside a store when he is approached by plainclothes officers.

Mr Garner can be heard telling the cops: 'Every time you seem me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today.'

More officers arrive and when Mr Garner refuses to put his hands behind his back to be cuffed, an officer grabs him from behind in a chokehold. 

Several other officers then wrestle the man to the ground before one appears to pin his head to the concrete.

After repeatedly telling the officers 'I can't breathe', Mr Garner goes quiet and stops struggling.  

Police are seen on the cellphone footage trying to move bystanders away from the scene.

Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk

Residents reacted with fury following Mr Garner's death. After the incident, posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. 

Reverend Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told Staten Island Live: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.'

An NYPD internal affairs investigation was reportedly underway.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a full investigation into Mr Garner's death.

In a statement on Friday, the mayor said: 'On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Garner, who died yesterday afternoon while being placed in police custody.

'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD. That is a responsibility that Police Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously. We are harnessing all resources available to the City to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the circumstances of this tragic incident.

'The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau is working closely with the Office of the Richmond County District Attorney, which is leading this investigation.'
