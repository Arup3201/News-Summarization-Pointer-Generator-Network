Rebels detonated 60 tonnes of explosives packed underneath a large Syrian army base, blowing a hillside hundreds of metres into the air, an insurgent in the operation who provided footage of the attack said today.

An Islamic Front commander said that his brigade dug a 850-metre (2,800ft) tunnel underneath Wadi al-Deif base, which is surrounded by rebels but has remained inside government control for the entirety of the three-year-long civil war.

The casualty toll from the blast was not immediately known.

The commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not know how many government soldiers had been killed, but said it would help rebels break into the base, which has been used for attacks in the surrounding province of Idlib.

'Another attack like this and we won't even need to move in to take the base,' he said via Skype, adding that once rebels take the base they would control all of the south Idlib, which is situated in Syria's northwest bordering on Turkey.

The tactics mirror those employed during trench warfare in World War One when specialist miners would dig tunnels under No Man's Land to plant explosives beneath enemy lines.

After the detonation, the infantry would then move in, hoping to take advantage of the chaos that ensued.

Rebels fighting to overthrow President 
Bashar al-Assad regularly carry out guerrilla attacks but have only 
started using large tunnel bombs in recent weeks on military targets, 
including a hotel used by soldiers in Aleppo last week.

The government boasts far superior firepower and its forces killed more than 40 people, many of them civilians, in air strikes on Wednesday, a monitoring group said.

Fifteen people were killed, including three from an emergency medical team, during five air raids in Atarib in the northern province of Aleppo, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said early on Thursday.

Four rebel fighters were killed by air 
strikes in the same area, while 21 people, including women, were killed 
in air strikes on the Sarmada area in Idlib, the anti-Assad monitoring 
group said.

Gun battles, air
 strikes, car bombs, shelling and executions regularly kill more than 
200 people a day in Syria, where a conflict that started as a peaceful 
protest movement has killed over 150,000 people and forced millions from
 their homes.

Despite the 
carnage and loss of swathes of territory in the north and east to 
insurgents, Syria plans to hold a presidential election next month that 
is all but certain to give Assad a third term. Opponents have dismissed 
the vote as a farce.

A national newspaper reporter has been shot and a photographer badly beaten after they were double-crossed and kidnapped by rebel fighters in Syria.

Anthony Loyd was shot twice in the leg, while photographer Jack Hill was assaulted after he tried to escape from their captors in Tall Rifat, near the Turkish border. Both worked for The Times.

They had been attempting to return to Turkey with a local fixer and bodyguards after a three-day assignment in the ruined city of Aleppo when their car was forced off the road, the newspaper said.

Mr Loyd was foreign reporter of the year 
at the 2014 UK Press Awards, while Mr Hill was honoured by the UK 
Picture Editorâ€™s Guild for his Syrian images last year.

The paper said they identified their captors as men charged with providing them with safe passage to the border.

After the fixer and Mr Hill tried to escape, Mr Loyd was shot to prevent him trying to do the same.

The paper said that they were released after the Islamic Front, an anti-extremist rebel group, confronted the gang.

After Mr Loyd was treated in a local hospital the two reporters and their fixer made it across the border to Turkey.

A source who handled their extraction told The Times: 'They [the captors] had dollar signs in their eyes when they realised they had two western journalists.

'What they did not anticipate was loads of the Islamic Front turning up on their doorstep to get them back.'
