A bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in Sydney's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when Belinda Bartholomew, the girlfriend of Roosters star Aidan Guerra, tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast.

According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection.

However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business.

Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner

The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up.

There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 

'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. 

Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude

'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' 

However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine.

'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.'

But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured)

He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi.

Ms Bartholomew claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'.

'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said. 'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.'

'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added.

Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her.

'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to "take it and f*** off",' she claims.

'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. 

However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage.

'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. 

Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.'

'I'm going to assume it wasn't me who he was really angry at, however I just happened to be in there at the time.'
