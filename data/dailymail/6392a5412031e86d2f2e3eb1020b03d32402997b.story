Attorney-General George Brandis has called on Muslim leaders to save their young boys from turning into Islamic radicals.

Almost 60 Australians are currently in the Middle East fighting for extremists.

Most of them are fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra or Islamic State - breakaway groups of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda.

Mr Brandis' call comes just weeks after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir went missing from his Bankstown home - in the city's west - believed to be travelling to Iraq to link up with an Islamic terror group to fight in the troubled war zone.

It is thought the 17-year-old was brainwashed by jihadist recruitment videos posted online.

Speaking to media on Thursday, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'.

'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said.

It came directly after Director General of Security David Irvine said a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots.

'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said.

When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

Last month, Abdullah Elmir was the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family bound for Iraq in June.

The family said they hold grave concerns for his safety and fear he may 'never be seen again'.

They have heard from him once since his disappearance, contacting his mother to say he had arrived in Turkey.

Another Australian abroad is notorious convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf who has an active social media account, which he uses to urge his other Islamic countrymen to join the fight in the Middle East.

On his Twitter account, Sharrouf has sent out a call-to-arms as well as posting disturbing photos, including a picture of a young child brandishing a rifle.

Ten Australians have died in Syria and Iraq - the latest a 22-year-old Sydney man named Zakaria Raad who appeared in a recruitment video for Islamic State shortly before being ambushed in Syria.
