A bride has described why she decided to walk down the aisle bald after a shock cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy treatment left her without hair.

Kindergarten teacher Shannon Jones, 28, from Redding, Connecticut, discovered she had Hodgkin’s lymphoma four months before tying the knot last July.

Although doctors wanted her to put things on hold, Ms Jones went ahead with her nuptials, choosing to wear a head wrap fashioned from her mother's vintage bridal veil instead of a wig.

Bald and beautiful: Shannon Jones, 28, was diagnosed with cancer just four months before her wedding day

Novel idea: Instead of a wig, she wore a head wrap fashioned from her mother's vintage bridal veil to cover her baldness - the result of chemotherapy treatment

'You don’t envision getting married without any hair. I had envisioned my wedding since I was two years old,' the natural brunette told ABC News.

However, she revealed to StyleMePretty.com that she still 'felt like a beautiful bride' without her long tresses, adding, 'I had my dream wedding come true.'

A series of photographs from Ms Jones' wedding, held in Washington, D.C., show her getting ready with her bridesmaids before meeting her husband-to-be, Jeff O’Hara, at the altar.

Although she knew chemotherapy treatment would cause her hair to fall out and take its toll on her energy levels she decided to go ahead with her wedding.

'I needed to have something amazing to look forward to,' she said.

The bride-to-be worked with doctors to schedule her treatment session so that her wedding would fall on an 'off-week' when she would be feeling healthier.

And the planning appears to have worked well as Ms Jones looks happy and radiant in her wedding photos.

Almost one year on she is now in remission. Specialists gave her the all-clear last fall.

She and Mr O'Hara are finally in the process of planning their honeymoon - one thing that they did decide to put on hold.

Looking at the positive, Ms Jones told ABC News that her illness made her focus on the things that really matter in life.

'I know what’s important know and what’s something that doesn’t mean that much.

'It put into perspective the marriage and what’s a wedding celebration means.'

She continued: 'When we said our vows in sickness and health it really meant a lot.

'At that time in our lives being sick and [trying to be healthy]…we both got so emotional and choked up.'

Ms Jones praised her husband for helping keep her spirits high.

She concluded: 'He is an amazing husband . . . He has been [by] my side supporting me through this battle in beating cancer.

'It’s wonderful to be healthy again and to feel like a human again.'
