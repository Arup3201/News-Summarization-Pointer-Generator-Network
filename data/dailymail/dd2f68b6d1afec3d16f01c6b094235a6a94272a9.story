A father and his two sons-in-law have perished in a small plane crash - widowing the man's wife of 30 years and their two pregnant daughters.

Doug Symiczek,
 49, Kyle Parton, 29, and Jacob Griffiths, 32, 
died when the single engine of Symiczek's small plane apparently failed 
as they flew in Lake Elsinore, California on July 6.

In unimaginable tragedy for the family, Parton's wife Breanna was due to give birth to their second child on the day of the crash. The little girl, Trulee Ann Skyler Parton, was born on July 13 - a week after her father's death, according to the family's GoFundMe page.

Griffiths' wife, Amanda, was also three months pregnant at the time of the fatal crash. The couple had posed for photographs to announce their happy news just one day before the tragedy.

The women's mother, Kim, and father were also preparing to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary, perhaps on a trip in Hawaii, the Press Enterprise reported.

The tragedy means all three women lost their husbands, while the two sisters also lost their dad.

On July 6, the three men were planning on taking a quick trip from French Valley to Corona Airport and then back again for breakfast before they hoped to enjoy a day boating on Lake Elsinore.

But on their journey, Symiczek's 1967 Piper PA28 suddenly made a sharp turn, clipped some trees and crashed into the mountains 
above Lake Elsinore shortly after 9am, witnesses said.

The family said initial reports suggest the plane’s single engine may have failed.

'(Doug) 
knew what was going on, and that
 he needed to land right away,' his sister-in-law Beckie Dennison said. 
'If he hadn’t hit the tree, they would have landed safely. It’s such a 
freak accident.'

Together: Doug and Kim were planning to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary this month

Tragic: Breanna Parton was due to give birth to their second child the day Kyle passed away

Missed: Griffiths, pictured with his sister right, was so excited to be a father for the first time, his mother said

Symiczek,
 49, had flown planes since 1990 and had owned the plane since 1991. 
Friends said he had hired a company to rebuild the engine and the plane 
had recently been cleared to fly.

The
 National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause and a 
preliminary report is due out this week - but it may take up to a year 
to determine the exact cause of the deadly crash.

Kyle Parton also leaves behind a three-year-old son, Ryder. The baby was to be Griffiths' first child.

Just days before the crash, he had sent his father, Scott, a photo of himself shortly after he was born.

'He was so excited about their baby,' his mother Susan Griffiths told the Orange County Register.

Crash: The trio were flying in Symiczek's 1967 Piper PA28 (file picture) when they suddenly hit trees and crashed into the mountains. Family members said the single engine apparently failed

Before he headed on Sunday's flight, 'he kissed (Amanda's) belly and said "I love you" and I'll 
see you in a little while', his mother said.

Just a day earlier, he and Amanda had taken photos to announce the pregnancy.

Symiczek, an experienced pilot, had owned DJS Fabrications, a tool making company. His wife Kim has vowed to keep the business running.

'They were the most amazing men – all of
 them,' she told the Press Enterprise. 'My husband was the
 best pilot ever.'

Friends have set up a GoFundMe page for the widowed women.
