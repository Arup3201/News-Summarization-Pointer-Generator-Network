Pubs and nightclubs routinely break a law which says they should refuse to serve people who are already drunk, research has claimed.

Actors staggered to the bar at more than 70 pubs, bars and nightclubs in one northern English city and ordered a vodka and coke in a 'loud, slurred' voice.

Some 84 per cent of the time they were served - with the success rate rising to 94 per cent on Friday nights and 96 per cent after midnight.

A study said the actors were often served even though bartenders recognised they were drunk - by remarking on it to colleagues or rolling their eyes.

Campaigners say preventing sales of alcohol to already drunk people would protect long-term health and reduce the strain on the NHS.

The study was carried out by a team at the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Violence Prevention at Liverpool John Moores University.

Four student actors aged 20 to 22 - two male and two female - were recruited through auditions and taught how to act drunk.

Their impersonation included slurred speech, being unsteady on their feet and having difficulty focusing and was tested on police.

In each attempt to buy alcohol, one actor pretended to be drunk while a second actor took on the role of sober friend.

Binge: Despite the actors staggering and slurring words, a fifth were asked if they wanted a double shot

The 'drunk' actor stumbled to the bar and used 'loud, slurred speech' to ask the price of a vodka and coke, before fumbling over their purse or wallet as they bought the drink.

The attempts - made from Wednesday to Sunday evenings between 9pm and 3am - were successful at least 60 per cent of the time on every night.

The hit rate was the lowest on Wednesdays when the actors were refused service two out of every five times.

Before midnight, the actors would be served on average 78 per cent of the time, but this rose to 96 per cent after midnight.

In almost one in five sales (18 per cent), bar staff even tried to sell the candidates more alcohol - by suggesting they 'double up' their vodka and coke.

Overall, 73 randomly-selected pubs, bars and clubs were tested in an unnamed city in the north west of England.

The study's authors said: 'UK law preventing sales of alcohol to drunks is routinely broken in nightlife environments, yet prosecutions are rare (three in 2010).

'Nightlife drunkenness places enormous burdens on health and health services.

'Preventing alcohol sales to drunks should be a public health priority, while policy failures on issues, such as alcohol pricing, are revisited.'

The Licensing Act 2003 makes it illegal to sell alcohol to someone who is drunk, or even to try and buy it on their behalf.

In theory offenders can be fined Â£1,000, but prosecutions are almost unheard of.

The study found venues with 'indicators of poor management' - such as cheap alcohol promotions, young bar workers, young clientele, crowds, poor lighting, rowdiness, dirtiness and high levels of drunkenness - were most likely to serve the fake drunks.

The actors were almost always successful in venues which had bouncers (95 per cent of the time), compared to a two-thirds success rate in those without.

The authors added: 'Although our study focused on one city, a lack of prosecution for sales to drunks throughout England suggests this is typical of nightlife environments nationally.

'With policies to prevent alcohol-related harm by increasing alcohol prices failing to be implemented, increased use of legislation preventing sales of alcohol to drunks should be considered a public health priority.'

The study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.
