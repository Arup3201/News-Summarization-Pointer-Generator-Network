A trip to the big city turned into a disaster for a Chinese man and his family after he was persuaded to take part in a game of mahjong, and was thrown out of an 11th floor window when he was unable to pay a £6,000 debt.

Terrified Guo Xu, 35, went hurtling through the air and fell several stories before he hit a chimney and an air vent several stories below where he was wedged tight and had to be cut free by firemen.

He told police they had come from their home in southwest Henan province in central China to the provincial capital Zhengzhou to take a holiday and that his wife had decided to take their son, aged 5, to the zoo.

Pushed: Guo Xu fell several storeys before he hit a chimney and an air vent, where he was wedged tight and had to be cut free by firemen

Miraculous: Mr Xu fell to the third floor, but managed to survive

He had then gone to the hotel's card room to play chess and cards, and had then been persuaded to play a game of mahjong.

But although he had been a good player back in his village he was no match for the city players, and his dreams of big winnings ended up with big losses of £6,000, an amount he simply did not have.

After the demand got more heated, he was grabbed by the angry players and lobbed out of the window.

Escape: Mr Xu had to be cut free by firefighters and carefully lowered down to the ground on a stretcher

Extreme reaction: He was thrown out of the window as he could not pay a £6000 debt he racked up playing mahjong

Injured: Doctors have said that Mr Xu may need to have his legs amputated

Mr Xu was on holiday with his wife and son when the horrific incident took place

Hospitalised: Medics said that Mr Xu appeared to be paralysed from the waist down

Police said that it had been a difficult operation to free him from the 3rd floor spot where he had been trapped and that he appeared to have been paralysed from the waist down.

What’s more, doctors said that they may have to amputate his legs, which suffered from loss of blood after he was wedged in by the chimney.

His wife said. ‘Our lives have been ruined by this, he is the money earner for our family, we have no savings for medical bills and nothing to pay our bills, how will I look after him without any money?’

Intrigued: A crowd of onlookers watch as Mr Xu is rescued
