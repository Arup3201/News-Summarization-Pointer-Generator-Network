It's a birthday that Doctor Who fans are undoubtedly thrilled to celebrate.

The 50th anniversary episode of the famous sci-fi series will be aired this Saturday - and whereas most birthdays are marked with a card, this one has been immortalised by the covers of Radio Times.

The Radio Times introduced the first ever episode on the week of Saturday 23 November and the next week it got its first cover on the magazine.

William Hartnell was the first Time Lord, and was followed by Patrick Troughton in the Doctor's footsteps

Jon Pertwee was the third Doctor in the seventies, while Tom Baker took up the reins and made the part his own with his eccentric speech and costumes - and a tendency for long scarfs and jelly babies

Peter Davison took on the role in the eighties, while Sylvester McCoy made the Doctor a much more darker and more manipulative character

Five decades and 50 appearances later they have decided to celebrate Doctor Who's 50th anniversary with 12 different covers, featuring 12 incarnations of the Time Lord.

However, whereas viewers across the country will welcome the new episode, some older members of the audience will remember that technically the show isn't 50, owing to the period when it was dropped from our screens.

Doctor Who boss Steven Moffat has criticised BBC bosses for axing the sci-fi show in the 1980s.

Michael Grade, then BBC1 controller, made the decision to 'rest' the series because it had become 'ghastly' and 'pathetic'.

Paul McGann appeared in the sci-fi television film in 1966, while Colin Baker played both the Doctor and Commander Maxil

John Hurt starred as an unknown incarnation of the Doctor, while Christopher Eccleston played the Doctor in 2005 - and was the first actor to take the role despite being born after the series was created

David Tennant fulfilled his childhood dream by playing the Time Lord, while Matt Smith is the youngest person to play the Doctor

Executive producer Moffat told the Radio 
Times: 'What can one say about 50 years of Doctor Who? Well, first of 
all, one can be pedantic.

'Doctor Who hasn't been on for 50 
years - owing to the outright stupidity and unforgivable blindness of 
the BBC (sorry guys, it needs to be said), there was a 16-year gap.'

He added: 'That gap is important though. It confers something very special on this most special of all shows, immortality.

'Doctor Who...is the show that comes back. Axe it at your peril. Someone like me is going to call you a fool.'

Lord Grade previously defended his decision to drop the show.

'My
argument with the producer was that the same audience watching Doctor 
Who was watching Star Wars and ET. The show was ghastly. It was 
pathetic.

'It just got more 
and more violent; they resorted to the most horrific hangings. It was 
just horrible to watch. It lost its way, ' he said.

He
wrote in Steve Berry's book Behind The Sofa: Celebrity Memories of 
Doctor Who: 'Now the production values are high, the scripts are witty, 
it's full of invention.

'And
digital effects today enable you to do so much more. The only 
connection it has with its previous life is the title and the premise, 
but it's light years ahead.'

BBC director-general Tony Hall told the magazine that 'it was the BBC who reinvented' the show 'with some the best acting and writing on television anywhere in the world.'

Meanwhile, former Doctor Who star Tennant said that returning to the programme for the one-off appearance in The Day Of The Doctor felt like waking up out of a dream.

'The first day I arrived, the costume's hanging there like it used to every day. It feels like 'where have I been? Have I just woken out of a dream?'', he said.

John Hurt, who has a starring role in the 50th anniversary episode, said that he was not a fan of the original series.

'I don't think I saw the first episode and I think it escaped me for quite a long time. It was a kiddies' programme, or it was assumed to be. It was known basically for the fact that all the scenery used to fall over,' he said.

Today the Daleks invaded Buckingham Palace as stars of Doctor Who past and present attended a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the show.

Four Time Lords in total - Matt Smith, Tom Baker, Peter Davison and John Hurt - were in attendance at the event hosted by the Countess of Wessex, who herself has been fan of the show since she was a child.

Props from the show, including two versions of the Tardis, a pair of Daleks and K-9 the robot dog, were set up in the Palace’s Bow Room.
