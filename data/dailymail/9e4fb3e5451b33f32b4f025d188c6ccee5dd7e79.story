It has baffled scientists for years - why the penguin waddles in such a distinctive manner.

Most other diving birds are able to simply fly on land - but not the penguin.

Now, researchers hope to unravel the mystery of the waddle - and find out how it evolved

Watch the penguins on their custom catwalk

Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. 

Researchers set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it.

Researchers also filmed the walk in slow motion, and are looking for the forces the birds excert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are.

Scientists from the Royal Veterinary College and University of Texas at Austin have visited London Zoo to study the way the animals walk.

Prof John Hutchison from the RVC said: 'The upright posture and waddling gait of penguins is not often seen in other birds. 

'Most wing-propelled diving birds move using flight when they are not in the water.'

Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the Humboldt penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. 

'We're trying to understand the minute detail of how waddling works with living penguins, and then taking that back in time, looking at the fossil record of penguins to understand how evolving for such a specialised underwater lifestyle has affected their ability to move on land,' said Proffitt.

'We set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it.

If they want to move quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain they may jump with both feet together.

'We were looking for the forces they exert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are.'

'Zoos provide an opportunity for research scientists to look at organisms that otherwise would be very difficult to study in the wild.' 

Penguin keeper Zuzanna Matyasova said: 'We know our penguins really well, we know what they eat, we know how they behave on a day to day basis, and we know how to breed them for conservation purposes. 

'But to know how they evolved to be like this is very important.'
