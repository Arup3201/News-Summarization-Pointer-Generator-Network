A British monk has died after dousing himself in petrol and setting himself on fire at a Buddhist monastery in southern France.

Venerable Lobsang Tonden, 38, who was born David Alain, may have been making a 'political gesture' against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, police said.

Horrified fellow monks discovered the man ablaze at the Nalanda monastery in the village of Labastide-Saint-Georges at 5pm on Thursday.

Firefighters and police were called to the scene but were unable to save the monk's life.

Gendarmerie
colonel Pierre Bouquin said: 'The man appears to have poured petrol 
over his head and clothes and set himself on fire.

'He was discovered a few minutes later by other monks in a garden at the monastery.

'We
believe he may have been making a political gesture related to Tibet 
but an investigation will be carried out to establish the full facts.'

Protest: Images on the Nalanda monastery website show monks supporting Tibetan monks in their struggle against China - this self-immolation is suspected to be in support of Tibet

Discovery: Monks from the monastery stumbled across the Brit ablaze in the garden

Head monk the Venerable Lobsang Tendar said the victim had been at the monastery for five years but had no comment to make on the tragedy.

The Nalanda monastery was set up in 1981 and has around 50 monks from 20 countries.

Self-immolation by Buddhist monks occurs has occurred around 60 times since March 2011 in Tibet, as gestures of defiance against the Chinese occupation of their country and oppression of Tibetan culture and religion.

Tension has risen in the past year but
Beijing insists that Tibetans have benefited from improved living 
standards brought on by China and say the monks enjoy religious freedom.

There has been a spate of
self-immolations in recent days with Chinese military forces mobilised 
in occupied Tibet on November 8 after a trio of teenage monks set fire 
to themselves.

The boys called out for freedom 
in Tibet and for the return of the Dalai Lama as they set themselves on 
fire. Security forces arrived at the scene almost immediately.

The youngest monk, 15-year-old Dorjee, died at the scene.

His companions, 16-year-olds Samdup and Dorjee Kyab, were taken to hospital by security forces.

In late October Dorjee Rinchen, 58, set himself alight outside a Chinese government building.

He burned to death in Labrang, 
occupied Tibet, and security forces clashed with mourners when they 
attempted to bring his body back to the Gansu province, northwestern 
China.

When Tibetan monks from the Labrang Monastery, the scene of Monday’s self immolation, later attempted to visit Mr Rinchen’s home to pray, they were stopped by security and forced to pray by the roadside.

Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden said: 'Dorjee Rinchen is the second Tibetan to set himself on fire in Labrang in two days.

'Like many Tibetans in the last eighteen months, he set himself on fire in front of a government building that symbolises China’s occupation.

'Tibetans are paying a terrible price for the Communist Party leadership’s determination to maintain stability.'
