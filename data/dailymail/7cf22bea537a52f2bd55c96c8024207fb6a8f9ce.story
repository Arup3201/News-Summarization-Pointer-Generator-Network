When last season saw PPQ's Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker shun their trademark pop art prints in favour of Oscar-worthy gowns, the fashion pack was caught flat-footed.

Luckily for print fans, their focus on Hollywood hasn't lasted and this time around, the design duo opted for a quirky celebration of all that's fabulous about London's rock n' roll party scene.

Prints, metallics and some wonderfully wearable cashmere coats combined to make A/W14 one of their best collections to date.

Elegant: PPQ's London rocker inspired look combined edgy styling with luxe fabrics

The duo themselves described their muse as ‘pale and very significant, swathed in a multitude of very necessary textures in her winter embrace’.

This translated as a catwalk awash with plenty of fur, powder pink silk catsuits, metallic leggings and lashings of edgy PVC.

Speaking ahead of their show at London's Sanderson hotel last night, Amy told MailOnline: ‘This season we’ve gone very London and the models we’ve chosen are all very PPQ.

‘They’re models that have been with us for a long time, they’ve grown up with PPQ and we wanted to reconnect with them.  

‘We’ve been on lots of different journeys but this season, our PPQ jean is back, our bomber jacket is back; just pieces that we’ve missed.’

Pastel perfection: The lilac trend looks set to continue into next autumn if PPQ have their way

Speaking about the PPQ woman for A/W14, Amy said: ‘It’s not very King’s Road, it’s our London vibe. I wouldn’t say she lives in the city, I’d say she lives more in the countryside but she’s definitely rock ‘n’ roll.

‘She’s a party girl but she likes weekends away in the country.’

Their signature print for the season came in the form of what they describe as ‘a kind of beauty and the beast rose’.  

Amy, who was born in South Africa and brought up in Cheshire, and Percy, who hails from the Isle of Wight, took their signature floral motif and turned up the volume, splashing across sumptuous satin in a dirty lilac hue.

‘It’s got that really edgy feel but it’s still a luxury fabric,’ explained Amy.

Glamorous: TV presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford and model Chloe Hayward upped the fashion ante front row

Highlights included a floor length velvet number, which Amy admitted she had a ‘bit of a crush on’, as well as high shine PVC bombers and a fur trimmed catsuit.

The duo, who celebrated after the show at their favourite haunt, the Long Bar at Sanderson, revealed they’d love to see Ellie Goulding take centre stage in one of their designs.  

While the songstress was absent this season, the front row was occupied by a galaxy of stars, among them Made in Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock and model-turned-actress, Chloe Hayward.

But while the front row caught the eye, they couldn't compete with the clothes: PPQ's print-heavy greatest hits collection proving the real star of the show.
