Jodie Williams ran a blistering 22.79secs to become the British women’s 200 metres champion on Saturday.

The 20-year-old came within three hundredths of a second of her lifetime best, while Bianca Williams and Anyika Onuora also broke the 23-second barrier.

Williams could yet make it a double in Birmingham after qualifying quickest for Sunday’s 100m semi-finals with 11.49secs.
