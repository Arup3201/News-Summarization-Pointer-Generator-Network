A top-secret Nazi war dossier has come to light which reveals Hitler's chilling plans to invade Ireland during the Second World War.

The document contains detailed maps and postcards of the country and has been kept by a family out of public view since the end of war.

And it reveals that even though Ireland was officially neutral during the conflict, Hitler still viewed the country as a target for invasion.

The Irish allowed German U-boats and submarines into their waters during the Second World War, but the booklet entitled Militargeographische Angaben uber Irland pinpoints key cities and other sites in Ireland for destruction.

A new document has come to light which reveals Hitler's plans to attack Ireland, left. The dossier includes eight pull out maps where key cities and other important locations are numbered, right

Postcards, such as this one of Dublin, are also included in the 
document to provide extra information about the layout of key sites

The document - handed to high ranking 
Nazi officers - also included pictures of key locations such as dams, 
ports, cities, high ground and beaches which the German High Command 
believed would be of importance when they invaded.

These
key places were numbered by military officials before being plotted on a
series of eight fold-out maps, which would have been used during 
'Operation Sealion.'

On 
September 17, 1940 Hitler was forced to scrap Operation Sealion because 
of the Luftwaffe's failure to gain air supremacy over England during the
Battle of Britain.

The Nazi
offensive never took place after the German defeat in the skies, but 
experts believe the book reveals what could have happened if the Nazi's 
had conquered Britain.

The scarce copy of 'Militargeographische Angaben uber Irland' published 
in 1940 has been uncovered for the first time after it was kept in the 
same family following the end of the Second World War

Although the Nazi offensive never took place, experts believe the book reveals what could have happened if 
the Hitler had conquered Britain

The document is expected to fetch up to £600 when it goes under the hammer at Ludlow Race Course tomorrow

scarce copy the document which was published in 1940 is expected to 
fetch up to £600 when it goes under the hammer at Ludlow Race Course 
tomorrow.

Historical documents expert
Richard Westwood Brookes, of Mullocks Auctioneers, said the booklet 
shows how the Irish were wrong to believe they were safe from invasion 
after accommodating the Nazis during the war.

He said: 'This will come as quite a surprise as the Irish believed that the country's neutrality protected them from the Nazis.

'They were clearly wrong and it is a very sobering reminder that no one in the world was safe from the evil of Hitler.

'Despite
the fact that many Irish were sympathetic to Germany throughout the 
war, they were clearly earmarked by the Nais for invasion and for the 
same fate as all the other countries in Europe.

Mr
Westwood Brookes said it was also possible that Hitler might considered
invading Ireland first to establish an invasion force there for a later
attack on the UK mainland.

He added: 'It would have made complete military 
sense for the Germans to invade Ireland as it was a perfect location to 
set up to reinvade England in a bid to take Britain back from the 
Germans.

'Ireland had strategic links to America as well so it would have made tactical sense for them to occupy the country swiftly.

'We have naturally come across invasion plans for Britain before but I have never seen one for Ireland.

'We are really expecting interest from
Irish collectors - it is, after all, part of their history that more 
than likely they were completely unaware of.'

Among the postcard set is this image of Stormont, in Belfast, which is now the home to the Northern Ireland Assembly

Although historians have discovered invasion plans for Britain before 
this is the first time a detailed plan for taking Ireland has been uncovered

Expert Richard Westwood Brookes said the document shows how the Irish 
were wrong to believe they were safe from invasion after accommodating 
the Nazis during the war

This picture shows the built up centre of Belfast - experts are expecting interest from 
Irish collectors as the dossier provides a chilling reminder of what 
might have been had Hitler followed through with plans to invade the country
