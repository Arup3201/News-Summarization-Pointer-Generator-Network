Perhaps it goes without saying that when it comes to wanton narcissism and rampant self-satisfaction, the ranks of the supermodel sisterhood take some beating.

But for sheer ineffable smugness, Gisele Bundchen has long been in a league of her own.

Now even she has outdone herself. This week, the world's top model posted a photo on her official Twitter feed and Instagram account that shows her reclining, all caramel limbs and honey-hued tresses, as a team of stylists pamper every inch of her billion-dollar body.

Multi-tasking, Gisele-style: The supermodel feeds her daughter while having her hair, nails and make-up done

Languidly raising a lithe arm for her manicurist while her hairdresser and make-up artist attend to her other beauty needs, the Brazilian glamour-puss is captured in her suitably stylish high-rise apartment dressed in a luxuriously fluffy white bathrobe.

Look a bit closer, however, and her dressing gown is pulled discreetly open. In her other arm she cradles her one-year-old daughter, Vivian, while the child contentedly breastfeeds.

'What would I do without this beauty squad after 15 hours of flying and only 3 hours of sleep?' Miss Bundchen trilled in a caption.

And in case anyone is in doubt about how exhausting the life of a catwalk glamazon can be, she also added the hashtag '#multitasking' to her message, just to press home the point.

No doubt Gisele hopes her 1.6 million Twitter followers will wonder just how on earth she does it.

But, then, being as out-of-touch as she is gorgeous seems to come naturally to the 33-year-old model.

Smug: Gisele told Vogue that after the birth of her first child she regained her figure effortlessly and instantly by doing yoga

Take, for example, her pearls of wisdom on breastfeeding, of which she is a highly vocal advocate. (Indeed, this latest picture is yet another salvo in Gisele's personal war against bottle-feeding. After all, she is still breastfeeding her year-old daughter in this picture, a time by which most lesser mothers have abandoned it.)

Gisele attracted much controversy a year or so ago when she announced haughtily that it should be illegal for mothers not to feed their children the way nature intended until they were at least six months old.

'There should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies,' she told a fashion magazine.

At the same time, she chastised women for getting fat while pregnant: 'I think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals. I was mindful about what I ate and I gained only  30 pounds (just over 2st).'

Not that putting on weight has ever really been an issue for the impossibly svelte Gisele. She told Vogue magazine that after the birth of her first child Benjamin, now four, she regained her figure effortlessly and instantly by doing the odd bit of yoga in her living room.

'I think it's muscle memory,' she said carelessly. 'I did kung fu up until two weeks before Benjamin was born, and yoga three days a week.

'It prepared me mentally and physically. It's called “labour” not “holiday” for a reason, and I knew that.'

So much so that she described taking care of her house and husband just 24 hours after giving birth: 'The next day I was walking, I was washing dishes, I was making pancakes in the kitchen.'

As well as her 'muscle memory', Gisele boasts that she's always been an athlete. Born one of six girls in the German-speaking hamlet of Horizontina in southern Brazil, she says she spent her childhood outdoors 'like a little monkey, jumping from tree to tree in bare feet'.

Naturally, she was captain of her school volleyball team and hasn't stopped working with the body God gave her since then.

So devoted is she to her beloved yoga that she recently posed for a picture in which she performed an impossibly bendy stretch, mimicked by her baby daughter.

On the subject of exercise generally, Gisele is scathing about those who train hard, preferring to rely on her natural talents. No aerobics  for her. She declared: 'I think it's better when you're natural, when you just do whatever you want, instead of doing classes where I see all these other people holding back because they've been trained with certain skills or techniques. I'm like, whatever.'

Gisele has also praised her beloved breastfeeding for its weight loss benefits. 'I think breastfeeding really helped,' she said. 'Some people think they don't have to breastfeed. I think: “Are you going to give chemical food to your child, when they are so little?” '

Nor was she any slouch about getting back into shape following the birth of Vivi, her pet name for daughter Vivian, this time last  year. Within weeks, she was photographed looking sensational on holiday in a bikini.

Winding up mothers everywhere: 'I want to have lots of children. It doesn't matter if my body changes'

But, as ever, Gisele managed to wind up mothers everywhere with her comments about the effect babies had on her body.

'I want to have lots of children,' she said. 'It doesn't matter if my body changes. It is the most marvellous thing. For example, they sometimes say that your breasts begin to sag, but I couldn't care less.'

But Gisele's breasts are as pert as ever, despite her protestations.

All of which, one suspects, is enough to make most hard-pressed mothers spit. However, as the latest photo of 'Team Gisele' proves, she has hardly done it without help.

And she can certainly afford the coterie of hired staff who travel the world with her attending to her every whim. For the seventh year, she has been named the world's top-earning supermodel by Forbes magazine.

She raked in an eye-watering £27 million, despite taking time off to have her second child. And if that were not enough, the family coffers were boosted to the tune of another £24 million by the astronomical salary of Miss Bundchen's husband of four years, American football player Tom Brady. In the earning stakes, the power couple even out-rank Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

Meanwhile, Forbes has predicted Gisele is on her way to being the first model to become a dollar billionaire. As well as contracts for fashion chain H&M, Pantene, Oral-B and Sky TV, she is the face of Chanel's Les Beiges make-up and has her own line of lacy underwear, called Gisele Intimates, and range of sandals.

It has bought her and the lantern-jawed Brady, the star quarterback for New England Patriots, an enviable lifestyle. She recently proudly opened up their £12 million, French chateau-style Los Angeles mansion, which has its own moat, to an American magazine.

The holier-than thou model claims the eco-friendly house, which has a gym bigger than an average semi, was built using 90 per cent recycled or antique fittings, and insists the couple grow 85 per cent of their own fruits and vegetables.

And, as we speak, a team of 100 workmen is busily constructing another stunning des res for the couple in upmarket Massachusetts. They also have a home in Brazil and a beachside estate in Costa Rica, where the couple held their lavish wedding celebrations in April 2009.

On that occasion, however, they were not so keen on letting prying eyes in. Paparazzi photographers were confronted by guards, and two of the heavies have been jailed for attempted murder after firing at the snappers, none of whom was hit.

The ever-outspoken Gisele has not always endeared herself to husband's team-mates. Last year, she got into hot water after blaming his fellow players when she was caught on video arguing with rival fans about Brady's performance in a game.

'He didn't catch the ball when he was supposed to catch the ball,' she said of one. 'My husband cannot f****** throw the ball and catch  the ball at the same time. I can't believe they dropped the ball so many times.'

Which is, of course, something Miss Bundchen would never do.

Meanwhile, women have reacted vociferously on the Mail's website to Gisele's latest pictures. One said: 'Honey, you are NOT multitasking. It's your army of stylists, nannies, cleaning ladies, chefs, drivers . .  Ask a mother who has to work a regular job AND be a mother and housewife at the same time.'

Another, called Elaine said: 'Celebrities like Gisele, Gwyneth and others like them really have no awareness whatsoever about how the rest of the world perceives their bragging about a life of wealth and privilege, do they? Quick way to look the utter fool really.'

But perhaps the sharpest comment came from Elly, in Cardiff: 'The word “smug” springs to mind.'
