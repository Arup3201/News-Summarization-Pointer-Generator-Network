An infatuated Royal Air Force officer was jailed yesterday for filming a naked lesbian colleague at their barracks.

Flying Officer Jonathan Cook, 30, sneaked into the woman’s room and hid a video camera under her desk, a court martial was told.

He then retrieved the camera and sent pictures of the unsuspecting nude woman to her girlfriend, using a false name on Facebook, in a bid to destroy their relationship.

'Moment of madness': Flying Officer Jonathan Cook has been given 14 months military detention and been dismissed from the RAF in disgrace after he secretly filmed a colleague in her room at RAF Shawbury

The shamed airman wanted her to believe his victim was having an affair and hoped the pair would split up.

But Cook’s crime was exposed when he gave too much information on the false Facebook profile he had created in the name of ‘Emma Oxbum’.

The female officer confronted him and he admitted being behind the account and taking the video footage.

Police investigated and found images of the woman on his  laptop and mobile phone and several pairs of her underwear in his room.

Yesterday Cook was given 14 months’ military detention after admitting one count of voyeurism and two counts of harassment against the lesbian couple.He was dismissed from the RAF in disgrace.

Cook was based at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire, where helicopter aircrew and instructors and air controllers, including those about to deploy on operations, are trained.

Lieutenant Colonel David Phillips, prosecuting, told the court martial that Cook knew the victim’s daily routine and how she used the communal shower each afternoon.

He entered her room while she was showering to ‘carefully place’ the camera under her desk. It was set to record for 29 minutes and captured her in ‘various states of undress’, the court martial heard.

Lt Col Phillips said: ‘The female officer was, at the time, in a same-sex relationship and that fact was known to the defendant.

‘He had a social relationship with her but the defendant became infatuated with her and this infatuation got to a point where he wanted a relationship with her.

‘He set upon a course of trying to split them up by creating a false female profile on Facebook under the name Emma Oxbum and began sending messages.

‘He started to engage in conversation pretending to be a female interested in both women, sending sexually explicit private messages.

‘He told her partner she had been cheating with other men and women and to back up this point he sent a pixelated naked photo of her over Facebook.’

But Cook, who had served in the RAF since 2010, was unmasked when he mentioned something that was personal and only he and his colleague knew about.

The couple – both in the RAF – said in victim impact statements that the incident had left them close to breaking up.

The woman who Cook recorded on video said: ‘All aspects of my life have been affected. Filming me and stealing my underwear makes me feel violated.’ 

Graham Wallis, defending, told Bulford Court Martial Centre in Wiltshire that Cook ‘deeply regretted’ letting his ‘emotions cloud his professional judgment’ and apologised for a ‘moment of complete madness’.

Sentencing Cook, Judge  Robert Hill said: ‘You became obsessed in starting a relationship with her and became desperate that the chance was slipping away. But this ploy was unravelled when she saw a reference about something only you and her knew about and she smelt a rat.’
