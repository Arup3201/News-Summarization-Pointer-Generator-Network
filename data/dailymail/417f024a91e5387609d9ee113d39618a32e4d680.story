Serial rapist: Brian Witty (above) attacked his third victim, Miss C, at his flat in 2008. He was arrested, but not charged, a decision Miss C said left her feeling scared and suicidal

A victim of a serial rapist jailed indefinitely yesterday was so scared he might return after police released him without charge she slept in her bathroom for a year.

The woman, known only as Miss C, said she chose that room because it was the only one she could lock after being told there was not enough evidence to prosecute former Army captain Brian Witty.

Witty, 41, was convicted of three rapes and one sexual assault over a 15-year period between 1996 and 2011 after meeting his victims online or in bars.

Miss C, his third victim, was attacked in Witty's flat after meeting the ex-Parachute Regiment member for a drink in Richmond in 2008.

She said: 'I was so scared of Brian. He knew where I lived, where I worked. He'd said he was going to kill me that night.

'He held my hand on a hot radiator. The more I said it was hot the more he raped me even harder.'

Miss C, who is in her late 30s, managed to escape, calling 999 and knocking on the doors of neighbouring flats.

But she said she considered suicide after police told her he would not face charges. She subsequently lost her job and has barely worked since.

A court heard Witty, who now works as a City banker, was arrested and questioned after three of the attacks, in 1995, 2006 and the one on Miss C in 2008, but was never charged until after another rape in 2011.

This, the judge said, left Witty believing he was 'untouchable'.

Detectives contacted Miss C last year saying the fourth woman had come forward, but she claims even then they were reluctant to re-open the case.

'The police let him do this,' Miss C is reported as saying in The Guardian.

'It's awful because they're the only people you depend on and they let you down.'

She said the way she was cross-examined during the trial may have put other women off reporting rape.

The defence claimed she had made up her allegation and revealed to the court how she made four 'false' allegations of sexual assault.

She says the allegations were not false, but had simply not gone to court.

A CPS spokesman told The Guardian: 'There are strict rules governing the cross-examination of victims in rape cases.

'In this instance, the prosecution made written and oral submissions and the judge ruled on the appropriate scope of questioning.'

Judge Nicholas Price QC passed an indeterminate sentence for public protection and ordered the former officer spend at least eight years behind bars.

He will only be released when the parole board considers he no longer poses a risk.

Sentencing Witty at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Price told him he was a ‘demanding, frightening and determined rapist’ who hid behind his military background to lure women into a ‘false sense of security.’

Witty was arrested after each of the first three attacks, but it was not until the final attack - in which he raped a 42-year-old woman after meeting her through the website DatingDirect.com - that he was finally charged.

Judge Price said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that you pose a very real danger to women and the only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for public protection.

‘It is clear to me that you set out and prayed on vulnerable women. You hid your base intent behind the veneer of charm and lulled each victim into a false sense of security.

‘Each of them was beguiled into believing that with your military background and apparent social attributes that you were a gentleman and would behave as one.

‘Each of them described, in chilling evidence, your change from plausible and caring into a bullying, self-obsessed, arrogant sexual predator who was determined to indulge in fulfilling your sexual desires irrespective and dismissive of their pleas that you should desist.’

The fact that no action was taken after the first three complaints, he said, led him to feel as though he was ‘untouchable’ by the authorities.

He went on: ‘With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps too easy to say that had you been successfully prosecuted in 1995, you may well not have been free to commit these other, later, serious offences.’

‘It is to the benefits of justice’, he said, ‘that each of your three earlier victims did have the courage to not only make their original complaints but to come before the court so many years later and tell the jury what you had done to them and to relive the traumatic experience.’

The victim impact statements, he said, ‘speaks in harrowing terms of the long-term consequences of your actions on them...it is clear that what you did to each of them has changed their lives immeasurably.

‘It has resulted in distrust, if not fear, of other relationships. It has had adverse consequences on their work and social lives.

‘If anyone ever doubted the devastating long-term consequences of rape or sexual assault, these statements provide eloquent testimony against such doubts. You actions changed forever their lives and the lives of their close family and friends.’

The fact that no initial action was taken ‘led inevitably to feelings of loss of self-worth and despair that they had not been believed’, he said, adding: ‘Justice has been for too long delayed.’

Witty met his first victim, a nanny, in a pub in Fulham in 1995, and when she tried to fight him off at his Kensington flat he told her: ‘I don’t believe this, I’m a good-looking bloke’, before raping her.

A second victim, a 25-year-old recruitment consultant who Witty contacted through DatingDirect.com in May 2006, met him for drinks in Covent Garden.

At the end of the evening he ‘forcefully dragged’ her into a doorway and sexually assaulted her, telling her afterwards: ‘You’re lucky, I don’t usually do that.’

He met the third woman in a City bar in October 2008 where he claimed she was ‘suggestively’ eating a chicken skewer.

They met up for drinks three days later in Richmond before heading back to his riverside flat where he raped her.

Witty’s fourth victim also met him through DatingDirect.com and went back to his flat after a few drinks in Teddington, where he raped her.

Father-of-two Witty, of Twickenham, was given a sentence of six years for the first rape in 1995 to run concurrently with three indeterminate sentence for the two other rapes and sexual assault.

He will serve a minimum of eight years and will sign the sex offenders’ register for life.

Judge Price said he believed there was ‘significant risk to members of the public, by which I mean women, of serious harm occasioned by you.’
