A tanker carrying liquefied natural gas finally docked in Britain yesterday as pressure on energy supplies continued to mount

A giant tanker carrying liquefied natural gas finally docked in Britain yesterday as pressure on energy supplies continued to mount.

The ship reached our shores from Qatar as the threat of the cold snap continuing into April meant the unprecedented spectre of gas rationing continued.

The UK only has enough gas in storage to meet two days of demand after the latest blast of freezing weather led to millions of families turning up their heating higher than is usual for March.

The Government sought to play down concerns over the country’s rapidly depleting gas reserves, insisting that there was no danger of shortages.

Ministers said they were ‘confident’ that there was enough gas available to meet the UK’s needs.

In a desperate attempt to stave off a crisis, measures were taken to boost the volume of gas flowing into the system.

The National Grid said the amount of gas received from North Sea production and imports through pipelines from other parts of Europe had outstripped demand.

This temporary surplus allowed some storage sites to be replenished – providing a cushion against spikes in demand or problems such as pipelines failing in the next few days.

The situation eased further after a large gas tanker ship from the Gulf state of Qatar docked at the Isle of Grain terminal in Medway, Kent, in the early hours of yesterday morning.

The Mekaines was thought to be carrying enough liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet Britain’s needs for 12 hours.

A second tanker, the Zarga,  delivering fuel from Qatar is due to arrive in Milford Haven, South Wales, today and two more vessels – one from Trinidad – are set to dock in the UK later this week.

Price rise: The shortfall is likely to push up the long-term price of gas and could result in household tariffs rising by up to 15 per cent before next winter

Analysts believe they will supply a total of around 430million cubic metres of gas – compared with current daily demand of around 350million cubic metres.

Energy Minister John Hayes has played down shortage fears

The crisis deepened on Friday when an undersea pipeline connecting Britain and Belgium shut down without warning – pushing the price of gas up by 50 per cent to a record high of 150p a therm, up from Thursday’s price of 100p.

Ofgem, the energy regulator, said: ‘While gas supplies are tight at the moment and there is no room for complacency, Britain does benefit from a diverse range of gas supplies and National Grid has many tools to manage the system and to prevent householders’ supplies from being disrupted.’

If rationing is needed, businesses and power stations will be restricted first, but then householders will be ordered to cut down on the amount of gas they use for heating their homes.

Energy Minister John Hayes said: ‘As the cold weather continues, the UK’s gas needs continue to be met.

‘We get our supplies from a diverse range of sources and the market is proving to be highly responsive to the UK’s needs.

‘We are never complacent, but National Grid are confident that the situation today is stable and as expected.’
