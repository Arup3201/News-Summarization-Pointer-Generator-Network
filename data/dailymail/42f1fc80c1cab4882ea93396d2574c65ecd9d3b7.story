London schoolgirl Hanni Blaskey has given the BBC’s Children In Need appeal a £30,000 head start - by quizzing the rich and famous on the secret of happiness.

Her book, featuring the words of more than 100 celebrities, among them the Duchess of York and David Cameron, was snapped up by Sainsbury’s and has already topped their sales chart.

But the simple pleasures revealed in What Makes Me Happy aren't quite as lavish as you might expect, with children, dogs, food and scenery all favourites.

Sunshine and fairies: The Duchess of York cited both - and magic - in her response to Hanni Blaskey

Family man: David Cameron, pictured with his wife Samantha, said that his family made him the happiest

Comedian Michael McIntyre cites 'children in the morning when they haven’t woken up to misbehave' while BBC presenter Gaby Roslin plumps for 'my kids, my husband and a hot bath'.

Ed Miliband and David Cameron also cited spending time with their children as the secret of happiness and so, in what is possibly the first time he has agreed with either party leader, did UKIP's Nigel Farage.

Among the dog lovers is Andy Murray, who admits he badly misses his when away on the circuit because '…they don’t care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.'

'Walking my dog makes me happy,' adds Gary Lineker. 'His utter joy at the word "walkies" never diminishes. Such enthusiasm for something so simple is strangely satisfying.’

And Imelda Staunton writes: 'Walking very early in the mornings during the summer with my little dog – either on the Heath or by the sea…heaven.'

Naughty: Comedian Michael McIntyre said his children... but only when they're asleep and not misbehaving

Dog fans: Both Andy Murray and John Bishop spoke of how their pet dogs made them happy

Unusual: Nicole Scherzinger  presented her happiness as a flow chart which unexpectedly included yodelling

But not everyone chose children - or dogs - as the inspiration for their happiest moments. Rocker Rod Stewart revealed that a cup of tea makes him 'uncontrollably happy', while Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger chose, rather unexpectedly, yodelling.

The Duchess of York told the schoolgirl that her idea of happiness involved sunny mornings before, rather bizarrely, going on to add: 'I do believe in fairies.

'I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes.

'Don't let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic.' 

Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman says that for him it’s: 'Eating a bacon sandwich. Sleeping in the chair. Being nice on Strictly. Getting out of bed and nothing falls off.'

Contribution: Rod Stewart spoke of his love for tea while Gary Barlow opted out of writing and sent doodles 

Music: Both Dizzee Rascal and Cerys Matthews cited music - albeit of wildly different kinds

Richard Madeley, who has a home in Cornwall, wrote back to 13-year-old Hanni: ‘Being up early enough to see the sun rise over Talland Bay in Cornwall. Nearest thing to paradise on earth.’

Some celebrities strayed from their brief to try and define how the feeling comes over them, with Maureen Lipman writing that 'happiness is released like a kind of gas from a rock.'

Meanwhile there were some, like Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, who weren't quite embrace the theme.

‘The rare occasion when I check my diary and there’s nothing in it for the next hour,’ he replied.

Hanni, from Hampstead, North London, got her idea after watching a harrowing Children In Need documentary about a young girl caring for her bedbound mother.

‘I just wondered aloud what would make her happy,’ she said. ‘I thought I’d ask famous people because everyone identifies with them. It was an amazing response.’

Family: Like David Cameron, Ed Miliband agreed that family was the thing that made him happiest

Agreed: And in a rare instance of Nigel Farage agreeing with Cameron and Miliband, he also said family

Choices: Martin Clunes chose horses while Simon Mayo chose weather. Katherine Jenkins chose everything

Popular options: Like Clare Balding and Will Carling, most of those asked opted for either their dogs or families

'She got the idea when Rick, her dad, suggested she raise money for Children In Need herself rather than just grab his credit card,' explained her delighted mother Simone.

'We’re very proud of her. It was a lot of hard work.’

And Hanni’s personal recipe for happiness? 'It makes me very happy to see my book on sale,’ she said.

'But also when my dad’s football team Sheffield Wednesday avoids losing. Things are pretty glum around our house otherwise.'

Contribution: Sir Paul McCartney told Hanni that his family - grandchildren in particular - were most important

DAVID CAMERON

'On a personal level, my own happiness index is very easy to explain: it is all about my family. Whether it is the everyday routines I go through with Samantha and the children; taking my youngest daughter Florence to nursery; helping Nancy complete her homework; or watching Elwen play football and rugby, I am happiest when I am with those I love the most and enjoying quality time with them.'

THE DUCHESS OF YORK 

'Your eyes open and the life is a fresh, new day, the sunlight nudges through the curtains. I do believe in fairies. I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes. Don't let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic. That makes me happy, as every day is, therefore, a day of exploration and adventure.'

SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH

'The sun rising in the mountains makes me happy.'

DIZZEE RASCAL

'Bass! Lots of bass!!!'

ANDY MURRAY

'Spending time at home with my girlfriend and our two dogs! I travel six months every year and miss being with my dogs a lot. So much so that I have travelled with them to some tournaments! They don't care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.'

ED MILIBAND

'My family is the most important thing in the world to me so spending time with my wife Justine and my boys Daniel and Sam is what always makes me happy.'

NIGEL FARAGE

'Being with my four healthy children and thinking about how lucky we all are compared to many. This is a time to think about others less fortunate than ourselves.'

CLARE BALDING

'Walking my dog Archie every day. Whatever the weather, he makes me smile and we explore the world together.'

PALOMA FAITH

'What makes me happy is the kindness of strangers.'

BORIS JOHNSON

'Sitting in the sun and trying to paint the view, or possibly, a person.'

ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER

'My family, good wine, good musicals and my Turkish Van cats.' 

SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY

'What makes me happy is to have a weekend off from my travels and my concerts and spend it with my family. I love to hear the noises in the kitchen as the meal is prepared and then my little grandson climbs on my knee and requests a bite for every bite that I take. There's nothing better to enjoy than having my wife, kids and grandkids around on a lazy weekend.'
