Friends were paying tribute last night to five members of the same family – including a toddler – who died in a car crash on their way to a dancing competition.

David and Angela Cockburn, their daughters Carley, 21, and Bethany, 18, and Bethany’s 23-month-old daughter Lacie died when their Nissan Primera car collided with a lorry.

Tragic: Bethany Cockburn and her 23-month-old daughter Lacie Jade Stephenson (pictured with Bethany's boyfriend) were among the five members of the same family who were killed in the crash

Horror: The family's Nissan Primera covered up next to the lorry following the fatal crash that killed five people

Tributes: Flowers are left outside the Cockburn family home in Chester-Le-Street, County Durham

Family: It emerged today the family were on their way to Butlin's in Skegness to take part in a dance competition

The crash happened near Grimsby as the family, from Ouston, County Durham, drove towards the Butlins holiday camp at Skegness, where Carley and Bethany were due to take part in a disco-dancing competition.

Three of the family died at the scene and the other two later in hospital.

The driver of the light goods vehicle is thought to have suffered minor injuries. Lacie’s soldier father, Garry Stephenson – who was not in the car – had recently returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan with the Scots Guards.

Friends said yesterday that he was devoted to his girlfriend and baby daughter who he referred to as his ‘gorgeous girl’ on his Facebook page.

Crash: Three people were pronounced dead at the scene, the two remaining passengers died at hospital

Scene: The head-on collision between the family's car and the light goods vehicle occurred at 12.30pm today on Barton Street, Grimsby

Melanie Willis, a family friend from Newcastle, said the close-knit 
former mining area where the family lived had been left ‘devastated’. A 
tribute page on Facebook attracted more than 10,000 followers within 
hours of being set up.

‘They are a lovely family –  they were so popular and you could not wish
to know nicer people,’ said Ms Willis. ‘Angela and David were devoted 
to their children and to their granddaughter.’

‘It is so sad that as a family they had made that journey using that 
route to Skegness many, many times since the girls were little.’

Mrs Cockburn ran a sunbed and beauty shop in a Newcastle suburb while Mr
Cockburn worked for Gateshead Council supporting people with learning 
disabilities.

It is understood that the couple’s surviving son, Dean, is being 
supported by specially trained family liaison officers from Humberside 
Police.

In 2011 the Grimsby stretch of the A18, where the crash happened, 
featured in a BBC programme, Britain’s Most Dangerous Roads, when it was
claimed to be 25 times more dangerous than the average British 
motorway.
