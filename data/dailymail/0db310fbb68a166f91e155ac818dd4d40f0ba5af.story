Arsene Wenger’s defensive injury crisis deepened on Monday night leaving him to consider plunging untried teenager Hector Bellerin into Arsenal’s Champions League game at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night.

Right back Bellerin, 19, has made only one appearance for the club, as a late substitute in a Capital One Cup tie against West Brom last season, but may be asked to start in Dortmund’s intimidating Westfalenstadion.

Nacho Monreal did not travel to Germany because of a back problem, Calum Chambers is suffering from tonsilitis and is rated ‘50-50’ and Mathieu Debuchy faces two months out after damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester City on Saturday.

If Chambers is not fit to start, Wenger can turn to Spain Under 19 international Bellerin, who spent last season on loan at Watford, or switch Mathieu Flamini from midfield. Kieran Gibbs will come in for Monreal at left back.

Wenger said: 'I don't feel we are stretched. The Debuchy injury put us in a position where we do not want more and hopefully we have good news after the scan today that he can be back soon.

'We have Chambers who can play in different positions, Monreal who can play centre-back and (Hector) Bellerin, who I think now is ready to play.

'He (Bellerin) is a boy with personality. He's not fazed by the pressure. That's important when you're a young boy. His transitional game is fantastic.

'He's quick and his final ball is good. He lacks a bit of experience but he's very dangerous.'  

Alexis Sanchez has scored in his last three games for the Gunners and looks likely to start on Tuesday

Jack Wilshere played exceptionally against Manchester City and will be hoping to continue that form

Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund side are the obvious threat to Arsenal in Group D of the Champions League, and Wenger believes German and Spanish sides will be strong in the competition once again this season.

'The main threats will be the German and Spanish team,' he continued.

'Look at the times Bayern has been in the final. There's no obvious reason why they should not be there again.

'Dortmund have been a regular participant and the two big clubs in Spain will be main contenders again.

'I have great respect for Mr Klopp. He rose up very quickly in his career and inspired Dortmund. What does he do better than me? Maybe a lot of things. But I love to see his squad playing dynamic and attractive football. I like it.'  

Arsene Wenger hands out instructions to his players as they prepare for Tuesday's clash with Dortmund

Following a 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emirates on Saturday, Arsenal can take positives into the clash with Dortmund.

Danny Welbeck had a promising debut despite being unable to find the net and Jack Wilshere was particularly impressive.

But Wenger is cautious about using all his German World Cup-winning players from the start, believing Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski are not yet fully match fit. 

Wenger said: 'The (World Cup) final in Rio was July 13. They came back on the August 11. That means I gave them one month of holiday.

'It was important for me that they would recover. They have been training for one month and haven't reached 100 per cent physically yet but they're close.'
