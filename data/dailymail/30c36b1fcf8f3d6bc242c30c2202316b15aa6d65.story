If you thought your Christmas decorations were the ones to beat this year, look away now.

With 100,000 lights choreographed to a five-minute medley of Star Wars songs played by the London Symphony Orchestra, Tom BetGeorge has categorically put everyone in the world to shame.

More than three million people have watched the video in just a few days. 

Incredible: Tom BetGeorge transformed his Bay Area bungalow into a Star Wars-themed 100,000-light show

Dramatic: The five-minute show synchronizes the lights to John Williams' compositions to tell the story

And if those figures don't sound convincing, have a look for yourself.

BetGeorge worked for two months crafting handmade props and wiring 12,500 channels around his humble bungalow in Bay Area, California.

For every minute of music, he spent 10 hours programming. 

He then dedicated his time to synchronizing each flash of light to tell the story of George Lucas' blockbuster - complete with light saber sound effects.

Good cause: BetGeorge spent two months manufacturing the stunt to raise money for his local church

Keen to keep it fresh, BetGeorge has also prepared a light show using the same display for songs including Let It Go from Frozen and Daft Punk by Pentatonix, he told the Guardian.

As the elaborate stunt was built to raise money for his local church, Centerville Presbyterian, BetGeorge said his gracious neighbors have been surprisingly supportive.

Posting a high-quality video of the five-minute light show on YouTube, he wrote: 'Here's my tribute to my favorite songs on Star Wars! 

'The neighbors are very supportive especially since I use the display to raise money for the poor and homeless through my church. 

Painstaking: For every minute of music, he spent 10 hours programming the colorful lights and sound effects

'A lot of people have been asking about how to donate to my church's free dining program online - if that's on your heart, please use this link and God bless!'

The reaction, he insists, has been humbling.

'Honestly, it’s a little surreal. It’s humbling. I anticipated that a lot of people [would] like ‘Star Wars,’ but I didn’t expect it to blow up like that,' he told Yahoo News.
