New Zealand's Aaron Cruden reveals all about his career so far. From quality coffee, Bora Bora and Denzel Washington to Muhammad Ali, the 2011 World Cup win and wanting to be a black cab driver...

New Zealand's Aaron Cruden reveals all about his career so far before the Autumn internationals

Who is your sporting hero?

Muhammad Ali. The way he was able to stay at the top of his sport and profession for so long, while facing so much adversity, is really impressive. Sonny Bill Williams and Liam Messam, two of my team-mates, have tried out boxing but it’s never crossed my mind to get in the ring. It would be pretty daunting!

What would you be if you weren't a sportsman?

When I left school I worked as a barista in a cafe. There aren’t too many cappuccino drinkers back home — I sharpened my skills on a latte or a flat white! I was always into PE at school and I enjoyed English as well.

Career highlight?

The 2011 World Cup win. I got the call-up late because of an injury but it was really special to win it in our home country.

Like many, Muhammad Ali is Cruden's sporting hero, but he has never tried boxing

And the worst moment?

Probably that World Cup final because it was a little bittersweet. I had to go off after about 30 minutes with an injury. I hyper-extended my knee and that was the end of my game.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

Is it a bit boring to say an All Blacks jersey? Maybe an All Blacks jersey and a spare pair of undies, because you never know when they could come in handy.

What’s the best advice you've ever been given?

It’s a bit of a cliche but you’ve always got to chase your dreams and follow your heart. If you’re eager to achieve something don’t let anyone tell you any different. That’s what my good old mum told me and it’s kept me in pretty good stead.

Last film you saw?

It was Man on Fire that stars Denzel Washington. It’s an old one but a goodie. I watched it on the flight to Chicago from New Zealand. Some of the taller boys struggle to sleep on planes but I find it quite luxurious with the space we get.

Bora Bora in the French Polynesia is the New Zealand fly-half's favourite holiday destination

Favourite pre-match meal?

I have some mashed spuds with baked beans, poached eggs, avocado and chicken. It generally stays the same and it’s usually cooked for us in the hotel. That’s what I would have on game day.

Your favourite holiday destination?

Bora Bora near Tahiti is an amazing place. It’s part of the French Polynesian islands and is about a seven-hour flight from New Zealand. It really is a beautiful part of the world, surrounded by a reef.

In a film of your life, who would you like to play you?

Denzel Washington would be pretty cool. He’s a bit of a dude and you never see him in a bad movie. I don’t see myself as a cool dude but he is, so I’ll pick him!

Tell us a secret...

If I tell you it’s not really a secret is it?! My mum doesn’t do my washing or anything like that. I was lying about what job I wanted to do when I was younger — I actually wanted to be a black-cab driver in London!

If you are planning a trip to Bora Bora like Aaron, make sure you are covered with AIG travel insurance. AIG are the Official Insurance Partner of New Zealand Rugby.
