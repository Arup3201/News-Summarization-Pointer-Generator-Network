A Canadian investment tycoon is emerging as a frontrunner in the bidding to take over BlackBerry.

Prem Watsa - often regarded as Canada's Warren Buffett - is thought to be one of the leading bidders for the struggling smartphone company which has just put itself up for sale.

The head of Fairfax Financial Holdings was on BlackBerry’s board until he resigned on Monday citing a conflict of interests.

The 61-year-old is the company’s biggest shareholder – believed to have spent £570 million buying ten per cent of the company’s shares – and he is now expected to try and organise BlackBerry’s exit from the stockmarket.

Mr Watsa moved to Canada, from his home in India, with just $8 to his name and built his fortune supporting supposedly lost causes – such as the Bank of Ireland, The Guardian reports.

The tycoon’s company currently has a stockmarket value of $9 billion.

‘Hearing the announcement from BlackBerry accompanied by Prem's departure from the board should indicate something will happen this time on the strategic front,’ Todd Johnson, a portfolio manager at Winnipeg-based BCV Financial, which owns Fairfax debt, told The Guardian.

Mr Watsa’s interest in BlackBerry is thought to be the first sign of a monetary solution to the company’s problems.

‘We believe Fairfax along with other Canadian pension funds and banks are considering taking BlackBerry private,’ Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies bank, told The Guardian.

Mr Watsa is said to view BlackBerry 
as having a number of valuable assets, including its famous brand name, 
its ‘huge’ patent portfolio and its 76 million subscribers.

Some of the world's largest private 
equity firms, including Bain Capital LLC, KKR & Co LP and Carlyle 
Group LP, are also expected to look at BlackBerry when the company 
launches a sale process.

Leo De Bever, the chief executive of Alberta Investment Management Corp, said he expected some of the largest Canadian pension funds, including his own, to look at any potential deals for the company.

Analysts said firms ranging from established mobile phone players like Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co to technology giants like Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM Corp, may also be drawn to the beleaguered smartphone maker's assets.

BlackBerry revolutionised mobile phone technology but its popularity was badly dented by the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 and has since lost out to Android phones as well as Microsoft's Windows device

Dismal second quarter results sent the company's share price tumbling in June as sales of its new smartphones working the new BlackBerry 10 operating system failed to meet expectations

BlackBerry has seen its market value 
nosedive to around $5.7 billion from more than $80 billion at its peak 
in 2008, as its latest BlackBerry 10 devices struggle to challenge an 
onslaught from the iPhone and devices running Google Inc's Android 
operating system.

The handset revolutionised mobile phone technology when it was introduced in 1999 but its popularity was badly dented by the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 and has since lost out to Android phones as well as Microsoft's Windows device.

BlackBerry chief executive Thorsten Heins
said that there were still 'compelling long-term opportunities' for 
its new phones and it was pursuing cost-cutting, efficiency and the 
launch of new technology.

Since it started to struggle, BlackBerry has had to cut more than 5,000 jobs, and shareholder wealth has declined by more than $70 billion.
