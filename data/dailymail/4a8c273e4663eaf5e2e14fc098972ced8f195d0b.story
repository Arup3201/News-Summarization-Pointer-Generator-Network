Zachariah Grisham is being held on preliminary charges of reckless homicide and neglect of a dependant after blasting Lance Wilson in the head

A three-year-old was killed after his mother's boyfriend shot him apparently during a game that went badly wrong.

Zachariah Grisham, of Michigan City, Indiana, is being held on preliminary charges of reckless homicide and neglect of a dependant after blasting Lance Wilson in the head.

Police said Grisham, the live-in boyfriend of Lance's mother, was at home playing a shooting game with the youngster when he reached for his pistol.

Grisham, who appeared in court to face charges yesterday, has said he didn't realise the weapon was loaded.

LaPorte County Prosecutor Bob Szilagyi said Grisham and Lance often played a game where the boy would point his finger and say, 'bang bang'.

Grisham would play along by pointing his actual gun at Lance and pulling the trigger. This time, however, there was a bullet loaded into the chamber.

Police arrived at around 3.30pm on Sunday to find the boy dead inside the trailer where he lived with Grisham, his mother and at least one other child.

He had suffered a single gunshot wound to the head.

An account of the killing was given to officials by the boy's mother and Grisham, who is being held in La Porte County jail on a $100,000 bond.

Sue Holloway, a neighbour of the family, told how she ended up comforting the mother after she saw several police vehicles and an ambulance outside their home.

'She had blood on her hands,' Ms Holloway told nwitimes.com. 'I felt so bad that this happened. A sweet little innocent boy is gone.'

Another neighbour, Kim Vansickle, told ABC News: 'As an adult, you should know better than to play a game with a three-year-old with a gun. You never know what could happen.

'And in this case, it went off and a little boy had to die.'

The trailer park community where the tragedy happened. Police arrived at around 3.30pm on Sunday to find the boy dead inside the trailer where he lived with Grisham, his mother and at least one other child

Locals said the family had recently moved into the community. Court documents seen by nwitimes.com indicate that Grisham has a criminal record dating back to 2003.

Neighbours and officials have said the tragic case is an example of why the utmost care must be taken when handling guns.

Detective Sergeant Andy Hynek of La Porte County Sheriff's Department said: 'When you pull the trigger at the wrong time, wrong situation, you can't bring somebody back.'
