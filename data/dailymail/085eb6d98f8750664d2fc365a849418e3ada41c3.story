The family of murdered soldier Lee Rigby cheered on members of his regiment yesterday as they took part in a charity truck pull.

Fusilier Rigby was killed in a brutal attack in the street outside Woolwich Barracks in south east London in May.

Yesterday, his widow, Rebecca, and their two-year-old son, Jack, cheered on members of the barracks who took part in a fundraiser in Medbourne, Leicestershire.

Mrs Rigby said: 'It's been a great day and there's a great turnout.'
