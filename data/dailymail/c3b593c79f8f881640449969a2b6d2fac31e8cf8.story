Heavy snow has turned many areas in Scotland into a real winter wonderland.

The white stuff can be seen stretching for miles in this video shot in Stirling, central Scotland.

The Met Office has issued an amber ‘be prepared’ alert in central and southern Scotland, with the rest of Britain on yellow 'be aware' alert. 

Even the most adventurous among us would find hiking around East Biggs somewhat challenging

In this video, the red traffic sign stands out beautifully against the blanket-like landscape, which wouldn't be suitable even for the hardest of hikers.

The wintry blast took effect in Scotland yesterday, forcing the closure of more than 30 schools in the Highlands and creating difficult driving conditions.

The outline of the traffic sign clashes quite nicely with the blanket-white landscape of snow

The snow has forced the police to urge motorists to avoid dangerous areas and only drive if necessary

Road operator Bear Scotland said its teams were working around the clock to keep routes clear, while Police Scotland said drivers should ask whether their journey is really necessary before getting behind the wheel.

Chief Inspector Louise Blakelock said: 'If you do decide to travel, ensure your vehicle is well prepared before setting off, make sure your windscreens are completely free of snow and ice, and your lights are working and clean.'

Scholls were closed throughout Scotland as the country continued to experience the cold snap

'A few reports of cars slipping and at least one jack-knifed lorry. No injuries so far thankfully. Please take care out there.'

In the Highlands and Islands 98 schools and nurseries have been shut while eight in Perth and Kinross and five in Shetland have been closed.

ScotRail said that no trains would operate from 6pm yesterday until 6pm today on the Helensburgh to Dumbarton Central, Kilwinning to Largs/Ardrossan, Kyle to Dingwall and Glasgow to Fort William/Mallaig/Oban routes.
