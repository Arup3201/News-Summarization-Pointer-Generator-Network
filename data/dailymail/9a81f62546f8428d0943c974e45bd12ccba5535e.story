Sam Allardyce has revealed all talk about his new contract will hold until the end of the season as the West Ham manager as questions remain as to whether he will remain in charge of the club.

The 60-year-old is in the final year of his contract and there has been speculation that the Blackburn manager would be leaving the club, bringing to an end a four-year tenure at Upton Park.

Allardyce has always struggled to win over large sections of the West Ham support, who feel his playing style does not fit with the traditions of the club.

But Allardyce will sit down with the owners when the season is over as, he says, is the usual way of doing things under owners David Sullivan and David Gold.

'The owners are no different now to what they have been in my entire time here,' Allardyce told Talksport on Friday moring.

'Waiting until the season, as they did last time when we first got back in the premier league and finished 10th, that was sorted out at the end of the season, and it will be the same for this contract.'

Allardyce led the Hammers to promotion from the Championship during his first season in charge before 10th and 13th place finish in the Premier League.

An attempted change in style and an assault on Europe this season seems to have gone a certain way to appeasing supporters but Allardyce only ever appears one defeat from criticism.
