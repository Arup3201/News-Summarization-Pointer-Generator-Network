Switched off: The lamps in Ashford, Kent, had been extinguished to cut costs (file photo)

When a series of cars were broken into in quick succession, victims were quick to dial 999 to call for help.

And the police were soon on the case, using dogs to hunt the culprit before bravely giving chase when a suspect was seen running away.

Until, that is, the manhunt was abruptly called off – because it was ‘too dark’ for it to continue.

Last night it was still not clear whether the officers were scared of the dark, or concerned about the risk of tripping.

But angry local residents said it was ridiculous that a criminal had been allowed to escape when they were on the verge of being caught red-handed.

The incident took place in Ashford, Kent in the early hours of Saturday a fortnight ago.

Residents called the police after they discovered somebody had broken into several cars and swiped wallets, electrical gadgets, designer sunglasses and a mountain bike.

Officers from Kent Police immediately responded and arrived with dogs to track down the thief.

They managed to catch sight of a suspect – but he was able to escape after officers decided it was too dark to pursue him on foot. A statement from a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who was briefed by police blamed a new streetlight switch-off scheme which is meant to save the council £1million a year.

The statement read: ‘A figure was chased but due to the light switch-off it was almost impossible for officers to search the area effectively and no one was detained.’

Growing areas of Britain are seeing streetlamps switched off at night by cost-cutting councils, despite fears that the measure will lead to a rise in crime.

A survey suggested two-thirds of councils were either dimming street lights or turning them off to cut bills. Around 750,000 lights in 81 local authority areas are thought to be involved in the switch-off.

Kent county council launched its Safe and Sensible lighting scheme a few months ago, saying 70,000 street lights would be turned off between midnight and 5.30am.

But residents of the Little Burton estate said the measure has left them feeling unsafe at night.

Kelsey Lapthorn, 42, said: ‘There are places that were safe where you just can’t go now after the lights are off. It’s pitch black up there and people just don’t feel safe.

‘I’m getting security lights fitted today and I know a number of my neighbours are thinking about doing the same.’

A council spokesman said: ‘We continue to work closely with police to monitor crime. We will review the lighting requirements if any increase can be attributed to the absence of street lighting.’

And a police spokesman added: ‘It is too early in the scheme to give any indication as to whether the reduction on lighting levels has impacted on crime.’

They were unable to say whether the officers involved were afraid of the dark.
