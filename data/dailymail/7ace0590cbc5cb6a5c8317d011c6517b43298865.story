Anyone wanting to live in Britain's most expensive new build property on 'Billionaire's row' will need more than the Help to Buy scheme after it was put on the market for £22 million.

Fairways is an eight-bedroom mansion tucked away off The Bishops Avenue, a north London road known as Billionaires' Row due to the enormous neighbouring properties, some of which are owned by celebrities, wealthy business people and members of the Saudi royal family.

After 18 months, work on the new high specification home is now complete, with the luxury accommodation spread over a staggering 17,000 square foot.

Location location: Fairways, which is one of Britain's most expensive new build homes, is located on The Bishop's Avenue in north London, dubbed Billionaire's Row

Lounge: This sitting room looks out onto the house's sprawling garden, which backs onto the Highgate Golf Course, should a new owner fancy a round

Pricey: At £22million, he buyer will have to pay more than £1.5 million in stamp duty, while Fairways is not eligible for the Government's Help to Buy scheme

Music to your ears: After 18 months, work on the new high specification home is now complete, with the luxury accommodation spread over a staggering 17,000 square foot

Built by luxury developer Albany Homes, the double-fronted mansion boasts eight bedroom suites, a private detached guesthouse, large garden and a leisure complex likened to those found in a 'seven-star hotel'.

They have put in on the market with Glentree Estates for £22 million - making it one of the largest and most expensive new builds in the world.

At this price, the buyer will have to pay more than £1.5 million in stamp duty, while Fairways is not eligible for the Government's Help to Buy scheme - which normally offers buyers the chance to buy a new build or existing property with just a five percent deposit.

Time for tea: This opulent dining room will easily seat 10 for dinner, while the house's garage can hold four cars

Blockbuster: Film buffs won't need to travel to the local multiplex if they want to catch the latest releases as they can watch in style from the comfort of this cinema room

Making a splash: The swimming pool forms part of a leisure complex which has been likened to those found in a 'seven-star hotel'

The Bishops Avenue, in East Finchley, north London, was last year ranked as the second most expensive street in Britain and as one of London's most illustrious addresses is a favourite for foreign royalty, oligarchs and celebrities.

Neighbours include Kazakh property mogul Horelma Peramam, and members of the Saudi royal family, while the Sultan of Brunei also reportedly owns a property nearby.

Former residents on the 66 house avenue have included industrialist Lakshmi Mittal, Sir Billy Butlin, Dame Gracie Fields, George Sainsbury, son of the supermarket founder, sugar mogul William Lyle, Katie Boyle, Moustrap producer Sir Peter Saunders, businessmen Asil Nadir and Emil Savundra, and Heather Mills once owned an apartment on the street.

Lulu, Ringo Starr, Sting, George Michael, Salman Rushdie and Annie Lennox are also among those who once called the exclusive street home.

However, earlier this year it was reported that many of the expensive properties on the road are lying empty, with an estimated 120 bedrooms in the street unused - as Britain faces a housing shortage growing by more than 100,000 homes a year.

Among the empty buildings are a row of 10 mansions which are believed to be falling into disrepair after they were bought in the late 1980s and early 1990s but have never been lived in. They are believed to have recently been sold with the aim of turning them into flats.

Many of the homes are owned by off-shore companies.

Lounging: If swimming and going to the gym gets too much, the leisure complex also provides a pace to relax underneath a huge skylight

Seating area: This airy spot behind the pool is also a relaxing place to sit, while those in search of a little more excitement can take a trip to the dance floor - which accomodates 200 guests

Stairway to heaven: This stunning glass staircase runs down to the home's luxury pool area

Routes: A winding staircase connects the eight bedrooms of the sprawling property to the rest of the house, while a glass stairwell runs to the basement

Trevor Abrahamsohn, who has sold more than £3 billion of houses in the area, has been instructed to sell Fairways.

He said: 'It is a lovely 17,000sq/ft home with a pool and leisure centre which is seven-star hotel quality.

'A lot of wealthy people like their homes to be close to an iconic road like The Bishops Avenue but also set back so they get greater privacy.

'Fairways is in a leafy enclave and it backs onto Highgate Golf Course.

'Why should someone buy it? It is a cross between a country home and a townhouse, nestled between two medieval villages.

Reflections: This mirrored entrance hall and multi-storey atrium makes for an impressive sight upon entering the mansion through the large double oak doors

Studious: Estate agents say that some of London's finest schools are 'on the doorstep', and the centre of London is just ten minutes away

Scrubs up well: One of the bedrooms boasts this huge marble-clad bathroom, which comes complete with a deluxe shower, two sinks and even a bidet

'The finest schools are on your doorstep, there are two golf courses within walking distance and the centre of London just ten minutes away.

'It all comes at the quarter of the price of a home in Kensington.'

Fairways has been designed to 'deliver the wow factor upon arrival' and after entering through the large double oak doors, people are greeted by the main entrance hall which has a multi-storey atrium.

The mansion boasts art deco fireplaces, a 16-seater dining room and fully-fitted Poggenpohl kitchen.

Spacious: The house's master bedroom has been decorated in stylish cream with red velvet accents, and occupies the same amount of space as a one-bedroom flat

En suite: The master bedroom leads on to this opulent cream marble bathroom suite, which rivals those found in many top hotels

All mod cons: For those who can't bear to miss out on their favourite shows, this bathroom also has a television screen attached to the wall

All eight bedrooms come with en-suite bathrooms with the master bedroom occupying the same amount of space as a one-bedroom flat.

There is an enormous gym which occupies the lower ground floor and runs underneath the house and garden.

A dance floor can accommodate up to 200 guests and there is a garage - serviced by a turning table - which can hold four cars.

Barry Angel, managing director of Albany Homes, said: 'Fairways is a grand mansion, situated on one of London's most expensive addresses, set off the avenue and enjoying luscious green surroundings, offering a fantastic turn-key opportunity to discerning buyers who require a prime property, with a private setting, providing a convenient route into central London.'
