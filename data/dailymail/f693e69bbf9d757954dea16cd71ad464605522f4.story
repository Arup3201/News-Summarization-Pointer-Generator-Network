A handwritten copy of a manifesto dubbed the 'diary of death', which was put together by White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite, reveals a terrifying code of conduct for her 'holy warriors'.

Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire – the world’s most wanted woman – has been on the run since December 2011 after being linked to a plan to bomb luxury tourist resorts in the Kenyan coastal resort of Mombasa.

The daughter of a British soldier has also been linked to last month’s horrific terror attack on a Nairobi shopping mall, which killed more than 70 people.

The mother-of-four is subject of an international manhunt by nearly 200 countries after she was named in a Red Alert by Interpol following the atrocity in Nairobi, which was carried out by gunmen linked to the Al Shabaab terror group.

A copy of her manifesto transcribed into English by one her recruits reveals her plans to wage war on westerners.

The five-pages of notes were found among belongings of bomb-maker Hassan Omondi in a safe house used by Al Shabaab terrorists in Mombasa, Kenya. 

In the book, the young recruit writes: 'Element of surprise - You need this to get victory.

'Surprising the enemy is half of the war. This surprise is a result of proper intelligence.'

Samantha Lewthwaite penned a 34-line poem to Osama bin Laden and promised to continue his fight

The code of conduct highlights seven qualities every soldier must have. They are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honour, integrity and courage.' 

Bizarrely, another section encourages her disciples to treat others with dignity and respect.

It also advises that any work carried out must be based on strong intelligence otherwise it will fail.

'Like a building, if the foundations are not strong and you want to build on it you will bring it down,' it reads.

The manual is believed to have been transcribed by a man called Ormondi Budalangi, also known as Zain.

Lewthwaite met Ormondi at a mosque in Mombasa and put him forward for special training.

However, he was killed during a police raid in Mombasa in October 2012.

A security source told The Mirror: 'The manifesto is a book of death and destruction. The security community is working day and night to find Lewthwaite and bring a stop to her evil empire.'

Yesterday pictures emerged of Lewthwaite that showed a double life of the British Muslim convert - as both a loving mother and an Islamic terrorist plotting atrocities against Western targets.

The family pictures, taken in July 2010, and discovered by British anti-terrorist investigators on a discarded computer in Kenya, reveal Lewthwaite’s softer side, but locked in the hard-drive of the laptop aofficers made more chilling discoveries.

They found Lewthwaite had spent eight years researching bomb-making and searching for the deadly chemicals used to make improvised explosives devices.

And they discovered a poem she wrote, praising the ideology of Al Qaeda mastermind Osama Bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan by US troops in May 2011.

Typed clumsily after his death, Lewthwaite proclaims her love for the terrorist chief.

She wrote: ‘Oh Sheik Osama my father, my brother / My love for you is like no other / Oh Sheik Osama now that you are gone / The Muslims must wake up they must be strong.’

The family photos were taken while 
Lewthwaite was living in South African, working in a halal pie factory 
under the false name of Natalie Faye Webb.

She
is believed to have moved to Kenya in 2007, just months after she 
condemned the deadly role her husband Lindsay played in the 7/7 London 
bombings that killed 52.

She
moved to South Africa in 2008 and adopted the identity of an 
unsuspecting young woman who had moved to the UK with her parents as a 
baby.

The Briton later fled the country, through Tanzania, establishing a base in Mombasa, Kenya, where she is believed to have become a senior figure in Al Shabaab.

Lewthwaite went into hiding in December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when she was arrested following a raid on an Al Shabaab cell.

Her British accomplice Jermaine Grant, from London, is on trial in Kenya for terrorist offences.

Her second husband Habib Ghani  28, from Hounslow, Middlesex, was killed in a gun battle in Somalia last month after falling out with senior Al Shabaab members.

He had called himself Osama al-Britani.

Lewthwaite is known to her followers as dada mzungu – Swahili for white sister.

It is claimed she has become the ‘trainer’ of an all-female suicide bomber squad targeting Westerners in East Africa.

Her appointment was announced on a website sympathetic to Al Shabaab, which revealed that Lewthwaite ‘gave her life to Allah and now she serves Allah as his female soldier in [Somalia]’, where she ‘commands her all-female mujahid terror squad and conducts operations against the kuffar [non-Muslims]’.

Earlier this year Lewthwaite broke cover with a Twitter rant at a fellow fanatic. She called fugitive Omar Hammadi, who has since been killed, ‘an irritating prat’.

It stemmed from a feud involving US-born Hammadi and former allies in the Al Shabaab network.

Hammadi dismissed Lewthwaite as merely ‘a girl in Kenya’.

Lewthwaite hit back: ‘Yes, am a girl in Kenya like dat makes a difference u misogynist!’ And in a reference to Mujahideen holy war fanatics, she added: ‘Fyi sam lewthwaite thinks u r a irritating obnoxious contemptible little Muj PRAT.’

In the wake of 7/7, Lewthwaite portrayed herself as another victim of the tragedy, describing the attack as ‘abhorrent’.

Several attackers from the Somali militant group al-Shabab stormed a Nairobi mall, which Lewthwaite has been linked to

She claimed to have had no knowledge of the plans and dreaded the day she would have to tell her children ‘what their father did’.

But earlier this month, the Daily Mail revealed a manifesto for terrorism that Lewthwaite wrote, describing her need to murder disbelievers and inciting others – including her children – to do the same.

The nine-page document revealed how she was grooming her four children to follow in the footsteps of Lindsay.

She wrote how she was ‘blessed’ to have had a holy warrior husband and of how she had sacrificed her comfortable Western life to fight non-Muslims.

She said: ‘Allah blessed me with the best husband for me. In fact, exactly what I asked for . . . before marriage.’

Lewthwaite is thought to be in hiding in Tanzania or Somalia.
