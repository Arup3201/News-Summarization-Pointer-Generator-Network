A remarkable album of photographs taken by the future King Edward VIII during a ‘sight seeing’ tour of the Western Front 99 years ago has come to light.

Edward, Prince of Wales, took his own camera with him on his morale-boosting visit to the front-line in France in 1915.

The young Royal took scores of snaps which included a group of captured Germans, shell holes, bomb damaged buildings and British troops practising throwing hand grenades at a dummy soldier.

He also snapped numerous Army officers he met on the visit and posed for several photos of himself as well.

The prince wrote captions on the back of some of the pictures, such as “Ruined House in Vassincourt near Bar le Duc. Note the shell holes in the wall!! Jan. 1915”

Edward, who 21 years later sparked a constitutional crisis by abdicating the throne to marry double divorcee Wallis Simpson, was an Army officer himself and joined the Grenadier Guards in June 1914.

He was said to have been desperate to go to the front and fight but was banned from doing so by war chief Lord Kitchener in case the future king was killed or was captured by the Germans.

Instead, he had to make do with visiting the men on several occasions in 1915.

The prince, who was aged 21 at the time, took the photos between January and September 1915 at various places in France, which were around five miles from the frontline.

The personal album remained with him and then his widow Wallis until her death in April 1986 when the 50 year lease on their grand house in Paris – and its contents – was bought by Harrods owner Mohamed Fayed.

The millionaire sold the album in 1997 to a private collector who has now made it available for sale at auction for an estimated £6,000 to £8,000.

Matthew Hayley, of the auctioneers Bonhams, said: “Prince Edward went to the front line as often as possible on something of a sight-seeing tour to boost the morale of the men. He became popular with the soldiers.

“It is quite remarkable to think that 100 years ago the heir to the throne could be placed so close to a war zone where there could have been things like unexploded mines.

“There are over 650 prints in the collection that were taken by him or with his camera. They are his own work which in itself is very interesting.

“The provenance is excellent. After taking the pictures and having them processed he kept them. They remained with him and then at his home in Paris until 1997.”

Some of the Army officers Edward photographed was Major General Prince Alexander of Teck and Lord Claud Hamilton, who was mentioned in dispatches the year before for commanding a machine gun for five days and nights without relief.

There is also a photo of British Indian Army officer Sir Pertab Singh, who commanded his regiments in France at the age of 70. And a picture of Edward alongside the French nun Sister Julie, the holder of the Legion of Honour Cross, is also included.
