Two men are locked in a legal battle over a 65ft hedge which it's claimed ruined the view of their picturesque Scottish valley.

The neighbours in Elgin, Moray, have enlisted lawyers in the dispute after the hedge's owner refused to cut a row of trees to half their height - a job which it is claimed would cost £10,000.

It is the first 'hedge rage' case of its kind in the rural region, thanks to new powers which were originally brought in under England's Anti-Social Behaviour Act in 2010.

Hedge rage: Two men are locked in a legal battle over a 65ft-tall row of trees (pictured centre) which it's claimed ruined the view of a picturesque Scottish valley from a bungalow. 'All we see is the hedge', he said

Landowner Donald Farquhar Brown, 58, complained the spruce, larch, silver birch and beech trees on a private track had steadily blocked out the light from his bungalow.

'When we bought the property 20 years ago we had uninterrupted views down the valley - now all we see is the hedge,' he fumed to council officers.

He asked 53-year-old neighbour John Albiston to cut down the trees to just over 30ft tall, around half their current height.

But Mr Brown's neighbour refused, and the two men then became embroiled in a dispute about whether the row of trees legally counted as a hedge or not.

The row has ended up in the hands of Moray Council, whose officers were forced to look up the Oxford English Dictionary definition of a hedge.

Mr Brown said the trees did count as a hedge because there were hardly any gaps between them.

But the hedge's owner disagreed - with his solicitors writing: 'Our client’s position is that the trees do not in fact comprise a “hedge” because they were never intended to be a maintained garden boundary.

Dispute: Council officers said the hedge should be cut every year to stop it growing above 33ft (file photo)

'They simply form part of a plantation of trees in a generally wooded rural location.

'In our client’s opinion the trees complained of do not cause any significant loss of light in the applicant’s garden, and do not materially contribute to any effect on the growth of plants.'

Mr Brown told The Scotsman he had already spent more than £1,000 on lawyers.

'They grow by about a foot and a half a year,' he said. 'Nothing has been done with them over the years and we have lost our view and light coming into the house.

'Not only that, we have concerns that they are a danger in high winds. The trees are very thin and during gales they get blown down.' 

Council officers have now decided the trees are a hedge after all - and have recommended they are reduced in height to 33ft before birds have a chance to nest in them.

If councillors rubber-stamp the plans today, the hedge's owner could be legally bound to prune the trees every year so they never grow beyond 33ft again.
