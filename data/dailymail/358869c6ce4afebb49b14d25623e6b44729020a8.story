Retiring Liberal senator Sue Boyce has gone out with a bang - labelling Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a ‘sexist’ and accusing the Opposition of ‘dog whistling’ with its asylum seeker policies.

Speaking on her departure from federal parliament at the end of the month after seven years, Senator Boyce told the Sydney Morning Herald she thought Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech was ‘powerful’ and within context, ‘brilliant’.

Although, the former Liberal Women's Council president said Mr Abbott would have been better described by Ms Gillard as a ‘subtle sexist’ - one of many in federal politics.

But Senator Boyce, a former journalist and public relations practitioner, conceded that Mr Abbott had been more willing to listen to women's views than many of her male colleagues during her time in office.

Some of the opposition's older MPs still ‘yearned for the life when proper mothers stayed home and looked after the children and proper fathers who had their slippers handed to them’, the mother-of -three said.

Senator Boyce said she was also concerned by the government swinging too far to the right, particularly on issues such as asylum seekers, action against climate change and same-sex marriage.

‘I think the whole asylum seeker issue is sort of fraught with dog whistling,’ she said, adding that she did not appreciate the language used by Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, particularly the term ‘illegal maritime arrivals’.

Meanwhile, Ms Gillard discussed on the Diane Rehm radio show in America what her reasoning was in deciding to deliver the 'misogyny speech' to parliament in October 2012.

'I think for me, the sense that after everything that I as the first woman prime minister had seen happen around me about gender and to me in that position, I was not going to stand there and get lectured about sexism.'

Ms Gillard said she had the opportunity, as Australia’s first female prime minister, to discuss sexism with other female heads of state, including Hillary Clinton.

'I think for men, that conversation starts with: "What kind of leader will he be? Strong? Weak? Compassionate? Strident?" And for women it starts with: "Can she lead?" and it's a subtle but significant difference,' she said.

'Yes we have talked about those things, Hillary and I, and I've had the opportunity to talk to some other leading women around the world about them.'
