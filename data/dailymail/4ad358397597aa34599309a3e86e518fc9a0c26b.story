Suppressed: Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin told Parliament it is 'not in the public interest' to publish the official report that labelled HS2 in danger of failing

A key report into whether the HS2 rail line would give value for money is being kept secret by the Government.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told Parliament he is using emergency powers to veto publication of the report that says HS2 is in danger of failing. He said that protecting the impartiality of civil servants’ secret advice to ministers has to take priority over disclosure to the public.

But HS2 protesters branded the gagging order an ‘absolutely ­disgraceful’ delaying tactic.

Campaigners against the £50billion high-speed line between London, the Midlands and the North of England demanded publication of the Project Assessment Review and its cost-benefit analysis under Freedom of Information laws.

Joe Rukin, of the Stop HS2 ­campaign, said yesterday’s decision was ‘absolutely disgraceful’ and a Government cover-up.

He said: ‘This veto has only been used a handful of times, including the blocking of publication of Cabinet discussions on the Iraq War, the NHS risk register and ­letters from Prince Charles to Cabinet members. This is the first time the veto has been used in relation to a ruling made by the Information Commissioner on environmental grounds.

‘This just proves that there has been, and continues to be an agenda from Government to deceive MPs and the public with spin and dismiss any independent information showing just how bad the HS2 project is.

‘All they want is to make sure this report stays buried for a little longer so they can con MPs into voting for their white elephant vanity project.’

The Information Commissioner, rejecting ministers’ objections, ordered them to release the report. But now that has been overruled by the Government veto.

In a written statement to MPs, Mr McLoughlin said: ‘The assurance of confidentiality is important in the conduct of the review. In my view, there is nothing in the nature or ­content of this particular report which outweighs that strong public interest against disclosure.’

High speed: The report about the proposed train line the warned there was a 'red or red/amber' risk of the project failing

Mr McLoughlin said he had given the 
Information Commissioner a ‘certificate’ under section 53 of the Freedom
 of Information Act 2000.

This overrides the Commissioner’s decision to force the Government to reveal the Whitehall report.

He
 said: ‘My decision to exercise this power of veto in this case was not 
taken lightly,’ adding that he decided it was an ­‘exceptional case’.

Information
 Commissioner ­Christopher Graham said: ‘This is a disappointing 
decision and I’ll be studying the Secretary of State’s explanation to 
understand why this has been ruled an exceptional case.

‘There
 are important legal issues to be considered here, and I’ll be 
­highlighting our view of them in an open letter to the Justice 
Committee in due course.’

The report, which included a cost-benefit analysis of the scheme, was given to ministers in November 2011 but never made public.

It
 is understood to warn of a risky timetable for HS2, poor management, 
low delivery confidence and suggestions that the success of the scheme 
is in doubt.

It says that 
at the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd there are ‘concerns over 
skills, capability and resources’, with too few people ­working on the 
project and many of those lacking sufficient skills. Last November, the 
Government published its strategic case document, painting a rosy case 
for HS2 including an upbeat benefit-cost ratio.

Richard Houghton of HS2 Action Alliance said unveiling the report is in the ­public interest. ‘The proposed

£50billion
 project will blight 500,000 homes – only 2 per cent of whose owners 
will receive compensation – and which will generate massive 
environmental damage,’ he said.

‘So
 far as we can see, the last time secrecy laws of this nature were 
invoked was during the Iraq war. The implications are immense.’

Anti-HS2
 protester Dr Paul Thornton, who brought the Freedom of Information 
request, said: ‘This is a delaying tactic on the part of ­Government as 
they know the decision is likely to go to judicial review.

‘This
 should not be necessary as Parliament should be scrutinising this 
arbitrary decision and ensuring that it is overturned, as it creates an 
alarming precedent.’

But a 
Government spokesman said: ‘It’s important to strike a balance between 
the benefits of transparency and protecting the ability of officials to 
“speak truth to power”.

‘The
 Major Projects Authority will not be truly effective if officials fear 
that their frank advice to ministers could be disclosed. The Government 
has decided that it is not in the public interest to release this 
report.’
