Victim: Lacey Gruntorad, 22, was killed after a car backed into her classroom and ran her over

It has been revealed that a 22-year-old student who was killed when an elderly driver backed into their classroom had just switched to that fatal seat moments before the accident.

Lacey Gruntorad had moved to different seat closer to the instructor because she knew that the teacher would be talking about massage therapy during the next portion of the class.

A police report from the investigators in Gilbert, Arizona has shed new light on the wreckage of the crash at Spa Prima that left Ms Gruntorad dead and two others suffered severe but non-fatal injuries.

The 87-year-old driver has not been identified, but she was believed to have accidentally hit the gas pedal rather than the brake, causing the September 27 crash.

'She repeated several times that she was thinking of that poor young person being gone now because of her,' the police report stated according to the Arizona Republic.

The woman 'asked God for help' and said 'she did not know how she was going to live since some parents lost a child because of her.'

The instructor who was in the classroom, Melinda Keeling, is thought to be the first one to realize that Lacey's last- minute seat switch was a fatal one.

Accident: Police determined that there was not enough evidence for the 87-year-old driver to face any criminal charges over the September 27 incident

Young: Friends say that Lacey was excited about the massage therapy course she was taking and had only started it three weeks before the accident

Ms Keeling, who's arm was broken during 
the incident, was searching for her students in the aftermath and 
realized Lacey was the only one missing.

'It dawned on her where Lacey was sitting was directly in front of where the car came in (to the classroom). (Keeling) said she started to get sick at the time,' the police report stated.

The massage therapy program had only been started three weeks before the incident, and Lacey was the only student who did not live to complete the course.

'She's been excited for a while to get into school, to further her life and be ready for the future. She had so many plans,' family friend Brandon Sharp told My Fox Phoenix.

Remorse: The elderly driver, who has not been identified, was visibly upset at the scene and said that she did not know how she would be able to live knowing that she had killed the young woman

Investigators ruled that drugs and alcohol were not factors in the accident and as a result, police will not press charges since there was not enough evidence of negligent or intentional motives.

According to the Arizona Republic, the driver told police that she had driven to the shopping center in order to take a friend to a nearby bank. The friend had just recently suffered a stroke and was unable to drive themself.

The driver also had to pick up her own cholesterol medication before returning back to the retirement community where she lives.
