Barwala resembles a fortress as thousands of security personnel brace for a possible showdown with the disciples of self-styled godman Sant Rampal.

The stand-off comes as the deadline for Rampal to appear in a contempt case ended on Monday morning.

Nearly 60,000 disciples, including women and children, have formed a human wall outside the Satlok Ashram at Barwala town in Haryana’s Hisar district. The stand-off bears the echoes of a similar case involving another godman. 

Armed and angry: Police say the godman's supporters are carrying traditional as well as modern firearms

Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who faces rape and murder charges, never makes a personal appearance in court, giving his statements via video-conferencing instead. In this he enjoys the support of the Haryana Police, who insist that Gurmeet be allowed the privilege. 

Returning to Rampal, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had earlier pulled up the Haryana officials after they failed to produce the guru. The officials cited resistance by the godman’s followers for their inability to present him in court. 

A large number of cars and SUVs are parked outside the ashram situated on the Hisar-Chandigarh road. Spread over 12 acres, the ashram is now dotted with pandals set up to shelter the godman’s followers from across the country.

“They (the supporters) are armed with traditional as well as modern firearms inside the premises. Many of the firearms are illegal. The followers are chanting the godman’s name to make their presence felt…,” a DSP rank police officer said. 

Sant Rampal, now revered by thousands, was born Rampal Dass to a family of farmers in Sonepat district’s Thanana village

Besides several thousand personnel of the Haryana Police, 10 battalions of CRPF and 14 battalions of RAF have cordoned off the entire area. The security personnel have already barricaded the two sides of the road nearly one km away from the ashram. No private vehicles, including those of the media, are being permitted to go towards the ashram. 

The local administration has cut water and electricity connections to the Satlok Ashram. It has also ordered a three-day shut-down of schools near the ashram, while local hospitals have been put on high alert. 

Meanwhile, pamphlets have surfaced alleging that two judges of the Hisar civil court are responsible for the tense situation prevailing from November 10.

One way of defusing the situation could be for the court to permit Rampal to appear before it via video conference, Satlok Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapoor says. 

“Sant Rampal is undergoing treatment for severe pain in the heart. He is not able to travel and, hence, it is not possible for him to appear in court,” he said. 

The spokesperson adds that Rampal has no issue with the court. 

“He is a man of principles. He only has concern with the two judges who took cognisance of contempt of court against him on July 22…,” Kapoor claims. 

The law facilitates everyone to put his point of view before court, Kapoor adds. 

“We have seen enough cases where courts have considered the request of concern persons, including accused, to appear before them via video conference. There is no conflict with the local police,” the spokesperson contends. 

Devendar Punia, a follower from Shahjahanpur, said the situation inside the ashram is deteriorating with every passing hour. 

“Inside the ashram, the followers are living on food stocks. The quality of water available in the ashram is big concern,” he added. 

Rampal's army defy state government

A resolution to the week-long stand-off between the Haryana authorities and supporters of godman Sant Rampal seems unlikely to come soon, as his arrest continues to remain an unacceptable option for his legions of followers. 

Despite Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s personal appeal to Rampal to appear in court, his followers have made it clear that they will - at best - allow him to attend hearings via video-conferencing.

Sources close to the state government said that two local BJP leaders, including Kalayat MLA Jaiprakash, as well as police officers had approached the Satlok Ashram with the request that they be allowed to take him into custody, but to no avail. 

“He is not feeling well and cannot travel. His appearance can be marked by video conferencing .We will follow the court’s directions,” Satlok Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapoor said. 

The authorities have so far adopted a gentle approach because they fear any move to forcibly arrest Rampal may result in violence, a prospect made all the more scary by the fact that the human chain around his ashram comprises multitudes of women and children. 

They are reportedly mulling the possibility of conducting the operation in the small hours of the day with the hope that they may not meet strong retaliation at that hour. 

Meanwhile, sources said the Intelligence Bureau has alerted the Haryana and Chandigarh Police about the possibility of “anti-social” elements manipulating the situation to sow disturbance. 

The alert reportedly suggests a suspicion that Maoists may mingle with Rampal’s supporters to spark violence.

From 'careless' engineer to spiritual guru 

By Manjeet Sehgal in Chandigarh 

This is the story of how a government engineer became a spiritual guru with thousands in thrall to him. Speaking of modest beginnings, Sant Rampal’s is about as humble as it comes. 

The ‘godman’ was born Rampal Dass to a family of farmers in Sonepat district’s Thanana village on September 8, 1951. After school, he got a diploma in engineering and joined Haryana government’s irrigation and public health department as a junior engineer. 

At the age of 48, in May 2000, he was reportedly removed from the department for carelessness. By then, however, his life had already begun to change direction.

A seer, Swami Ramdevanand, had taken him under his wing 18 years before. In 1999, Rampal established the Satlok Ashram in Rohtak district’s Karontha village. Before long, the ashram gained popularity and Rampal Dass began to court the title of ‘Sant’. 

He subsequently set up several ashrams across the state, including the one at Barwala, presenting himself as an incarnation of the 15th century mystic poet Kabir. His band of followers hit new heights. 

But the smooth run ended soon after. By 2000, he had run afoul of several Arya Samajis after he allegedly made derogatory remarks against the group’s founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati. 

In 2006, the differences between the two groups culminated in a clash that resulted in the death of one person. This is where Rampal’s tryst with the judiciary begins. 

Following the clash, Rampal was arrested on charges of murder and attempt to murder and his ashram at Karontha attached by the government. He was released on bail two years later, on April 30, 2008, after which he shifted his base to Hisar district’s Barwala town. 

In November 2010, the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the Rohtak administration to hand the ashram back to Rampal. It was after the matter moved to the Supreme Court that the ashram was handed over to Rampal again on April 7, 2013. 

A month later, on May 12, clashes again erupted between a group of Arya Samajis and Rampal’s followers. Two people were killed and around 100 injured as the police opened fire and lathi-charged the warring groups to control the melee. 

In July this year, Rampal and his followers went on the rampage in a Hisar court where he was to appear for a murder conspiracy trial dating back to 2006. 

Since his release in 2010, Rampal, who faces contempt of court, murder and attempt to murder cases in various courts, has skipped hearings 42 times, which is why he now faces contempt charges. 

An arrest warrant was issued when he failed to heed court summons last week, and this is where the current stand-off began.
