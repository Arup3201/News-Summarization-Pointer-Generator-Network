A Canadian woman has launched an online appeal for her grandfather's wedding band after he admitted trading it for a pint of beer 60 years ago - but his wife says she doesn't even want the 'cursed' ring back.

John Druken, then a young soldier in the Canadian Army, handed over the white gold band in exchange for a cold one during a three-day bender in Nova Scotia in the 1950s.

'I was in a tavern in Halifax and I ran a little short of money,' Mr Druken, now in his 80s, said this week. 'I was in the armed forces at the 
time and I was on a bender for about three days.'

Just a ring: The lost ring didn't come between the soldier and his wife, Coralyn, pictured together recently, and they were married for six decades without giving it another thought. Now Coralyn doesn't even want it back

Oh dear: John Druken, pictured as a young soldier in the Canadian Army, handed over the white gold band, shown right, in exchange for a cold one during a three-day bender in Nova Scotia in the 1950s

'I am not proud of it, but I sold my ring for a quart
of beer because, you know, at closing time that last beer looks better 
than all the rest,' he told The National Post, adding that he quit drinking not long after that.

However, the lapse in judgement didn't come between the soldier and his wife, Coralyn, and they were married for six decades without giving the ring another thought.

That's until Mr Druken recounted the tale to his newlywed granddaughter, Natalie Aalders. Hoping the internet could help reunite her grandfather with the ring, Aalders posted an ad on an online classified website looking for information.

Viral: The heartwarming story has gone viral, with thousands viewing the ad, pictured, online and dozens of camera crews descending on the couple's home in the tiny hamlet of Wolfsen

'I imagine the ring is long gone, but figured I would post this on the far off chance that someone would remember him and still have the ring, and possibly discuss how I can get it back for him while he is still around, maybe in time for Christmas,' she wrote.

Since then the heartwarming story has gone viral, with thousands viewing the ad online and dozens of camera crews decendeding on the couple's home in the tiny hamlet of Wolfsen.

However, Mrs Druken told ABC News she didn't even want the ring back, describing it as 'cursed.'

'I was practically attacked on my way to the grocery store,' Mrs Druken said. 'I know my granddaughter means well, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing.'

She added: 'We've been married 60 years and have never given a thought about it. That cursed old ring was worth nothing. I couldn't care less. It's just a ring.'
