Benidorm is the fastest growing destination for British holidaymakers for this coming bank holiday with the Spanish seaside resort town boasting a 164 per cent increase in departures compared to last year.

Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey continue to top the figures for bank holiday popularity, according to figures from travel comparison website TravelSupermarket.

The news isn't so sunny for Crete, Ibiza and the Black Sea, however, destinations which have all recorded significant drops in popularity over the past year. 

Best for British: Benidorm is 164 per cent more popular for the August bank holiday than it was last year

Old favourite: The perennial short break go-to destination is booming, says website TravelSupermarket

It's not just golden rays and sands being sought out for short breaks with Barcelona, Disneyland Paris, Paris and Amsterdam among the top 20 destinations being searched for with departure dates between August 20 and 23. 

Last year only Barcelona made the same list while Dubai and the Middle East have dropped out of the top 20 altogether.

France is a hot destination as well this weekend, with Nice (156 per cent), Paris (104 per cent) and Disneyland Paris (76 per cent) all attracting more interest than in 2013.

Benidorm is the undisputed king of the Costas, however, with Costa Dorada (down 55 per cent), the wider Costa Blanca area (down 44 per cent) and the Costa Brava (down 32 per cent) recording drops in interest.

TravelSupermarket spokesman Bob Atkinson said: 'With the Bank Holiday weekend here and many looking to get that last chance for a break before the long run into Christmas, it’s interesting to see so many people switching back into both the short break market, as well as value-led destinations in Europe and Egypt for their overseas holidays.'

 'With the economy appearing to be strengthening, those who have put off taking extra or second holidays are embracing the chance for a few days away in places that are familiar, yet not too much of a stretch on the budget.

Vive la France: Nice has enjoyed a 156 per cent rise in searches with Paris and Disneyland Paris also popular

'And our love of eternal classics such as Benidorm, the Canary Islands, Balearics and the Algarve seems to be re-enforced this bank holiday, with getting more holiday for less money, high on the agenda for Brits.

There are no long haul destinations in this year’s top 20, however Atkinson expects to see a rise in interest for locations such as Dubai and the Caribbean, along with Florida, New York and Las Vegas, when the sun well and truly disappears in the UK.
