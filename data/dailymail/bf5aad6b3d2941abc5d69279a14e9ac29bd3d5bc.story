A U.S. congressman from Florida was caught last week digging his finger in his ear and then eating whatever it was he found.

Representative Joe Garcia was at a May 7 House Judiciary Committee hearing on government surveillance, but it was his own reconnaissance mission that C-SPAN footage has now revealed.

It was a live shot, in fact, and the Key West congressman had the poor timing to undertake his treasure hunt while sitting directly behind his colleague as she took the floor.

Before the cameras have left him, the first term Democrat even looks at his fingers before putting them back into his mouth yet again.

Does the gentleman from Florida have something to share? Democratic congressman Joe Garcia was caught picking his ear by C-SPAN cameras last week, but it only got worse from there

First he looks at it: Garcia was sitting right behind a colleague as she addressed a House Judiciary  Committee hearing on government surveillance

Then he puts it in his mouth: While the hearing was about NSA activities, Garcia appeared to be on a one-man recon mission all his own

And a thumb: Garcia takes his hand from his mouth but soon puts the finger back in, along with a thumb

Third time's the charm: Just to make sure he didn't miss anything, Garcia's returns his hand to his mouth a third time, all while his fellow congressman still has the C-SPAN cameras directly on her
