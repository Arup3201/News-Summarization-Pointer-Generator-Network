A seemingly fit and healthy 28-year-old died from bowel cancer after doctors repeatedly told her she was suffering from a harmless digestive complaint.

Nursery worker Holly Slater visited her doctor several times over an 18 month period, yet doctors did did not recognise her symptoms - which included bloating and abdominal cramps - and mistook the beginnings of bowel cancer for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The cancer eventually spread to her lungs, bones and liver and she died in February this year.

To this day, there is no clear reason why she succumbed to the disease -  Holly was fit and healthy and there was no family history of the disease.

Her mother Lynne, 59, says outdated 
views to the disease cost her daughter's life - and is calling for 
doctors not to ignore symptoms in young people.

Because Holly had been diagnosed with IBS, she was prescribed medicine to ease her stomach cramps and laxatives to relieve her 
constipation.

While 
they were very effective in improving her quality of life, they were
 also masking the symptoms of a far more deadly problem.

Bowel cancer is traditionally associated with old age, with nearly 75 per cent of cases affecting those aged over 65.

But over the past decade, the number of cases in those aged under 30 has shot up by an alarming 120 per cent.

Experts do not fully understand why this is happening, but it is thought changing diets, with increased fatty and high-calorie meals, are fuelling the rise, although many sufferers, such as Holly, have lived a healthy lifestyle.

Holly started noticing a change in her digestion in August 2011, then aged 26. She started to suffer mild bouts of abdominal pain and constipation.

‘The doctor diagnosed her with IBS and at that point, apart from being a bit uncomfortable, it wasn’t really causing any day-to-day problems,’ says Lynne. ‘It wasn’t until the beginning of 2012 that the symptoms worsened.'

As time went on, Holly developed frequent trapped wind, constipation and occasionally loose motions. 'But there was no bleeding at all so cancer didn’t cross her or the doctor’s mind.’

The bouts of discomfort were also sporadic, which made the symptoms fit perfectly with her IBS diagnosis.

In
 the first few months of 2012, Holly visited her doctor repeatedly after
 she began to vomit.She was sent for a raft of blood and urine tests, 
yet results came back entirely normal.

Towards the end of March the pain and episodes of vomiting became more frequent, but Holly had booked a holiday in Florida with her boyfriend Jeff and she was keen to enjoy her herself.

‘She thought the stress of planning the holiday had made the IBS worse,’ remembers Lynne. ‘Her dog had also been diagnosed with cancer which caused more stress.’

Bowel cancer affects 40,000 Britons and kills 16,000 each year.

It usually starts in the large bowel but can rarely begin in the small bowel.

Symptoms usually include abdominal pain, blood in the stool, unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss.

It is the third most common cancer in the UK, but is the second most common in women.

Around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly.

Age, a low-fibre diet, being overweight, high alcohol intake, smoking and a family history of the disease puts you at an increased risk.

The disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent.

On her return, Holly’s condition continued to deteriorate and in the week before she was hospitalised at St Mary's Hospital, on the Isle of Wight, she visited her GP four times.

Doctors prescribed her more laxatives and suppositories but by then, she was vomiting almost continually in spite of taking anti-nausea tablets.

A further set of blood tests continued to tell her consultants that she was otherwise well, with no cancer antibodies.

Eventually she was referred for an ultrasound, but by the time the appointment arrived in April 2012, she had already been admitted to hospital.

At St Mary's Hospital, on the Isle of Wight, she was promptly X-rayed and given pain relief.

The X-ray showed that there was an abnormality, but doctors could not ascertain what was wrong.

‘The doctors thought she may have another inflammatory bowel condition called Crohn’s Disease and she was given antibiotics,’ says Lynne.

‘Even up until this point she suffered with none of the classic symptoms of bowel cancer such as bloody stools and diarrhoea.’

Doctors then performed a colonoscopy which showed a tumour in her colon.

She was immediately operated on and surgeons removed half her colon, surrounding lymph nodes and fitted a colostomy bag.

Holly underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy but her oncologist wasn't confident that the treatment would be successful.

‘Throughout this period Holly always tried hard to look her best and she found ways to dress that hid the bag,’ says Lynne. ‘She was always very positive.’

In September a CT scan showed that there was no remaining cancer.

‘She was looking forward to getting back to work and getting back to normality,’ adds Lynne.

But tragically, after another scan in January this year, lesions were found in her lungs.

She was sent for another scan which revealed that the cancer had spread to her lungs, liver, to her reproductive organs and her bones.

On February 14 Holly was admitted to hospital and given antibiotics and oxygen in a bid to relieve a chest infection she had developed. She was also given a session of palliative chemotherapy.

The antibiotics did not work and she was moved to a hospice five days later.

‘She died on the following morning very peacefully in her sleep,’ says Lynne. ‘I was able to stay with her all night and for that I will be eternally gratefully to the hospice.

'Holly did not want to be on her own. In the end her chest infection developed into pneumonia and she was so weak that she couldn’t fight it.’

Lynne is stoical about Holly’s illness, saying that she could not have received 'better treatment: ‘They tried their best to cure her. We had good support from the specialist nurses and both of her consultants.’

But she is keen to raise awareness about bowel cancer in the younger generation because, she says, attitudes need to change: ‘The number of cases in young people are rising and it is very easy to misdiagnose the disease.

Bowel Cancer UK is campaigning for more widespread screening and faster diagnoses for younger sufferers.

Even after her diagnosis and surgery, Holly, pictured here in May 2012, was keen to get on with life as normal

In the first research into the experiences of younger bowel cancer patients, their  ‘Never too Young’ report alarmingly reveals that just under half of women and ten per cent of men saw their GP more than five times before being referred to a specialist, or being diagnosed as an emergency.

In some cases, twice as many women as men had to wait over a year before being diagnosed.

Some younger people are at higher risk of bowel cancer because of a strong family history, a genetic condition such as Lynch syndrome or because they have an inflammatory bowel condition such as Crohn's disease.

However, many of these people are not receiving the screening they need to detect changes that could lead to bowel cancer, say the charity.

'If you have suffered with digestive problems for six weeks or more I urge you to visit your doctor. Don’t think it won’t be you because figures have shown that regardless of age, you are at risk,' says Lynne.

Lynne and the rest of her family – her daughter Carly, 31, and husband Ken,63 – were given colonoscopies after Holly’s death and it was found that there was no genetic cause behind her cancer. There is no history of the disease in her family.

'I'd like to think Holly could still be helping others,' adds Lynne, finally. 'It's what she spent most of her life doing.'
