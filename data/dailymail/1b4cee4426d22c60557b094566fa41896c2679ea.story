Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone unintentionally told the wife of World Cup journalist Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez that her husband had been killed in a car crash in Sao Paulo on Twitter.

Simeone tweeted that Lopez was 'not only a great journalist' but 'also a friend' after hearing of the news that led Lionel Messi to dedicate Argentina's World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old.

The Atletico boss included Lopez's wife, Veronica Brunati, in the tweet who, astonishingly, seemed to be unaware of the news, as she replied: 'No. Diego, don't tell me that. Please, someone call me.'

Simeone, who won the La Liga title with Atletico last season, tweeted: 'He was not only a great journalist, he was also a friend. Much pain. My condolences to @verobrunati and family. RIP Jorge 'Topo' Lopez.'

Brunati, replying directly, first simply wrote 'no', before going on to say: 'Diego, don't tell me that. Please, someone call me. I'm in a hotel in San Pablo in the Quality.'

The day after Lopez's death, Brunati changed her profile picture on Twitter to her and her husband.

Among those leading the tributes to Lopez was Messi who, after Wednesday night's win that saw Argentina set up a World Cup final showdown with Germany, dedicated it to the reporter.

'Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge 'Topo' Lopez,' wrote Messi, who was selected for random drug testing after they won 4-2 on penalties.

'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.'

Lopez, 38, was killed on Wednesday morning when a taxi he was traveling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car being chased by police.

Sport, an organisation Lopez joined in 2000, called it 'one of the saddest days in our 35-year history' after hearing of the news.

FIFA also paid tribute to the journalist, with head of media Delia Fischer saying they 'would like to send our sincerest condolences to the family, colleagues and friends of Argentine journalist, Jorge Lopez'.

Messi and Argentina face Germany in the World Cup final at the Maracana on Sunday.
