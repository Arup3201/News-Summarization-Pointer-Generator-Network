A Virginia chiropractor has been indicted on suspicion of intentionally shooting dead a family's beloved German Shepherd with a bow and arrow.

Court documents read in Fauquier County on Monday claim 47-year-old Howard Van Nostrand killed five-year-old Morgan on October 3 during deer hunting season because he was scared of being cornered by dogs.

However, the same court documents also state that Van Nostrand was 15-feet above the ground in a tree stand when he pulled the trigger.

Killed: Morgan was shot dead by two arrows fired by Virginia chiropractor Howard Van Nostrand on October 3

Devastated: Craig and Karen LeValley have said they are distraught at losing their beloved family pet

According to owner's, Craig and Karen LeValley, they first realized something was wrong when their other German Shepherd, Zeus, returned from a run around outside their property without Morgan.

They received a phone call from Fauguier County Sheriff's around one hour later following a failed attempt to find their dog and discovered Morgan dead from two arrows according to Fox News.

Nostrand had told police his childhood fears of being cornered by dogs had caused him to shoot Morgan, however, the LeValley's refute this.

They say texts sent between Van Nostrand and another hunter who was there in the tree stands prove his intent.

Memories: The LeValley's have set up a Facebook page called Paws for Morgan on which they have posted pictures of their dog as a puppy (right) 

The text were read out in court and allegedly reveal one hunter ask Van Nostrand what to do about the two dogs who were out on a run around the LeValley's property.

He allegedly replied he would take care of it and shot Morgan twice.

Van Nostrand has never denied shooting Morgan, but claims it was out of fear because he had been 'cornered by dogs when he was younger and didn’t want to take that chance again.'

The chiropractors legal counsel asked for a plea bargain but the request was denied according to Fox News.

Van Nostrand will appear in front of a grand jury on March 23 and is charged with cruelty to animals and destruction of personal property greater than $1,000. The case now moves to a jury trial.
