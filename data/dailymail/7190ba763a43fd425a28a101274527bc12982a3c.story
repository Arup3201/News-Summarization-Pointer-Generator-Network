Members of Iraq's Yazidi minority have been accused of carrying out revenge attacks on Sunni Muslim villagers they believe helped Islamic State commit atrocities on their community last year.

Arabs living in  Sinjar in Iraq's Nineveh province say groups of heavily armed Yazidis have made four raids on the villages over the past two weeks, leaving 21 people dead and a further 17 missing.

Yazidis, whose ancient religion has elements of Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam, suffered grievously after ISIS' rapid offensive last year. Hundreds were killed and thousands captured, enslaved and raped by the Sunni Muslim militants, who consider Yazidis devil worshippers.

Yazidis returning to their homes in Sinjar are uncovering one mass grave after another in the area - evidence of ISIS rule there from last August until its fighters were driven out late last year.

Now some Yazidis are striking back. 

More than a dozen Sunni Arab residents have told journalists that armed groups of Yazidis raided four of their villages in Sinjar two weeks ago, killing at least 21 people. A further 17 went missing.

'It was an act of revenge by the Yazidis,' said 41-year-old Dhafer Ali Hussein from Sibaya, one of the affected villages. 

'The aim is to expel Arabs from the area so that only Yazidis remain: they want to change the map.'

The identity of the Yazidi assailants is unclear because there are several competing forces fighting ISIS in Sinjar, with them all blaming each other for the raids..

But what is certain is that the reprisals expose how ISIS; incursion created divisions between communities that had coexisted for decades, turning one village against another and making enemies of former friends. 

They also show the risk of similar violence when other groups displaced by ISIS, such as Shi'ite Turkmen and Shabak, Christians and Kakais, are able to return home.

Amid ISIS' brutal rape and slaughter of the Yazidis, those who could fled in the summer heat in an exodus that prompted  U.S.-led airstrikes against the jihadists in both Iraq and Syria.

Over the past week, the remains of more than 40 Yazidis who had been unable to leave before the arrival of ISIS were discovered in two bloodstained pits in northwest Iraq.

Residents of Sibaya, now staying in another village about 28 miles away, say they helped Yazidis escape in August and stashed away their belongings for safekeeping, even though the jihadis punished those who were found doing so.

But Yazidis from the nearby Gohbal settlement say Arabs in the surrounding villages sided with ISIS looting their possessions and actively participating in what they call attempted genocide.

Sunni residents admitted several men from Sibaya had joined the militants but said they were killed or fled to Syria when Kurdish peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area in December.

After regaining control, the peshmerga confiscated weapons from Arab villagers, who began to receive threats from Yazidis, culminating in the attack on Sibaya and Chiri on January 25.

The following day, Yazidi gunmen plundered and torched the nearby Arab villages of Khazuga and Sayer, whose residents had already fled. Peshmerga intervened to prevent further attacks.

Most of Sibaya's 1,000 residents were sleeping when gunshots signalled the arrival of a military convoy flying the Kurdish flag. At first, they thought peshmerga or Kurdish secret police known as Asayish, both of which recruit local Yazidis, were conducting a routine inspection.

Two Yazidis, one in military uniform, came to 31-year old Nawaf Ahmed's house and ordered him to hand over his car keys and identification.

'Who does that belong to?' asked the one in uniform, pointing at an electricity generator, which Ahmed explained had been entrusted to him by a Yazidi friend. 'You are all Islamic State,' said the other, loading the generator into Ahmed's car and driving off with it.

Dozens of civilian cars began to arrive from the direction of Gohbal and men, whom the Arab villagers identified as local Yazidis helped themselves to household appliances, vehicles and livestock.

Women said the assailants, dressed in military and civilian clothing, pulled rings off their fingers and stole valuables from their pockets. Many people fled, some hiding in a nearby valley. 

Those who stayed said they saw the men spread out through Sibaya and pour petrol from jerry cans before setting fire to the village, incinerating several elderly people in their homes.

Kheder Ahmed, a 35-year-old shepherd with mental disabilities, was tending his flock on the outskirts of Sibaya when a car sped up to him. His elder brother, Idrees, watched from a distance as a man got out of the vehicle and shot Kheder before making off with his sheep.

Idrees later took Kheder to hospital in the Kurdish city of Duhok, where he lay last week with a bullet wound to his right side.

On the same ward were six other villagers wounded in the attack, including 11-year-old Raddad, who had been shot twice. 'It was like Judgement Day had arrived,' Raddad's father said.

As Sibaya burned, the gunmen moved on to Chiri, 2 km to the south, where 60-year-old Abdullah Muhammed watched smoke rising from the neighbouring village. One of the militants thrust a machine gun barrel in Muhammed's chest and ordered him out.

'Where should I go?' Muhammad recalled asking. 'Go to hell!' was the reply. 'We are the Yazidi state!' Muhammad said he had been spared because one of the assailants knew him personally and allowed him to escape.

Jomaa Marii was less fortunate: he was shot dead in front of his wife. 'I saw it with my own eyes,' she said.

Once night fell and the gunmen withdrew, residents of both villages returned to retrieve the dead, protected by peshmerga.

Of the 10 corpses recovered from Sibaya, three were old women, residents told Reuters. Four bodies had been burned, one belonging to a community elder bound to a chair. Eleven corpses were found in Chiri.

The villagers accused prominent Yazidi fighter Qassem Shesho of involvement in the attacks. 

Shesho, who is close to the dominant Kurdistan Democratic Party, confirmed he had been in Sibaya and Chiri that day, but denied his men were responsible.

'Our traditions do not allow for that kind of behaviour,' he said, blaming 'extremists' serving a foreign agenda - a reference to the rival Kurdistan Workers' Party and its Syrian affiliate, which are fighting in Sinjar and have formed a Yazidi militia there.

The PKK says it had nothing to do with it.

Yazidi civilians took up arms alongside them during a months-long siege of Mount Sinjar by ISIS last year. Kurdish peshmerga and Asayish officers are also present in the area.

Arabs and Yazidis agree Sinjar will never be the same as it was before Islamic State came, when they were friends and farmed together. Many Yazidis no longer trust the peshmerga to defend them, while the newly displaced Arabs, all from the Juhaish tribe, said they would return to their villages only if Kurdish forces physically separated them.

Since the attack on Chiri and Sibaya, two Yazidis have been killed in Sinjar, in what some believe was an Arab reprisal. Others said it was an internal Yazidi feud. 

'For every action there is a reaction,' said an Arab man from Sinjar. 'This is not over'.
