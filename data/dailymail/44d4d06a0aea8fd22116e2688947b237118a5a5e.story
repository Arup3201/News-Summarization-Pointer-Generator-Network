Roy Keane has revealed he launched an expletive-laden rant at Sir Alex Ferguson which ultimately led to his departure from Old Trafford.

Keane spectacularly fell out with Fergie following the then captain's harsh words during an interview with MUTV - which earned the Irishman a £5,000 fine from the club.

But worse was to come after a training-ground bust-up involving Keane, assistant boss Carlos Queiroz, goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and Ferguson.

Keane reveals in his book, The Second Half, extracts of which have been published in the Express, that Queiroz accused him of showing a lack of loyalty to his team-mates after his MUTV interview in which he tore into a number of the then United stars.

Ferguson stepped in to quell the row, saying: 'That’s enough. I’ve had enough of all this stuff.'

Keane responded by saying: 'You as well gaffer. We need f****** more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We're slipping behind other teams.'

When Van der Sar chipped in and suggested Keane could have used a 'different tone' the reply was robust. 

'Edwin, why don’t you shut the f*** up? You’ve been at this club for two minutes and you’ve done more interviews than I’ve done in my 12 years. It was MUTV – I had to do it.' 

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

Fergie spoke about the MUTV interview in his book - released last year - and Keane has answered back

Keane later met Ferguson to discuss why he had been left out of a reserves match, which had been pencilled in to help his recovery from a broken foot, but was shocked at how the meeting unfolded.

Fergie said: 'Roy, I think we’ve come to the end,' and Keane agreed, then chief executive David Gill presented a written statement on the Irishman's departure.

Keane said: 'They had it all ready. It was another little hand grenade they threw at me. Not an hour later, or two hours, or after the severance negotiations – it was already written.

‘I said to Ferguson, “Can I play for somebody else?” And he said, “Yeah you can, cos we’re tearing up your contract“.

'So I thought, “All right – I’ll get fixed up”. I knew there’d be clubs in for me when the news got out. 

'I said, “Yeah- I think we have come to the end”.

‘I just thought, “F******’ p****” – and I stood up and went “Yeah. I’m off”.   

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

Keane also revealed his exit cost him £1million – a bonus written into his contract if he played in 50 per cent of United’s matches that season.

But he does regret apologising to Fergie and Queiroz after the bust-up.

‘Now I kind of wish I hadn’t. Afterwards I was thinking, “I’m not sure why I f****** apologised”. 

'I just wanted to do the right thing. I was apologising for what had happened – that it had happened.

‘But I wasn’t apologising for my behaviour or stance. There is a difference – I had nothing to apologise for.’

In his own book, released last year, Ferguson said his former captain had 'overstepped the mark' and when questioned at the time, Keane said he would deal with the 'lies' on another occasion. 

I worked under two great managers and I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson for a simple reason. What was the most important thing in my football career? Brian Clough signing me. That kick started everything. 

Different managers, both brilliant. I think Clough’s warmth was genuine. I think with Sir Alex Ferguson it was pure business – everything is business. 

If he was being nice I would think: ‘This is business, this’. 

Brian Clough (left), pictured at the 1992 League Cup final, is the boss Keane rates his No 1

He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength. United was a much bigger club than Forest but his coldness made him successful. 

His message was the same. I was never once confused by one of his team talks or his tactics or his training. The message was always fresh. 

I must have heard him talk 500 times and I always thought: ‘Yeah, that was good’. 

I think that’s amazing. As a manager I would take Clough’s warmth and Ferguson’s ruthlessness and put them in the mix – but also add my own traits.
