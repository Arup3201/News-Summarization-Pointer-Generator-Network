American Dustin Johnson is out of the season’s final major next week and the Ryder Cup in September after admitting he needs professional help.

The big-hitting 30-year-old, known for his colourful lifestyle, revealed in a dramatic statement on Thursday night that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence. The PGA of America confirmed he won’t be part of the United States team at Gleneagles.

Johnson finished 12th in The Open two weeks ago and was fourth in the US Ryder Cup standings. Earlier this year, he got engaged to his glamorous fiancé Paulina Gretzky.

'We will certainly miss Dustin Johnson at Gleneagles, and we wish him the best,' the US captain, Tom Watson, said.' As one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3-0 at Medinah in 2012, he has clearly been an asset for the United States team. That said, the United States is a team with an abundance of talent.' 

Johnson’s statement read: 'I am taking a leave of absence from professional golf, effective immediately. I will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges I have faced. By committing the time and resources necessary to improve my mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation, I am confident that I will be better equipped to fulfil my potential and become a consistent champion. I respectfully ask for privacy as I embark upon this mission of self-improvement.’

Talk about a statement that left more questions than answers, a point picked up by European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley on Sky. ‘It’s much better for everyone if there is clarity,’ he said. ‘If something has gone wrong and he has been misbehaving, let’s get it dealt with and move forward.’

Johnson was known for a party lifestyle that led to him being labelled an unfulfilled talent. At 17 he was arrested for buying bullets that were later used in a gangland murder. In 2009 he was in trouble again after being charged with DUI (driving under the influence).

In May 2012, Johnson’s agent David Winkle insisted his client had not been serving a drugs suspension from the PGA Tour when he spent three months out of the game.

His coach Butch Harmon was forthcoming in a 2011 interview, revealing: 'Dustin and I had a come-to-Jesus conversation about getting his personal life in order. I told him he needs to figure out who he is and how committed he is to utilizing his talent. He needs to eliminate some of the, shall we say, extracurricular activities. He’s a fun-loving guy, I realize that. But there’s a time to play and a time to work and he needs to understand that better.’

Johnson seemed to have settled down since meeting Gretzky and was an impressive winner of the WGC-Champions tournament in Shanghai last November. Now it is to be hoped he can sort out all his personal demons.

The news regarding Johnson inevitably overshadowed proceedings on the opening day of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational here at Firestone, where Australian Marc Leishman led the way after a 64, with Justin Rose shooting 65.

Rory McIlroy represented a veritable beacon of tranquillity amidst a sea of tense faces fretting over Ryder Cup places.

Earning a Claret Jug will do that for a man, as the 25 year old threatened to carry on from where he left off at Hoylake.

As it turned out, an ugly double bogey from nowhere on his penultimate hole turned an opening 67 that would have fairly reflected his play into a 69 that still left him decently placed.

This is one of two big events left to decide the automatic Ryder Cup placings on both sides of the Atlantic and boy, can you tell.

Welshman Jamie Donaldson, one of those sweating on a spot, summed it up nicely when he said: ’You want to forget about it but all the time you’ve got this voice at the back of your mind nagging away and reminding you what’s at stake.’

It would be desperately harsh if the 38 year old Welshman missed out on a debut after being in the frame for virtually all the qualifying period but it could still happen. A two under par 68, therefore, was a gusty effort.

One shot nearer the lead was in-form Italian Frankie Molinari, currently 13th in the standings but who could leap into the automatic spots with a top three finish.

Tiger Woods was looking for a good score to shore up his own parlous Ryder Cup position and did that with a 68.
