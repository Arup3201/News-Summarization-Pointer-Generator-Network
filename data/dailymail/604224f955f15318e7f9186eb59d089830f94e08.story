Steve Harmison knew who to call when he first clapped eyes on a young, raw but gifted Ben Stokes at Durham eight years ago.

‘I’d never compare him to people who have gone before, including someone I was close to, but I remember speaking to that certain all-rounder when Ben was about 15 and the cheeky little sod had come into our dressing room,’ said one of England’s best modern fast bowlers. ‘I rang him and said, “I’ve just seen you”.’

The call was made, of course, to Andrew Flintoff, inseparable from Harmison during their England days, and the comparison has proved to be a valid one, with Stokes conjuring up echoes of the Lancastrian both on and off the pitch.

‘Fred asked me what I meant,’ said Harmison, ‘and I said, “Well, he goes out to bowl with no socks on and just picks up a bat and goes out to bat”. Everything is an event with Ben and he has gone on to be a phenomenal cricketer.’

Of all the promising young players who have emerged for England in the past year, none has the potential to excite — and perhaps frustrate — as much as Stokes, who joined the team in leaving for their one-day series in Sri Lanka on Sunday.

He has already shown, at 23, that he possesses rare ability with both bat and ball but also the propensity to flirt with the self-destruct button a la Flintoff, as most spectacularly shown when he thumped a locker in frustration in Barbados in March and badly broke his right wrist.

‘Ben can be as good as he wants to be,’ said Harmison, speaking to promote Royal London’s sponsorship of the Professional Cricketers’ Association Benevolent Fund. ‘But he needs to be used in the right manner and England mustn’t stop him being the explosive, charismatic character he wants to be. Personally, I would take a bit of pressure off his bowling and put more onus on his batting.

‘I think the frustrations of playing on a big stage and then going to a smaller one can get to him. He went last winter from Australia, with everything going well for him on fast wickets, to the Caribbean on slow ones being watched by one man and his dog. That’s when frustrations come out. He’s had to learn. Because of his own doing in punching that locker he’s let in two players in Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes who are now competition for places. But Ben is one of the best young players I’ve ever seen. It’s hard to put that on one man’s shoulders but if he is batting at six and bowling well, England have a very good team.’

Harmison believes England are approaching the most intensive 18 months of cricket in their history with a bowling attack that stands comparison with the fabled quintet of Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Flintoff and Ashley Giles from the 2005 Ashes.

‘Steven Finn is the key to how England do in Sri Lanka and the World Cup,’ added Harmison. ‘I believe that, if they are all fit and firing, (Jimmy) Anderson, (Stuart) Broad, Finn, Stokes and (Moeen) Ali is as good a line-up as we had in 2005, I really do. And Finn is the key to that.

‘If he can get back to his best it makes life easier for others. And they could be better than we were because, other than Jimmy, they have youth on their side too.’
