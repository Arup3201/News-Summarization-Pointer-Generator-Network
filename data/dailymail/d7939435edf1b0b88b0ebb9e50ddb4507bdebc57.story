Pippa Middleton may be one of a host of celebrities who is barely seen in public without them, but wedges are the shoes that men most hate on women, according to a new survey.

The study, by CouponCodes4u.com, found that the chunky-bottomed strap up ranked number one as the 'least attractive shoe trend' in men's eyes.

The discount provider asked 2,103 men how they feel about their partner's footwear collection, and 59 per cent said they thought she had bad taste in shoes.

Like it or pump it: Pippa Middleton and Halle Berry are both big fans of the wedge shoe... but men aren't so sure

Those taking part were asked questions related to their
opinions of their partner’s style, particularly when it came to footwear.

And in news that may come as a surprise to women across the country, 79 per cent said they actually pay attention to what the girlfriends or wives wear on their feet.

Twelve per cent said they only noticed 'sometimes'.

1. Wedge shoes (71%)

2. Uggs, pictured (67%)

3. Crocs (63%)

4. Platforms (58%)

5. Flip flops (55%)

6. Moccasins (49%)

7. Mary Janes (42%)

8. Ballet shoes (37%)

9. Kitten heels (34%)

10. Sneakers (25%)

When asked whether or not they would prefer to choose what type of shoes their partner wore outside of the house, 43 per cent said they would, while the majority, 52 per cent, said they wanted their partner to choose her own personal style.

Five per cent admitted it depended on the event and situation. Furthermore, only 41 per cent of men said that their partner had good taste when it came to personal shoe style, while 59 per cent disagreed.

When asked whether or not they considered women to be more attractive if they wore ‘attractive shoes’, the majority, 93 per cent, said ‘yes’ they were, while 64 per cent of respondents also claimed they personally purchased shoe styles they liked for their partner.

Mark Pearson, Chairman of CouponCodes4u.com, said: 'While we all know that women love to shop for the latest shoes trends, we wanted to know whether or not men love these shoes styles too and if they personally pick out shoes for their partner.

'Surprisingly, the men that took part in the poll were very vocal on the type of styles they preferred and what they deemed were a turn off when it came to shoes.

Tough decisions: Kelly Brook wasn't sure what to wear on set of her new film 'Taking Stock' today, left, while Kourtney Kardashian plumped for flip-flops, only men's fifth least favourite footwear

'A firm favorite with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Pippa, it seems that wedges were not a hit with men earning over half of the ‘unattractive shoe style’ vote.

'It seems that 21st century American men enjoy choosing their partner’s shoe wear and perhaps women should take this more into account the next time they go shopping.

'Who knows, maybe you will find that your man is actually very helpful when it comes to being fashionable.'
