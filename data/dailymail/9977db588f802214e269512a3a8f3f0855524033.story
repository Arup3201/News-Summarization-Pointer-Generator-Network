Eat your heart out Demi Moore, Madonna and J Lo, there's a new cougar in town - and she's out done all of you by dating a man 60 years her junior. And what's more, as these pictures show, he's not bad looking either. 

Ninety-one-year-old great-granny Marjorie McCool has been dating 31-year-old Kyle Jones for five years.

And in case you're wondering, the couple, who appeared on ITV's This Morning, have a rampant sex life, and a good one at that.Scroll down for video

'The sex is great!' Kyle told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby as the presenters visibly struggled to keep a straight face.

When the hosts tried to unpick Kyle's attraction for his great-granny girlfriend, Kyle from Florida, explained, 'Everyone has their thing that they like. It's hard to explain what visually attracts me to Marjorie, but I like the platinum hair, I like the skin, I like the features.'

'If wanted cheerleaders, I would have cheerleaders – you have to go for what you’re attracted to. But the attraction is definitely physical,' he added.

If you're wondering, as host Schofield did, whether Marjorie is up to the task of satisfying a young healthy red blooded male, fear not.

'Sweety, I can put my leg up on his shoulder. I’m not kidding. I have pictures to prove it,' she confirmed.

‘I get good loving and lots of attention,’ she added, but admitted at first she was surprised by his attention.

‘I’ve often dated younger men but not that much younger,' she said via satellite from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, where the 91-year-old lives.

Even though the pair get it on regularly, their relationship isn't exclusive. 

'I don’t really mind, I did at first but I got over it,' said Marjorie of their arrangement. 'I’m the oldest and feel privileged. It’s odd for a woman this age to have such a younger guy and it’s thrilling.'

Kyle said, ‘We have a very physical relationship. We talk on the phone every now and then, but it’s very sexual. We’ve been out a couple of times but generally it’s very physical.'

When Philip asked bluntly whether they just meet up to have sex, Kyle replied, ‘It sounds so dirty when you put it that way. But that’s accurate.'

One downside for Kyle is that the families are often suspicious. But the couple confirm Marjorie has no money and deny he has any financial motivation.

'Often their kids don’t like me and we can’t change that,' he said. 'I often get accused of being some kind of vulture. People think it's linked to inheritance, but not at all.'

The other issue Kyle faces, is that his lady lovers are often nearing the end of their lives.

'When I went back to Florida, three of the 
women I had been seeing there were no longer with us,' he said. 'I don’t believe in karma 
but I could walk outside and get hit by a car so generally it's not something I think about.

'I’ve never wanted kids. I’m not against the idea of being with one women but I haven’t found someone who’s stopped me in my tracks.

But that doesn't prevent Kyle from taking his granny girlfriends home to meet his mum. ‘Mums OK with it,' he said. 'At first she thought it was phase, but however many years later she now thinks, "That’s just Kyle".'

Kyle, who says says that he always been attracted to older women, has even taken girlfriend Marjorie McCool, 91 (L) home to meet his mother Ceceila Jones (R)

Kyle, who's previously appeared on TV across the pond said, 'Everyone's brain is wired differently, some guys prefer blondes, some brunettes, some like other guys - I like old ladies.'

The call centre worker was just 18 when he first acted on his attraction for older women and began a sexual relationship with a 50-year-old.

Now Kyle uses dating websites to find women as well as chatting them up in his daily life.

He said: 'Most of the time, the average age I go for is between 60 and 80.

'Whenever I'm trying to speak to an older woman, the first reaction I get is 'you're way too young'.

'I find persistence is good so I tell them it'll be fun.'

Despite a 60 year age gap, the couple say they have an excellent and active sex life

In 2009 he met great-grandmother Marge - short for Marjorie - in the bookstore where she was working and asked for her number.

Marge, who had been single for 37 years since splitting with the father of her six children, agreed to go on a date.

She said: 'In the beginning I got jealous of his other women but he keeps coming back to me and tells me I'm the best.

'The physical side of our relationship is wonderful. I amaze myself, he amazes me. There's nothing better.

Kyle mother Ceceila, (R) says she has realised that her sons preference for older women like Marjorie (L) is more than a phase

'I wear sexy outfits to bed. I try to keep my bra on though because I don't have much left.

'My family consists mostly of boys, and they don't really care - what I do is my business.

'Their ages are 71, 63, 61, 52 and 50.

'When people see us out together they probably think that he's my son, or maybe even a grandson. I have grandsons older.'

And while many of the women he dates can't believe such a young man would find them attractive, Kyle is adamant he does.

He said: 'Often, the things women are so self-conscious about is what I'm into. I like the neck lines and wrinkles.

'Women worry about their boobs sagging but I think the natural hang looks great. I'm really not a fan of plastic surgery.

'I don't like to say gray, I'm a fan of platinum hair. I prefer it natural.'

Kyle's mother, Ceceila Jones Clark, 50, said: 'I think a lot of children have crushes on their teachers, so it didn't strike me as strange.

'I really wasn't sure if that was something that he was going to stay with or if it was just a cougar phase some young men go through.

'However, later when I saw the kind of women he was spending time with I knew it wasn't a phase.'
