The roof of a church has been left with huge holes after heavy masonry fell through when it was hit by powerful lightning bolts.

The spire of St Andrew's Church in Ramsbottom, near Bury, Greater Manchester, was struck during thunderstorms today which have hit several buildings across the country.

Pieces of the spire, weighing more than a tonne, came crashing through the roof of the building, which was built in the 1830s, at around 7am today.

A large hole has appeared in the roof of St Andrew's Church, Ramsbottom, after a bolt of lightning hit one of four stone turrets on the tower

The building has now been declared structurally unsafe amid fears more masonry could fall from the spire

The damage was so extensive that the building has been declared structurally unsafe amid fears that more masonry could fall from the spire.

Lightning storms hit the North West throughout the morning, with major delays reported after lightning hit a train at Manchester's Piccadilly Station.

The lightning strike at St Andrew's Church was so loud that neighbours described the sound as 'like a bomb going off'.

Watch Manager Ady Tonge, from Ramsbottom fire station's blue watch, said: 'The damage is extensive and everyone at the church is devastated.

'There is structural damage to the tower and we have had to cordon off the whole church. The lightning hit one of the turrets at the top of the church's spire.

Firefighters said debris has fallen through the church roof, causing one major hole and five or six smaller ones

'Debris has then fallen through the church roof, causing one major hole and five or six smaller ones. There was also debris in the primary school playground next door.

'It is frightening to think what could have happened if it had happened a little later in the day and there were people around.'

The Grade II listed building, finished in 1832, cost £5,000 to build, which would be the equivalent of £320,000 today.

The Rev Andy Lindop, 56, who has been at the church for two and a half years said: 'I live about half a mile down the road and I heard the clap of thunder but I never imagined that the church would have been hit and all this damage would have been caused. It was like an explosion in the church.

'There are even dents in the school playground. The services will probably be moved into the school. It's just the church building that has been affected.

'Had it happened at a time when the building was in use it would have been an absolute catastrophe. It is just an absolute mess. It's terrible. Of course it's upsetting but it is only a building.

'There used to be four pinnacles and the lightning has struck the back pinnacles. My guess is that if it had hit one of the front ones it would have fallen forward. Instead large chunks have fallen through the roof. Inside it is a mess but it is all at the back of the church not the alter. It looks a complete mess.

'I have never known this to happen before. We have to just retain a sense of humour and regain the positives and thankfully no one was injured.'

Church warden Ian Ashworth, 58, said: 'I got a phone call about 7.20am saying that something had happened to the church. I only live down the road and I could see that one of the pinnacles wasn't there.

'It was like there had been an explosion with great pieces of stone all over the place. Unfortunately it left five substantial holes in the roof. The stone is sandstone and it's fallen from about 80ft.

'Inside it looks like a bomb has gone off, it has even blown all the electrics and blasted off the lights. Services are going to have to be postponed for many months and months.

'Thankfully the school finished last week but they had held three performances in here and they had their end of term service on Friday. Each night of the performances there were 200 people in there. If this had happened any other night there could have been a lot of disruption.'
