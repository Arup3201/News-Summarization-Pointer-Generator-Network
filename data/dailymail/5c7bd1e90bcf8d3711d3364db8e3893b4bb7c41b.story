Borne along under a canopy of snow white feathers, this fluffy cygnet took to the water yesterday heralding the start of summer.

The little bird hitched a ride on its mother’s back as she glided across the water at Abbotsbury Swannery near Weymouth, Dorset, where the first hatching is said to signal the beginning of the season.

Half-a-dozen cygnets were yesterday getting used to their new surroundings in glorious bank holiday sunshine.

They are the first of around 500 due to hatch at the swannery between now and the end of June.

Abbotsbury has the only managed nesting colony of mute swans in the world. Up to 600 return each year to raise their young.

The
Benedictine monks who owned the swannery until the 1540s believed the 
arrival of the first cygnet signalled the first day of summer.

The
first hatching this year happened at 7.45am on May 16, three weeks 
later than last year when the first cygnet emerged in April – the 
earliest since records began in 1393.

Nestled: Hundreds of birds come to the Swannery to raise their young. Six baby birds are adjusting to their new surroundings, with almost 500 due to be born in the next month

The cygnets have been placed in 
rearing pens so they can learn to swim in a sheltered spot.

About 100 
breeding pairs of swans have produced around 500 eggs on 100 nests; one 
pair has produced ten eggs alone.

Swanherds
feed the adult swans twice a day on wheat grains while the cygnets are 
fed three times daily on chick crumb, a crushed pellet full of protein.

Birds of a feather: The five youngsters stick together. They will soon be joined by hundreds of newly-born cygnets

As the birds basked in the sunshine, the bank holiday weather proved to be mixed across the country.

Thousands flocked to beaches and 
parks as temperatures in Norfolk, Suffolk, London and Essex edged up to 
highs of 64.2F (17.9C), but there was up to an inch of rain across the 
South West.

Much of the country will face wet weather and cooler temperatures for the return to work today.

Met
Office forecaster Helen Roberts said that tomorrow it would be cloudy 
across many areas with heavy downpours in some places, adding: ‘The rest
of the week is looking fairly unsettled.’
