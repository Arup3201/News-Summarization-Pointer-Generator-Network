A misprinted Florida sheriff's office rug has sold for almost £10,000 - with all proceeds being donated to a dog charity.

The forest green rug displaying a large sheriff's star was placed a few months ago in the lobby of the new public safety complex, which houses the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.

The rug should have read 'In God We Trust' but a small typo quickly changed an age-old adage to a tribute to canines. 

A misprinted Florida sheriff's office rug, which reads 'In Dog We Trust' has sold for £9,650 with all proceeds being donated to a dog charity

There were two of the same type of rugs in the office, but only one contained the typo. All of the other words on the rug were spelled correctly

For months, nobody noticed the error. 

But a deputy recently spotted a misspelling and the $500 rug was removed the next day.

Now, after a seven-day online auction which started bidding at $100, it has sold for £9,650 - with all proceeds being donated to Canine Estates, a charity for injured and abandoned dogs.

Accompanying pictures of the lot, a description read: 'The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office will not “sweep anything under the rug.” 

'Due to extensive interest regarding our plans for the “doggone” rug, you can bid on it here, and we will donate 100% of your bid to Canine Estates Inc., a local animal rescue.' 

There were two of the same type of rugs in the office, but only one contained the typo. All of the other words on the rug were spelled correctly. 

A spokesperson for the sheriff's office said the manufacturer, American Floor Mats, is to blame for the error because the proofs the office signed and submitted to the manufacturer contained the correct spelling, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

The rug was in the office's entrance when the deputy noticed the error. It was quickly rolled up and put away
