A commuter bus driver can be seen bracing himself as his passengers scream in terror before the vehicle crashes into a school bus in a harrowing dashcam video released yesterday.

The split video, shot on January 10, shows both the commuter bus operator and the road ahead as he heads to New York City on Route 9 in Old Bridge, New Jersey, with about 30 passengers.

As the Academy bus - shuttling passengers from Lakewood to Manhattan - drives along in the bus lane on the right, a school bus that had been in the lane beside it suddenly makes a right turn.

Alarmed passengers are screaming as the buses collide.

With the school bus out of view, the the driver struggles to turn the steering wheel and keep control of the vehicle, but it hurtles off the road.

'Oh my God!' one passenger shrieks as the commuter bus hits a road sign.

Crash course: The driver, identified as Daniel Jean-Pierre, had to be extricated from the bus after it struck a tree on the side of the road

The bus then smashes into a tree in a devastating impact.

The Academy bus driver, Daniel Jean-Pierre, of Barnegat,
was hired by the firm in May and has a clean driving record, company 
spokesman Joe Orlando said.

He was seriously injured when his 
legs were pinned in the bus after it hit the tree, and he was airlifted 
to a New Brunswick hospital where he underwent surgery Thursday, Orlando
said.

A female passenger on the Academy bus 
also suffered serious injuries and was airlifted to a hospital.

Impact: The 55-seat Academy bus was carrying 30 to 35 people when it went off the road, hit a telephone pole and then smashed into a tree

The school bus was on its side when emergency vehicles arrived at the scene of the crash.

No children were on board at the time, but its driver and an aide, both women, suffered minor injuries when the bus flipped over and toppled onto a power supply station.

Police said the two climbed out of a roof hatch.

The crash remains under investigation by authorities.

Chet Singh, a resident of the 
apartment complex, said he heard a loud boom and shattering noise from 
his second-floor apartment and ran outside with other residents.

Mr Singh said at the time: ‘Everybody
started running out toward the street,’ he said. ‘I saw a huge bus with
a tree sticking out of the front.

‘People
were screaming. They couldn't get out of the bus. Then I saw the school
bus and ran over there but I saw there were no children in it.’

Passengers on the Academy bus opened emergency windows to escape, and rescue teams were able to pry open the front door.

The tree shattered the bus' windshield, and a large branch protruded from the vehicle's roof.

The school bus windshield also was 
smashed, as were several windows on its left side.

Power to the 
apartment complex was initially cut off as a precaution and later 
restored, police said.

A
sewage pumping system located near the power supply station was knocked
out, and crews were working to restore it Thursday afternoon.

By noon, workers had lifted the bus off the power station using a crane and loaded it onto a tow truck.

The
Academy bus had made most of its stops en route from Lakewood to Wall 
Street in Manhattan, with just a few stops left on the run, Orlando 
said.

Silver lining: The mini school bus was not carrying any children at the time of the collision, and the driver and a school aid who were on board suffered minor injuries
