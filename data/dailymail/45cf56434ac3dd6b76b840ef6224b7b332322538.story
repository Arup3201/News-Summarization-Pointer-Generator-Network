Police in Tuscany have seized over 160,000 litres of top dollar Brunello in a million pound wine scandal that has scandalised Chiantishire.

Hundreds of thousands of bottles of cheap table wine were falsely labelled as two of the country’s most respected reds Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino wines, which can sell for up to £100 a bottle, it is alleged.

The massive bust comes just months after opera star Andrea Bocelli became the victim of a scam in which cheap plonk was passed off as premium Brunello di Montalcino and Chianti from his estate in Tuscany.

Financial police in Siena said on Tuesday they seized the wine, ‘with an estimated value of nearly one million euros, as part of an anti-fraud operation.’

A wine expert allegedly replaced the Brunello with rough wine, costing as little as 80p a litre, before using his influence with local producers to obtain official state labels and other authentic documents, invoices and transport records.

The scam is thought to have cost wine producers in Tuscany, where Chianti and Brunello di Montalcino wines are produced, hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost sales.

The enologist now faces charges of commercial fraud, illegal access to computers, aggravated and continued embezzlement.

In May it was reported how Andrea Bocelli was scammed by conmen after they produced tens of thousands of fake bottles of his own branded wine - and sold it for up to ten times the price.

The rip-off versions of Bocelli a Lajatico were sold in Italy and abroad alongside fake bottles of other classic Italian wines, such as Chianti and Brunello.

Investigators trawled wine cellars, shops, supermarkets and bottling factories to uncover the scam.
