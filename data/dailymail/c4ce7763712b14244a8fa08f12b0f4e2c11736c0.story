A police force has raked in over £270,000 in the past year by selling confiscated goods on the online action website ebay.

Leicestershire police became the first force in the country to use ebay to sell the seized assets of criminals which included flashy sports cars and designer jewellery.

The items that were auctioned off included luxury cars, computers and clothing which the courts confirmed had  been paid for with criminal cash.

Online store: The unusual ebay shop opened in September 2009 and the total raised since then is more than £1.2 million.

Motor: This flashy silver Bentley continental GT auto 2006 sold for £32,875,00 on the online site

All the money the site generates will go back to fund crime-fighting work. Leicestershire police said it hopes it will prevent criminals from benefiting from their loot.

Many of the items were confiscated thanks to tip-offs from the public, who became suspicious of people who were living the high life despite having no obvious legitimate income.

Some of the items included high-powered sports cars for tens of thousands of pounds, others included designer jewellery and DVDs. 

The unusual ebay shop opened  in September 2009 and the total raised since then is more than £1.2 million.

In the past year, it has sold an Aston Martin DB9 car for £63,000, an Audi A5 for £29,500 and a Range Rover for £15,500 and a Mercedes car for £7,751.

Meanwhile, police sold a Rolex watch online for more than £13,000 and a signed autograph by legendary crooner Frank Sinatra was snapped up for £260.

Paul Wenlock, head of Leicestershire Police's economic crime unit, said the site had been a 'huge success'.

Watch: This rose gold Versace ladies watch with mother of pearl dial and three part rotating face had a white satin over leather strap and sold for £320 in 2011

Diamonds: This Tiffany diamond set key pendant with a heart motif was 18 carat white gold, the pendant is suspended from a 46cm long fine chain necklace with a bolt ring clasp and sold for £621

He said: 'The site is also a daily reminder we will take civil as well as criminal action to ensure criminals do not benefit from their crimes.

'In some cases, we have been able to seize goods and sell them where we have not managed to secure a criminal conviction.

'All the money the site generates goes back to fund crime-fighting work.

'Often the inquiry starts from information from members of the public.

'If you know anyone who appears to be living a lifestyle beyond their visible means, we would like to know. We can take both civil and criminal action to be sure they do not benefit from these activities.'

Everything the force has sold had been seized and formally confiscated by the courts under the Proceeds of Crime Act after officers proved they were bought with criminal cash.

Handbag: This leopard print Prada handbag sold for £511 and was just one of many luxury items on ebay

The cash is used to fund further crime-fighting, while some is donated to good causes, including organisations which support victims of crime.

And thankfully the force's eBay seller rating – which reflects its customers' satisfaction levels – is 99.8 per cent

Police officers also use eBay to sell other items in its possession - they made £39,209 by selling surplus police equipment and £24,050 on unclaimed lost property.

It's not known whether other police force's intend to follow suit.
