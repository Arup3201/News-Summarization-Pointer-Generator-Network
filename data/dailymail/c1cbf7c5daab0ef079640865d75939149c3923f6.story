When choosing who would act as chief supporter on his wedding day, this groom-to-be wanted the best of the best.

Demanding Duncan Twigg had his younger brother and three closest friends compete for the honour of being his best man in a series of wacky challenges - ranging from a dance-off to a hot dog eating contest.

After two years and 12 contests, Mr Twigg, 31, from Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, eventually chose his brother Chris Twigg to stand beside him when he weds his fiancee Rosanna Lethbridge in Devon this weekend.

Coveted role: The groom-to-be's brother Chris Twigg and friends Luke Redel, James Bradwell, and Dan Shaw (l-r) competed for two years to be Duncan Twigg's (being lifted) best man

Chris, 29, today said there was 'no way' he was going to lose to one of his brother's close friends; Luke Redel, 30, James Bradwell, 31, and Dan Shaw.

The rivals had gone to extreme lengths to prove themselves worthy of being named best man, competing in a speech contest, a pub treasure hunt and a Come Dine With Me-style challenge in a bid to impress the groom-to-be.

Mr Twigg, who proposed to his girlfriend Rosanna at the Grand Canyon in May 2011, likened his friends' antics to having '12 stag dos'.

'There's been a lot of fun and games,' he said.

'It's been a great excuse for the guys to get together. We even had a bit of a following along the way as about ten to 15 people came along to each challenge to watch.

'Every single one was a great social event - it's been an absolute blast.'

Mr Twigg added that his wife-to-be had been 'very patient and supportive' throughout, despite having a wedding to organise.

Determined: The candidates performed a series of wacky challenges, taking part in everything from a traditional school sports day (pictured) to a hot dog eating contest

The challenges kicked off in August 2011 when the four men, all from Nottingham, competed in a pub treasure hunt.

This was followed by a test to see which of the boys could make the most money from a starting sum of £10 within eight hours.

After that came a traditional school sports day, which saw the four men pitted against one another in an egg and spoon race, a three-legged race and a sack race.

Challenges: In total the would-be best men performed 12 tasks,  including a Come Dine With Me-style contest (left) and a board game challenge (right)

Still not satisfied, Mr Twigg went on
to challenge his friends to compete in the Come Dine With Me contest, a 
pub quiz and a pub games tournament featuring darts, pool and dominoes.

At this stage training assistant Chris had gained a 10 point lead on his rivals.

The boys then took their respective 
campaigns for the role online in a YouTube challenge to see who could 
get the most hits. They were then tasked with inventing a board game, a 
round of pub Cluedo, a best man speech contest, before rounding it all 
off with a hot dog eating competition.

Mr Twigg said: 'Chris was out in front from about the halfway point.

'I'm really pleased he won.'

'Everyone I've spoken to about the challenges said I should've just chosen him anyway.

'But this makes it sweeter,' Mr Twigg said.

'He put in the most effort of the four to win - and he is my brother after all.'

The groom-to-be said his favourite event was the dance contest, which was judged by their local MP Anna Soubry.

His brother won five of the 12 challenges - but only managed second place in the speech writing contest.

'He'll be even better come the real thing, and I'll probably get a lot more stick,' Mr Twigg said.

His brother and best man-to-be said: 'There was no way I was going to lose because I should have been picked originally.

'But knowing Duncan as I do I had to humour the contest and try that little bit harder to make sure that I won. I was determined to win it because he is my brother and it was something I really wanted to do.

'We've grown up together and it's going to be such an honour to be by his side when he gets married,' Mr Twigg said.

Tying the knot: Duncan Twigg proposed to his fiancee Rosanna Lethbridge at the Grand Canyon in the U.S.

The boys took revenge on Mr Twigg at his stag party - which his brother was finally able to organise last month - setting him challenges of his own during a weekend trip to Liverpool.

'They bought me a four foot-long Subway sandwich and ordered me to eat it,' Mr Twigg said.

'I only got about a third of the way through before I was full.

'I definitely preferred being the one who set the challenges,' he added.

Come Dine With Me: Mr Twigg's brother and friends each whipped up a feast for this challenge

Dance-off: The candidates efforts on the dance floor were judged by their local MP Anna Soubry

Entrepreneur challenge: Chris Twigg, seen left trying to turn a profit from a starting sum of £10, was eventually named the winner

Head-scratcher: The candidates were tasked with designing a board game over two years' worth of challenges

Crucial choice: The would-be best men were all asked to write and deliver a best man's speech for Mr Twigg

The impressive efforts of the three 
disappointed candidates will not go unrewarded at the weekend, as they 
will all be ushers in the wedding party.

The
contest was inspired by the film 12 Rounds - starring John Cena and 
Ashley Scott - in which a detective is set a dozen challenges to free 
his kidnapped girlfriend.

Bride-to-be Rosanna, an accountant, said she always believed Chris was the right man for the job.

'I've had to be pretty patient and understanding about it all as we've had quite a lot to do with organising the wedding,' she said. 'But I understand why Duncan had to do it because it was a hard decision for him.

'Personally I thought Chris all along and he really did put in more effort than the others in the end.

'It has been such a good laugh though and I particularly enjoyed being spoiled by the boys in the Come Dine With Me challenge.

'It's going to be lovely to have Chris up there on Saturday and we really can't wait.'
