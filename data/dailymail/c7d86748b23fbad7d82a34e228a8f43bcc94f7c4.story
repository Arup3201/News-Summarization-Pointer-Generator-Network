Jeremy Clarkson's troubled personal life made him increasingly unpredictable in the weeks before his 'fracas' with a producer, it was claimed yesterday.

A senior BBC executive said the Top Gear presenter's 'erratic behaviour' had caused growing concern among his colleagues.

He claimed Clarkson was 'self-destructing' after separating from his wife Frances and suggested he should go to rehab.

The presenter's production team have been concerned about his behaviour for some time, a former colleague said.

Clarkson, 54, will this week be questioned by the BBC's official inquiry into the row over a steak dinner that resulted in his suspension.  

A relaxed Clarkson said nothing about his upcoming disciplinary hearing as he left his flat in west London today. 

The 54-year-old, driving a black Mercedes AMG, was asked by reporters if he was on his way to meet with BBC bosses.

Ken MacQuarrie, the senior BBC executive tasked with sorting out what is becoming an increasing embarrassment for the corporation, is believed to be in London and starting work today.

But sources close to the investigation say it is impossible to put a deadline on its work until it hears from the two men central to the inquiry - Clarkson and producer Oisin Tymon. 

As he prepares for a quizzing which could result in him being sacked, he is apparently being supported by a woman once rumoured to be his mistress.

Blonde events organiser Phillipa Sage was photographed driving away from his flat in Holland Park, west London, yesterday afternoon, and returned a few hours later.

Clarkson was accused of having an affair with her in 2011, and was pictured kissing her on holiday in Greece in 2013.

He was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Mr Tymon. One report claims he split his junior colleague's lip with a punch.

Mr Tymon, 36, has received online threats from Top Gear fans, who blame him for Clarkson's suspension and the show's temporary cancellation. Sources close to the producer's legal team said he feared the incident could end his BBC career.

'He loves working on Top Gear and has never had an issue before this incident, which came out of the blue,' an insider told the Sunday Mirror. Top Gear viewers could learn the outcome of the Corporation's investigation as early as this week. A BBC source said yesterday: 'People will not have long to wait.'

The internal review, headed by BBC Scotland boss MacQuarrie, will focus on the apparent bust-up at the Simonstone Hall hotel in North Yorkshire on March 4.

Clarkson is said to deny punching Mr Tymon but admits there was 'handbags and pushing' after he arrived late at night and was told no hot food was available.

A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC's position is the one we set out in a statement last week. We have an investigation led by Ken MacQuarrie to establish the facts and people should wait for the outcome of that.'

Clarkson is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected early this week.

BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, runs the annual global tours which pull in around £10million a year. Around 30,000 tickets ranging from between £38 to £104 have already been sold, and Clarkson fans have been desperate to know whether he will be appearing. 

The controversial presenter has appeared at every Top Gear Live event the BBC has run, while co presenters James May and Richard Hammond only appear at some shows.

BBC worldwide said all forthcoming shows are set to run as scheduled - but would not be drawn on whether Clarkson would definitely appear. 

All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant. 

A source close to Clarkson told the Mail on Sunday he had not drunk anything because he had to work on a script that evening.

But there are wider concerns among BBC management about his recent conduct. A senior TV source who has worked with Clarkson told the Daily Mail: 'The real story is his erratic behaviour – it features a lot with Clarkson.

'The production team has been aware of this but how much can they do about it?'

Separately a senior BBC executive compared Clarkson's supporters – including David Cameron – to those who covered up for late paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile

'The pressure this guy [Mr Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,' he told the Mail on Sunday.

Referring to Clarkson's split from his wife last year, the unnamed executive added: 'It is common knowledge he has personal issues: we have all read about them.

'If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change.' 

Responding to the executive's comments, spokesman for the Corporation said: 'The BBC's position is the one we set out in a statement last week.

'We have an investigation led by Ken MacQuarrie to establish the facts and people should wait for the outcome.'

Supporters of Clarkson pointed out that he has experienced a torrid 12 months. His marriage of 21 years ended, his mother died and he has suffered health problems.

Journalist and close friend AA Gill yesterday said the Top Gear host felt he was 'working for the enemy' at the BBC.

Mr Gill accused BBC director of television Danny Cohen of targeting Clarkson for not fitting into his 'inclusive, positive, left-of-centre perspective on the world'.
