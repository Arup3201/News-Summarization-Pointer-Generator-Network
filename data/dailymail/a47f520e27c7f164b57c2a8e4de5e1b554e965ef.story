This is the moment a gang of shameless fraudsters were pictured celebrating after pulling off a huge scam worth up to £2 million which saw them using fake credit cards to buy and sell goods including cars, fridges and even dog food.

The organised crime group posed for the picture  after they used a counterfeit card machine to create fake credit cards so they could embark on an online spending spree.

Yesterday at Manchester Crown Court the six men, all from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and were jailed for a total of more than 16 years.

Police found the photo on a mobile phone while investigating 2,000 frauds against businesses across Britain, which were duped into sending the gang a range of good including cabling, tiles, food, alcohol, fridges, cars, high-value metal and other wholesale goods over 18 months.

The gang used stolen credit card details from black market internet forums before adopting the identities of the account holders so they could pay for the goods over the phone.

The court heard the goods were delivered to a variety of locations across the gang's home turf of Rochdale.

Unsuspecting private couriers were met by the gang, the goods were unloaded and shortly afterwards collected by pre-arranged buyers.

Several weeks later, the companies discovered they had been defrauded and the account holders, whose details had been stolen, reported the unusual transactions to their banks.

As a result the funds were taken from the businesses' accounts leaving them at a loss.

Police began investigating in November 2011 after a tip off about the gang unloading a quantity of stolen steel. 

Detectives caught two of the gang in the act and as the investigation progressed officers also seized quantities of dog food, fridges and alcohol which had all been bought using compromised details.

Officers also recovered phone records and text messages between the gang which showed an exchange of card details, aliases and potential targets. 

At one house officers found an embossing handle used to print card numbers onto counterfeit cards and fake credit cards were found at three other properties.

Software to write card details onto the magnetic strips of credit cards was found on a laptop in one gang member's bedroom.

Initial inquiries by Greater Manchester Police's Fraud Investigation Team identified the gang fraudulently ordered more than £600,000 worth of goods from 57 companies across the UK between June 2011 and November 2012.

But officers believe this is just the tip of the iceberg as analysis of phone records suggests they contacted more than 2,000 potential victims and couriers and that the actual loss could be in excess of £2 million pounds.

Ringleaders Ammar Khalid, 27, was jailed for four years whilst Irfan Khan, 26, and Ahmed Pasha, 27, were each sentenced to three years four months imprisonment.

Shazad Arshad, 20, got 18 months whilst Hamza Mughal, 26, and Faraz Malik, 28, were each locked away for two years.

Two other men were convicted of handling stolen goods. Aqeel Malik, 28, from Rochdale, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 12 months, 200 hours unpaid work and a nine month supervision order.

Mohammed Sohail Khan, 26, of Oldham, was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment suspended for 12 months, 200 hours unpaid work and a 9 month supervision order.

Two more men will be sentenced at a later date.

Det Sgt Phil Larratt, of GMP's Fraud Investigation Team, said: 'This gang were involved in a concerted, full-time operation to defraud companies out of thousands of pounds worth of goods.

'It is clear from the sheer scale of the evidence we recovered that these men thought they had an unearthed a goldmine and had no intention of slowing down or stopping. 

The gang used stolen credit card details they obtained from the dark web.

They then used those details to create fake credit cards using a counterfit xcard machine and an embossing handle.

They then used the cards tp buy up to £2 million worth of goods which they later sold on for profit.

The gang bought everything from dog food and fridges to alcohol,

When the owners of the stolen credit card details reported the unusual transactions to their banks they were refunded the money - leaving the business owners at a loss.

'I have no doubt they'd still be trying to con businesses out of thousands of pounds today had we not caught them.

'This was this gang's full-time occupation. The group operated as a business with a clear hierarchy and structure. 

'Ammar Khalid, Irfan Khan and Ahmed Sohail Pasha directed operations from the comfort of their own homes, accessing the dark web and placing orders using the compromised card details.

'In times of austerity, these businesses lost tens of thousands of pounds thanks to the underhand tactics of this gang and potentially could have faced financial ruin.

'However, thanks to the work and dedication of the officers from the Fraud Investigation Unit we were able to unravel their web of deception and they have now been exposed so that no other businesses can be targeted by this gang. 

'We carried out a painstaking investigation involving meticulous examination of financial and phone records and I am delighted all that work has paid off. '

'Greater Manchester Police are determined to disrupt and prosecute the perpetrators of this type of serious and organised criminality. 

'Anyone found guilty of committing these types of fraud, as this gang have found out to their cost, can expect a stint in prison.'
