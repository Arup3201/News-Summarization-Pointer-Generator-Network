A killer murdered an antiques dealer and left his body undiscovered for five weeks as he repeatedly returned to loot valuables, a court heard.

Graham Richardson allegedly clubbed Peter Battle, 56, to death with a heavy ornament and hid the body at his cottage in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire.

He then went back on several occasions, helping himself to antiques and collectables which he sold, it was said.

Richardson, 27, allegedly ‘played the generous grandson’ as he gave some of the valuables as gifts to elderly friends and relatives.

Victim: Antiques dealer Peter Battle was was found murdered in his countryside home in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire

A court heard he covered up the killing with ‘cunning and guile’ by posting fake notes on Mr Battle’s window and covering his body and a window so it couldn’t be seen.

The murder is said to have taken place on December 30 last year and Mr Battle lay undiscovered at his home until early February.

His body was eventually found when neighbours started to get concerned and called police, who broke in and found his body.

Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said Richardson killed Mr Battle in rage when he refused to give him credit on gold to sell.

He told Teesside Crown Court that Richardson, of Norton, North Yorkshire, was on bail and desperate for money and went through his ‘little black book’ looking for easy prey.

Police believe Mr Battle, 56, may have lain dead in the lounge of his home for weeks before his body was found

On December 29 he went to Mr, Battle’s house hoping to get gold and rings on credit so he could sell them and when that didn’t succeed he returned the following day.

Mr Battle again refused and Richardson lost his temper and battered him with a heavy ornament, fracturing his skull, claimed the prosecutor.

Scientists allegedly found Richardson’s DNA on Mr Battle’s trouser hem, which the prosecution claims shows he moved the body after death.

His DNA was also found on a curtain allegedly used to cover a window and door to prevent people from seeing into the house.

The prosecution claims that Mr Battle’s blood was found in Richardson’s mother’s car which he used and tried to scrap after the death.

The prosecutor said Richardson was expected to claim that Mr Battle had been killed by another man and he had just ‘chanced on a treasure trove’.

He said he was pointing the finger at Darren Archer, 43, who is accused of carrying out a robbery of a gold dealer with Richardson three weeks before the murder.

But Mr Lumley asked: 'How could anyone who had nothing to do with the killing keep going back and going back in such close proximity to the body?'

Richardson denies murder and possession of Class A drugs, but admits theft of valuables belonging to Mr. Battle and robbery.

He is standing trial with alleged robbers Peter Anthony Egan, 48, and Archer, 43, both of York, who both deny robbery.

Archer is not charged with murder and the prosecution allege his phone records show he was in York at the time of the killing.

Mr Lumley said: 'In the space of three weeks, these three men, driven by the need and greed for money, and sometimes for drugs, were involved in serious crimes culminating in the killing of an innocent man.'

The prosecution claims all three robbed gold dealer Michael Cleaver of £4,100 in cash after Richardson lured him to York with false claims he had gold to sell.

They say Mr Cleaver was ambushed and threatened with an axe.

The trial continues.
