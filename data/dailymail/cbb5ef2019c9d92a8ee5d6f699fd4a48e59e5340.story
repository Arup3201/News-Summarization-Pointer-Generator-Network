Allegations: Alan Doggett, choirmaster at Colet Court - the prep school for St Paul's - has been named as six men who allegedly abused boys

A choirmaster who helped launch the careers of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice has been named as one of six teachers at George Osborne's former school who allegedly abused boys as young as ten over at least two decades.

The staff all worked at the prestigious St Paul's School in London - or its prep school Colet Court - between 1960 and the mid-1980s.

Alan Doggett became close to Lloyd Webber and Rice and later conducted recordings of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ 
Superstar and Evita.

But the choirmaster is 
believed to have been a serial abuser while teaching at Colet Court - 
even making sex attacks part of his choir's audition process for some boys.

He was allowed
 to quietly resign his post when a string of indecent assaults came to light.

Doggett was also an active member of the Paedophile Information Exchange 
(PIE), an infamous pro-child-sex group who wanted the age of consent 
lowered to ten.

After he left Colet Court he was given a job at the equally prestigious City of London School 
but threw himself under a train when he was charged with the indecent 
assault of a ten-year-old boy in 1978.

One of Doggett's alleged victims today accused St Paul's and Colet Court of 'hushing up' historic sex offences.

He
 said despite teachers being accused of abusing several pupils none of the four separate police 
investigations were never instigated by the schools.

Andrew Lloyd Webber told the Mail in 2012 he and Tim Rice were young struggling
 composers who 'got a call from Alan Doggett, who had taught Julian, my brother'.

Doggett
 asked them to 'write something for the kids’ end of term concert' and 
they chose the biblical story of Joseph, which had its first performance 
at Colet in March 1968. Four months later it was recorded at Abbey Road 
with the help of Doggett and the Colet boy's choir.

Help: Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1971 - three years after their first performance of Joseph at Colet Court, which later helped catapult them to stardom

Abuse: Doggett worked at Colet Court when it was based in Hammersmith, and allegedly touched boys inappropriately, including at choir auditions. Colet Court moved from here to Barnes for years ago

After Doggett's suicide in 1978, The Magpie, the Paedophile Information Exchange's magazine for members, advertised a 
memorial service for him and said he should be remembered for
 his ‘friendliness, integrity and loyalty’.

PIE's
 links to several leading members of the Labour party were revealed by the Mail last month, after it emerged
 the notorious group had extraordinary ties with the National Council 
for Civil Liberties - now known as Liberty.

Alan Doggett - choirmaster: Allowed to resign from Colet Court after being accused of abusing boys. Killed himself in 1978 after being charged with child sex offences at another school. Was member of Paedophile Information Exchange.

'Alex Alexander' - housemaster: Accused of beating boys for sexual pleasure. Police never involved and believed to be dead.

Patrick Marshall - rowing master: Arrested last month over alleged abuse of 15-year-old boy in late 1970s. He denies the allegations and has been bailed.

Rev Paul Topham: Accused of abusing boys but police inquiry in 2000 led to no prosecution. He denied all allegations and died in 2012.

Unnamed teacher: Allowed to leave school for 'family reasons' after violent porn found in room and register of boys he had beaten was discovered.

Unnamed teacher: Arrested in 2000 for abuse in late 1980s. No further action after CPS said there was a lack of evidence.

Today the St Paul's High Master Professor Mark Bailey
 backed calls for a new police investigation and said: 'All such 
allegations must be properly and fully investigated' and 'subjected to 
the proper processes of justice'.

An investigation by The Times has today shed light on historic abuse involving five other staff who may have assaulted dozens of boys at St Paul's or Colet Court over 20 years.

St Paul's and Colet Court are considered among Britain's most prestigious schools.

Chancellor
 George Osborne and Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC were there at the
 time of the alleged abuse but there is no suggestion either were 
victims.

Luke Redmond said from the age of 12 he was attacked by three teachers who touched him inappropriately or beat him for sexual pleasure.

He is now 59 and married with children and says he needed to speak out about his ordeal at school for 'closure'.

The allegations made by him and others involve Alan Doggett and five other staff, The Times' Chief Investigative Reporter, Andrew Norfolk has said.

The most recent claims were made about Patrick Marshall, a geography and rowing tutor at St Paul's, who was arrested in February over the alleged abuse of a 15-year-old boy in 1979 and 1980. He was bailed and denies the allegations.

Former Colet Court teacher Paul Topham, was accused of groping at least one child in his bed and forcing others to swim naked while he would touch them.

He went on to become an Anglican priest, but a 2000 police inquiry into sexual abuse allegations never led to a prosecution and he denied all the allegations. He died in 2012 aged 80.

Another teacher at Colet, known as 'Alex' Alexander,  would allegedly beat boys in his office with their trousers down and and then sit them on his knee 'until his face went very red', one boy said. He is presumed dead.

The fifth teacher - another unnamed member of staff - was caught with a stash of sado-masochistic pornography in his office and a register of boys he liked to spank. He was allowed to leave for 'family reasons', The Times said today.

Statement: St Paul's and its prep school said today it would help the police with any investigation into historic child abuse there

The sixth and final teacher, also unnamed, was investigated by police and arrested in 2000 after allegations of historic abuse in the late 1980s were made. But the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence. 

In a statement St Paul's said: 'The allegations do not relate to any pupils or staff currently at the Schools.

'Any sexual abuse of children by an adult—and particularly a teacher—is abhorrent, a serious violation of trust, and an affront to the values of any caring community. 

'Suspects should be investigated and subjected to the proper processes of justice'.

Alan Doggett killed himself after he was arrested and charged with child sex offences in 1978.

But Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice never forgot what the choirmaster did for their careers and also refused to accept he was guilty of abusing children.

Doggett had got to know the composers through Lloyd Webber's cellist brother Julian , who he taught at a Westminster Under School - a prestigious prep school.

After meeting Andrew, the Colet Court teacher invited the young writers to write a 'pop cantata' for an end of term concert.

Rice, then 22, and Lloyd Webber, 19, admitted they were forced to 'swallow their pride' in 1967 and agree, but the decision would change their lives.

Sir Andrew wrote in 2012: 'Frankly no one was much taken with our offerings but one day I got a call from Alan Doggett, head of music at Colet Court, St Paul’s junior school, who had taught Julian, my brother.

'Would I write something for the kids’ end of term concert? It had to involve all the school and be a story everyone knew. I called Tim.

'The first public performance of anything we had written would be on a Friday afternoon to an audience of bored parents, but after swallowing our pride, we agreed.

'At first we toyed with a James Bond story but decided that 007 might be a passing fad, so we thought about a bible tale.

'I had an excellent picture book called The Wonder Book Of Bible Stories. We chose the story of Joseph and his coat of many colours. It’s always easier to get stories for musicals from a picture book'.

By the summer of 1968 Joseph was being recorded at Abbey Road with the help of Doggett and the Colet Court boy's choir.

The following year allegations about sex offences led to the teacher's removal from St Paul's, but within a year he was back in a job elsewhere and teaching music to other boys.

Doggett worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber until 1976, and was 'musical co-ordinator' for an Evita album. He also was conductor on a recording of Jesus Christ Superstar.

But in 1978 he jumped in front of a train and left a note confirming it was 'best' to go 'the way of the Greek'. He was accused of abusing a boy, ten.

Soon afterwards, in a joint statement, Lloyd Webber and Rice said: 'Alan was a 
music and singing teacher of extraordinary talent. We have lost a 
gifted colleague and a dear friend.'

In Tim Rice's 1999 autobiograohy he said: 'I cannot believe that Alan was truly a danger, or even a minor menace, 
to the many boys he worked with'.

Lloyd Webber was said to have told friends: 'Doggett would never have been guilty of taking advantage of any young person in his charge'.
