A Canadian father ended up becoming paralyzed after choking during a competitive eating contest to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali.

Samaljit (Sunny) Aulakh has been laid up in a hospital bed unable to speak or walk since November. He can barely move his head.

The 36-year-old father of one fell to the floor after he choked on an Indian sweet.

Now the family say they are considering legal action to pay for Mr Aulakh's mounting medical bills.

Praying: Samaljit's family is still holding out some hope that he will recover

His family said he suffered severe brain damage after an eating contest in Surrey.

Tragedy struck after the dad took his son to a Diwali celebration.

He got up on stage to participate in an eating contest involving gulab jamuns, soft doughy Indian sweets.

'They called him the winner, and once he stood up, I guess he was choking on the food, which caused him to pass out and have a stroke, and from the stroke he now has brain damage,' niece Inderjeet Daleh told CBC News.

Son in shock: 'After my dad ate, he stood up and I think he felt dizzy and he fell down.¿ I felt very scared and I started to cry,' Pawan,10, said

His 10 year old son, Pawan, watched as the first ambulance arrived.

'After my dad ate, he stood up and I think he felt dizzy and he fell down.… I felt very scared and I started to cry,' Pawan said.

'I see him, he's all bluish and he can't breathe properly,' added wife Kamal Aulakh.

Aulakh's family said a second ambulance with equipment to clear his trachea had to be called for help.

He eventually ended up in a coma for ten days.

Hosts: Punjabi radio station Red FM cancelled the Diwali event after the tragedy

Possibly lawsuit: Niece Inderjeet Daleh says the family are considering a lawsuit after her uncle became paralyzed and rendered speechless

Shortly after the competition, Red FM, the Punjabi language radio station that held the contest, quickly shut down the event.

'If you're putting on a show like this, and having contests like this, you should have some kind of safety,' said niece Inderjeet Daleh. 'There should be some paramedics on site equipped and ready.'

Aulakh was not asked to sign a waiver of liability before entering the competition, Daleh said.

His family is still holding out some hope that he will recover.

In the meantime, they say they are considering legal action to get financial assistance to help pay for medical costs and Aulakh's eventual move to a long-term care facility.
