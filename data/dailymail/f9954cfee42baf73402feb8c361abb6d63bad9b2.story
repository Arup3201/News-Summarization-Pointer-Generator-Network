Inquest: Lance Corporal James Ashworth was killed by his own hand grenade when a sniper shot him as he was about to throw the device

A soldier who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after he died trying to rescue his comrades was killed by his own grenade, a coroner ruled today.

Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, of 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, was fatally injured by his own grenade after he was hit by a Taliban bullet just as he went to throw the explosive device into a compound in June last year.

At L/Cpl Ashworth’s inquest today Anne Pember, the Northamptonshire Coroner, said a post mortem had revealed cause of death as blast injuries caused by an explosion and recorded a verdict of unlawful killing while he was serving on operations in Afghanistan.

His bravery persuaded senior officers to recommend the soldier - known by his friends as a 'gentle giant' - for the VC.

The award stated: 'Despite the ferocity of the insurgent's resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten.

'His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack.

'This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.'

The VC has been awarded just ten times to UK soldiers since the Second World War. The posthumous honour to L/Cpl Ashworth, of the 1st Battalion the Grenadier Guards, is just the second from the 12-year conflict in Afghanistan.

The inquest heard how L/Cpl Ashworth died after crawling along the ground while being peppered with bullets to throw his last grenade at a sniper who had his team pinned down.

Speaking after the inquest in 
Kettering, his mother Kerry said her son, only the second soldier to be 
awarded a VC for bravery in Afghanistan, had died doing the job he 
loved.

She said: 'His smile can light up any room he goes into and we all love and miss him so.

'James
 passed away doing a job he loved. At times it was a hard job but he did
 get to experience new countries, learn new skills and make some 
wonderful friends.

'James will be forever be in our hearts, thoughts and prayers and we will never get over his passing.

'But
 we will stay strong together as a family and along with his friends we 
will remain positive and celebrate his life at every opportunity as I 
know that is what he would want us to do.'

His commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel James Bowder said he was 'the bravest of soldiers, the best of men'.

As well as the VC, L/Cpl Ashworth has had a square named after him in his home town of Corby.

The coroner heard sometimes emotional testimony from comrades fighting alongside L/Cpl Ashworth on the day he died.

His platoon commander Captain Michael Dobbin described how an operation had been ordered to 'kill or capture' a skilled Taliban sniper team which had shot and wounded three British soldiers in the preceding days.

After four days planning, the 
insurgents were spotted near a village in the Nahr-e-Saraj area of 
Helmand province, and the strike team, including L/Cpl Ashworth, swooped
 on the area in two helicopters.

Capt
 Dobbin said that with heavy fighting taking place elsewhere on the 
outskirts of the village, the compound 'had to be cleared'.

He
 said a number of options were ruled out before L/Cpl Ashworth 
volunteered to try to 'post a grenade' into the room where the insurgent
 was hiding

Capt Dobbin said there was no chance of help from a combat helicopter supporting the operation, or any point using a portable rocket launcher because his own men would be caught in the resulting blasts.

Using grenade launchers was also ruled out because trees near the doorway of the Taliban fighter’s position were blocking their line of sight.

'L/Cpl Ashworth suggested that if he moved along a low wall, he would be out of line of sight,' said Capt Dobbin.

'He was confident he could get the grenade in the doorway, allowing me and Capt Davis to assault the position.'Across the compound, L/Cpl Wint saw his friend 'Ash' 'crawling along the wall on his belt buckle'.

As L/Cpl Ashworth got near the 
doorway, covered by the low wall, L/Cpl Wint saw bullets pepper the 
ground inches from his friend and he called out 'Ash, get out of there'.

Still
 under fire from the insurgent, he said L/Cpl Ashworth 'did not 
respond'. There was an explosion, throwing up a cloud of dust, with 
L/Cpl Wint initially thinking his friend had triggered an improvised 
explosive device.

Capt Dobbin, waiting a few yards away, said both he and Capt Davis were surprised when they realised the explosion had gone off by L/Cpl Ashworth’s position.

'In the space of about two seconds we heard a cry of warning, then the rounds came in, then an enormous explosion,' he said.

He said there were 'no signs of life' from L/Cpl Ashworth.

The insurgent was killed some minutes later when he was flushed out with grenades and shot.

Award: Lance Corporal Ashworth was given a posthumous Victoria Cross. It is the UK's highest gallantry medal

L/Cpl Ashworth was airlifted and pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital at Camp Bastion.

A post-mortem examination revealed numerous 'blast fragment wounds' to his head and body, with forensic pathologist Dr Nicolas Hunt stating he 'would not expect him to survive' the wounds sustained.

He added that there would have been 'virtually instantaneous loss of consciousness'.

Dr Hunt also noted bruising to the heart caused by the blunt trauma of a bullet impacting on the soldier’s body armour.

Alan Hepper, an expert on the Osprey body armour British soldiers wear into battle, said the protective plate at the front of L/Cpl Ashworth’s vest had been fractured by a bullet, but it failed to penetrate.

The bullet was of the calibre fired from AK47-type weapons favoured by the Taliban.

Mrs Pember, giving her verdict, said: 'James bravely volunteered to throw the last grenade.

'He crouched down by a wall and sadly his body armour was struck by a single gunshot which knocked him to the ground.

'The grenade he had was already primed and detonated next to him.'

She added he was 'one of only 10 soldiers to receive the highest honour for gallantry since the Second World War'.

Unique: The Victoria Cross medal is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War

The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross.

Instituted
 by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most 
conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or 
self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the 
enemy.'

It is hand-made from bronze cannon captured from the Russians at 
the siege of Sevastopol in 1854-55 during the Crimean War.

The
 bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For 
Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of
 Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first 
medals were awarded.

The
 Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also 
to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy.

The
 medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a 
posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The 
Parachute Regiment, for acts of "inspirational leadership and the 
greatest valour" in southern Afghanistan in 2006.

Only
 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, 
nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army.

L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous.

Private
 Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal 
Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding 
gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered 
serious head injuries.

The
 Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three 
occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and 
Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander 
Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942).

The
 George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, 
recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians
 in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate.

These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.
