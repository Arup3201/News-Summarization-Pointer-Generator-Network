He celebrated the birth of his son late last year with his wife, 51-years his junior, and now former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards has decided to run for election to US Congress at the age of 86.

Edwards, a Democrat and four-term Louisiana governor, who served an eight-year prison term on racketeering charges, launched his candidacy for a seat currently held by Republican Bill Cassidy, who is running for the U.S. Senate.

'I've given a great deal of thought to this ... and I acknowledge that there are good reasons why I should not run ... but there are better reasons why I should,' Edwards told reporters at the press club in Baton Rouge, part of the district he is seeking to represent.

'I haven't had this much attention since the trial,' he quipped.

Edwards was accompanied by his wife Trina, who is more than half-a-century his junior and their baby, Eli Wallace , who was being looked after by Edwards' two adult daughters from his first marriage.

Edwards served two terms as governor in the 1970s and was re-elected in 1983. He then managed a comeback for a fourth term in 1991.

It was during that term that he came under federal scrutiny in connection with the state's licensing of riverboat casinos and was convicted by a jury on charges of racketeering.

Despite the convictions, the colorful politician still has strong support in the state.

Edwards, his wife and his daughters - both of whom are older than Trina - were the stars of a short-lived reality television show called 'The Governor's Wife'.

A felony conviction arising from the licensing of riverboat casinos in his fourth term led to eight years in prison. His announcement Monday came during a Press Club luncheon at a Baton Rouge casino.

 Edwards was the dominant figure in Louisiana politics for much of the late 20th century despite a series of scandals that resulted in numerous investigations and four federal trials, one of which resulted in conviction.

He retired from politics in 1996, before it became clear that he was again under investigation in the case that would result in his imprisonment.

 Before and after his prison term, he defended himself as a victim of an unfair federal judge in Baton Rouge, perjured testimony by former friends who had sought casino licenses and an overzealous federal government.

Federal prosecutors have denied all of those accusations.

Indeed, the political firebrand had his own reality show air on A&E which featured the quirky relationship between former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards and his 35-year-old wife Trina Scott.

The show's run ended after eight episodes.

The 51-year age gap is not the strangest part in the Edward’s unusual love story. The pair actually met while Edwards was serving time on racketeering charges.

The show featured the drama of the blended family and showcased how Edwards is picking up the pieces from the political shenanigans that landed him in prison.

Known for his charisma in politics, Edwards was sentenced to prison on racketeering charges in 2001.

He was in jail from 2002 to January 2011 for his role in a bribery and extortion scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses during his fourth term in the early 1990s.

Trina, who was in school at the time, picked up a copy of Leo Honeycutt’s biography of the former governor and became fascinated with her future husband’s story.

She began writing to Edwin who then arranged for her to visit him in prison.

Edwards explained how they met in an interview with Fox411. 'I was in the last year of my prison term…and after she read the book, she became interested in my career and asked to visit me.

And I arranged for her to visit me and after that we got to know each other well and she came to visit me every visiting day thereafter.

'And that’s an unusual story for a man my age and a beautiful young woman her age,' Edwards continued. 'But thank goodness it happened. They sent me to prison for life, look what I came back, a good-looking wife.'

Both Trina and Edwin admit their story is 'unique,' but insist their relationship works for them.

'My husband is an amazing husband,' Trina Edwards said. 'He’s a wonderful father. Our marriage is better than most people’s marriage when they’re the same age.'

'I don’t know how it happened or why it happened but I absolutely fell in love with him,' Trina said.

'And besides that, he doesn’t have as much money as most people think. So I’d be a pretty poor gold digger if that’s what I was in for.'

The show was billed as featuring the interesting dynamic between Edwards' other children.

Characters: The reality show featured Mr. Edwards. His daughters (center) Anna and Victoria are prominent along with Trina's two teenage boys (right)

He has four children by his first wife Elaine. Two of his daughters Anna and Victoria (who are now in their 60s), will appear on the show.

Anna is a 63-year-old, four-time divorcee, and Victoria is described as 'a hardened 60-year-old ex-showgirl.'

Scott also has two teenage boys, Trevor and Logan, from a previous marriage who will also be included in the reality program.

'People are going to be surprised at how normal in most respects our lives are,' the former Governor said before the show launched.

'And given, in spite of the fact that there’s this great difference in our age, the fact that I have 4 children over 55-years-old and now a 3-month-old baby and she’s got two teenage boys. A situation that the average person, not knowing or having been with us would raise his or her eyebrows and say that’s never going to work but believe me it has worked and I’m very proud of it.'
