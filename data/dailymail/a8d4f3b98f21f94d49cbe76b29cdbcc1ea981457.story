The devastated family of a disabled grandfather killed by a hit-and-run driver have told of their heartache at having to face Christmas without him.

Christopher Colegate, 69, who walked with the aid of two sticks, was knocked down on his way to his local Conservative club a week ago and left to die in the road.

A £1,000 reward has been offered for information about the callous motorist who failed to stop and has not been caught.

Mr Colegate’s daughter, Tash Motton, told a press conference at the club: 'We were really looking forward to Christmas. It should have been a happy end to what has already been a difficult year for the family.

'Now without dad, there will be an empty chair around the table on Christmas day and unopened presents under the tree.

'We now live with the knowledge that 
every Christmas is going to be a reminder of this tragic incident. The 
ache in our heart will never go away.'

The
 popular Poole pensioner’s two daughters made the impassioned plea as 
they sat with their mother, Freda, at Oakdale Conservative Club in 
Darby’s Lane, Poole, Dorset.

Despite suffering from a chronic disability which caused him to stoop, Mr Colegate played an active role in his community.

Rachel Hayward, Mr Colegate’s other daughter, said: 'An innocent husband, dad and grandad - Chris Colegate - was taken from us in such a horrific way.

'The collision itself may well have been a genuine accident but we are all struggling to come to terms with the fact that the driver of that car did not stop following the collision.

'The driver could have come to his aid; could have called for help but instead, thought only of themselves and selfishly fled the scene.'

She appealed for the driver to come forward and speak to Dorset Police.

'As hard as it is for our family, you also must be struggling to live with what you have done,' she said.

'What if it was your partner; your parents or your child? Could you really cope with that loss and the additional knowledge that the driver fled?

'If you were the driver, or you know who the driver is, please, please have the courage and decency to contact the police and come forward.

'It won’t bring dad back but it would give us a small crumb of comfort and help us to come to terms with what has happened.'

Sergeant Stuart Pitman, from Dorset Police’s traffic unit, said officers had seen at first-hand the impact of the hit-and-run.

'He
 had two grandchildren and we have had to explain to them why they won’t
 be able to see him this Christmas when they were looking forward to 
it,' he said.

'They were devastated.'

Grief: Mr Colegate's family (L-R) wife Freda Colegate , daughter Tash Motton and daughter Rachel Hayward, appealed for the killer to give themselves up to the police

Sgt. Pitman said officers were studying CCTV footage, conducting house-to-house inquiries and following up all leads in the case.

However, police have no description of the car involved.

'This driver would have known that they hit something in the road. I understand why they may be panicking at this time but to clear their conscience they need to hand themselves in.

'The net is closing in and we will find them.'

Police are also appealing for motorists in the area when Mr Colegate was struck at 7.25pm on Friday, December 13 to contact them.

'I am very keen to speak to the drivers of three vehicles - a family-sized grey or light coloured saloon; a medium-sized silver family car driving at speed along Heath Avenue, away from the scene; and a Honda Civic-type car turning from Darby’s Lane into Popes Road,' said Sgt. Pitman.

A pedestrian who walked past Mr Colegate moments before the collision was also urged to come forward.
