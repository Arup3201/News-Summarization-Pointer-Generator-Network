Mario Balotelli has nailed his colours firmly to the Liverpool mast ahead of this weekend's Merseyside derby at Anfield by singing songs about his new team while inhaling helium from a balloon.

The £16million summer signing uploaded a video onto his personal Instagram account of himself singing 'Liverpool, Liverpool, Liverpool.'

Balotelli is joined by a friend who laughs at the Italian's squeaky voice before the 24-year-old blurts out the same chant while taking in the last of the helium-filled balloon.

The former AC Milan striker is expected to be involved from the start against rivals Everton on Saturday, while his team-mate Daniel Sturridge is likely to be on the substitutes' bench.

Balotelli, who has been praised by his manager Brendan Rodgers in the build up to Liverpool's upcoming derby match, will be hoping to add to his goal tally.

The Italian scored in the Champions League against Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets but has yet to find the back of the net in the Premier League.
