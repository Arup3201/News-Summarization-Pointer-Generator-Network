An artist decided to put familial resemblance to the test by taking a half of a person's face and merging it with their brother, sister, mother, daughter, or best friend to see just how similar their features are when paired together.

Croation Artist Ino Zeljak, 27, exhibits his images in the series entitled, Metamorfoza, and says he did so to explore the, 'similarities and differences between people that are connected genetically or with relationship.'

By using Photoshop to blend the two faces into one, Zeljak is able to create faces that look they belong to one person but upon further glance are noticeably two people.

Brother and sister: Both these photographs are of a brother and sister and while they both appear to be similar, the photo of the younger brother and sister on the right is almost indistinguishable

Sisters: Both these images are of two sisters blended together and while they look alike, the biggest difference can be seen in their eyes

Some of the photos are of people genetically related while the others are just of friends.

The 
Huffington Post reports that in order to take the photograph, he used 
similar lighting and when blending the snapshots he duplicated the hair 
and clothing of his subjects to make them appear uniform.

At
 first glance, the photos look like they might be of one person. However
 the artist says that, ‘when you look at it a bit closer you see 
something different and strange.'

In the photo of a brother and sister it almost appears as if the photographic subject is lifting his eyebrow when in reality, the arched brow is the more feminine feature characteristic of the man's sister.

Peas in a pod: the photo on the left is of identical twin sisters while the one on the right is of best friends though they both look very similar, begging the question of whether or not non-familial relationships might be based on similar genetics

In a merge of a brother and sister who are still children, the face is indistinguishable.

A
 photo of twin sisters looks the most alike out of all the images but is
 due to the fact that the twins have the most similar genetic makeup.

The
 photo of best friends shows that even though people may not be 
genetically related they are drawn to one another as friends due to 
their genetic similarities.

The eyes of the merged best friend  image are different colors but the ears, eyebrows, and jawline are almost identical.

A very interesting merge between a mother and daughter show similar features that have been changed by age.

According
 to his Behance website, Zeijak studied as an undergraduate studying 
Environmental Science at faculty of Science in 2010 and was later 
accepted to the Academy of the Dramatic Arts for photography and 
cinematography.

Sisters and brothers: The photo on the left is of two sisters and the photo on the right is of two brothers and while they look similar the placement of their eyes gives the secret that they are two people away

Mother and daughter: Perhaps the most noticeable difference between faces is that of a mother and a daughter who have similar features but still appear different because of their age
