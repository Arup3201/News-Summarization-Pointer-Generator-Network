David Cameron today promised to take a 'tough approach' on negotiations with insurers over homes in danger of flooding as pictures emerged of its devastating effects in a town that has already been hit once this year.

Residents in Tewkesbury are once again counting the cost of being hit by flooding from the River Severn and its tributaries following heavy rainfall - and it's just five years since the town was home to similar watery scenes.

As a result people in the town could face excess on their damage claims of £20,000 as well as a rise in their insurance premium but the Prime Minister has said he will come down hard on insurers who fail to provide affordable cover.

In 2007 Tewkesbury Abbey became a symbol of the town's plight as water crept ever closer to its foundations and now it looks like the town is suffering from the same fate.

This time, however, the river was expected to peak at 4.8m - one metre lower than the peak five years ago.

As this is the third time that the 
town has witnessed such flooding insurers will once again facing picking
 up the bill for damage done to many buildings.

In turn it is likely that home and 
business owners will face a rise in the amount they pay for their 
interest and, more worryingly, a rise in the amount they pay for their 
excess.

In 2007 a couple in Powick, 
Worcestershire, had their house flooded twice in the same summer. Chris 
and Wendy Wreghitt were told their insurance excess would be £20,000 
after a 4ft wave of water washed across the road through their home.

The six-bedroom detached house 
suffered hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of flood damage to the 
kitchen, living room and study.

At the time Mr Wreghitt, 53, said Axa
 dealt with them efficiently but when he went to renew his home 
insurance a year later his premium jumped from £1,000 to £1,638. Then in
 2009 it more than doubled to £3,747. Initially Axa said their excess 
would be £20,000 but once he complained it was lowered to £10,000.

There is hope, however, after Prime 
Minister David Cameron today promised to take a 'tough approach' on 
negotiations with insurers over homes in danger of flooding.

Up to 200,000 high risk properties are
 at risk of being priced out of affordable cover when a deal struck in 
2000 between the then Labour government and insurers ends next summer. 
The Government has been in talks for two years but as yet an agreement 
has not been reached.

'I'm sure we will do a deal,' Mr Cameron said. 'We are in negotiations at the moment.

'We need to take a tough approach 
frankly and it's important insurance companies do what they are meant 
to, which is provide insurance to households and we are going to make 
sure that happens.'

Mr Cameron said he was determined to reach an agreement. 'I am personally involved,' he said.

'(Cabinet Office Minister) Oliver 
Letwin is doing this negotiation on my behalf. The current situation we 
have lasts until the middle of next year and we have some time to sort 
it out.

'But I want to get it sorted. I've 
seen myself in my own constituency the difficulty people have when they 
can't get insurance. It's not just it makes them feel unsafe in their 
own home but they can't sell their own home, so it's very important we 
get this sorted on their behalf.'

David Cameron has vowed to get tough on insurers who charge people too much for cover for when they are flooded

Mr Cameron was speaking after he met 
householders in the village of Buckfastleigh, Devon, which was struck by
 flash flooding at the weekend.

'It is obviously very traumatic when 
communities are hit by flooding like this but what I found are people 
are incredibly steadfast and have behaved incredibly bravely at handling
 the flood and now we need to help them with the recovery,' he said.

'We have to make sure their insurance 
pays out, make sure the Environment Agency puts in place good flood 
defences, make sure there are better warning schemes. There are always 
lessons to learn and I wanted to come here and hear it for myself.'

Mr Cameron also visited recently-built
 flood defences on the River Dart, which have helped protect the local 
area from worse flooding. The Prime Minister defended his Government’s 
record on providing flood defences despite a cut in the budget.

'We are spending over £2 billion on 
flood defences over the current four-year period, which is 6% less than 
was spent over the last four years,' he said. 'But as well as that, we 
are actually encouraging private and other money into flood defences and
 making sure they are more efficient as we build them.

'I am quite convinced we are going to 
provide flood defences for another extra 145,000 homes over the period 
ahead and that’s very important.'
