Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham was killed when he was ejected from an aircraft while it was on the ground at RAF Scampton

A Red Arrows pilot died of multiple injuries after ejecting from his aircraft and landing while still strapped into his seat, an inquest has heard today.

Flight Lieutenant Sean James Cunningham, 35, was killed when he was ejected from his Hawk T1 while on the ground at the Red Arrows base at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire on November 8, the coroner at Lincoln Registration Office heard.

The inquest was told that Flt Lt Cunningham had completed ground safety checks when the ejector seat of his Hawk jet was deployed.

The main parachute did not deploy and the pilot did not become separated from his seat during the incident, the hearing was told.

He landed on the ground still strapped into his seat.

An ambulance was called and Flt Lt Cunningham was taken to Lincoln County Hospital where he was confirmed dead in A&E at 12.14pm.

A post-mortem examination was carried out and the cause of death was given as multiple injuries due to a fall from height following ejection from an aircraft.

Toxicology tests were performed and came back negative.

After the incident the Ministry of 
Defence banned flights by warplanes fitted with the ejector seats 
involved in the accident.

A full investigation into how the 
ejector seat deployed is being carried out and further tests are being 
done, the inquest heard.

Det Supt Shaun West, from Lincolnshire Police, told the inquest they were investigating the incident and were preparing a file for the coroner.

He said there were two critical questions they were investigating - why the ejector seat activated and why the parachute mechanism did not do what it was reasonably expected to.

He said they were using experts to help them examine the ejector seat.

Paramedics were called to the team's world-famous aerobatics base in 
Lincolnshire earlier this month after the incident involving one of the 
display team's Hawk T1 aircraft

Mr West said Lincolnshire Police were
in regular contact with Flt Lt Cunningham's family, none of whom were 
present at the hearing.

Coroner Stuart Fisher adjourned the inquest to a later date but said it could be 'months' before it is reopened.

Military top brass took the decision 
to suspend the Hawk, Tornado GR4 and Tucano fleets from the air except 
for ‘non-essential’ flying as tributes poured in for the airman.

Operations in Afghanistan and the defence of Britain were not be affected but training programmes were hit, said the MoD.

The suspension affected RAF aircraft 
fitted with Martin Baker Mk 10 ejection seats, which are the Tornado 
GR4, the Tucano and the Hawk.

According to Martin Baker, the Mk.10 seat is designed in four main units, catapult, main beam structure, seat pan and parachute assembly.

On its website, the company says: 'This greatly simplifies and speeds maintenance or cockpit access.

'The seat can be rapidly installed or removed by assembly or disassembly of the main units in the aircraft.

'As the aircraft canopy is not removed, valuable maintenance time is saved.The overall size footprint of the 10L seat has been tailored to suit a large number of aircraft installations.

An
independent investigation by the Military Aviation Authority will focus
on whether the accident was caused by a technical malfunction or pilot 
error.

Flt Lt Cunningham joined the world-renowned Red Arrows last year and flew in air shows over the summer.

He
was the second Red Arrows pilot to be killed this year. Flt Lt Jon 
Egging, 33, died in August when his jet crashed after an air show in 
Bournemouth.

Earlier this year, Flt Lt Cunningham told how 
he had achieved his schoolboy dream of joining the Red Arrows.

Speaking to his local paper in May, he
said: ‘Being on the Red Arrows team has been my dream job and something
I have wanted to do since I can remember. I remember seeing them on the
telly and thinking I want to be able to do that.’

Flt Lt Cunningham qualified for his 
private pilot’s licence when he was 17.

He joined the RAF in 2000 after 
studying electrical and electronic engineering at the University of 
Nottingham.

Concerns about the ejection seats recurred when Flt Lt Egging was killed after the Bournemouth Air Show in August.

Minutes earlier his wife Dr Emma 
Egging had watched the breathtaking performance. Witnesses who rushed to
the crash site in a field near the village of Throop found his body 
floating in the River Stour with the ejection seat a short distance 
away.

Flt Lt Cunningham joined the Red Arrows last year at the same time as Flt Lt Egging.

He grew up in Binley, near Coventry – 15 miles from the Warwickshire village of Ufton where Flt Lt Egging was raised.
