A Polish man has been left critically injured after he allegedly blew up his house when he realised his wife and children had gone on a picnic without him.

Czeslaw Kaminski, 69, was believed to have been so incensed when he woke to find a note from his wife to say that she had gone away for the day with the children that he decided to destroy the family home to teach her a lesson.

He allegedly started a fire in the basement of his home and threw two gas cylinders on top of the property in the village of Chechlo Drugie, near Lodz, in central Poland.

The 69-year-old failed to leave in time and was caught in the blast

But he failed to leave in time and was caught in the blast when the house was blown up.

He was taken to hospital by an air ambulance where his condition was described as critical.

Hospital spokesman Bozena Kozanecka said he was in a coma in intensive care.

The man's wife Grazyna said: 'He called me on the mobile home and demanded that I go home, but when I refused he said he was going to get revenge.

'I did not take him seriously and then I returned home to find this.'

Neighbours told local media that the couple's relationship was excitable and that there was often heated arguments.
