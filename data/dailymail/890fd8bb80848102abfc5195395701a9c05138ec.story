At first glance, you’d never guess this bright coral coat cost £20. However, the wool-look fabric does feel synthetic. With the spotlight on your colourful coat, wear darker trousers — this crepe pair are a bargain — and a neutral jumper with a scarf rolled into a ring to hide any badly stitched ends. It’s hard to believe these faux suede boots are £5.

The right colour can make or break a coat — mustard is stylish without showing off. The textured fabric and oversized pockets look high end. Wearing the collar up adds to the effect, as will pairing it with a super-soft scarf. With such a chunky coat, aim for a slim silhouette with fitted jeggings (jeans crossed with leggings).

Camel is the fashionistas’ favourite colour for this season, but this coat’s classic good looks will last several winters. You can tell these trousers are expensive. Half-lined with a tapered shape and well-cut pockets, they create a tailored look. For a pop of colour, wear with a subtly textured jumper. A classy outfit requires classy boots, and designer Ben de Lisi’s input shows here. The Burberry-esque scarf completes the illusion of a designer outfit.

When it comes to coats, details make the difference. This M&S version not only feels soft thanks to the wool and cashmere, but the silky lining, drop shoulders, fitted bust and internal pocket all merit the price tag. The trousers have a streamlined flat front. These leather boots are built to last, while the ‘cashmink’ scarf completes the look.

This soft wool and cashmere blend coat is a flattering length, has pretty lining and quality buttons. The scarf may be part cashmere, but doesn’t warrant such a high price tag, while the jumper is reasonably priced for pure cashmere. Cheap-looking buttons and rivets let down the jeans. The boots can be ordered in different width fittings — which doesn’t come cheap.
