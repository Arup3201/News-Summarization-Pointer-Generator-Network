From winking about a 67-year-old sex worker to bringing back the budgie smugglers - it's been a bumpy year for Tony Abbott.

The Prime Minister will mark his first 12 months in office this Sunday on Father's Day.

And while it will be a cause for celebration, it also presents the opportunity to reflect on some of Mr Abbott's more memorable missteps since last year's federal election.

How time flies! It's 12 months since Tony Abbott took the top job and he's been busy putting out fires at home and abroad

Perhaps appropriately Mr Abbott finds himself overseas at the moment, in India, for he has been lauded for his handling of some international affairs - particularly the tough stance taken with Russia over the MH17 tragedy and most recently the humanitarian involvement in northern Iraq. 

But the former rugby union prop has also been guilty of dropping the ball at home and abroad.

The list of faux pas ranges from winking when, during a radio interview, a pensioner told him she had to work on a sex line, to effectively telling the Scots to pull their heads in, as they seek independence.

And yes, there was that rather awkward impromptu interview on morning television, in all his budgie smuggling glory.

But it was when he took to the air-waves to discuss Budget matters with Gloria the Grandmother, where the Prime Minister was truly exposed.

The eyes have it. One wink is all it took for the PM to be dragged into a public relations disaster when he seemed to make light of Gloria the Grandmother's predicament

She told how the planned $7 GP co-payment and increased cost of medication would leave her out of pocket up to $850 a year.

'I would like to ask you if you'd like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation,' she said.

'I'm a 67-year-old pensioner with three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life-threatening.

'I'm just surviving on around $400 a fortnight once I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. That's the only way I can do it.' 

It's what Mr Abbott did on hearing Gloria's phone sex admission that put his public standing in a spin - the Prime Minister clearly winking at radio show host Jon Faine.

Mr Abbott has not only butted heads with battlers but the big names have also taken a shot at him.

The claim he made a few years ago that climate change was 'absolute crap' has come back to haunt him on an global scale.

English actress Emma Thompson had a very clear message for the Australian Prime Minister on climate change, as she travelled through the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign

British actress Emma Thompson slammed the PM for failing to act on climate change while travelling through the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign.

The Oscar winner appeared in a photograph on a Greenpeace ship near the Smeerenburg glacier, holding a sign which read: 'Tony Abbott climate change is REAL I'm standing on it!'

A second photograph featuring the 55-year-old, saw her holding a second sign with the words: 'Where I stand should be ice'.

Ahead of becoming prime minister, Mr Abbott had been prone to the most notably shrugging off the death of Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney in Afghanistan by suggesting to soldiers 's*** happens' and pointing out the 'sex appeal' of female candidates.

A noted monarchist, the PM won few friends in Scotland last month when he said: 'As a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it's hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland'.

The pro-independence Scots were having none of it, ahead of their September 18 poll.

'Tony Abbott has a reputation for gaffes, but his bewildering comments have all the hallmarks of one of the Westminster government's international briefings against Scotland, a spokesman for Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said.

'Many Australians, including the great number with close Scottish connections, will look on in bafflement at these remarks - Australia is a country that has gained its independence from Westminster and has never looked back.'

At least his Canadian gaffe was little more than an embarrassing slip of the tongue.

At an Ottawa media conference he said: 'They're very forthright remarks, and I think that they're perfectly appropriate remarks for the Canadian Prime Minister to make. Canadia, Canada, probably has more involvement in the affairs of Europe than Australia often does.'

'Tony Abbott has a reputation for gaffes', so said the Scots when the PM bought into their push for independence

The relationship with Indonesia was strained, to say the least, when it was revealed Australian spy agencies had spied on that country's president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. When details were revealed of how his mobile phone had been tapped by officers, Mr Abbott's reply was not as conciliatory as Indonesia had hoped. 

'Australia should not be expected to apologise for the steps we take to protect our country now, or in the past, any more than other governments should be expected to apologise for the similar steps they have taken,' Mr Abbott said.

'Importantly, in Australia's case, we use all our resources including information to help our friends and allies, not to harm them.'

He went on to say that the surveillance was 'reasonable'.

Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono made his protests known on Twitter

SBY sought a clear public response from his Australian counterpart

The Indonesian President was clearly very unimpressed by Tony Abbott's 'belittling' of the spy scandal

On the home front, Mr Abbott struggled to keep the nation's indigenous leaders on-side during a recent speech, by repeatedly stating that the arrival of the First Fleet 'was the defining moment in the history of this continent'.

'It was the moment this continent became part of the modern world. It determined our language, our law and our fundamental values. Yes, it did dispossess and for a long time marginalise Indigenous people,' Mr Abbott said.

'As Noel Pearson frequently reminds us, modern Australia has an important Indigenous and multicultural character. Still it's British settlement that has most profoundly shaped the country that we are.'

But Warren Mundine, chairman of the Prime Minister's own Indigenous Advisory Council, fired back that white settlement was in fact 'a disastrous defining moment for indigenous people'.

Matilda House, head of the Stolen Generation Council for NSW, also disapproved.

'I can't fathom how a ship or a boat sailed into Sydney Harbour can overtake the 60,000 years before.'

But it was when the Prime Minister tried to tackle the issue of home-grown terrorist sympathisers, with a call to arms under the 'Team Australia' banner, that social media went into meltdown.

'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia,' Mr Abbott implored.

'Everyone has got to put this country, its interest and its values and its people first.'

Twitter exploded into action once the PM had made the 'Team Australia' remark

Plenty of tweets provided novel ideas of just who, instead of Tony Abbott, should lead 'Team Australia' 

The 'Team Australia' call was the source of countless satirical tweets

Australians will no longer have the 'right to be a bigot'. 

This was a back-flip which backfired, as the Abbott government dropped from its controversial plan to overhaul the Racial Discrimination Act.

The backlash from ethnic community leaders and from within his own party led to the PM and his Attorney-General George Brandis admitting defeat on the so-called 'Bolt Laws'. Almost overnight he went from being seen as too hard to being too soft.

Back-flip on the 'right to be a bigot' laws. Both the PM and his Attorney-General came under fire, externally and internally, over their plans to change the Racial Discrimination Act 18C and their subsequent backdown

There's been a few wrong turns. Mr Abbott chats with Treasurer Joe Hockey in the House of Representatives. Mr Hockey has had a trying 12 months too, including the infamous 'poor people don't drive' gaffe, comments which the PM quickly distanced himself from

Perhaps just as damaging within the party room was the Melbourne trip scandal, which led Bill Shorten to claim the PM was 'not fit to govern'.

The Prime Minister was alleged to have told party colleagues the reason he was late to a meeting was that he had organised a last-minute trip to a cancer clinic to 'justify billing taxpayers' for the trip.

And one other broken pre-election promise which hasn't gone unnoticed was his pledge not to be caught swanning around in his Speedos.

But there here was in his favourite swimwear, fresh out of the surf and fending off questions, in the most awkward of breakfast television interviews.

The noted fitness fanatic, insisted in a radio interview that he had the necessary energy levels for the top job.

Mr Abbott visited a cancer clinic during a trip to Melbourne last month amid accusations he told party room colleagues that it was organised so he could 'justify billing taxpayers'

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten claimed that Tony Abbott was 'not fit to govern' in the wake of the revelations regarding his Melbourne trip

'I’m lucky in that I’ve got quite a bit of stamina, I don’t need more than six hours sleep a night,' he said.

'I can bound out of bed at five o’clock in the morning, I find I can go through the day 'til about ten o’clock pretty comfortably.'

The Opposition pounced, arguing that a Prime Minister who doesn't realise that 10am to 5pm is actually seven hours, can't be trusted to balance the books. 

It's been a tough 12 months.
