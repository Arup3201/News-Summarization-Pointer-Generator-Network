The manager of a GPs’ practice who stole more than £158,000 from the firm has been jailed for nearly three years. 

John Pepper, 62, used the money for foreign holidays, a new car and a £5,250 model railway.

During an eight-year period, he also amassed £20,000 of savings and investments, Isle of Wight Crown Court heard.

His thefts started in August 2005 – a year after he began work as the £30,000-a-year manager at Dower House Surgery, Newport – and continued using the practice’s bank card to withdraw cash until a colleague noticed last September. 

During that period, Pepper, with a previously unblemished record, used the practice’s bank card to withdraw cash and he disguised the transactions by falsifying invoices to make the books balance, said Christopher Stopa, prosecuting. 

In all, he stole £158,340 over the eight months he had been offending, which began with small amounts, but escalated to larger sums year on year thereafter.

Pepper told the police he had been heavily in debt, around £50,000, and that he was glad he had been caught.

Judge Susan Evans sentenced Pepper to two years and eight months in jail and ordered him to repay the money or face another two years.
