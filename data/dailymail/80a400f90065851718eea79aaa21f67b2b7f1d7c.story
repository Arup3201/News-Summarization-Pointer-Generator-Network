For 12 months Erik Lamela could not hit a barn door with a banjo, but on Thursday the Argentine came up with a wonder goal to show why Tottenham shelled out £30million for his services.

The 22-year-old scored a stunning 20-yard 'rabona' goal for Spurs in their Europea League tie against Asteras Tripolis, causing team-mate Ben Davies put his hands on his head in sheer amazement.

The only person who wasn't moved by the spectacular effort was manager Mauricio Pochettino, who showed no emotion as his coaching staff leapt to their feet.

The Argentine manager has been credited with helping his fellow countryman rediscover his form following disappointing first season.

Lamela arrived at White Hart Lane from Roma in August 2013, having scored 15 goals in Serie A the previous season.

His arrival paved the way for Gareth Bale’s £86m departure to Real Madrid and inevitable comparisons were drawn between the pair.

But while Bale excelled at the Bernabeu, winning the Champions League and the Copa del Rey in his first season, Lamela toiled in England.

But Lamela has begun to show glimpses of his talent this season and he scored again in the 66th minute with a crisp first-time volley.

Harry Kane went one better by scoring a hat-trick in a 5-1 victory.
