Thai police have taken the term gun dog to a whole new level - with barking mad results.

Not only has this Labrador been trained to serve with the Thailand police force, it has also been entrusted with its very own weapon.

The animal was seen carrying the automatic in a holster strapped to its side.

And its master was even happy to pose with the gun-toting animal.

Witnesses said the armed dog guarded officers as they ate their dinner at the Dusit Hotel in Pattaya, Thailand, on Tuesday.Â 

The Labrador certainly looked happy to have risen to such a position of responsibility within the force.

And to prove he had the right to carry arms, the dog's holster was marked 'Police K-9'.

Since the photographs emerged online, many people have raised concerns about the safety of the bizarre scene.

However, others questioned whether it was simply a stunt for the camera.

Navies, military forces and police forces tend to use Labradors as detection dogs thanks to their calm temperament and keen sense of smell.

Their sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin.

The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who helped save his master Allen Parton's life in 2001 after he had been knocked from his wheelchair by a car.

He was voted Dog of the Millennium and given the PDSA's coveted Gold Medal - the canine equivalent of the George Cross - for dragging Mr Parton into the recovery position, pulling a blanket over him and running to a hotel barking for help.
