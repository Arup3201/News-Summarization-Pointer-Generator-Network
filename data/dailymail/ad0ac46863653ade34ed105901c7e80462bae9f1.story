Leeds United are a step closer to naming Darko Milanic as their new head coach after Sturm Graz confirmed their manager's departure. 

The 46-year-old negotiated his release from his contract with the Austrian club over the weekend and is travelling to England for further talks to finalise terms with Leeds owner Massimo Cellino.

The Slovenian, who can speak five languages, was targeted at the beginning of last week after it became clear to Cellino that he could not find a British coach suitable to his demands.

Milanic took charge of Graz for the final time against SV Josko Ried on Saturday evening before saying his goodbyes. The club posted 'All the best, dear Darko' on their official Facebook page on Sunday.

Shortly before Sturm Graz beat SV Ried 1-0 in the Austrian Bundesliga on Saturday, a statement published on their official Facebook page read: 'Darko Milanic has received an offer from Leeds.

'Sturm have also been presented with a request from England. But now we concentrate fully on the game. We will say more on Sunday.'

Speaking during the match against Ried, Sturm general manager Gerhard Goldbrich told diepresse.com: 'Milanic has a tremendous opportunity in England. We do not want to punish him.' 

Milanic is understood to have a clause allowing him to buy his way out of a three-year deal with Graz and he should sign the contract at Leeds tomorrow.

Leeds have been without a head coach since sacking David Hockaday on August 28.

Various names such as Robbie Fowler, Chris Cooper and Oscar Garcia had been considered before Cellino settled on Milanic.

Academy manager Neil Redfearn will take charge of today’s Yorkshire derby against Huddersfield Town, his fourth game in charge, before making way for Milanic.

Milanic has been head coach of Sturm Graz for the past year and previously won nine domestic titles with Slovenian side Maribor.
