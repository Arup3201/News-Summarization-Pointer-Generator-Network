A police dog has attacked four people, including a teenage girl, after it escaped from its handler's home.

The 13-year-old girl needed hospital treatment after she was bitten on the arm and leg by the German Shepherd.

The dog, which had escaped from a kennel whilst off-duty, also attacked two men who had rushed to the girl's aid.

Taylor Smith, 18, was bitten on his arm, while 47-year-old cafe owner Alastair Driver suffered scratches and had his shirt ripped as he tried to fight off the dog.

Another man had been attacked half an hour earlier after the dog broke free from an officer's home in Glossop, Derbyshire

Mr Smith, 18, said that he was at home when he heard the girl screams as she was being mauled by the police dog.

He said: 'It had its jaw locked on her forearm. A man from a nearby cafe came out and put a knife sharpener in its mouth so it would release her and he managed to get her into the cafe.

'The dog ran off but then it came back and jumped up and locked on my arm.'

He eventually managed to push the dog off and it was recaptured by its hander after a three hour search of the town.

Investigation: Police have launched a probe into how the dog was able to escape from its kennel at the home of its handler in Glossop, Derbyshire and attack four people

Mr Driver said that he had been terrified, and described the dog as being the size of 'a wolf'.

The attacks happened on Thursday evening and police have launched an investigation into the incident.

Derbyshire Police said that the animal belonged to a dog handler with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and that it had escaped from its kennel at the officer's home.

A GMP spokesman confirmed that the officer had not been suspended following the attack, and that Derbyshire police would be looking into the circumstances of how the dog was able to get out of its kennel.

The animal was being kept in 'secure accommodation' while the probe was being carried out.
