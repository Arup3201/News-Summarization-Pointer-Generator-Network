Fans of 'Parks and Recreation' have been waiting most of the season to see if Amy Poehler's character, Leslie Knope, would leave Pawnee, Indiana, for a new job in Chicago at the National Park Service.

On last night's season finale, it was First Lady Michelle Obama that gave her that final nudge.

The former Chicago resident had a run in with Poehler's character in at the National Parks conference in San Francisco, telling a starstruck Leslie, 'Well, you know how I feel about Chicago.'

Michelle Obama swung by 'Parks and Recreation' last night to give career advice to Amy Poehler's character on a possible move to Chicago

'You are from Chicago, so you like,' it, 
Poehler's Leslie fumbles out in response before ending their exchange on
 this bit of praise: 'I agree with you on all things throughout history 
and till the end of time, forever.'

The appearance gave Obama ample opportunity to plug her Let's Move! initiative, which aims to end childhood obesity through exercise and healthy eating.

Inspired, Poehler's character decides to take the new position with the National Park Service and move to the Windy City.

But in a last minute twist, it's revealed that she convinced her new bosses to move the national headquarters to Pawnee so she can stay in her beloved hometown.

Obama was just one cameo in an episode packed with surprise guest appearances from stars like Ginuwine, who performed at the Pawnee/Eagleton Unity Concert as a favor for cousin Donna.

Thanks to Obama's advice, Poehler's character took a new job but managed to stay in her beloved hometown of Pawnee

He dedicated his 1996 hit 'Pony' to the town's deceased mascot, pony Little Sebastian.

Also performing were The Decemberists and 90s alt-rockers Letters to Cleo.

Mad Men star Jon Hamm even stopped by as an inept employee Poehler fires three years after taking the new job, now married to Ben, triplets at her side.

While fans have said the packed show felt more like a series finale than the end to a season, Parks and Recreation will return for at least one more year.
