Content: Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the reports would inform the debate on staying in the EU

A major government review into the Brussels influence in Britain has concluded there is little to worry about.

William Hague's study into the so-called ‘balance of competences’ found that the current relationship between Britain and the EU was 
broadly fine.

But the claim provoked a damning response from Tory MPs and the UK Independence Party who dismissed it as 'a futile and cynical PR exercise'.

The Prime Minister ordered the studies as part of his promise to re-negotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership.

He plans to reach a new deal after the election before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

But the first six reports of 32 to emerge from the balance of competencies review suggest that there is little to complain about.

Overall, more than 500 submissions were made to government during the consultation stage of the reports, which took up to eight months to draw up.

One official said today: 'We are happy with the overall balance of evidence.'

The report on tax said: ‘Respondents and interested parties were content with the current balance of competence on taxation.’

Another finds that integration has brought to the EU and the UK ‘appreciable economic benefits’ while a report on animal health for found that the ‘internal market produced real benefits for the UK’.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell wrote on Twitter: ‘Europhile Whitehall elite says EU membership is a good thing – SHOCK.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'Problem number one is that the Conservative Party does not really want to repatriate important powers to the UK. Cameron has said he will vote to stay in the EU come what may.

'Problem number two is that their interlocutors in Brussels are unwilling to transfer powers as well.'

However Foreign Secretary William Hague said the reports were an essential contribution to the debate on Britain's EU future.

He added: ‘At a time when the EU is facing considerable challenges and discussion on the EU in Britain is intensifying, it is vitally important that the debate in the UK is as well-informed as possible,’ he said.

‘These reports make a valuable contribution, not only to the debate in this country but also to the debate taking place in other European nations about the future of the EU.’

Threat: One report warned that turmoil in member states could allow the EU's foreign service, headed by Baroness Ashton, could attempt to increase its control

The reports, drawn up by officials, do not make recommendations but attempt to summarise how the EU both helps and hinders the UK.

The report on foreign affairs raises concerns about the performance of EU institutions such as the diplomatic service - the external action service headed by Baroness Ashton.

‘If the internal conditions of EU external action deteriorate, how will that affect our choices of how to deliver international impact in the British interest?’ the report asks.

‘If the institution's performance does not improve, or if there is an undesirable shift in control away from the member states, such as a greater role for the European Parliament, how will we alter our approach, what will the constraints be, and how will we use or develop our other partnerships and alliances as alternative vehicles?’

The report on health raised concerns about the impact of EU regulations - such as the working time directive (WTD) and data protection laws - on the NHS.

‘There was a strong view that it is important to consult more with health departments and their stakeholders on these areas from the outset. A number of concerns were raised about the negative impact of the WTD on the NHS,’ it said.
