A police investigation is underway in Auckland after a New Zealand newsroom was sent a vial claiming to contain Ebola in a suspected hoax.

A New Zealand Police spokeswoman said the liquid in a small plastic bottle was sent to the New Zealand Herald mailroom in a suspicious package on Tuesday morning.

It was secured by Auckland City Police and will be sent to Melbourne for testing, she said.

The vial is being forwarded to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, after it was sent to the office by a 'jihadist group', Sky News reported.

The NZ Police spokeswoman said: 'The package contained some documents and the small plastic bottle.

'One of the documents made mention of Ebola. As a precaution, the bottle and its contents were secured by police and transferred to [the Institute of Environmental Science and Research] where it will be swabbed for DNA and checked for fingerprints before being sent to Melbourne for testing.'

Results are expected within days, but police believe there is little threat to the staff who handled the package.

'Police are often called to deal with and investigate the origins and contents of suspicious packages,' Detective Inspector Scott Beard said. 

'The vast majority of them turn out to be benign but we don’t take any chances. This is no exception.'

New Zealand Herald group marketing director Liza McNally confirmed that an unaddressed package was sent to their Auckland office on Tuesday.

'When that occurred protocol was followed and it is now a police matter,' Ms McNally told Daily Mail Australia. 

A spokesman for the NZ Ministry of Health told Daily Mail Australia that they were assisting a police investigation in Auckland.

'There's no Ebola case in New Zealand,' he said. 

The Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, located at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, is charged with testing all suspected Ebola samples in Australia and New Zealand.
