In an incomprehensible twist of fate, a Queensland woman who lost her brother in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 discovered on Friday that her stepdaughter was on the plane shot down over Ukraine. 

Kaylene Mann's brother Rod Burrows and sister-in-law Mary Burrows were on board flight MH370 when it vanished in March.

On Friday, Ms Mann found out that her stepdaughter, Marie Rizk, was killed along with 297 other passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which U.S. intelligence authorities believe was shot down by a surface-to-air missile.

'It's just brought everyone, everything back,' said Greg Burrows, Ms Mann's brother.  'It's just ... ripped our guts again.'

Mr Burrows said his family was struggling to understand how they could be struck by such horrible luck on two separate occasions with the same airline. 

'She just lost a brother and now a stepdaughter, so...' he said of his sister as his voice trailed off.

Marie and her husband Albert, from Melbourne, were returning home from a four-week holiday in Europe, said Phil Lithgow, president of the Sunbury Football Club, with which the family was heavily involved.

Mr Rizk, a real estate agent, was a member of the club's committee, and his wife was a volunteer in the canteen and their son, James, plays on the club's team.

Ms Mann's other brother Greg Burrows said the double tragedy: 'ripped our guts again'

A total of 298 passengers were killed on the flight which U.S. intelligence authorities believe was shot down by a surface-to-air missile in Ukraine

'They were very lovely people,' Mr Lithgow said. 'You wouldn't hear a bad word about them - very generous with their time in the community, very community-minded, and just really very entertaining people to be with.'

The club members planned to wear black armbands and observe a minute of silence to honor the Rizks at their game on Saturday, Mr Lithgow said.

Despite the double tragedy, Greg said he holds nothing against Malaysia Airlines.

'Nobody could predict they were going to get shot down,' he said. 'That was out of their hands.'
