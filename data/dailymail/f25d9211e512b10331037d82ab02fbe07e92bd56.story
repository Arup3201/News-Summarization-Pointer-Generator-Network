A Ferguson cop is being sued over claims he hog-tied a 12-year-old boy while he checked his family's mailbox. 

Officer Justin Cosma had a civil rights lawsuit filed against him in 2012 after he and another cop Richard Carter allegedly left the child with choke marks around his neck, cuts and bruises in June  2010. 

Cosma was reportedly part of a group of Ferguson officers who arrested two journalists who were in a McDonald's restaurant earlier this month amid the riots over the cop shooting of Michael Brown.

Officer Justin Cosma had a civil rights lawsuit filed against him in 2012 after claims he hog-tied a 12-year-old boy outside of his family home

The lawsuit alleged that while Cosma was working with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, he became 'confrontational' with the child while investigating reports of a boy playing on the highway, the Huffington Post reported. 

The child denied that he had been playing on the road however, according to the suit: 'Unprovoked and without cause, the deputies grabbed [the boy], choked him around the neck and threw him to the ground. The boy was shirtless at the time, and allegedly 'suffered bruising, choke marks, scrapes and cuts across his body.'

The lawsuit also claimed that the child was 'hog-tied'.

The 12-year-old was treated at a medical center. The two cops reported the incident as 'assault of a law enforcement officer'. Prosecutors refused to take up a juvenile case against the child. 

The lawsuit was brought by the boy's family in September 2012, soon after he joined the Ferguson force. It is unclear why he left the Jefferson County Department. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the family's lawyer today and from Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson. 

The lawyer previously said he expected a trial date to be set for early next year. 

The Huffington Post reported that Cosma was one of the officers who arrested one of their own reporters and another Washington Post journalist at a McDonald's in Ferguson during the riots - but refused to give his name or badge number. 

At least ten journalists were arrested or detained since Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was killed August 9 by Ferguson officer Darren Wilson.

Wilson is on leave and has gone into hiding pending the outcome of a civil rights investigation into the shooting death of the 18-year-old.
