A decorated military commander, hailed as one of Britain's greatest, has been accused of molesting children while serving as the Queen's representative in Australia.

Field Marshal William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim, has been accused of abusing the youngsters who attended a school for underprivileged children.

Victims in Australia have come forward, claiming they were abused by the First and Second World War veteran, who died in 1970 at the age of 79.

School: The majority of pupils at Fairbridge Farm School, of which Viscount Slim was a patron, were British migrants

The Telegraph reported Bob Stevens, has filed a lawsuit against Fairbridge Farm, a school near Pinjarra in south western Australia.

Mr Stevens claims Viscount Slim would arrive at the school in his Rolls Royce and 'the next minute we were sitting on his knee and he's got his hands up our trousers'.

The majority of pupils at the school were British migrants. Mr Stevens was sent to Fairbridge from England at the age of eight.

He has given testimony in private to Australia's royal commission into child abuse.

The former pupil is also preparing to apply to the commissioner to have Viscount Slim stripped of his peerage.

Another former student, David Hill, who has written a book about the school and is former managing director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said he is aware of two other boys who claim they were also molested by Viscount Slim.

The alleged abuse happened while Viscount Slim was serving in Australia as Governor-General from 1953 to 1960.

The claims came to light as 65 alleged victims of abuse took action against Fairbridge Farm School, of which Viscount Slim was patron.

Mr Stevens said the abuse he suffered at the hands of Viscount Slim 'has never left me and it can't leave me'.

He told ABC news: 'He used to visit Fairbridge and we were all in some cases given rides in his Rolls-Royce car.

'I don't care how brilliant a man he might have been militarily, if he abused children the way I was abused and others, I don't think people like that have the right to continue... in terms of peerage that goes on from family to family to family. I think that it's outrageous.'

Viscount Slim fought in both world wars. He led the Fourteenth Army, the so-called 'Forgotten Army' to victory against the Japanese in Burma during the Second World War.

Lord Mountbatten labelled him 'the finest general World War II produced'.
