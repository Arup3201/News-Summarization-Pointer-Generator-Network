Injury: Lindsay Hawkins, 28, is in a coma after she was thrown from her horse Murphy (also pictured) when a gang of teenagers started throwing stones at the frightened animal

A mother of two is fighting for life in a coma after she was thrown from her horse when a gang of stone throwing teenagers ambushed her on a quiet country ride along a private track.

Lindsay Hawkins, 28, was riding her 
seven-year-old Shire Gipsy Cob cross Murphy on a private track in Wickersley, South Yorkshire, when it 
was attacked by three or four yobs.

The horse, who is 16.1 hands high, reared up and tried to run off, throwing Ms Hawkins to the ground.

And the teenagers, aged around 13 to 15, fled as they saw her fall, without stopping to check how she was or help her.

Ms Hawkins, who has two children, aged eight and four, was rushed to Rotherham Hospital where a scan diagnosed her with bad concussion and she was allowed home after two days.

However, later that day she was re-admitted to hospital where she underwent surgery for a bleed on her brain - and is now in an induced coma while her family wait anxiously by her bedside to see how she recovers.

She is critically ill.

'Lindsay is such a beautiful, lovely, kind-hearted and funny young woman who is the best friend you could wish for,' said friend Sarah Jane Binder, 33, who owns the livery where Ms Hawkins keeps her two horses.

'She’s an adoring mother who has two amazing children who are a credit to her.

'If anyone has any information about who is responsible for this I’m urging them to come forward.

'Look what’s happened as a result of this prank the teens have played - they didn’t mean for this to happen but someone needs to take responsibility for it.

'The doctors have told Lindsay’s family that it’s just a matter of waiting to see how she recovers when she comes out of the coma.

'She’s had damage to her brain stem, the part that controls her breathing, so she’s on a ventilator at the moment.

'The family are coping as best they 
can, looking after Lindsay’s two little children, but as you can imagine
 it’s an extremely worrying time for them.'

Ms Binder said her friend had taken Murphy out that day because it had been his birthday.

'She would normally ride with someone else but on that day because of timings she took him by himself,' she said.

'She hadn’t been away for long when Murphy turned up at the livery. My parents - who own the livery with me - were there at the time. They went out to look for Lindsay and found her - she’d actually just got up from where she’d fallen.

'She told them that about three or four youths had been throwing stones at Murphy, who’d got scared and reared, then tried to run away. She fell off but the kids just ran away without stopping to see if she was ok.

'They called an ambulance and then my dad rang me to come down, and I went with Lindsay in the ambulance to Rotherham hospital. She was quite disorientated but managed to tell me what had happened. She kept sort of drifting in and out of sleep.'

Ms Binder said that a hospital x-ray revealed she had no broken bones, although a scan showed that she had suffered a concussion.

'They kept her in for 48 hours and then let her go,' she said.

Emergency:  Ms Hawkins underwent surgery for a bleed on her brain - and is now in an induced coma while her family wait to see how she recovers

'But on the day she came home, she started getting headaches which were getting worse so she went back to hospital.

'They found she had a bleed on her brain so sent her to Sheffield Hallamshire Hospital, where she had an operation the next day.

'She’s been in a coma since then to reduce the swelling on her brain, she’s on a ventilator too.

'The doctors have said it’s just a case of waiting to see how she improves. It’s critical she’s making improvements.'

Ms Binder said her friend was a skilled horsewoman, who had been riding since she was around five years old.

'I’ve known her for about ten years so she’s a friend as well as keeping her horses at our livery,' she said.

Starting point: Ms Hawkins had set off from this livery in Wickersley on May 17 when she was thrown from her horse

'I’m frustrated, mad and very upset about the whole thing.

'We’ve been using that path for ten years and we’ve never had any trouble. If anyone has any information please tell the police'

Police were today appealing for information to track down the teens following the attack at around 5.45pm on May 17.

Officers have carried out enquiries in the Wickersley area in a bid to trace the youths, including a search on the day of the incident, but have so far been unable to find those involved.

'We are urging anyone who might have seen what happened or who has any information about the incident to come forward,' said Detective Inspector Steve Ashmore, of South Yorkshire Police.

'We’re also interested in hearing from anyone who has suffered similar problems in the area and will be visiting local stables.

'This incident shows the serious consequences of antisocial behaviour.'
