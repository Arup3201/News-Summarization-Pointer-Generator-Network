The widow of comedian Richard Pryor has slammed embattled Bill Cosby, describing him as a 'piece of s***' who 'had sex with everything that moved'.

Jennifer Lee Pryor also branded the 77-year-old a hypocrite on the podcast  'Alison Rosen is Your New Best Friend' in a scathing attack on the star following the resurfacing of historic sex abuse allegations against him. 

The two comedians started their careers as bitter rivals, with Cosby accusing Pryor of copying his technique. However they are believed to have become friends when Pryor changed his act after two years away from the comedy scene. 

'Had sex with everything that moved': Jennifer Lee Pryor branded the 77-year-old a hypocrite on the podcast ' Alison Rosen is Your New Best Friend'

She said: 'Bill … hated Richard because he "worked dirty". Bill worked clean, so therefore, you know-Bill's just a f*****g hypocrite and dirty on the inside.' 

'It was a well-kept secret that Bill f*****d everything that moved,' she added. 'This kind of s*** that we're finding out about is beyond.

'I wasn't aware of this kind of business. There are people in the business who were aware of it and they're coming out now.'

The pair married in 1981 but divorced just 14 months later. However they tied the knot again in 2001 and stayed together until Pyror's death in 2009 at the age of 65. 

During the damning interview, she also insisted Cosby's wife Camille knew about his alleged lurid behavior all along.

She said: 'Of course she knew. Why is she going for the "okie-doke," as Richard would say? That's anybody's guess.'

Finally, referring to the state of his career, he said: 'He's done. Yea. He's done.'
