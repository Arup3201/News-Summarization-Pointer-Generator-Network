The question for the owners of West Ham United is how long will they allow themselves, and their club, to be made to look ridiculous?

It is no longer that West Ham are bad. That could be said of any struggling club in any league in any sport. There are a lot of bad teams about, every year. What is happening at West Ham is bad cubed. Maybe bad to the power of 10. Beyond bad, in fact.

There is playing lousy football and going for 11 goals in the space of four days. There is poor form and there is conceding 22 goals over six matches. West Ham look ridiculous. Therefore David Sullivan and David Gold look ridiculous, too.

Where does it end? The Championship is the obvious and flippant answer to that but, if West Ham’s fate is to fall from the Premier League, there are months to go before this financially and politically catastrophic consequence occurs. In the meantime, how far becomes too far? 

How long will the two Davids, as they are known, have to suffer scorelines that are personally and professionally embarrassing before they act? The owners promised a different team, a better team, after the January transfer window but increasingly that appears empty rhetoric.

West Ham thought they had Everton reserve John Heitinga — who has started only two games, both in the Capital One Cup, this season — earlier in the January transfer window, but were rebuffed. They thought he had a better offer from a Premier League club, but were wrong there, too. He simply didn’t want to sign for West Ham — and he won’t be the last. 

It is surely not insignificant that only Roger Johnson, late of twice-relegated Wolverhampton Wanderers and an unsuccessful loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, has rallied to the cause so far.

West Ham’s disastrous run is making them the least attractive proposition in the Premier League. At this stage last season, Queens Park Rangers attracted France’s striker Loic Remy. Such a signing could save West Ham’s season, but could the club hope to pull it off now? 

What player of the necessary quality would join a club who lost 5-0 to Nottingham Forest with the reserves and then 6-0 to Manchester City with the first team? Don’t be ridiculous. So he is a lucky man, Sam Allardyce. Much like England’s cricket coach Andy Flower, he has contrived to collect the plaudits for his management nous in the good times, yet avoided the taint of overwhelming failure in this leanest of years.

Thumping: West Ham have shipped 11 goals in two games after losing to Nottingham Forest 5-0 on Sunday

Fed up: One young supporter was captured by ITV cameras in floods of tears at the City Ground

Flower is the man for this crisis, we hear after England’s 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia, which rather ignores that, for such a top-drawer motivator and manager, he entirely failed to anticipate it or reverse the nosedive once it came. 

The same with Allardyce. He makes great play of his ‘Sam Allardici’ alter ego when results go well, but this present crash is being met with the regular recital of an injury list that, while debilitating, does not represent sufficient mitigation for an almost complete defensive collapse.

Unstoppable? Edin Dzeko fires City's sixth goal home in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg

In vain: Allardyce bellows at his players from the bench during the thrashing on Wednesday evening

'At City, it was almost as if West Ham 
accepted their fate with a collective shrug. With full backs and 
emergency loanees in the team, what else is there to do but lose 6-0? 
Quite a lot actually.'

Allardyce juxtaposed his free-transfer full back George McCartney having to play in the centre against Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko on Wednesday night and reeled off the injuries to Winston Reid, James Collins and James Tomkins as justification for such a feeble display. 

Yet West Ham have conceded three goals or more on 10 occasions this season — and in six of those games Allardyce has had two of his front-line centre halves available. Collins and Reid played against Everton on September 21 (lost 3-2), Reid and Tomkins against Manchester City on October 19 (lost 3-1) and Collins and Tomkins faced Norwich City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, conceding a total of 13 goals as a partnership in those four games.

Injuries have taken West Ham’s defensive frailty to dismal new levels, but no Premier League team have received such regular batterings this season. Fulham have conceded three or more goals on eight occasions; Sunderland on five, Crystal Palace three. West Ham, remember, 10.

In addition to this, it is worth remembering that Chelsea won a Champions League final against Bayern Munich with Jose Bosingwa at centre half. Isn’t that what coaches are supposed to do: re-organise, react or, at least, limit the damage? 

At City, it was almost as if West Ham accepted their fate with a collective shrug. With full backs and emergency loanees in the team, what else is there to do but lose 6-0? Quite a lot actually.

Keeping the tie alive would have been a start. It is hardly edifying for the club to have to adjust ticket prices for the return leg in a forlorn attempt to attract an audience for what should have been one of the most in-demand and eagerly anticipated matches at Upton Park in recent memory. 

They cannot even sell the game on the presence of world-class opposition. What sort of team will City field on the night? The reserves, with a few first-team players on the bench just in case a couple of early goals go in?

That is a tactic that might have served Allardyce better at Nottingham Forest last weekend, when youth followed inexperience into battle, like a bad First World War re-enactment.

As embarrassment piles on humiliation for the owners — who have twice broken West Ham’s transfer record on Allardyce’s behalf — removing the manager is no guarantee of survival. Yet neither is keeping him any more. 

The motivation for maintaining the status quo would appear to be financial — Allardyce’s pay-off is believed to be above £4million — coupled with a perceived shortage of replacements. Yet the same logic saw West Ham sleepwalk over a cliff under Avram Grant in 2011.

Back then, as the void appeared before them, West Ham’s directors skipped a match at Manchester City, which ended in a 2-1 defeat. Had they attended they would have witnessed the moment when a sudden gust of wind in the tunnel scattered Grant’s notes, which he comically struggled to retrieve. ‘Like something out of a Jacques Tati film,’ said a passing cineaste.

And, yes, it was a ridiculous sight; but it was never more ridiculous than this.
