Joe Cusker, 59, became the 10th Clutha disaster victim when he died in hospital today

A tenth person has died in hospital nearly two weeks after a helicopter crashed into a pub.

Joe Cusker, 59, died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary yesterday as officials grounded nearly half of the UKâ€™s air ambulances when investigators discovered a fault.

Mr Cusker, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, is the seventh person to have died from inside the Clutha pub, Glasgow, along with two officers and a pilot in the aircraft.

The Police Scotland helicopter that crashed through the roof of the bar on November 29 was a Bond-operated Eurocopter EC135 Type 2 aircraft. Now Bond has grounded 22 EC135 helicopters in the UK as a precaution while the issue is examined.

The Association of Air Ambulances (AAA), which represents the majority of the air ambulance network, said 16 of its 36 helicopters in the UK were affected by the grounding and were subject to safety checks yesterday.

Other air ambulances still in operation will be used to cover the areas currently affected by the grounding, AAA said.

Director Clive Dickin said: 'The safety of the aircrew and general public is of primary importance and we are supporting Bond Air Services and Eurocopter who are working closely together to investigate and resolve the technical problem.

'Aircraft of all types occasionally are grounded for bad weather or routine maintenance. In these circumstances, other air ambulances and ambulance service providers work closely to ensure no patients are affected.

'Obviously, when an extremely rare incident like this happens, stresses can be placed on the services and however these contingencies are planned for.'

An air operator has grounded an entire fleet of helicopters - the same model which crashed on a pub, killing nine people - after a defect was discovered on a recent flight

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'Bond Air Services has taken the decision to ground the EC135 fleet. In the meantime, Police Scotland will have air support emergency cover provided by military colleagues.'

An initial report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued this week said there was 'no evidence of major mechanical disruption of either engine' of the Police Scotland helicopter as it returned from an operation in Dalkeith, Midlothian, on the night of the crash.

A statement from Bond Air Services 
said: 'During normal operations yesterday, one of our EC135 fleet has 
experienced an indication defect that requires further technical 
investigation.

'Therefore as a precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended service operations whilst we undertake detailed diagnosis.

'We
 commenced investigations overnight, are continuing this morning and are
 in close liaison with Eurocopter regarding this investigation.'

Recovery: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has found both engines 'flamed out' during the  flight

The helicopters are used by air ambulance and police forces throughout the UK.

It is understood the defect was found in a helicopter used by the North West Air Ambulance service.

A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: 'Bond Air Services advised on Wednesday evening that, as a precautionary measure, it was temporarily suspending flights of its fleet of Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, including Scotland's two air ambulance helicopters.

'The safety of patients and air ambulance staff is the number-one priority and Bond has taken the decision following a reported technical fault on one of the company's EC135s operating outside Scotland.

'Until the matter is resolved, the Scottish Ambulance Service is operating normal contingency measures whereby any patient that requires transfer by air will be taken by Coastguard and military helicopters, Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance helicopter or SAS fixed-wing aircraft.'

The helicopter that crashed in Glasgow hit the flat roof of the Clutha pub with a high rate of descent and with low or negligible forward speed, the special bulletin from the AAIB revealed.

The weather was good and the helicopter still had 95 litres of the 400kg of fuel that it had taken off with from Glasgow City Heliport.

Mission: The report added that the cause of problem was not clear - with 76kg (168lb) of fuel left in the helicopter's main fuel tank when it crashed.  Above, rescue workers lift the helicopter wreckage from the bar

The pilot of the helicopter, David Traill, and his two passengers - police officers Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins - were killed in the crash along with six people inside the pub.

Lynda Brislin, chief executive of the North West Air Ambulance Charity, said: 'On the advice of our aircraft supplier, all three North West Air Ambulance craft, along with all other air ambulances using the same aircraft in the UK, have been temporarily suspended from service.

'We are in continual dialogue with our provider as to when the service will be resumed and are hoping to be operational again as soon as possible. While the matter is investigated, our paramedics and clinical staff are deployed in rapid response road vehicles within the region continuing their vital work saving lives.

'We are unable to provide further information regarding the nature of the suspension at this time as tests are currently ongoing, but we will keep everyone informed as and when details become available. At this time there is no link to any other incidents and this is a precautionary action.

'NWAS will continue to work with other aircraft fleets, including Yorkshire and Great North Air Ambulances together with Air Sea Rescue and Coastguard, and will deploy the most appropriate service available. Our focus, as ever, remains to increase patient chances of survival through rapid response and treatment.'

A statement from the British Airline Pilots' Association said: 'Pilots are looking to the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to take charge and provide the industry with the information that has informed the decision to ground the Bond EC-135 fleet.

'Flight safety is best served when there is transparency and openness and these developments leave everyone asking 'Why?'.

'This grounding confirms our belief that a fundamental review about how helicopter operations are regulated is needed; a point we will be making forcefully to the House of Commons Transport Select Committee in their upcoming helicopter safety inquiry.'
