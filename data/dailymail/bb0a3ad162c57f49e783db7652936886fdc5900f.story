The New York townhouse featured prominently in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's has been placed on sale for $8million.

The home, which is located at 169 East 71st Street in Manhattan's affluent Upper East Side neighborhood, is where Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly lived and threw parties.

Though the building was used only for the film's exterior shots (interior shots were done in a studio), its iconic stoop, front doors, and architectural accents are immediately recognizable. The only visible difference is the disappearance of green- and white-striped awnings over the windows.

You there, Holly? The Manhattan home where Audrey Hepburn's character lived and entertained is on sale for $8million

'Any time they had a street scene, the house was featured,' said Asher Alcobi of Peter Ashe Real Estate to Today.com. 'The signature olive green doors are still the same.

'The house is on the tourist tour of the Upper East Side.' 

The 3,800-square-foot, four-floor home has four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a greenhouse, and a garden duplex apartment with its own entrance. 

It was sold to its current owner in 2012 by Peter Bacanovic, the former Merrill Lynch broker who served five months in jail for aiding his client Martha Stewart in insider trading in 2004. 

Realtors recently dropped the price by 20per cent, but the $8million price tag is still a significant increase from the house's 2012 selling price: $5,850,000. Mr Bacanovic reportedly bought it for $1,880,000 in 2000. 

The brownstone, which was built in 1910, has undergone two major renovations since the film was made, once in the mid-80s and again in the late-90s. Still, the exterior remains largely untouched.

In Breakfast at Tiffany's, Holly Golightly, a young New York socialite,lived with her no-name cat at the residence. 

Her upstairs neighbor is Mr Yunioshi, a Japanese photographer, played by Mickey Rooney. Another neighbor is Paul Varjak, played by George Peppard, who eventually becomes her love interest. 

Ms Hepburn's role in the movie is generally regarded as the most significant of her career. Interestingly, the author of the novella the movie is based on, Truman Capote, wanted the role to be played by Marilyn Monroe.

Breakfast at Tiffany's was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay. It won Best Original Score and Best Original Song for Moon River. 

The film reportedly cost $2.5million to make, and grossed $4million at the box office (then considered a success) when it was released. Over its lifetime, it has made approximately $14million.
