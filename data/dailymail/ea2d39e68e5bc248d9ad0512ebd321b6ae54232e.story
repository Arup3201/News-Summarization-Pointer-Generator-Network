This is the moment a drunk passenger stripped naked on the airport tarmac and begged the captain for a fight before he had to be tasered by police.

The 52-year-old holidaymaker, who had arrived in Manchester on an easyJet flight from Malta, also urinated up the side of the Terminal One building in front of a shocked crowd.

To add insult to injury the burly, bald man was slapped across the face by his fuming girlfriend before police officers fired 50,000 volts into him after he refused to calm down.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

'Come on then!' A passenger had to be tasered after he stripped naked when he left a plane and then challenged an easyJet captain to a fight

Had enough: This sequence shows how after his bizarre behaviour his companion stood up to him and smacked him round the face in an incident caught on camera

Trouble began mid-flight when the traveller, who appeared drunk, became abusive and started swearing at fellow passengers.

A witness who asked not to be named said: 'He'd had an altercation with other passengers and the captain had come down the plane to calm him down.'

But on landing at Manchester at 1.28pm, the passenger's bizarre behaviour continued. 

After coming off the plane, down the steps and on to the tarmac, he stripped to his black underpants and gestured towards the pilot.

Video shows him then stripping completely naked before getting a slap across the face from a woman.

The witness added: 'He must have been drunk because when he came off the plane, he took his top off and shouted "come on then" in a Manchester accent and was trying to get the captain to fight him.

'Then he carried on taking all his clothes off. I have no idea why. The woman he was with gave him a slap for it.' 

In trouble: Witnesses described how the 52-year-old had been abusive on board the flight before standing in only his pants yelling up to the cockpit

Set to: The man speaks to air staff on the ground with his clothes on this time but then he started taking them off and yelling

The man put his clothes back on before entering Terminal One, where police arrived at 1.40pm.

They tried to control him but resorted to using a 'dry' Taser - where the gun is held against the target to cause shock and pain - when he refused to co-operate. He was then arrested and escorted from the airport.

Police confirmed they received a call on the morning of September 26. 

A spokesman added: 'Police were called to Terminal One arrivals of Manchester Airport following reports a man was drunk and being abusive to passengers on a flight from Malta.

'As he left the plane, he took his clothes off and urinated against a wall.

'A 52-year-old man was dry tasered and arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in a public place. He was issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice.'

An easyJet spokesman said: 'The passenger had arrived into Manchester on flight EZY1328 from Malta. 'The safety and security of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority and, like all airlines, disruptive behaviour is taken seriously.

'The passenger was met by the police as a result of his behaviour.'
