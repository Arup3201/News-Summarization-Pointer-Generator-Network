BBC bosses racked up a bill of £1million of fee-payers' money on 13,000 first class rail tickets in just three years, it has been claimed.

New figures obtained under a Freedom of Information request revealed annual spending by the Corporation soared by £76,000 between 2011 and 2014.

It came in the same period that BBC shows, including Breakfast and Match of the Day, were moved to new studios in Salford with many staff members commuting between Manchester and London.

The average cost of a ticket was £73, although the BBC refused to disclose details of another 205,000 rail tickets claimed back by staff, according to The Sun.

Andy Silvester, a spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'It's time to hit the brakes on this licence fee funded gravy train.

'The £145 TV tax is a big hit for hard-working families and the corporation shouldn't waste it.'

But a BBC spokesman said: 'Staff are permitted to book first-class train tickets if they cost the same or less than a standard rail fare.' 

The revelations came to light after the BBC struck a deal with ticket agents to allow staff to book first-class fares more cheaply, it is claimed.

It comes after BBC bosses were also accused of racking up hotel bills of more than £3.5million in the first two years after the move to Manchester.

The £224m Salford project was billed as a way to save costs and boost the BBC’s audiences in the North. 

But it has been mired in controversy amid claims some staff did not want to move, despite relocation packages of up to £150,000. 

In 2012 Gary Linekar was caught up in BBC travel controversy after it was uncovered that the Corporation had been spending more than £15,000 a year to cover his travel to work. 

After finishing each Match of the Day show, the presenter - who earns £2million - has a chauffeur waiting to drive him from the Salford studios to his home in London.

The BBC also paid for the former England captain’s first-class train ticket from London to Manchester to begin filming each week. 

The Corporation and Linekar's agents refused to comment at the time.
