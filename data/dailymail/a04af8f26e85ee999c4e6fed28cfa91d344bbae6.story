Piling on to a crammed Tube during the morning rush hour can be a gloomy way to start a winter's day, but pranksters have come up with a way to bring a smile to commuters' faces.

Cheeky stickers have been slapped over the information signs on London Underground trains, showing a spider's web spanning the Central Line and Shepherd's Bush station renamed Shepherd's Pie.

Transport for London's priority seat labels have also been replaced by stickers reserving spots for smelly commuters, drinkers, and even Her Majesty the Queen.

The comedy stickers include this one showing a spider web on the Central Line

A blue sticker modelled on TfL priority seat signs features a picture of a crown and the words 'Royal seat: By appointment to Her Majesty Queen's bottom'.

Other tongue-in-cheek stickers have been used to designate a 'drinking seat', for Tube passengers who want to 'get absolutely red signalled', a Harry Potter-inspired 'sorting seat' for those who need advice on where to go, and even an electric chair for smelly commuters.

One label shows Oxford Street station renamed as 'Nightmare on Elm St', and indicates that passengers should change here for connections to Heaven or Hell.

According to another of the comedy stickers, which appeared on a Facebook page called Stickers On The Central Line, lonely commuters can use the Tube to travel from 'Single' to 'In a Relationship' in a single stop with no changes.
