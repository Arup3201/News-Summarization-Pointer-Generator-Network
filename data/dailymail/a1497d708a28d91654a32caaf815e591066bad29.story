This was NOT meant to be part of the show.

A photographer is lucky to be alive after being thrown yards into the air by a raging bull at a rodeo.

The snapper, who was carrying a large long lens camera, was up-ended at the annual Royal Horse Show in Toronto, Canada, before crashing down as the crowd gasped.

The bull then charged off leaving the man lying on the arena floor.

Cowboys who were part of the show and medical staff then rushed to him and, amazingly, seconds later he got back on his feet before being helped off.

Toronto's annual horse show is in its 91st year and attracts some of the best riders from around the world.

This year it featured the Ontario Toyota Dealers Royal Rodeo, which showcased bull riding, bronc riding and barrel racing.
