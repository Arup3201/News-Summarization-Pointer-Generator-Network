On his first night in North Korea, government officials were already telling Matthew Miller to get out.

'We want you to leave on the next flight,' he says he was told after his arrival, but the 25-year-old California native refused, sticking to what he claims was his plan to see what conditions were really like as a prisoner in Pyonyang.

'My main fear was that they would not arrest me when I arrived,' Miller told Washington-based NK News after he his release earlier this month, helped along by a visit to North Korea from US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

Though outlets such as the Washington Post later speculated that Miller was being used as a 'bargaining chip' in negotiations with the US, North Korea was originally hesitant to take him.

Released: Matthew Miller, 25, is welcomed back at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington after his release from detention in North Korea

After arriving in the country in April with an intentionally damaged visa, Miller says he stayed in the Yanggakdo International Hotel for two weeks as government officials continued to urge him to leave.

It wasn't until his third week in the country when Miller was moved to anything resembling detention, being taken first to a 'guest house,' the same location as another American prisoner, Kenneth Bae.

But in spite of being held for 210 days in custody, Miller was treated to a rather welcoming reception in North Korea as American officials worked out his release.

'This might sound strange, but I was prepared for the ‘torture’ but instead of that I was killed with kindness, and with that my mind folded and the plan fell apart,' he said. 

Miller said he was allowed to hold on to his iPad and iPhone for 'at least a month' after his arrival, though communication was restricted.

While Bae, who was accused of plotting to overthrow the North Korean government, faced conditions that were described as 'hard labor,' Miller says he still had access to certain comforts.

Prisoner: Miller explained his greatest fear was not being arrested after entering North Korea pretending to be a tourist and intentionally damaging his visa

'I became very friendly with my translator,' Miller said. 'We met everyday and would have conversations. We would play billiards together.'

On trial: Miller was charged with 'hostile acts' against the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea and sentenced to six years hard labor in September

Hard labor: Miller described speaking with his translator and playing billiards during early parts of his trip to North Korea, though he was eventually moved to a detention facility, where he was ordered to move stones

In September, he was formally convicted of 'hostile acts' against the country entering 'under the guise of a tourist' and sentenced to six years of hard labor and sent to a detention facility on the outskirts of the capital.

'It was kind of a farm place,' Miller said. 'They had all control. I would go out to work to move stones, take out weeds.'

The American's experience in custody contrast sharply with reports from defected North Korean prisoners, who have reported being severely beaten or forced into stress positions, according to The Atlantic. 

Media accounts of Miller have struggled to clarify his story, which has been further muddled by Miller's own attempts to conceal his identity.

A fuller picture of the American detainee emerged after a Reuters investigation was published in September. 

Before his detention, the outlet revealed, Miller spent months in South Korea posing as an Englishman named Preston Sommerset.

During that time, he recruited and paid artists to produce an anime adaptation of Alice in Wonderland before entering North Korea through China.

Miller also described writings in his notebook, which were circulated in state media, as crafted to convince government officials to arrest him.

In them, Miller portrayed himself as a hacker with ties to WikiLeaks and referenced plans 'to remove the American military from South Korea.'

'Perhaps the notebook was a little too much over the top,' Miller later said. 'They instantly knew it was false and wanted to know my true purpose of visiting.' 

After twice canceling trips by US special envoy for North Korea Robert King, Pyongyang negotiated Bae and Miller's release through Clapper last week. 

Miller claims the trip was a personal success, allowing him the opportunity to glimpse what life is like for North Koreans, though he says he understands at what price it came.

'I wanted to meet North Korean people face to face in a way that a normal tour would not be enough,' Miller said. 'I spent a good five months having many conversations with various people.' 

'My trip has probably resulted in no change for anyone, except for me. I do feel guilt for the crime. It was a crime,' he said.

'I wasted a lot of time of the North Koreans and the Americans, of all of the officials who spent time with my case.'
