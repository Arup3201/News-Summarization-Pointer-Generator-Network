A new diet app will allow users to connect with a nutrition expert at the click of a button.

Boston-based NuPlanit, which is expected to launch in spring 2015, rejects traditional calorie-counting, and instead gives  users a nutrition score when they log each meal.

The idea is that users are more likely to successfully lose weight and improve overall health with a  scoring system  based on customized food group goals than by watching calorie intake.

Health savvy: Instead of calorie counting, the app uses a customized Nutrition Score that highlights food groups

Founder and CEO Alaina Adams says she wants to shift the conversation from what you are eating to address the psychological reason why your food habits are they way they are.

Ms Adams, who also has a PhD in mechanical engineering, was inspired to create NuPlanit in 2013 after her own struggles with a nutrition-related illness.

'I knew what I needed to do,' she told BostInno. 'I had a great care team, I was motivated, yet my stressful, busy life kept me going back to my old, comfortable, destructive habits.

'I found that I was more successful when I had regular check-ins with my dietitian, however I needed more support during my everyday life.'

Ms Adams says in a company press release that simple dieting and calorie counting approaches fail 95 per cent of the time and current solutions for weight loss and management don't incorporate a nutrition expert even though research shows they they are proven to be an asset when trying to alter bad food habits.  

That's not all: The app provides users with food tracking logs, customized feedback, quality of life monitoring, automatic physical activity tracking and a 'smart' grocery shopping adviser with personalized meal planning, recipes and coupons.

'Each person has unique nutrient needs for optimal health so we developed a nutrition scoring algorithm, personalized to each individual's daily needs,' she explains.

'We then use behavior change methodologies to deliver targeted feedback, recommendations and support to help people improve their Nutrition Score, their quality of life and ultimately their physical health.' 

After logging in their meals, users are given automatic feedback and reminders on how to improve their Nutrition Score, which is rated from 0-100 throughout the day.

NuPlanit will be free for users to download, but features including video counseling sessions with an expert will require a monthly subscription, though fees are yet to be announced. 

If users are struggling between options or tempted to binge, they can click a 'Nutrition Lifeline' button, which puts customers in touch with either their current dietitian or one of the network's experts (chosen based on location, health insurance carrier and needs).

While you aren't required to seek the advice of an expert, NuPlanit encourages customers to utilize human interaction as a way to identify and eradicate negative eating patterns. 

According the NuPlanit website, the average person makes more than 200 food-related decisions a day, which can make healthy eating seem overwhelming at times.  

NuPlanit also offers text and video counseling, quality of life monitoring, automatic physical activity tracking and a 'smart' grocery shopping adviser with personalized meal planning, recipes and coupons.

The startup, which is currently in beta, launched a crowdfunding campaign in late November on Indiegogo with a goal of raising $50,000 by January 13 in order to enhance the product and grow its network of nutrition experts.
