Outside court: Sharne Tucker, 23, beat his 72-year-old grandmother up to 50 times with the walking stick iwhile she cooked breakfast

A man who brutally attacked his blind grandmother with her own walking stick while high on LSD has walked free from court - after she refused to give evidence against him.

Sharne Tucker, 23, beat 72-year-old Jean Wheeler up to 50 times with the stick in the home they shared in Ferndown, Dorset, while she cooked breakfast.

When police arrived after a frantic 999 call from the battered pensioner they found blood and broken furniture at the scene.

The night before the vicious attack drug-crazed Tucker had taken two LSD tablets to celebrate his 23rd birthday.

And when morning came he turned on his grandmother, yelling: 'I’ll kill you, you’re wicked.'

Mrs Wheeler suffered cuts and bruises to her face and body in the horrifying attack but didn’t want Tucker to be prosecuted and refused to give evidence against him.

A judge spared Tucker prison and let him off with a suspended jail sentence and 200 hours community service order.

Campaign groups for blind people have slammed the sentence as too lenient.

Jonathan Holyhead, chief executive of the Dorset Blind Association, said: 'I’m shocked and horrified at what appears to be a lenient sentence for a crime of this kind.

'It is frightening for anyone to be attacked but if you have sight loss you are even more vulnerable.

'Blind people have to put their trust and confidence in their immediate family.

'It is incredibly sad when someone abuses that trust.'

Bournemouth Crown Court heard Tucker had been celebrating his 23rd birthday and took two LSD tablets the night before the attack on July 29 this year.

Jennie Rickman, prosecuting, said: 'His grandmother was cooking breakfast when she heard shouting and vile language.

'He began to hit her with a stick 40 to 50 times saying ‘I’ll kill you, you’re wicked.’

'He knocked her to the ground and she managed to get to the door, falling out on to the step. She managed to phone the police at 5.44am.'

During the 999 call, the terrified pensioner said: 'He’s gone absolutely mental, he’s normally a gentle person.

'I woke up this morning with him screaming, punching me and hitting me with a stick.

'He’s normally a wonderful person, I’ve got a big bump on my head; a tooth has been knocked out.

'This is so unexpected; not normal behaviour - he is really out of his mind, calling me a murderer.'

Tucker told police he couldn’t remember the attack but pleaded guilty to assault, causing actual bodily harm.

James Newton-Price, defending, said: 'It is out of character and inexplicable. He had a very close relationship with his grandmother and had lived with her for eight years.

'She referred to him as her son.'

Judge Samuel Wiggs, who imposed a nine-month prison sentence suspended for two years, said: 'I see no public interest in sending you to jail.'

Tucker was also ordered to pay £250 court costs.
