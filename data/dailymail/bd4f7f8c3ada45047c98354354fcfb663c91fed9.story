It's the sort of welcome England might have hoped for had they performed anywhere near as valiantly as their Group D rivals at the World Cup, Costa Rica.

Instead, the tiny Central American country, which has a population of just 4.5 million, were lauded as returning heroes on their arrival back home after a remarkable World Cup campaign.

Widely tipped to finish bottom of a group comprising three previous World Cup winners, Costa Rica emerged as one of the stories of a truly remarkable tournament as they picked up seven points to send England and Italy packing.

A round of 16 win over Greece on penalties ensured Costa Rica of their best ever World Cup finish as they reached the last eight for the first time, where only a shootout defeat by the Dutch prevented them from reaching the semi-final stage.

Still, the mood of celebration in the capital of San Jose could not be dampened by Costa Rica's exit as their stars touched down to find thousands waiting to celebrate.

And celebrate they did.
