There is nothing like a glass of wine after a long day, but some Brits hold off on this pleasure longer than others

It is a moment many of us look forward to – but it seems that some of us wait longer than others to pour our first evening drink.

For while the average Brit uncorks the wine or takes the top off the gin bottle at 7.36pm, a new survey has revealed something of a North-South divide when it comes to savouring the first alcoholic drink of the day, with the residents of Brighton proving the most thirsty.

They open the door of the drinks cabinet at 5pm, some three hours behind the surprisingly restrained Scots who wait, on average, until 8pm. 

The Welsh, meanwhile, mark the end of the working day with a drink at 6.30pm, while the citizens of London, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle kick back at 7pm, followed by Oxford, Cambridge and Leeds at 7.30 pm. 

The findings, from a survey of three thousand adults aged between 18 and 60 taken last month by market research company OnePoll, form part of the first nationwide report into the nation’s drinking habits commissioned by drinks website Thebar.com.

It found that the UK’s drinking habits have changed in the last decade, with an increased preference for sour-flavoured drinks. Vodka, however, remains the UK’s bestselling spirit, followed closely by gin, which has enjoyed a fifteen percent increase in sales in the last decade.

That, however, is nothing compared to the renaissance of rum, whose sales have increased by 23 percent in the last ten years as the nation embraces the art of making cocktails at home. When they’re out, though, the nation’s barmen report a growing preference for sour-flavoured cocktails and more traditional mixed drinks over the last decade, with the whisky-based Old Fashioned and citrus flavoured Gin Fizz making a comeback.  

Our tastebuds seem to be changing when it comes to beer too, with sales of Belgian Sour up 31 per cent last year alone, making it the second-fastest growing style of beer.

Some things remain reasonably constant however: with the festive season just around the corner, the report found that Baileys remains the top Christmas drink – with the traditionally whiskey-drinking Scots proving to be the top consumers.

They stock 16 per cent of the country’s Baileys in their drinks cupboard.

A spokesperson for Thebar.com said. 'It is really interesting to see how different the nations drinking habits are and how our drink preference are changing. It seems the further north you go the later the average drink is poured.

'But what really stood out from our findings is that wherever we live we’re all becoming more savvy when it comes to food, cocktails and mixed drinks, with a better understanding or and passion for flavours. ’
