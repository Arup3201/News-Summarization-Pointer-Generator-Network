While many people blame their cellulite on poor diet and lack of exercise, one psychologist thinks it may be to do with repressed anger from childhood

Dreading getting into your bikini this summer because of your lumpy legs? You're not alone. Eighty per cent of women suffer from cellulite - including svelte stars such as Kim Kardashian and Sienna Miller.

A host of products and wacky gimmicks - from
 detox diets and green tea patches to miracle cellulite melting knickers - are out there which claim to tackle orange peel thighs.

But, according to Venezuelan psychologist Martha Sanchez Navarro, it's time to cast aside the magic pants, banish the body brush and book into therapy instead.

She believes the condition - which occurs when the strands that connect the
layers of tissue and the fat below the skin gradually harden and 
contract - is caused by childhood trauma, not insufficient exercise or poor circulation.

She says our emotions find an outlet through physical symptoms and
 any childhood stress - such as having too many rules to obey - 
suppresses creativity and can cause cellulite later in life.

It may all sound rather unlikely, but
 Sanchez Navarro isn't the only one who believes our emotions can leave 
such a visible mark on us.

Natural beauty expert, Alexander 
Barani, agrees: 'Our emotional lives certainly play a part in the 
physical effects of our bodies.

'The repression of feelings can also 
lead to more wrinkles! I encourage all to be more open with your 
feelings to prevent these physical symptoms appearing.

So, if we are to believe Sanchez Navarro
 and Barani, it's time to abandon that British reserve, let it all hang 
out and not only will your thighs be smoother, but your face too.

While there are plenty of lotions and potions out there to help you beat dimpled skin, they could be a waste of money

Sanchez Navarro isn't the only one with ideas about the origins of cellulite - as the exact causes are not yet fully understood, theories abound.

It's commonly thought diet plays a major part: too much fat, salt, carbohydrates and not enough fibre may make you more likely to suffer from fatty lumps and bumps.

Some believe hormones may be to blame, as estrogen, insulin, noradrenaline, thyroid hormones and prolactin are part of the cellulite production process. Others say our it's all down to our genes.

Two of the main causes of cellulite are believed to be lack of activity and a poor diet containing too much sugar, fat and salt

However, not everyone agrees with the Sanchez Navarro's findings.

Dr Wolf, Joint Medical Director at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'There are a number of factors which can contribute to the development of cellulite.

 'Until more research is carried out, 
women should continue to focus on healthy diet, weight maintenance and 
regular exercise regime, and try not to fluctuate any of these factors 
too much and keep them consistent'

'These do include weight gain and obesity but that is not to say that all women who are overweight will suffer with cellulite.

'The broad categories of causes are: hormonal, genetic, environmental and lifestyle. Some of these we can obviously change, but others not.

'Poor nutrition or crash dieting can contribute to cellulite on the thighs, buttocks and even the stomach. Smoking has also been found to contribute, while not drinking enough water or maintaining a diet that is too high in salt can also lead to its formation.

'But while stress (particularly when coupled with an irregular, unhealthy diet and  lack of exercise) can be a genuine cause of cellulite, there has not been enough research to support the notion that low levels of creativity, or any kind of emotional strain, can be to blame.

'And until more research is carried out, women should continue to focus on healthy diet, weight maintenance and regular exercise regime, and try not to fluctuate any of these factors too much and keep them consistent.'

Germaine de Capuccini Fit Body Patches have a combination of bladderwrack algae, caffeine, green tea, ivy and horse chesnut extracts which apparently work together to help drain toxins while you sleep

The £50 BioElixia cream has a 'delivery system' which claims to penetrate active ingredients deeper into the skin than rival creams

The £43 Cinq Mondes Slimming Coffee Cream contains coffee beans - caffeine is said to help banish cellulite
