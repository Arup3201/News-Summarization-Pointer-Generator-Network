She has admitted, much to her irritation, that she is better known for ‘getting her kit off’ than her award-winning performances on screen and stage.

But it seems Dame Helen Mirren just can’t help herself.

Nigel Cole, director of the film Calendar Girls in which the actress had a starring role, revealed he had to force her to put her robe back on after shooting her scene because she revelled in strutting around in her birthday suit.

Dame Helen, who stripped for the calendar, admitted in the past:  ‘I’m famous for getting my kit off in England.'

Cole said: ‘The actors were very supportive of each other: a bottle of champagne would be waiting whenever anyone finished their nude scene. 

'They were all women in their 50s and 60s and were thrilled by roles that recognised their sensuality. 

'After one nude shoot, I recall having to tell Helen Mirren to put her robe back on three or four times.’

The 2003 film, based on the true story of Yorkshire Women’s Institute members who disrobe for a charity calendar, was a box office hit and earned Dame Helen, now 69, a Golden Globe nomination.

Performing alongside Dame Helen in the film was Celia Imrie, 62, who has admitted, unlike the Oscar-winning Queen star, she struggled with stripping off but Dame Helen led the way.

‘I can’t bear taking my clothes off. I have never been a pretty young thing and stripping off is far more daring when you don’t have a figure to die for. 

'But I love a challenge and there was never any question of us wearing flesh-coloured coverings. That would have been a cheat.

'The real-life calendar girls taught all of us in the cast not to take ourselves too seriously - and Helen, who was used to disrobing for the camera, led us on.

Celia Imrie said: ‘I can’t bear taking my clothes off.'

‘I was the first. I had first-night-style nerves beforehand but, given that my character was supposed to be nervous, the anxiety actually helped. 

'And the rest of the cast made a big fuss of me afterwards in my dressing room, where they’d set out champagne and Twiglets.’

Littered with scenes of tasteful nudity, Cole confesses he struggled to know where to look during filming: ‘However strategically we placed vegetables, bits kept showing through and we’d have to reshoot.

'Even after we’d cut the film, there were things popping out that shouldn’t have been - and a young man from digital remastering had to spend four weeks removing the private parts. Although the nude scenes only took a week, it felt like a year. 

'The more you know you shouldn’t look, the more you want to, and I noticed the film crew keeping very busy, working far harder than they normally do because they didn’t want to be caught gazing.

'It was a challenge as a director having to confront veteran actors who were completely naked. I’ve never made so much eye contact in my life. I’d offered to strip, so we were all in it together. 

'That might have made it easier for me, but the offer was declined.’

In Cole’s opinion, the film broke the mould for middle-aged actresses – but it did not go down well with many male actors at the time. 

In his interview with the Guardian, he said: ‘It was rare for a film to focus on middle-aged women and not just show them as mothers or aunties.

'But this made it harder to cast the male parts: several actors disliked the idea of being subsidiary to women. 

'Also, it was the era of Billy Elliot and The Full Monty, and I was keen to make a film about northern England that was not about poverty and deprivation. 

'I remember waiting at Skipton station to be collected by Helen Mirren’s real-life counterpart. Every time a battered old Ford came along, I thought that must be her. 

'Then a black BMW roared up blaring rock music and there she was at the wheel. It brought home to me how guilty we all are of stereotyping.’

When interviewed several years ago about her penchant for nudity, Dame Helen, who is married to director Taylor Hackford, said: ‘I’m famous for getting my kit off in England. It did used to get to me but I just kind of ignore it…I’m still doing it! [stripping off]’

Dame Helen has appeared naked in at least nine films during her illustrious career: 1969’s Age of Consent, 1972’s Savage Messiah, then O Lucky Man!, Calligula, Hussy, Excalbur, the Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, Calendar Girls and Love Ranch.
