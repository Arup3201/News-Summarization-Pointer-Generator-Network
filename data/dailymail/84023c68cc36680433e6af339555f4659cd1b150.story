TV presenter Clare Balding has revealed she was spooked after spotting a mysterious panther-like beast in the English countryside as she conducted a radio interview.

The journalist and sports pundit was at The Doward, a beauty spot near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire when she spotted what appeared to be a large black cat sitting in a country lane.

She saw the 'enormous' creature while being shown around by locals as she recorded her BBC Radio 4 show Ramblings.

There have been numerous sightings of big cat-like creatures across the country since the 90s - but there has been little concrete evidence to prove their existence.

The former jockey said on the programme: 
'Gosh. We've walked out on to the road and turned left and sitting in 
the middle of the road ahead of us, honestly, I thought it was a 
panther.

'It was the most enormous black cat. I mean really big, like a dog size.'

Roger Smith, who was giving her guided tour of the picturesque locale, told her he too had seen it twice in the same location over the past few years.

Ms Balding asked him if it was indeed a big cat and Mr Smith replied: 'Who knows? Nobody has ever actually got a photograph of it.

'I've seen black cats the size of our Rottweiler and our friends have seen big black cats feeding on deer carcass.

'There's always been stories of a big black cat on the Doward ever since we moved here 20 years ago, and a number of our friends have seen it.'

Ms Balding 
continued: 'I saw it, I saw it really clearly. It's just gone off slowly
 to the left. It just sloped, it didn't scuttle, it just very 
confidently walked across the road and disappeared into the woods.

'I should point out, I never knew the stories of a big black cat. I'm all excited now, adrenaline's flowing.'

Over the years there have been a number of sightings of big cats in the British countryside.

Although the animals are sometimes pictured, and carcasses with wounds similar to those inflicted in an attack by such a predator have been found, their existence has never been conclusively proved.

In November, scientists announced they may have found evidence to show that big cats really are roaming the British countryside, by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their 'victims'.

Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets

Expert Dr Andrew Hemmings believes he found proof that big cats have been stalking Gloucestershire and neighbouring counties by analysing the remains of wild animals, which appear to have been eaten by beasts larger than any known British carnivores.

Dr Hemmings, a senior lecturer in animal science at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons which all bore unusual teethmarks.

Some of the livestock and deer remains, found by farmers, landowners and volunteers, had been found in unusual circumstances which suggested that they may have been killed by a big cat.

From the Beast of Trowbridge, to the Wildcat of Woodchester, big cat sightings have sparked the imaginations of many people over the years, although bar a few fuzzy photographs there has been little to prove their existence.

Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the Dangerous Wild Animals act.

The Beast of Trowbridge, which has been seen around the Wiltshire town, is described as a puma or panther. The animal has also been seen in nearby Staverton and Westbury Leigh.

In 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to Bodmin Moor

And last month a couple claim they spotted a black panther on the loose in an Essex field, describing it as a ‘big scary cat’.

Lynn Lacy and husband Michael were at home when they allegedly spotted the beast, which they claim was ‘jet black’ and ‘too big’ to be a dog or cat.

Mrs Lacy, 56, took this photo of the unknown animal on her iPhone after she spotted it on the edge of Hatfield Forest.

In August 2012 a blurry picture of what resembles a big cat prowling around a patch of countryside near Nailsworth in Gloucestershire emerged.

The furry black figure was caught on a trip camera sprinting through woodland after apparently being spooked by a walker.

One of the more famous big cats is 
the Beast of Bodmin Moor - over 60 sightings of a large black cat have 
occurred in the area over the years.

In 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor.

The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification.

They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain.

In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug.

The
 Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  conducted an official 
investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be 
roaming Britain in 1995.

It concluded there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain,.

But it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were 'not present'.
