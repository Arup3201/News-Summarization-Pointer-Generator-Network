When Naomi Broady walks  out at Wimbledon tomorrow as one of three home-grown female wildcards, she will carry the unwanted and, she says, unmerited reputation of being the wild child of British tennis.

The former under-18 UK  girls’ champion remains fiercely unrepentant about what she claims was an innocent girls’ night out seven years ago that almost ruined her career  and triggered a devastating family row.

The scandal was caused when she posted a photo of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively in a minidress next to a condom machine in a toilet.

It caught the attention of the press and sparked the wrath of the Lawn Tennis Association, which promptly stripped her of her funding, throwing the future of her career in jeopardy.

Similar action was taken against another player, David Rice, who shared a picture of himself surrounded by pizza boxes.

Miss Broady says the scandal has made her tennis career a struggle ever since. Unlike her rivals, she has no coach and travels alone to tournaments.

Speaking for the first time about the incident, Miss Broady, now 24, said: ‘I don’t know why it was such a big deal. I wasn’t drunk and I wasn’t doing drugs either. I was trying to live, for a few nights at least, as a normal 17-year-old. It was blown out of all proportion.

‘I was disgusted with how the LTA handled things. They warned me the picture would be appearing in the next day’s newspapers, but I heard nothing after that.

Frustration: The former junior champion chose to boycott LTA funding over their dealing of the situation

‘We were given no press training and no support. David and I were thrown to the lions while they protected their reputation. We were used as an example but we were just children.

‘It didn’t happen during a tournament and it wasn’t in a training block. Tell me any 17-year-old who doesn’t have a beer once in a  while? If it had been affecting my tennis, then fair enough, but it wasn’t. Now I’m tarnished with this bad girl reputation.’

Miss Broady’s father Simon, a property developer, was so appalled by the LTA’s decision that he pulled Naomi’s equally promising younger brother  Liam, then 13, out of the LTA programme. He then sold the family home to fund their  careers himself.

When the LTA offered Miss Broady funding again the following year, it was turned down on principle.

The family continued its boycott until last year when Liam, now on the men’s circuit, decided to accept LTA funding again – a move that has angered his father to the point where they are no longer on speaking terms.

Miss Broady said: ‘It’s a very touchy subject. Dad says he was trying to protect us, but now Liam is older and has to pay for tennis himself. It’s a difficult family issue. I try to stay out of it.’

But she insists she will not follow her brother’s example. ‘I don’t want their money and now  I have the prize money from Wimbledon I don’t need it,’ she said. ‘I won’t be bought by them after everything that’s happened.

‘I still to this day don’t understand what we did wrong.  If I want to have a night out then I will. If it’s going to affect my tennis, then I won’t do it because tennis is my priority.

‘The LTA certainly weren’t trying to protect me. The LTA only wanted what was best for them.’

A spokesman for the LTA said: ‘We have moved on and are glad that Naomi is doing well on court. We wish her the very best.’
