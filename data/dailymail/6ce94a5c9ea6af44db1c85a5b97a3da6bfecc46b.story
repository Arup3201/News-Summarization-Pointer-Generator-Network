The FBI has publicly admitted that they had radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in custody when he returned to America in 2002 but let him go.

An American-born al Qaeda cleric, second only to Osama bin Laden on the world's most-wanted list, al-Awlaki was eventually killed in Yemen last September during a US drone strike.

Despite being named a major threat by the head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service and the first American to become one of the CIA’s top targets, the FBI released him from custody after detaining him at JFK Airport in October 2002.

CIA top target: Radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was in US custody in 2002 but was allowed to walk free but the FBI have offered no explanation why

al-Awlaki, who had lived in London and thought to be behind several al Qaeda terrorist plots, had become the public face of the Islamic terrorist organisation in the wake of bin Laden's death.

Former FBI agents said there are two 
possible explanations for al-Awlaki’s abrupt release in 2002. That the FBI 
wanted to track him for intelligence or that the bureau wanted to work 
with him as a contact.

The 
‘global terrorist’ was detained at JFK Airport in New York City after 
the customs database identified an outstanding arrest warrant.

Detained but let go: The 'global terrorist' al-Awlaki was detained at JFK Airport in New York in 2002

Mark
Giuliano, the FBI’s assistant director for national security told an 
enquiry yesterday that there had been conversations between an FBI agent
and the US attorney in Colorado about al-Awlaki’s re-entry into the 
country and the warrant.

He said: ‘Yes, sir, there was a dialogue, as there always will be.

‘If
a case agent has a case on somebody that is coming into the country, 
the system is triggered and set up so that there will be a call to that 
case agent.’

But Mr Giulano
could not explain how the FBI knew of the terrorist’s return to America
nor the reasons why he was allowed to walk free from custody.

At a hearing yesterday into the Webster report into the bureau’s intelligence failures leading up to the Fort Hood massacre, in which Major Nidal Hasan was accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in Texas, links were made between Hasan and Al-Awlaki.

In an exchange of 19 emails Hasan told al-Awlaki 
that he advocated using suicide bombers and that he believed it was OK 
to kill civilians to which al-Awlaki replied that Hasan should keep his 
contact details handy.

Republican
Rep Frank Wolf, chairman of the committee that oversees the FBI said at
a hearing: ‘I really want to get to the bottom (of this)’ according to Fox News.

‘We’re
going to send a letter on this. If we can, we’re going to get a 
hearing, and if we have to, we may even subpoena the thing.’

al-Awlaki was being held when FBI agent Wade Ammerman told customs agents that ‘the warrant…had been pulled back’ but documents show that the warrant was still active at that time and was only relinquished later that day.

The bureau has always maintained that 
the case against al-Awlaki was weak and the pulling back of his arrest 
warrant was coincidental with the day he returned to America.

9/11: al-Awlaki was linked to the some of the September 11 hijackers and became the public face of al Qaeda in the wake of bin Laden's death

Why he was able to walk free when scores of Muslim men were held in detention centres on material witness warrants in the wake of September 11 attacks has never been explained by the FBI.

The terrorist has also been linked to September 11 hijackers, and was widely believed to be the mastermind behind a number of terror atrocities, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and inspired attacks by Muslims inside the United States including the Fort Hood massacre.

Mr Giuliano said: ‘If a prosecutor at that time, regardless of whether a call was made or not, looks at the evidence and decided there was not enough to be able to arrest that individual, the warrant would be dropped.

‘I assure you ... if we could have incarcerated al-Awlaki, we would have.’

But past and present investigators have said that once a warrant is signed off by a federal judge, it is not routine to review it.

They have also questioned why an exemption was made for a person who under an FBI investigation because of his links to September 11 hijackers.

Mr Giuliano said the FBI will make a decision within 60 to 90 days, based on the findings of the report by former FBI and CIA director William Webster.
