Liz Eswein, 24, has possibly one of the best jobs in the world: She gets paid 'to Instragram'.

The New York native owns the handle @NewYorkCity, which she created a few years ago because she was not sure she wanted to put her full name as her profile name, according to Business Insider.

Eswein, who calls herself a 'New Yorker obsessed with New York' on Instagram, started taking 
everyday photos around the city and posting them to the social 
photography platform mobile app.

Now, she has 960,691 followers and is one of the most followed, non-celebrity, people using Instagram.

Since then, Eswein and two other Instagrammers in New York, Brian DiFeo and Anthony Danielle, started their own company, Mobile Media Lab, which brands can hire to help them create Instagram campaigns.

So, if there is a big event in town, Eswein is there.

New Yorker Liz Estein has almost one million followers on Instagram. Here she is at Grand Central Station
