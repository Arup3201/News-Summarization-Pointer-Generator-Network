It is an assignment few will envy - taking on the one of the strongest teams in Europe and the favourites to win this season's Champions League.

And if Shakhtar Donetsk are to have any hope of beating Bayern Munich in their last 16 tie, they will need their star man Luiz Adriano firing.

The Brazilian hotshot was the top scorer in the competition after the group phase, scoring nine times, including five in Shakhtar's 7-0 thrashing of BATE Borisov.

His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Lionel Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.

He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament.

But taking on the German champions is an entirely different proposition and current circumstances aren't exactly ideal for the reigning Ukrainian champions.

They are currently living a nomadic existence, with their Donbass Arena abandoned amid the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists.

As if to illustrate the volatility of the situation in eastern Ukraine, the Arena was shelled back in October, causing damage to the giant glass panels that form its facade.

So the first leg tie will be played some 750 miles (1,200km) to the east in Lviv, meaning Shakhtar miss out on many of the home advantages so crucial in the Champions League.

But one constant amid the upheaval has been Luiz Adriano's goals - he has 14 in just 20 matches across all competitions so far this season.

And he is out of contract in the summer. With the upheaval at Shakhtar unlikely to be resolved in the near-future, Adriano hasn't committed to a new deal and this has alerted a host of Europe's leading clubs as he would be available for nothing.

He hails from Porto Alegre, grew up idolising Romario and Ronaldo and started his career at hometown club Internacional, for whom he made 12 league appearances and scored three goals during the 2006-2007 campaign.

But before he reached that stage, he had to choose between football and his other great talent - music. He played in a rock band back home and never misses an opportunity to show off his singing skills.  

The highlight of his short career at the club came against European champions Barcelona in the final of the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.

Having scored the winner against Al-Ahly in the semi-finals, the striker came on as a late substitute in the final and assisted Adriano Gabiru in scoring the winner.

Around this time, he was involved in the Brazil Under 20 squad, making 11 appearances and scoring twice, but he didn't make the step-up to the Selecao's first team until last year.

In March 2007, Luiz Adriano followed in the footsteps of many other Brazilian players by moving to the Ukrainian league with Shakhtar for a fee of about £2.5m.

His first full season with Shakhtar resulted in Ukrainian league glory and in 2009, he scored the team's first goal in their UEFA Cup final win over Werder Bremen.

By 2009-2010 he was fully settled in Donetsk and his goalscoring ratios steadily climbed - in 2009-10 he scored 17 goals in 36 games and the following year got 20 in 37.

His goals helped Shakhtar to an outstanding period of success as they won the title five seasons in a row and became a dangerous opponent to face in Europe.

In February 2011, he scored the decisive goal in their 3-2 away win over Roma in the first leg of a last 16 tie. 

His involvement in Europe has sometimes been controversial. He received a one-match suspension for unsporting behaviour after pouncing on a Willian backpass to the Nordsjaelland goalkeeper following an injury and going on to score. Shakhtar backed UEFA's sanctions and said they were deeply disappointed by Adriano's actions.

Across all competitions, he has 122 goals in 253 appearances for the club and his fourth goal against BATE meant he overtook Andriy Vorobey to become their all-time leading goalscorer.

Adriano had understandably hoped to receive a call-up to the Brazil squad for last summer's World Cup finals on home territory but Luiz Felipe Scolari overlooked him. However, in October, Dunga called him up for the friendlies against Turkey and Austria, and he made his debut in the former.
