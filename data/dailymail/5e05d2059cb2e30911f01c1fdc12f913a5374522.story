Liverpool are continuing to discuss the possibility of new additions to their squad should Brendan Rodgers get money to spend.

A goalkeeper and striker remain the objectives but key could be the departure of £10million-rated Fabio Borini.

Sunderland remain interested but the Italian is not keen to join and Inter Milan have yet to firm up tentative interest. Borini is clearly surplus to requirements but wanted to fight for his place with Liverpool short on in-form and fit strikers. The Reds would also likely have to pay Borini to leave and that is not something they are overly keen to do.

Chelsea's Petr Cech and Jack Butland of Stoke are names in the frame for the goalkeeping position but these deals are not straightforward for January. 

Swansea's Wilfried Bony remains a player Rodgers likes but his cost will see any deal likely shelved until the summer and the loan market may be Liverpool's best route.

Lille confirmed that Liverpool have yet to make any call on bringing in Divock Origi ahead of schedule but, when asked, Lille director Jean-Michel Vandamme said: 'Origi to Liverpool? We haven't received any proposal, but they could offer £5.5m in January.'

Meetings will continue this week over potential targets.

Lassana Diarra is unlikely to join QPR despite being a free agent.

Manager Harry Redknapp, who remains keen on Tottenham's Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend plus Manchester City's Scott Sinclair, wanted to sign the former France midfielder Diarra in the summer after his fall-out with Lokomotiv Moscow. However, after delays in his release paperwork from Lokomotiv, Redknapp moved for Sandro at Tottenham instead.

Diarra, 29, has been training with West Ham's head of medicine and sports science Stijn Vandenbroucke to maintain his fitness and, if anything, would prefer to join up with his former colleague at Upton Park.

Diarra worked with Vandenbroucke at Anzhi Makhachkala and has always held the Belgian in high regard. Diarra though also has offers to return to Russia while there are clubs in China and Spain also showing an interest.

QPR, who have opened talks about a new contract for striker Charlie Austin, will likely have to deal in loans or free transfers, even more rare at this time of year, as they remain fearful of what punishment they will be given over breach of Financial Fair play guidelines.

Rangers are expected to face a substantial fine because in 2012-13, which resulted in relegation to the Championship, the club lost £65m despite earning Premier League income of £61m. QPR paid their staff, including players, £78m in the year to May 31, 2013.

If, in their promotion season QPR did not cut their wage bill enough to compensate for the loss of Premier League income and made a loss as high as the previous year, they could face a fine of £54m. The rules impose a fine of approximately £7m for a loss to £18m, then pound for pound above that.

The club will be told of their punishment before January 1.

West Brom are watching Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong and Crystal Palace's Sullay Kaikai.

Everton, Celtic, Hull and Sporting Lisbon have also watched Armstrong, 22, and Albion sent along scout Stuart Millar to watch the Scotland man against Aberdeen last week.

Crystal Palace winger Kaikai, 19, has been on loan at Cambridge United in League Two and has Wilfred Zaha and Yannick Bolasie ahead of him in Palace's first-team squad.

Wolfsburg will demand £25m for Manchester City target Kevin de Bruyne.

The Belgium midfielder only joined the Bundesliga side from Chelsea for last summer in a deal worth £18m.

City are scouting alternatives should James Milner fail to agree terms on his contract and de Bruyne is a player with limited Premier League experience but one who can play a number of roles.

The 23-year-old can play left or right wing and behind the striker and has scored six goals this season. He left Stamford Bridge as he wanted to play regular football and that would be another consideration should City follow up their interest.

City will evaluate the returns of Stevan Jovetic, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero before considering moves in January. Although they have no immediate plans to buy they will see what deals arise. Jovetic is expected to be back this week with Dzeko around the second week in January from his calf injury.

City are wary of such injuries arising again and threatening their title challenge but any new player will not be allowed to play in the Champions League anyway due to restrictions placed on City's squad by UEFA this season.

Premier League scouts are watching Doncaster striker Jack McKay. Representatives from clubs across the country were out in force last week to watch FA Youth Cup holders Norwich at Doncaster, many waiting to see Norwich's latest prospects but it was 18-year-old McKay who stole the spotlight with a hat-trick as Doncaster ran out 3-1 winners. 

Everton, Leicester and Crystal Palace were already following McKay, whose twin brother Paul plays at centre-back. Jack, who is 6ft 3in tall, converted a first half penalty and struck twice in extra time after Michee Efete had headed home a last gasp equaliser for Norwich City.

New York Red Bulls' Tim Cahill is weighing up a return to England. Cahill, who was wanted by Sunderland and QPR last summer, believes he could continue playing for another four seasons, into his 40th year and said: 'I've got another year left on my New York Red Bulls contract. The main feeling for me is every time I'm at a club, I like to be there for a long time.

'To be totally honest, I could have gone back to the Premier League on loan after the World Cup and I decided to stay with Red Bulls for the remainder of the season and still (have) options to go back to the Premier League if it's the right one for me.

'So when you put everything into one, the decision I make will be a methodical one, like I've always made it. It will take a month or so but I think people will be quietly impressed with what I'm trying to do.'

Manchester United are watching Birmingham teenager Josh Martin.

The 15-year-old centre back was given a first-team squad number by former manager Lee Clark and has been widely tipped to break Trevor Francis's record of being the youngest player to represent the club.

Francis made his debut in 1970, aged 16 years and 139 days and Clark, now boss at Blackpool said: 'I think before the season finishes he will play in the first team and break Trevor Francis’ record. I think he's that good. At 15 years of age to be considered for first team football is an unbelievable achievement and tells you about the player.'

Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool have also watched Martin but United are hopeful they can beat them to the Bournville School pupil.

USA right back DeAndre Yedlin will join Tottenham Hotspur in January after securing a work permit on appeal.

Tottenham announced in August that Yedlin had agreed a four-year deal to move to White Hart Lane from MLS franchise the Seattle Sounders for a fee of £2.5m, but he could not secure permission from the Home Office for the switch.

Yedlin has won the right to work in the UK on appeal after being granted a Governing Body Endorsement. He will be officially unveiled on January 1.

Juventus believe they have beaten Liverpool and Everton to the signature of Martin Montoya.

The Barcelona full back is due to hold talks on Monday with the Italian giants and they are confident of agreeing a deal for the 23-year-old.

Montoya is out of contract in the summer and has told Barca he is leaving in January. Liverpool and Everton both showed interest but the Spaniard is ready to sign for Juve if they agree terms with his club over coming days.
