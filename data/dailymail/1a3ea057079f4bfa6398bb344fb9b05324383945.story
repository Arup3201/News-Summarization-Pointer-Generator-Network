These incredible portraits were created 
by an artist who fired bullets from a .22 calibre rifle through sheets 
of aluminium at point blank range.

Walton Creel began using the innovative technique to shoot images of various animals but has now decided to make portraits of people which he says requires more detail, and skill.

His work involves painting 4ft by 4ft sheets of 
aluminium white and taking them into the forest near his home, where he 
fires up to 3,500 bullets through them.

Skill: Walton Creel came up with his innovative style of art when he created
images of various animals with his gun shots - but now shoots portraits of people

Innovative: Mr Creel makes the pictures (right) by firing bullets from a .22 calibre rifle through sheets of aluminium at point blank range (left)

Talent: The artist's work - including this picture of a rabbit - requires a large amount of preparation and concentration

Imaginative: Mr Creel said he came up with the unusual style of art after growing up around guns in his native Alabama

The holes create an outline of the person and the surrounding paint peels off to form a dot-to-dot style picture.

He uses a smaller rifle in some areas of his work to add definition. Mr Creel originally fired his rifle at canvas but found the bullets were too destructive as they tore it to shreds.

However,
he now faces the danger of a richochet or bullet malfunction when 
standing immediately in front of the reinforced aluminium.

Owl: Mr Creel said he uses the gun 'less as a rifle and more as a power tool to systematically create points in my images'

The 38-year-old says his artwork 'deweaponises' the gun he received from his dad as a Christmas present aged 15.

The self-taught artist was inspired by the hunting and gun culture in his home town of Birmingham, Alabama, United States.

Creel said: 'I grew up in the south-eastern US where the culture is tied to guns and outdoor sports in general.

'I wanted to incorporate guns into my art for quite a while, but was never quite happy with any of my ideas.

'I use the gun less as a rifle and more as a power tool to systematically create points in my images.'

On average each portrait takes around 12 hours to complete, with preparation and design work adding extra time.

The artist plans to design and create a further eight portraits which will then feature at an exhibition once completed.

He
added: 'The main difference in the people and animals images is we can 
recognise individual humans whereas animals are more generic.

'With a specific person I have to make sure the image actually captures my subject's likeness.
I end up spending a lot of time on subtle details that may only consist
of three or four bullet holes to make sure everything is right.'

Wren: Look closely and you can see the hundreds of bullet holes needed to create this stunning image of a bird

Beauty: Mr Creel started off by firing at canvas, but found the bullets simply shredded the material so he turned to metal instead. Pictured are an image of a stag (left) and an Opossum (right)
