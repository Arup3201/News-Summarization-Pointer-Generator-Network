Jonathan Davies will make his first Wales start of the autumn series on Saturday after being declared fit to face New Zealand.

The Clermont Auvergne centre missed the opening Tests against Australia and Fiji with a shoulder injury but will return this weekend to take on the All Blacks.

Leigh Halfpenny, Dan Biggar and Rhys Webb also return to the back-line after being ruled out of Saturday’s narrow 17-13 victory over Fiji.

Davies has missed all of Wales' autumn series so far after sustaining a shoulder injury

George North keeps his place in the Wales starting XV after scoring the opening try in their win vs Fiji

Alex Cuthbert has also kept his place on the other wing for Wales after scoring also against Fiji

Wales XV: Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), George North (Northampton Saints), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Webb (Ospreys); Paul James (Bath), Richard Hibbard (Gloucester), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Dan Lydiate (Unattached), Sam Warburton (Cardiff Blues, CAPT), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons).

Replacements: Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Rhodri Jones (Scarlets), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), James Hook (Gloucester), Liam Williams (Scarlets).

‘It’s pretty much the same side that played against Australia and it’s a boost to have a few players back from injury,’ said head coach Warren Gatland.

‘It’s one of the most experienced teams we have put out. We are expecting another clinical performance from the All Blacks. We need to match their intensity and aggression.’

Liam Williams misses out on a place in the starting XV following his impressive performance against the South Sea Islanders and he is joined on the bench by utility back James Hook, who gets the nod ahead of misfiring Rhys Priestland.

Alex Cuthbert, George North and Jamie Roberts all keep their place in the starting XV, while there are five changes in the forwards.

No 8 Taulupe Faletau, flanker Dan Lydiate and prop Samson Lee have all been handed their third start of the series, while Paul James, Jake Ball, Alun Wyn Jones and Sam Warburton all return to the pack.

Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard - who has been caught in the crossfire of a club versus country row after ignoring advice from the Welsh medical team to play against Harlequins - also starts after holding clear-the-air talks with Gatland.

‘A couple of decisions have been forced upon us. Gethin Jenkins has a hamstring strain, Bradley Davies hasn’t trained for the first couple of days and Liam Williams had a bit of ankle knock at the weekend and it was a big call on him but he will start on the bench.

‘The players are obviously excited about the opportunity to face the number one side at a packed Millennium Stadium. We have named an experienced team and we are really looking forward to it.’ 

Taulupe Faletau will also start against New Zealand - making it his third of the autumn series at No 8
