Almost 160,000 patients a year suffer from sores, infections and injuries caused by neglectful NHS care, figures show.

The health problems are being picked up on hospital wards and in care homes.

The figure represents one in 12 – 8 per cent – of all those treated on the NHS,  but among the elderly it is nearer to one in ten.

Campaigners say it is ‘scandalous’ that hospitals are making patients even more unwell due to failings in basic care.

For the first time, the NHS has released data on the numbers of patients suffering any of four conditions linked to neglect.

They are falls, pressure sores, bladder infections and deep vein thrombosis – or blood clots – which can be avoided through good nursing care.

Between May 2012 and April 2013, a total of 159,946 patients suffered one of these.

Last month alone there were 15,000 cases including 13,100 pressure sores, 2,470 serious falls, 2,850 urinary infections and 1,139 blood clots. Some patients suffered more than one of the health problems.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘It is truly scandalous that patients are admitted to hospital for treatment for one condition, and then have to endure a second totally preventable issue.

‘This care deficit is leading to basic, but often serious and hugely painful, conditions. There is no excuse for poor care. Trusts have a duty to drive down the huge numbers of these terrible experiences and be accountable where they are falling short.’

Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said that in reality about one in ten patients come to harm once other hospital blunders are included. ‘It’s not a surprise to me but it’s disappointing,’ he added.

Hospital care and the standard of nursing has been in the spotlight since a damning report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly over a ten-year period

For the past 12 months NHS hospitals, care homes and community health services have submitted data on patients suffering falls, bed sores, blood clots or urinary infections. 

They were asked to record the percentage suffering one or more of these problems on a given day each month. Officials will use this data – the NHS Safety Thermometer – to monitor whether hospitals and other organisations are reducing the numbers of patients coming to harm.

Hospital care and particularly the standard of nursing has been in the spotlight since a damning report in February into the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the NHS trust over a ten-year period with some left crying in pain or forced to drink water from vases.

The report warned that similar pockets of neglect existed at other hospitals and the Government announced a number of changes to improve care.

They include compulsory placements for student nurses to prove they are capable of compassion and tougher inspections of hospitals and care homes.

Doctors have warned that seriously-ill patients are being shunted out of A&E and left on inappropriate wards where they are not properly looked after.

The Royal College of Physicians said a rise in admissions to hospital emergency units meant there was extra pressure on staff to move patients out quickly. 

For example, elderly people with pneumonia are being put on surgical wards – where many patients are young and otherwise fit – which tend to have fewer nurses.
