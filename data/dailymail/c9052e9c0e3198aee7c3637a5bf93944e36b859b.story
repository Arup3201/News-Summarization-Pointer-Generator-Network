John Terry avoided the transfer deadline madness on Monday as he enjoyed a day out with wife Toni and his children.

The Chelsea captain, who is currently in his 20th season at the club, was in no danger himself of moving on after just recently signing a new one-year deal at the club.

And with that in mind Terry took time away from the pitch to spend time with his family. 

Ready set: John Terry gets ready to flip into the foam pit at Guildford's Airhop

Dive in: Terry plunges head first in the foam pit as he prepares for his flip

Technique: Terry pulls of an impressive flip during the family outing

Strong: Terry looks in full swing as he aims for a smooth landing in the foam pit

Impressive: Terry's wife Toni also had a smooth landing from her flip

They visited Guildford's Airhop, one of the first Trampoline Parks in the UK, spending time on the giant open jump trampoline area and 3D dodge ball courts.

Terry and wife Toni were in good spirits as they were caught on camera doing flips into the foam pit.

The 33-year-old has been an ever-present for Chelsea this season as they sit top of the pile in the Premier League on goal difference after three straight wins.
