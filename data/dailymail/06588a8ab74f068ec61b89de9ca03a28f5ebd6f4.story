British workers should be forced to delay their retirements now or see £750billion added to the national debt, the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday.

It said the country faced financial ruin if the average lifespan in the UK rose by just three years more than predicted.

The organisation warned that if that happened, £750billion would be added 
to the national debt by 2050 to pay for the increased cost of pensions and healthcare.

Grey future: The IMF suggested a further increase in retirement ages, higher contributions into pension pots from employers and employees, and smaller payouts to those in old age

That would push the debt burden up from 76 per cent of national output to as much as 135 per cent.

In a report into so-called ‘longevity
risk’, the Washington-based IMF urged governments to tackle the problem
now before it is too late.

It
suggested a further increase in retirement ages, higher contributions 
into pension pots from employers and employees, and smaller payouts to 
those in old age.

The
report also said countries should consider linking the retirement age 
to life expectancy – an option being explored in Downing Street. ‘An 
essential reform is to allow retirement ages to increase along with 
expected longevity,’ the IMF report said.

‘This could be mandated by the government, but individuals could also be incentivised to delay retirement.’

The proposals raise the prospect of millions of Britons working into their seventies and even eighties.

The state pension age is already being increased to 67 for men and women by 2028, and to 68 by 2046.

Warning: The IMF said the national debt would spiral out of control if the average lifespan in the UK rose by just three years more than predicted

However, experts say linking the pension age to life expectancy would inevitably mean more rapid increases.

Nevertheless, Laura Kodres, an assistant director at the IMF, said such a plan would ‘keep the number of years in retirement constant’ and ease the strain on the public finances.

‘The longer you ignore it, the more difficult it becomes to resolve,’ she said. ‘The time to act is now.’

Demographers continue to expect the rise in life expectancy to slow down – but such a phenomenon has yet to occur in Britain.

After the Second World War, when the state pension age was 65 for men, their life expectancy was 66.4 years, while women’s was 72.5 years.

In 1977 the Government  was guided by actuaries who predicted that average life expectancy in 2011 would  be 71.

In fact, men today typically live to 77, while the figure is 82 for women. By 2056, the life expectancy for a man and woman living in England is expected to be 84 and 89 respectively.

The IMF said forecasts ‘have consistently underestimated how long people live’. 

Pension book: Over the years as people have began to live longer, the pressure on the country has increased

It claimed that predictions about longevity over the past 20 years had been too low by an average of about three years.

The IMF forecasts that the global cost of providing for an elderly population – based on replacing 60 per cent of pre-retirement income – will double over the coming  40 years.

In advanced countries such as ours, the annual cost will rise from 5 per cent of gross domestic product to 11 per cent.

‘If individuals live three years longer than expected – in line with underestimations in  the past – the already large cost of ageing could increase by another 50 per cent,’ the  IMF argued.

It said this would heighten the threat to government finances and could also damage ‘the solvency of private financial and corporate institutions exposed to longevity risk’.

The risks were greatest for institutions offering defined benefit pension plans and life annuities, it said.
