An Australian woman's French boyfriend who was gravely injured in the Charlie Hedbo shooting has woken up from the coma he was in for eight days.

Simon Fieschi, 31, was in an induced coma after a bullet punctured his lung and spine in the terror attack where two men massacred five of his colleagues in a hail of gunfire at the satirical newspaper's office in Paris.

Masie Dubosarky was visiting friends and family in Sydney for Christmas when the attack took place, and flew to be by her boyfriend's side on Friday as he underwent surgery for the gunshot wounds.

Ms Dubosarky's mother said that she had been by his bedside since she arrived back in the country.

'He is still in the intensive care unit. He has not been allowed visitors apart from family and Maisie,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

It is still unclear whether Mr Fieschi will walk again, and his girlfriend expressed both her relief at his lucky escape and fear for his future. 

She was left fearing for the worst until hearing news on Thursday morning he was alive but seriously injured, as bullet ricocheted off his spinal vertebra and perforated his lung. 

'Last night I was so happy because he wasn't dead. Now, realising that he might not walk again... it's kind of terrible. I just wish it wasn't real,' she told Fairfax Media. 

He will be allowed visitors as he continues to recover, including the survivors of the horrific attack on the satirical magazine.

Mr Fieschi, who had been responsible for fielding the large volume of hate mail the anti-Islamic magazine received, started working for the magazine just after the offices were firebombed in November 2011.

Ms Dubosarky, whose uncle is former Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, had emailed Mr Fieschi just ten minutes before the attack took place.

'I don't know when the shooting started but the last email I got from him was 10.39am Paris time,' she wrote on Facebook early Thursday morning.   

Ms Dubosarsky, who met her French boyfriend while on a working holiday in France 18 months ago,  said that the Charlie Hedbo staff did not consider the threats they received to be imminent.    

'They got threats all the time but … none of them thought that their lives were under threat. They were out in public all the time,' Ms Dubosarsky said.

She said she had met several of the people who worked at Charlie Hebdo and described them as passionate about free speech.

'They knew they were at the forefront of that. They were attacking everyone – in a sense they were so libertarian they almost had no politics. They went for everybody,' she said.  

Mr Fieschi's mother visited the offices of Charlie Hebdo this week as the publication worked to resurrect its irreverent and often provocative newspaper.

The cover, released yesterday, featured a caricature of the prophet Mohammed on the cover holding a sign which read 'Je Suis Charlie'.

The magazine, which normally sells around 30,000 copies a week, had an initial unprecedented print run of three million. This has been increased to five million after copies were snapped up today.

Issues of the magazine had sold out across Paris news kiosks within minutes, appearing on newsstands one week to the day after the assault in Paris by two masked gunmen. 

They stormed the newspaper office after forcing a female employee who had just arrived to work with her young daughter to open the door.   

The attackers headed straight for the paper's editor and cartoonist, Stephane Charbonnier, killing him and his police bodyguard.

The security had been recruited to protect him after extremists firebombed the offices in 2011 over a satirical cartoon about the Prophet Mohammed.

A year later, Mr Charbonnier famously dismissed threats against his life, declaring: 'I would rather die standing than live kneeling.' 

The gunmen said they were wreaking vengeance for the magazine's blasphemous cartoons and jokes about figures sacred to Islam.

One killer shouted 'Charlie Hebdo is dead!' following the massacre.

A top leader of Yemen's al Qaida branch has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'.

Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's al Qaida branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'. 

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks solidarity marches were organised in major cities around the country and the globe, with thousands waving banners reading Je suis Charlie - I am Charlie - in sympathy with the journalists that died. 

The journalists killed were (l to r) Charlie Hebdo's deputy chief editor Bernard Maris and cartoonists Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut, aka Cabu, Stephane Charbonnier, who is also editor-in-chief, and Bernard Verlhac
