West Ham have vowed to ban for life any supporters who ‘behaved in an inappropriate way’ after a video emerged online of a group of fans singing an anti-Semitic chant on the London Underground.

The club have urged anyone who witnessed discriminatory behaviour before or after the 2-2 draw with Tottenham to report it to the club, anti-discrimination group Kick It Out or the police.

It is understood the chanting started after a group of Hasidic Jews got on a train before the game.

This footage emerged on Twitter with a group of alleged West Ham fans chanting an anti-Semitic song 

A West Ham spokesman said: ‘If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way the club’s simple, zero-tolerance policy dictates they will face the strongest possible action, including the option of a life ban from the Boleyn Ground.’

Tottenham also called for tough action to be taken against anyone found guilty of discrimination.

A Spurs spokesman said: ‘Anti-Semitism in any form is wholly unacceptable and we support all efforts to kick it out of the game.

‘We hope those individuals responsible for this vile behaviour are identified and dealt with in the strongest way possible.’

Kick It Out indicated they received ‘several reports’ on Sunday about the video.

Chairman Lord Ouseley said: ‘What would have happened if we hadn’t seen this footage or it hadn’t been reported? We need to give people the confidence to challenge discriminatory and abusive behaviour, and this can only be reinforced by action being taken by police and within football by clubs and authorities.

‘Anti-Semitism must be tackled with the same vigour as all other forms of discrimination.’

In a further disturbing twist, a young female Tottenham fan told how she was abused in the street by a woman wearing a West Ham scarf — while police officers nearby did nothing.

Aspiring singer-songwriter Shivani Bedi was born and grew up in north London and has a Scottish mother and Indian father.

On Sunday, the 21-year-old told how she was approached as she stood in a queue waiting to use an ATM in Tottenham High Road after the match.

‘Out of nowhere this woman pushed me and started shouting. She told me to f*** off and called me a c***. She was wearing a West Ham scarf. She tried to hit me and a friend got in front of me.’ She said the attacker — who was in her 40s — gave the same friend a black eye and scratched her face.

‘The woman was finally dragged away by her kids. Then a man with her called me an Israeli c***.

‘There were police on duty within 20 metres of us and they didn’t do anything.’

Miss Bedi told how she had also suffered racial abuse at Arsenal and West Ham.

The incidents on Sunday come days after Chelsea fans were filmed pushing a black man off a train on the Paris Metro and singing a racist chant.
