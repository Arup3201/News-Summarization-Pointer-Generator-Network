Some 48 years, two months, 16 days and – if you look very closely at the clocks – just a few minutes separate these images of the two solemn events.

But, apart from a few radical additions to the City of London’s skyline, it is almost as if time has stood still.

You cannot help but be struck by the remarkable similarities between the two scenes.

A tale of two leaders: Crowds line Fleet Street as Sir Winston Churchill's coffin is led to St Paul's Cathedral on January 30, 1965. Yesterday, soldiers and public lined the same historic street to pay their respects to Baroness Thatcher as she was laid to rest

One shows the funeral cortege of Sir Winston Churchill on January 30, 1965. The other shows Baroness Thatcher’s funeral cortege yesterday.

Both events were photographed from the same position, looking down as the processions passed along Fleet Street on the way to St Paul’s.

On both occasions, crowds lined the streets in their masses to pay their last respects as the Union Jack-draped coffins passed by on gun carriages and the military featured heavily with similar pomp.

Sir Winston’s was a full state funeral, whereas Baroness Thatcher’s yesterday was a ceremonial occasion. But in practice there are few real differences between the two, except that a state funeral has to be approved by a vote in Parliament and with a state funeral the deceased would normally be expected to lie in state for three days in Westminster Hall to allow members of the public to pay their respects.

A total of 321,360 people filed past the catafalque while Sir Winston was lying in state.

It was in a piece about the lying-in-state of Sir Winston that the Daily Mail’s Vincent Mulchrone famously wrote: ‘Two rivers run silently through London tonight, and one is made of people. Dark and quiet as the night-time Thames itself, it flows through Westminster Hall, eddying about the foot of the rock called Churchill.’

Silent crowds watched as Churchill’s coffin left Westminster Hall as Big Ben struck 9.45am and started its journey through London, the skyline then dominated by the dome of St Paul’s and free from skyscrapers.

It was only 38 years later, in 2003, that the 591ft Gherkin was completed on the former site of the Baltic Exchange. Towering between it and St Paul’s now is also the Leadenhall Building, which will be 737ft when completed. Another notable change in the scene today is the removal of the railway bridge over Ludgate Hill.

By decree of the Queen, Sir Winston Churchill's body lay in State in Westminster Hall for three days and a state funeral service was held at St Paul's Cathedral in 1965

The echoes of Winston Churchill's funeral were felt throughout the day as Baroness Thatcher was laid to rest

At Sir Winston’s funeral the mourners were led by his wife, Lady Clementine Churchill, his son Randolph and daughters Mary Soames and Lady Sarah Audley.

The Queen and the Duke Edinburgh attended, as did the Queen Mother and the then teenage Prince Charles. Together with the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and representatives of 112 countries they packed into the cathedral for the service.

The Queen struck an almost identical pose to the one she adopted yesterday, with her handbag hooked over her left arm and her hands clutched in front of her, as she contemplated the loss of Sir Winston, the first of the 12 Prime Ministers to have served during her reign.

Whereas Baroness Thatcher was cremated after her funeral service, Sir Winston was laid to rest in the Oxfordshire parish churchyard of Bladon, close to Blenheim Palace where he was born 90 years before, with only family members present.
