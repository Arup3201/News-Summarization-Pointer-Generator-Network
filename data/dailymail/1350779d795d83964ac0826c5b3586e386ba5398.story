Carlos the Jackal, the flamboyant terrorist and self-proclaimed revolutionary who was once one of the Cold War's most wanted men, today launched an appeal against his life sentence for orchestrating bombings that killed 11 people in France two decades ago.

Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, is serving two life sentences in France for a triple murder in 1975 and for the bombings in France in 1982 and 1983. He's been behind bars since 1994 after French agents seized him in Sudan.

Today, as he launched an appeal, he demanded new lawyers and accused the Venezuelan state of seeking to sabotage his defence by not supplying promised financial support for his existing legal team.

When the court agreed to provide him 
with two lawyers funded by the French state, a laughing Ramirez called 
out 'one blonde, one brunette' - a remark for which he was rebuked by 
the court president.

Behind bars: Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, is serving two life sentences in France for a triple murder in
1975 and for bombings in France in 1982 and 1983 that killed 11 people 
and injured over 140

He was convicted of the triple murder in 1997 and the bombings in 2011 after a trial that captivated the world for months.

But now his lawyer, Isabelle
Coutant-Peyre, who is also his wife, is demanding he be sent back to 
his homeland of Venezuela on the grounds that his capture was illegal 
because he wasn't convicted of a crime until 17 years later.

For the defence: French lawyer Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, who is also married to Carlos the Jackal

His alleged ties to attacks by 
far-left and Palestinian terror groups made him feared among governments
in Western Europe and the Middle East, but also brought him admirers 
including the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

In France Ramirez began an appeal against his life sentence for the bombings. The hearing began with him demanding a new lawyer.

Ms Coutant-Peyre told one of Venezuela's state-run radio stations that she hoped to meet government officials to discuss the matter.

It has been 16 years since the 
Venezuelan was handed his first life sentence for the 1975 killing of two unarmed 
policemen and one of their informers in the French capital. For many, 
his 1997 incarceration in La Santé prison was the end of the story.

But in 2011, he was convicted of masterminding four attacks across France in 1982 and 1983, 
which killed 11 people and wounded more than 140.

But if there was any question that 
the ageing Jackal felt any remorse for his crimes, the clenched-fist 
salute he delivered at the end of that second trial in 2011 made his position very clear: the Marxist Islamist 
terrorist is still at war with the world.

Ramirez' long-running custody battle has, at times, been overshadowed by his love life, that saw him marry his lawyer, Ms Coutant-Peyre - a petite and highly distinguished 58-year-old barrister.

The couple married in La Santé prison 12 years ago, with Carlos handing over a platinum Cartier ring in front of armed guards, before returning to his cell alone.

Indeed, his thoughts at the moment appear to be less concerned with the horrific crimes of which he now stands accused - including causing an explosion on an express train which killed five people — than his 'human right' to consummate his marriage.

While his wife claims that - legally - too many years have passed for him to be tried for the bomb attacks, Carlos has been telling friends of his desire to assuage the 'burning passion' he and wife both hold for each other. He regularly sends the previously married mother-of-three love poems from his cell.

'Ten years is a long time. We have every right to be together and to be free,' said Carlos, during a recent telephone conversation with a close friend from inside La Santé. He has since been placed in solitary confinement for phoning out of the prison without permission.

'My wife has been waiting long enough and we deserve a honeymoon,' said Carlos during the call, adding: 'By the grace of God and wheeler-dealing between France and Venezuela, we'll get one.'

For her part, Madame Coutant-Peyre 
says she is determined to remould her husband's image as an unfeeling 
killing machine into that of warm human being who was 'illegally 
captured and imprisoned' by 'politically-motivated' police.

'He
is not a criminal,' she has said, 'but a politician, like Nelson Mandela.' 
She has pledged to clear his name 'for all time' and see him return to 
Venezuela as a released 'political prisoner'.

She has her work cut out in pleading his case: for Carlos's reign of terror stretches back to the early 1970s.

War with the world: If there was any question that the ageing Jackal felt any remorse for his crimes, the clenched-fist salute he delivered at a court appearance in 2011 made his position very clear

Rescuers and policemen are seen on the site where a bombed car exploded in Rue Marbeuf, near Champs Elysées in Paris on April 22, 1982. The attack was attributed to Carlos the Jackal

One person died and 63 were wounded in the 1982 Paris attack in front of the office of pro-Iraqi publication Al Watan al Arabi

The son of Left-wing millionaire 
Venezuelan lawyer Jose Altagracia Ramirez Navas, who named his three 
sons Vladimir, Ilich and Lenin after the leader of Russia's Bolshevik 
revolution, Carlos was a paid-up member of the Communist party by the 
age of ten, and spent time as an undergraduate at Moscow's Patrice 
Lumumba University, established by the Soviets as a training ground for 
revolutionaries from Africa, Asia and Latin America.

By
1970, he had volunteered for the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine — which is thought to have first given him the codename Carlos
because of his South American lineage — playing an active role for the 
group in the north of Jordan during the Black September conflict against
King Hussein's forces.

He was also allegedly a part of an attempt on the life of Joseph Sieff, the Jewish chairman of Marks & Spencer, in London.

In
1975 - the year he converted from Catholicism to Islam - he killed two 
unarmed policemen and one of their informers in Paris after they turned 
up at his hide-out flat on the Left Bank. He shot them dead and fled 
through a window, leaving his fingerprints on both the discarded gun and
a whisky bottle.

In
December that year, while still on the run, he became a household name 
after leading a six-man attack on the Vienna HQ of OPEC, the 
Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries.

Carlos,
flamboyantly handsome in sunglasses and a Che Guevara beret, took some 
70 people hostage, including 11 government ministers.

Three
hostages were killed, but dozens of others ended up being forced to fly
with him to Algeria, where a ransom - thought to have been in the 
region of £10 million was eventually paid for their return home.

Then in 1982 and 1983 he masterminded

But with the fall of the Berlin Wall 
in 1989, safe havens were harder to come by. Carlos took refuge in Sudan
but was finally captured in the capital Khartoum in 1994 by French 
secret servicemen who injected him with a sedative, bound and 
blindfolded him and flew him back to Paris.
