They've been dating for nearly two years but James Middleton and girlfriend Donna Air still keep the flame alive with regular date nights it seems.

The loved-up duo enjoyed a night out at the theatre and were spotted walking arm in arm as they left a production of War Horse at the London Theatre in Covent Garden.

Donna, 35, who is known for her chic sense of style, looked casual and cool in a leather skirt teamed with an on-trend khaki blazer complete with leather lapels. The £325 Aberlady jacket by Really Wild clothing - a firm favourite of James' sister Kate - has become a staple in Donna's wardrobe; it's the third time she's worn it.

Clearly things are getting serious between the pair, who recently enjoyed a family holiday in Geneva with Donna's 10-year-old daughter Freya.

The couple looked at ease with each other as they wheeled their luggage out of Heathrow Airport alongside Donna's little girl. 

James and Donna were rumoured to be engaged last June when the former Byker Grove actress attended the Serpentine Gallery summer party with a sparkling ring on her engagement finger.

They have since denied the speculation, but Donna recently admitting she isn’t averse to marriage, telling The Telegraph: ‘I’ve never been married so maybe one day I will do the wife thing.’
