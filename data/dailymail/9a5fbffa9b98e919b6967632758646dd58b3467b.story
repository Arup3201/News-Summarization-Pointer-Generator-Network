Two women who were were caught trying smuggling 13 rare iguanas they had stuffed into socks have been jailed for a year.

Romanian degree students Angla-Alina Bita, 26, and Vitora-Oliva Bucsa, 24,  were detained at Heathrow Airport after stepping off a BA fight from the 
Bahamas with the San Salvador Iguanas.

The women had planned to catch a connecting flight to Dusseldorf, Germany, where the animals, which have a potential black market value of £260,000, were due
 to be collected.

The animals are unique to the Bahamas, where laws have been passed to 
prevent their export and it is believed the species now only amounts to a
 few hundred.

Mechanical engineering student Angela-Alina Bita, 26, who was working as
 an au pair in Switzerland and finance student Victoria Olivia Bucsa, 
24, pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court to illegal importation.

Prosecutor Miss Pamela Reiss told Isleworth Crown Court the women 
arrived in the early hours from Nassau, claiming they had spent an 
innocent holiday in the Caribbean, which they had financed themselves.

The thirteen Iguanas, one of which was dead, had been stuffed inside a sock and then wrapped in a towel

All their clothes had been stuffed into one suitcase and Border Agency officers checked the second one they had.

'In
 the other suitcase the thirteen Iguanas, one of which was dead, were 
found. Each had been wrapped inside a sock and then wrapped in a blue 
towel.

'They had been in the hold in the suitcase during the eight-hour flight.

'They come from a hot country and were in the cold hold all that time and must have suffered.

'Brita said she did not know what they were and was given them by a man called ‘Robert’ in a beach bar and was not paid.'

It
 is unknown what the final destination was for the reptiles, but Miss 
Reiss added: 'They are valued at ten thousand pounds each and that’s a 
minimum, they could be sold illegally for up to twenty thousand pounds 
each.'

Judge Phillip Matthews told the first-time offenders, who have been 
locked-up in HMP Holloway since their arrest: 'You are two 
highly-intelligent, well travelled young women who chose to act in the 
way you did free of pressure.

'There is a market for such creatures 
and for as long as people such as yourselves perpetrate the facility for
 them to be smuggled out of the Bahamas that trade will continue.'

Grant
 Miller from the Border Force’s endangered species team said: 'This 
particular species of iguana in incredibly rare - only a few hundred are
 believed to be left in existence - so this was remarkable and very 
important seizure.

'Given the circumstances we found them in it seems incredible that all but one survived such a long flight.'

The animals were dehydrated and placed into the care of a specialist vet where they remain.

One of the 12 surviving iguanas smuggled which were discovered by customs at Heathrow Airport. The haul had a potential black market value of £260,000

'The rarity of this particular species made this an incredibly significant seizure. The iguanas are critically endangered and in effect priceless.

'This makes it all the more shocking that someone was willing to take them from their habitat and transport them halfway around the world in these kinds of conditions.

'We are now working with the Bahamian authorities to try to return them to where they belong.'

The women were on their way to Dusseldorf, Germany, with the San Salvador rock iguanas, which are native to the Bahamas and classed as being under threat of extinction.

The 12 lizards which survived the trip were given to experts in the UK, who aim to return them to the Caribbean.

Sarah Goddard, from WWF, said: 'At a time that criminal gangs are threatening the very future existence of some of our most precious animals, it is good to see UK authorities clamping down on the traffickers posing a serious threat to the survival of endangered species such as these iguanas.

'These convictions are a victory for all those fighting wildlife crime.'
