A dentist who funded a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle by conning the NHS out of £1.4million was behind bars last night.

In one of the most complex frauds of its kind, Joyce Trail filed more than 7,000 invoices for work never done – including fitting false teeth on patients who were actually dead.

She had not even met many of the patients she was invoicing about, having obtained their details by contacting care homes to advertise her services.

Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC said 
Trail, 50, frittered away the cash on holidays to the Caribbean islands 
of St Barts and Jamaica, as well as Miami, where she would go on 
spending sprees for Cartier jewellery, Prada clothes and Jimmy Choo 
shoes. When investigators searched her £1.25million six-bedroom gated 
home, they discovered dozens of boxes of designer shoes stacked up.

Trail was convicted of conspiracy to 
defraud yesterday at the end of a five-week trial at Birmingham Crown 
Court. Judge Peter Carr remanded the dentist in custody and warned her 
she faces a ‘substantial’ jail term when she returns to court for 
sentencing next month.

The judge told her: ‘You abused your 
position as a professional and you abused your position as a dentist. 
You have effectively stolen a large amount of money that was not 
available to an already overstretched health service.’

Miss Moore said investigators ‘smelt a
rat’ after trawling through files at her surgery in Handsworth, 
Birmingham. As part of a random check, officials from the NHS Business 
Services Authority contacted one of Trail’s supposed patients at his 
care home – and discovered he was a private patient who had not used an 
NHS dentist.

Realising the fake invoice could be 
the tip of the iceberg, they widened the investigation and Trail, from 
Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was eventually arrested.

Miss Moore told the jury 100 claims 
were made for treating patients who were dead, adding: ‘Dr Trail treated
people who lived in nursing homes and residential care a great deal of 
the time.

‘She double and triple-claimed for 
people that she had actually treated and then she used patient details 
which had been quite unwittingly supplied to her by nursing homes to 
claim for people that she had never even met.

‘It meant the practice received in the
order of £1.4million that it should not have done. But, moreover, Dr 
Trail then siphoned off money which enabled her to live a lavish 
lifestyle. She was globe-trotting, spending time at very exotic 
locations.

‘Her American Express bill was vast 
compared to what she was legitimately making from the business, but of 
course when it’s other people’s money it’s very easy to spend it.’

Miss Moore told the court: ‘Dr Trail 
claimed and was paid a great deal for treatment she had not performed – 
not just a few claims, not just a few clerical errors, but something in 
the order of £1.4million of false claims.’

Trail’s daughter, Nyri Sterling, 33, 
of Oldbury, West Midlands, was also convicted of conspiracy to defraud. 
She worked in the administration side of the practice and assisted Trail
in administering the fraud. Both women had denied the charges which 
relate to the period of April 2006 to March 2009.

A spokesman for NHS Birmingham and Solihull said Trail’s NHS contract had now been terminated.

He added: ‘Provisional arrangements 
have been put in place for patients at the practice to continue to 
receive NHS dentistry within the Handsworth area.’
