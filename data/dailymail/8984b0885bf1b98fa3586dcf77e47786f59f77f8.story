You may already be aware your Facebook use is bordering on addiction, but now a browser tool reveals the true extent of your social networking in a single picture.

Called Iconic History, the Chrome extension visualises every website you’ve ever visited by plotting your browsing history into an interactive graphic.

Pages are shown using favicons - low-resolution icons associated with sites - and are mapped according to the time and date they were visited.

Each URL on Chrome is timestamped with the date and hour it was accessed.

Once the Iconic History extension is installed, it scans web history for these stamps.

Many websites are also stamped with so-called favicons - low-resolution icons based on the site's logo, for example.

These icons are plotted, in date order, separated with markers.

Some websites don’t have dedicated favicons, and these will appear as blank white pages.

Hovering a mouse over each favicon reveals the name of the site and time it was accessed.

Each favicon represents a URL web address, as opposed to a single visit, meaning you may visit the site even more often than the favicon appears on the graph.

‘I spend so much time online every day, doing all sorts of things from working to socialising to just aimless wandering, I thought browser history alone could narrate a significant portion of my life and what was on my mind,’ said creator Shan Huang, a student at Carnegie Mellon University, in a blog post. 

‘My initial idea was to create a library of all webpages I viewed. I was curious about the equivalent amount of reading I would have done if all the webpages I had viewed were books.

‘I was planning on creating a book for each site visited - and the thickness of the book would be proportional by the total word count of all pages viewed under the site.

‘[But] while doing so, it became obvious 
that I also needed some sort of images for my book covers. I thought 
about favicons. In the 
process I accidentally created the graph.’

Each URL on Chrome is timestamped so pages can be sorted by date and hour.

Many of the favicons that appear on the graphic will be immediately recognisable, such as Facebook and Gmail, whereas others will be harder to identify.

Some websites also don’t have dedicated favicons, and these addresses will appear as blank white pages .

Hovering a mouse over each favicon reveals the name of the site and time it was accessed.

‘Ideally I would like to visualise visits because a ‘visit’ is the lowest-level unit of browser history. However Chrome only provides access to URLs timestamped by their last visit time, so my only option was to visualise [these].

'This gives us less data, but nevertheless it doesn’t take away the indicative power of the result,' added Huang.

Websites accessed via Chrome's Incognitio Mode are not plotted, neither are pages that a user has visited, but has since removed from the browser history.

If a user is signed into Chrome on various devices, the entire history from all of these places will be revealed.
