Following weak sales and a drop in profits at the end of last year, HTC may be turning its attention away from phones and towards wearables.

A source ‘familiar with the plans’ told Bloomberg the Taiwanese firm is planning to give previews of at least one smartwatch at next week’s Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona - but only to network operators.

The company is not expected to publicly announce a wearable device, however, until later in the year.

A source 'familiar with the plans' told Bloomberg that Taiwanese firm HTC is planning to give private previews of a smartwatch at next week's Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. The device is rumoured to be based on Qualcomm's Toq watch, pictured

The rumours state that HTC is working on three variations of a smartwatch or similar wearable device. 

The
 first is said to have been based on Qualcomm's Toq device.

HTC is additionally 
believed to be working on a bangle-type device that plays music and 
tracks the wearer’s fitness in a similar way to Fitbit and Nike’s 
Fuelband.

The Qualcomm Toq
 comes with optional headsets that can be used to control playback from a
 smartphone and instead of a music band, this rumour could be for a HTC version of this headset. 

The third rumour states HTC is working on a Google Now smartwatch. Google Now is similar to Apple’s personal assistant app Siri.

Experts believe HTC is working on three variations of a smartwatch, or similar wearable device. 

The first is said to have been based on Qualcomm's Toq device, meaning HTC’s watch could have the same, or similar, Mirasol colour touchscreen.

HTC is additionally believed to be working on a bangle-type device that plays music and tracks the wearer’s fitness in a similar way to Fitbit and Nike’s Fuelband.

The Qualcomm Toq comes with optional headsets that can be used to control playback from a smartphone, and instead of a music band, this rumour could be for a HTC version of this headset. 

The third rumour states HTC is working on a Google Now smartwatch. Google Now is similar to Apple’s personal assistant app Siri.

It uses predictive analysis to make informed guesses about what the user will do next, before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked.

Other rumours state HTC is working on a Google Now smartwatch as well as bangle-type device that plays music and tracks the wearer's fitness in a similar way to Fitbit and Nike's Fuelband. Google Now, pictured, is similar to Apple's personal assistant app Siri

Despite the critical success of its HTC One handset, pictured left, the manufacturer reported weak sales and a drop in profits at the end of last year. It is thought the company could be turning its attention to wearables to boost income and rival the likes of Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch, pictured right

For example, the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is, or should be.

It combines this with location data, taken from the phone or tablet’s GPS unit, as well as posts on social networks, email information and more.

It will then present the user with Cards designed to offer support or help it thinks they need, such as transport options or directions.

Reports earlier this year claimed a Google Now watch would be released at some point this year, and HTC may lead the way.

Sony was the first major firm to release it SmartWatch, followed shortly after by Samsung and its Galaxy Gear. Apple and Google are also rumoured to be working on similar devices.
