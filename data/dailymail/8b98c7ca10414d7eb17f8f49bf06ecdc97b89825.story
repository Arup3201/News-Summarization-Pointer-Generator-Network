Hillary Clinton was today bombarded with personal questions by a Philippines audience on subjects from whether she thinks her daughter should go into politics to what music she has on her iPad.

The U.S. Secretary of State, who is America's outspoken advocate for democracy, was questioned by students about her daughter Chelsea - and told them she doesn’t want her to go into politics.

Meanwhile the 64-year-old revealed her favourite music artists are the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Doors - but she also listens to classic music for relaxation.

Questions: Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is America's outspoken advocate for democracy, was questioned by students about her daughter Chelsea - and told them she doesn't want her to go into politics

Say cheese: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton poses for souvenir shots following her question and answer session in Manila, Philippines, on Wednesday

‘What's in your purse?’ someone asked 
via Twitter. ‘In addition to makeup and all that go with that, usually 
my Blackberry and papers of all kinds,’ Mrs Clinton replied at Manila's 
National Museum.

She spoke 
to students after meetings with President Benigno Aquino III and other 
officials to tackle heavy issues such as South China Sea territorial 
disputes and the U.S.-Philippines defense alliance.

Mrs
 Clinton said she uses her iPad mainly to view news sites but also uses 
it for music, and revealed her favourite artists. ‘I'm a child of the 
'60s, which is before any of you were born,’ she said.

‘So
 everything I grew up with - the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, the Who 
and the Doors. I mean, all of that, plus I like classical music because I
 find it relaxing when I'm thinking about stressful things.’

Mrs Clinton also told the audience that she wants a grandchild but is ‘leaving that to my daughter and her husband’. ‘Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to experience that,’ she said.

'Break on Through (To the Other Side)' - The Doors [Calling China to improve its human rights record]

'An American In Paris' - George Gershwin [A little classical music for her visits to see Nicolas Sarkozy in France]

Her daughter Chelsea got married to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky last year and told New York Magazine that she wants to have children with him.

She also began working at NBC News this week.

Mrs Clinton said she would not recommend her daughter getting into politics. Last month it was claimed Chelsea was on the verge of launching her own political career with a run for Congress.

Her mother recalled former president Franklin D. Roosevelt's wife Eleanor's advice to would-be politicians.

‘If you get into politics, you have to grow a skin as thick as the rhinoceros because it can be very painful if you're not prepared - you're going to be subjected to all these criticisms,’ Mrs Clinton said.

Moments after saying this a student 
activist stood up from the crowd and held up a poster opposing a treaty 
that allows U.S. troops and ships to visit the Philippines, a former 
American colony.

Surprise: Hillary Clinton was posing for a photo op on Saturday in Hawaii with Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang when a half-naked man streaked by. She then joked about the incident 
with photographers

As he was led out by security, the 
student yelled, ‘Junk U.S. imperialism.’ The moderator then asked 
Clinton about her attitude toward protesters, who hound American 
officials like her everywhere.

‘People have the right to have opinions that are different from others - that what's democracy is about,’ she said.

‘And the Philippines has a very vibrant democracy, where people are unafraid to express themselves.

'I'm pretty much used to it. But it goes with that rhinoceros skin'

Her comments came days after she roared with laughter when a half-naked man interrupted a photo call in Hawaii when he ran behind her carrying a flaming torch and wearing nothing but a loincloth.
