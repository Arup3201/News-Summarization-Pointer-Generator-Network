Troubled: Michelle Dion, 28, reportedly checked herself out of rehab only days before her DUI arrest this week

Employees at a Connecticut McDonald’s called police after an intoxicated woman fresh out of rehab came through the drive-thru window with her toddler daughter in the back seat.

Michelle Dion, 28, of Springfield, was arrested Wednesday evening by police in Clinton, Connecticut, after her car ran out of gas in the fast food joint’s parking lot. Dion had reportedly been in rehab as recently as last week.

The baby had no injuries when taken into custody, police said. Dion left a rehabilitation facility last week, WTNH reported. It is not clear if she left a treatment plan early or completed one.

‘I’m an employee at McDonalds and we have a situation that we think a lady is driving drunk with her kid in the car,’ the quick-thinking worker told the dispatcher. 

The call came after Dion went to the Southern Connecticut restaurant around 7.30 p.m. after a boozy day at the beach with her two-year-old daughter, police said.

Employees claimed to have smelled alcohol on her breath while helping push her car out of the drive-thru lane, according to audio of the 911 call posted by WTNH.

Dion claimed to have only had ‘two glasses of wine earlier in the day,’ according to a police report cited by the station, but officers said the woman was ‘slurring her words and had ‘red, glassy bloodshot eyes.’

The bombed blonde then failed multiple field sobriety tests, even losing her balance, and refused a Breathalyzer before being taken into custody, cops said.

‘Dion lost her balance several times during the walk and turn,’ police told WTNH.

When asked to recite the alphabet, she stopped at the letter ‘v,’ a police report cited by WVIT said.

The woman’s daughter was taken into protective custody before eventually be released to her mother, who revealed Dion had checked herself out rehab only last week, WTNH reported.

Dion does not have a prior criminal record, and was released on a promise to reappear for her next court hearing on charges of DUI and risk of injury to a minor.

She was shown on WTNH sprinting out of court while wearing a blue hoodie and ignoring questions from reporters as she jumped into a waiting SUV.

The troubled woman also agreed to seek further help for her drinking problem and cooperate with the state Department of Children and Families.
