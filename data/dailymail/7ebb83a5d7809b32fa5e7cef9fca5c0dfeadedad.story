Roberto Martinez is backing Phil Jagielka to prove he is still one of England’s best defenders and show he is an improved player for his experience at the World Cup.

There are question marks over Jagielka’s long-term prospects in the England squad, given he was criticised for his role in the defeats against Italy and Uruguay that condemned Roy Hodgson’s squad to an early exit.

Martinez, though, has no such worries about his captain heading into the new Barclays Premier League campaign and believes the 31-year-old has recovered sufficiently from a draining experience to show why he can still lead his club and country’s defence.

‘When you have been in a tournament like the World Cup, the days after it can be very raw and you have emotions,’ said Martinez. ‘You need a proper break and, by that, I mean time to get a proper perspective on things, time with your family and four weeks away from football.

‘The mind-set changes then and the experience of playing in a World Cup then gives you a head start on players who have never been there. That is the way I have seen the players come back from the World Cup - Phil, Leighton Baines, Ross Barkley.

‘They all had different experiences and have come back feeling they are better players for the experience they had I think his experience will make him more determined and a better player, he will be able to anticipate things and reach another level.’

Jagielka himself feels he has recovered but says it will only be after Everton have got through their opening three tussles – after Leicester they face Arsenal and Chelsea – will know how much, if any, scarring remains.

‘It was difficult watching the World Cup at home,’ said Jagielka. ‘We went away with Turkey with the family and there was not much TV on. You try to forget about it, get run ragged by the kids, get thrown in the pool. It is the best medicine to be perfectly honest.

‘I didn’t want to be in Turkey that early in the summer. Anti-climax would probably be an under-statement. It is frustrating not to have been able to stay out longer. I would have preferred for us to have played worse, got more points and snuck through. It wasn’t meant to be.’
