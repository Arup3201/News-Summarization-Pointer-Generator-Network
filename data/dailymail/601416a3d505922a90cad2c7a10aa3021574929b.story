Drivers who ignore dashboard warning lights face MoT failure or costly repairs from today.

Tough Europe-wide test standards come into force to catch up with the rise of  in-car electronics.

There will be more than 20 additional checks on areas such as brakes, steering, suspension and lighting.

Thousands of drivers who ignore their dashboard warning lights for 
things such as tyre pressure and brake light checks, could face fines 
under the new Europe wide rules

The changes also include tyre pressure monitoring systems, xenon lights and airbag and seatbelt checks.

Andy Smith, the AA's patrolman of the
year, said: 'If you've been happily ignoring a warning light because 
it's not part of the MoT, these changes mean your car could now be on 
the MoT scrapheap or you'll need to fork out on expensive repairs.

'While it could have costly 
consequences for someone running an old car on a tight budget, these 
changes are long overdue as airbags, for example, have been widely 
fitted since the mid-90s.

'It's important these systems remain safe and effective throughout the life of the vehicle.'

Drivers could face MoT failure or costly repairs as the tough new Europe-wide test standards come into force tomorrow, the AA has warned

The Vehicle and Operator Service 
Agency said the new regulations will not affect the basic cost of a 
test, which must be carried out annually on vehicles over three years 
old.

The changes aim to establish minimum 
technical standards across Europe and include basic checks such as the 
steering wheel lock and driver's seat adjustment.

The test will also 
cover: electronic power steering indicator lamp; brake fluid warning 
lamp; engine mountings; speedometer; seats; headlight beam warning 
lights; and electronic parking brake controls.

The new checks have been included in 
MoTs since the start of 2012 but on an advisory-only basis. From today 
any defects could mean a failed test.

Rory Carlin, of Halfords Autocentres,
said: 'We have been preparing for these changes and offering advice to 
motorists for more than a year now in order to help them stay on the 
road and ensure the safety of the vehicles they drive. It is best to 
have your vehicle properly serviced before submitting it for a test.'

The MoT was introduced in 1960 by transport minister Ernest Marples. It costs a maximum of £54.85 for a standard car.
