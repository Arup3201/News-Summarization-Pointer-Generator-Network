Tragic: Little Harry Connolly died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after being sent home by doctors three times in three days

A boy of 19 months died despite being seen by four doctors in three days, an inquest heard yesterday.

Harry Connolly’s parents begged for their son to be kept in hospital after he was admitted suffering severe diarrhoea and dehydration.

But doctors there failed to carry out vital tests on the toddler, instead dismissing his illness and advising his parents, Lucy and Raymond, to take their son home.

A fourth, from a GP out-of-hours service, also failed to spot that Harry was seriously ill or refer him to hospital for treatment despite the fact the little boy appeared ‘lifeless’.

Instead Harry died at home in his sleep, four days after he was first taken to hospital. A post-mortem examination revealed he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering from an inflammation of the colon, which had not been spotted.

Coroner Anne Pember criticised doctors at Northampton General Hospital  and a GP’s out-of-hours service.

Horrifying: Less than five days after his first trip to hospital, at 4am on May 1 Harry's father found him tragically dead in his bed

She said he could have survived had he
been re-admitted to hospital and given proper treatment.

Last night 
Harry’s parents, who have two older sons, said he had died needlessly 
because of ‘sub-standard’ care.

Mrs Connolly, 29, said: ‘I kept 
telling the medical staff that Harry was extremely sick but nobody would
listen. Three opportunities to save my son were wasted.’

A two-day inquest in Northampton was told Harry fell ill at his home in the town on April 23 last year.

Mrs Connolly, an administrative 
assistant, took him to his GP three days later and, on the doctor’s 
advice, he was admitted to NGH later that evening.

Harry was then 
examined by a paediatrician who said he was not dehydrated, but she 
recommended he be given Dioralyte, a rehydration treatment to boost his 
salt and sugar levels.

At 10.30am the next day, a second 
doctor recommended Harry be  discharged and his parents given ‘48-hour 
open access’ to the children’s ward, which meant they could bring him 
back at any time.

Mrs Connolly returned with him the 
next day. But a third doctor refused to believe he was dehydrated and 
sent him home. The next day – Good Friday – Harry’s grandmother was so 
concerned that the toddler had ‘sunken eyes’ she phoned the hospital. 
But a nurse could not find Harry’s notes which showed he had ‘48-hour 
access’. She told the family they would have to go through A&E or 
their GP out-of-hours service, South East Health Limited.

Out-of-hours GP Aboo Thamby said the 
boy had a virus but was not dehydrated and did not need to go to 
hospital. The next day Harry was still poorly but seemed brighter. He 
went to bed at 9pm and was discovered dead in his cot in the early hours
by his father. In a narrative verdict, Mrs Pember described the 
disorganised arrangements for the ‘open 48-hour ward access’ system as 
‘catastrophic’.

She blamed doctors’ decisions not to 
weigh Harry or take blood and urine samples from him for their failure 
to diagnose his condition.

Mr and Mrs Connolly are suing NGH and have lodged complaints to the General Medical Council about two of the doctors involved.

The hospital has apologised and said changes had been made.
