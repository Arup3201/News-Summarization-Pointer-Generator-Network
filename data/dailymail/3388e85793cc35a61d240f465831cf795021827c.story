With the midnight Monday deadline for Obamacare looming, Americans across the country are waiting hours in line, on hold and overrunning HealthCare.gov as they rush to sign-up for coverage before getting penalized.

Last-minute registrations caused the HealthCare.gov site to crash again late Friday, but it was up and running again over the weekend despite handling a massive 50,000 users at once.

As of Sunday the website was running well and response times were less than half a second, though White House officials expect traffic to peak on Monday.

Americans ran into the same issues offline, as they waited hours in line and on hold at service and call centers while seeking assistance with their applications.

Call centers were ill-equipped to keep up with the demand of callers, despite the government adding representatives ahead of the deadline. Call centers received a record 2.5million calls in the week leading up to today's deadline, which is more than the 2.4million calls they received for the entire month of February.

The wait time for those ringing the call center was so bad that one woman in Kansas City, Missouri came into a health services center crying because she used up all her pre-paid minutes on hold.

Representatives at Swope Health Service helped that woman by letting her use the phone there.

Enrollment officials at Swope also hired an extra security guard predicting more visitors, and according to the Wall Street Journal a few of the people in line did get 'belligerent'

In Silver Springs, Maryland, hundreds of people queued up hours before the local health service center opened at 10am just to receive one of the 200 pink tickets to insure an appointment that day. By 10:30 all of the tickets were handed out and the rest of the people in line signed their name to receive an extension.

'We've been overwhelmed,' Mary Anderson, a spokeswoman for the county's health department, told the Journal. She told the crowd: 'Go home. We'll call you back.'

Those who have attempted to sign up for health care and haven't been able to receive assistance to finish their application will qualify for an extension.

But those without a valid excuse for being uninsured come April 1 will receive a penalty determined by their household income.

Everyone making less than $19,650 a year will receive a flat rate of $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, not to exceed $285 per family. Everyone making more than that amount will be hit with a fee equal to 1 per cent of their income.

On Thursday, President Obama announced that 6million Americans have signed up for health care, but it's still uncertain how many were uninsured before.

Republicans opposed to the the new act called out Obama's estimates as bloated.

'I think they're cooking the books on this,' Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming told Fox News. 'Once all this is said and done, what kind of insurance will those people actually have? ...How much more is it going to cost them?'

Data obtained from individual states show that the number of first-time insurers may be surprising.

According to data from New York State, 70 per cent of those who have signed up for health care have not had insurance before.
