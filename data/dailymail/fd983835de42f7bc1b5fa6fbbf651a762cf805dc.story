Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham Hotspur can expect to win major silverware within two years but warned of suffering in store in the meantime.

The Spurs manager said: ‘Sometimes to change something you need time. You need to suffer and have the bad moments. We know we’re heading in the right direction.

‘It may be in six months, one year, or two years. But I’m sure in the end the club will achieve a very important trophy.’

Spurs sit third in their Europa League group and host Greek Super League side Asteras Tripolis on Thursday. They slipped to ninth in the Barclays Premier League with a 4-1 defeat at Manchester City on Saturday. But, despite winning just two of their last nine games, they are still only two points away from the Champions League places.

It is by no means a crisis. The worry, perhaps, is that key personnel are struggling to deliver. Roberto Soldado, a £26million striker with just six goals in 31 league appearances, had his penalty saved by Joe Hart as he made his first league start of the season against City, while Emmanuel Adebayor has scored once this campaign.

Add defensive frailties in the big games - they have also lost 3-0 at home to Liverpool - and it is easy to see why Spurs have the worst goal difference in the top half of the table. Pochettino conceded that results were a concern, but was looking at the bigger picture.

‘We need to start scoring goals but we have confidence in our strikers,’ he said. ‘We made a lot of changes at the beginning of the season with our squad and had to implement a different philosophy on the group.

‘The same happened at Southampton when we arrived. Maybe in four or five months we will have changed the mentality. We need time, then we are confident we will show more consistency.’

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has a reputation for being quick to press the ‘manager eject’ button, with 10 different managers passing through White Hart Lane during his 13-year tenure so far. But Pochettino insisted he and the board were on the same page.

‘When they offered me the job Daniel was very clear with me and explained a little bit how we need to move the club on,’ he said. ‘We agreed - we want to build something special at Tottenham, different but better than before.’

The building process continues this evening as Spurs host Asteras Tripolis, who top Group C after beating Partizan Belgrade in the last game and holding Besiktas to a draw. Spurs drew both their previous matches.

The Greeks’ squad contains seven Argentines, including strikers Facundo Parra and Pablo Mazza. And Pochettino, a former Argentina international, knows how dangerous his countrymen can be.

‘It is a very good team,’ said Pochettino. ‘I know a lot about the Argentinians and they are very good. They are offensive, brave and we expect a tough game.’

Left back Ben Davies, who has found first team football hard to come by since arriving from Swansea in the summer, is expected to start.

Davies, 21, said he would not throw his toys out of the pram as he competes with Danny Rose for a starting spot at Spurs.

Pochettino was coy about whether Davies would soon be his first choice. ‘He’s still young,’ he said. ‘We knew when we signed him what his potential is but it is competition for Danny Rose.

‘I have a strong squad but we need to put the players on the pitch who can get three points (on Thursday). It’s a very important game.’
