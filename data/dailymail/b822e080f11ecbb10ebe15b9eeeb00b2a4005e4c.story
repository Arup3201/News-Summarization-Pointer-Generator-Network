A Detroit-area man who fatally shot a drunk, unarmed woman on his porch will stand trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter, a judge ruled Thursday, rejecting a self-defense argument for the killer's 'bad choice.'

There is no dispute that Theodore Wafer shot Renisha McBride, 19, through the screen of his front door in the early hours of November 2. His attorneys said he feared for his life, but Dearborn Heights Judge David Turfe said Wafer had other options.

'We can't allow (someone) to use a bad decision as a shield to criminal prosecution... The defendant made a bad choice,' the judge said.

Murder: Detroit-area man Theodore Wafer, pictured in court Thursday, who fatally shot a drunk, unarmed black woman on his porch will stand trial for second-degree murder, a judge ruled

Bad choice: Wafer's attorneys said he feared for his life, but Dearborn Heights Judge David Turfe, pictured, said Wafer had other options

Wafer's attorney, Cheryl Carpenter, pointed to Michigan's 2006 self-defense law.

'If someone is breaking into a home there is a presumption that a homeowner can use deadly force,' she argued. 'You don't know how many people are out there... There's violent banging on the front door. We have a man alone in his home.'

But Wayne County assistant prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark said it's 'ridiculous' to believe that Wafer was deeply afraid but still decided to open the door and fire instead of first calling the police.

'He shoved that shotgun in her face and pulled the trigger,' Hagaman-Clark said.

Wafer, 54, called 911 around 4:30 a.m. and said he had shot someone who was banging on his door.

More than three hours earlier, McBride had crashed her car into a parked car in a residential neighborhood, about a half-mile away in Detroit.

A witness said McBride was bleeding and holding her head, but that she walked away from the scene before an ambulance arrived. It's still unclear, at least publicly, what she did between the time of the car wreck and her arrival on Wafer's porch.

An autopsy found McBride had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.22, more than twice the legal limit for driving. She also had been smoking marijuana.

Her best friend, Amber Jenkins, 18, said they had been drinking vodka and playing cards seven to eight hours before the shooting was reported to 911.

Spectators, mostly McBride's family and friends, left the courtroom immediately after the judge's decision. Wafer lingered and appeared dazed as he stood and looked out a courtroom window. He thanked his attorneys and eventually left through a back door.

Carpenter told reporters the ruling was a disappointment.

Before hearing final arguments, the judge rejected Carpenter's request to play Wafer's one-hour recorded statement to police. It was not introduced by prosecutors when they presented evidence Wednesday.

Hagaman-Clark, citing Michigan court rules, successfully argued that the defense could play the video only if Wafer would agree to testify and open himself up to cross-examination.

'I want to go home': Witness Carmen Beasley provided details in court Wednesday about the hours preceding the death of McBride, who she says was scared, dazed and drunk after she had crashed into Beasley's car

'The videotaped statement is not subject to cross-examination,' the prosecutor said.

The news comes a day after a witness testified that the young woman was hurt, scared and confused a few hours earlier when she crashed her vehicle into a parked car.

Carmen Beasley provided details about the hours preceding McBride's shocking death.

Defense attorneys claimed he feared for
 his life, but prosecutors say the shooting was not justified.

Beasley said she heard a 'boom' outside her Detroit home about 1 a.m. and discovered that her car had been smashed.

She called 911, went outside and found McBride, who had walked away but returned to the scene.McBride was bleeding and pressing her hands to her head, Beasley testified.

'She couldn't find her phone. She was patting her pockets. ... She just kept saying she wanted to get home,' Beasley said.

Beasley went back into her house to call an ambulance, but McBride had walked away again by the time help arrived.

McBride was 'discombobulated' and 
appeared to be in a 'confused state of not knowing where she was and not
 being able to give a phone number or anything', said Beasley, who 
believed the young woman was drunk.

There was no testimony about where McBride went during the next few hours as rain fell and temperatures dipped to the 40s. But she somehow ended up blocks away on Wafer's porch in Dearborn Heights.

Around 4:30 a.m., he called 911 to report that he had shot someone who was 'banging on my door.'

A photo of McBride's legs taken by police showed her left foot had broken through the sole of her boot.

Detective
 Sgt. Steve Gurka said Wafer's Mossberg shotgun was found inside near 
the front door with the spent shell still inside the firearm. A gun case was found on the floor in another area of the house.

Testifying for the defense, firearms expert David Balash said Wednesday he believes the screen in the outer door was out of its frame before the shot was fired, a theory that suggests McBride may have knocked it out of place and raised Wafer's fears. Prosecutors disagree.

The shooting: Experts demonstrated the steps necessary to fire the shotgun during the court examination on Wednesday

Dr. Kilak Kesha, who conducted the 
autopsy on McBride, testified that her blood-alcohol level was about 
0.22, more than twice the legal limit for driving, but probably was even
 higher before she was shot because levels drop over time.

He said she had been using marijuana.

Immediately
 after Ms McBride's death Wafer apparently claimed he pulled the trigger
 by accident, but in recent days his lawyer has said he was in fear for 
his life - despite his size.

During
 cross-examination, defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter focused on 
alcohol, drugs and a possible head injury from the car crash.

'Could a person get more aggressive after a brain injury?' she asked.

'That's possible,' Kesha replied, later saying McBride 'absolutely' could have been quiet and withdrawn while drunk.

The prosecution implied that no damage or usable fingerprints on the outside door handles or screens indicated the teen was not trying to break in but was, instead, looking for help, according to Fox News.

The defense argued back saying the door wasn't tested for prints immediately after the shooting and that it was raining the night of the incident.

The court showed pictures from the scene including McBride's crashed car. Experts also demonstrated the steps necessary to fire the shotgun.

In the courtroom, McBride's supporters wore shirts bearing her image and the message, 'Don't shoot. Call 911.'

They wish Wafer had called police instead of shooting McBride from inside his home.
