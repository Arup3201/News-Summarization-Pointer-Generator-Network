A retail executive is accused in a lawsuit of pilfering millions from his own company after his brother’s death in 2001.

Mitchell Modell, CEO of Modell’s Sporting Goods, is being sued by brother Michael Modell’s widow Abby Modell for not equally sharing in the company’s profits per the terms of his estate, and instead splurging on extravagances like a $116,000 dinner Morton's Steakhouse in Chicago.

The fourth-generation company head claims in a legal filing that he and his late brother made a handshake agreement before his death from Hodgkin’s Disease that gave him three times the profits of the family he left behind, according to the New York Post.

Mitchell Modell, 59, was put in charge of his brother’s estate after his passing, and has used his position to pad his pockets while hanging Abby Modell and her children out to dry, claims the suit.

‘Mitchell’s complete want of understanding of his duties as a fiduciary is best summed up using his own words: ‘Mitchell Modell is Modell’s Sporting Goods, and Modell’s Sporting Goods is Mitchell Modell,’ says the scathing suit, according to the Post.

The brothers each controlled half of the family business started in 1889 before Micahel Modell’s death, according to Abby Modell.

His passing saw Mitchell Modell made CEO of the firm – his first order of business was to raise his salary from $1.8million to $6.275million, court papers showed.

Mitchell Modell also spent millions in company money on himself and his family, including $38,655 for a Canadian fishing trip, $103,000 for a Barbados vacation, $9,000 in massages at the Friar’s Club and $180,000 for a trophy that was once owned by Yankee catcher Thurman Munson.

The charges on his corporate card were egregious enough that the IRS twice-audited Mitchel Modell, in 2006 and 2007, over entertainment, meals and travel expenses.

The tax man found $1.5million of the ‘expenses’ to not be business related, but it is not cleatr exactly which charges were wiped from the business ledger.

Mitchell Modell is also battling a lawsuit from rival Dick’s Sporting Goods in which the retail chain claims he impersonated a company executive to ‘gain access to a Princeton store’s private operations.’

Abby Modell’s lawyer cites this suit as further proof of his ‘unsuitability to run the family business,’ the Post reported.

The northeast-centric chain has more than 150 stores from Virginia to New Hampshire, with the bulk of them in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area.
