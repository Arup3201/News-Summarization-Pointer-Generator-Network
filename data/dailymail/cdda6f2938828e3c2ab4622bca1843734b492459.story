It took a piece of quick thinking from Nicky Law to provide the edge as Rangers clinically avoided Ally McCoist’s fears of another stumble on a plastic pitch.

Days after a dismal draw on the synthetic surface at part-time Alloa, the Ibrox midfielder grabbed the initiative when he bypassed the 3G pitch at Falkirk which McCoist so dislikes to signpost a route into the quarter-finals of the League Cup for the Glasgow giants.

With Rangers struggling on the deck, Law cleverly lofted a headed through-ball over Falkirk’s shaky backline, allowing Dean Shiels — who had missed two fine earlier chances — to fire a high shot beyond Jamie MacDonald and give McCoist’s men a foot in Wednesday's last-eight draw.

Ian Black duly made sure both feet were planted in the quarter- finals with a scintillating 25-yarder high into the top corner in the dying seconds.

It was the kind of strike worthy of winning any game.

The goals made for a just result against a Falkirk side which had started like a train, scoring in five minutes through Rory Loy, before conceding just three minutes later via an own goal by Owain Tudur Jones.

McCoist had made two changes from the side that started at Alloa on Saturday. Injured duo Lewis Macleod and Nicky Clark, who both scored in a stuffy 2-0 win for Rangers in the Championship at Falkirk last month, were replaced by Lee Wallace and Shiels.

And, in what started as a high-octane first half at Westfield, the Northern Irishman could have had his side ahead within 60 seconds. A long ball deceived Will Vaulks and Liam Dick and Shiels ran clear on goal, only to be thwarted by a brave diving save by MacDonald.

Falkirk had not scored a goal in four games in the competition since knocking Rangers out of the 2011 League Cup 3-2 here at Westfield. But in a match watched by scouts from Swansea, Sheffield Wednesday, Birmingham City and Southampton, the Bairns soon put that right when Craig Sibbald fed Tom Taiwo who in turn teed up Blair Alston on the right edge of the box.

The Falkirk midfielder’s strong shot was poorly parried by Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen into the path of the predatory Loy. And the former Ibrox trainee made no mistake, ramming the ball gleefully into the net from six yards.

Could the home side build on their lead — or at least hold on to it for long enough to build a foundation in the game? The answer was quick in coming when Stevie Smith sent in a terrific delivery from the left and the ball was diverted high past MacDonald and into his own net by the hapless Tudur Jones.

It was chance-a-minute stuff by this stage and when Rangers again streaked clear beyond the Falkirk defence, Kris Boyd cleverly fed Shiels. This time, however, his shot was saved terrifically by MacDonald and his follow-up effort was blocked in an extravagant fashion by David McCracken’s backheel.

When Black saw a fine 25-yarder skid narrowly wide of MacDonald’s post it allowed everyone in the 5,259 crowd to regain their breath. They were being treated to a fine contest and next to threaten was Taiwo, who took a pass from Joe Shaughnessy before sending a 20-yard curler a fraction wide of hitting the top left corner of the Rangers net.

Sadly, the rest of the first-half petered out, without the goal action that had marked the opening exchanges.

And early in the second period, no doubt frustrated by his side’s failure to create further chances, McCoist sent on David Templeton — whose late goal rescued Rangers from embarrassment at Alloa on Saturday — to replace the ineffectual Fraser Aird.

Yet it was Law who set up the goal Rangers so coveted. He headed forward to allow Shiels to advance on MacDonald. The keeper did manage to get a glove on his shot but it was not enough to stop the ball ending up in the net.

Shiels would later depart to a standing ovation as he made way for 18-year-old Rangers debutant Ryan Hardie.

Black, who believes Rangers can win this competition for their first cup win since 2011, then made their passage safe by smashing in a terrific third goal from 25 yards into the top left corner.

It was a fittingly classy end to what had been a pulsating encounter.
