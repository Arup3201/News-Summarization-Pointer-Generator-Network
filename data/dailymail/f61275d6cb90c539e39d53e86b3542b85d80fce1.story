Prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty for Jodi Arias despite a jury being unable to reach a verdict on whether she should be executed.

Arias, a former waitress from California,
was found guilty last month of killing Travis Alexander, whose body was
found slumped in the shower of his Phoenix-area home in June 2008.

He 
had been stabbed 27 times, had his throat slashed and was shot in the 
face.

Prosecutors have revealed they will still pursue a death penalty for Jodi Arias, pictured here before the jury's non-decision in her sentencing was handed down

Arias says the killing was self-defense, and that on the day of Alexander's death, he attacked her and she was forced to fight for her life.

However, no other evidence - other than Arias' accounts - has been presented at trial showing Alexander had ever been physically violent.

Authorities say Arias planned the attack. She initially denied involvement then blamed it on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, she said it was self-defense.

Following the deadlock, the jury foreman claimed he is has been threatened with hate mail, with strangers saying they will kill him for failing to sentence Arias to death.

'Today I read hate mail my dad had gotten,' the son of foreman William Zervakos wrote on his blog.

'Some person had sent him a threatening message complete with his email address, full name, and phone number (which at the very least means that this guy should retake Hate Mail 101).'

Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months

The state of Arizona now has the 
option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial, which would 
require a new jury be empanelled, NBCNews.com reported.

If there is another deadlock, a judge 
would sentence Arias to natural life in prison, or life with the 
possibility of parole after 25 years.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill 
Montgomery told reporters prosecutors would ask a new sentencing jury to
do what the previous one could not - put Arias to death.

'At this point, we are still preparing to move forward to retry the penalty phase,' Montgomery told a news conference.

New target: William 'Bill' Zervakos has received death threats in the wake of the Jodi Arias trail where he and the other jury members failed to punish her with the death penalty

Mr Zervakos has previously explained that the jury aced a decision that was wrenching and real, with implications that could haunt them forever.

He said the jury struggled with one 
specific question in their private deliberations: How heinous of a 
killing deserves a similar fate?

'The
system we think is flawed in that sense because this was not a case of a
Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson,' Zervakos told The Associated Press.

'It was a brutal no-win situation. ... I think that's kind of unfair,' the 69-year-old added.

'We're
not lawyers. We can't interpret the law. We're mere mortals. And I will
tell you I've never felt more mere as a mortal than I felt for the last
five months.'

Zervakos 
said the most difficult time of the entire trial was hearing directly 
from victim's family as his brother and sister tearfully explained how 
his killing has shattered their lives.

'There was no sound in that jury room for a long time after that because you hurt so bad for these people,' he said.

'But that wasn't evidence. That's what
made it so hard.... This wasn't about them. This was a decision whether
we're going to tell somebody they were going to be put to death or 
spend the rest of their life in prison.'

Zervakos
described a deliberations room full of tears and spinning moral 
compasses as each juror struggled to come to grips with their own 
beliefs about what factors - including Arias' young age at the time of 
the killing and her lack of criminal history - should cause them to show
mercy and spare her life.

'You've
got Travis Alexander's family devastated, that he was killed, that he 
was brutally killed. You've got Jodi Arias' family sitting in there, 
both families sitting and seeing these humiliating images and listening 
to unbelievably lurid private details of their lives, and you've got a 
woman whose life is over, too,' Zervakos said.

'I mean, who's winning in this situation? And we were stuck in the middle.'

Zervakos
declined to discuss his thoughts or those of other jurors on whether 
Arias should have been sentenced to death or life. But he said he was 
torn between her two personas: a killer and an average young woman 
struggling through life.

'You heard (prosecutor Juan) Martinez say she was only 27.... She's old enough that she should have known better,' Zervakos said.

'I didn't look at it that way. I'm looking at 27 years of an absolutely normal everyday young woman that was living a life that was perfectly normal.

'Then something changed the trajectory of her life after meeting Travis Alexander, and it spiraled downhill from there.'
