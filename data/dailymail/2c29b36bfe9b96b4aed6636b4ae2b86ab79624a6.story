David Cameron paid tribute to the spirit of Boston's people today as he visited the site of the marathon bombings that devastated the city a month ago.

The Prime Minister was accompanied by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick as he toured the memorials that have been piling up in Copley Square since the atrocity that left three people dead and more than 260 injured.

'Everyone in the UK stands with your great city and your great people,' Mr Cameron told reporters gathered in the square.

Mr Cameron said it was crucial to challenge the 'narrative of violent extremism'.

That meant 'standing for the values that we believe in', such as freedom, democracy and diversity.

'We know how important it is to stand up and say the terrorists will not win,' the premier added.

'We will never give in to terrorists.'

The tribute came on the second day of Mr Cameron's three-day trip to the US.

In Washington yesterday, he held talks with President Barack Obama on issues including Syria, Iran and global trade. However, he has been unable to escape the spectre of Tory jousting over the EU at home.

'Believe in Boston': The explosions close to the finish line of the marathon on April 15 left three people dead and hundreds injured

Mr Cameron appeared solemn as he surveyed the hundreds of tributes to the victims of the bombings; from candles, flags and handwritten messages, to t-shirts and running shoes.

The makeshift memorial has been growing ever since the April 15 explosions close to the finish line of the world-famous Boston Marathon.

Spectators Krystle Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard all died in the blasts.

Hundreds more were injured in the explosions on marathon day, with many losing limbs.

Victims: Spectators Krystle Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard all died in the blasts close to the finish line of the marathon on April 15

The bombs, described by experts as 
makeshift anti-personnel devices, were found to have been made from 
pressure cookers packed with shrapnel and ball bearings to cause maximum
injuries to bystanders.

Police
believe they were planted by brothers Dzhokhar, 19, and Tamerlan 
Tsarnaev, 26. After their images were released by the FBI, Tamerlan was 
killed in an ensuing gunfight with police.

His
younger brother was found hiding in a boat outside a home hours later 
and was treated in hospital for an apparently self-inflicted gunshot 
wound to the neck. He remains in federal prison in Massachusetts and is 
charged with using a weapon of mass destruction.

Outpouring: The ground in Boston's Copley Square is covered wtih flowers, candles, teddy bears and messages, while many mourners have tied running shoes to railings at the square in tribute to the victims of the marathon bombings
