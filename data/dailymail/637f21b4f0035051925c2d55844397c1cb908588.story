As the son of a powerful Chinese family, he was expected to act with decorum and meet the highest standards.

But Bo Guagua, 24 - now in hiding 
after his parents were engulfed in scandal over the death of a British 
businessman - gained a reputation as a playboy, cashing in on his 
extraordinary wealth while studying at Oxford.

He has not been seen in public since 
his mother Gu Kailai was named as a suspect in the murder of Old 
Harrovian expat Neil Heywood, prompting her politician husband’s 
suspension from China’s ruling Communist Party.

But new details have emerged about the
 lavish lifestyle enjoyed by the Oxford student, who was renowned for 
hosting champagne and shisha parties in his room at Balliol College, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics.

It is understood that his performance fell short of what was expected and he 
was made to sit ‘penal’ exams.

But in an extraordinary twist – and in
 an astonishing example the influence of his parents before their 
spectacular fall from grace – Chinese officials tried to intervene to 
prevent tutors from disciplining him over his lack of work, it is understood.

‘An official turned up with a couple 
of men in suits. They said it was very embarrassing because education 
was highly valued in China, and it was embarrassing to his father and 
grandfather.

‘His tutors replied if that was the case they should get him to work harder’, a college source told the Telegraph.

A source at the college told MailOnline: 'Of course, it did not affect how the college behaved.

'The college treated him like any other student. And indeed, where there were concerns, there was action taken.'

This visit did not prevent the college
 suspending him for a year shortly after. He moved into a flat, which, 
according to a student newspaper, included ‘taps of gold, a concierge 
and a small 
vineyard’.

Despite the apparent lack of dedication, Mr Bo graduated with a 2:1, but his peers have told how tutors would not hide their contempt for him.

Mr Bo was remembered by friends to be 
ambitious to climb the ranks within the Oxford Union. Friends said ‘he 
never held back on spending’, according to the Telegraph, constantly 
offering to buy people drinks.

In one case, his attempt to become the
 union’s librarian, or vice presidents, saw a large contingent of 
Chinese students arrive to vote for Mr Bo.

But his election bid failed 
when many of his supporters were told they were not eligible to cast a 
ballot because they had only registered the previous day.

He was also said to have arranged a 
lecture at the college by movie star Jackie Chan and organised a ball 
where BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood performed.

Mr Bo refused to comments on events surrounding his family when contacted by reporters.

His mother could face execution if 
convicted of the 41-year-old’s murder, and her husband Bo Xilai has been
 placed under house arrest.

Mr Heywood’s Chinese widow Wang Lulu 
spoke of her heartbreak over the death for the first time yesterday, 
telling the Daily Mail: ‘I am so sad.’

Chinese authorities revealed on 
Tuesday that Mrs Gu was a suspect in Mr Heywood’s death and said she and
 her son Bo Guagua had enjoyed a good relationship with the business 
consultant until a ‘conflict over economic interests’.

The announcement prompted shockwaves 
in China, where Guagua’s father Mr Bo – himself the son of a Communist 
Party figure of the Mao era – was a party leader in the city of 
Chongqing and expected to rise to a senior position within the national 
leadership.

Guagua, who also attended Harrow, had previously faced 
criticism after photographs appeared on social networking sites 
including Facebook and Twitter, showing him daubed with lipstick and 
partying with girls at Oxford University.

The pictures caused embarrassment for 
his family in China and raised questions about how a Communist 
politician could afford to send his son to one of Britain’s most 
prestigious private schools.

Mr Heywood first entered Mr Bo’s orbit when the family determined Guagua should go to Harrow.

He acted as a mentor to the boy, who 
was then educated in Britain from the age of 12, attending Papplewick 
School in Ascot, Berkshire, before he was accepted at Harrow.

His family insisted he had won scholarships to attend Harrow and Oxford.

However, he was eventually suspended for a year, and contemporaries noted the Ferrari-driving student had a ‘strained relationship with books’.

His privileged background made him a so-called princeling in China’s ‘red aristocracy’ and gave him a celebrity status.

A brief relationship with Chen 
Xiaodan, the grand-daughter of one of China’s top bankers, was followed 
with such avid interest that the young couple were given a police escort
 during a holiday in Tibet.

He is now said to be in the U.S., where he is studying at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.

His studies end next month and it is thought he may apply for asylum in the U.S.

Last
 month, after his father was sacked as a party leader in Chongqing, he 
told The Times: ‘My personal desire is to focus on my studies and be 
left out of the political intrigues.’ Guagua has shut down his accounts 
on Facebook and the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and China’s censors 
have stopped internet searches on his name.

Bo Guagua was sent to the famous Harrow School where he was mentored by Neil Heywood

Meanwhile in Beijing Mr Heywood’s widow Wang Lulu spoke briefly of her grief.

His body was discovered in a hotel room last November. Chinese authorities initially blamed the death on excess alcohol, but there is speculation he was poisoned.

At her family’s home in an exclusive gated compound, Mrs Heywood said: ‘I am so sorry. I am so sad.’

Mr Heywood was reported to have applied for a British passport for his wife in the months before his death. Their children Olivia, 11, and Peter, seven, already have British citizenship.

He also told friends he had handed over documents to a British lawyer, detailing the overseas investments of the Bo family, as an ‘insurance policy’, the Wall Street Journal reported.
