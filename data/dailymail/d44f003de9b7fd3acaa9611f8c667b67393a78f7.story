Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, has warned of a 'crisis' in the teaching profession 

Almost half of new teachers leave the profession in their first year because of an excessive workload and 'exhausted and stressed colleagues', a union leader has warned.

The number has tripled in six years, according to an analysis of figures by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL).

The most recent statistics show that in 2011, around 10,800 newly-qualified teachers did not take up a teaching post – up from 3,600 in 2005. 

Around 40 per cent of newly-qualified teachers were not in the classroom after a year in 2011 – compared to 20 per cent in 2005.

The latest figures have sparked fears of  a 'crisis' in the profession.

Mary Bousted, the ATL’s general secretary, told the union’s annual conference in Liverpool yesterday that an increased workload and bureaucracy had made teaching an unappealing profession.

She spoke of a ‘crisis of teacher supply’ because trainee teachers are put off during work placements by the prospect of heavy workloads, excessive monitoring and poor pay.

She added that would-be teachers are meeting more experienced teachers who tell them 'this is no career to enter'.

Miss Bousted described teaching as being ‘incompatible with a normal life’ because it is ‘monitored to within an inch of its life’ due to the demands of heads keen to impress Ofsted inspectors. 

Dr Bousted told delegates that former education secretary Michael Gove said before he entered office that teachers should be highly valued and he wanted to give the profession more freedom over how to teach.

'If that was Michael Gove's intention, and I am sure that was his honest intention, how is it at the end of the coalition's term in office that not only are record numbers of teachers leaving the profession mid-career, but there is also a crisis of teacher supply?' she said.

'This crisis is happening right at the very start of teachers' careers. Teachers are leaving in their first year, or not starting teaching when they have completed their training.;

She added: 'Why are we losing the next generation of teachers - that new blood for the profession which should be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, full of promise and ambition?

'Is it, I wonder, because trainee and newly-qualified teachers see very early on just what teaching has become and decide that they do not want to be a part of it?

She said trainee teachers are put off during work placements by the prospect of heavy workloads, excessive monitoring and poor pay (posed by model)

'Is it that they learn as they work with exhausted and stressed colleagues that teaching has become a profession which is incompatible with a normal life?

'Trainee and newly-qualified teachers cannot fail to understand that, despite Michael Gove's intentions, teaching has become a profession monitored to within an inch of its life.'

Dr Bousted added: 'Seeing what teaching has become, and what the prospect of a career in teaching holds for them, is it in any way surprising that trainee and newly-qualified teachers make the decision to make use of their talents and abilities in a different profession?

'It is sad - but true - that students and NQTs are being told by the teachers they meet during training that with current workload, inspection and pay, this is no career to enter. It didn't have to be like this.'
