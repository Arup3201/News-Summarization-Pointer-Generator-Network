The United Nations has discovered a mass grave containing about 75 bodies in South Sudan which it says is evidence of the wave of ethnic killings taking place in the world's newest country over the last week.

The discovery came before the UN Security Council voted to increase its peacekeeping force in the war-torn country from 7,000 to 12,500 troops - a near 80 per cent increase. It estimates that thousands of people have been killed in over a week of violence in the country.

The top UN humanitarian chief in the 
country Toby Lanzer said there was 'absolutely no doubt in my mind that 
we're into the thousands' of dead, the first clear indication of the 
scale of conflict and ethnic violence engulfing the world's youngest 
nation.

Overwhelmed: At least 20,000 people are sheltering at two UN bases in the capital Juba, while 17,000 are taking refuge in the UN base in the rebel-held town of Bor

Word of the mass grave came as South 
Sudan undertook military operations to wrest back control of the city of
 Bor from rebels loyal to the country's former vice president.

The UN said at least 45,000 civilians 
have sought protection at its badly overstretched bases amid brutal 
fighting that has spread to half of the nation's ten states.

At least 20,000 people are 
sheltering at two UN bases in the capital Juba, while 17,000 are 
sheltering in the UN base in the rebel-held town of Bor which the military said has been raided by armed militia

A further 7,000 people are 
sheltering at the UN base in Bentiu, state capital of the oil-producing 
Unity state - also in rebel hands - the UN added, while 'sporadic 
fighting' has been reported in Upper Nile, another oil-rich state.

'The
 estimated number of people displaced in the current crisis in South 
Sudan has risen to 81,000,' the UN Office for the Co-ordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest situation report.

'Given the limited access to civilians outside population centres, the number is likely to be significantly higher.'

The mass grave was found in Bentiu, said U.N.'s human rights chief Navi Pillay.

Meanwhile, the UN Security Council 
today voted to temporarily increase its peacekeeping force in South 
Sudan to 12,500 troops from 7,000 - nearly an 80 per cent increase.

The
 resolution adopted unanimously by the U.N.'s most powerful body will 
also increase the U.N.'s international police contingent from 900 to 
1,323.

To reach the new
 levels, the council authorised the temporary transfer of troops, police
 and equipment from U.N. missions in Congo, Darfur, Abyei, Ivory Coast 
and Liberia. The U.N. also wants attack helicopters for South Sudan.

The
 council condemned the fighting and violence against civilians and 
ethnic communities that have caused hundreds of deaths across South 
Sudan, and reported human rights violations by all parties.

It called for â€˜an immediate cessation of hostilities and the immediate opening of a dialogueâ€™.

At least two other mass graves are reported to have been found in Juba, she said in a statement Tuesday.

The
 bodies in Bentiu reportedly belonged to the ethnic Dinka, who were 
members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, said Ravina Shamdasani, a
 spokeswoman for the Geneva-based human rights office.

Responding
 to the discovery, the government minister of information Michael Makuei
 Lueth said: 'Of course Bentiu is under the control of the rebel leader 
Riek Machar, so we have nothing to do with that area.'

The United States and Ethiopia are leading efforts to open peace talks on the 10-day-old crisis.

Officials
 say President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar have 
agreed to meet but specifics including the status of Machar's imprisoned
 compatriots are holding up talks.

South
 Sudanese troops are advancing on Bor in order to take it back from 
troops loyal to Machar, said military spokesman Colonel Philip Aguer.

Troops will also soon advance on another rebel-held city, Bentiu, in the oil-rich region of Unity state, he said.

'We have already started in Bor,' Lueth said.

The U.N. has staff in the country investigating the incidents of mass killings, said Pillay. It is unclear who is responsible for the killings, she said.

The other two reported mass graves are in Jebel-Kujur and Newside, near Eden, she said.

The country's top U.N. humanitarian official said Monday that he believes the death toll from 10 days of violence has surpassed 1,000 but that there are no firm counts.

The official, Toby Lanzer, estimated that there are more than 100,000 internal refugees across the country seeking shelter from the violence.
