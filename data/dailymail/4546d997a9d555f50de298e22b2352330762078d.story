Jameson Witty, 18, was charged on Monday with felony grand theft of personal property and two misdemeanors - destroying evidence and resisting, obstructing and delaying a peace officer

Actor Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their Porsche
Carrera GT hit a light pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb
of Santa Clarita.

Prosecutors claim Witty and Janow stole a roof panel from the wrecked
Porsche as it was being towed away.

Witty was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram.

Witty is free on bail and Janow is expected to surrender on Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear whether they had obtained lawyers.

The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed.

The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police.

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft.

A search warrant was executed on Thursday at Rodas’ home, police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof - and arrested him on the spot.

Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intensions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many.

Witty, who faces up to four and half years in jail, has written this apology on his Instagram account

'At the time I was not thinking about the consequences it could have, I never wanted it to be like this I wasn't going to sell the piece to make a profit. Noboy in this world is perfect, we all make mistakes,' he wrote.

'Some bigger than others. My deepest apologies go to Paul's family. And I'm going to say with confidence that I messed up big time, but continue on with life as should you all.'

The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.
