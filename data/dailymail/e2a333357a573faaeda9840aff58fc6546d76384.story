Trial: School teacher Jeremy Forrest is led from a prison van into Lewes Crown Crown, which heard that police halted their probe before he fled to France with a pupil

The teacher accused of abducting a 15-year-old pupil he was having sex with was warned seven times by colleagues that their relationship was inappropriate, a court heard yesterday.

However, none of them reported their concerns about Jeremy Forrest to police.

Staff were even tipped off by concerned pupils about Forrest and the ‘infatuated’ schoolgirl.

The police were eventually alerted when someone outside the school raised concerns.

Police seized the 15-year-old’s mobile phone after being told Forrest, 30, had sent her intimate photographs of himself.

But detectives told senior staff at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, they had not found any evidence on the girl’s phone, and had decided not to examine Forrest’s mobile, Lewes Crown Court heard.

Hours later, they absconded to Bordeaux. Forrest was arrested after eight days on the run.

Police searches then revealed the couple had in fact exchanged topless pictures of each other.

Teachers yesterday told the court how Forrest had repeatedly lied when confronted about his relationship with the girl.

He tearfully accused her of lying as he denied the claims to colleagues, it was alleged.

Staff were even worried about the stress the rumours were causing him, the court heard.

Police began investigating on September 14 last year after the tip-off and took the girl’s phone for analysis five days later.

But Alicja Bobela, the school’s assistant head in charge of child protection, said police called her on September 20, adding: ‘They said there was no evidence on the girl’s phone so they were not going to seize Jeremy’s. We were left with the idea we had to follow up the investigation.’

Evidence: Bishop Bell CofE teachers Alicja Bobela (left), Neil Pittman and Emma Tremaman (right) all told the court how they had spoken to Forrest about his relationship with the student

That evening, fearing their 
relationship was about to be exposed, Forrest drove the girl to Dover 
where they took a ferry to Calais. Forrest was first warned by 
colleagues to keep his distance from the girl after a school trip to Los
Angeles in February 2012.

Emma Tremaman, who taught ICT and 
business, said she spoke to Forrest about rumours that the girl had a 
crush on him and that he showed her favouritism. She told the court: ‘He
just said thank you.’

Neil Pittman, head of the upper school, also spoke to Forrest after two pupils said stories were going around the school.

Teacher in the dock: Jeremy Forrest's 15-year-old pupil, giving evidence by videolink yesterday, has described how their relationship had developed from a kiss in the classroom to sex at the cottage he shared with his wife

The science teacher said: ‘It’s not 
unusual for teenage girls to have a crush on a male teacher, but it is 
unusual for it to be  discussed openly.’

Mr Pittman said Forrest agreed to 
keep his distance from the girl. But Mr Pittman later saw him ‘laughing 
and joking’ with her. Forrest also arranged for her to be taken out of 
exclusion, where she was sent for misbehaviour, so she could attend his 
maths revision lesson, he said.

Mr Pittman said: ‘Potentially, it wasn’t a wise thing to do.’

Miss Bobela said pupils had told her 
in May that Forrest had been sending the girl private Twitter messages 
describing his marriage problems. She called the local authority and 
Forrest, who denied the claims.

After more rumours, the teenager was removed from Forrest’s maths class in mid June.

When another teacher confronted 
Forrest last July about stories that he was picking the girl up in his 
car, he came to speak to Miss Bobela. She told the court: ‘He said, “Why
is she doing this to me?” He seemed tearful.’

Mark Talbot, the school’s deputy 
head, also spoke to Forrest ‘to make sure he was clear about 
professional boundaries’, adding: ‘It was apparent to us that he was not
heeding the advice of Miss Bobela.’

Forrest seemed ‘irritated’ about being questioned, he said. Mr Talbot said he spoke to Forrest again in May.

Forrest denies one count of child abduction. The case continues.
