Andrew Hardy, 48, was caught with £31,000 worth of cannabis growing at his flat in Shrewsbury. When questioned by police, he said he dealt drugs to keep his hometown 'calm'

A drug dealer has been jailed after telling a judge he sold cannabis because he wanted to keep the people in his hometown calm.

Andrew Hardy, 48, had around £31,000 worth of cannabis growing in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. It was discovered by officers after a police raid on October 31 last year.

He told officers he had grown 728.9g of the Class-B drug in his home because he was 'making Shrewsbury calm.'

Prosecutor Kevin Jones said: 'He was frank with the police and said he was "making Shrewsbury calm."

'He said he was regularly dealing £1,300 of cannabis to various people.

'He said he was providing a service to the public and was dealing small quantities almost every day.'

He was jailed for 20 months after he admitted drug dealing at Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday.

Jailing him, Judge Robin Onions said: 'The problem for you is that for years and years you’ve been addicted to cannabis.

'I hope in the future you can find a way of living your life that doesn’t involve breaking the law.'

Judge Onions also made a forfeiture order for the drug growing equipment in Hardy’s flat and ordered the drugs to be destroyed.

Officers from West Mercia Police searched Hardy’s home in Shrewsbury hours after arresting him earlier in the day.

They discovered he was carrying a small amount of cannabis and £290 in cash.

When
 they searched his home they discovered a cannabis bush. The plant had a 
street value of between £19,672.50 and £31,317.50, the court heard.

Shrewsbury Crown Court, pictured, heard Hardy defended his dealing by saying he was providing a public service to the people of the town. He was jailed for 20 months - with a judge ordering the drugs to be destroyed

They also found drugs paraphernalia along with £3,804.07 in cash.

Mike Sherwood-Smith, defending, said: 'He didn’t try to hide anything from the police.

'He had a fairly wide circle of friends, all cannabis users and they all relied on him for their supply.

'He
 didn’t claim any benefits in that time and relied only on his cannabis 
sales of about £125 to £150 a week and some gratis cannabis for what he 
was doing.'
