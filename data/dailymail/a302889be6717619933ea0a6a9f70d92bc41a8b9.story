If being buried in a box underground doesn't appeal to you, but you don't want to be cremated, why not try mummification.

For centuries, ancient Egyptians mummified pharoahs, and later, other nobility, to preserve their bodies and give them safe passage to the afterlife.

The ritual eventually died out, yet a company in Utah has spent the last 30 years working on bringing it back.

More than 1,500 people across the world have contacted Summum, the world’s only mummification company, to be preserved after they die.

And it's not just for humans. The company, based in Salt Lake City, has previously mummified pets for customers worldwide. 

Summum was set up in 1975 by Claude Nowell, who later changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra - or Corky Ra for short.

Dogs, cats, peacocks, finches and even rats have undergone Ra's updated version of the traditional 
Egyptian burial routine.

The Ancient Egyptians mummified 
bodies because they believed in the afterlife.

They believed that by preserving 
the bodies of the pharaohs, these wealthy members of society would stand the best possible chance of living in the
 eternal world.

The process involved washing the dead body as a symbol of purification with wine and water from the River Nile.

The modern-day process takes 90 days. The organs 
are taken out and cleansed, then the body is hydrated for more than 70 
days in a tank full of chemicals.

Summum was set up in 1975 by Claude Nowell, who later changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra - or Corky Ra for short. More than 1,500 people across the world have contacted Summum to enquire about the process for themselves, or their pets, example mummiforms pictured

Summum counsellor Ron Temu is pictured with a mummified cat, left, while Corky Ra is pictured right with his two mummified pets - a dog called Buster who died in 1986 and a cat called Oscar who died in 1985. Both caskets are covered in gold leaf

It is covered with lanolin and wax, followed by layers of cotton 
gauze and a fibre glass finish. The body is then encased in a steel or 
bronze casket.

Summum counsellor Ron Temu told MailOnline: ‘The chemicals we use are so permeable 
that if a drop was put on the hand, just seconds later it can be tasted 
in the mouth.

'The olden day mummies look very dry and that’s because it was believed 
the best way to preserve them for the afterlife was to completely 
dehydrate them.

'We do the opposite and believe that 
hydrating the body 
fully is the best way to preserve it. That's why the bodies will still 
look like the day they died - even thousands of years later.’

Yet
 the process isn’t cheap. Cats start at £3,600 ($6,000), while dogs cost
 around £15,000 ($25,000). Human mummification starts at approximately 
£40,000 ($67,000) but can cost more for 'larger adults.'

To prepare the deceased for mummification, the internal organs are removed, cleansed and placed back into the body. It is immersed in a baptismal font for 70 days. The body is then cleansed again, pictured left, before being wrapped in cotton gauze, right. It is finally covered in polyurethane, fibreglass resin and metal

'As we have clients from all around the world, including the UK, if a 
pet dies, then a vet packs it in ice and it is transported to us 
straight away,’ continued Temu.

Some people do like having their mummified pets in their own homes - even animals as small as a rat or finch.'

‘What is amazing is that these animals, like everything else we mummify, just looks exactly like the day it died. We test some of the pets after they have been mummified for years and they are perfect.’

The
 first mummified humans were created by Summum almost a decade ago, but 
each had to be opened after 18 months to check on their progress and 
state law claims that once opened, the bodies must be incinerated.

The Ancient Egyptians mummified 
bodies because they believed in the afterlife and thought that by preserving 
their bodies, they would stand the best possible chance of living in the
 eternal world.

The process involved washing the dead body as a symbol of purification with wine and water from the River Nile.

An
 incision was then made to remove all of the organs. These 
included the liver, lungs, stomach and intestines but the heart was left
 as it was integral to the life eternal.

These organs were wrapped in linen and reinserted, and the body was then stuffed and covered with salt in order to dry it out for 40 days. It was later cleansed for a second time before being covered with oil to keep the skin elastic.

Summum uses similar techniques, but these have been updated to use more modern materials and processes.

Firstly, the body of the deceased is sent to a local funeral home for traditional funeral services before being sent to Salt Lake City.

The internal organs are removed, cleansed and placed back in the body, It is then immersed in a baptismal font for 70 days.

This tank is filled with a preservation solution made up of chemicals, some of which are used in genetic engineering.

The body is removed from the tank, cleansed again, then covered with a lotion before several layers of cotton gauze are wrapped around it.

A polyurethane membrane is applied over the gauze, forming a permanent seal, followed by a layer of fiberglass and resin.

The body is encased within a bronze or stainless steel mummiform, which is then filled with an amber resin, completely surrounding and protecting the mummy.

The openings in the mummiform are welded closed and it is enshrined within a mummy sanctuary or buried in a local cemetery.

Other humans have signed up to be mummified in the future - and the company said this has tremendous implications for cloning. For example, it is feasible DNA could be removed at a later date by drilling into the casket.

Temu added: ‘Being able to take out DNA at a later date has real 
appeal for people. People like the idea of being able to clone 
themselves.

‘We have a lot of people signed up to be mummified. They signed up in 
their 30's and 40’s, and are now in their 50’s and 60’s, so we have a 
lot of work ahead of us.’
