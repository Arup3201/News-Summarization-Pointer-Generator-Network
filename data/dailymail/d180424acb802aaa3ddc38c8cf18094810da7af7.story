Security measures at airports in the United states and abroad may be enhanced on concerns that terrorists in Syria are building a new generation of bombs to smuggle onto planes.

The issue was discussed last week during a meeting at the White House with top-level officials from intelligence agencies, ABC News cites sources as saying.

The agencies are also debating whether to make a public announcement on potential new security measures at airports after more recent intelligence indicated the 'subset' of extreme terrorists in Syria could be looking to down a U.S. or European-bound plane.

'[This threat] is different and more disturbing than past aviation plots,' one source said.

According to ABC News, the group intends to use one of the thousands of U.S. and European passport holders who have joined the Al Nusrah Front - a particularly extreme group of terrorists in Syria - or other radical groups in the region.Â 

However, the U.S. government doesn't know of a specific target or time frame for an attack.

A source told the network the Syrian subset was working alongside operatives from al Qaeda to produce 'creative' new designs for bombs.

The Yemen-based al Qaeda group was responsible for the 'underwear bomb' that failed to denote in a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.

According to ABC, officials garnered the thread of intelligence earlier this year, and have since been discussing how they could increase security measures to address the threat.

It's not clear what they are planning, however a source told the network teh enhancements could include increasing the rates of random screenings at airports, targeting certain types of travelers, or changes in the security lines.

Representative Peter King, who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, said security at airports overseas was 'a real concern' to U.S. officials because some do not have the type of security they should have.

He said the federal government needs to be 'very aggressive' is responding to the situation.

'I can't go into all the details but that is very important to do...' King said Sunday on ABC News' 'This Week.'
