The customer is always right.

So much so that Waitrose has let a seven-year-old boy redesign its brown sauce label - because it's 'too boring'.

Harry Deverill wrote to the supermarket complaining about the drab design, and included his own suggestion.

Lead designer: Harry Deverill with his own design to improve Waitrose's 'boring' brown sauce label

To his surprise, executives wrote back a few weeks later agreeing to take him up on the offer.

Now, Harry's label - which features a hand-drawn picture of a full English breakfast - has gone on sale nationwide.

His mother Helen Deverill, 38, said it was her father that encouraged Harry to get in touch with the supermarket.

But family in Wimborne, Dorset, never expected to get a response.

The mother-of-two said: 'Harry wrote in his letter that he didn't really know what was on the bottle, he said his mummy thought he was really good at drawing and he'd happily draw them a new label if they wanted. 

Surprise: He wrote a letter to Waitrose managing director Mark Price and was astounded to receive a reply

'A few weeks later he received a letter back thanking him for his comments and agreeing to take him up on his offer to design a new label. 

'We didn't really expect Harry to get a response I think his dad and I were more shocked than Harry.

'Harry was really surprised and really excited as he was only six at the time, he spent almost a week perfecting his design, he drew three suggestions one with a picture of a bacon sandwich another with a picture of fried eggs on toast and another with a fried breakfast.

Dear Mark Price,

I am writing as the other morning I had Waitrose essential Brown Sauce with my bacon sandwiches. I asked Daddy what the picture is of o the label. Daddy didn't know and neither do I. Please could you let me know. Mummy says I am good at drawing so if you would like me to draw a new picture for the label I would be happy to.

Kind regards, Harry Deverill, aged 6.

'Now the label is on the shelf it looks great and I think Waitrose have really done themselves proud it proves they listen to their customers no matter how young they are.'

Harry is not the only one to take the supermarkets to task - and come out victorious.

In 2012, three-year-old Lily Robinson pointed out that so-called 'tiger bread' bears no resemblance to tigers, but rather resembles a giraffe.

Astoundingly, she received a reply to her suggestion two weeks later from customer manager Chris King who wrote: ‘I think renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a brilliant idea.

‘It looks much more like the blotches on a giraffe than the stripes on a tiger, doesn’t it?’

The firm has now adopted the name permanently. 

Harry said: 'I love brown sauce, but I didn't know what the picture on the front of the bottle was.

'I love eating eggs and bacon with brown sauce, so I thought I'd draw a new version.

'I'm so excited that my picture is on bottles in lots of Waitrose shops.'

Confidence: His mother said the reply boosted Harry's confidence in his drawing skills and his own opinions

Jo Heywood, Waitrose sauces buyer, said: 'When we heard Harry's offer and read his letter, we couldn't resist. We love our customers to tell us what they think of products, and when they're as creative as Harry, it's a pleasure to be able to do something fun like this.

'The drawing Harry created was perfect, and we're so excited for our customers to pick up an original Harry Deverill print on a bottle of brown sauce.'

The special edition Harry-designed bottles will be in the majority of Waitrose shops among the regular essential Waitrose brown sauce (£1.20) for a limited time.
