There were tears today as villagers finally lost their battle to save a century-old tree at the heart of their community.

Despite a two-week occupation by five protesters, coming at the end of a £300,000 five-year legal case, the Irton beech is no more.

Contractors with chainsaws began felling the magnificent 55ft tree in the centre of the North Yorkshire village.

Protected by metal barricades and five police officers, workmen lopped off its branches as the fifth and final eco-warrior climbed down in tears.

After four nights in the tree Vikki Welsh, 17, stood sobbing behind the barriers as the chainsaws and clunking machinery drowned out the residents’ last protests.

The teenager, from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, said: ‘I feel very emotional. The worst moment was coming down. I am absolutely distraught that more than a quarter of a million pounds has been spent and the tree has still not been saved.’

She and local residents wept, hugged each other and jeered as workmen moved in to take down the tree. Ann Wootton, 62, who has lived in the village 22 years, said: ‘It is the last thing I wanted to see. It’s horrendous. I can’t watch this. It is so very, very wrong.

‘The tree represented England at its best and they are just desecrating and destroying it.

‘This is a symbol of a rotting Britain and a desecration of everything we used to hold dear in this country –  village life and the environment.’

Mark Snow, 39, who was the first to climb the tree a fortnight ago to  prevent its felling, said he was ‘absolutely appalled’.

‘It is terrible news,’ the carpenter said today. ‘A friend and I were offered the job of turning the stump into a bench but we wouldn’t touch it.’ 

Mr Snow – dubbed the Scarborough Swampy – climbed the tree an hour before workmen were due to begin cutting it down a fortnight ago.

When he left he was replaced by another protester, and so on, until this morning when Miss Welsh descended the tree.

It brought to a close a dispute that began in 2006 when Gerald and Norah Hazelwood moved into their £345,000 home on Irton’s Main Street.

They said the tree, which stands by the gates to their detached home, was damaging their drive and limestone front wall and causing the drains to block.

But their opponents called the felling ‘wanton destruction’ for the  convenience of only two people, and asked why they had bought the house when they knew a huge tree was right outside the front gates.

A total of 200 locals in Irton, which has just 150 houses, signed a petition calling for the beech tree not to be cut down and were backed by the parish council and officials at Scarborough Borough Council.

They issued a Tree Preservation 
Order, saying the loss of the beech would result in ‘serious harm to the
character of the village’.

Because the tree is on a public grass verge it falls under the ownership of North Yorkshire County Council.

Despite
spending £300,000 in legal fees to save the tree, the council was 
eventually forced to comply with a judge’s order to remove it. Taxpayers will have to pay at least £100,000 of the fees.

Scarborough’s
Tory MP, Robert Goodwill, said: ‘The only people to come out of this 
smiling will be the lawyers who have pocketed some very fat cheques.’

He said the trunk would be retained as a bench and turned into ‘the world’s most expensive village seat’.

Parish
council vice chairman David Parker said: ‘We did not want to give up, 
but had to because of the financial cost. We are just a group of  
elderly villagers with very little clout other than what we believe in.’
