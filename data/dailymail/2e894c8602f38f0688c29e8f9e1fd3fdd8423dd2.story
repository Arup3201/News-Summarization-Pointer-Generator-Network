After attending 132 Bruce Springsteen shows, New Jersey governor Chris Christie has finally had some recognition from his musical idol.

For many years, Christie's love for the singer was unrequited but, as he explained on The Daily Show yesterday, he recently got to grips with his hero.

During NBC's fundraising concert for victims of superstorm Sandy last week Governor Christie got a hug from The Boss, and he told host Jon Stewart that he tried to be 'cool' but wasn't.

Christie is a Springsteen fanatic. But despite his best efforts, the liberal musician has long ignored the Republican politician. Springsteen campaigned for President Obama during last month's elections.

Yet at NBC's telethon last Friday, the two New Jersey natives met backstage, and hugged it out.

Christie and Daily Show host Stewart, also from New Jersey, are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. But they agreed on two things on last night's show.

Firstly that agreed they 'can't wait, and know, that the great state of New Jersey will bounce back stronger than ever' from the devastation wrought by Sandy. Secondly, both men 'would very much like' Bruce Springsteen to hug them.

Christie then told of his experience last Friday. He turned around backstage to find Springsteen standing behind him, offering a handshake.

The governor accepted, then the singer said 'Come on, give me a hug.'

Stewart inquired into Christie's hugging technique, asking if he also gave the singer a pat on the back during the embrace. Christie confirmed that there was no patting involved - the hug was 'slow dance' style.

According to Christie, Springsteen then said: 'It's official. We're friends.'

Stewart moved on to ask Christie about relief efforts in New Jersey, pointing out the irony of the governor bashing President Obama's leadership before the storm, then praising Obama fulsomely after the disaster.

'It tells me people have different skill sets at different times,' Christie said.

When a picture was taken of Christie with his eyes shut at a Springsteen concert in April, it was claimed that governor had fallen asleep.

Instead Christie claimed that he was merely closing his eyes to better enjoy Rocky Road, a song he describes as 'spiritual.'

At the time he stated: 'I have never fallen asleep at a Bruce Springsteen show, I will never fall asleep during a Bruce Springsteen show, my wife is probably afraid that I'm more likely to die during a Bruce Springsteen show than fall asleep.'
