Oxford University bursar Jean Wright was fired after she said former BBC boss was running the college 'for the kudos on his CV'

 

An Oxford University bursar was sacked after she complained her college was run by former BBC executive Mark Damazer ‘for the kudos on his CV’, she claimed yesterday.

Jean Wright, 60, told colleagues the former Radio 4 controller had become a college master at Oxford as ‘a stepping stone to a higher position within the university’.

Mr Damazer left a 25-year career at the BBC to become master at St Peter’s College in 2010, and Mrs Wright said she was fired three years later, allegedly following a ‘witch hunt’ to get rid of her.

She claims she was the victim of unfair dismissal and disability discrimination, and her employment tribunal against St Peter’s has been told there was a culture of racism, sexism and prejudice at the college.

But Mr Damazer, 59, pictured, has denied her ‘spurious’ allegations and accused the former bursar of deliberately seeking to damage both him and the college.

Mr Damazer said a string of employees had complained about Mrs Wright being ‘aggressive, hostile, threatening and abusive’ and some had threatened to leave because of her behaviour.

Mrs Wright claimed staff at the college, whose former students include Bank of England governor Mark Carney and TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, turned against her after she accused a volunteer archivist, Geoffrey Fouquet, of bullying.

She said: ‘I wouldn’t want anybody to be treated like that, it was absolutely dreadful. When I asked Mark Damazer how he intended to protect me, he told me that if the matter had to go to tribunal then so be it. I was taken aback and very upset.’

Mrs Wright described numerous other problems with Mr Fouquet, including one incident in September 2011 when he was alleged to have said to a cleaner: 'I do like to see a woman on her knees.'

Despite numerous complaints and an investigation, Mr Fouquet was allowed to continue working at the college.

Mrs Wright said: 'I felt that the college did not take my complaints seriously, did not properly investigate them, and did not understand the distress that I had suffered.'

When Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010, Mrs Wright met with him to express her concerns about Mr Fouquet.

'He did not appear to me to be sympathetic during the meeting and no resolution to the problems of bullying towards me was offered,' said Mrs Wright.

College Master Mark Damazer CBE, (pictured left outside the hearing in Reading, Berks) was controller of BBC Radio 4 and BBC 7 before he took up the role. Jean Wright (pictured right) told the tribunal there had been a conspiracy to oust her from her role.

She added that Mr Damazer did not reply to emails in which she complained about bullying from Mr Fouquet and told him she was depressed.

On June 27, 2012, Mrs Wright was told Mr Fouquet would be retiring at the end of the year but would still be allowed to come to the college.

'When I asked Mark Damazer how he intended to protect me from future bullying and harassment from Geoffrey Fouquet, he told me that I would have to follow the due process of the law by reporting the incidents, and if the matter had to go to tribunal then so be it,' said Mrs Wright. 'I was taken aback and very upset.'  

In July 2012 a further investigation took place into claims Mr Fouquet bullied and harassed Mrs Wright, but her complaint was not upheld.

Early in 2013, Mrs Wright was told a number of allegations had been made against her, including about how she handled an investigation which led to maintenance engineer Roger Hall being sacked.

Mr Hall was accused of making offensive comments, including describing a woman called Ruby as 'a black cow'. The decision to sack Mr Hall was overturned on appeal.

Mrs Wright said she believed the allegations had been raised because fellows who were friends with Mr Fouquet wanted to get rid of her.

'I felt like I was on the receiving end of a witch hunt and that the college was scraping the bottom of a barrel,' said Mrs Wright.

She added that she was 'appalled and upset' by an allegation she had made a terminally-ill employee feel like they could not request time off.

Following disciplinary proceedings, Mrs Wright was fired on November 8, 2013.

Among the five allegations upheld against Mrs Wright were that she said about Mr Damazer: 'He's here for the kudos on his CV - he will be off soon. This is a stepping stone to a higher position within the university as I have been told he is very ambitious.'

It was ruled these comments made staff feel 'vulnerable'.

Other reasons for her dismissal were the way she handled the Mr Hall investigation, claims she accused a housekeeper of lying about being ill and a suggestion she was 'aggressive, hectoring and frightening' during a staff meeting.

Mrs Wright said: 'Some had complained about me in circumstances where I had identified issues with their performance and it had been made clear that the Master was receptive to complaints.

'I believe that Geoffrey Fouquet's friends were involved in orchestrating, or encouraging, those complaints.

'The college maintain that it would have been impossible for me to return to work because of the breakdown in relations with my staff.

'I believe that after 17 years of effectively managing the staff the college put me in an impossible situation and then chose to dismiss me.'

Mr Damazer has denied there was any conspiracy to oust Mrs Wright as a result of the Fouquet allegations.

He previously told the tribunal: 'The claimant has sought to make spurious allegations about matters which do not pertain to her dismissal in order to cause damage to the college and to myself. These allegations are untrue and without foundation.

'While I was not directly involved in the decision making process I believe that the claimant was shown on the evidence to have acted in a way which was not only reprehensible in itself but an abuse of power in respect of her subordinates.'

Other staff have described Mrs Wright as a 'bully', saying she once stopped colleagues from buying someone a leaving card and flowers.

The tribunal continues.
