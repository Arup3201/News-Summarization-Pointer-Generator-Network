Watching Lancôme's latest fragrance advert, it is impossible to believe that Julia Roberts is nearing her half century.

The 44-year-old actress positively glows in the latest offering for the brand, for which she is an ambassador.

Directed by Mirror Mirror director Tarsem Singh, Julia glides through a crowded party as a bottle of Lancôme's latest fragrance, 'La Vie Est Belle', glimmers under the chandelier lights.

Julia Roberts looks far younger than her 44 years in the new Lancome fragrance advert

Roberts has been an ambassador for Lancôme since 2010 but this is her first fragrance campaign with the French beauty company.

A campaign she did for the brand last year was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, who deemed L'Oreal, parent company of Lancome, had used digitally retouched images that could 'mislead' the viewer.

L’Oreal said at the time that image had been digitally re-touched to ‘lighten the skin, clean up make-up, reduce dark shadows and shading around the eyes, smooth the lips and darken the eyebrows’. However, again, it insisted that the image was an accurate reflection of the benefits of the product.

The ASA was not convinced, ruling the images could not be used again in their current form.

Here though, it cannot be denied that Julia Roberts is in possession of a striking natural beauty.

Dressed in a floor length white dress that reveals her ample cleavage, the star shines in her role.

'The only person that could embody this
kind of joyful femininity, this woman that could be all women at the 
same time - in their honesty, truth and diversity - is Julia Roberts,' 
Youcef Nabi, president of Lancôme International, told WWD.

The
perfume itself is made of just 63 subtle ingredients and was the 
creation of three French masters of perfumery; Olivier Polge, Dominique 
Ropion and Anne Flipo, who aimed to create 'the first ever feminine 
iris'.

The perfume has fruity flavour notes of blackcurrant and pear, with tones of tonka bean, praline, patchouli and vanilla.

The Pretty Woman actress told Hello! magazine that it's important for her to wear a nice scent as it makes her feel more confident with herself.

'I like to smell nice. And I think it is best when perfume is kind of there, but still draws people in. You have to get close to figure out what you're dealing with.

The Advertising Standards Agency banned this Lancome advert of actress Julia Roberts after complaints it was misleading

'The bottle is beautiful. And in this day and age when everything's about the brand and everything's got the name of the company and the person and the place stamped all over it, what I think is amazing is that there's nothing written on the bottle,' she said.
