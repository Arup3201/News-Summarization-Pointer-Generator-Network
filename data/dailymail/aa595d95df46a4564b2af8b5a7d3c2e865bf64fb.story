The summer transfer window wouldn't be the summer transfer window without Real Madrid flexing their financial muscle.

Last year they broke the world transfer record to sign Gareth Bale from Tottenham for £85.3million.

Fast forward 12 months and more global stars are joining.

They have signed World Cup winner Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for £24m and are trying to complete a £63m deal for world football's new kid on the block James Rodriguez.

Welcome to the European champions: Carlo Ancelotti shakes hands with Toni Kroos

No 1 target: Real are looking to tie up a deal for James Rodriguez now Kroos has arrived

Once Rodriguez is secured, his compatriot and Monaco team-mate Radamel Falcao is expected to follow.

As if their Champions League winning squad wasn't strong enough already.

But just how will Carlo Ancelotti pick his strongest starting XI next season with so much world class talent at his disposal?

Here, Sportsmail has a stab at doing the Italian's job for him.

Not bad, huh?

Even with Barcelona's front line of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, Ancelotti's new look side has the potential to go all the way domestically and Europe again next season.

For £20m, Kroos is perhaps the most value for money signing of the summer, his displays in Brazil are testament to that.

The midfielder is the heir to Xabi Alonso's central midfield throne, though the Spain maestro can still expect ample playing time next season.

And if Real's move for Monaco star Rodriguez comes off, then their front four will be one of the most feared on the continent.

His displays in the No 10 role for a Colombia were a highlight of the World Cup. And who knows how far the Colombians would have gone if their main goal-poacher Falcao were fit. 

So to combine that with the attacking prowess of Cristano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale then you've only one outcome: goals.

And if for whatever reason that starting XI doesn't work out then Ancelotti needn't worry too much.

To replace Diego Lopez in goal read Iker Casillas, to step in for Sergio Ramos or Pepe in central defence you have Raphael Varane, if the central midfield isn't quite working perhaps Alonso, Isco or Sami Khedira could do a better job, and there's always Karim Benzema to step in up front.

It's a tough life being Ancelotti.
