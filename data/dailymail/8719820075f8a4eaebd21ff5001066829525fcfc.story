Two fly tippers were caught on CCTV as they dumped rubbish out of their truck while driving through a seaside town. 

Footage shows the flat-bed truck leaving behind a trail of waste as it passes in front of a row of homes in Blackpool, Lancashire.

Drivers Rick Taylor, 40, and Daniel Ashworth, 22, opened the tail gate on their Ford Transit and used hydraulics to tilt the bed - scattering their load on the road while still travelling at 30mph.

Taylor and Ashworth admitted to a string of offences including carrying, handling and depositing illegal waste at Blackpool Magistrates' Court yesterday.

Victoria Cartmell, prosecuting for Blackpool Council, said waste dumped from the vehicle included asbestos which was left near two schools.

She said: 'Waste has been collected illegally around the area. Some of it was hazardous.'

'The prosecution say that these two men were involved in a joint enterprise.They collected waste cheaper than it would cost to dispose of it legally. Therefore to make a profit it had to be dumped illegally.'

After the hearing a spokesman for Keep Britain Tidy said: 'This sort of behaviour is symptomatic of wider social decay. Cleaning up litter costs the ratepayer £1 billion a year.'
