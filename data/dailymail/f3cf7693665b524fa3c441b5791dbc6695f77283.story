As she approached her 60th birthday, there was only one present Linda Briggs wanted - new breasts.

The 59-year-old from Norfolk was determined to wear a backless, silk dress as she celebrated her milestone birthday, and all that stood in her way was her 'saggy' cleavage.

So rather than consign the dress to her wardrobe, Linda instead booked to have a boob job in Paris.

Forking out to look younger: Linda Briggs has spent more than £50,000 to roll back the years

Transformed: Linda, left, aged 44 when she was mistaken for her sister's mother, and right, after more than 50 procedures including a boob job 

It's not the first time she's been under the knife. In fact she's had more than 50 procedures in the past 15 years, spending over £50,000 in the process.

She said: 'I don't want to look old and I will do whatever is necessary to stop the process.'

As a result of her quest to roll back the years, she has had procedures including upper and lower eye lid reduction, a face lift, a neck lift, eye bag removal, liposuction on her stomach and thighs and even had her toe straightened.

The former lawyer reveals on Channel 5 documentary '200 Nips & Tucks and I Want More!' that cosmetic surgery has become the 'norm' for her. 

She said: 'I wouldn't say I'm addicted to surgery but if I have an issue I will have it corrected.'

She added: 'I know what can be achieved with cosmetic surgery so I am less tolerant of any problems that I have. If it's easy to go and do it, I'll go and do it and get rid of it.' 

Linda revealed that her obsession with surgery began aged 44 when she was mistaken for her younger sister's mother at her wedding.

Quick fix: Linda says she's not addicted to surgery but is happy to go under the knife if necessary when she spots something she wants to change

She explains: 'A friend of hers came up to me and asked if I was her mother. I didn't react at the time although I wanted to kill her! It was like a stab in the back, I was shocked I never thought I looked that old. 

'I got back and looked in the mirror and thought "why would she think I'm my sister's mother?"

'I studied my face and thought "you've got a turkey neck and lines like the grand canyon". I screamed and cried, then thought "now's the time for a face lift".'

Since then she has had dozens of procedures to help her look younger and slimmer.

She said she isn't worried about an operation going disastrously wrong and doesn't think she will even look unnatural as a result of playing with nature.

Uplifting: The former lawyer went to Paris to have a boob job ahead of her 60th birthday

Ta dah! Linda back in her favourite dress which she couldn't wear when she had 'saggy' boobs

She said: 'I don't think you can tell I have had surgery as I do try and keep it as natural as possible. I will never grow old gracefully. I will grow old as disgracefully as I possibly can.' 

She added: 'I am blasé about it. Once I have made the decision I am going it, I do research right surgery and surgeon.' 

Most recently she had a breast lift so she could have the cleavage of a woman half her age on her 60th birthday.

She was delighted with the result which she showed off in her favourite black dress.  

'I haven't worn this for years as my breasts have been saggy and you can't wear it with a bra, now it looks great. All of me I think looks 45 but the boobs look like a 30 year olds.'

She added: 'I think my friends and family will think I'm a tart but I don't care!'

200 Nips & Tucks and I Want More! is on Channel 5 this evening at 11pm or catch up with Demand 5
