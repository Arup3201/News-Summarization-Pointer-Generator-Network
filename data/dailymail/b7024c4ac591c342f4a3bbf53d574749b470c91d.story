Alexandra Traycoff has been a heart patient at Indiana’s Riley Hospital for Children and its outpatient center since she was just a few months old and says it’s through the generosity of others that she’s alive today.

So when the 24-year-old saw an Indianapolis news story about Katelyn Newell, the 8-year-old Terre Haute girl waiting for a heart transplant, she says she could relate to her struggle.

But she also noticed that Katelyn, like her, was a big Justin Bieber fan as well.

Bieber surprise: Alexandra Traycoff, 24, poses for a photo with 8-year-old Katelynn Newell on Tuesday after surprising her in her hospital room with two tickets to see Justin Bieber

So Ms Traycoff, who had an extra set of tickets to the young singer’s July 10 concert at Banker's Life Fieldhouse, decided to give them to Katelyn, who has been in Riley's Heart Center for more than 10 weeks, in an emotional surprise.

On late Tuesday morning, Ms Traycoff, her mom, Lori, and dad, Sergei, made a surprise visit to Katelyn in her hospital room to present her with the two tickets hidden inside a plastic Justin Bieber bag.

Just about everyone else knew about the 'surprise,' including the WRTV 6 news crew doing a follow-up story. Ms Traycoff had contacted TV reporter Tanya Spencer soon after she saw the story about Katelyn. That paved the way for Tuesday.

As the big moment approached, several Riley staff waited in the hall, eagerly awaiting Katelyn's reaction, and Katelyn's mom, Robin, had her iPhone ready to take video and pictures.

Strangers; Katelyn didn't know Alexandria Traycoff before Tuesday morning when the 24-year-old came into her hospital room with the purple Justin Bieber bag, seen

Overwhelming: Alexandria smiles after Katelynn discovered the two tickets hidden inside a Justin Bieber gift bag, before becoming overwhelmed and hiding, keeping both tickets in hand

Once news crews and Ms Traycoff and her parents arrived in Katelyn's room, she presented Katelyn with the gift bag. Katelyn, who sat in a red Riley wagon — her back to the crowd — found a Bieber book and Bieber tattoos — but for a short period, the big gift was missing in action.

Finally, she dug it out from beneath piles of tissue paper.

'Do you know what those are?' Katelyn’s mother Robin Newell asked her.

'Tickets,' said Katelyn.

'To?' her mom nudged.

'A concert,' Katelyn said.

'Who are you going to go see?'

At that point, the 8-year-old became just a little overwhelmed by all the excitement.

Thankful: Katelyn's mother Robin Newell, right, was overcome with emotion from so many people, total strangers, that have reached out to help her daughter in the smallest ways in their time of trouble

'This is your surprise, Katelyn. You get to go see Justin, in concert,' her mother said. The crowd burst into applause.

Katelyn had known for a while about a surprise — but she never imagined tickets to his concert.

Ms Traycoff told the Tribune-Star that initially, her family had planned to sell the extra tickets after mistakenly buying two more than needed, but when she saw the story about Katelyn, she knew, 'That's where I wanted to give them.'

Ms Traycoff, who was born with a congenital heart defect, feels a strong connection to Katelyn.

'That's the link to this story that makes it very, very sweet,' said Lori Traycoff, Alexandra's mom. Her daughter has had three surgeries at Riley Hospital and now goes to the Riley outpatient center.

Lori Traycoff said the tickets are 'hope for the future — something for Katelyn to look forward to' as she awaits a heart transplant.

But Ms Traycoff has other plans up her sleeve.

Much in common: Katelynn playfully hides behind a Justin Bieber cardboard inside her hospital room beside Alexandra Traycoff, left, with both able to relate to not only a love of Justin Bieber but needing a heart transplant

She's working through social media and other means to try and arrange a meeting between Bieber and Katelyn.

She's emailed Ellen DeGeneres, who is friends with Bieber, and she's also tweeting Bieber (but hasn't heard back).

Before the Traycoffs left, Ms Traycoff spent time talking to Katelyn and she hopes to come back and visit.

Lori Traycoff shared with Katelyn and Robin what had happened earlier in the day. The family had planned to bring a balloon bouquet, but then learned they could not take latex balloons into the hospital because of concerns about possible problems with allergies.

So, they released the balloons into the sky.

'I made a wish,' Lori Traycoff said, 'that you get your phone call' — and a new heart.

The Traycoffs will return, and Lori promised to stay in touch with Robin.

'Moms need support, too,' Lori Traycoff said.
