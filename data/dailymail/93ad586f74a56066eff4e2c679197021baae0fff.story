This is the shocking moment a mother and her sister abandon her baby after a supermarket security guard confront them for shoplifting.

Freshly released CCTV catches Allison Niemeyer, 19, and her 22-year-old sister Laura casually walking out of the Walmart in Ocala, Florida, pushing the innocent one-year-old in a shopping trolley.

What the grainy footage does not show is the $60-worth of stolen goods, including men's white undershirts, a bathing 
suit and four women's shirts, allegedly stuffed into a diaper bag in the trolley's hold.

Stop thieves! An eagle-eyed security guard attempts to apprehend the sisters

But as an eagle-eyed security guard attempts to apprehend the sisters, Allison swiftly passes her child to her sister and flees apparently without a second thought.

Laura instantly follows suit leaving the baby alone in the supermarket's foyer.

But while the guard follows in pursuit, the women escape into the car park.

A person driving a blue Ford Aerostar van picked up the women in the store's parking lot.

Incredibly, neither women ever came back for the child. Instead they were finally caught dancing in a nearby disco inside the Ocala Entertainment Complex two days later.

They were both charged with felony child neglect and a string of other offences.

Allison Niemeyer was also charged with violating her probation.

She
 was supposed to be under house arrest until 2021 for her role in a 
October 2010 home invasion while she was pregnant with her baby.

Police said the young woman was among
 five teenagers involved in the robbery where one of them pistol-whipped a 61-year-old man.

Laura
 Niemeyer, meanwhile, has a lengthy criminal record that include 
convictions for three prior retail thefts, grand theft and uttering a 
forged instrument.

She was also charged with resisting a merchant in the recent Walmart incident.

The baby is now in custody of the state's Department of Children and Families.
