Manchester United's American owners are set to raise around £89million by selling more of their shares in the club on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Premier League club announced on Wednesday that the Glazer family is selling eight million shares with reduced voting rights, which equates to around 5 percent of the business.

The Glazers, who maintain control of the club, previously sold 10 per cent of their holding via a stock listing in 2012.

The announcement comes two months 
after Malcolm Glazer, who led the family takeover of United in 2005, 
died. His six grown children control the club.

The
 latest share sale was announced on a day when United shares closed at 
£11.44, with the Glazers cashing in at a time of renewed confidence at 
the club.

Former Netherlands
 and Barcelona coach Louis van Gaal has taken charge following a dismal 
first season of the post-Alex Ferguson era under David Moyes that saw 
the team finish seventh and fail to qualify for the Champions League.

United
 also signed a 10-year kit sponsorship deal earlier this month with 
Adidas, announcing that it would be worth an overall £750million from 
2015.

But United has 
disclosed to potential investors in the new share prospectus that 
failure to play in the Champions League for two or more consecutive 
seasons would see the annual Adidas payments drop from that second year 
by 30 per cent from £75m to £52.5m.

Passing: The decision to sell more shares comes just two months after the passing of former United owner Malcolm Glazer

If United are relegated, Adidas can 
cut their payments in half during seasons out of the Premier League, and
 give a season's notice to terminate the sponsorship. Conversely the fee
 could rise by up to £4m each year if the team wins the Premier League, 
Champions League or FA Cup.

A loss of Champions League revenue from UEFA is already set to cost the club around $60 million next season.

'Our
 success and many achievements over the last 20 years does not 
necessarily mean that we will continue to be successful in the future, 
whether as a result of changes in player personnel, coaching staff or 
otherwise,' United said in the share prospectus.

'A downturn in the performance of our first team could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain coaches and players.'

United
 said success on the pitch is key to 'the value and strength of our 
brand and reputation,' with a global array of sponsorship deals helping 
the club generate an estimated revenue of around £430m for the year to 
June 30, 2014.

Claiming to 
have 659 million followers around the world has helped to drive up 
turnover in recent years, but United has conceded that 'our popularity 
in certain countries or regions may depend, at least in part, on 
fielding certain players from those countries or regions.'
