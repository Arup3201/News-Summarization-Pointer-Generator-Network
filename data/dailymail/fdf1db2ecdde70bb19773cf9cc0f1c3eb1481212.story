Mystery deaths: Sharon Price, holding a photo of cat Olli, has lost four cats in two weeks

Pet owners on a quiet Coventry cul-de-sac are locking up their cats after at least nine die in just tree weeks.

Several cats are still missing in what the residents believe is a string of assassinations carried out by an angry neighbour.

RSPCA are now investigating the mysterious cat deaths after five owners lose their pets in just two days.

Sharon Price, a mother-of-two has lost four cats in just two weeks. Brother and sister Olli and Lilli, seven, Ziggy, five and seven-month-old kitten Annie all suddenly fell ill.

‘Without doubt someone has been killing off cats - and I don't know how they can live with themselves,’ Sharon said.

‘My children and others on the street are absolutely heartbroken and distraught, they are part of our family.

‘I hope whoever has done this is caught.’

Last month, Ms Price, 42, noticed Olli had been vomiting and feeling unwell. Eventually his condition became so severe he had to be put down.

Just five days later Ziggy suffered the same fate and within a week all four pets had to be put down by vets.

Clayton Emms - whose cat, Tilly, has been missing for nine days - believes someone has been been luring cats to drink poisonous antifreeze after becoming incensed by the high number of animals on the street.

Mr Emms, 43, said: ‘There have been incidents in the past of some neighbours moaning about the number of cats on the street.

‘And on several occasions a couple in a silver car have been spotted eyeing up cats on the street.

‘Since they were seen, cats have been dropping like flies.’

Cat killers: At least nine cats have died and several are still missing on this cul-de-sac in Coventry and owners believe one of their neighbours is poisoning their pets

After Tilly’s disappearance followed by the death of his neighbours' pets, Clayton is now too scared to let his other cats out of the house.

The RSPCA are investigating at least nine deaths in the close and surrounding streets but admit the number could be much higher than expected.

Tests have not been carried out and it is not known if the incidents were connected, deliberate or accidental - but the charity said all had symptoms of poisoning.

Neighbour Bartosz Bartczak also believe the deaths are a result of a feud on the cul-de-sac which has spiralled out of control.

Mr Bartczak, 35, who lives a few doors down from Sharon Price, said: ‘We haven't seen our cat Lexus in over a week and it's extremely worrying as it's a quiet area, if he's been killed we just want to know instead of panicking.

Unexplained deaths: Sharon Price's Olli and seven-mont-old kitten Annie also had to be put down

After the deaths of several cats, including Sharon Price's Lilli, residents on the street are keeping their cats locked up inside

‘I am absolutely certain someone is killing our cats, around lots have died already and many more are ill or missing - that is no coincidence.

‘In the past there's been neighbours who've said there's too many cats on the street, saying they make too much noise at times, rummage around in bins and dig up gardens.

‘Those are just small things - to start poisoning cats is outrageous. How can someone just kill pets because they don't like them?

‘My youngest daughter is so distraught she cannot stop crying - we're all upset.’

The RSPCA are now urging owners to be extra vigilant, and handed out leaflets on common poisons animals ingest - such as antifreeze.

If a cat ingests even a small amount it can lead to kidney failure.

RSPCA animal welfare officer Ben Jones said: ‘It is really sad to hear that so many cats have died in such a short space of time.

‘As yet we do not know if this was deliberate or accidental but we do want to remind people that deliberately poisoning an animal is illegal and could mean a £20,000 fine and even six months in prison.’
