The number of elderly people being admitted to accident and emergency departments has soared to more than 1.2million a year, figures have revealed.

The numbers of over-80s taken to A&E has risen 37 per cent in two years, according to the Department of Health figures – from 913,785 in 2007/08 to more than 1,247,672 million in 2009/10.

Last night campaigners blamed a crisis in out-of-hours care provision and Britain’s increasing ageing population.

Revealed in a Parliamentary answer, the figures will add to the pressure on casualty departments amid fears that many are already struggling to cope with too few staff and not enough beds.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the Commons Health Select Committee, warned last night that the NHS was in danger of ‘going bust’ unless an ‘urgent solution to the crisis of social care’ is found.

He said: ‘These figures show the serious impact that our ageing population is having upon the NHS.

‘We must get to grips with how we 
ensure that the elderly are best cared for- more than ever, we need to 
find an urgent solution to the crisis of social care we are likely to 
face. Otherwise the NHS will likely go bust under the demands placed 
upon it.’

David Cameron and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley promised the NHS will not be affected by cuts to public spending.

But medical groups and charities warn health spending is failing to keep pace with the rising cost of the ageing population.

A poll of GPs and hospital doctors 
earlier this week found that four out of five doctors said they had seen
 patient care suffer as a result of health service cuts during 2011.

Ruthe Isden, of Age UK, said: ‘There is a general sense 
that there is a problem with inadequate and patchy out of hours 
provision.

'People can find themselves unable to access the help they 
need from GPs or community services at night or the weekend, as a result
 they may turn to A&E due to a lack of an alternative.

'Lack of access to end-of-life care services at home and in the community may also be a problem.’

She added that the rise in admissions was also due to poor management of chronic and long term conditions.

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said more elderly people were being forced to fend for themselves,  leaving them more vulnerable to injury.

Health Minister Paul Burstow blamed the increase on Labour’s botched handling of GP contracts which allowed them to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends.

He said: ‘Labour’s disastrous decision to stop GPs being responsible for out of hours care meant that hospitals saw huge increases in the number of vulnerable patients having to go to hospital.

‘These figures expose the extent of Labour’s failure. Under the Coalition’s plans, GPs will take responsibility for out of hours care and we are establishing a new 111 urgent care system that will mean everyone will get the care they need first time round.’
