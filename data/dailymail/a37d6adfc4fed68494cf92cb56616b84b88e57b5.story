A powerful bomb today killed six and wounded more than 30 others after it exploded during rush hour in a city in the south of the Philippines.

Troops and police closed off the area along Sinsuat Avenue in Cotabato city as firefighters and ambulances arrived at the chaotic scene, where witnesses saw at least four people bloodied on the pavement as cars and buildings burned after the explosion.

The fire damaged power and telephone cables, causing power outages in nearby communities, police said.

Indiscriminate: The bomb exploded during rush hour in the southern city of Catabato. It is unclear who was the target

Inferno: The blast set fire to neighbouring buildings and left bodies and rubble strewn across the street

Senior Superintendent Rolen Balquin, 
who heads the city police, said the dead included a police officer 
aboard a passing van. Another police officer on board that van was 
wounded by shrapnel and was in critical condition in a hospital.

At least 33 people were wounded by bomb shrapnel and flying debris from cars and motorcycles damaged by the explosion, he said.

Cotabato,
a bustling trading hub 545 miles south of Manila, has been hit 
previously by bombings blamed on Muslim rebels and extortion gangs. 

The bomb exploded this afternoon as a 
bulletproof SUV, carrying city administrator Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi, was 
passing by. Sayadi was not hurt but one of her police bodyguards in a 
security van was killed, officials said.

Balquin said they were looking at the 
possibility the attack could have targeted Guiani-Sayadi. He said the 
city administrator 'had been receiving threats for the past few days.'

National
Police chief Alan Purisima ordered regional and provincial police 
offices in the southern Philippines to step up intelligence and 
security, particularly for soft targets such as commercial areas and 
other places where people converge, said police spokesman Senior 
Superintendent Reuben Theodore Sindac.

President Benigno Aquino III's administration condemned the bombing and vowed to hunt down those responsible.

'We condemn the use of violence to kill and maim our countrymen who are peacefully going about their daily lives," Aquino's spokesman Herminio Coloma said. 'We'll hold accountable these criminals who terrorise our society.'

Philippine authorities did
not immediately point to any suspects, but government forces have been 
on alert in the volatile region due to recent attacks and bombings by a 
breakaway Muslim rebel faction opposed to peace talks between the 
government and a main insurgent group.

Suspected
members of the rebel faction, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Movement, 
detonated a bomb that killed the manager of a bar and wounded four 
others along Sinsuat Avenue in Cotabato city last July, the military 
said.

The breakaway 
guerrillas oppose talks between the government and the 11,000-strong 
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, predicting the negotiations would go 
nowhere.

They vowed to 
continue fighting for a separate homeland for minority Muslims in the 
south of the largely Roman Catholic Philippines.
