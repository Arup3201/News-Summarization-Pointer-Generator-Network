Cherie Blair said employers should be encouraged to create more part-time and family-friendly jobs

Cherie Blair has called for stay-at-home mothers to get Government-funded training and subsidised salaries to help them get back to work and boost the economy.

The wife of former prime minister Tony Blair said more women could get back on the ‘ramp into employment’ if the state offered support in the first six months of their return to work.

Mrs Blair suggested ‘returnerships’, which would be ‘like an apprenticeship but for those who have been out of the labour market due to caring responsibilities’.

And she said employers should be encouraged to create more part-time and family-friendly jobs to encourage women to return, boosting the national workforce.

In an essay for the charity 4Children, the barrister wrote: ‘The businesses that get these measures right – in a world in which human capital matters more and more – will win the battle for talent.

‘Helping families, especially mothers, back on the “ramp” into employment … has to be a priority.’

The mother-of-four said that her own experiences had led her to campaign for more jobs that allow women to care for their families and work at the same time.

‘I was so intent as a young lawyer on beating the men at their own game that I didn’t take any real maternity leave with my three younger children,’ she wrote.

‘It is only looking back that I realise I wasn’t beating the system but reinforcing it.’

There are currently two million women and around 200,000 men out of work because of caring responsibilities. Two thirds say they stay home out of choice.

Mrs Blair, 59, said a bigger change is needed in ‘the culture of work’ so that women don’t miss out on opportunities:  ‘Many of the big decisions over progression, promotion and future career trajectory are taken when people are in their late twenties and thirties, putting women at a huge disadvantage because this is the very time they are most likely to be having a break to have children.

‘But changing our society so  our workplaces are truly open  to the talents and life choices of women, and indeed people of all backgrounds, needs real leadership and effort.’

In her essay Mrs Blair suggested introducing back-to-work schemes for men and women who have been caring for their children could be key to economic recovery.

‘At a time when boosting economic growth is at the top of every politician’s “to do” list, this would be a good place to start,’ she said.

Mrs Blair said her views are influenced by her mother’s work ethic.

‘[She] gave up her career as an actress to look after my sister and me, was abandoned by her husband and, with no maintenance forthcoming, took a job in a fish and chip shop to support us,’ she said. ‘This experience, as well as my professional ambition, instilled in me a strong feeling that maintaining a career and a family life was both desirable and necessary.’
