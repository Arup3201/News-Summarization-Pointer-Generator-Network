British shoppers are paying more for gadgets, clothes and accessories than US shoppers because the pound is at a five-year high.

Gadgets including the latest Apple iPad and Xbox One are more than £100 cheaper in America than Britain, while accessories are also far less expensive - including a Tiffany Harmony diamond and platinum engagement ring which costs £10,300 in England but only £7,477 in the US.

The discounts are due to the current strength of the pound, which has hit $1.70 for the first time since 2009.

The study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes, accessories and make-up to be far cheaper in the US than the UK. Gadgets including the Xbox One were also much cheaper

A study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes and make-up also to be far cheaper abroad.

Ugg boots cost £60 less in the US, while some Victoria’s Secret items are up to £30 cheaper across the Atlantic. Nike ID trainers are also 41 per cent cheaper in the US than the UK.

British Airways said the potential for huge savings made America the top destination this summer for British holidaymakers, with New York deemed the best for stocking up on goods.

Claire Bentley, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said: ‘New York is one of the best places in the world to go shopping, especially now you can literally get more bang for your buck.

‘If you’re thrifty enough, the savings you can make could even pay for your trip.’

Many large US department stores are also known to offer further discounts in an attempt to attract international visitors, with Macy’s offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off.

The findings come after it was revealed British shoppers are also paying as much as 60 per cent more for high street fashion brands than the rest of Europe.

Retail figures revealed global chains including H&M, Zara and Mango hike up prices for their UK customers.

A snapshot survey of 20 items sold by major chains in 14 countries showed the UK to be more expensive than Spain, the US, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Poland.

A Zara tunic dress on sale for £49.20 in Spain cost more than £20 more in the UK while t-shirts from the same store worked out to be more than double the price in Britain.

Researchers for foreign currency firm Caxton FX found the average UK mark-up for items from the international stores was 18 per cent.

The only country which was consistently more expensive than the UK was Switzerland.

Global fashion chains typically claim their prices are higher in the UK because rent, rates, staff costs and taxes are higher.

But analyst Neil Saunders, from retail consultancy Conlumino, said last month: ‘Retailers will look at each individual country to see what consumers are willing to pay. If they can charge more in the UK, they will.’
