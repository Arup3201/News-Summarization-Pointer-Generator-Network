Artists are known to find inspiration in drink: Vincent van Gogh famously drank absinthe and Salvador Dali enjoyed a glass of Champagne.

But a British artist currently taking the world by storm relies on drink - to paint with.

Carne Griffiths, 39, uses tea to create his fantastical pictures, which he then sells for up to £4,000 apiece.

How refreshing: Artist Carne Griffiths used washes of tea to create the colour effects in this work, entitled 'Find Yourself'

The Liverpool-born artist has been 
drawing since he was a young child and has spent years perfecting his 
technique using the unusual medium.

Mr Griffiths said: 'I love to involve drawing in my work, and using ink and tea allows me to create repeating layers of drawing which I then wash away partly with tea, and make new drawings from what appears beneath.

'I don’t like to be idle, I suppose drawing is a form of meditation for me so I get my relaxation at those times in the studio.

'I think if you are passionate about something, it will find its way into everything you do.'

Mr Griffiths previously worked producing gold wire embroidery for the military, which sparked his desire to move into using textiles with his work.

He said: 'Experimenting with new materials and liquids means that the work is constantly facing new challenges.

'I am currently working with different alcohols to create portraits using brandy, whisky and vodka to create layers within the work.

'I try not to get bogged down too much in process. There are certain elements which are common to all pieces such as washes of tea, expressive graphite marks, detailed areas in fountain pen ink, the foundation to all this is drawing.'

Mr Griffiths says his personal life provides inspiration for his art - and has drawn his baby twin children in tea.

He graduated from the Kent Institute of Art and Design in Maidstone in 1995.

He
moved to London and did an apprenticeship as a gold wire embroidery 
designer before beginning a 12-year career drawing embroidery designs 
for clients including the Prince of Wales, Tom Ford, Asprey, Burberry, 
Chanel and the Sultan of Oman.

Mr
Griffiths set up his own studio in 2010.  Since then he has exhibited 
in the UK at the Royal Academy's London Original Print Fair and the 
London Art Fair.  He has also shown his work in Ibiza and New Orleans, 
and has recently collaborated with the British photographer Rankin for a
feature in Hunger Magazine.

He
said: 'I am excited about 2013, with a number of opportunities to show 
work throughout the UK and overseas in Hong Kong, Italy and the States.

'I am looking forward to producing some floral designs for a clothing designer in Spring and am always flexible about the direction my work takes, providing it allows me to do what I enjoy most.'
