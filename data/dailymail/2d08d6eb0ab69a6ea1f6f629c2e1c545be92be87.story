Battle: The wine companies who lay claim to the distinctive Babycham logo of a leaping baby antelope have lodged a High Court writ against Cath Kidston Ltd

One is instantly recognisable as the logo of Babycham sparkling perry.

The other adorned Cath Kidston products at Christmas – but has left some feeling anything but festive.

Babycham has launched legal  proceedings against the British homeware company, claiming its use of a baby deer with a ribbon on its neck infringed the drinks firm’s rights.

The High Court writ also claims that the appearance of the logo on Cath Kidston products aimed at under-18s associates Babycham ‘with a blatant disregard for industry codes of  practice to protect children’.

The Guildford-based company behind the drink wants an injunction to stop Cath Kidston using the image, plus destruction of all products marked with it.

But Cath Kidston denies perplexing shoppers, insisting that – although  its seasonal deer image and the Babycham logo are both ‘hoofed ruminants, unaccustomed to wearing ribbons’ – there is no confusing similarity between the two.

Lawyer Philip Roberts said: ‘The differences in the manner of execution speak for themselves, not least  . . . the absence of horns and the springing “springbok” stance.’

Barrister David Wilkinson, for Western Wines Holdings Ltd and Accolade Wines Ltd, said in the writ: 'The claimants and their predecessors in title have, since 1953, used in relation to Babycham sparkling perry and related goods various iterations of a logo with the common theme of a baby chamois with a ribbon tied round its neck.

'Indeed Babycham was the first alcoholic brand and the second ever brand to be advertised on commercial television in the UK with a campaign in 1957.

'Cath Kidston Ltd has used and continues to use a logo in relation to its Christmas 2012 advertising campaign and range of related goods, which depicts a baby deer with a ribbon tied around its neck, which is substantially similar to the Babycham logo,' adds Mr Wilkinson.

'Their use in the course of trade of the Kidston Logo without due cause in relation to goods similar to those for which the registered marks are registered, take unfair advantage of, and is detrimental to, the distinctive character and repute of the Babycham logo,' it states.

'A drink, its packaging and any promotional material or activity should not in any direct or indirect way have a particular appeal to under-18s. The use of the Kidston Logo includes use on products relevant to under 18s, such as children's clothes

'The application of the Kidston Logo to goods relevant to under-18s is liable to cause serious tarnishing and detriment to the repute of Babysham by associating (it) in the minds of the public and trade with a blatant disregard for industry codes of practise to protect children.'

Mr Roberts, for Cath Kidston Ltd, states that 'no admissions' are made as to the ownership of the trade mark and that the two wine companies should be 'put to strict proof thereof.'

Denying the two logos are substantially similar or have confused shoppers, he continued: 'Since 1953...Babycham branded sparkling perry has featured a particular stylised illustration of a springing chamois goat-antelope with a blue ribbon tied round its neck.

'It is admitted and averred that Cath Kidston Ltd has featured various images of young deer in relation to its Christmas 2012 range of goods and associated advertising campaign.

'It is denied that any of the said deer are "substantially similar" to any of the chamois.

'While it cannot be denied that, by nature, deer and chamois are both hoofed ruminants, unaccustomed to wearing ribbons, the differences in the manner of execution speak for themselves, not least arising out of the absence of horns and the springing "springbok" stance.'

Catherine Isabel Audrey Kidston MBE, is 54 and was born in Marylebone, London. Cath Kidston Limited sells home furnishings and related goods through shops, online and by mail order. She is particularly known for her nostalgic floral patterns

Kidston opened her first shop in London's Notting Hill in 1993, selling hand-embroidered tea-towels and brightly renovated furniture.

In February 2010, the company was valued at £75 million when she sold a majority stake of the company to private equity investors TA Associates, retaining a minority stake and remaining the company's Creative Director.
