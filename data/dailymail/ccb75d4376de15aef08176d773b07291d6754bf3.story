Brazilian police are to use surveillance drones to monitor crowds at the Confederations Cup football tournament, paving the way for their use at next year's World Cup.Â 

The unmanned aircraft are among a raft of security measures being brought in including thermal cameras, stadium fly-overs by Air Force fighter jets and helicopters kitted out with surveillance equipment including high-resolution, night-vision and thermal cameras.

The Confederations Cup football tournament gets underway this weekend, with thousands of fans from across the world expected to attend.

But experts say visitors will be immediately vulnerable to street crime once they venture away from secured areas.

They may run even a greater risk than 
usual, as many police are being taken from their regular street duties 
to patrol areas around the stadiums.

Last week Sportsmail columnist Adrian Durham was mugged at knifepoint in Rio de Janeiro after England's friendly against Brazil.

Officials said they've deployed the most extensive security apparatus ever in what is regarded as a dry run for next year's World Cup.

'We are strongly concerned with 
ensuring safety and security to all our athletes, tourists, heads of 
state and delegations,' Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo told reporters on a 
conference call earlier this week.

Some
45,000 personnel will be deployed in the tournament's six host cities, 
according to SESGE, the government agency created in 2011 to coordinate 
security at the mega-events.

According to SESGE, one guard will be
assigned for every 50 spectators at the matches, which kick off on 
Saturday when Brazil plays Japan in the tournament's opening game in the
capital, Brasilia.

In addition to 3,500 military police officers, the security detail at Saturday's match will also include a battalion of riot police with two armored vehicles, a canine unit of sniffer dogs trained to detect drugs and explosives as well as eight sharpshooters, said Fabio Pizetta, the head of Brazilia's riot police division.

As host for the event, as well as a 
papal visit in July, next year's World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, 
Brazil's government is going to great lengths to curb crime and 
violence.

But the country still has an alarmingly high murder rate, and armed thefts and carjackings continue to be facts of daily life.

Express
kidnappings, where individuals are abducted and forced to withdraw 
funds from automated teller machines to secure their release, are 
common, as are muggings, robberies, pickpocketing, bag snatching and 
drug dealing.

Following the 
partial collapse of the roof of the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador there 
were grave concerns that the tournament may not go as smoothly as 
planned.

The Fonte Nova 
Participacoes (FNP) group, which manages the stadium, is adamant the 
collapse of the roof was nothing more than a freak disturbance.

Brazil's preparations for the World 
Cup are believed to be behind schedule and two of the six stadiums 
scheduled for use at this month's tournament missed FIFA's deadline.

Last month police staged a series of 
rigorous training exercises in preparation for the Confederation Cup 
which saw participants posing as hooligans staging mock riots.

There
was also similar training exercises in Rio de Janeiro, where the 
military practised their crowd control routines and the Navy were 
drilled to guard against any potential terrorist attacks.
