This is the moment a woman is shown pictures of her dead brother after she hired a hitman to have him murdered.

But what Larisa Kazakova didn't know is the images were faked.

The hitman she had hired for the equivalent of £1,500 was actually an undercover police officer. 

She was caught after a hidden camera caught her nodding her head in approval before handing the money over.

Kazakova, 32, is now facing eight-and-a-half years in prison for attempted murder.

 Larisa Kazakova, 32, is seen approaching the car of the 'hitman' she hired to kill brother Mukhtarbek, 29

She enters and the 'hitman', who is actually a police officer, shows her pictures of her brother apparently dead

She is caught on camera as she nods her head in approval and hands over the equivalent of £1,500 in cash

The mother-of-three and brother Mukhtarbek, 29, had moved to the central Russian city of Surgut two years ago in the hope of finding work and sending money back to their families in Kyrgyzstan. 

But she complained that although she worked in several places as a cleaner, her brother had not got a job and was just living off her hard work.

She then decided to try and find a hitman to get rid of him.

She claimed that he was violent when she had tried to move away from him and that because both of them were in the country illegally, she was unable to go to police.

But when police heard about her bid to find a hitman after she started looking online, they arranged for an undercover officer to promise to carry out the hit. 

The police staged this shot of Larisa's brother Mukhtarbek, complete with fake bullet wound, with his approval

She was caught after police showed her pictures of her brother after he had apparently been shot. 

But a hidden camera in the car where the money was supposed to be handed over shows the woman scrolling through them and nodding her head in approval - apparently not shocked at the bloody photographs.

Officers had staged the pictures with the brother's consent, and she was arrested when she handed the money over.
