Twin Siamese girls who are joined at the chest and share the same heart 'will have to remain together', doctors have said.

The conjoined twins, Anais and Amanda Cruz, from Chile, were born five months ago, and it was unclear whether an operation could be carried out to separate them.

Now, surgeon Dr Humberto Caballero, who is caring for the girls, said: 'The twins were sent to have tests done now that they are five-months-old.

'The conclusion is that the girls hearts are joined, and as a result the babies will have to remain together.'

Anais and Amanda Cruz, now five months old, were born joined at the chest and share one heart

Tests have been carried out and doctors now say they will never be separated, as they were born with a heart defect which results in low levels of oxygen in their blood

Experts said the twins were born with a Cyanotic heart, a condition which results in low levels of oxygen in the blood, and usually leads to a shorter life span in children.

Dr Caballero added: 'The heart condition means that it's impossible to separate them and it would also be out of the question to remove one so that the other might live and develop normally.' 

Amanda and Anais are having tests done at the Catholic University of Santiago, Chile, but will shortly return to Vallenar, in the Chilean province of Huasco, where they were born, and will remain there for the future. 

Their father Waldo Cruz, 41, said that as long as the twins were alive they would care for them and give them as much love as possible.

He said: 'As long as they are here it is heaven's will, and we will care for them.'

The twins, who are joined at the chest and face each other, are known as 'thoracopagus' twins.

This is the most common type of cojoined twins: 40 per cent are in this group, according to the Seattle Children's Hospital Foundation. 

Mother Ana Robledo and father Waldo Cruz said as long as the twins were alive they would  give them as much love as possible. Mr Cruz said: 'As long as they are here it is heaven's will, and we will care for them'

Dr Humbert Caballero, who is treating the girls, says it would be 'out of the question' to remove one so that the other might live and develop normally

In about 75 per cent of cases, such as Anais and Amanda's, thoracopagus twins share one heart.

Twins joined at the chest may also share their liver, biliary tract (which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine) and upper digestive tract.

They are normally delivered by Caesearean section as a vaginal birth is too difficult for the mother and babies.

Only 35 per cent of cojoined twins survive for one day after birth, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

However, among those who survive more than a day after birth, some continue to live for days, weeks, months or years while conjoined. Some live into adulthood still physically connected to each other. 

In December 2014, MailOnline reported on the brith of Asa and Eli Hamby, who were born in Atlanta. They can never be separated as they share one heart and one circulatory system

In December 2014 MailOnline reported on the case of conjoined twin brothers who share the same body and also share the same heart, who were born in Atlanta, U.S..

Asa and Eli Hamby can never be separated as they have a condition known as dicephalic parapagus - an extremely unusual form of conjoinment, affecting only one-in-a-million births.

They will have to remain together because they share one heart and one circulatory system.

The rare and extremely risky pregnancy carried through to 37 weeks and Robin and Michael traveled from Alabama, U.S., to Atlanta's Northside Hospital for specialist care.  

Conjoined twins are two children physically connected to each other at some point in their bodies.

The lowest odds of this happening are 200,000 to one for every live birth and around 70 percent of conjoined twins are female.

Conjoined twins are always the same sex and the form of conjoined twinning refers directly to where they are joined.

The most most frequent are horacopagus (heart, liver, intestine), omphalopagus (liver, biliary tree, intestine), pygopagus (spine, rectum, genitourinary tract), ischiopagus (pelvis, liver, intestine, genitourinary tract), and craniopagus (brain, meninges). (American Pediatric Surgical Association)

Experts think that conjoined twins come from a single egg that fails to separate.

Around 200 conjoined twins are born each year and around half die before their first birthday.

Veena and Vani, ten, were born joined at the head, but their parents left them in their local hospital in Hyderabad, India because they could not pay their medical expenses.

For eight years the girls have eaten, played and slept in one room at Niloufer Hospital and have been cared for by nursing staff. They cannot be separated.

Their doctor, Dr Narendra Kumar, a paediatric surgeon, is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation.

He said: 'It has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains.

'The problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks.'

Laleh and Ladan Bijani caught the attention of the world when at the age of 29 they decided to have surgery to separate.

The sister's skulls were joined above the ear but each of their brains was intact. They were never able to look into one another's face without the aid of a mirror.

Their dream was to walk out of Raffles Hospital in Singapore and walk in opposite directions. Sadly they both died after their surgery.

Born in Tehran in 1974, they developed different personalities and made separate groups of friends.

Ladan was the stronger personality and was more talkative, while Laleh was quieter. So when Ladan said she was determined to become a lawyer, Laleh had no choice but to study law with her.

Conjoined twins Shivanath and Shivram Sahu caused quite a stir when they were born in India, with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations.

And while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12-year-olds, who were born joined at the waist, the duo are determined to remain together.

Shivram said: ‘We don't wish to get separated. We will stay like this even when we grow old. We want to live as we are.’

The pair, who were born in a tiny village near Raipur in central India, share two legs and four arms and work in tandem to get around.

They have stunned doctors with their ability to wash, dress and feed themselves.

A local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them.

They are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs, hearts and brains.

With practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss, including showering, eating, getting dressed and combing each other's hair.

They are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split-level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighboring children.
