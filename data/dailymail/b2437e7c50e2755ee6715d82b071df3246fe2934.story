Germany is the most popular country in the world despite its tough austerity policies towards struggling EU nations, a poll of more than 26,000 people worldwide has found.

In response to the question: 'Tell me if you think each of the following countries is having a mainly positive or mainly negative influence in the world' 59 per cent said positive for the economic powerhouse.

Even in Spain, which has been forced to live with stringent austerity measures resulting from a German-led rescue package, 68 per cent felt good about the country - up on last year.

More people in Britain also shared the opinion, with favourable attitudes up eight points to 78 per cent, with France the keenest towards its neighbour at 81 per cent.

But Greeks, included in the annual BBC World Service poll for the first time, gave it the worst rating with 52 per cent saying it was a bad influence.

The country has seen anti-German protests depicting Chancellor Angela Merkel as an enemy for her insistence on fiscal belt-tightening.

The UK registered the most improvement this year in the wake of the 2012 Olympics, helping it rise one spot to third position with 55 per cent positive ratings, behind Canada.

Japan fell from first place with 58 per cent last year to 51 per cent, taking fourth place in the survey.

Positive views of the EU dropped to 
their lowest level last year but have stabilised this year, rising one 
point to 49 per cent on average.

Reflected in UKIP's upsurge in popularity, more Britons rate the EU's influence negatively (47 per cent) than positively (42 per cent) for the first time this year. Positive views of EU 
influence have been falling steadily in the UK since 2008.

Iran remained the worst regarded country - even more unpopular this year at 59 per negative rating - followed by Pakistan and 
North Korea.

Positive views of China also slid sharply to 42 per cent while negative views rose by the same amount to reach 39 per cent. After improving for several years, views of China have sunk to their lowest level since polling began in 2005.

India saw a similar decline, with negative views up eight points to 35 per cent and positive views down six to 34 per cent. Overall, China is ranked ninth and India twelfth.

Perceptions of positive US influence on the world fell across its traditional allies the UK, France and Germany. On a global scale, however, views have only slipped slightly, from 47 per cent to 45 per cent.

PIPA and GlobeScan conducted the research for the BBC.

Director of PIPA Steven Kull said: 'While China and India’s prestige was enhanced by defying the gravity of the economic downturn, they seem to be falling back to earth with slowing growth rates and a perception of widespread corruption. The scandals surrounding the treatment of women in India may also have had an impact on this year’s findings.'

GlobeScan director Sam Mountford said: 'With ratings of most countries declining this year, it appears that frustration with governments in general is growing, as nearly five years on from the financial crisis they seem incapable of pulling their economies out of the slump.

'But the "Olympics effect" looks to have allowed the UK to buck this negative global trend.'

A total of 26,299 citizens across 25 countries were interviewed face-to-face or by telephone between December 10, 2012 and April 9, 2013.
