The first NHS staff left today to join the fight against Ebola at British-built clinics in Sierra Leone.

A group of 33 medics - including GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and paramedics - left London's Heathrow Airport and will arrive in the capital of Freetown early tomorrow morning.

They are the first wave of NHS volunteers to be deployed by the Government. More than 1,000 NHS staff have volunteered to travel to fight the deadly disease.

The staff will complete a week of training before moving to Ebola treatment centres across the country.

There they will start work diagnosing and treating those who have contracted the deadly virus - which has killed more than 5,000 people.

Dr Hannah Ryan, 29, from the intensive care unit at Aintree University Hospital, was one of those flying out today. 

She said: 'I guess there are many reasons I volunteered for this; I am interested in infectious disease medicine, I have always wanted to do humanitarian work, I wanted to take on the challenge of working in this complex environment. 

'But mainly I found myself less and less able to hear about the evolving situation in west Africa and the increasing loss of life and do nothing. I felt I just had to go.

'The first aim of this operation is simply to get well-trained staff there to open more treatment centre beds and see more patients, and do it safely.

'I hope more NHS staff, particularly nurses and laboratory staff, will hear about this and be encouraged to volunteer. '

Dr Mark Willcox, 26, a GP from the Wirral, said: 'I am in a position to go and help. I was greatly assisted by the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin in getting a medical education so it's a privilege to give something back. 

'We have received superb training by the UK military, who really should be recognised for their outstanding efforts in this crisis.

Response: International Development Secretary Justine Greening said  1,000 British military personnel, scientists, healthcare and aid workers have been deployed to help fight Ebola

'My GP practice has been hugely supportive of me going which has been fantastic.'

Dr James Lavers, 37, an intensive care registrar from Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, said: 'I decided to volunteer for the Ebola response in Sierra Leone because this could be the biggest medical disaster of my lifetime, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the region. 

'To prevent this from happening and save vast numbers of lives, large-scale intervention has to happen now.'

Dr Roger Alcock, a consultant in emergency and paediatric medicine at Scotland's Forth Valley Royal Hospital, said: 'I have respect for the situation in Sierra Leone but I think with the training we've had we will be able to make a difference. 

'My colleagues have been incredibly supportive, both on an individual and an organisational level. I think I have the skills as an emergency physician to help.'

Thomas Waters, 26, a paramedic with the West Midlands Ambulance Service, said: 'I feel anxious and nervous but confident in the training that we have had by the military so we can practise safely. 

'If we can make a difference to just one life, it will all be worth it. It is important to remember we are the first wave and here to develop a platform for other volunteers to follow on from us.'

More teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services.

They have been preparing for deployment with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York.

Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said: 'I have been really impressed with the numbers of NHS workers who have stepped forward to help the communities that have been devastated by Ebola.

Prepared: NHS staff will undergo a week's intensive training after arriving in Sierra Leone tomorrow. More teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services

Committed: Within a week, British volunteers will be treating patients with the deadly Ebola virus in west Africa. They have been preparing with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York

'The fact more than 1,000 have come forward so far is a real testament to their commitment to public service.

'I want to offer my thanks to all those that are going, their efforts will make a real difference in West Africa.'

A Swiss hospital says a Cuban doctor who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone is in a stable condition after nearly two days of treatment.

Felix Baez Sarria was flown to Geneva and was able to walk off the transport plane in a protective suit and mask after landing late Thursday night.

The Geneva University Hospital said Saturday that "today his health status is stable, although he remains in a serious medical condition." He is being treated in a special room in an area isolated from the rest of the hospital.

Baez, a member of a medical team Cuba sent to Sierra Leone, caught the disease when he rushed to help a patient who was falling over. 

Professor Tony Redmond, head of the charity UK Med, said: 'The actions of these selfless volunteers in going and the actions of their colleagues and managers to release them and cover for their duties is testimony if ever there was to the altruism that lies at the core of the NHS. I am very proud of them all'.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said Britain's response to the crisis was one of its biggest to a disease outbreak, with almost 1,000 military personnel, scientists, healthcare and aid workers already on the ground.

She added: 'But to beat Ebola we desperately need the experience and dedication of skilled doctors and nurses to care for the thousands of sick and dying patients who are not receiving the treatment they need.

'Every one of these NHS heroes will play a vital role in the fight against Ebola. It is only because of their combined efforts that we stand a chance of defeating this disease.'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'I want to thank the brave NHS volunteers who are heading to Sierra Leone today to help in the fight against Ebola.

' They embody the values at the heart of our health service, and their expertise and dedication is second to none.'
