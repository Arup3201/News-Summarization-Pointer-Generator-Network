Hollywood ' svengali' Sam Lutfi insists there was 'no trickery' in getting troubled former child star Amanda Bynes into a psychiatric hospital.

Lutfi, the controversial ex-manager of Britney Spears, spoke out to MailOnline to insist he did bring her back to Los Angeles from New York two weeks ago - despite her parents Lynn and Rick Bynes' denial that they are working with him.

Today, he details the sad events that saw Amanda put in a psychiatric hold and admits he bought the star her plane ticket home following her very public meltdown.

Despite earlier reports that the Bynes were forced to lie to Amanda to get her to the clinic, Lutfi tells MailOnline, 'There was no trickery. She knew where she was going.'

Once Amanda was in the hospital, Lutfi syas he told her to 'stay calm, to take her time, to gather her thoughts. I felt that she feels, deep down, that she needs help.'

Restraining order: Sam Lutfi worked with Britney Spears at the time of her public breakdown - her mother Lynne (pictured left) then filed for a restraining order against him

By her side: Sam Lutfi was a constant presence by Britney Spears' side. Her mother Lynne said he 'essentially moved into Britney's home' and took control of her life, home and finances

Lutfi, 40, first hit the headlines in 2008 when he was working with another former child star, singer Britney Spears, at the time of a breakdown that saw her shave off all her hair and led to her father taking control of her affairs.

A shadowy figure constantly by the star's side, Britney's mother Lynne Spears would eventually file a restraining order against Lutfi.

In the order, Lynne said her daughter met Lutfi in October 2007, and that he 'essentially moved into Britney's home and has purported to take control of her life, home and finances.' 

She described witnessing a situation of tight control and manipulation, with Lutfi calling the shots on her medications, cutting her phone lines, and deciding who could see the pop star..

Lutfi would go on to work with singer Courtney Love, who sings his praises, and told MailOnline that he first heard from Amanda before a court ordered her parents to take over her conservatorship in August last year.

He said: 'We remained in contact ever since. She was curious about the Britney situation. I figured that deep down in her mind that she felt she may have needed some help. And that's why I feel she called me.

'And then I got a call in mid-September, she said she was back in New York  and she wanted help in finding a manager and a lawyer. I asked her to please 'call your parents, talk to your counselor'. And that's when she informed me that the conservatorship was over. It sounded like she was doing well from the initial call. But subsequent calls proved otherwise. But I still advised her to stay in contact with her parents and counselors first and foremost.'

A source revealed that Amanda actually changed her cell phone number and stopped calling her distraught parents, who became 'extremely concerned' after she arrived in New York and displayed erratic behavior that included her being accused of shoplifting. She was also accused of trying to steal a hat from high end store Barneys, although charges were not filed.

Things came to a head when Amanda posted shocking tweets claiming her father Rick  physically, sexually and mentally abused her as a child, which she soon took down.

The friend said: 'Sam bought Amanda a ticket back to LA, as friends were imploring her to apologize to her father and speak to her lawyer.'

Detailing what exactly happened after Amanda landed back in LA on October 10, Lutfi said: 'Upon arriving in LA, Amanda was to take a car. At that point, her family and her lawyer took over her whereabouts. They decided where she would go and I guessed her doctor was involved as well.'

The source added: 'Amanda called her parents when she landed and agreed to meet them at Las Encinas Hospital. She wanted to let them know she was okay and that she was fine and then she would leave. 

'She wanted to prove that nothing was wrong, but things went a different way.' 

Amanda was originally put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, which was extended to a 14-day hold on Monday, October 13, and is believed to be receiving treatment at Las Encinas Hospital. It is the second time in a year she has been put in a hold.

As People stated, if Amanda won't accept treatment voluntarily and is ruled unable to care for herself, her doctors could choose to ask for an LPS conservatorship, a one-year psychiatric hold they likely plan to request that in the coming days.

Amanda and her current treating psychiatrist would have to appear in the Los Angeles Central District Mental Health Courthouse for this type of conservatorship (LPS is short for Lanterman-Petris-Short Act) to go into place.

The source told MailOnline: 'The psychiatric hold is unfortunate, but a good thing for Amanda, because if she is properly diagnosed and if she is put on the right medications and undergoes therapy this will help. It's not her fault, it really is a disease.' 

Speaking at her California home on Monday, Lynne Bynes, 67, denied Lutfi's claims, saying: 'Don't worry, we're not working with Sam.'

When asked how Amanda, 28, is doing, Mrs Bynes said: 'She is fine.' 

Just hours before Amanda arrived in LA and was was rushed for psychiatric help, she tweeted:  'you feel like a brother to me @SamLutfi i mean it. Thank you luuuuv.'

Despite the Bynes' claims,  Lutfi published a bizarre self-penned piece on XOJane.com at the weekend, where he said he had tried to help Amanda.

Admitting to being called 'shady' and a 'Svengali', Lutfi attempted to defend himself, saying: 'I’ve worked in Hollywood for a long time, and over the years, these experiences have led me to see what happens when too much fame and too much money can sometimes get the best of celebrities.

'I am a problem solver, and I care about helping people get out of what may seem like some of their more difficult places in life. 

'Which is why you have seen me associated with some of the more famous celebrities when they are in their most trying hours.'

He also said that he has no problem being slandered if it helps other people get better. 

Lufti also included a Facebook message from Courtney Love in the article, which read: 'Good job Sammy, that one needed your help. Quite heroic how your (sic) always helping strays, no you cannot have my cat!'

He other messages from the Hole singer in which she praised him for helping her stay sober - and she said 'you can quote me on that.'

Lutfi added: 'Amanda is a beautiful, amazing and very strong woman who has been through a lot. So are Courtney and Britney. Like me, they are also survivors.' 

Britney Spears' mother Lynne Spears, meanwhile, blamed Lutfi for his involvement in her daughter's breakdown, when he managed her in 2007 and 2008.   

As her family lawyer Tamar Arminak said, her family are hugely relieved she is receiving help after they hatched a plan to have her driven to a medical facility when Amanda thought she was going to a lawyer's office.

An LPS conservatorship would put Amanda under the care of a court-ordered conservator who would be in charge of her person and her finances.

Terry K. Wasserman, an attorney specializing in mental health legal services, who has not represented Bynes, said it would have to be proven she is 'gravely disabled'.

He told People: 'Her parents would have first choice to act as conservator if they wish, but the court can appoint alternative individuals.

'It can be the Los Angeles County Public Guardians office, it could be a private professional conservator that's licensed and bonded by the state of California, or it could be a family friend."

This type of conservatorship would legally place Amanda in the proper care facility. It also allows the conservator to enforce compliance with any psychiatric medicines prescribed to her by her doctor.

Amanda - who is said to be furious with her parents, according to TMZ - would have the right to visitors under this type of conservatorship, but she can elect to not allow her parents to see her. 

Mr Wasserman said: 'There's a number of rights she [would maintain] for her dignity and welfare. She's entitled to visitations even if she's LPS conserved. She can't be forced to visit with her parents if she chooses not to see them.'

Although the LPS conservatorship lasts for one year, it can be ended early or extended longer depending on circumstances.

Once terminated, Amanda could go back to living on her own. 

Asked about the Bynes, a source told the publication: 'They're happy she's safe and that Amanda is finally getting some help.'
