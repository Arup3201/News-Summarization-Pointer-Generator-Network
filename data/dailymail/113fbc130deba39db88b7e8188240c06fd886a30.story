Chelsea are assessing goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after he damaged a finger on his right hand during the defeat at Tottenham.

The Belgian was seen nursing his fingers as he came off the pitch at the interval during the match at White Hart Lane. 

Mourinho is still to ascertain the full extent of the problem but has a more than capable deputy in Petr Cech to call upon if necessary.

The Blues boss said: 'He (Courtois) has a problem in one of his fingers. Let's see what happens.

'I don't know (if it's broken). I didn't ask. I just asked if he could carry on at half-time (at Spurs).' 

Next up for Chelsea is a home tie against Watford in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday, a game in which Courtois seemed likely to be rested anyway, before the visit of Newcastle in the Premier League next weekend.
