At last, Jimmy Greaves has made it into Tottenham Hotspur’s Hall of Fame.

It only took 11 years and 41 others - including Steffen Freund and Paul Allen - to come before the club’s greatest ever goalscorer, with 266 goals in 379 appearances, was rewarded.

Depending who you speak to, the long wait is down to Greaves declining the offers, or the club not forthcoming with them.

The truth lies somewhere in between, with Greaves understood to have turned down informal invitations in the past but accepting, according to sources close to the former striker, their first formal request last week. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter how he got there. He is there now; number 42.

Despite claims to the contrary, Greaves has been back to White Hart Lane on many occasions since he left the club in 1970. He went back for the funerals of Bill Nicholson and Bobby Smith and launched his autobiography ‘Greavsie’ at a dinner there.

He just hasn’t been back for football matches. But he’s only been to one football match - a Chelsea game with his Chelsea-mad grandson - since he quit playing 35 years ago.

Wherever he goes, he is constantly asked by Tottenham fans why he is not recognised as one of their greatest by the club.

‘For all the fans who have asked me when I will be in the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame, I am delighted that we now have a date,’ Greaves said upon the announcement on Monday. ‘I am looking forward to returning to White Hart Lane for this very special occasion.’

Greaves, now 75, joined Spurs in 1961, signed by Nicholson for £99,999 from AC Milan to alleviate the burden of being the first £100,000 English player.

In the preceding nine years, he would go on to win the FA Cup twice, FA Charity Shield twice, the European Cup Winners Cup and finish runner-up in the old First Division, scoring 220 goals in 321 league matches.

He was gutted and angry when he was eventually sold to West Ham, but that’s not why he doesn’t go back to White Hart Lane for matches. Greaves just likes watching games on the telly.

In response to accusations that he turned down an invite to the League Cup final when his two former clubs Chelsea and Tottenham met on March 1, he replied: ‘At no point did Spurs invite me to the game. I wouldn't have gone if they did, but I was not invited.

‘I've got a lovely giant screen HD TV, a lovely dog and a warm fire. That's where I watch sport including football and it's very nice. I'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold. I love it on TV.’

Greaves is also England's fourth-highest scorer, netting 44 goals in 57 games for his country

Greaves also loved playing, and is still England’s fourth-highest scorer with 44 in 57 appearances, but he has not shunned Spurs matches, or those of any other club, with any malicious intent.

‘I don't go to games, I never ever have,’ he added. ‘When I was young I played all the time. I've never supported one team over another and I don't apologise for that. I enjoy watching at home on TV.’

Regardless of the rows or the disagreements or how he got there, when Greaves is inducted on May 13, he will finally be in Tottenham Hotspur’s Hall of Fame
