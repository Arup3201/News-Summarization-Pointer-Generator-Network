A mother's true love for her child has been captured in this set of photographs taken of a polar bear and her cub. 

The proud mum showed off her baby at Novosibirsk Zoo in Russia by showering it with affection and cuddles. 

Mother Gerda rolled around in the cold snow nestling her daughter into her chest.

A perfect love: Polar bear Gerda, six, cuddles up with her cub at Novosibirsk Zoo in Russia

After some time, the pair were worn out and the youngster fell asleep in her mother's arms. 

The photographs were taken by photographer Vera Salnitskaya, 29.

She told The Siberian Times: 'It is almost impossible to watch them together because is so pure love, the kind you can only dream about. Such love and tenderness. 

'You look at them and just feel that these are the most perfect mother and daughter relations you have even seen.' 

The cub was born on 11/12/13 and Novosibirsk Zoo is asking members of the public to help name the youngster.
