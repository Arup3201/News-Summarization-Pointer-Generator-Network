Autumn Pasquale's 16-year-old killer pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter today after admitting he strangled and choked the Clayton Middle School student to death last October.

Justin Robinson was 15 when he was arrested alongside his brother Donte, then 17, in Clayton, New Jersey, just days after the 12-year-old girl went missing in 2012.

Robinson was 'voluntarily waved to adult court' during his hearing on Wednesday morning and pleaded guilty to Judge Walter Marshall Jr, NJ.com reported.

Autumn Pasquale was brutally murdered in October in her hometown of Clayton, New Jersey,

The teenager now faces up to 17 years 
in prison for the crime, 85 per cent of which must be completed before 
he's eligible for parole.

His brother Donte also faces charges but today's hearing only focused on Justin, who will be sentenced in September.

Autumn Pasquale's body was found in a recycling bin on an abandoned property next door to the brothers' home.

She was found just days after she went missing in October and the brothers were arrested within hours of her body being located.

Police believe the teens lured 12-year-old 'tomboy' Autumn to their home under the pretense of trading bike parts and killed her.

An autopsy concluded she had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of sexual assault.

Just three months after her killing, Autumn's parents began fighting over the money that community members donated to help ease
 the financial burdens of their daughter's tragic death.

Evidence? Authorities did not confirm the bike was the one belonging to Autumn, but it matched the description of the white BMX she was seen riding Saturday afternoon before she disappeared

The divorced parents, Jennifer Cornwell and Anthony Pasquale, were squabbling over $100,000 in memorial donations.

Heartbroken
 members of the community in Clayton donated the money - first to secure
 a reward when Autumn went missing on October 20, and later to pay for 
funeral expenses after her body was found stuffed in a recycling bin at a
 neighbor's house.

Autumn's
 mother Jennifer filed a lawsuit against her ex-husband Anthony in 
February after he removed her name from the memorial fund bank account, 
which had about $85,000 remaining.

She
 asked a judge to give her half the money and order Anthony Pasquale to 
stop making decisions about Autumn's grave site and headstone without 
her.

Autumn's 
disappearance in October brought together the southern New Jersey town 
where she lived and - briefly - reunited her parents who had been 
separated since  2002.

Ms
 Cornwell, said her ex-husband took Cornwell’s name off the memorial 
fund bank account that they had agreed to control together to pay for 
their daughter’s funeral, legal expenses and help with the college 
education for their two surviving children.

Life cut short: Authorities found some of Autumn¿s belongings in the teens' house including the white BMX bike she was last seen riding when she left her West High Street home in the New Jersey town

She also says her ex-husband had refused to consult her on what the girl’s headstone should say.

Ms Cornwell asked a judge to split the memorial fund so that each parent could have partial control and to bar Mr Pasquale from completing the headstone design without Ms Cornwell’s input.

Court filings lay out acrimony between the girls’ parents: Cornwell moved out in 2002 when her children were 4, 3, and 1 years old.

Though the parents legally had joint custody, they spent most of their time living with their father.

The couple were divorced in 2005, seven years after they married.

Cornwell says her ex-husband did not inform her that their middle daughter was missing until two hours after police were called on October 20.

Pasquale says his ex-wife picked up items left at a funeral home by mourners without his permission. She contends he said it would be OK. He also says she was wrong to withhold money from a fundraiser from the fund.

She says the money - a $15,500 check plus unspecified cash - is in a safe-deposit box where she placed it after learning she no longer had control of the bank account.

OCTOBER 20, 2012: Autumn Pasquale, who was a week away from her 13th birthday, was last seen riding her BMX bicycle, leaving her home in Clayton, New Jersey. Authorities – from the Gloucester County police to the FBI – joined the search. Her father, Tony Pasquale, told NBC News at the time that the disappearance was ‘not like her'.

OCTOBER 21: Hundreds of people gathered at a local church to hand out flyers and form search parties for the freckled blonde. 

OCTOBER 22: Hundreds more join search efforts for Autumn, spanning into Delaware and New York. After sunset, worried friends and family held a candlelit vigil to pray for her safe return. Not long after the vigil ended, authorities said that they discovered her 5ft2in body dumped in a recycling container five blocks from her home. 

OCTOBER 23: A press conference was held in the afternoon to say that two brothers, aged 15 and 17, had been arrested for Autumn’s murder. Authorities also said that the brother’s mother, spotting a suspicious post on Facebook, turned them into police.

AUGUST 7, 2013: Justin Robinson, now 16, pleads guilty to aggravated manslaughter. He will be sentenced in September.
