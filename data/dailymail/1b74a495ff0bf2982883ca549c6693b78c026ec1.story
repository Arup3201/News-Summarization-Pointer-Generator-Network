The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department has released shocking video footage showing the final moments of a 25-year-old black man who was shot by officers after he approached them wielding a knife and shouting ‘shot me’.

The incident occurred on Tuesday just four miles from where unarmed teenager Michael Brown had been shot by police on August 9. The dead man has been named as Kajieme Powell, who was reportedly known in the local community as 'disturbed'.

The police department announced that it was releasing not only cell phone video taken by a witness, but also the 911 calls, dispatch audio and video showing the man shoplifting, in a bid for complete transparency.

The man shot dead by police in St. Louis on Tuesday has been named as 25-year-old Kajieme Powell

The owner of the convenience store had called 911 on Tuesday after he suspected Powell had stolen two drinks and donuts from his shop, according to a recording of the call. The security camera footage corresponds with this.

The owner of a local beauty salon also called police to report that Powell was acting erratically and had a knife in his pocket. 

The cell phone footage starts with Powell acting agitated outside the store. He places the two cans  on the ground and then paces about as he waits for the cops to arrive.

As the two officers get out of their vehicle, Powell starts walking towards them with a knife - late established to be a steak knife - in his hand and he repeatedly shouts ‘shot me.’

When he ignores commands to drop the knife, the two officers fired a total of 12 shots, before cuffing him even though he is dead.

'I don’t think any of us can deny that the tension not only in St. Louis but around the county and the world because of the activities in Ferguson over the last 10 or 12 days certainly has led to us making sure that we got this right and answered as many questions as we could as quickly as we can,' Police Chief Sam Dotson told St. Louis Public Radio.

On Tuesday he had said that his officers had opened fire on Powell after he came within three to four feet of them holding a knife 'in an overhand grip.'

However the cell phone footage shows Powell not that close to the cops and with his hands at his side. 

Dotson later acknowledged discrepancies between his Tuesday account and what the video revealed. 

Final moments: Powell, 25, was apparently known in the local community as 'disturbed'

He told CNN that although Powell's hands were down by his sides, he was moving toward the officer with a knife in his hand.

'The officers did what I think you or I would do, they protected their life in that situation,' he said.

Dotson was asked why the officers hadn't opted for an alternate form of defense like a Taser.

'Certainly a Taser is an option that's available to the officers, but Tasers aren't 100 percent,' he said.

'So you've got an individual with a knife who's moving towards you, not listening to any verbal commands, continues, says, "shoot me now, kill me now." 

'Tasers aren't 100 percent. if that Taser misses, that [individual] continues on and hurts an officer.

'In a lethal situation, they used lethal force,' he added.
