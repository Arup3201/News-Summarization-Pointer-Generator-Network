The gambling aspect of Tim Sherwood’s management style has been a major contributing factor to Harry Kane’s ridiculous rise to prominence, and the striker knows it.

Kane is set to start for Tottenham against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on Sunday, but knows his career might have gone down a much different path.

That’s down to Sherwood, who the 21-year-old says changed his prospects. Kane wants other players to be given similar opportunities and believes there is a lack of faith in prospects.

The pair had previously worked together before the now Aston Villa boss was handed the first-term reins last season.

And, even though Kane had impressed in fits and starts, he hadn’t looked like breaking through permanently. Now, with 24 goals in 37 games this season, Roy Hodgson is certain to call the youngster up to his England squad next month.

‘Tim Sherwood first of all played me [regularly] in the Premier League,’ Kane told Sport magazine. ‘I knew Tim from the development squad, and we had a great relationship.

‘He threw me in when maybe other managers wouldn’t have. Maybe that’s what a few more young strikers coming through need.’

Kane’s rise to prominence has been swift, the plaudits plentiful; some have characterised the front man as a hybrid of Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham.

‘I can see a bit of both in me, which isn’t bad, to be honest,' Kane added. ‘To be compared to someone like Alan Shearer is very special. He’s the all-time Premier League top goalscorer. If I score anywhere near as many as he did, it wouldn’t be a bad career.

‘I feel sometimes I play in both of those roles for Spurs, and I see little bits that they had in my game. Shearer was a great finisher, and I like to think I’m a good finisher.

‘Sheringham brought others into play, so you can definitely say I have some similar attributes. Hopefully I can do well and continue to score goals, and one day people will say that this player is like Harry Kane.’

It matters little to Kane who he resembles on Sunday, so long as it is he who sinks Chelsea. This was the Spurs fan who stood in the stands in 2008 to watch his team beat the Blues and who is now living out his childhood dreams.

‘I was there watching Spurs beat Chelsea on the big stage, and winning trophies,’ Kane said. ‘It was something I grew up dreaming of doing, and now I have the opportunity.

‘To win a trophy for a club like Spurs would be something very special, but we want to try and get into the Champions League too, so we’re focused on doing the best we can in every competition.’
