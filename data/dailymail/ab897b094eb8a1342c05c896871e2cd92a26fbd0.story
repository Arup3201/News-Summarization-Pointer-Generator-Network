A 10-year-old Montana schoolboy and talented footballer has died two weeks after being bitten on the leg by a brown recluse spider.

Keith Pierce, a student at Three Forks District School, was taken to Bozeman Deconess Hospital on September 30 after his leg started swelling up.

After ruling out cancer, doctors sent him home, but he was rushed to St Vincent Hospital in Billings last Friday when his pain and symptoms worsened.

Two days later, he underwent emergency surgery, but never woke up. In the early hours of Monday morning, Keith's parents made the heartbreaking decision to end resuscitation efforts.

Following the youngster's tragic death, a forensic examination 'determined the cause of death as severe sepsis due to complications of a spider bite', NBC Montana reported.

In Keith's case, the condition was caused by the venomous bite of brown recluse spider, the Yellowstone County Coroner told the boy's mother, Mandy, according to KRTV.

On Monday, counselors and ministers were brought to the school to speak with parents, teachers and students.

Since Keith's death, a Facebook page called 'Remembering Keith Pierce' has been set up, on which family and friends have shared their happy memories of the youngster.

Wayne Hawkins, from Three Forks, wrote: 'I so enjoyed coaching Keith. He was an amazing young man who was a true joy to be around.'

Meanwhile, Karla Shanks Slyngstad said: 'So sad. Prayers and strength to the Pierce family. This is going to be hard on the entire town of Three Forks.'

Spider: Also known as the fiddleback spider, the brown recluse spider has venomous, potentially fatal, bite

A Keith Pierce Memorial Fund has also been created to help raise funds to help his family.

Also known as the fiddleback spider, the brown recluse spider has venomous, potentially fatal, bite. 

The creatures are usually brown or gray in colour and between six to 20 millimeters in length. They typically have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax,

These markings include a black line coming from the dorsel side that looks like a violin,  resulting in the nickname 'fiddleback'.

The spiders often build their webs in dry, generally undisturbed locations, including sheds, closets, garages, cellars and other similar places. 

In America ,their range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through to southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, to southwestern Ohio.

In the southern states, they are native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky.
