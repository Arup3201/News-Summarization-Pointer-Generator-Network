Bayern Munich forward Arjen Robben insists Manchester United are still a force to be reckoned with despite the English champions' struggles this season.

Bayern and United were drawn together in the Champions League quarter-finals on Friday and the German side - the current European Cup holders are favourites to go through.

But Robben thinks his team-mates need to be wary of United's European pedigree and they should not be taken lightly.

All smiles: Robben's Bayern side are favourites to go through against United

Main man: Robben says Wayne Rooney is United's star player and is a 'fighter'

He said: 'Manchester United are Manchester United - that has not changed just because their form in England is not great.

'They are a club that are very comfortable in the big European games, many of their players have won the Champions League before, and we can't dismiss them.

'They are in transition at the moment with a new coach - but I am sure they will be a big test.

'It is looking like winning the Champions League will be their best chance of playing in it next season - so I think it is clear how seriously they will be taking the two games.'

Robben also warned his team-mates to be wary of Wayne Rooney, the man he still sees as United's star player.

The Holland winger said: 'They have many good players - but Wayne Rooney stands out for me. He has great qualities - but also he never stops fighting on the field - he has a great attitude.

'There is confidence that we can retain the competition - but nobody thought, "Oh great we have an easy tie".'
