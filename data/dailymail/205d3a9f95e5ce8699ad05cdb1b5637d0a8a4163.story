Roy Hodgson will host a dinner for his England players at the end of January in an attempt to build a better team spirit.

England’s head coach has come up with the idea because the national team doesn't have another fixture until the Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania in March.

England signed off for 2014 with six straight wins after their disastrous World Cup in Brazil, where they failed to record single victory.
