Fixers willing to fake payslips and bank statements for cash are helping desperate househunters secure out-of-reach mortgages, an undercover investigation revealed today.

Bablu Khan was secretly filmed agreeing to pretend to be a homebuyer's employer and produce bogus documents for £400. 

Khan bragged that he was doing the same for at least four people every day as banks become more strict on how much Britons can borrow and as prices, especially in London, go through the roof.

Denouement: This is the moment Bablu Khan was confronted by journalists after he had offered them fraudulent documents to help secure an out-of-reach mortgage

Deal: In return for £400 Khan said he would produce fake payslips like this one proving that the mortgage applicant worked for him

Investigative journalist Paul Connolly exposed him for the Channel 5 series Black Market Britain: Undercover Sting. 

Khan, who advertised himself on Gumtree, showed him fake letters of employment and backdated payslips he would use to 'prove' that he earned a larger salary and would transfer money into his account so the back were not suspicious. 

It is getting harder to secure a mortgage with banks demanded more paperwork and evidence of spending before agreeing to lend. 

In June house prices surged to another new record high of £188,903 in June as they jumped nearly £20,000 in just a year.

In the footage, to be shown in the series that starts tomorrow evening, Khan says: 'I can show you that you are working for us. I can fill this form, send a P46 and fax to Inland Revenue tomorrow morning and I can show that you are working with me backdated. Tomorrow morning (I can) give you three months’ payslips.'

He adds: 'Bank will give you straight away the money' (sic).

He boasts: 'In this country you need to use your brain otherwise you are working hard, hard, hard.'

Pledge: The fraudster promised lenders would never learn the journalist was cheating the system because he could produce back-dated payslips showing he earned at least £30,000

Changing hands: The documents worked for at least four people a day the con artist said, making him at least £5,000 a week

On the run: As soon as he was confronted Khan fled the scene refusing to face the fact he had been breaking the law

He even hinted that lenders were in on his scam saying: 'I have a thousand lenders I know so I can call them, provide them with all of this and they can give you the mortgage.

'If you go the straight way, they’ll not give it to you… I can go… to the interview and we can talk in the restaurant. Anything you need, he can tell me and paperwork – I can get it for you.

'When everything is ready… you can go to the bank and he’ll tell you which branch is better and who to ask for. If everything is done you can give him £200 in his pocket.'

But after being handed the fake documents, the undercover reporters turn the tables on the fraudster and confront him with their real identities.

They then chased him down the street but according to Black Market Britain producers he refused to answer any questions.

Paul Connolly said: 'I was amazed at how busy he claimed to be and how much money he said he was making. But he was incredibly casual about what he’s doing.

'Anyone tempted to go with someone like him could end up saddled with a loan or mortgage they couldn’t afford.

'He seemed to think he was invincible – but we showed him, and now we’ll show the viewers, that he was far from untouchable.'

He added: 'I've got a dossier of evidence about this guy. If police want to pursue this, they know where I am.'

The first in the series of Black Market Britain: Undercover Sting will be broadcast on Channel 5 at 8pm on July 10, 2014. The series will air on 10, 17 and 24 July
