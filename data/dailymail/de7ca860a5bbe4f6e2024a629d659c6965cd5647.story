Corey Pye, 21, from Basingstoke said he is facing a lifetime of debt after his phone was stolen three days into his week-long trip on the Balearic Island

A holidaymaker who lost his iPhone in Ibiza has received a bill from Vodafone for £19,000 after failing to tell the firm it was missing for five days.

Corey Pye, 21, from Basingstoke said he was facing a lifetime of debt after his phone was stolen three days into his week-long trip on the Balearic Island.

He assumed the iPhone 4s could not be used because it was password protected and only reported it stolen when he returned home in September.

But he was horrified when a bill for £6,439.76 landed on his doormat a few days later.

Realising he had made a mistake he took out a 36-month personal loan to pay off the debt, but when his next monthly bill came through it was £12,450.35.

'It's ruined my Christmas. I don't know what to do. I was so shocked when I got the bill,' he said.

'I'm a young lad and this will be hanging over me for the rest of my life. I'm still paying off that six grand off.

'I shouldn't be punished for the naivety of failing to report my mobile missing, or for the criminal acts of others who are the ones profiting from this.' 

Mr Pye has been a Vodafone customer all his adult life and his contract includes unlimited UK calls, unlimited texts and 1GB of internet for £17.50 a month, but not overseas calls

His first bill included his £17.50 contract fee £0.41 for messaging and mobile internet and £5,348.56 for calls with £1,073.29 in VAT.

Mr Pye said Vodafone offered him little assistance in clearing the debt, so he decided to face up to his mistake and took out a loan to pay it back in November.

But on December 4 he received a second demand for £12,450.35 because, according to Vodafone, the first bill did not cover the whole period before the number was cut off.

This bill breaks down as £17.50 for the contract, £10,350.11 for calls, an admin fee of £2.94, a late payment fee of £4.17, a copy bill charge of £2.54 and VAT of £2,074.36.

He is now in negotiation with the mobile phone giant over the second bill.

When he returned home and reported it missing he received a bill for £6,439 which included £17.50 contract fee £0.41 for messaging and mobile internet and £5,348.56 for calls with £1,073.29 in VAT

On December 4 he received a second demand for £12,450.35 which included more than £10,350.11 for calls

But he is furious that the company allowed such a huge bill to be accrued without cutting off the phone.

He said: 'Vodafone should not have allowed such ridiculous call charges to go uncapped.

'They are really useless at helping out. They will just hang up or say they will contact you in three days.

'I can't afford to pay the rest so I have to fight it.

'They won't give me a final date on when this will be resolved, if it even will be.

'I have a new 24 month contract with them. I can't even leave them. I have been a customer with them all my life and I get this.' 

Since publicising his story, a spokesman for Vodafone said he would only be held liable for £500 of the fraudulent charges.

'It is very easy for criminals to rapidly build up high charges using stolen phones, which is why we encourage customers to report phones missing as quickly as possible,' said the spokesman.

'Customers are liable for charges up to the point they report the phone missing and we have the opportunity to bar it. 

'However, this would appear to be part of organised criminal activity and in recent weeks we have reviewed the extent of that liability in these cases. 

'Following a review, Mr Pye will be liable for £500 worth of the fraudulent charges. We will contact Mr Pye to make arrangements to reimburse the payments already made less £500.'

Mr Pye (right) did not think his phone could be used because it was password protected and only reported it missing when he returned home after five days
