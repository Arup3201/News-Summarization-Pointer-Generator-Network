A 39-year-old mother of seven in Oklahoma has died of a rare form of cancer - a year after her husband hit an improbable half-court shot at an NBA game and pledged his $20,000 winnings to help her beat the disease.

Jenni Kufahl received the most devastating news of her life in October 2012 when doctors told her she had cancer in her appendix. To make matters worse, it was Stage III and she faced a slim chance of surviving. 

On Monday, 24 hours after her death, her family posted a note to the Facebook page that said, 'She is walking the streets of gold. Jenni will have no more 
tears. She will see no more death. She will know no sorrow or crying.'

Shock: Jenni was in shock after her husband's spectacular shot at an Oklahoma City Thunder game in March 2013

Winner: The crowd erupted at last year's Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game when Heath, a high school basketball coach and fervent Thunder fan, made the unlikely basket

Her husband, Heath, was a teacher and coach Christian Heritage Academy in Del City, where faculty and students raised funds to help offset their medical expenses, which included multiple rounds of chemotherapy.

Mrs Kufahl also required surgery at a hospital in Houston, Texas, and subsequent treatments in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to local outlet News9. Through it all, friends and neighbors had also volunteered their time to provide food and help with their seven children, according to Newsok.com.

Her father, John Merrell, a longtime football coach at the academy, missed his first game in 39 years in order to be by her bedside at the hospital days after she was diagnosed in 2012, according to OurNewsOklahoma.com. 

Mrs Kufahl had worked as a teacher, home-schooling some of her children, while her husband taught economics and Bible studies at the academy, according to ABCNews.com. 

Mr Kufahl,
who also coaches volleyball and boys basketball at the school in Oklahoma, 
became the first fan in three years to hit a half-court shot at The Chesapeake Energy Arena, according to NewsOK.com.

He was given the opportunity after he scouted out the person responsible for choosing the lucky-shot participants when he and his wife had been at a previous game. 

'When he made it, I was totally 
shocked,' Mrs Kufahl told ABCNews.com. 'The look on my face shows shock,
 I didn't even move. That just went in. I couldn't believe it.'

He scores: Making a half court shot at an NBA basketball game is always pretty special, but for Heath Kufahl, pictured as he scored last year, the $20,000 in winnings helped pay for his wife's medical bills

She said in the ABC News report that she and her husband didn't get home until midnight that night of the NBA game and woke some of their children to share the good news. The family huddled around watching YouTube videos of the miracle shot into the wee hours of the morning.

'It wasn't luck we got picked and had this shot,' Mrs Kufahl told ABC News 'It was the Lord going before us, providing opportunity.'

Leaving a legacy: Jenni Kufahl, leaves behind her husband, four sons and three daughters

Expensive: With seven children, the Kufahls had higher-than-average bills even before her diagnosis.
