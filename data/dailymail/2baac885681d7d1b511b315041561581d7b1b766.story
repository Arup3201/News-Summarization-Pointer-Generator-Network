A mother-of-two whose estranged husband poured industrial-strength chemical detergent over her in a horrific case of domestic abuse says that she has forgiven her attacker and is moving on with her life. 

Carmen Tarleton, 45, who had to have a face transplant due to her injuries, told ITV's This Morning that the decision to forgive her former husband, Herb Rodgers, 'left me with room to grow, to move on with my life and free to meet someone and trust them.'

She was joined on the sofa by her new partner Sheldon Stein, a music teacher in Vermont, who she met when she enrolled for piano lessons.

Sheldon said that they met before 
Tarleton had had her face transplant, but that he had 'noticed her 
incredible spirit and that she was ready to live life again.'

Tarleton was doused in Lye by her former husband Rodgers in 2007 in a frightening case of domestic violence. She suffered chemical burns over 80 per cent of her body and her face was completely disfigured.

She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley that she had married Herb in 2001 and that the marriage had been a happy one.

'We didn't have a lot of complicated issues,' she said. 'I was not a typical battered wife and he had never been abusive to me before. So it was more than shocking when it happened.'

It was when the couple moved from Los Angeles to Tarleton's native Vermont that the problems started.

'He [Rodgers] did start to unravel the year we moved back,' she said. 'I knew he was struggling but I didn't know what to do or how to help him.'

The couple, who had two daughters, separated but remained good friends. However a few days after an argument about the sale of their house, Tarleton woke up at 2.30am to find someone in her house.

She thought it was a burglar, but soon realised it was Rodgers. He pushed her down on the bed and started beating her with a baseball bat so viciously that she could hear her bones being broken. Before blacking out, she called out to her daughters, then aged 12 and 14, to lock themselves in the bathroom and phone the police.

It was then that Rodgers produced a bottle of industrial-strength cleaning fluid which he had brought with him, and sprayed her face and body. He then waited for the police to arrive and was arrested at the scene. 

Tarleton was in a coma for three months and lost the sight in both eyes, although the sight in one has now returned. 

In February 2009 Rodgers was sentenced to a maximum of 70 years in prison, 30 of them without parole.

Tarleton's appearance was so shocking that news reports about her were given a 'graphic images' warning and she said that she found the way people were disturbed by her appearance upsetting. 

However last year more than two dozen doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital worked for 15 hours to give the disfigured Vermont woman new facial skin, including neck, nose, lips, facial muscles arteries and nerves.

Talking of her decision to forgive her ex-husband, Carmen told This Morning: 'Forgiveness is not about them at all, it's not about condoning what they did, it's about you, about your self-esteem and confidence. I have forgiven him and it's left me room to grow.' 

Since the attack, Tarleton has become an inspirational public speaker as well as writing a book, Burned, Blinded and Blessed, about her experiences.

She also signed up for piano lessons, which is where she met her partner, Sheldon Stein.

She described meeting the daughter of the donor Cheryl Righter, who died in February last year aged 56 from a massive stroke, as 'a blessing, a great experience, it's been great for both of us.' 

Cheryl's daughter Marinda Righter said that after meeting Tarleton for the first time, she felt a profound joy, as she literally was able to see her motherâ€™s features return to life.

'I get to feel my motherâ€™s skin again, I get to see my motherâ€™s freckles, and through you, I get to see my mother live on,' Marinda Righter said. 'This is truly a blessing.'

Tarleton's life-changing face transplant was the fifth the Boston hospital has performed and the doctors said that Carmen can expect to regain almost full functionality in her face.

In her book Carmen says that she wouldn't 
take back what happened to her, insisting she is 'more blessed' now than
 she was before Rodgers broke into her home and unleashed his anger.

'When life gives you a big negative 
situation like I'd been through, if you can get through that, you can 
really find all of the blessings and all of the positive things that can
 come out of that,' she said.

'And I found so much that I would not go back. I'm so much more blessed than I was then.'

While
 she lay in a hospital bed after surviving what doctors called 'the most
 horrific injury a human being could suffer,' Tarleton decided it did 
not have to ruin the rest of her life.

She had vivid dreams, including one where dozens of doors stretched around her and a voice said 'Life is a choice,' before the words appeared one at a time in white across a dark movie screen: LIFE IS A CHOICE.

1. James Maki received a partial face transplant at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in April 2009 after he fell onto the electrified third rail of the Boston subway 
when he was 55, leaving him with severe burns. It was only 
the second such procedure to be performed in the United States and 
seventh in the world.

2. Dallas Wiens, a 26-year-old Texas man who accidentally struck a power line when painting a church received the country's first full face transplant in March, 2011 at BWH.

3. Mitch Hunter, 30, of Indiana, who was disfigured after an auto accident, received a full face transplant at the hospital less than a month later.

4. Charla Nash, was the third patient and underwent the procedure in May of 2011. She made headlines when her neighbor's chimpanzee mauled her in 2009.
