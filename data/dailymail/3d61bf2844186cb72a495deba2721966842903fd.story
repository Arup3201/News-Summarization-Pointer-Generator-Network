Not content with a pop career that has lasted for almost three decades, Kylie Minogue is now making waves in the interior design world - and has launched her very own range of curtains.

The singer's designer drapes will join her 'At Home' bed linen and cushion collection which launched in 2008.

The curtains, which come in several different designs, mirror Kylie's classic Hollywood glamour look and come in chic soft oyster and dramatic dark purple.

Glamorous: The plum 'Verity' drapes form part of Kylie Minogue's brand new curtain collection

Talent: The Australian pop princess has had her own collection of bed linen and cushions since 2008

According to Kylie, the designs were inspired by her lavish stage costumes, combined with a passion for vintage textiles.

In keeping with the vintage theme, fabrics include luxurious crushed velvet, taffeta and cotton woven with shimmery threads.

The designer drapes can also be customised with diamante beads for extra pop star sparkle, should you require.

Prices for the curtains, which will be sold via Curtains-2go, start at Â£116 per pair, although you'll need to cough up a bit more should you wish to get your hands on Kylie's top picks - the Messina design in dove grey and the Seville curtains in plum.

Classic: Kylie's Cairo curtains feature diamante embellishment and come in elegant oyster-coloured fabric

Although Kylie's homeware range is among the more stylish on offer, she certainly isn't the only celebrity to try her hand at interior design.

In June, Fearne Cotton launched a typically quirky oriental-inspired collection of armchairs and cushions for Very.co.uk.

Other celebrities to offer homeware to their fans include Linda Barker, who has a range of sofas at DFS, Katie Price and her hot pink and black bed linen line, and Kirstie Alsopp who has designed a collection of kitsch home accessories for Marks & Spencer.
