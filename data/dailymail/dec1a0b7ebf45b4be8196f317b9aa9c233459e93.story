A man has died in a tragic surfing accident off the coast of Western Australia after he was injured by a surfboard.

The 51-year-old was at Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River when either the nose or fin of his board is said to have damaged the main artery in one of his legs causing massive blood loss.

The father-of-two was dragged ashore by fellow surfers The Daily Telegraph reported, and others on the beach performed CPR on the man for nearly half an hour.

From NSW, the surfer was on holidays in WA with his father, wife, and children, and one witness said the man's elderly father was watching on from the carpark when the grisly scene unfolded.

'You just wouldn't believe it because the swell was 2m, the winds were only light, and Surfers Point is always powerful but it wasn't as powerful as it gets,' Darrly Naidu told The Daily Telegraph, speaking of the horrible circumstances in which the man died.

He also told of how two men brought the 51-year-old to shore after they saw him wipe-out, and found him with blood pooling around him in the water.

Another witness who spoke to the website said the man was losing a lot of blood from what could have been his femoral artery - which is the main supply of blood to the lower half of the body.

St Johns Ambulance paramedics arrived at the scene just after 11am, after reports the man had been injured. 

The 51-year-old was rushed to Margaret River Hospital by emergency services according to the ABC, but died a short time later.

West Australian Police media told Daily Mail Australia a report is being prepared for the coroner.
