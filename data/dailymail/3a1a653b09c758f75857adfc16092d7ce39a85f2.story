A tough fortnight for the Dallas Cowboys ended in the best possible way on Sunday, with a convincing win over the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley.

After two straight defeats by Washington and Arizona, injury problems for quarterback Tony Romo and suggestions that a number of players ‘missed curfew’ on Friday, the Cowboys were back to winning ways.

Dallas’ big players all showed up in London to lead them to a dominant 31-17 victory over Jacksonville in the third and final International Series contest this season.

A banged up Romo, who missed the week-nine loss to Arizona, enjoyed excellent protection from his formidable offensive line as he threw for 246 yards and three touchdowns.

‘Tony played a really good game,’ head coach Jason Garrett said. ‘He saw the field well and took the opportunity to throw the ball down the field. He didn’t look like he had any physical restrictions.’

Romo added: ‘I’m just sore, but it’s always uncomfortable when you get hit. It’s part of playing football and everyone goes through that. I’m a little bang up, but a lot of guys are.

‘We had to win this game and came out with great energy and executed really well.’

Running back DeMarco Murray continued his strong season with yet another 100-yard rushing game while wide receiver Dez Bryant racked up 158 yards and two touchdowns.

It was a victory that ended a two-game losing streak for Dallas and kept up the pressure on NFC East leaders Philadelphia having relinquished control of that division.

If the Cowboys are serious about their play-off hopes, this was a game they could barely afford to lose against a Jacksonville team who have won just once this season.

Garrett said: ‘The big challenge is to focus on the task in hand regardless of what happened the previous week.

‘I thought we did a good job of that and had the right approach, mentality and mindset and it reflected in our performance today.’

Denard Robinson’s 32-yard touchdown run for the Jaguars midway through the first quarter would have had the Cowboys sideline anxiously biting their nails at the prospect of a third straight defeat.

But once the tide turned in Dallas’ favour, it never looked like shifting back again.

Jacksonville’s promising start was undone by a costly mistake on special teams when Ace Sanders made a mess of his punt return.

Sanders dropped the ball on his six-yard line, and Dallas recovered in excellent field position. On 3rd and Goal, Romo took his time and rolled right before finding a wide-open tight end Jason Witten in the end zone.

Once Romo and Co settled down and found their groove, the Jags defense couldn’t stop them.

Bryant helped himself to a pair of touchdowns in the first half, the first time he has recorded multiple scores this season. The first came on a 35-yard pass from Romo with 7:01 remaining in the second quarter, but the second was even bigger.

With 19 seconds to play in the first half, Bryant caught a deep pass from Romo and bounced off tackles before marching all the way to the end zone for a 68-yard reception. It gave Dallas a 24-7 half-time lead, and it was an advantage that Jacksonville never threatened to close.

Cowboys running back Joseph Randle hammered another nail in the Jags coffin early in the third period as he scored on a 40-yard touchdown run with his first rush of the game.

Jacksonville’s desperation was best demonstrated when they attempted to run the ball on 4th and 1 deep in their own territory and came up short.

As was the case last year against the San Francisco 49ers, the Jags were simply outplayed on the night by a better team.

Rookie quarterback Blake Bortles threw for 290 yards but no touchdowns. He almost went a game without throwing an interception until he threw straight into the open arms of Cowboys linebacker Bruce Carter in the fourth period taking his total for the season to 14.

Jacksonville will return to British shores once again in 2015 to take on the Buffalo Bills and hope for better luck them.

Robinson’s second touchdown run of night late in the fourth quarter gave the scoreboard a bit more respectability for the Jags.

With just over six minutes to play and fans heading for an early exit, Romo took a seat on the bench as Dallas’ backup quarterback Brandon Weeden stepped in for the final few plays.

The Cowboys know that tougher tests await them following their bye week, including two games against division rivals Philadelphia. A win against the Jaguars was all that mattered here, though, and it was a job well done.
