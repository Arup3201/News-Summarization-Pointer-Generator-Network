Christopher Dearlove coughed over nurses telling them he had Ebola to try to get a hospital bed

Britain's most prolific 'hospital hopper' has been jailed after shutting down an A&E department  by pretending to have Ebola.

Homeless Christopher Dearlove, 59, was banned from entering any NHS building unless he had a genuine medical problem in 2010 after making up ailments to get a free bed for the night. 

But earlier this year he forced Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby into lock-down after telling nurses he had Ebola, coughing over them and demanding treatment. 

He was jailed at Grimsby Crown Court for 14 months. 

Dearlove, who is an alcoholic, had been drinking for almost four hours when he walked into the Grimsby A&E in February.

The man, who is thought to be homeless, told nurses he had recently returned from West Africa where his wife had died of the disease. 

He claimed he had tested positive for Ebola at Johannesburg airport before coughing over staff. 

Using a false name, he was then heard saying: 'It’s not my fault if everyone becomes infected.' 

Part of the A&E was forced into lock-down as nurses rushed into protective clothing. He was arrested after a member of staff recognised him and phoned the police. 

It is not thought Dearlove received any testing or treatment at the hospital. 

Sentencing, Judge David Tremberg said: 'You gave hard pressed medical services more cause for concern and work. 

'They should not be diverted from genuinely sick and injured patients and not be indulging in your fantasies.

'Claiming Ebola and coughing on people is a particularly unpleasant and unattractive act.'

In carrying out the stunt Dearlove broke an anti-social behaviour order issued in 2010 which banned him from visiting hospitals unless genuinely ill. 

It was imposed after he told nurses at various facilities that he was a haemophiliac with AIDS and coughed up fake blood to get a room. 

On separate occasions he claimed to have been experiencing weight loss, night sweats and pain in his chest in order to be admitted. 

From 2006 the NHS began distributing images of the fraudster to stop A&E departments across the country from admitting him. 

The alcoholic would give a false name and medical history and list symptoms he knew were likely to secure him an isolated room. 

Each of his stints cost between £400 and £1,000 according to the NHS security management service.  

Every time he was admitted. Defending at Grimsby Crown Court, Ernie Lidster said he had a psychiatric disorder.

Dearlove was jailed for 14 months at Grimsby Crown Court (above). In court his lawyer said he had a mental disorder
