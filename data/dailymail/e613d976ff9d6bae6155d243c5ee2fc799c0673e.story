As a young mother buys groceries at a petrol station, a leering pervert reaches his hand beneath the hem of her dress and takes a photograph up her skirt.

Oblivious to the violation, Fallon Fraker continues paying as the peeping tom calmly sidles out of the convenience store towards his getaway motorcycle parked in the forecourt.

A manhunt has now been launched after 
CCTV caught the voyeur taking the picture on his mobile phone at a 
Raceway petrol station in League City, Texas.

Do you know this man? The man followed Fallon Fraker into the shop, after she saw him leaving, and waited menacingly behind her

Ms Fraker said the violation was calculated from the minute she walked through the sliding doors.

'When I was getting out of the car, he was leaving the store,' she said. 'As soon as he saw me walk into the store, he turned around and went back inside.'

Despite his strange behaviour, she said she shrugged it off and kept on shopping.

'He got in line behind me,' Ms Fraker 
said. 'I gave him the opportunity to go in front of me because I wasn't 
ready to check out and he said "oh, no, you go ahead."'

Brazen: The leering pervert reaches his hand beneath the hem of her dress and takes a photograph up her skirt

Shameless: Unable to get the angle he desires, the man leans ever closer to take the picture

Oblivious to what was happening behind her, Ms Fallon continued to pay for her goods as the man positions his camera to get the angle he wants.

Unhappy with his first attempt, he creeps closer to get a better shot.

He was only spotted through the window by two men filling their vehicles outside.

Brave: Once alerted to the crime, Ms Fallon chased the man into the forecourt but he sped away on his motorbike (top of picture)

Lesson: Ms Fraker said she would be more careful in future

Scene: The incident took place at this Raceway petrol station in League City, Texas

Once alerted to the crime, Ms Fallon chased the man and demanded he give her the phone to delete the pictures.

But he fled into the city.

'Ill be a lot more cautious,'she added. 'Ill be keeping an eye out in future'
