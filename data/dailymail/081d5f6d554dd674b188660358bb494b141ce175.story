A federal investigation of an Illinois judge has resulted in heroin and gun charges, authorities announced today, and they come just weeks after one of his colleagues died of a cocaine overdose while the two men were staying in his hunting lodge.

Wearing cutoff shorts and a t-shirt with the slogan 'Bad Is My Middle Name,' St. Clair County Circuit Judge Michael Cook appeared in federal court today, where he pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of possessing heroin and having a 
firearm while being an illegal user of controlled substances.

According to authorities, the offenses occurred on Thursday, and Cook is a drug addict.

Cook already faces scrutiny over the death of his colleague St. Clair County Circuit Judge Joe Christ, who was found dead of a cocaine overdose in Cook's hunting lodge in western Illinois. At the time of his death, Christ and Cook were the only two people in the cabin.

Christ, a 49-year-old father of six, was found dead in a bathroom at the 
lodge near Pleasant Hill, about 65 miles from St. Louis, on the evening 
of March 10 - little more than a week after he was sworn in as a judge.

Pike County, Ill., Coroner Paul Petty
said blood screenings showed there was also alcohol in Christ's system,
and that investigators seized cocaine and paraphernalia from the cabin.
The two judges were the only people staying at the property at the 
time, said Petty, who also serves as sheriff.

Petty told The Associated Press he believes Christ died hours before 
Cook reported finding his body, and the coroner expects the death to be 
ruled accidental.

Cook, 43, has not been charged in Christ's death, but that federal investigation
continues. He remains a judge, though his courthouse office has been 
sealed off as part of the investigation and he has been stripped of his 
docket of hundreds of cases.

During Cook's brief court appearance in East St. Louis Friday, U.S. 
Magistrate Judge Clifford Proud ordered him released on his own 
recognizance on the condition that he attend drug treatment if required 
by court officials, surrender his passport, and avoid firearms and drugs
not prescribed to him.

Brendan Kelly, St. Clair County's
state's attorney and Christ's former boss, said in court motions 
Thursday that he has 'actively assisted in and advanced' the federal 
investigation involving Cook and has filed complaints against the judge 
with state judicial discipline regulators, including the Illinois Supreme Court.

'We're doing whatever we can to get to the bottom of whatever the 
issue is,' said John Baricevic, St. Clair County's chief judge. 'Any 
community has to have confidence in public servants, including judges. 
That they're fair, honest and act with integrity. If they're not, we owe
them an appropriate response.'

A former assistant public defender, Cook became an associate circuit judge in 2007 and was appointed a circuit judge in 2010, then won a six-year term later that year.
