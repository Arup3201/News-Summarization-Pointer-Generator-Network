Friends and family said goodbye to Johran McCormick on Monday, while wearing bow ties and singing along to the tune of American gospel song When the Saints Go Marching In.

They said they had chosen to dress up in bow dies because Johran liked wearing them. In the sky above the church, multi-colored balloons soared in his memory.

The 17-year-old, from Spring near Houston, Texas, was shot dead on Sunday when an unidentified father found the boy in his 16-year-old daughter's room.

Gone too soon: Johran McCormick, 17, was shot dead early Thursday morning after sneaking in to the house of a 16-year-old girl. His sorrowful mother Zakia says she expects the girl's father to call her and apologize

The daughter initially denied knowing Mr McCormick but later admitted that she did know the boy who was in her bed.

A grand jury will now decide whether any charges will be filed against the Texas father who fired one fatal shot at a 17-year-old boy he found in his teenage daughter's bedroom early Thursday morning.

On Sunday, friends and family remembered the boy that they called the bird man at a funeral at Plymouth United Church, Spring.

Tributes were paid to the teenager, one friend told Click2Houston: 'I just miss him, I wish I could hug him one more time.'

Another described him as 'an amazing person'.

'I feel terrible that that had to happen to him,' she said.

Others expressed their views on the father who fired the shot with several friends saying that he should be put behind bars.

Another expressed the anger that he felt towards the daughter who was found in bed with the teenager.

He told the Houston television channel: 'I don't actually think the father should be charged - I think the daughter should be.'

Tributes were paid to the 17-year-old. One friend described him as 'an amazing person' and another said: 'I just miss him, I wish I could hug him'

Bow ties were worn because Johran McCormick used to like wearing them. Friends called him the bird man because he used to joke around making bird noises at high school

As photos of victim Johran McCormick emerged on Friday, his heartbroken family said the least they expect is an apology from the gun-wielding dad, who constables say was on 'several medications' at the time of the incident.

'I would like my baby back, but I know that's not possible,' the victim's mother, Zakia McCormick, told KHOU 11 News.

'I have never ever felt a pain like this. Ever.

'(I want) a call, you know. ''I'm sorry''. He didn't deserve to die that like.'

Bereaved: Zakia McCormick said said she has never experienced such pain after losing her son Johran this week. Police are yet to file any charges

Daddy got his gun: An unidentified father (pictured above on a stretcher) shot dead a 17-year-old boy after finding the teen in bed with his 16-year-old daughter this morning in Spring ,Texas

Authorities have confirmed Johran McCormick, a 17-year-old Klein Collins High School student, was not armed when he was shot

Investigators said the suspect's 16-year-old daughter let the boy into the house. 

The father told police that he was woken up by one of his four children who said someone was in the house, which is located on the 22300 block of Bridgestone Ridge Dr in Spring.

At first, the daughter denied knowing the boy and an argument ensued between the stranger and the father when he wouldn't listen to the father's commands.

When the teen reached for something, the father shot and killed the boy. 

Authorities say the teen was unarmed.

The 16-year-old daughter later admitted to knowing the boy and letting him into the house. 

The father was seen being brought out of the house on a stretcher.

He was transported to hospital with symptoms of a panic attack, according to reports.

A news release from the Harris County 
Sheriff's Office said officers are preparing a case that will be 
presented to the grand jury.
