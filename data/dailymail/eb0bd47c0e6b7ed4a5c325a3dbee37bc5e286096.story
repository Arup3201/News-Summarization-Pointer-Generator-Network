Morgan Schneiderlin could return from injury to face Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday as Southampton prepare to name a 'strong side'.

The France international has not played this month while recovering from a groin injury but could join James Ward-Prowse in the squad, although youngster Jake Hesketh has been ruled out and requires a scan to assess his knee.

After an unexpectedly good start to the season, the Saints have lost their last four Premier League games - against Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Burnley - and manager Ronald Koeman is determined to get back to winning ways.

Koeman told saintsfc.co.uk: 'I'd like to go on doing what we did before, which means we don't make a lot of changes in the team, but of course we have to look at the freshness of the players.

'We won't take a risk because of the programme we have, but we'll play a strong team.

'It's a good possibility that Morgan (Schneiderlin) will be okay for tomorrow.

'We have to see his reaction to today's training session, but we have a good feeling about him.

Manager Ronald Koeman has admitted he will play a 'strong side' against Sheffield United on Tuesday

'Jake (Hesketh) will be out for Tuesday, and then we will have to wait.

'He will have a scan on his knee problem today, and I hope that it's not a tough injury.

'Hopefully it will be okay in a short time.'
