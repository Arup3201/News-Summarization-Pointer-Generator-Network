A British millionaire has told how golfing legend Lee Westwood saved him from drowning off the island of Barbados.

Colin Davies, a businessman from Solihull in the West Midlands, said the Ryder Cup star rushed to his aid after he got into difficulty in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday.

He said the former world number one, who is currently holidaying on the island with his wife Laurae, heard his screams and dived into the water to help.

Mr Davies said Westwood, who is holidaying on the island (above) with his wife Laurae, heard his cry for help and dived into the water to help. He was later brought ashore where beach-goers pointed out the famous face

The former Staffordshire miner, who suffers from Parkinson's Disease, said he was now desperate to thank Nottinghamshire-born Westwood.

He told the Birmingham Mail: 'If there is a power looking over us, I hope he takes note and delivers three Majors to this kind and gentle human being.

'I have Parkinson's disease so to enter the sea was foolhardy or stupid.

'As soon as I entered I realised I was in trouble. My legs wouldn't move, and my wife Laurae was out of earshot.

'The family next to us on the beach heard my cry and within a second a muscular male grabbed me and, with tremendous but gentle care, got me back to my lounge bed.'

Although in his state of shock Mr Davies did not realise that the muscular man in question was Westwood, others on the beach were quick to point out the famous face.

The 41-year-old golfer, who made eight Ryder Cup appearances and was named player of the year in 1998, 2000 and 2009, now lives in Palm Beach, Florida.

The father of two is currently holidaying in Barbados with his wife and has posted several pictures online of his Caribbean break.

Mr Davies said he was unable to personally thank Westwood after being rescued due to the commotion, but is now searching the beaches on the island to find the golfer and show his gratitude.

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Lee Westwood for comment.
