Suspect: Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after four guns and nearly 50 bombs were found in his vehicle during a traffic stop Monday

A man stopped for speeding in central Ohio was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after nearly 50 bombs and four guns were discovered in his vehicle.

Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was arrested late New Year's Day on Interstate 70 west of Columbus.

Investigators found two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosive devices and tools and materials to make additional explosives. Also inside was a remote detonating device, Assistant Madison County Prosecutor Nick Adkins said.

Officials are trying to determine why the man had the cache of weapons and bombs. He is being held on $1million bond pending a court hearing Friday in Madison County.

According to the state trooper who stopped him for going 85mph in a 70mph zone, Boguslawski said he had no weapons.

However, the officer returned with a ticket and saw the handle of a gun between the man's knees.

‘At that point, he drew his service weapon, held the man there and called for backup,’ said Adkins.Boguslawski told authorities he has an attorney, but none was listed on the court docket.

Adkins said a $1million bond set for the defendant reflected the possible risk to the public.

Boguslawski was stopped on I-70 in Madison County just before midnight on New Year's Day for going about 15mph over the speed limit. 

Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper William Davis asked the driver if he had any weapons in his vehicle after spotting a bumper sticker on Boguslawski's car that read: 'If you can read this, you’re in range,' The London Madison-Press reported.

The 43-year-old man lied that he was unarmed, but when the trooper returned with his ticket, Boguslawski was clutching a gun with his knees.

After additional officers arrived on the scene, Boguslawski's car was searched, yielding an arsenal of two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosives and bomb-making paraphernalia.

'Most concerning to me was that they found a remote detonating device,' said Adkins.

According to Adkins, Boguslawski works at a training facility for Navy SEALS in Indiana. At the time of his arrest, the suspect was carrying blueprints for buildings that are part of his workplace.

The prosecutor said investigators are trying to determine if Boguslawski has ties to any known terrorist organizations.
