Thomas Muller has been told by Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge he needs to ask if he wants to leave for Manchester United this summer.

According to reports in German newspaper Bild, the forward would be open to joining Louis van Gaal's revolution at Old Trafford this summer in a move worth £37million.

Van Gaal was the manager who installed Muller as a first-team regular at Bayern during the 2009-2010 season and the prospect of a reunion would tempt the Germany  forward.

But first he needs to persuade the club's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to sell him. Rummenigge told Bild: 'If a player does not feel comfortable with Bayern Munich, he must come to my office. Then you have to talk about it.'

Muller, 24, has started 24 Bundesliga and eight Champions League matches this season but has only completed the full 90 minutes in 18 of these and reportedly considers this insufficient for a World Cup year.

He passed up the opportunity to commit his future to the German champions, replying, 'No comment, no comment' in English when quizzed on his future by Bild. Muller added: 'I do not comment on rumours.'

Muller has scored 25 goals this season, including one against United in the quarter-final, second leg of the Champions League.

He is contracted to the defending European champions until 2017 and it would take a bid in the region of €45million (£37m) to convince Bayern to sell.

United will reportedly have as much as £200m to spend this summer as they attempt to re-build their squad and reputation following a disastrous season under David Moyes.

Shortlist: Toni Kroos would also interest United if Bayern were willing to sell the talented midfielder

Wanted man: United also have an eye on Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus

Van Gaal is the heavy favourite to take over after his duties with Holland at the World Cup and has earmarked a number of German players he wants to bring to United.

Muller is alongside Bayern team-mate Toni Kroos, while Borussia Dortmund players Mats Hummels and Marco Reus have also been linked.
