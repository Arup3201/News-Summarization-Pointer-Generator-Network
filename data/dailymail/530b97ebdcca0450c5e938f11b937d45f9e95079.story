Diego Costa up against Thiago Silva is a mouthwatering prospect: one of the world’s best strikers versus one of the game’s best defenders.

I watched Silva a lot at the World Cup for Brazil and he was immense. When he was missing, they lost 7-1 to Germany in the semi-final.

Silva is an aggressive and brave defender who attacks the ball well. He’s not the tallest at barely 6ft but that gives him extra mobility.

Diego Costa has been in formidable form for Chelsea since signing from Atletico Madrid last summer

Thiago Silva is one of the most respected defenders in world football and will try to stop Costa on Tuesday

He’s good on the ball and is not afraid to bring it out from the back. Also, when opponents try to put pressure on him he will find a way out with a bit of skill. He makes it look easy.

He is a threat in the opposing penalty area too but hasn’t scored for Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 or Europe for more than a year so he will know that needs to improve.

Perhaps Silva’s biggest weakness is the league he is playing in. Ligue 1 does not offer enough of a regular test for PSG’s players so all of a sudden facing someone as brilliant as Costa could be a shock to the system.

He and his central defensive partner David Luiz will want to show they are capable of stopping Chelsea, the competition’s highest scorers so far.

Luiz’s professional pride will have been wounded when Chelsea sold him so he also has a big point to prove.

But he and Silva will leave space in behind as they like to bring the ball out, and that could give Chelsea opportunities.

Maybe they can get a hold of Costa but that might just leave space for Eden Hazard or Willian to run in behind. Costa can be the decoy.

And as if the tactical battle isn’t enough, Costa switching nationality from Brazil to Spain will add even more spice.

Silva has already said he wouldn’t do the same and probably wondered how well Brazil could have done in the World Cup with Costa in their side. Get ready for some niggles.
