Thieves who stole a precious parrot which loves to belt out Queen songs are 'under pressure' to return her.  

Eight-year-old Chico likes to squawk famous lines such as 'Gallileo, Gallileo' and ‘Scaramouche’ after she learned the lyrics by listening to a greatest hits CD.

The red-tailed African grey, who was stolen from Malcolm Booth's
 home in Hattersley, Greater Manchester on Sunday, also loves the rock group's famous tracks ‘We are the Champions' and 'Killer Queen.'

Now 44-year-old Mr Booth hopes Chico's renditions will drive her captors round the bend and hand her back. 

Chico time: The African grey parrot was stolen from his cage during a burglary

Mr Booth who has had the bird since she was a three-week old baby said she would be making quite a flap.

He said: 'I’m a great fan of Queen and am used to Chico squawking and whistling their tunes but I’m not sure its everyone’s cup of tea.

'I don’t think the people who have her will appreciate her squawking ‘Scaramouche’, ‘Gallileo’ and ‘I’m just a poor boy’ at them all the time. In fact I think it will drive them up the wall.

'Chico loves her music and whenever I put her in her cage I always put the music channel on for her.'

Cage flighter: Owner Malcolm Booth is desperate to get his beloved pet parrot Chico returned safely

The father of two, bought his beloved pet from a breeder when his Timneh Grey parrot passed away.

He has spent eight years training her to speak, sing and perform tricks at the home he shares with son, Kieran, 13.

The clever polly can recognise colours and put them into the correct boxes as well as playing football, saying please and thank you and squawking out the names of family members.

Mr Booth added: 'Chico’s a bit of a handful but she’s a well loved family pet. She will tell my son off if he’s been naughty and if a girl comes in she’ll do a wolf whistle.

'She wouldn’t bite because she’s hand-reared. Mostly it’s just a little nip but then she’ll lick you. If she wants feeding, it’s ‘Malc please’.

'I only called her Chico because she was cheeky when she first came. At the time I paid £650 for her, but now she’s talking and doing tricks she’s worth up to £900-£1000.

Feathery fan: Chico loves to whistle Queen songs performed by the late Freddie Mercury

Mr Booth said he was doing some gardening at his brother-in-law’s when Chico disappeared on Sunday afternoon, and he believes that the thieves broke into the empty house after Kieran and Malcolm’s older son, Christian, 17, accidentally left the kitchen window open while cooking.

The offenders escaped with a Playstation 3 and the parrot after breaking open the door of its cage.

Malcolm added: 'She is normally in a cage. If I had left her out, they wouldn’t have caught her because she wouldn’t have come to them unless they shouted her name.'

He added: ' I don’t need an alarm clock in this house 
because she’s shouting Kieran at 5-6am, and it’s not quiet.

'It’s a four-bedroom house and when I’m in the far bedroom I can hear her with the door shut.'

Mr Booth is appealing to the public for 
any information that can help return his pet to him.

He said: 'All I want is my bird back. The person that stole it can bring it back and I’ll give them the rest of my games that they’ve missed. They can keep the PS3, I’m not bothered, my bird was a family member.'

Detective Constable Barbara Offord at Greater Manchester Police said: 'Many people forge strong relationships with their pets and this case is no exception. Chico is a much loved member of the family and they are desperate for his return.
