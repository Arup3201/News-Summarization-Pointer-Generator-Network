Eyewitness Adam Taylor, 29 said: 'To be honest I didn't see it at first. I was wondering why the car in front had suddenly stopped.

'Then I saw what I thought was an albino ostrich and a women trying to shepherd it back towards her house.

'I thought, "well that's something you don't see everyday".

'The owner managed to grab it but it shed a few feathers escaping her grasp, and then ran off stopped and turned by my car.

'I thought about getting out and helping but wasn't sure how safe a choice that was, as I was unsure if it was dangerous or not.

'I've seen ostriches before at Longleat and assumed this was the same.'

The
 bird's owner, who did not want give his name, said: 'It's a male bird 
and unfortunately he has taken a dislike to me so when I went to get the
 post yesterday afternoon he just burst at me.

'He made a dash for it through the open gate and that was it. Unfortunately this time of year males can be really feisty and that's what happened.

'It
 wouldn't ever hurt anyone else, they are lovely creatures, my 
10-year-old can play with them just fine, it's just me he doesn't like. He made a run for it down the road and we had to wait for the police to corner it and bring it back.'

He added: 
'I used to own lots of Rhea, I had them on my farm, they are lovely 
birds. I'm in the process of selling off the house so I'm selling off 
the birds too, this was my last one.

'They are a South American bird and they keep them rather than sheep, they really are lovely.'

Police officers spent three hours chasing the bird.

An earlier escaped rhea in Hertfordshire, pictured, was shot dead and turned into sausages

Baffled residents could not believe their eyes when they spotted an exotic bird - running riot in a quiet town centre.

Police
 called nearby Longleat Safari Park thinking that the Rhea may have 
escaped from the estate, but they said all animals were accounted for.

Rita the Rhea, escaped from a small holding owned by Jo Clark in Starling's Green in Essex in mid-March.

The giant bird was running wild for more than a month when it was eventually shot in the head by gamekeeper Stuart Howe.

Mr Howe said he saw the bird 70 yards away in a rape seed field near Royston, Hertfordshire.

After shooting Rita, Mr Howe said he was going to turn her into gourmet sausages.

The giant white flightless bird was eventually cornered in a back garden in Warminster, where its owner came to pick it up.

Sergeant Jim Suter, Sector Sergeant for Trowbridge and Bradford-on-Avon, informed followers of the strange chase on Twitter.

'Police responding to report of Ostrich running through #Warminster High Street,' he tweeted.

'The Ostrich turned out to be a Rea located rear of #Warminster hospital and returned to owner.'

Local Kate Preece wrote on Twitter: 'It was BIG, long neck & legs carrying it at break neck speed down the road! I was scared it would be killed!'

Jamie 
Wilkins said: 'I'm a little concerned. My wife is out with friends 
tonight and there's reports of an ostrich running through Warminster.'

He later added: 'The people of Warminster can relax. It wasn't an ostrich it was a rhea. It was cornered behind the hospital.'Grace
 Dickins wrote: 'Just seen picture evidence that there is indeed a loose
 emu or rhea running around Warminster High Street.'

Fully-grown rheas can weigh up to 80lb, exceed 6ft in height and run as fast as 40mph.

The spur on their heel is as big as their claws and they can kick with a force of 800lb per square inch.
