The only thing worse than going back to school after a relaxing summer is watching a commercial about it deemed 'the worst commercial ever' by internet viewers. Or is it?

A 30-second commercial for East Hills Shopping Center in St. Joseph, Missouri was posted on YouTube on Saturday and so far has over one million views.

Though many YouTube users think the commercial is 'terrible,' it's managed to go viral almost overnight, reports ABC.

The opening: A girl sings the name of the mall off-key in the beginning of the 'terrible' commercial

Great casting: Employees of the mall hold up items like 'denim' which can be purchased at the shopping center

The commercial starts with a little girl singing about back to school shopping at East Hills Shopping Center.

It then shows several of the mall's employees holding up various back to school items featured in the shopping center.

'Denim,' says on employee as she holds up a pair of the season's newest blue jeans.

'Haircuts,' sings a punk-rock looking employee as she gives the camera her most operatic voice.

'Backpacks! Backpacks! Come get your backpacks!' says a perky blonde employee.

'Boots and pants,' says a mall worker with spiked blonde hair.

Singing praise: This woman sings 'haircuts' in her best operatic voice

Classic staple: 'Backpacks,' exclaims a perky blonde to the camera

'Shoes!' screeches another employee.

'Get yourself an outfit,' says a woman in case the viewers didn't realize that the mall sells multiple items of clothing.

The local advertisement may have amused some and annoyed others but either way it has gained international attention.

'Americans are good at making everything terrible,' said user Rage Smith.

'I don't know what to do. Am I supposed to dislike this, or like it? I dislike it with a passion, but that's the point so do I like it?' said Aaron Tripp.

'I don't think it's a "terrible" commercial when it goes viral and 1'000'000 end up watching it,' said XxDarkLightWolfxX.

Great combo: 'Boots and pants,' exclaims a male store staff member

Step in the right direction: 'Shoes,' advertises this vivacious mall staff member

Sales boost?: It's hard to say whether or not the commercial will boost sales at the mall but considering the large number of viewers it's promising

'What an innovative form of marketing. Reverse psychology, I wanna go there to get my boots and pants,' said JamEcrivain.

The mall's general manager Caroline Thalasinos spoke with NBC on Monday morning and said that the commercial was intended to be extremely 'lightheaded and funny.'

'It was extremely catchy and even though it was extremely funny, I knew a lot of people might take it seriously, and I mean, we had no idea that it was going to go viral but I knew that we were going to get attention for it and that’s what the main goal was,' she added.

Thalasinos told reporters it's too soon to tell if the commercial will boosts sales but it has certainly gotten the public's attention.'When they do think of back to school shopping .... They’re going to think of East Hills Shopping Center, and I think that’s great,' she said.
