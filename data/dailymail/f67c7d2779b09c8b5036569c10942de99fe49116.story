A Chinese man is urging officials to toughen up animal protection laws after discovering local children had been using fireworks to play a sick form of Angry Birds with live sparrows.

The children trapped the birds in a variety of ways - including using catapults to knock them down - before strapping the stunned or injured birds to fireworks, lighting them and sending them into the air to explode.

The sick game was discovered by Huang Chu, 45, from Lantian county in north-western China's Shaanxi province, after he spotted children running away from something in a local park.

He investigated and discovered it was an unexploded firework.

He said: 'I realised it was not going to go off as the fuse had run out, but when I went to walk past it I saw there was a sparrow tied to the side of the firework.

'I took a picture and then I set it free, and it flapped off under a bush.'

He  then spoke to  people in the park - where the children had been setting off fireworks all morning - and found several more bloodied and mutilated dead birds which had already been torn apart by the fireworks.

He said: 'I spoke to an older boy who told me that the others had been playing Angry Birds, shooting the fireworks across the park and pretending to be playing the video game of the same name.'

The children said they were pretending to play popular video game Angry Birds (pictured) - but with real birds

Angry Birds is a popular video game franchise played primarily on mobile phones.

In it, the player must fling a wingless bird at a pig’s fortress in order to gain points and get through to the next round.

Mr Chu added: 'I posted images online because people should be aware of what's happening and maybe it will increase pressure for animal rights laws to finally be introduced here in China.'
