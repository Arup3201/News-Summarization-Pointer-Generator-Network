A U.S. tourist detained in Aruba in the death of his travel companion has cooperated with investigators and should be immediately released because there is no evidence against him, his defence lawyer said today.

Michael Lopez, the Aruban lawyer for Gary Giordano, denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer answering questions about what happened to Robyn Gardner, his companion on a short trip to the Dutch Caribbean island.

Giordano, a 50-year-old business owner from Gaithersburg, Maryland, has granted four interviews to investigators and accompanied them twice on visits to the area where he said Gardner disappeared while they went snorkeling, Lopez said in a written statement.

Suspect: Former wives and girlfriends have complained of how Gary Giordano could become angry and controlling

'To date, our client has given all 
possible cooperation to the investigation,' he said. 'Where our client 
has been asked the same question more than once he referred to previous 
statements.'

Giordano is scheduled to appear before a judge Monday for a detention hearing.

Prosecutors plan to ask that he be 
held for at least eight more days while authorities continue to 
investigate what happened to Gardner.

Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein has said that investigators believe the 35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, is dead.

'We cannot deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client,' Lopez said.

The claims from Giordano's lawyer 
comes as former wives and girlfriends told how he could not control his 
anger and stalked them, even allegedly hiding outside one lover's house 
dressed as a deer.

Previous lovers have told how he 
courted them with his blue-green eyes, tall physique and offers of 
cruises and vacations, and his $1.3 million stone mansion in an 
upper-class Washington DC suburb.

Giordano, a self-employed businessman and twice-divorced father of three sons, has denied any wrongdoing since the disappearance of Ms Gardner, who authorities now believe is dead.

Her remains have not been found, despite four days of searching the area where Giordano told officials an ocean current pulled her away as they snorkelled on August 2.

Federal involvement: FBI agents searched Giordano's home in Gaithersburg, Maryland on Friday evening

FBI agents combed through Giordano's Gaithersburg, Maryland, home last night.

Yesterday,
solicitor general Taco Stein said a pink shirt and black sandals found 
during a search of an abandoned phosphate mine - near where Giordano 
told authorities Gardner disappeared - did not belong to the woman.

Giordano has told authorities that Ms Gardner never made it back to shore after the two became separated.

The exact nature of their relationship is not clear, and she had a boyfriend at home in Maryland.

Police
said they doubt certain aspects of his story, including whether the 
pair went into the water, and say they're seeking witnesses to build 
their case against him.

Court
records and former romantic interests reveal a man who could be 
threatening and who has had several volatile relationships.

'He can't control his anger,' his first wife, Sharon Cohen, wrote in court papers in 2001.

Search: Police said clothes found in the shaft of an old phosphate mine near Baby Beach, Aruba, did not belong to the missing woman

Giordano married Cohen in 1987 and they had three sons, but the relationship deteriorated until they divorced in 2003.

At one point, each accused the other 
of abuse, with Giordano alleging that his wife struck him in the back 
with a steel cooking spoon during a heated argument.

She countered that he had a nasty temper, throwing phones, cursing and becoming violent with one of their sons.

Giordano apparently struggled with relationships after his first marriage ended.

He and his second wife divorced in 2008 after just two years.

In the last three years, other women he dated - many of them thin and blond like Ms Gardner - found that their romantic relationships with him turned ugly.

One woman accused him of threatening her by saying 'the world would be better off without me' and of secretly videotaping their sexual encounters.

The woman met with prosecutors, but told authorities she didn't want to pursue the case.

She claimed in court documents that Giordano retaliated by putting revealing photos of her in neighbours' mailboxes.

Jeanette Farago, a former neighbour, started dating Giordano around the time of his second divorce.

She said Giordano was charismatic but could become angry and possessive, though she said she never felt physically threatened.

Once, he wanted to take her on a cruise but became irate when she didn't want to go, she said, a situation Ms Gardner also found herself in, according to a friend.

Farago said Giordano insisted on having her email password so he could ensure she was not seeing anyone else.

If
she said she was going to the grocery store, he would want photographic
proof. Sometimes, she said, he would spy on her and text her details of
her outfit so she knew he was watching.

He even hid in the woods behind her home to watch her, dressing in a deer costume, she said.

'He's Mr Perfect,' she said, and then he's 'totally different'.

Giordano and Ms Gardner, who is from Frederick, Maryland, arrived in Aruba on July 31 and shared a room at a Marriott hotel.

Investigators have surveillance tape of them at a restaurant near Baby Beach, not far from where he says she disappeared while snorkelling. But no witnesses saw them go into the water and police have no knowledge of what else they did on the island.

Under Aruban law, which is based on the Dutch legal system, the judge can extend the next detention order for a maximum of eight days at a hearing scheduled for Monday.

After that period, prosecutors could ask a judge to order Giordano held for as long as 60 days while they prepare a case, but that would require more substantial evidence. Charges would be filed at the end of the 60 days if prosecutors take the case to court.

Aruba has experience dealing with missing person cases following the still unsolved disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway during a high school class trip to the island in 2005.

Her remains were never found and the main suspect, Joran van der Sloot, is in jail in Peru on charges of killing a 21-year-old woman last May.
