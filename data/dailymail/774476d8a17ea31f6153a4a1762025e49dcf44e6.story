Burnley have announced the signing of former Blackburn defender Steven Reid on a one-year deal.

The 33-year-old was a free agent after being released by Albion at the end of last season but will stay in the Premier League after moving to Turf Moor.

The Premier League veteran, of 185 top flight appearances across spells at The Hawthorns and seven seasons with Blackburn, is Burnley's fifth signing of an already busy summer window.

And manager Sean Dyche decided to swoop for Reid after playing alongside the Republic of Ireland international at Millwall.

'Steven is a very strong minded professional,' Dyche said. 'He has had years in the Premier League so he has that bit of experience and know how.

'I know him personally from his younger days at Millwall and he was a very solid pro then and he still is now, perhaps a more rounded version of what he was then.

'Along with Matty Taylor we want that experience in the building as well as the vibrancy in the team.

'Both of 
those players played in some really awkward games for West Brom and West
 Ham respectively and hopefully that experience can rub off on others.'

Reid follows Michael Kightly, Matt Gilks, Marvin Sordell and Matt Taylor in joining the Clarets - who will be looking to secure safety in the Premier League having been relegated immediately after their last promotion in 2009.

The 33-year-old began his professional career with Millwall before moving to Burnley's east Lancashire rivals Blackburn in 2003.

He spent seven years at Ewood Park but had brief loan spells at QPR and West Brom before making a permanent move to The Hawthorns in 2010.
