If Harry Redknapp needed a reminder of how cruel the Premier League can be, this was it.

Queens Park Rangers could have been 2-0 up at half time against Hull, but seven minutes into the second half they were on their way to defeat thanks to James Chester’s winner.

Chester - escaping the attentions of debutant Rio Ferdinand in the process - headed home the only goal of the afternoon as Steve Bruce's side got their season up and running.

And to compound QPR's misery, Charlie Austin missed a late penalty for Harry Redknapp's side as their latest top-flight journey began with defeat.

Man of the Match: Robertson  

‘Some days it doesn’t go with you, if we score the penalty we could have won the game — that’s how close it was,’ said Redknapp.

‘I felt we played better today than the majority of the Championship season last year, we will only get better.’ 

Ferdinand made his QPR debut, playing as the sweeper in Redknapp's new-look 3-5-2 formation. Alongside him was Richard Dunne, who was making his return to the top-flight, and Caulker, who was making his first competitive start for Rangers following his move from Cardiff.

Jordon Mutch, also an arrival from Cardiff, made his debut but Redknapp didn't include loan signing Mauricio Isla who is still receive international clearance.

Striker Loic Remy, who spent lost season on loan at Newcastle, also started for Rangers after his protracted moves to Liverpool and Arsenal fell through.

There were also three debutantes for Hull, Andrew Robertson, Robert Snodgrass and Tom Ince all making their bows for Bruce's side.

Both club's started with the 'on-trend' 3-5-2 system; Ferdinand assuming the role as sweeper in the heart of QPR's defence.

But it was Hull that looked comfortable as they dominated the opening exchanges.

Nikica Jelavic glanced a header wide from Robertson's deep cross before the home side struggled to deal with Snodgrass' inswinging corner.

Slowly but surely, though, Redknapp's men eased their way back into Premier League life.

Austin just failed to find Mutch during a rapid QPR break, before Ale Faurlin fired narrowly wide in the 17th minute after a period of sustained pressure from the top-flight new-boys.

Austin did find Mutch five minutes later after Hull keeper Allan McGregor went walkabout - but QPR's summer signing completely missed his kick from 14 yards out.

Curtis Davies was booked in the 27th minute for a crude foul on Remy, who turned the defender on the edge of the box, only for Joey Barton - captaining the side in Clint Hill's absence - to fire wide.

                       MINS PLD    KM       MILES 

QPR total                           112.8       70.1

Joey Barton    90               12.3        7.6

Jordon Mutch  90              12.3        7.6

Loic Remy         90             10.9         6.8

Hull City total                      117.1      72.8

Jake Livermore  90             12.1       7.5

Nikica Jelavic     90              11.8       7.3

Tom Huddlestone   90         11.6       7.2

Mutch then missed a glorious chance to score QPR's first goal of the season, but he could only head wide from eight yards after Remy's excellent cross.

And the home side could easily have been punished for their wastefulness seconds later when Armand Traore clumsily bundled Jelavic over in the box, but referee Craig Pawson waved away Hull's appeals.

Rangers were fortunate, and Ferdinand knew it, as he gave Traore an earful immediately after the incident.

Snodgrass' début came to an abrupt end in the 40th minute, a knee injury ending his afternoon.

And it nearly got worse for last season's FA Cup finalists after Caulker's bullet header from Barton's inswinging corner was cleared off the line by Robertson before McGregor tipped the loose ball over the bar. 

On balance, a goal wouldn't have flattered Rangers, who after a slow start got to grips with the Premier League pretty quickly.

But, as is life in the big-time, QPR paid the consequences for the wastefulness as Hull took a 52nd minute lead.

Stephen Quinn's inswinging corner was headed past Rob Green by Chester after the Hull defender escaped the attentions of Ferdinand at the back post.

If Redknapp needed a reminder of how cruel the Premier League is, then that was it.

And Hull should have doubled their lead in the 62nd minute after a flowing break, but Ince could only fire straight at Green with just the keeper to beat after brilliant work from Quinn. 

Redknapp introduced Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips to stem the visitors' impetus - but the chances kept coming for Hull.

Redknapp introduced Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips to stem the visitors' impetus - but the chances kept coming for Hull. 

First, Ince forced Green into another save in the 70th minute, the QPR keeper palming his fierce free kick behind before the Hull forward was thwarted again, this time by Dunne's timely block.

Jelavic saw his volley from Quinn's corner deflected over in the 74th minute as Hull squandered another opportunity.

And with every passing chance, Bruce was getting twitchier.

So, it would have come as no surprise to the Hull boss when referee Pawson pointed to the spot in the 83rd minute after Chester handled substitute Junior Hoilett's attempted cross.

Under pressure: Jordan Mutch of QPR attempts to try and get away from Hull's Tom Huddlestone during the first-half of the match

But QPR's first half deficiencies were laid bare again when Austin's 84th minute penalty was superbly saved by McGregor.

That just about summed up QPR's afternoon. Redknapp's side tried to muster a late onslaught, Remy and substitute Bobby Zamora wasting good chances as Hull held on for victory. 

Bruce was satisfied with the result as he set out Hull's target for Premier League survival.  

‘That’s one win down, we just need to get another nine,’ said Bruce. 'Ten wins is usually enough to keep you up. It sounds easy doesn’t it?’
