The story of how her husband curled up next to her in bed while she was wracked with depression after her multiple sclerosis diagnosis still makes Ann Romney well up with tears.

The wife of the Republican presidential candidate, who will be formally nominated at the party's convention tomorrow, opened up in an unusually personal interview about her relationship with her husband Mitt.

Ann, 63, is frequently cited as her husband's secret weapon as she helps to humanize Mr Romney, who faces continued criticisms of being stiff and unapproachable.

In the interview with CNN which aired Monday evening, Mrs Romney told of how he helped support her after she was diagnosed with the incurable disease in 1998.

'Even when I was as sick as that he would curl up in the bed with me,' she said, pausing to wipe away tears.

'So, you just knew that that was where he was. It was like he was gonna do anything he could do just to say "I'm here. You're OK. Just stay right there, and we'll be OK."'

During the program, entitled 'Romney Revealed: Family, Faith and the Road To Power', the couple's eldest son Tagg reflected on that time in their marriage.

'It was a tough moment for both of them. It was interesting to see the way he treated her as they went through that,' the 42-year-old Romney said.

'Very caring, very loving, very frustrating for him not to be able to step in and fix it. But they drew even closer.'

Mrs Romney also told of how the couple transitioned from their dark period immediately after her diagnosis to the next big step in her husband's professional life: running the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002.

'(Olympic organizers) called me instead of Mitt because they knew Mitt would turn them down flat,' she said, continuing to paint a more developed picture of her husband's devotion.

Eventually the mother-of-five wore down his rejection and he agreed to organize the Games.

At campaign rallies, Mrs Romney has repeatedly told the story of how she told Mitt that there was 'no way' she was going to go through another presidential campaign again.

In response, Mitt gamefully replied 'You know what, Ann, you said that after every pregnancy.'

Mrs Romney's 42 per cent favorability rating, as compared to her 24 per cent unfavorable rating, should help her husband during the nationally televised GOP convention when she takes the stage Tuesday evening.
