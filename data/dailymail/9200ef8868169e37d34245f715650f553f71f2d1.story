Sergio Perez was left holding his wing mirror during practice for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix.

The bizarre incident took place on the opening morning of practice with just 20 minutes gone after the Mexican's left wing mirror broke free at turn four.

Perez managed to grab the faulty wing mirror after it entered his cockpit - which narrowly missed his helmet - before returning to the Force India garage.

The former McLaren driver, who reported the fault over the team radio, had to driver the remainder of the lap with one hand.

'Well, that'll take some attention in the pits,' Force India wrote on 
their Twitter page. 'Just a quick fix for Sergio Perez and he'll be 
straight back on track!'

Perez, who scored Force India's first podium since 2009 at April's Bahrain Grand Prix, ended the opening session in ninth place with a time of 1:28.779 â€“ 1.6 seconds adrift of pacesetter Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes.

Despite signs of improvement for McLaren in Spain after Button posted the second fastest time on Friday morning, the Briton fears Mercedes will face little opposition to their current dominance before Formula One's summer break.

With Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, fifth quickest on Friday morning, at the wheel, Mercedes have so far crushed the opposition, claiming all four poles, race victories, as well as leading every lap.

'Mercedes don't have any competition. They are so far in front of the field,' said Button.

'In Monaco (in a fortnight) you might see Red Bull be strong and give them a run for their money, but apart from that it's going to be very tricky for anyone to challenge them over the next six or seven races.

'Mercedes will also keep developing throughout the year, and whilst we - and every other team - is trying to catch up, they're not going to stand still. They're going to upgrade the car.'
