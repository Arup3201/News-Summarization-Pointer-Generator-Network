Borussia Dortmund had to settle for a point after they were held to a second successive Bundesliga draw at home to Cologne on Saturday.

A win would have sent Jurgen Klopp’s side just one point behind ninth placed Werder Bremen, but they were unable to take advantage against a resolute Cologne.

Cologne won their first came since January last weekend and they followed it up with a strong performance against a resurgent Dortmund.

It had looked like it was going to be an action packed Bundesliga battle as Brazilian Deyverson beat the hosts’ defence before failing to capitalise on his chance.

Moments later Dortmund had the chance to punish Cologne’s inability to take their chances but failed themselves as defender Neven Subotic headed over.

However, that was the end of the action as the visitors installed a deep defensive line as Klopp’s side began to try and probe their opposition.

Dortmund’s inability to break down a stubborn Cologne defence was not helped when Henrikh Mkhitaryan suffered what looked to be a painful injury.

He was replaced by Jakub Blaszczykowski on the hour mark and is now a doubt for the Champions League clash with Juventus later this week.

Blaszczykowski himself failed to find the key to unlock the Cologne defence and Klopp’s side were forced to settle for a second successive Bundesliga draw.
