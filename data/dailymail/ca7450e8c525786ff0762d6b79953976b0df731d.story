NASCAR's 'bad boy' Kurt Busch says he was naked and sobbing on the floor of his motorhome after having a spiritual experience watching Brad Pitt in 'Seven Years in Tibet' when his ex-girlfriend burst in with her young son.

Busch took the stand in his own defense on Wednesday at a hearing for a protective order that Patricia Driscoll filed against him. 

He admitted to grabbing her face and telling her to leave him alone, but says her claims that he smashed her head into the wall three times and strangled her in September is a 'fabrication.'

He said he was stark naked when Discroll barged into his motorhome in Dover, Delaware, with her young son and demanded that he tell the boy to his face that his relationship with Driscoll was over.

NASCAR champion Kurt Busch described being naked on the floor and sobbing after watching Brad Pitt in 'Seven Years in Tibet' following his loss in a race in Dover, Delaware

Patricia Driscoll says she fears for her safety and alleges that Busch choked her and smashed her head against the wall of his trailer

Busche denies that he smashed Driscoll's head and says she is seeking revenge after he broke up with her 

The hearing in a Dover, Delaware, court took a turn for the bizarre on Wednesday - and it wasn't just Busch's testimony. 

Driscoll's attorney later called Busch's personal assistant to the stand who testified that the racer's 37-year-old ex has been prone to telling 'far-fetched stories.' 

Michael Doncheff says Driscoll claimed she a 'trained assassin' and once ranted: 'NASCAR is nothing. I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.'

Mr Doncheff also recalled how the weekend before the confrontation in Delaware, he noticed that Driscoll was moving gingerly and appeared stiff. When he asked her what was wrong, she told him that she had been picked up by a big man and slammed to the ground while helping 'round up' illegal immigrants at the Mexican border. 

Driscoll works as a narcotics and homeland security consultant and lobbyist at a small Washington defense contractor called Frontline Defense Systems. She is also the head of a small charity that helps wounded veterans.

Busch said he wasn't depressed after a race loss - he was just having a spiritual experience watching 'Seven Years in Tibet'

Busch says Driscoll dragged her young son along to his trailer and told the NASCAR racer to tell the boy to his face that he had broken up with her

Dover police say they are still investigating the September 26 incident, but have made no arrests. Driscoll waited six weeks to report the assault. 

Driscoll says she fears for her safety and testified on Tuesday: 'I don't know what he's capable of doing.'

Busch has hired a team of attorneys, who have denied the accusation and portrayed Driscoll as a scorned lover seeking to ruin Busch's career.

Busch testified that he was naked the entire time that Driscoll and her son were in the motorhome.

The man known in NASCAR circles for a bad-boy image that has earned him the nickname 'The Outlaw' also testified that he had been crying earlier that night while watching 'Seven Years in Tibet,' a 1997 movie starring Brad Pitt.

'It was a moving experience... It was a spiritual movie,' Busch explained, adding that the movie led him to reflect on his own life. 

'There were some tearjerker moments.'

The elegant blonde sobbed in court as she described the alleged attack and also asked that Busch undergo psychological evaluation

Busch's legal team says the racer will be cleared of all wrongdoing after a thorough investigation of the facts behind the case 

In a text to Driscoll that night, Busch told her that he was crying, lying on the floor and didn't know 'which way was up.'

In another text that night, Busch told Driscoll 'I don't love anything right now.'

Driscoll testified that she became concerned about Busch after seeing the texts and went to check on him, thinking she and her son could comfort him.

Driscoll and Busch both testified about an angry exchange following a race in New Hampshire, one week before Dover. 

It resulted in him damaging a rental car and her driving off, leaving him stranded at a Boston airport. She also said she tried to reach out to Busch's mother after the New Hampshire race, saying Busch was drinking and struggling with depression.

Busch testified that he told Driscoll 'bye forever' after New Hampshire but acknowledged sending a text nearly a month later hoping to talk to her. 

Busch, 36, said that while the two were in his bedroom, he again asked her to leave, for what he said was the fifth time.

'I took my hands and cupped her cheeks and I looked at her eye to eye and I said 'you need to leave.' I was defusing the situation,' he said.

Busch was called to the stand by Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice. She did not ask him whether he smashed Driscoll's head against the wall.

'She just did not want to hear that denial,' Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said after the hearing. Hardin will cross-examine Busch when the hearing resumes January 12.

'He will explain in detail his side of it,' Hardin said. 

Mr Doncheff, whom Busch hired to drive his motorhome and be his personal assistant, said Busch treated him well but had a temper at times. Busch often deferred decisions to Driscoll, who Mr Doncheff said could be 'high maintenance.'

Mr Doncheff said on the night of the motorhome encounter, Driscoll sent him a screenshot from her earlier text conversation with Busch. He said he thought it might be a good idea for Driscoll to drive to Dover.

Doncheff also said he believed Driscoll when she later told him Busch had assaulted her, even though she previously had made what he considered unbelievable statements.
