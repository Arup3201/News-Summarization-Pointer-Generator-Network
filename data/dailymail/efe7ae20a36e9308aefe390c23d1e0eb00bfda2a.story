Picking up the dry cleaning can be such a tedious chore.

But one enterprising businessman believes he has solved the problem, by delivering people's freshly-cleaned clothes using a military-style aerial drone.

Manayunk Cleaners in Philadelphia have started using a four-bladed DJI Phantom quadracopter to whisk orders over the city's crowded streets direct to their customers' front doors.

The remote-controlled device may only be powerful enough to carry just a few light items, but could be the perfect solution in an emergency.

It's the middle of rush hour, the roads are jammed, a customer needs their favourite dress or suit for an evening engagement, and they need it fast. Could a drone be the perfect answer?

Manayunk Cleaners owner Harry Vartanian admits that the service is only in its infancy and there is still a long way to go before it replaces the traditional methods of popping along in person to pick up your clothes.

While the current drone is only able to carry a couple of pounds over a short distance, Mr Vartanian is already planning an advanced model that can carry up to 10 pounds over a greater distance, according to NBC.

In the meantime he said he will hold a lottery at the end of each month with the winner getting their order flown to the door.

Mr
 Vartanian told the Huffington Post: 'It’s not just like all of a sudden
 we are going to change the whole dry cleaning service. It is more of a 
stepping stone.'

Aerial drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, are normally used by the military or the police for spying or launching missile attacks on enemies.

Their use in war has become extremely controversial with drone strikes blamed for hundreds of civilian casualties.

Last month we reported how Domino's have developed a drone capable of delivering pizzas.

The popular chain teamed up with an advertising agency to test the system delivering pizzas to its customers by flying them through the air and still keeps its cargo piping hot on arrival.
