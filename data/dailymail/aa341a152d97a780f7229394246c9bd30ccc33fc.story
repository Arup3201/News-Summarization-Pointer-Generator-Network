Spanish newspapers Mundo Deportivo and Sport reflect on Barcelona's 2-1 Champions League win against Manchester City with much of the focus being on two-goal hero Luis Suarez. 

Suarez stole the show with a first-half brace during the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie, however the Spanish publications believe the Catalan giants still have a lot to do. 

Sport believe Barcelona 'showed their quality in a big occasion' as they scored two crucial away goals to secure a narrow win.

The Spanish champions  will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of Real Madrid and Barcelona by winning the first leg of their last-16 encounter.

AS carry an interesting line regarding the future of Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea as they say Real Madrid still want the keeper and believe a deal is possible.

They would face a battle though as United are close to a new deal for the stopper.
