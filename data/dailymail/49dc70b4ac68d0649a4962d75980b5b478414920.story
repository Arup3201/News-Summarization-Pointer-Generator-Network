This is the moment a drinker got himself impaled on a metal spike after he tried to climb over a beer garden gate - even though the gate was open.Â 

The inebriated punter had been turned away by bouncers for being too drunk when he turned up at The Fiddlers pub in Northampton on Saturday night.

But the man was so determined to get into the Christmas party he decided it would be a good idea to try and sneak in via the beer garden instead.

Foolish: This is the moment a man impaled his leg on the gate of The Fiddlers pub in Wellingborough Road, Northampton after being refused entry. He tried to climb over the metal gate - even though it was open

Despite the back gate being wide open he still attempted to clamber over a pointed metal fence - but slipped and impaled his leg on a metal spike.

Emergency services were called to the pub in Wellingborough Road at around 1.40am and found the man dangling upside down from the fence.

Despite having pierced the lower part of his left leg the 30-year-old appeared to be in 'good spirits' and was so drunk he could not feel any pain.

Fire crews worked for half an hour to cut the fence in seven places to release the reveller who was then taken to hospital.

A spokesman for the Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Somebody had their leg impaled on a metal fence in Wellingborough Road.

'They were released safely by us and then taken to Northampton General Hospital by the ambulance service.'

Rob Eastham, manager of The Fiddlers, said the man has been refused entry by the bouncers because of his 'inebriated condition'.

He said: 'The bouncers came to his aid after he was calling out for some attention. He had been refused entry because he was so drunk.

'He tried to climb over the fence. Although the back gate was open and he could have just walked through it.

'They could not give him any pain relief as he had been upside down so long they could not find a vein.

'But he seemed fine and, maybe because of the drink, he did not seem to be feeling the pain.'

One punter, who had been enjoying the night out on Saturday, said: 'Everybody found it hilarious the gate was open and had no need to climb over anyway.

'He seemed OK but it must have hurt a lot in the morning.'
