The mother and stepfather of a seven-year-old boy who died three years ago have been arrested in connection with his suspected murder after police re-opened the case.

Schoolboy Blake Fowler died from a brain haemorrhage after sustaining head injuries at a property in Southampton, Hampshire, in 2011.

Police have now arrested Blake's mother Sarah Spacagna, her partner Peter Meek, and his brother Philip Meek, after re-opening the investigation into how the schoolboy died.

And in an unprecedented move, Hampshire Constabulary today apologised for the initial investigation, which they described as 'unsatisfactory'.

Tragedy: Blake Fowler was just seven-years-old when he died from a brain haemorrhage after sustaining severe head injuries in 2011

The trio were questioned by detectives from Hampshire’s Major Investigation Team after officers swooped on addresses in Southampton on Tuesday morning.

Ms Spacagna, 28, was arrested on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child.

Both men were arrested on suspicion of murder and on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child.

Hampshire police revealed the development is part of a fresh inquiry, named Operation Katla, after the case was reviewed by specialist officers.

Scene: Blake was at a property in Cromarty Road, pictured, in Shirley, Southampton, when he sustained the injuries on December 3, 2011

A spokesman said: 'Two men, aged 24 
and 25, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, and causing or 
allowing the death of a child.

'A 28-year-old woman was arrested for causing or allowing the death of a child.

'They were arrested at addresses in Southampton, and have been taken into custody where they will be interviewed.'

Blake was rushed to hospital after suffering head injuries at a house in Cromarty Road in Lordshill, Southampton, on December 3, 2011.

He died from a brain haemorrhage at Southampton General Hospital the following day.

Fatal injuries: Blake was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he died from a brain haemorrhage on December 4, 2011

At the time he suffered his injuries, Blake was in the care of Peter and Philip Meek while his mother Sarah was out shopping.

Both men were initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

A subsequent police investigation resulted in both of them being released with no further action being taken against them.

December 3, 2011: Blake was rushed to hospital after suffering head injuries at a house in Cromarty Road in Lordshill, Southampton. At the time he sustained the injuries, he was said to have been in the care of Peter Meek and his brother Philip Meek while his mother Sarah Spacagna was out shopping.

December 4, 2011: Blake dies from a brain haemorrhage at Southampton General Hospital.

December 6, 2011: Police arrest Peter Meek and his brother Philip Meek on suspicion of causing grevious bodily harm but decide to release them without charge. The case file is never passed on to the Crown Prosecution service.

November 2013: An inquest is held into Blake’s death. Coroner Keith Wiseman returns an open verdict and says there are still many unanswered questions over how he died.

April 2, 2014: Hampshire police arrest Sarah Spacagna on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child. Peter Meek and his brother Philip Meek are also arrested on suspicion of murder and on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child. Police apologise for the original ‘unsatisfactory investigation’.

However,
 the decision not to proceed with any charges was taken by Hampshire 
police officers, not the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

This
 was because the file was never passed to the Crown Prosecution Service -
 the body that decides whether there is enough evidence to pursue a 
prosecution.

Hampshire Constabulary today apologised after re-examining all lines of enquiry conducted during the initial probe.

Assistant
 Chief Constable Laura Nicholson said: 'I accept the initial 
investigation by the constabulary was unsatisfactory and for that I 
apologise.

'It was found that whilst there were performance issues relating to a number of officers there was no misconduct.

'I accept that the standard of performance was not what we would have wanted.'

Coroner Keith Wiseman held an inquest in November last year to examine the circumstances of Blake’s death.

But he returned an open verdict, after ruling there was no way of knowing for certain how Blake came to suffer the head injury that killed him.

He did not hear any evidence from witnesses to the incident and said there were inconsistencies in the accounts given to police about what happened.

It is believed the LSCB has been notified of the arrests and the publication of their findings will now be delayed until after the conclusion of any criminal proceedings.
