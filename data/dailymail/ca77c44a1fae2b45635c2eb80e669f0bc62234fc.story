A former altar boy has been convicted of bludgeoning to death his gay lover who he suspected to be a paedophile as part of a campaign to rid the world of sex offenders.

Christopher Hunnisett, 28, beat Peter Bick, 57, over the head with a hammer then walked into a nearby police station to confess to the killing.

The cold blooded killer - who claimed to have been the victim of sexual abuse in the past - had added Mr Bick to a hit-list after meeting him on the internet – despite there ‘not being a shred of evidence’ that he was a paedophile.

Brutal: This was the contents of a green rucksack - including a knife, passport and road atlas - that killer Christopher Hunnisett had with him while travelling in Peter Bick's Fiesta car

After being found guilty of murder, Hunnisett leapt over the dock in an attempt to escape before being restrained by eight security guards.

He subsequently wept as the verdict was handed down to him.

Hunnisett, from Hastings, Sussex, had previously denied one count of murder at Lewes Crown Court, saying in April, last year, ‘It is not wrong to try and stand up to evil in this world’.

Police found the supermarket worker dead in his flat, in Bexhill, where he lived alone on January 11, 2011.

The court heard that Hunnisett 
hatched his 'brutal plan' after meeting Mr Bick on the internet and 
embarking on a sexual relationship with him.

After the horrific murder, Hunnisett stole his victim's car and was captured on camera driving around the neighbourhood.

When he was arrested, police found a in his green backpack the provisions he needed for a killing spree - including a knife, road atlas and passport.

Prosecutor
Philip Katz QC said: ‘Peter Bick was living on his own in a studio 
flat, there is not a shred of evidence that he was a paedophile.

‘There is an abundance of evidence that he enjoyed consensual sex with adult men, including this defendant.

‘Hunnisett has strived in every devious way he could to make it look like the man he killed was a paedophile.

Caught: Hunnisett was pictured driving murder victim Peter Bick's Fiesta car immediately after the killing

The court was also told this was the third time the defendant had been tried for murder.

In 2002, Hunnisett was convicted and jailed but later acquitted of killing alleged paedophile Rev Ronald Glazebrook at his home in St Leonards on Sea.

Mr Katz QC added: ‘We will hear from a young woman who had a relationship with him after he got out of prison. She will tell you about his various and coloured sexual preferences. He talked to her about his plan to kill paedophiles.

‘He is confused about his own sexuality but that does not make it right to kill people then make himself look like a hero. He had planned to kill more men who he had been in contact with on the internet, he compiled a hit list and Peter Bick was at the top of that list.

‘On some of these internet chat rooms Hunnisett was pretending to be a woman. None of the men he arranged to meet was a paedophile. This is a cold blooded and dangerous killer.’

Claims: Hunnisett, left, alleged that he was abused by Rev Ronald Glazebrook, right. Hunnisett served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman's killing, but was later acquitted of his murder

The court heard that Hunnisett had previously served eight years of a life sentence for the murder of an 81-year-old retired priest called Reverend Ronald Glazebrook.

Following his conviction, material came to light which discredited Mr Glazebrook’s character and showed he had sexually assaulted a young boy, the court was told.

His body had been dismembered and was found in two different locations in Sussex.

The jury was told that Hunnisett had met Glazebrook through the church when he was young boy and later became his lodger before being convicted of his murder in 2002.

Throughout the trial Hunnisett denied 
knowing how Reverend Glazebrook died, claiming he found the dead body in
the bath ‘panicked’ and recruited a friend to help him dispose of it.

The jury convicted him of murder and he was sentenced to life.

However,
in September 2010 he was acquitted of the murder at a retrial by the 
Appeal Court - where Hunnisett alleged that the clergyman sexually 
abused him throughout his teens.

Hunnisett
then admitted punching the vicar for trying to grope him in the 
bathroom - and claimed he then fell in the bath and died.

It
was just four months after this conviction was quashed that he walked 
into a police station confessing to the killing of Mr Bick.

Mr Katz said: ‘That history is of central importance.

‘I
also want to mention that before and after both his trial and retrial 
and before the trial today Hunnisett has been seen by different 
psychiatrists and not one of them think that he is mentally ill and not 
one thinks he has a personality disorder.’

Mr Katz added Hunnisett had already admitted killing Mr Bick but the jury must decide whether he can mount a partial defence of diminished responsibility.

He said: ‘This was a brutal and carefully planned murder, responsibility for which he is trying to escape in any way he can.’

Mr Justice Saunders adjourned the case for sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court, London, on May 22.
