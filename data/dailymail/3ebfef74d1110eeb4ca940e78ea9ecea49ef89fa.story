Shelly Reilly stole nearly £250,000 she stole from her employer Scorpio UK

An oil executive hooked on gambling websites lost nearly £250,000 she had stolen from her employer as she tried to fund fertility treatment.

Shelly Reilly, 41, used company credit cards to indulge in late night betting sprees on websites 888 and Jackpot Joy.

The director at Monaco-based oil brokers Scorpio UK was addicted to the sites and desperately wanted to have a baby.

She stole £231,000 during a ten-month scam that began after her gambling spiralled out of control and left her swimming in debt.

Wearing glasses and a stylish black shift dress, Reilly blew a kiss to family in the public gallery as she was jailed yesterday.

Sentencing her to 18 months, Judge David Higgins said her behaviour was ‘deplorable and deeply anti-social’ but her case was ultimately ‘tragic’.

‘You did this to feed your gambling habit which was to improve your financial standing so you could have fertility treatment,’ he said.

‘The criminal conduct was premeditated, professionally planned, sustained, sophisticated and very serious.

‘Above all, of course, it was a gross breach of the trust placed in you on repeated occasions.

‘You were in a position to exploit the company resources and you took that opportunity. Your behaviour was deplorable and deeply anti-social.

‘You were feeding a private habit which itself originated from a desire to fulfil your own wishes.

‘I fear if you choose to stoop to such sustained and serious criminal wrongdoing you must accept the consequences.’

Reilly was tempted into losing huge sums during late night sessions on gambling websites by the offer of free bets, Southwark Crown Court was told.

She was soon deeply in debt and resorted to using company credit cards, including two belonging to co-workers to fuel her addiction.

The fraud came to light after she was sacked for poor performance due to her ‘late night activities’ in May 2012 and the company conducted an audit.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner said Reilly was initially employed in March 2010 as an office manager and was later made a director so she could deal with administrative matters.

He said: ‘An investigation showed that there had been regular late night online gambling between about 2011 and 2012 it seems that Ms Reilly having been tempting into online gambling by free bets.

‘Instead of the jackpot joy, it appears she ran up enormous and unsustainable losses which became completely out of control and she continued to gamble with a view to recover the losses and the losses mushroomed to that very high level.’

Her barrister Paul Spreadborough said she was ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ and has since repaid £63,000, including £7,000 in winnings.

‘The defendant saw this as effectively borrowing the money with a view to putting it back,’ he added.

‘She used the cards to bail her out from an addiction that had taken hold of her.

‘She was unable to seek help because she had already borrowed from her family and used money from her husband’s business.

‘She wanted to have children, she was unable and both her and her partner were engaged in trying to fund fertility treatment.

‘But it is something that she knew she had to pay for because of her age. That was the initial lure into gambling.

‘The company accounts was something she took to in desperation, already caught in this downhill gambling spiral.’

Reilly, of Southgate, North London, admitted six counts of fraud by abuse of position.
