'@freyanewman' trended in Sydney on Thursday, with hundreds of Australians voicing their opinions on Twitter as Australian university student Freya Newman fronted court.

The 21-year-old pleaded guilty to accessing files with restricted details regarding Tony Abbott's daughter Frances' $60,000 university scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design.

However - those hundreds of people were sending their tweets to the wrong Freya Newman.

On Thursday @freyanewman 'trended' on Twitter, meaning a high volume of tweets were using the term

Hundreds of Twitter users used the handle @freyanewman to tweet about the court case in which Australian Freya Newman pleaded guilty to accessing files with restricted details regarding Tony Abbott's daughter Frances' $60,000 university scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design

A completely unrelated 'Freya Newman' from Bath in England was inundated with tweets and begged for a reprieve, explaining the mix up was causing her phone to crash

A young woman of the same name on the other side of the world was bewildered when tweets starting flooding in, using her Twitter handle to discuss Thursday's court case.

Soon, the volume of tweets was so high that the notifications started to 'crash' Ms Newman's phone.

'hi im sorry but you've got the wrong freya newman, would love if u could (retweet) this cus the notifications are crashing my phone', Ms Newman tweeted from Somerest in England.

The real Freya Newman, 21, appeared at Sydney's Downing Centre Court on Thursday  for hacking a computer to leak details about Frances Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at the Whitehouse Institute of Design

The English Freya Newman was also inundated with messages on Facebook, but was quick to see the funny side of the situation.

'such nice supportive messages from strangers on facebook x' she tweeted.

Freya Newman was also sent good-intentioned but misdirected support messages on Facebook

Her tweet was accompanied by screenshots of Facebook messages from well-intentioned but slightly off-the-mark people, wishing her the best for the trial.

'I think a poor woman in Bath's phone is melting down!' tweeted a cluey Aussie.

Some Twitter users realised the wrong Freya Newman was on the receiving end of the tweets

Twitter users joke about the Bath resident being flooded with what must have seemed like tweets

One Twitter user was quick to make sure @freyanewman didn't feel left out, bidding her a good day

However, many are still continuing to direct their messages to the baffled Brit.

One kind Twitter user decided to send a message to the English Freya Newman, just so she didn't feel left out.

'@freyanewman hey I know you aren't the whistleblower we're all supporting but I hope you have a nice day anyway' Mason McCann tweeted.

The Aussie Freya Newman is believed to not be on Social Media. 

An selection of the many tweets that @freyanewman was notified of - much to her confusement

The university student will have to wait another month to find out her fate. 

She was due to be sentenced on Thursday, but Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan adjourned her sentencing until November 25 after submissions from the defence and prosecution.

Newman, who studies communications at the University of Technology Sydney, pleaded guilty in September to accessing restricted data. She then handed the information to journalists

Ms Newman's lawyer Tony Payne SC, who was representing her for free, asked the Magistrate not to record a conviction.

'Freya suffered and continues to suffer the consequences for the rest of her (life),' he told the Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday.

He said the 21-year-old suffered anxiety due to the media attention the case had attracted and added that future jobs and travel would potentially be affected if a conviction was recorded.

'A sense of injustice motivated Ms Newman, not greed or a desire for notoriety or to embarrass Ms Abbott,' Mr Payne said. 

'She was not aware that her actions were against the law or that her identity would become known.' 

The prosecution agreed the offence wasn't done for personal gain or notoriety but out of a sense of social justice and public interest.  

Newman accessed the files about a $60,000 Whitehouse Design Institute scholarship given to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughter Frances in 2011

The Hunters Hill woman was a casual library assistant at the fashion and design college where Ms Abbott studied and used her position to access information about her enrolment.

Ms Newman used the log-in and password of another staff member on May 20 to access Ms Abbott's details through the student record system, according to court documents.

The documents allege she then emailed two other employees at the private design school saying '... there's a bit about Frances meeting with Leanne J, the CEO of Whitehouse Institute on February 21, 2011 and then receiving a Managing Director's Scholarship three days later'.

'Got em. Might go meet Chris now to talk tactics.'

The following day, a story headlined Leaked Documents Cast Doubt on Abbott's $60,000 Scholarship Claims was published on news website New Matilda, written by Chris Graham.

A handful of supporters were outside the court holding signs reading #FreeFreya ahead of her sentencing

No sensitive data was accessed and no information about any other student was viewed during the 103 minutes Ms Newman was in the database, Mr Payne told the court. 

She also committed the offence in the full knowledge she was under CCTV surveillance, admitted what she had done to her employer and resigned the following day, he said.

But the prosecution argued a conviction should be recorded to deter anyone else from committing the offence.

Ms Newman's family and supporters were packed into the court room and rallied around the student as she left.

She faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison.

Groups voicing solidarity for Newman have sprung up on Facebook and a handful of supporters were outside the court holding signs reading #FreeFreya ahead of her sentencing. 

Outside, neither Ms Newman, her parents nor Mr Payne commented.

Ms Newman's will return to the same court on November 25. 

Newman later emailed two other employees at the college saying she had to meet Chris to talk tactics. The next day, a story was published on news website New Matilda written by Chris Graham
