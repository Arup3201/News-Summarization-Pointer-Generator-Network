Michael Gove has written a belated apology to one of his former teachers for indulging in ‘pathetic showing-off’ and coming up with ‘clever-dick’ questions in class.

The Education Secretary wrote the extraordinary open letter to Danny Montgomery, who taught him French 30 years ago, to publicise this year’s Teaching Awards.

Mr Gove, who wants teachers to clamp down on badly behaved pupils, confesses that he and his classmates at Robert Gordon’s College, a private school in Aberdeen, had viewed the ‘rookie’ teacher as ‘ripe for ragging’, or teasing.

Sorry, sir: Michael Gove (pictured this week, left) has apologised to a former teacher for 'showing-off' when he was a 15-year-old schoolboy in Aberdeen (right)

In his letter in the Radio Times to publicise the awards, which will be on BBC2 on Sunday, Mr Gove wrote: ‘You were, without any pretension or pomposity, attempting to coax a group of hormonal lads to look beyond familiar horizons and venture further.

'And all we could do was compete to think of clever-dick questions to embarrass you and indulge in pathetic showing-off at your expense.’

He added: ‘You wanted us to enjoy 
some of the pleasure you had found in the very best that had been 
thought and written. But we were a cocksure crew of precociously 
assertive boys who recognised you were only a few years older – a rookie
in the classroom – and therefore ripe for ragging. And because we 
misbehaved, we missed out.

‘But because you cared, you persevered. And for that you deserve my apology. And my thanks.’ 

Mr
Gove, 45, added: ‘So Danny, it may be too late to say I’m sorry. But, 
as my mum told me, it’s never too late to set the record straight.’

Mr Montgomery, 55, who still teaches 
at Robert Gordon’s College, said yesterday: ‘Even in those days, Michael
stood out. I remember the words of one of my colleagues at the time: 
“That boy is a future leader of the Conservative Party”. 

'He was already 
known for his sharp wit, strongly held beliefs backed by apparently 
limitless general knowledge and keen debating skills, which resulted in 
the downfall of many opponents.’

He
added: ‘It’s often hard to know how much is genuinely being 
communicated in a classroom, so it was highly gratifying to learn that 
Michael not only remembers the content of my lessons but also 
appreciates the wider learning that I was aiming to encourage.’
