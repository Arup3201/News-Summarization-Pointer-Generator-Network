Britain's smartest footballer Clarke Carlisle has been slapped with a driving ban after being found drunk behind the wheel of his Audi Q7.

The 31-year-old, who was the first Premier League player to win Countdown, was hit with 20-month ban at Bury Magistrates' Court.

The court heard the Preston North End defender, who is on loan from Burnley FC, was so drunk in the hours before he was pulled over, he reported his car stolen as he had forgotten where he was parked.

No brainer: Clarke Carlisle pleaded guilty to drink driving, the 31-year-old is regarded as one the brighter footballers after his Countdown win last year

Magistrates heard the officer who he reported the theft to was the same PC who pulled him over.

Carlisle, a self-confessed alcoholic, had been out drinking the night before in Bury when he was pulled over by police in his £40,000 car.

He was later found to be twice the legal drink drive limit, The Mirror reported.

The married 
dad-of-three told magistrates: 'It was a gross error of judgement. Just 
because you feel fine the next morning, it doesn't mean you are safe to 
drive.'

On the pitch: Carlisle is now on loan from Burnley FC, but won't be able to drive to Preston for practice

Carlisle, of Ripponden, West Yorkshire, was fined £2,365 after pleading guilty to drink driving.

Carlisle was the first Premier League player to win Countdown in February last year.

But he wasn't the first professional footballer on the Channel 4 show. Notts County midfielder Neil Mackenzie won eight contests in 2008.
