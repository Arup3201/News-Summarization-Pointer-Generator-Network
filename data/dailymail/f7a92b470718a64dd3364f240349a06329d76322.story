The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are searching for a  new nanny to take on their tour of New Zealand and Australia.

Their current nanny, Jessie Webb – who looked after Prince William when he was a child – has reached the end of her contract.

According to sources close to the couple, Mrs Webb, 71, came out of retirement to look after Prince George on the condition that she would work only for three months.

In fact, Mrs Webb is still at Kensington Palace and William and Kate are keen to retain her services, but they are discreetly looking for extra help for the month-long trip this spring.

It took a lot of persuading to get Jessie to take the job in the first place, but she loves William and wanted to help out,’ said a source.

‘I can’t imagine that she will want to be travelling around the world at  her age. If she does, she will need an assistant.’

The Duke and Duchess did not hire a maternity nurse after George’s birth last July. Instead  the couple moved into the Middleton family home in Berkshire so that Kate’s mother, Carole, could help out.

When they moved to Kensington Palace last September, they persuaded Mrs Webb to join their household.

It had been rumoured that Carole Middleton could join the tour Down Under to help look after George. However, aides insist that will not be the case.

The Duke and Duchess will have a punishing schedule, criss-crossing the two countries in less than a month. ‘They need round-the-clock help for George if he joins them,’ said a source.

‘Kate might also want to think about taking a dresser or a lady’s maid. It sounds grand, but it’s actually very practical.

The Queen wouldn’t dream of travelling overseas without a lady-in-waiting.’ In addition to Mrs Webb, William and Kate also have a housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone. Kate’s only luxury is her personal hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, who visits the Palace. She is also expected to join the Royal tour.

Carole Middleton has taken a hands-on role in caring for her grandson. According to one family friend, she visits Kensington Palace several times a week.

The friend said:  ‘Carole is very involved. She often arrives without warning.’

A spokesman for the Royal couple last night declined to comment.
