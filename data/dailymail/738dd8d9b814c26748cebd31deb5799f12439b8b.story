The scene in the Gibraltar apartment where a British father was stabbed to death alongside his partner and two young daughters in a suspected murder-suicide was so horrific that the police officers who found their bodies have been offered counselling.

A 31-year-old man, who is reportedly from Liverpool, and his 37-year-old Spanish girlfriend were found dead yesterday morning, alongside a four-year-old Spanish girl and a six-week-old baby.

It is understood that all four were found with stab wounds, while the woman and the girls reportedly had their necks slashed.

Now a police officer working on the investigation has revealed he expects the majority of the team who found their bodies to accept the offer of counselling because the seen 'was that disturbing'.

Acting superintendent Wayne Tunbridge, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are not looking for anyone outside of the family at this stage  but we have numerous lines of enquiry.

'We are in communication with the family members of the four deceased who now must come to Gibraltar before we release any details about the individuals.

'We have welfare officers helping the officers who have been to the scene. We are offering every officer counselling and any support they require.

'We have had many take up this offer including myself.'

Speaking about the progress of the case, he added: 'The four deceased are a family unit and they are connected, but I can't tell you anymore than that.

'We had to move the children because of the warm conditions, I took that decision, they are now at St Bernard's hospital.

'In a case of this magnitude we have to assume the worst. We are working with the UK and Spain on this and they have both been extremely helpful.' 

Police on the British enclave say they are not currently looking for any suspects in connection with the deaths.

The family, who have been identified by police but will not be named until next of kin have been informed, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am yesterday.

Spanish media reported that they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar a few days earlier. Police confirmed the man was of British nationality while the women had Spanish nationality but was originally from Cuba.

No entry: A Gibraltar police officer stands guard outside the murder scene earlier this morning

Police officers begin investigations in Gibraltar after a British man, his Spanish partner and two young girls, including a six-week-old baby, were found stabbed to death inside a flat in an apparent murder-suicide

Local newspapers reported that the man was from Liverpool and that the four-year-old girl was the woman's daughter from a previous relationship, while the baby girl had been born in Spain. 

Police were called to the scene at 11am after a member of the company which owns the property went to the flat. The person did not get any response from knocking on the door but noticed that the property was locked from the inside, police said.   

Spanish newspaper El Mundo quoted police sources saying the door to the flat had not been forced and the three females all had cuts to their necks. 

A major police investigation has now been launched and detectives and forensic officers are working in the flat while the area remains cordoned off. 

A nearby restaurant owner said: 'We have all been told not to say anything. There was a real panic around the streets when the news broke with lots of policemen.'

'This is Gibraltar, where nothing like this normally happens so we are all looking out for each other at this horrible time,' he added.

A policeman told The Olive Press that when they went in there and found the bodies, the kitchen light was still on.

A male neighbour added: 'They moved in three or four days ago. I was out this morning but when I got back there were police officers everywhere with plain-clothed officers going in and out of the house all day and some officers came and spoke to me but I had nothing to say.'

'It´s such a shock, it´s almost unthinkable.'

A high level Gibraltar government source insisted the family found dead in Gibraltar  had only been there for five or six days and confirmed that he believed that the man murdered his family before taking his own life.

'Put it this way, we don't believe children of four and six weeks could slash their own throats,' he said.

Two Home Office pathologists - one of them specialising in child cases - are flying out from the UK today to conduct the post-mortems. The bodies have not yet been moved from the dwelling so as to preserve the evidence of the murder scene. 

Spanish media reported they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar to stay in the rented flat (pictured) a few days ago. Police said it was not clear if they were there in transit or had moved to the area

The family, who have been identified by police but have not yet been named, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am yesterday

Chief Minister Fabian Picardo last night led a minute's silence at the Parliament of Gibraltar following the horrific news.

He said until the police have completed their investigation, the Government can't comment any further.

But he added: 'As a husband and father, I'm shocked by this terrible crime, as, I am sure, are all residents of Gibraltar. Gibraltarians aren't used to these types of events in our peaceful community, respectful of the law.

'Words are not enough in moments such as this and all we can do is keep the victims and their families in our thoughts and trust that justice will prevail.'  

Police spokesman Superintendent Richard Ullger said tonight: 'We are trying to contact close relatives and for that reason we cannot give out any names. 

'But I can tell you that the man came from the United Kingdom and the woman had Spanish nationality and was of Cuban extraction. The four year old also had Spanish nationality.' 

He added: 'The deaths are not natural deaths and we are carrying out a major investigation lead by Acting Superintendent Wayne Tunbridge from the Serious Crime Unit. 

The family had reportedly been living in Spain and had only recently arrived in Gibraltar to visit a family friend

'Police found the bodies after responding to a call from a member of the public. At the moment we are still investigating the relationship between the four people and the circumstances of their deaths.

'We are still trying to reach some family members and won't be revealing the identities until the next of kin have been informed. We are not speculating on the cause of deaths.'   

A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police also described how the force had been alerted to the incident.

They said: 'A member of staff of the company that was letting out the flat, which is a rental property, attended the residence.

'They got no answer from within but noticed that the house was locked from inside and that sent a few alarm bells ringing and they decided to call the police.

'At the moment what we are doing is trying to get as much background information from both the Spanish and the UK sides of the family.'

None of the deceased are thought to have been known to police or social services in Gibraltar.

The spokesman added: 'These people had only been in Gibraltar for a few days, I think it was either last Thursday or Friday that they arrived.

'We are trying to discover if they were here in transit to the UK or whether they were planning on staying for any length of time in Gibraltar.'

A Home Office forensic pathologist is expected to travel to Gibraltar in the next couple of days to perform post-mortem examinations on the bodies. 

The Commissioner of Police Eddie Yome also described today's tragedy as a 'unique event for Gibraltar'.
