Migrants from the European Union could be charged for seeing a GP. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has questioned if it is appropriate to give free health care to short-term visitors

Migrants from the European Union could be charged for seeing a GP, put to the bottom of the council house queue and denied access to benefits among emergency measures being drawn up by ministers.

A squeeze on access to the Health Service, taxpayer-subsidised housing and welfare is being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are lifted at the end of this year.

However, Number 10 confirmed that to comply with EU law, restrictions would have to apply at least in principle to UK citizens too – raising the prospect of people having to prove their eligibility to access services.

Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘What a pity that having failed to adequately control our own borders, we are now having to put up frontiers to our public services.

‘Had we managed to control who was coming in to our country, we would not need to be rationing access to our benefits. This will mean British people will have to effectively carry the equivalent of an identity card to access public services.’ 

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘The Government must spell out its plans in full detail and come clean on which people living in the UK will lose out.’

The most drastic step being considered is to make key benefits dependent on how long applicants have lived and worked here. Some payments, such as jobseeker’s allowance and the state pension, are already linked to National Insurance contributions.

A Government source said that could be extended across other payments – such as income support or tax credits – to ensure that those who have ‘worked and paid in here for years’ benefit most.

Ministers on a committee chaired by immigration minister Mark Harper have also proposed telling councils to give greater priority to local people in the allocation of housing. Factors such as whether people have gone to school in an area, or have family locally, could be given greater weight.

Earlier this year it emerged that the Department of Health is drawing up proposals so that certain categories of migrant workers are told that they must have private medical insurance to prevent the NHS becoming an ‘international health service’.

Foreign students and temporary visitors are expected to be prevented from getting free care on the NHS.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently
told MPs: ‘We have to ask whether it is appropriate for us to be giving
free health care to short-term visitors. We will be saying more about 
that issue shortly.’

Former Labour welfare minister Frank Field (left), and Tory
MP Nicholas Soames (right) oint chairmen of a cross-party group on migration, said they welcomed a review on access by 
new arrivals to NHS and housing

Under 
EU law, the UK is entitled to reclaim the cost of healthcare from the 
patient’s country of origin, but the NHS has written off at least 
£35million because it is often complex and costly to reclaim the cash.

Government
sources played down the possibility of an ‘entitlement card’ that would
be required to access NHS care. One said: ‘We don’t want to do anything
that would look like ID cards by the back door.’

However,
it is likely to be a requirement that students and migrants who claim 
they are ‘self-sufficient’, meaning they are not coming looking 
immediately for work, have to have private medical insurance. 

Those who wanted to see a GP or have non-emergency treatment on the NHS would be charged. 

Tory
MP Nicholas Soames and former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, 
joint chairmen of a cross-party group on migration, said: ‘We warmly 
welcome the news that the Government are looking closely at access by 
new arrivals both to the NHS and to social housing.

The
cross-party group has vigorously been pressing the Health Secretary to 
introduce checks on access to GPs and wider NHS services. We have also 
urged the housing minister to make the recording of nationality 
compulsory for new lets.’ 

Transitional
arrangements in place since 2005, which restrict the rights of 
29million Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to live and work in other EU 
states, will expire in December.

Campaign group MigrationWatch has claimed that as many as 250,000 could arrive over the next five years.

A
Downing Street spokesman said a Cabinet sub-committee had met ‘several’
times to discuss the issue of migrants’ access to benefits and that an 
announcement was expected before the Queen’s Speech in May.

Minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke warned his colleagues not to play up ‘fanciful fears’ being stoked by UKIP.

He
added: ‘Some of the things that have been canvassed around I don’t 
recognise as Government policy or anything likely to be adopted by a 
Conservative Party that I recognise.’ 

Some EU nations find it easier to restrict access to benefits than the UK.

Many use ID cards, which make it easy to check whether a migrant is resident without discriminating, because all citizens have to carry cards.

Some also tend to have more contributory benefits, accessible only to those who have paid into an insurance system.

FRANCE Out of work benefits: Usually not payable until someone has lived in France for at least six months.

Healthcare: People expected to have signed up for health insurance, and apply for a ‘Carte Vitale’ eligibility card after passing residence test. Most patients will have to pay up front before claiming the costs back.

Housing: Access defined on basis of need. No separate requirements for a link with the area.

GERMANY Out of work benefits: Can be claimed only if the applicant has worked in Germany – however briefly. Must usually be resident, and prove this by signing in at the ‘residents’ registration office’ of the local council. No minimum period of residence.

Healthcare: Individuals must join statutory health insurance.  Only once they start paying in, can they receive general healthcare.

Housing: Access defined on basis of need. No separate requirements for a link with the area so migrants can get housing.

ITALY Out of work benefits: Claimants entitled only if they live in Italy, and local councils carry out checks. Certificate of residence, granted by local authority, must be provided before benefits can be accessed.

Healthcare: Eligibility based on residence, and patient must have started to pay into the state insurance system. The patient may have to contribute to the cost of some drugs and treatments.

Housing: One of the few countries open about giving its nationals priority in access to social housing.

SPAIN Out of work benefits: Claimants must have worked in Spain for at least 360 days in the past six years. They must have registered with social security service and joined insurance scheme.

Healthcare: Workers expected to join insurance scheme. Those who are not ordinarily resident in Spain or are not part of scheme will get only emergency care paid for.

Housing: Decided by the income of applicant and disabilities. Provinces allowed to impose their own residence requirements.
