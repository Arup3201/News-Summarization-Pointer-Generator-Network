A onetime producer of the reality show 'Survivor' was convicted in Mexico Thursday of murdering his wife during a 2010 Cancun beach vacation.

Bruce Beresford-Redman, 43, was found guilty and then sentenced to 12 years in prison by Judge Víctor Manuel Echeverria Tun, Quintana Roo state prosecutor Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres said.

Juanita Beresford-Redman, Bruce's mother, said her son was also ordered to pay a fine of 43,000 pesos, which is equivalent to $2,800. 

The former producer was on vacation in Cancun with his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman, and their two children in 2010 when her body was found dumped in a sewer cistern at the resort where they were staying.

Rocky relationship: Monica learned her husband had cheated on her, and the beach vacation was supposed to be an attempt to mend their marriage 

The vacation was supposed to be an attempt to repair their troubled marriage after she learned her husband had cheated on her.

The family of Burgos issued a statement through their lawyer, Alison Triessl, late Thursday.

'It has been nearly 5 years since they lost their beloved sister,' Triessl said. 'Not a day goes by that they don't miss her terribly and nothing will bring her back, but they can finally say that she has received the justice she deserved.'

'We are appalled and disgusted with this gross miscarriage of justice. Over an exhausting three and a half year period this trial has done nothing but prove Bruce’s innocence beyond any doubt. 

Whatever lies behind this ruling it is based on neither facts nor evidence. This is a disservice to Monica’s memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand. 

At some point, even in Mexico, Bruce’s innocence will lead to his freedom. We will immediately appeal this absurd decision and will not rest until Bruce is exonerated and returned home. 

This decision must lead to a reconsideration of the extradition treaty between the United States and Mexico as it is clear that Mexico cannot meet even minimal standards of justice. We remain ever grateful to all those who continue to support Bruce.'

Beresford-Redman's family also released a statement in response to the outcome of the trial, strongly condemning what they described as a 'gross miscarriage of justice.'

'This is a disservice to Monica’s memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand,' read the statement posted on a Facebook page dedicated to Beresford-Redman's case.

The family plan to appeal the guilty verdict as soon as possible.

Beresford-Redman maintained his innocence, but in 2011 a US court upheld his extradition. In 2012, State Department officials signed a warrant clearing his extradition to Mexico. And shortly after arriving in Mexico, a judge ordered the Emmy-nominated producer to stand trial on a murder charge.

Part of the evidence in the case included statements from guests at the high-end Moon Palace resort who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress coming from the couple's room on the night the 42-year-old victim went missing.

The producer's lawyers maintained the noises came from Beresford-Redman and his children playing loud games throughout the night and argued there was not any forensic evidence that he killed his wife.

Beresford-Redman had been ordered to stay in Mexico when his wife's body was found, but he returned to Los Angeles, where he surrendered to authorities after an arrest warrant was issued in Mexico.  

Mexican authorities said Beresford-Redman murdered his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room

Mexican authorities said Beresford-Redman kiledf his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room at the Moon Palace Resort in Cancun on April 5, 2010.

Her decomposing body was discovered in a sewer two days later. A coroner noted that she had suffered scratches on the neck and a blow to the right temple.

British tourists in the room next door to Beresford-Redman’s suite reported hearing noises that sounded like a woman in distress, which his attorneys chalked up to loud playtime with his two kids, then ages 3 and six.

Lawyers also argued that Mexican authorities found no blood evidence in the couple's room and claimed that investigators and prosecutors used the fact that the couple was experiencing marital problems due to an affair by Bruce Beresford-Redman to support the theory that he killed his wife.

In a statement to police, Bruce Beresford-Redman admitted arguing with Monica at the resort but denied he was ever violent toward her.

After police noted scratches on his neck and hands, Beresford-Redman said that he and his family had taken several outdoor excursions on their vacation and the injuries were a result of climbing over rocks and diving into the water on the trips.

Shortly after his wife's death, Mexican authorities seized Beresford-Redman's passport and ordered him to stay in the country while they investigated.

But he returned to the United States and later declared himself innocent. A Mexican judge issued a warrant for his arrest and he was extradited in early February 2012.

During a jailhouse interview with CBS's 48 Hours Mystery taped later that month, Beresford-Redman once again proclaimed his innocence.

‘I didn't kill my wife, I really didn't,’ he from behind bars. ‘I can't imagine how anyone who listened to everything said could possibly think I had anything to do with killing my wife.’

Beresford-Redman worked on 48 episodes of the competition reality show Survivor between February 2002 and May 2004, while he also helped produce hit MTV car series Pimp My Ride.

‘Am I a survivor or not?’ Mr Beresford-Redman told CBS. ‘I think very much remains to be seen.’
