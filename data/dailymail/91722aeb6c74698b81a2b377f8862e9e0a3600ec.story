Wesley Warren Jr finally sees the light at the end of the tunnel.

Formerly known as 'the man with the 132lb scrotum', Warren, from Las Vegas, made headlines around the world last year when the rare medical condition - known as scrotal lymphedema - was featured on a TV special.

Fortunately, a California doctor took pity on the 49-year-old and agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation to remove it for free. But Warren was still not happy.

He complained the surgery made his life a misery because it left him with a one-inch penis. He said he would never be able to have a relationship with a woman.

But finally, Warren is feeling optimistic about the future ahead of more surgery later this month.

After: Wesley Warren Jr, left, is shown with Dr Joel Gelman, who led a team of surgeons and nurses in correcting the abnormality that Warren endured for five years

Miserable: Warren's story will be told in Monday night's one-hour TLC special, The Man With The 132lb Scrotum which recounts his journey, from discovering his condition to where he is today

Before: Wesley Warren spent the past five years of his life with a freakishly huge scrotum - the result of a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema

Home help: His ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months

His story will be told on Monday night's TLC special, The Man With The 132lb Scrotum, which documents his journey from when he first realized he had the condition to where he is today - 200lbs lighter and no longer a 'freak'. (Warren weighed himself after the surgery and this was what he had dropped)

His ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months.

'It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life,' he told the New York Post. 'It got so bad one day that I stood in 
my living room and cried. There was a fresh breakage of skin...and it stung to no end.

Warren adapted by turning hooded sweatshirts upside down and using them as pants.

His 
penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to 
urinate on himself and said only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman.

Unhappy: Wesley Warren expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed, but the surgery has left him 'disfigured'

I was expecting to be stared at — if you look like a freak you expect people to look at you like you’re a freak,' he said. 

'I would only get upset when, every 
once-in-a-while, some person with no manners would stare at me and start
 laughing and give me that "freak passing by" look.

'That caused me
 in the past to say a "word" or two with regards to rudeness. 'Besides, I was OK with the stares. That’s what I was 
expecting.'

At
 one stage Warren was so desperate he considered selling his testicles on eBay to
 pay for an operation to remove them before Dr Joel Gelman offered his 
services.

Though he initially complained that he was 'still disfigured', he has since become more optimistic about his future.

'I can see a light at the end of the 
tunnel, but I’m still in the tunnel.'

He
 will return to Howard Stern's Sirius/XM radio show on Monday. After he 
previously called in, he received an outpouring of affection from 
listeners in the form of donations and supportive e-mails, which he says
 he’ll never forget.

'If not for the generosity of those people who have helped me, I’d be 
out on the street and disabled.

'I want to 
give the biggest thank you in the world to these people — as big as 
the Big Apple.'

Discomfort: Warren could not urinate like a normal man and wore a hoodie for pants to conceal his enormous genitals

Talking about his life before the 
operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that 
the growth ruled his life.

'I could only walk in baby steps – I had to stop every 30 seconds,' he said.

'It
 was just horrible. I couldn’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then
 I fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and 
lift me up.

On April 8, Dr Gelman and three other 
physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective 
sac of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, 
according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.

The mass caused by the condition, known as scrotal lymphedema, had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years.

The
 massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors
 had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his 
scrotum.

The
 extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast 
Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world.

Fear: Warren was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong
