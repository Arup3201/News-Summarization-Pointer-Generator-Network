Mohamed Diame's £3.5million move to Hull City from West Ham is back on with Tom Cleverley set to choose Aston Villa over the Tigers.

Diame has been pushed down the pecking order at Upton Park following the summer arrivals of fellow midfielders Cheikhou Kouyate and Alex Song.

Diame joined the Hammers in 2012 after three impressive seasons with Wigan, and in January last year Arsenal were rumoured to be interested in the Senegalese midfielder.

But his star seems to have faded, and a move to Steve Bruce's Hull now looks likely. 

Manchester United and England midfielder Cleverley is poised to join Villa in an £8m move. 

The United youth product was used consistently by both David Moyes and Alex Ferguson but his time at Old Trafford appears to be drawing to a close.
