Once dubbed the Michelin Man look, anorak coats are bringing the fashion of the ski slopes to the city.

Down jackets are being snapped up in huge numbers as winter temperatures and rain set in while the traditional winter coat is being left on the coat rack.

Now that the designs are lightweight and more streamlined with cinched waists, and at a reasonable price, anorak has become a retail sensation as even celebrities don the must-have winter item.

Retailers are recording increased sales since retailer Uniqlo produced a line of ultra-lightweight down in 2009, inspiring a surge in fashionable, more flattering designs.

People are particularly buying Uniqlo’s down jacket, from £80, designed in collaboration with designer label Theory.

Their sales are up by 30 per cent as are Topshop while Whistles has experienced an amazing 650 per cent surge in sales just on last year.

Down jackets are being worn by 
celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Rihanna, Audrey Tautou and 
Yoko Ono as styles become massive sellers.

Natalie Kingham, the international buyer at online fashion retailer Matches, was quoted by The Times saying: ‘When the weather is so unpredictable, they are effortless to wear.

She said people are also wearing the coats under more tailored coats, creating a stylish look. The website has seen a 129 per cent rise in sales.

At my-wardrobe, online fashion retailer, cropped and longer styles have been equally popular with designs by Michael Kors, Helmut Lang and Joseph Kelly becoming bestsellers.

Virginia Norris, PR manager at Whistles, said: ‘As with many trends, designers have embraced something that began life as a practical item but which has become something more aesthetically appealing.

She believes that the anorak trend has become popular because traditional woollen coats can become waterlogged when it is raining and are not always warm enough during the coldest months.
