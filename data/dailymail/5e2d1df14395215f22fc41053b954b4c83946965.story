Joe Hart is fighting to keep his place in Manchester City's starting line-up as the Premier League champions embark on a critical week in their season.

The England goalkeeper conceded a soft winner against Stoke in City's last game and manager Manuel Pellegrini is considering giving No 2 Willy Caballero a chance against Arsenal, Bayern Munich or Chelsea over the course of the next eight days.

Caballero, a £6million summer signing from Pellegrini's old club Malaga, has not played since letting in three goals against Saturday's opponents Arsenal in the Community Shield last month.

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is considering a change of goalkeeper 

Asked if he has been told that he will play at the Emirates, the Argentine keeper said: 'Maybe, but only the coach knows this.

'I'm waiting for my chance. I am training very well and maybe it could be the next game or maybe it could be another game – but I am ready.

'Competition between goalkeepers is always good. When I spoke to the coach about coming to City, he told me it would be a good opportunity for me. But he said I would have to work so hard to play because everyone knows that Joe Hart is a brilliant goalkeeper and a fantastic person too. Joe has helped me so much since I came here.'

Pellegrini axed Hart for seven Premier League games towards the end of last year and played Costel Pantilimon instead.

But the City boss kept his cards close to his chest on Friday, saying: 'We'll see game by game. One hour and 15 minutes before kick-off you will know which goalkeeper starts.

'Willy Caballero can be in any team, he's a very good goalkeeper. In this moment I'm playing Joe Hart, but he will have his opportunity soon.

'Willy has a good career behind him. If you want to be a top goalkeeper you must have all the attributes – good distribution, to know when to go for the ball, to be good one-on-one, to not concede early goals.

'It's important to have competition in every position in the team, not just with Joe Hart and Willy Caballero.'

Hart was criticised for allowing Mame Biram Diouf's low shot to go under his body when Stoke won 1-0 at the Etihad, but Pellegrini insisted that Caballero's prospects do not hinge on his rival's errors.

'I am not waiting for Joe Hart to make a first mistake to change him for Willy Caballero,' said Pellegrini. 'Maybe in the last year Joe didn't start very well but he finished very well.

'I analyse the goals and individual mistakes with the players, the whole team. I think a lot of players were involved in [conceding] that goal.'

Willy Caballero was speaking at 'City Streets', an interactive gang awareness project organised by the club's foundation to educate local schoolchildren about the negative effects of gang and crime culture.
