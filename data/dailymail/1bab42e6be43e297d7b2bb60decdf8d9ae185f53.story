Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home

A teenager charged with manslaughter over the death of a surgeon found lying injured in the road has been released on bail after appearing before magistrates today.

Anthony Owen, 68, was discovered with severe head injuries next to his Honda Civic car, its engine still running, near his home in a ‘millionaires’ row’ village on March 11 and died six days later.

Police appealed for information about three teenagers seen riding away from Mr Owen’s £750,000 thatched house on BMX bikes.

There is understood to have been a confrontation between Mr Owen and a group of youths, although detectives do not believe they were attempting to steal his car or any other property.

Today a 16-year-old teenager, also from Hale Village, appeared before Halton Youth Court, at Runcorn, charged with the manslaughter of Mr Owen. He cannot be named for legal reason.

During the hearing, wearing a white Nike t-shirt, the skinny brown-haired teenager sat for most of the hearing before standing to confirm his name, address and date of birth.

The case has been adjourned to 30th May at Runcorn Magistrates Court at 9.45am.

Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone. A witness reported seeing three youths on BMX bikes tearing away from the area minutes before his body was found

Two other teenagers, aged 14 and 17, have been released on bail pending  further inquiries.

Mr Owen’s death shocked residents in the prosperous Cheshire enclave of Hale village, between Widnes and Liverpool.

Yesterday some told how they had been worried about antisocial behaviour blamed on teenagers from nearby estates.

Mr
Owen himself had reported the theft of a trailer from another property 
in the village earlier this year, although the incident is not being 
linked with his death.

Friends and relatives described him as a man with ‘high moral values’ who was unafraid to stand up for himself.

In a statement yesterday, his relatives 
said: ‘We remember him as a man deeply committed to his family and his 
profession. He was one with high moral values and exacting standards.’

Mal Sutton, a friend of Mr Owen, said he would have stood up to wrong-doing of any kind.

Laurie Northern, who regularly attended church with devout Catholic Mr Owen, described him as ‘the type of man who would stand up for himself'.

Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours

Barbara Myers, 70, a neighbour of Mr Owen, said youths from outside Hale village had been causing disruption recently.

‘There have been some kids riding up and down the street on BMXs and riding all over the pavement,’ she said.

Last night a spokesman for Cheshire Police said: ‘A teenager has been charged with the manslaughter of Anthony Owen in Widnes. 

‘Two other teenagers − aged 14 and 17 − who were also arrested in connection with the incident have been bailed pending further inquiries.’
