They say never mix business and pleasure but one Texas police officer decided to pop the big question to his girlfriend while on the job.

Gregory Parris, 28, from Galveston, arranged for a patrol squad team to pull over the love of his life so he could propose to her in an elaborate ruse.

The bold stunt was caught on dashcam camera, with footage showing poor Sarah Wolff on the verge of tears with sirens flashing before she realizes what's going on.

Will you marry me? Parris, who was watching the whole episode from another patrol car, drove up and walked toward his girlfriend

Spouses-to-be: Wolff's tears turned to laughter as her boyfriend got down on one knee, produced a ring and asked her to marry him

At first an officer tells her she has a broken taillight and that she also faces outstanding warrants.

'Are you serious?' she exclaims as she's escorted out of her car.

The unwitting Wolff starts to cry.

Parris, who was watching the whole episode from another patrol car, then drives up and walks toward his girlfriend. 

Her tears turn to laughter as he gets down on one knee, produces a ring and asks her to marry him.

The two then lovingly embrace in the middle of the road. 

Elaborate stunt: Parris said that he was 'very nervous' that day but his hard work paid off in the end

Grand gesture: The police officer flashes the diamond engagement ring at the camera 

All smiles: The happy couple are set to tie the knot on July 6

Parris said that he was 'very nervous' that day but his hard work paid off in the end.

His wife-to-be said she had no idea about what was going to happen and the officers involved 'deserve academy awards' for their convincing act.

She concluded during an interview with KHOU-TV: 'I can't imagine being proposed to any better than that. It was perfect for us.'

The happy couple are now set to tie the knot on  July 6
