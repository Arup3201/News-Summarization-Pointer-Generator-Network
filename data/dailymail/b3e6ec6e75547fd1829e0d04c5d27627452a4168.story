Julie Bentley: 'Girls today face real and unique challenges as they grow up - I want our programme to continue responding to those challenges'

A leading abortion rights campaigner has been named as the new chief executive of the Girl Guides.

Julia Bentley – who for five years  ran the campaign group supporting  abortion rights and sex education –  said that she was delighted at her  appointment to ‘the ultimate feminist organisation’.

However, her role at Girlguiding UK has raised eyebrows among some religious  groups and those who are concerned about the premature sexualisation of girls.

Under Miss Bentley’s leadership the fpa – formerly known as the Family Planning  Association – sells condom  demonstrators for use by girls as young as 11 and opened an online sex shop sells sex toys and aids to customers of any age, subject only to some users ticking a box to confirm they are over 18.

Girlguiding UK yesterday said that girls face challenges growing up and Miss Bentley will ‘ensure guiding continues to meet those challenges head on’.

Miss Bentley also insisted that there was no contradiction between her previous  work at the fpa and her appointment to the £85,000-a-year job.

‘I have worked in a wide range of settings and I have a broad insight into what affects girls,’ she said. ‘I don’t think any of this is at odds with the Girl Guides. In fact I believe the Guides is the ultimate feminist organisation.’

The move comes at a time when the movement has been in competition with the Scouts to attract members.

Although the female-only Guides have 538,000 members from the age of 11, the Scouts, who have been recruiting girls since the 1970s, have more than 66,000 in their ranks.

Confidence: Julie Bentley hopes to encourage young girls to become confident, self-assured women

Miss Bentley’s appointment was criticised by Christian groups and family campaigners last night.

They claimed that the campaigner  was an unsuitable figure to run the movement which should provide girls with an alternative to celebrity culture and early sex.

Mike Judge, of the Christian Institute think-tank, said: ‘I do not think she is a fitting individual to run the Girl Guides.

‘The Girl Guides is an organisation which should protect girls from these sorts of pressures.’

Jill Kirby, an author and researcher specialising in social policy, said: ‘One of the reasons why girls want to join the Guides, and their parents are happy that they should do so, is that they can learn leadership qualities and escape from the sex and television culture.

‘I would have hoped that anyone leading the Guides would understand that. I don’t believe that Miss  Bentley does.’

The fpa was one of the leading  state-subsidised organisations which, under Tony Blair’s government, attempted to reduce teenage pregnancy rates.

Although levels did fall, the  campaign fell far short of its target of halving pregnancies among girls under 18.

It is currently selling a condom  demonstrator as part of a catalogue of ‘young people resources aged 11 and above’ alongside sex education leaflets for girls of 12 and over.

One booklet, called Sex, Love, Relationships, tells young readers they are ready for sex if they can answer ‘yes’ to four questions.

It says: ‘Ask yourself these questions: Do you want to have sex (for you, not for someone else)? Do you like, trust, respect your partner?

‘Are you prepared to take responsibility
for having safer sex? Are  you prepared for the possible  emotional 
rollercoaster of rejection  or break-up?’

The way we were: English Girl Guides in Hertfordshire in 1950

This year the organisation has opened an online shop, Desire And Pleasure, which sells a wide range of sex toys and aids alongside condoms. Items on sale include ‘bondage gear’.

Miss Bentley said in an interview with The Times: ‘Everyone has  heard of the Girl Guides but not  everyone understands that today it  is very different.

‘They are rooted to the image of what the Guides were years ago. I want to help the public understand what they Guides are now.

‘It is not about itchy brown uniforms and sewing and baking. It is a  modern, contemporary, vibrant organisation.

‘Guides in 2012 are more likely to be investigating a muddy ravine, going overseas to help on an Aids programme, or going to one of our pop concerts.’

Girlguiding UK is Britain’s largest voluntary organisation for girls and young women, with more than 500,000 members and recognised volunteers.

Over a third of girls and young women aged seven to 21  have been involved with the movement, with former Guides including Carol Vorderman and Emma Thompson.

There are now 31million Scouts and ten million Guides in 216 countries around the world.The organisation was formed before the First World War following the success of the Boy Scout movement, founded by Robert Baden-Powell.

The Boer War hero disapproved of girls and boys mixing freely and so encouraged his sister Agnes to set up a girls-only organisation.

It was named after a frontier regiment in the Indian Army.
