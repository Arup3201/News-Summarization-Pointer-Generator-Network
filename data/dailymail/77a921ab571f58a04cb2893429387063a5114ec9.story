Two thieves were part of a 'prolific and dangerous' organised gang that armed themselves with machetes and meat cleavers to intimidate people and steal jewellery, cars and cash.

Jack Hunter, 20, and Jamie Ellis, 24 were part of the organised group that terrorised people in Liverpool to steal cars, wallets and handbags and committed a number of cash in transit robberies.

Hunter took photos of bundles of cash the gang had stolen as well as pictures of himself, posing menacingly with a machete. He was jailed for his role in several burglaries, including one involving a pregnant woman.

Jack Hunter was part of a gang of armed raiders that equipped themselves with machetes and knives to steal jewellery, cars and cash. Hunter posted pictures of their spoils as well as him posing with one of the weapons

The pair were caught after boastful and brazen images of their spoils were sent to a gang member who was serving time in prison, where they were intercepted by prison staff and handed to police. 

The gang are believed to have targeted members of the Chinese community involved with restaurants because they believed they may have taken their takings home with them. This left a number of Chinese people in Merseyside living in fear of being attacked. 

Hunter, of Anfield, stole a number of cars from the Merseyside area including a VW Passatt, a VW Golf and a Jaguar XFS.

He was also part of a four-strong gang armed with knives and a meat cleaver who stole cash, wallets and handbags from the occupants of a house in Allerton, Liverpool.

Hunter took a number of intimidating pictures of himself when he had been involved in the robberies

Hunter was jailed for 16 years after previously being convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary.

Ellis, of Roby, took part in cash in transit robberies at the Showcase cinema on East Lancashire Road on November 25, 2013, and a McDonald's restaurant on Edge Lane on December 4, 2013.

He was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit cash in transit robberies.

Ellis received another 12 months each for three counts of handling stolen goods, to run concurrently, and a further 15 months in prison in relation to the breach of a previous suspended sentence.

DCI Tom Keaton of Merseyside Police said: 'Jack Hunter and Jamie Ellis were part of a prolific and dangerous organised crime group which carried out a string of burglaries, car thefts and cash in transit robberies.

'During November through to the early part of February, Hunter was part of a group responsible for a string of domestic burglaries both in Merseyside and Worcestershire, in which high value cars were often targeted.

'Hunter's criminality culminated in a robbery and an aggravated burglary in south Liverpool in which members of the Chinese community were targeted.

'The offenders armed themselves with a range of weapons, including knives, machetes and an axe, and didn't hesitate to subject their victims to truly horrific ordeals in which they were intimidated and threatened though thankfully not physically injured.

Pictures of bundles of cash stolen from people targeted by the prolific gang were taken 

'During one of these incidents, the gang threatened the occupants of a house, then forced a pregnant woman, her baby daughter and two elderly female relatives into the living room where they stole jewellery.'

The gang committed 12 burglaries in Merseyside and Worcester, three cash in transit robberies, two motor vehicle thefts and two offences of handling stolen goods.

The offences took place between November 2013 and February 2014.  

DCI Tom Keaton said they worked with members of the Chinese community across Merseyside to bring the offenders to justice. 

He added: 'Some of the pictures we have released show Jack Hunter appearing to glorify the use of weapons and showing delight in the results of the group's criminality.

'I'm convinced Merseyside is now a far safer place as these two offenders will be off the streets for a significant period of time.'

Members also took pictures of the watches and expensive jewellery that had stolen from people's homes

Designer handbags also formed part of the gangs spoils as they targeted homes and committed cash in transit robberies and thefts 

Craig Lister, Daniel Challinor and Marlene Currie pleaded guilty to various offences at a previous hearing in relation to the conspiracies and will be sentenced at a later date.

Head of community engagement, Chief Supt Rowley Moore, said: 'The offences against Chinese nationals living in Merseyside brought fear to what is a tight knit and very proud group of people.

'I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to their bravery and recognise the contribution the victims have made in providing evidence and securing these court results.

'We provided support throughout the justice process and also worked closely with senior members of those communities and a range of partners to provide reassurance and advice'
