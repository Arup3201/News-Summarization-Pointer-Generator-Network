The first buyers of Google's Glass wearable computer have been banned from selling or even lending the gadget to friends - even though they have paid almost £1,000 for it.

The wearable glasses have been given to developers who signed up at the firm's annual conference last year.

However, purchasers were stunned to find the small print banned them from giving away or even lending the gadget to friends.

The first buyers of Google's Glass wearable computer have been banned from selling or even lending the gadget to friends - even though they have paid almost £1,000 for it. It will not go on sale to the public until next year.

Several of the Glasses are also believed to have been put up for sale on eBay, but auctions were pulled down before they could be completed

'If you resell, loan, transfer, or give 
your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google 
reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the 
unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, 
product support, or product warranty,' the firm told buyers.

Glass must be connected to the internet via a wifi or bluetooth connection to work, allowing Google to keep tabs on which account it uses.

Once Glass is available to the general public — not just for the elite Glass Explorers — the sales terms will become more lenient, with buyers allowed to give them away: 'You may not commercially resell any device, but you may give the device as a gift,' Google writes.

Several of the Glasses are also believed to have been put up for sale on eBay, but auctions were pulled down before they could be completed.

Earlier this month the glasses were released to the first group of developers outside the company, known as 'Explorers', and the excited testers rushed to upload footage to YouTube that they captured wearing the devices

To use the first version of the glasses, users found they also need a mobile phone running Google's Android software - ruling out iPhone owners.

Google has created a special app, called MyGlass, which owners use to set up their device, and to use its key features - GPS and sending and receiving messages.

'The MyGlass companion app requires Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher.

'MyGlass enables GPS and SMS messaging,' Google says online.

It is unclear where an iPhone version will ever be made available.

The camera on the wearable computer 
shoots in 720p so the clips are impressively clear and the videos are 
whetting the appetite of early adopters eagerly awaiting the release of 
the device.

Google finally released the wearable 'Glass' computer it hopes could form the next massive shift in technology.

Google Glass was delivered to the first customers outside the company today, after they signed up last year to be the first to buy the ($1500) 'Explorer edition' of the gadget.

The firm says the high resolution display is the equivalent of a 25 inch high definition TV viewed from eight feet away - but warns that users will have to recharge their glasses every day.

What's in the box: The first developers received their Google Glass 'explorer editions' today, after signing up last year to buy the glasses. They are supplied with a 'sunglass' visor for the controversial glasses, which have already been banned by some establishments

One of the first to receive his Glass
was software developer Brandon Allgood, who posted a picture of himself
wearing the sunglass visor entitled 'Terminator!' to his Google+ page.

Extra nosepads in two sizes are included.

'This is what you get in the box: two visors, a bag, power cord and of course Google Glass!' he wrote.

Hundreds more are expected to be picking up their Glass in the coming days.

To set up their glasses, users have to scan a special barcode to link their glasses to their Google account.

The firm says the 'durable frame fits any face,' but also supplies nosepads in two sizes.

It
has also revealed the first details of the display used in Glass, 
claiming it is the equivalent of watching a 25-inch, high definition screen from 
eight feet away.

The glasses will also have 12 GB of usable memory, synced with Google's cloud storage.

The search giant also admitted the Glass battery may not last a full day for some users.

'Some features, like Hangouts and video recording, are more battery intensive,' it said.

Google also released the APIs programmers will need to create their own Glass apps.

The search giant is also set to open stores to show off Glass, according to 9to5mac.

'An extremely reliable source has confirmed to us that Google is in the process of building stand-alone retail stores in the U.S. and hopes to have the first flagship Google Stores open for the holidays in major metropolitan areas,' it said.

'Google feels right now that many potential customers need to get hands-on experience with its products before they are willing to purchase.'

According to Buzzfeed, 'Google is planning to open retail stores in Los Angeles and San Francisco, according to a source familiar with the plans.

'The company has already begun hiring staff, who are being trained in how to explain and market Google products — including Glass — in stores.'

However, the Glass technology has already caused controversy.

A
group of anonymous online protestors are targeting Google and users of 
the search engine company’s soon-to-be released Google Glass in an 
attempt to censor the high-tech eyewear and also make a little money in 
the process.

The group known as Stop The Cyborgs is ‘fighting the algorithmic future one bit at a time,’ according to its website banner.

The
site’s founders, who say they are working anonymously to keep Google 
from spying on them, also say they believe the new Google-manufactured 
eyewear will promote a world in which ‘privacy is impossible'.

Apple have also released the app lucky owners will use to set up the electronic eyewear

Glass is expected to go on sale to consumers later this year, costing around £800

The people behind the anti-cyborg movement say there is no way someone can ever know for sure that another person wearing Google Glass is not recording their every word and movement.

‘Gradually people will stop acting as autonomous individuals when making decisions and interacting with others, and instead become mere sensor/effector nodes of a global network,’ the site states.

The protestor group additionally runs a 'Stop The Cyborgs' store on its site, where online visitors can buy T-shirts and stickers that say ‘Google Glass is banned on these premises,’ and show images of Google Glass being crossed out.

However, on the site the group admits: 'Please note that Google has not yet officially released the details of how Google Glass will work', adding that their privacy concerns are 'educated speculation based on public press articles'.

Glass will also be available in five different colours when it eventually goes on sale to consumers

'Google Glass is a technical masterpiece,' he said.

'It
combines numerous functions and features in a very small unit. In 
addition to phone and camera (photo, video), it offers Internet 
connection, including GPS.'

'The core feature of Google Glass is a visual layer that is placed over the reality ('augmented reality'), explains Missfeldt.

'This layer opens a door to amazing new possibilities.

'Google Glass contains a 
mini-projector, which projected the layer via a clever, semi-transparent
prism directly on the retina in the eye.

'Because of this the image, even though it is so close to the eye, is sharp and clear.

'You can move the front part of the Google Glass easily to optimize the focus.'
