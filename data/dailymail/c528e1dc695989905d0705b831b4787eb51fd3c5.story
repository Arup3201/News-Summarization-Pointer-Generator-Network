When a policeman noticed driver Sophie Vaughan sipping a Slush Puppie in a traffic jam, he could have let her off with a simple lecture on road safety.

But instead he handed her a £100 fine and three penalty points – after calling three  colleagues on his radio for back-up.

Account manager Miss Vaughan, 22, was on her way to lunch with a friend in Carshalton, South London, when she got stuck in a traffic jam.

Pulled over: Ms Vaughan was driving her convertible Ford Ka at 11.30am last Friday when she sipped the drink

She took a sip of her raspberry Slush Puppie drink while she was waiting, and thought nothing of it.

But a policeman passing on a bike spotted her and called in three more officers – one on a bike and two in a van.

He then gave her a £100 fixed penalty fine for driving without due care and attention.

Miss Vaughan, from Wallington, South London, said: ‘It’s so petty and ridiculous. It was only a tiny sip. I wasn’t even moving.

‘I’m outraged. And talk about overkill – to have four police officers dealing with such a petty thing is a joke.’

After having been a driver for four years without so much as a parking fine, Miss Vaughan was nabbed with the ice drink in her Ford Ka convertible at 11.30am last Friday.

She vowed to appeal after also getting three penalty points on her previously clean licence.

A
 spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘Any person who believes 
they have been unjustly issued with a fixed penalty notice has the right
 to appeal against this through the courts.’

The law does not specify whether eating or drinking while driving is illegal, and whether drivers have committed by doing so depends on how it affected their driving.

According to advice from the RAC, drinking a soft drink while on the road is only an offence 'if you present a significant danger' and if the police think 'you are not in proper control of the vehicle.

A study from Leeds University has shown that drivers consuming drinks at the wheel went 22 per cent more slowly than average, but were also 18 per cent more likely to show erratic lane control.

Guidelines published by the CPS do not mention food or drink in relation to driving without due care and attention - but they mention that any act which causes a driver to be 'avoidably distracted' could constitute an offence.

This is in contrast to more specific laws which exist around other potential distractions such as mobile phones - the use of which attracts an instant penalty.
