A Michigan woman says she found a worm inside her son's Capri Sun juice pouch. 

Emmie Field said she took a sip of her son Carter's fruit punch-flavored juice pouch before giving it to him on Sunday, since he often spills it when its full. 

She felt something solid in her mouth and spit it out in the sink, then spotted a white, wiggling worm in the discarded liquid, she told the Livingston Daily Press & Argus.

Field said she purchased the drink from a Walmart in Fowlerville. She said her four-year-old daughter had already consumed two other pouches out of the same package and entire other box of Capri Sun pouches that were purchased on the same date. 

'Of course I called the doctor and asked if this is something I need to be worried about,' she told the Daily Press & Argus. 'The doctor said they should be fine unless they start puking.'

Field also called Kraft Foods, which makes Capri Sun. The company told her that the worm was probably mold. 

'Mold doesn't have a head like this or wiggle,' she argued.

Field has kept the worm in a small plastic bag. Officials from Kraft are traveling to her home in Howell Township to inspect the evidence and remaining juice pouches. 

In a statement to the Daily Press & Argus, Kraft maintained that the 'worm' is likely mold. 

'The mold takes the form of a straw, which can then be mistaken as a worm since it is long and thin,' the statement read.
