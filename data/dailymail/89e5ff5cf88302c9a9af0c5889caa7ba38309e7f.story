Britain now lags behind Burundi, South Africa, Rwanda and Latvia in gender equality. File picture

Britain has dropped behind developing countries in a global report on gender equality.

In the Global Gender Gap Report, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Britain has dropped eight spots to 26th place - lagging behind Latvia, Burundi, South Africa, Rwanda and Nicaragua.

The report, which covered 142 countries, looked at how nations distribute access to healthcare, education, political participation and resources and opportunities between women and men.

The UK was ranked ninth in the first report in 2006 and has dropped through the ranking ever since. It is believed changes in income estimates are behind the fall.

Just five of the FTSE 100 companies have women in the top spot.

Ann Francke, the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, told the Guardian: 'The issue in the UK is that while there are more women in the workplace they tend to be in the lower level positions.

'The pay gap continues to be alarmingly large for men and women doing the same senior role.'

The Nordic countries - Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark - were the most equal.

They were joined by Nicaragua, Rwanda Ireland, the Philippines and Belgium in the top 10, while Yemen remained at the bottom of the chart for the ninth year in a row.

The United States meanwhile climbed three spots from last year to 20th, after narrowing its wage gap and hiking the number of women in parliamentary and ministerial level positions.

France catapulted from 45th to 16th place, also due to a narrowing wage gap but mainly thanks to increasing numbers of women in politics, including near-parity in the number of government ministers.

With 49 per cent women ministers, France now has one of the highest ratios in the world.

Among other large economies, Brazil stood at 71st place, Russia at 75th, China at 87th and India at 114, the report showed.

Almost all the countries had made progress towards closing the gap in access to healthcare, with 35 nations filling it completely, while 25 countries had shut the education access gap, the report showed.

Even more than in the workplace, political participation lagged stubbornly behind, with women still accounting for just 21 percent of the world's decision makers, according to the report.

Yet this was the area where most progress had been made in recent years.

'In the case of politics, globally, there are now 26 percent more female parliamentarians and 50 percent more female ministers than nine years ago,' said the report's lead author, Saadia Zahidi.

'These are far-reaching changes,' she said, stressing though that much remained to be done and that the 'pace of change must in some areas be accelerated'.

The report also found inequality at work is not expected to be erased until 2095 and had barely narrowed in the past nine years.

Since 2006, when the WEF first began issuing its annual Global Gender Gap Reports, women have seen their access to economic participation and opportunity inch up to 60 per cent of that of men's, from 56 per cent.

'Based on this trajectory, with all else remaining equal, it will take 81 years for the world to close this gap completely,' the WEF said in a statement.

The world would be better served to speed up the process, according to WEF founder and chief Klaus Schwab.

'Achieving gender equality is obviously necessary for economic reasons. Only those economies who have full access to all their talent will remain competitive and will prosper,' he said.
