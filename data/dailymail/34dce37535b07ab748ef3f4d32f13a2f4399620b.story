A convicted school shooter and two other Ohio inmates managed to get inside a prison's maintenance area and spent several months building a makeshift ladder to escape, it has been revealed.

T.J Lane, 20, who is serving a life sentence for killing three of his classmates at Chardon High School near Cleveland in 2012, then used it to scale the fence of Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima before jumping 15 feet to freedom in September.

Along with Lindsey Bruce and Clifford E. Opperud, they dispersed and ran through the fields surrounding the facility, but the trio were all caught within hours.

Bid for freedom: Video footage shows two inmates, one of them convicted school shooter T.J Lane breaking out of Allen Oakwood Correctional Institute in Lima, Ohio

The three prisoners, one had run in a different direction used a makeshift ladder built inside the prison's maintenance unit to scale the fence before jumping 15ft to freedom 

Caught: Lindsey Bruce, who kidnapped and killed a five-year-old girl in 2004, was the first to be caught just minutes after he had scaled the prison walls 

The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction's investigation also found that a security camera at the unit where the escape happened wasn't working because of an earlier lightning strike and that some lighting near the prison needed to be repaired.

Lane, who wore a T-shirt with the word 'killer' scrawled on it at his sentencing hearing last year, was captured in a wooded area about six hours after the prison break on September 11. 

Reports suggested that he armed himself with a pitchfork during the escape attempt.  

Bruce, who is serving a life sentence for killing a five-year-old girl, was found within minutes just outside.

The third Clifford E. Opperud, sentenced to 12 years for a home invasion, was discovered hiding under a boat across the road nine hours after the escape.

T.J. Lane, who was convicted of killing three of his classmates in a school cafeteria was one of the prisoners who tried to escape by building a ladder and scaling the fence . He wore a t-shirt saying killer during his sentencing and was disrespectful to the victims' families  

A video released by the corrections department showed all three running through a soybean field just outside the prison fence.

The inmates were able to open a padlock on a door to the maintenance area, the report said. They got into a maintenance access area, described in the report as being similar to a crawl space, where they built the ladder.

Fifteen months before the escape a prison guard wrote in a report that he found discarded wooden cabinets in the maintenance access area, according to the internal investigation.

The state's investigation did not say what the ladder was built from or how the inmates were able to move it without being detected. The recreation yard where the escape took place has been closed.

The prison department said it has since repaired lighting at the prison, updated the alarm system and added razor ribbon on top of the administration building and other areas.

The state also has reassigned the warden at the prison and demoted the deputy warden.

All three inmates involved in the escape have since been moved to the so-called Supermax state prison in Youngstown.

Lane wasn't charged with escape because he has no chance to be released and the families of his victims didn't want him to have an opportunity to mock them again, a prosecutor said last month.

Lindsey Bruce, who also is serving a life sentence, was not charged with escape either. Clifford Opperud was sentenced just over a week ago to five additional years. He was already serving time for robbery, burglary and kidnapping.

In addition to at least three other offenses for which Lane has been punished in past months, the cold-blooded teen killer has been found guilty of the following disorderliness:

August 2014: Lane was cited for urinating on an Allen Correctional Institution prison wall

October 2013: Lane disobeyed a prison work order and lost 10 days recreation time

August 2013: Lane refused to follow through with a work assignment and was verbally reprimanded

July 2013: Lane was separated from the general population for 10 days as punishment for giving himself a tattoo

Changes: The warden at Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio, has been reassigned following the escape effort and their deputy has been demoted 

Precautions: The authorities announced that more barbed wire would be installed around the prison in the wake of the escape
