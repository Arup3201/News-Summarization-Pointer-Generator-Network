For property owners in a crowded country like China, adding a roof extension could be the perfect way to expand their homes or businesses.

But pity the neighbours of this man, who, not content with a simple skylight, added two whole houses on top of his factory.

And is if that wasn't bad enough, the red-brick villas are supported only by flimsy looking concrete stilts.

Now that's what I call a loft extension! Hong Kong businessman has added two villas to the top of his three storey factory

The two villas are a mirror image of one another and are supported by only thin concrete stilts

These astonishing pictures from 
Dongguan, in Guangdong Province, southern China, show the results of an 
ambitious building project by one Hong Kong businessman.

Incredibly
the man actually got planning permission from the local authority to 
build on top of the original three-storey grey building, and residents 
claim the extension has been in place for years.

However,
following media attention and a careful look at the property, planning officers have decided that the end result doesn't quite match the
blueprints which were submitted.

They have ordered the dangerous structures to be torn down, warning that they could fall into the factory below.

In a statement they said: 'They were built without permission and they will be demolished before they can fall down.'

These 'chateaus in the clouds' join a growing list of illegal DIY jobs
that have capped city high-rises throughout China, such as the
mountaintop villa in Beijing.

Workers have now demolished a Beijing roof-top mountain villa after residents of the 26-storey apartment block complained of cracked walls and damaged pipes

Professor Zhang Biqing built the 8,610 square-foot structure on top of a 26-storey apartment block without permission and was ordered to tear it down in August.

Residents said that there was only a small loft apartment there when he bought it, but he quickly installed a rock garden, swimming pool and villa in its place.

Neighbours complained of cracks in their walls and leaking pipes caused by the extra weight.
