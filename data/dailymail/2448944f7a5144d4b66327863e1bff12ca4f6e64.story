Uruguay defender Diego Godin insists his side will not be underestimating England at the World Cup despite the lack of hype around Roy Hodgson's squad.

The Three Lions join Uruguay, Italy and Costa Rica in Group D and face La Celeste in their second match on June 19.

Expectations surrounding England's prospects in Brazil are lower than they have been in living memory and the players have been careful to avoid entering into any undue hyperbole in public.

Godin, a Champions League runner-up and Primera Division winner with Atletico Madrid this season, has noted the lack of talk from the English camp but believes they will play a big part in a group where he expects no easy matches.

'We have been given a group with very strong teams,' Godin told a press conference in Montevideo.

'England do not talk much but I think it is a very strong team with players going through a great time.

'They are at a high level and it is going to be very difficult.

'Italy are always a favourite to win in past World Cups and we faced them in the Confederations Cup. And Costa Rica is our debut match in Brazil, the first game is always difficult and it is a grand final because it is so important for the group.'

Godin also offered his latest thoughts on the national obsession that is Luis Suarez's fitness.

Positive: Godin says Suarez has been 'upbeat' about his chances of being fit for the World Cup

The Liverpool striker is touch and go for the tournament after undergoing knee surgery at the end of the Barclays Premier League season, but the recent news from the camp is that the star striker is progressing well and hopes to be fit for at least some of the group stages.

'I took it the same way we all took it, like a bucket of cold water,' he said.

'Nobody expected it but from the moment I contacted him I have been serene, because his message was upbeat and positive.'
