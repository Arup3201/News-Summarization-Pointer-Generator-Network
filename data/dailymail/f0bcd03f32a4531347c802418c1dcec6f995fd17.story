Lassana Diarra is poised to join QPR this week after being sacked by Lokomotiv Moscow.

The 29-year-old has been in dispute with Lokomotiv coach Leonid Kuchuk and refused to turn up for training.

Exasperated by the stand-off, the Russian club have taken action and Diarra is heading for London in the hope of signing again for Harry Redknapp.

Sacked: Diarra had his contract terminated after refusing to train following a disagreement with the coach

Sportsmail revealed Rangers' interest earlier this month with the sticking point Diarra's £80,000-a-week salary.

However, he is ready to compromise his demands to push through a deal and link up with Redknapp who was his boss at Portsmouth.

QPR remain interested in signing a goalkeeper also with Reading's Alex McCarthy an option.

They have also been offered Guingamp striker Mustapha Yatabare, 28, but a deal is unlikely at this stage.
