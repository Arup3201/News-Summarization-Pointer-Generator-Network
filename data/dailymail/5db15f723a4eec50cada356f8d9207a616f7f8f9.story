A disabled Florida artist may find himself homeless early in the new year, if he is thrown out of his current house in Sarasota County by his own sister.

Roger Skelton, 62, was hit by drunk driver in 1980, living him with a severe traumatic brain injury.

While the motor skills on the left side of his body were permanently affected, Skelton began painting in 1994 and is gaining recognition as a watercolor artist. But Virginia Greenwood, one of his five siblings, served him with an eviction notice on December 11.

According to ABC 7, his sister is unhappy with the fact that Skelton has got a roommate, something that Greenwood informed him was not allowed in November.

He claims: 'She wants to be in control of my living situation and that is not going to happen.'

Skelton says he has paid rent on time for the last seven years but was served a notice from the sheriff's officer earlier in the month.

'I got a five day notice that I needed to do something,' he told ABC 7. Skelton admits that the property is his sister's house and she 'can do what she wants', but says he needs more time.

Skelton's apartment also doubles as his studio and he says it would be devastating if his artwork was thrown onto the streets.

Following the car accident 32 years ago, he hasn't been able to write or drive so he turned to art. 'It is therapeutic is what I would call it. I like the fact that I can do it,' Skelton said.

On his blog, Skelton says that he often depicts tropical scenes using Caribbean colors, inspired by the seven years he spent in the Bahamas as a child. Recently, Skelton has begun to sell some of paintings.

Roger's sister, Virginia Greenwood, told ABC 7 that she has worked to help Roger over the years and got a second job as the rent doesn't cover the mortgage.

Greenwood claims that she doesn't want to do that for Skelton's roommate and that the dispute has been going on for some time.

Elizabeth Boyle of Gulf Coast Legal Services, an organization that provides free legal aid in Tampa Bay, said this was a 'very unusual' case.

'If the sister wanted to get the house because she was in dire need and needed the money that would be a whole different question. I don't think that is what I am hearing here,' Boyle added.

Both brother and sister will be hoping a resolution can be found over the holiday season.
