Lukas Podolski's loan spell at Inter Milan has been far from impressive, and the Arsenal man could find himself back in north London come the summer.

The 29-year-old German forward was shipped out to Serie A in January but has failed to net on nine occasions for Roberto Mancini's side, and his agent has revealed that a move back to the Emirates could be on the cards.

'Anything could happen,' Ali Pektas told Fanatik. 'Last summer he could have moved to Galatasaray, but it never materialised. Every summer Lukas and I go on holiday to Turkey.

Despite working hard at training, Lukas Podolski has struggled to make an impact on loan at Inter Milan

'For the moment he's on loan at Inter, and when it ends at the end of the season he could return to Arsenal, where he still has a year on his contract.

'With regard to his future, all I can say is that anything could happen, even a transfer to Turkey. Why not? He appreciates [Turkish football] a lot, and he wants to keep playing at a high level.'

Podolski was this week rated as the second-worst Serie A signing of the season in a poll conducted by Gazzetta dello Sport, but he is not fazed by the criticism being levelled at him.

He told Sport1: You need to swallow [criticism] in professional football. There is always another direction, meaning a positive one.

'I don't care for media or people being critical of me. I know that this is part of the business. It's important to know what you have to do to be better.

Podolski was given an opportunity to start Inter's crunch clash with Fiorentina on Sunday, but was hauled off in the second half after another lacklustre performance. 

A particular low point of the match came when Podolski kicked the flag while taking a corner and miskicked the ball, which failed to reach the penalty area and was intercepted to set up a Fiorentina counter-attack.
