A girl nicknamed ‘garbage disposal’ at school has realized a childhood dream by becoming a beauty queen - despite weighing more than 300 pounds.

Victoria Christensen used to watch with envy as her slim sisters entered competitions, thinking she would never experience that feeling of triumph.

Now, however, the married woman has been crowned  Mrs Utah Plus America 2012 at the age of 23.

Ms Christensen grew up watching the Miss America pageant every year and wishing she could be one of the girls on the stage.

To make matters worse, while she was taunted by school bullies, her petite sisters regularly scooped prizes in regional beauty competitions.

After years of suffering, she decided she would not let size get in the way of her dreams, and entered Mrs Plus America, a beauty pageant specifically for larger women.

She missed out on the national title, but was named Mrs Utah Plus, gaining the confidence to be proud of her curves.

She said: 'I used to watch the Miss America pageant as a child and wished I could be one of those girls.

New outlook: The young woman said she might never have pursued her dream without the encouragement of her husband

'I had decided that I was never going to be skinny enough or pretty enough to do that so year after year I would watch them and continue to wish.

'At school people commonly called me "fat" and "fatty" - the worst was "garbage disposal" because people thought I ate too much.

‘I don’t remember anything more than that because I’ve tried to let them go and remove any negative forces in my life.

'My gorgeous sisters are 10 and 16 years older than me and I remember going to a few local parades and seeing them with beautiful dresses and people waving at them - I wanted to be that girl.'

Miss Christensen, who works in home automation support for appliances and lighting, was browsing Facebook one day when she stumbled across a link to an interview with the Mrs Plus America 2011 winner.

All that glitters: The 23-year-old had watched her slim sisters Dawn, back, and Jennifer, front, compete in pageants without any hope it would one day be her turn

'My first thought was "wait a minute - plus?"' she said. 'I realised I had a chance to be one of the girls I thought I would never be skinny enough or pretty enough to be.

'I was obviously anxious but my amazing husband Fred encouraged me and kept on telling me it would be all right and he really wanted to see me do this.

'I spoke to the wonderful organisers and when Fred saw my expression each time I spoke with them, he pushed me more. I remember feeling accepted for the first time.

'Not too long after I entered, I noticed myself being more confident. About two months before the pageant Fred walked in on me in the bathroom crying and asked me what was the matter.

Long journey: Ms Christensen said she cried when she looked in the mirror and liked what she saw for the first time

'I explained that for the first time in my life I could look into the mirror and actually like what I see looking back.

'I realised I was becoming what I’d wanted to see in myself for my whole life.

'I want to send out a positive message about feeling confident with who you are.

'Miss Plus America changed my life and helped me see what a woman should be. It has turned me from a girl into a woman and given me the strength to accept myself and shine.

'I may not have finished first overall but this was my first ever pageant and I’m not ready to give up or stop anytime soon.'
