Tech experts, analysts and customers alike have bemoaned Apple's Watch for needing an iPhone to have any real use. 

But the firm has since confirmed the device will ship with 8GB of storage, and at least 2GB of this will be free for music and photos.

Although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs, it does mean the timepiece can be used independently for certain tasks.

Apple has confirmed that all three models of its Watch will ship with 8GB of storage, and at least 2GB will be free for music and photos. Although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs, it does mean the timepiece (pictured) can be used independently for certain tasks. The remaining storage will be used for apps and iOS

The number of tracks it can store will also vary depending on the file sizes.  

Apple confirmed the storage rumours to fan site 9to5Mac but the company has not responded to MailOnline's request for more information. 

All three models of the watch will ship with 8GB of total storage. This will be used to run the Watch's iOS software and apps. 

To put this into perspective, the entry-level iPhone 5C came with 8GB of storage when it launched in 2013 and rival smartwatches typically only have 4GB built-in.  

Apple will then let users store 2GB of music and 75MB of photos on the Watch as well. This music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its iPod Shuffle. 

The photo limit equates to around 100 images. 

To put this into perspective, the entry-level iPhone 5C came with 8GB of storage when it launched in 2013, and rival smartwatches typically only have 4GB built-in. Users can additionally store 75MB images, or 100 photos. The music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its iPod Shuffle (pictured)

Apple's Watch is available in three models: the Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition (shown) and all models will be sold in 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. Apple Watch is made of stainless steel, Sport is made of Aluminum and the premium Edition comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold

This music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them. 

The features of the Apple Watch rely heavily on pairing it with an iPhone. 

To connect to a phone it either has to be within Bluetooth range or connected to the same Wi-Fi network. 

It can't take photos because it doesn't have a built-in camera but it can be used to view pictures in the Photo Stream.

 

With a phone:

1. Use the phone's network to browse the web

2. Make and receive calls

3. Send and receive messages 

4. See notifications

5. Use any installed app including Uber, Shazam and more 

Without a phone:  

1. Tell the time

2. Track steps using the built-in accelerometer

3. Pay for goods using Apple Pay

4. Dictate messages to be sent once the phone is connected

5. Play up to 2GB of songs 

Although they will still need to wear Bluetooth headphones. 

The low photo limit may be because Apple doesn't want wearers to use the device for looking at pictures. 

The Watch is meant to be a companion device and the photos will be more visible on the larger screen of an iPhone and iPad. 

It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all models are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions.

It has been designed to be tethered to an iPhone and the pair communicate over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi which gives the Watch added computing power.

But this relationship means that as soon as the iPhone is out of the equation, the Watch has limited value.

The Watch also falls short of its rival’s Samsung Gear S that has an optional nano SIM card slot.

The Apple Watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version. 

Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum and ranges from $349 to $399. 

The premium Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold. Prices start at $10,000. 

In the UK, the Sport starts at £299, the standard Watch starts at £479 and the Edition model will cost from £8,000. 

This music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch (example app pictured) while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them. Although they will still need to wear Bluetooth headphones

Reviews of the Apple Watch have mostly been positive but while some have said it’s the best smartwatch on the market, the biggest criticism have been its lack of independent features - so this storage option will be a welcomed addition.

Ernest Doku, technology expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: ‘The Apple reveal finally answered all of our questions on pricing and availability, but the all-important "why" remained elusive.

‘Apple is asking us to pay for a level of technical craftsmanship and prestige - but this is unchartered territory and Apple is stepping into one of the few arenas where it’s still outclassed.’ 

But Stephen Ebbett from Protect Your Bubble added: ‘Sales will be driven by the novelty factor as well as the draw of brand Apple. Plus it has an exceptional track record.

‘Apple made us buy into the tablet in our millions when sceptics questioned whether there’d be enough demand. There’s no reason it can’t do the same again.’
