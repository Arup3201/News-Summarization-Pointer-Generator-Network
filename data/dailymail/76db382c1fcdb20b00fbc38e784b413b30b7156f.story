A dog fell 300ft from a cliff while chasing seagulls but escaped with just a slight limp.

Claire Morris and her husband Mark Russell thought their collie Iggy would not survive the plunge at Beachy Head in East Sussex.

Mrs Morris, 50, from Haslemere, Surrey, said: ‘We got on our bellies and began peering over the cliff edge.

Iggy the black and white collie survived with nothing more than a slight limp after falling 300ft

'We spotted this teeny tiny little spot walking around. 

‘It was high tide. I have no idea how he survived. He must have landed in the water in just the right place and at the right angle.’

The dog's owner described the moment as 'like like a scene from cartoon Tom and Jerry' when Iggy hovered over the edge - then disappeared.

'Iggy likes to chase birds and he was looking up at this seagull when he started to chase it,' she added.

'Because he was looking up he didn’t see the edge of the cliff and he just disappeared. It was horrible. I was howling and it was just awful.'

Iggy is the 11th dog to fall on the coastline this year - and the first to survive since 2010.

Claire Morris and her husband Mark Russell were full of praise for the rescue teams who helped reunite them with Iggy

Claire, who works in information services for the NHS, said: 'It was a very traumatic experience for Iggy but there are no signs of damage.

'We went back at the weekend to thank the RNLI but he was very nervous when he knew where we were.

'If we had seen a notice saying to put your dog on a lead we would have done so because when he takes off he just goes.

'We were 20 to 30 metres from the edge but there were no signs.

'I cannot praise the RNLI enough for their help rescuing Iggy. Their work is amazing, especially as they are volunteers.'
