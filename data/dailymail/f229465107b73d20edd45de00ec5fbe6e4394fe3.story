It might have looked like the most flagrant case of tapping-up since Jose Mourinho met Ashley Cole in London’s Royal Garden Hotel in 2005 but it seems Gerard Pique’s Sunday evening meeting with his former Barcelona boss was simply the ultimate ‘Pep talk’.

Pique has become increasingly exasperated by his situation at Barcelona and just 24 hours after another afternoon sitting on the sidelines in his new capacity as Luis Enrique’s fourth-choice centre back; who better to seek out for advice than Pep Guardiola. 

The Bayern boss was in the Catalan capital to cast his vote in the unofficial referendum on independence at the weekend and the two met and embraced in a quiet residential street close to Guardiola’s Barcelona home, the image was captured by a passing fan and soon spread throughout social media.

In Pique’s favour, most Barcelona supporters – even those that feel his form has slipped considerably since the heady days of 2009-2012  – feel that Luis Enrique is picking on his defender without justification.

Barcelona’s lack-lustre midfield is crying out for Javier Mascherano to take up the conductor’s baton. That move would free-up a space in the centre of defence for Pique to return to the first team for the first time since the Clasico.

Luis Enrique has denied he has anything personal against Pique. However, the images of him warming up on Saturday against Almeria only to sit back down again almost immediately as the coach made the decision to bring on Xavi Hernandez only added to the impression that all is not well between the two.

And if you can’t talk to the current coach then talk to the old one, the most-decorated in the club’s history.

Pique blossomed under Guardiola who encouraged his coming out with the ball from the back which was a feature of Barca’s best football and has been seen less and less in recent seasons as the gap between the Barcelona defence and the rest of the team has got slowly wider.

Pique will start Spain’s European Championship qualifier against Belarus on Saturday and then against Germany in Vigo next week and the suggestion is that Luis Enrique is then preparing to give his centre-back a clean slate when he returns playing him in the run-up to the winter break.

If the reunification between the two fails then January will bring plenty of suitors to Pique’s door. 

Although the club is banned from signing players, it still seems unlikely that Barca would sell Pique in January knowing that they are prohibited from bringing in a replacement.
