A British man has been arrested after he ran over and killed a  noodle seller in Thailand while allegedly travelling at high speed.

Thai police said Andrew Mclaren, 67, was going too fast when he hit local streetside seller Dul Libbao, 46, on the Sukhumvit road in  Sattahip in the Southeast Asian country's Chonburi region.

Mr Libbao, who had been crossing the road, was killed almost instantly.

Inspector Pichitpong Yodpikul, from the local police force, said: 'We had a call to say the person was lying on footpath and dispatched a patrol car and an ambulance immediately.

'We located the body of the noodle vendor who had been killed by a car after suffering fatal head injuries.

'The car that had caused the accident was a Honda Jazz that had ended up being parked to some 50 metres from the body and there was considerable damaged to the car's bumper and windscreen.'

Insp Yodpikul witnesses had seen Mclaren's blue Honda travelling at high speed before it hit the noodle seller.

The pensioner, from England, has since been arrested and  charged with reckless driving and causing death with dangerous driving, he added.
