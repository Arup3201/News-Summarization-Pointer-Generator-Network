Teachers have apologised to parents after a group of primary school children were forced to stay in the canteen until they had finished all the food on their plates.

Parents of children attending Kaizen Primary School in Plaistow, East London, were left fuming after a group of pupils, some as young as five, were told they had to clear their plates before being allowed out into the playground.

Even though years ago parents would not have batted an eyelid and would have welcomed schools encouraging their children to eat, dozens of parents complained, saying that children should 'not be forced to eat' by teachers.

Candeece Kenlock said her five-year-old son Kehyan was 'so scared' of being forced to eat everything on his plate he didn't want to go to school anymore.

She said: 'He was crying and saying that the kids couldn't scrape any food into the bin.

'I've been finding food hidden down the table and in tissues at home. It's like he's picked up habits from school.'

Another mother, who wanted only to be known as Jo, said she was now making packed lunches for her two sons so they didn't have to eat school dinners.

She said: 'My boys came home in tears because they were forced to eat all their peas.

'All the parents have been talking about it. It's like going back to the dark ages.'

Another mother who did not want to be named, said: 'They really should not be forcing children to eat everything on their plate.

'If a child is full or really doesn't want to finish their school dinner they should be allowed to leave the food and go an play, not be told to clear their plate and being effectively locked in the canteen.'

The two headteachers of the 440-pupil school, Rebekah Iiyambo and Mitch Karunaratne, have reassured parents that the teacher in question had been spoken to and have promised it 'won't happen again'.

In a statement from the school they stated: 'There was a one-off incident where a member of staff kept a small number of pupils in the dining hall because they were concerned the children in question had not eaten enough of their school lunch to sustain them throughout the day.

'We have spoken to this staff member, who was acting in the best interests of the pupils, and we can promise this won't happen again.

'We have already reassured a number of parents who came to us concerned.

'We are always happy to talk to parents if they have any concerns about school lunches or any of our policies.'
