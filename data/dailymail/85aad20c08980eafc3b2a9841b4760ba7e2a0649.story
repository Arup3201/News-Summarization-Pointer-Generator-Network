Without a trace: Helen Holladay, 45, was last seen alive leaving her mobile home in Texas after a fight with her husband on September 29, 1979

A human skeleton found inside a truck pulled from a North Texas lake has been tentatively identified as a woman who went missing 35 years ago after a fight with her husband.

A passerby discovered the partially exposed 1973-model Chevy pickup in Lake Granbury after the lake's water level dropped, thanks to the state's ongoing drought, and revealed a portion of the vehicle.

The truck was found far away from any road or parking lot near the lake, and investigators ‘don't believe it was an accident,’ Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds said.

While inspecting the truck’s cab, investigators found human skeletal remains, pieces of clothing and a purse containing objects with Helen Holladay's name on them.

Holladay was 45 years old when she disappeared in September 1979. Her husband, Herman, was a suspect in her disappearance but was never charged. He died in 1987 - a year after his wife was officially declared deceased.

According to people who knew the couple back in the 1970s, the two had a very volatile relationship punctuated by instances of domestic violence.

Authorities have notified Holladay’s two surviving daughters, but the results of DNA tests will likely take about two months.

Deputies had responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at the Holladays' mobile home the night she went missing September 29, 1979.

Witnesses reported seeing Helen Holladay leaving the house and driving away, though there was not enough evidence to charge her husband, Deeds said.

The rusted out truck was discovered at around 11.30am Thursday by a Granbury city worker.

NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported the Chevy was found near the Lake Bridge on Business 377 in Granbury, its condition so badly deteriorated that officials have been unable to make out the license plate number.

The truck had spent more than 30 years submerged in 15 feet of water, but the drought caused the lake levels to drop, uncovering the front and rear sections of the vehicle, according to CBS DFW.

The cabin of the pickup truck contained Mrs Holladay's purse with her credit card still inside.

Deeds noted
 that investigators searched the lake numerous times with sonar 
following Holladay's disappearance, but the murky waters and the fact 
that the truck was covered in silt made it nearly impossible for divers 
to spot it.

But Texas' record-breaking drought has brought the lake to its lowest levels in years.

Initial
 inspection of the skeletal remains revealed no signs of trauma, but 
detectives can't yet say whether foul play was involved in her death, 
Deeds said.

‘It's still too early in the investigation to rule in one direction or the other,’ he said, adding that a forensic investigator with the University of North Texas at Denton is expected to inspect the remains.

Holladay's daughter, Karen Boatwright Stuart, 60, described her stepfather, Herman Holladay, as a violent and abusive man who had sent her mother to the hospital on multiple occasions.

‘I don’t know this for a fact, but I’ve always thought that Herman Holladay did something to her,’ the woman told the Star-Telegram.

According to the daughter, Mrs Holladay had made several attempts to leave her husband, but every time he would force her to come back, threatening her that he would kill her and take away her property.

Ms Boatwright Stuart recalled that after her mother's disappearance, her grandparents went by the Holladays' motor home and came upon a disturbing scene inside.

‘My grandmother said that blood was running down the door,’ the daughter said.
