ITV has been forced to stop airing The Only Way Is Essex before the watershed because of its sexual language and content.

The action was taken after a viewer saw an episode of the reality show one afternoon last August and complained to broadcasting watchdogs that young children could have been exposed to the programme's adult themes and swearing.

The episode was originally aired at 10pm but repeated at Sunday lunchtime on ITV2.

The watchdog found that producers used 20 bleeps during the half-hour episode to block out offensive language.

But Ofcom said 'the bleeping of the words was not always sufficient to mask the language or its impact'.

ITV is to stop scheduling the show – which stars Sam Faiers and has introduced slang such as vajazzle (to decorate a woman's genital area with crystals) to a wider public – during the day at weekends or during school holidays.

Inappropriate: Stars of the show had open conversations about sex and drinking

During the episode in question, two men Charlie and Chris, discussed women in a nightclub.

Charlie said: 'I like the curvaceous type – a little bit of junk in that trunk.'

Chris replied: 'Sounds like every man likes a bit of boobage, bit of bum.'

He adds: 'You see, I never talk to a girl with the eyes. I'm looking down seeing what they've got to offer… You need to just pounce on your prey and just penetrate.'

Other offensive material included conversations about STI tests and getting 'totally smashed', and characters making sexual gestures with their hands.

The watchdog concluded that ITV had breached the rule that children must be protected by appropriate scheduling from material that is unsuitable for them.

ITV have previously been reprimanded over voting issues on Britain's Got Talent. Viewers were unable to vote via smartphone despite having paid for the correct apps.

The broadcasting company has also been under fire in recent years over the flagship show The X Factor's risque performances from female pop stars.
