The six-month-old girl with a rare genetic disorder and a ‘bucket list’ blog created by her parents died of complications from the disease yesterday, her father wrote today.

Avery Lynn Canahuati was born in November with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA) and was given only months to live.

Her father Mike had chronicled his daughter’s life in a blog, writing in her voice about all the things she wanted to do before she died, including wearing a big bow and going to a tea party.

On the blog, Mr Canahuati wrote that 
their daughter passed away on Monday after one of her lungs collapsed. 
The infant then went into cardiac arrest.

He wrote: ‘Avery’s passing this 
quickly came as a complete shock to all of us, as she had just been 
given a thumbs up at her last doctor’s appointment only three days ago.’

He then shared a note ‘written by’ 
Avery, that was heartbreakingly hopeful. The note thanks everyone for 
their prayers and support, and reads: ‘When people think of me, I they 
will not waste time sitting there feeling sorry for me, rather I hope 
they will STAND UP in honour of me and all my friends.

‘They can do so by spreading awareness and helping to fund a cure for my friends.’

Mr Canahuati said on his blog that he 
could now scratch off of Avery’s bucket list. One, ‘Not let SMA take my 
smile away,’ and two, ‘Take one last breath, then take one more before I
 go to live with my Uncle Bryant, Nana Carolyn, Papa George, and all my 
great-grandparents.’

The last photo of Avery, he wrote, was
 taken 15-20 minutes before she stopped breathing. He said Avery was 
‘sitting on mommy’s lap looking at me and all it took to get her to 
smile this big was for me to keep saying “Hi.”’

Mike and Laura Canahuati received the heart-wrenching news only weeks ago that their daughter Avery had less than 18 months to live.

Avery’s blog has become something of 
an internet sensation – the website alone has garnered more than half a 
million page views, and her Facebook page has more than 12,000 ‘likes.’

Avery
 ‘wrote’ on her blog: ‘I have a lot of living to do in just a little bit
 of time and I’m going to need all of the help I can get from my parents
 and anyone else who wants to help.

‘Keep
 in mind in everything I do, the two most important things are that I’m 
spending time with my mommy & daddy, while at the same time 
spreading awareness for SMA.’

The initial bucket list included several childhood milestones, such as going swimming, going on a road trip, sit on daddy’s shoulders, have a birthday party, and stay up past my bedtime watching TV with mommy and daddy.

One of goals on the list was a little more salacious: Get a tattoo.

The cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world. Mrs Canahuati told Good Morning America that’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak.

The mother said: ‘When we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days, that’s when we realised we could really get the word out on SMA and spread the word as much as we could.’

The disease is the number one killer of U.S. children under two, she said, though the disease is largely unknown.

She urged possible parents to get tested for the genetic disease before conceiving. 

‘Our goal for Avery is to be the face of SMA,’ she said.
