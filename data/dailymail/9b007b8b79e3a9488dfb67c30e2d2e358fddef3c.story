This shocking photo shows the moment a police community support officer left her van illegally parked on double yellow lines - while she went shopping for tuna and sweetcorn.

The officer, who was dressed in full police uniform, stopped her van in the middle of the afternoon before strolling into a Co-operative supermarket in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, with another PCSO.

The driver allegedly parked just yards away from the store's customer car park - which had dozens of empty spaces.

Caught: The police van was parked on double yellow lines while two Police Community Support Officers popped into the nearby Co-operative supermarket for some food

The van was spotted by shopper Richard Smith, 28, who saw the illegally-parked van as he went to the nearby post office

The pair were spotted by outraged shopped Richard Smith, who took a photo of the incident on his phone.

The 28-year-old said the officers 'breezed through' the supermarket, laughing and joking with customers - before buying the tuna, sweetcorn and mints.

He said: 'When they parked on double yellow lines I couldn't believe it.

The two women officers were allegedly seen laughing and chatting with customers and flicking through magazines as they walked down the grocery aisle in the store in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire

One officer bought tuna and sweetcorn, while the other bought some mints. Mr Smith said the van was parked just yards away from a half-empty car park

'If there was an emergency then fair enough. But ten minutes later I saw them breezing through Co-op looking at the groceries.

'They were laughing and joking with other customers and they were definitely not in a rush.'

Mr Smith, who said he parked in the correct car 
park while he went to use the nearby post office, said he first saw the officers chatting in the vehicle for several 
minutes.

Ten minutes later, when he returned to his car, he saw the empty van and took several 
pictures.

He then popped to the supermarket for a lottery ticket - and saw the two officers walking down the grocery aisle, looking at magazines.

Mr Smith was so furious that he took photos of the two women while they paid for their items.

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said the PCSOs had been legitimately parked on the double yellows when they were making enquiries about a missing person

But the spokesman said the officers had 'briefly' gone to the shop afterwards - which was a 'lapse of judgement'

He said: 'Every other driver has to watch their backs for parking wardens and would never dream of parking on double yellows - especially when the car park was half empty.

'It's outrageous. These two either think they're above the law, or they don't know the rules of the road. It's one rule for them and another for the rest of us.

'I've been hit with fines before for stopping on double yellows, so they should be too.

'They're lucky that there aren't cameras there automatically fining cars that stop on double yellows.'

Police officers are only allowed to stop on double yellows if they are dealing with a motorist or attending an emergency.

But the Highway Code states that traffic laws apply to everyone, including police cars.

The cost of a PCN for stopping on double yellow lines is £70 or reduced to £35 if paid within two weeks.

A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: 'A police vehicle, being used by the local Safer Neighbourhood Team, was legitimately parked on double yellow lines while two Police Community Support Officers made enquiries in relation to a missing person.

'The vehicle was not causing any obstruction, however, after completing their enquiries the officers briefly attended a nearby shop to purchase some items before returning to the van.

'This was a momentary lapse of judgement for which the officers have received advice.'
