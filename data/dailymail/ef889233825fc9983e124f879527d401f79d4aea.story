For decades Berlin's Hohenschönhausen prison didn't officially exist.

The sprawling compound, run by the feared East German State Security known as the Stasi, was never noted on East German maps and the area was simply left a blank.

But most locals were left in little doubt of the horrors that what went on inside what they knew simply as Stasi Prison.

Haunting: A room inside the dreaded Hohenschönhausen prison where between 1951 and 1989, East German security known as the Stasi detained thousands of political prisoners

Eerie: Cooking pots lie rusting and abandoned inside a storage room at Hohenschönhausen where little has been changed since it was shut following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989

Between 1951 and 1989, thousands of political prisoners, including many notable figures who opposed the GDR government and its policies, were detained at Hohenschönhausen where they were subjected to extreme interrogation techniques.

The goal of Hohenschönhausen Prison staff was to destabilize prisoners in order to generate a feeling of total powerlessness. Prisoners were never informed as to where they were being held and were essentially completely sealed off from the outside world.

To incapacitate them more, they were also kept in strict isolation from their fellow prisoners. The effect of such conditions was to break down the prisoners so that they felt totally at the mercy of an almighty state authority. Interrogations were particularly cruel at the prison.

Control room: For many years the prison did not officially exist and was never noted on East German maps. The area was simply left blank

Detainees were often subjected to months of torture in which 
highly trained interrogators employed extreme methods which often 
included torture, to extract incriminating information

Following the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 many of those Berliners who were caught attempting to escape into West Germany were incarcerated at Hohenschönhausen.

In the autumn of 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and with it came the dismantling of the Stasi and its prisons. On October 3, 1990, when the German Democratic Republic was incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hohenschönhausen Prison was finally closed.

Photographer Philipp Lohöfener told Wired Magazine: 'I went home with more than the images.

'When you walk through these cells and rooms, it is not only the visual experience that is scary; it’s the smell, and how your footsteps sound, too.

'You get an uncomfortable feeling. I wanted to put over this discomfort in my images.'
