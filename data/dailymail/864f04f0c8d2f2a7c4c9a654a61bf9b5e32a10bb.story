Southampton want to sign Manchester City winger Scott Sinclair for £3million. 

The 25-year-old has endured a frustrating stint at the Etihad since his £6.2m move from Swansea, with limited appearances under former boss Roberto Mancini and an unsuccessful loan stint at West Brom.

Out of sorts: Scott Sinclair made six Premier League appearances during his loan spell at West Brom before returning to his parent club

Despite uncertainty over the future of boss Mauricio Pochettino, the Saints are tracking Sinclair in a bid to revive his ailing career.

City are keen to shed their playing squad to comply with FIFA's Financial Fair Play Regulations.
