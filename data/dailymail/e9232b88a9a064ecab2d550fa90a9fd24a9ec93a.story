The police officer seen on video punching a woman at a Philadelphia street party has been suspended for 30 days beginning Thursday with the intent to dismiss.

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey took what police call 'commissioner's direct action' on Wednesday in the case of Highway 
Patrol Lt Jonathan D. Josey II, 40, following Sunday's events during a festival associated with the city's Puerto Rican Day parade.

Ramsey described the incident, captured in the YouTube video, as very troubling and he thought the use of force applied was in excess of what was needed.

Fired? Highway Patrol Lt Jonathan D. Josey II was suspended following the incident last year

He said that while he knows and respects Josey for his accomplishments in the department, and he personally likes him, that would not impact his decision.

The president of the Philadelphia 
Fraternal Order of Police said Josey is eager to tell his side of the 
story to internal investigators.

The District Attorney's Office has 
also announced that charges against the victim of the incident, 
39-year-old Aida Guzman, have been dropped.

'We are happy that the charges are 
dropped and we support the decision if they are going to fire him or 
have fired him, we support that decision,' said her attorney Enrique 
Latoison.

'I feel so happy. I have a lot of 
pain in my body, but I feel so happy. I want to say thank you everybody for the support,' said Guzam.

She has suffered a swollen and cut lip as well s injuries to her hands and arm after the violent assault.

Speaking
 at her Chester home on Monday, she said she was angry at the officer's 
actions and insists she had done nothing wrong and that she was merely a
 participant in the parade.

Translating for her mother, her 
daughter Keysha, 19, said her mom was hit from behind and while she was 
on the ground the officer said: 'That's what you get'. She then told 
him,'It wasn't me.'

She said: 'That's what happened. I didn't do it. He has no right to put his hands on me. I'm 39, I don't play games like that.

'I feel angry, very angry. I go to someplace, got a good time and look this happen, for no reason.'

Lt Josey - is seen in the video punching Ms Guzman violently in the back of the head after someone else in the crowd throws silly string or water at the officers.

In March 2010, Josey was cleared in the fatal shooting of an armed robber at a 7-Eleven and was later cited for bravery.

He was stabbed in June 2010 when he was trying to break up a fight at a bar when he was off duty.

An internal affairs investigation was 
launched on Monday and Josey was placed on desk duty pending the outcome
 of the investigation.

Victim: Aida Guzman said she did nothing to provoke the incident. She is reported to be considering filing a civil lawsuit against Lt Josey

Aftermath: she points to the cuts and bruises on her arms and elbow following the attack

Injuries: Ms Guzman showed off her cut and swollen lip as well as grazes to her hands and arm

Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross said of the incident: 'We'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge that the video is disturbing.

'Clearly, the one issue at hand is she does appear to be walking away. She does not appear to be facing Lt Josey at that time.'

The 36-second video, which was first 
posted on YouTube on Sunday - the same day as the parade - has been 
watched by hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have voiced outrage at 
what is largely deemed unnecessary violence and brutality.

The
 video shows a number of people milling around during a street party that followed the parade.

A number of officers appear to be surrounding a
 car and as their backs are turned, someone throws an unidentified 
substance at them which some viewers speculated was either water or 
silly string.

When Lt 
Josey turns around, he zeroes in on Ms Guzman and as she nonchalantly 
walks away from the impending danger, he punches her from behind and 
knocks her to the floor.

The
 39-year-old was then arrested and was issued a summary citation for 
disorderly conduct, on which police reported she had thrown beer at 
them.

Violence: Ms Guzman was floored during the incident and can be seen being cuffed as she looks up bewildered

Injuries: Ms Guzman is led away from the scene, bloodied, by a policeman. The footage caused outrage when it was posted online

Friends
 told the Daily News that these were not actions typical of Josey, calling him a stand-up citizen, loving father and caring member of 
the community.

They also revealed that bout three years ago, he and Crime Scene Unit
 Officer Terry Lewis started the Life or Death Initiative, a nonprofit 
organization that teaches violence prevention to teens and ex-offenders.

The
 Fraternal Order of Police said it will 'defend Josey to the end', with 
President John McNesby saying the officers did not know what was being 
thrown at them as they have been attacked by urine and bleach in the 
past.

The executive 
director of Concilio, the organization responsible for putting on the 
parade every year, called on police to fully investigate: 'While we have
 no knowledge of what led to the incident, it is clear from the video 
that a police officer unnecessarily and brutally struck a woman in the 
face.

'One of the 
reasons for Concilio’s founding 50 years ago was to combat police 
brutality such as the assault shown in this video.

'Even
 as we celebrate the tremendous advancements of Philadelphia’s Hispanic 
community over the decades, we cannot overlook this episode. 

'We call on the Philadelphia Police Department to fully investigate and take appropriate action.'

Around 1,500 people attended the parade on Sunday.
