A Democratic congressional candidate in Arizona has changed his name to Cesar Chavez in an effort to elicit support from his largely Hispanic district.

Chavez, whose birth name was Scott Fistler, has previously run in two other political campaigns in Arizona- both times as a Republican- but lost each time.

So he took a different tact and the Arizona Capitol Times reports that he petitioned the state superior court to change his name to the same one as the famed civil rights activist this past November.

Bending to the audience: Scott Fistler (pictured) changed his name in November to Cesar Chavez and has since changed his political alliance from Republican to Democratic as he runs for congressional office

In the official paperwork, 34-year-old Fistler wrote that he 'experienced many hardships because of my name'.

Namesake: In his application, Fistler said that he 'experienced hardships because of his name' and did not mention the famed labor leader (pictured)

After paying the required $319 fee, the name change was approved but that was the only form of reinvention that he launched ahead of his latest campaign.

Fistler ran as a Republican write in candidate against Congressman Ed Pastor in 2012 and as a Republican city council candidate in Phoenix in 2013.

But in February of this year, the newly-renamed Chavez filed his campaign registration as a Democrat in his attempt to replace 70-year-old Democratic Representative Pastor, who announced that he will not be seeking re-election this year.

'People want a name that they can feel comfortable with,' Chavez explained to the Arizona Republic.

'If you went out there running for office and your name was Bernie Madoff, you'd probably be screwed.

'It's almost as simple as saying Elvis Presley is running for president... You wouldn't forget it, would you?'

Chavez's own personal history- as an unemployed military veteran with a Chihuahua named King- bears little resemblance to his namesake, who started as a farm worker and later became one of the most recognizable labor leaders in the country.

He told the Arizona Republic that he views the two Hispanic candidates as his top competition in the race but feels that he has the edge, publicity wise, due to his name: so much so, that he has even stopped taking press requests for the time being.

False advertising: The newly-named Chavez's website has pictures of crowds of Venezuelan supporters of Hugo Chavez on the background

'There is just simply not enough Cesar Chavez to go around,' he told The Arizona Capitol Times.

When that day comes, questions have to be screened and can only be five words long.

His online campaign presence is not even his own, as the congressional campaign's website uses photos of hoards of Chavez supporters at an undated rally, but those individuals were showing their allegiance to Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and not the candidate in Arizona.
