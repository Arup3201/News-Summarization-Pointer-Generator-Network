A collection of First World War Christmas cards showing how a company known for its 'saucy' seaside designs turned its hand to rallying wartime spirit have been unveiled 100 years after they first hit the printing press.

Postcard company Bamforth & Co, which was best known for its seaside characters, has shared part of their vast archive of thousands of unique designs, including cards marking Christmas during the First World War, in two new books.

The festive prints feature First World War propaganda, messages wishing the troops on the Western Front good luck and thank you, as well as war inspired humour - such as a soldier battling a ‘tank’ in his bathroom, and the German Kaiser, William II, getting hit with a Christmas pudding.

Like many other forms of postcard propaganda during this period, the Bamforth series of First World War cards included more than 80 cards dedicated to lampooning ‘Kaiser Bill’.

The images are featured in two new books published by Ravette, including Till We Meet Again, which focusses on messages sent to loved ones, and their replies.

Wilhelm, who was the grandson of Queen Victoria, born in 1859 to Prince Frederick William of Prussia (the future Frederick III) and his wife, Victoria, Princess Royal, the British monarch's eldest daughter

The cards also promote the strength of Britain and are designed to give both the troops abroad and those back at home a much-needed boost

The cards feature humourous scenes, such as a soldier battling a ‘tank’ in his bathroom, and this image of a family with a monkey puppet

One of the books, ‘Till We Meet Again’ contains a selection of poignant images and messages relating to the soldiers sending messages back to loved ones and the heartfelt replies they would receive

Bamforth & Co Ltd, was started in 1870 by portrait photographer James Bamforth in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, with these two wartime cards showing the saucy seaside humour the company is best known for

This humourous card implored the receiver to look at the brighter side of life with the new year ahead

In 2010, on the 100th anniversary of the original launch of the seaside postcards, current owner Ian Wallace relaunched the publication and sale of Bamford's postcards following his purchase of more than 50,000 designs from the Dennis Printing Company back in 2001
