David Beckham's team have unveiled plans for a new waterfront stadium in downtown Miami.

The venue will be home to Miami Beckham United and house 20,000 fans after their original plan for a facility at nearby PortMiami was ruled out by Dade County officials following resistance from local businesses.

The plan centres around a £12million project to fill in a deep-water boat slip next to the home of NBA side the Miami Heat.

If the move goes ahead, Museum Park would be increased by 4.3 acres while the new site takes in a small piece of public-owned land known as Parcel B.

Beckham said in a statement: 'By expanding Museum Park with new public spaces anchored by world-class art and science museums and a world-class soccer club, we’ll be activating the waterfront on a year-round basis.'

Marcelo Claure added: 'Our plans to transform the FEC slip and Parcel B into soccer grounds and a public park will give Miami fans a chance to experience the thrill of the sport right in the heart of downtown.'

Beckham's MLS franchise is due to start playing in 2016 or 2017.
