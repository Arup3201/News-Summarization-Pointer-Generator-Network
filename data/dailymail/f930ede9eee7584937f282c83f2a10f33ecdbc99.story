A firefighter has been hailed a hero after helping to save the life of a passenger who was choking and had stopped breathing on board a flight to the UK from Australia.

Neil Punt, from Mark, Somerset, was returning from a holiday, flying between Singapore and Abu Dhabi with his family, when a fellow passenger became unwell at 30,000ft.

The 44-year-old, based at Weston-super-Mare fire station, said he stepped in and used the skills he had learned on the job to help resuscitate the woman.

He said: 'It was a night flight and most of the passengers were asleep.

'I became aware of a bit of a commotion a few rows in front of me and went to see if I could help.

'A lady had stopped breathing and had no pulse. Using the first aid skills I have as a firefighter, I applied three back slaps.'

When this technique failed to work, Mr Punt said he performed the Heimlich manoeuvre - a series of abdominal thrusts designed to dislodge foreign bodies from the airways. At this point, the female passenger vomited and regained a pulse.

The pilot then put out a call to ask if there were any doctors or other medically trained passengers on board.

'When no one came forward I continued to assess and monitor the lady's condition,' Mr Punt said.

'She was in and out of consciousness for the rest of the flight to Abu Dhabi and there was talk of diverting the flight.

'We eventually made it to our destination and the lady was taken away by the medical team who were waiting for her on our arrival.'

Etihad Airways thanked Mr Punt for his 'timely and unconditional help' in aiding a passenger who was unwell

Mr Punt had recently completed what is known as  First Person On Scene training, as part of his job as a firefighter.

This type of training is given to emergency services workers, such as police officers and community first responders, to provide them with skills and knowledge to enable them to carry out immediate care in the first moments of an emergency.

'Having to deal with this incident certainly highlighted the importance of the training,' he said.

Three weeks after the event, which occurred on August 8, Neil received a letter from Etihad Airways thanking him for his assistance.

In the letter, Guest Affairs Officer for Etihad Airways, Faiza Abdul Rahim, wrote: 'On behalf of Etihad Airways I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the assistance you rendered to one of our guests who required medical attention.

'The medical aid you gave may have helped to avoid what could have been a potentially unpleasant situation for the guest and we gratefully acknowledge your timely and unconditional help.'
