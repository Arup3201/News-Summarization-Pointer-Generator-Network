Despite the squeeze on household budgets you can enjoy a tasty Christmas if you buy your Stilton from Morrisons, according to the Good Housekeeping Institute

Luxury need not be off the menu this Christmas, for budget stilton and Christmas puddings are better than anything from Harrods, Fortnums and Heston.

A Morrisons Signature Stilton came top in a blind taste test by food experts, while a rival offering from Harrods placed 13th and Fortnum & Mason was 14th.

At the same time Aldi, the budget chain which has become a darling of the Middle Classes, has taken the crown for supplying the best Christmas puds.

Its £3.89 Connoisseur Christmas 
Pudding came top of the taste league, while its Specially Selected 
Luxury Champagne Christmas Pudding was runner up.

Both beat offerings from Harrods and Fortnums, while they were also ahead of Heston’s Hidden Chocolate pudding sold by Waitrose.

Experts at the Good Housekeeping 
Institute carried out blind taste tests on 165 festive foods across 13 
categories, including turkey and all the trimmings to mince pies and 
mulled wine.

The evidence is that, despite the cost
 of living squeeze, people can still enjoy some of the highest quality 
food on Christmas Day without busting the budget.

Marks & Spencer came out as the 
best overall store for Christmas food by scoring eight top five 
positions across the 13 categories.

It had two category wins with it 
Brandy Butter with Remy Martin and Salted Caramel Chocolate Forest Cake,
 which was the best alternative festive cake.

There were also commendations for its 
Free Range Pembrokeshire Bronze Turkey,  Suffolk Ale Cured Ham, Sugar 
Plum Christmas Pudding and mulled wine.

Loch Fyne Bradan Orach Traditional Smoked Salmon was voted best in its category while Morrisons took the prize for the best turkey

However, it is the appeal of budget 
products which was particularly startling, according to the Institute’s 
Consumer Director, Caroline Bloor.

As well as selling the best stilton, 
Morrisons won the turkey category with its bargain buy free-range frozen
 bird, which was just £18 for a small bird. Its Fruit and Cognac 
Stuffing Balls also came out top in its category.

Morrisons Signature Brandy Butter with Remy Martin, Winter Warmer mulled wine and Ronnie Reindeer cake also did well.

The Aldi triumphs included a runner up
 place for both its Specially Selected Pure Breed Roly Poly Fresh 
British Turkey and its Pork and Chestnut Stuffing Balls.

There were some crumbs of comfort for 
Heston Blumenthal, who claimed the prize of offering the best mince pies
 with the Heston from Waitrose Spiced Shortcrust Mince Pies.

Mince pies: The votes are in and Heston's pies for Waitrose won the taste test with Thomas the Baker's variation coming in second place

Aldi's Connoisseur Christmas Pudding came first, while their specially Selected Luxury Champagne Christmas Pudding came second

The store also won plaudits for its 
Kelly Dry Aged Free Range Bronze Feathered Fresh Turkey;  Venison, Pork,
 Cranberry & Orange Sausage Meat Stuffing Wraps; and Cherry and 
Almond Glitter Topped Christmas Pudding, Sainsbury’s came out top in the
 traditional Christmas cake category with its Taste the Difference Stag 
Iced Rich Fruit Cake, while Tesco was number one for its Premium Mulled 
wine.

On Saturday, the Daily Mail 
highlighted the £20,000 Christmas hamper from Harrods, stuffed with the 
finest champagne, cold meats, caviar and foie gras.

The blind taste tests put its Orange 
and Cranberry Ham at the top of its category, while its Mild Cured 
Smoked Salmon and iced Christmas cake were commended.

Best champagne went to the 
distinctively upmarket Louis Roederer Brut Premier NV, which is around 
£37 a bottle, while Loch Fyne Bradan Orach Traditional Smoked Salmon won
 its category.

Miss Bloor said: ‘Shopping for 
Christmas dinner – one of the most eagerly anticipated meals of the year
 – can be very stressful. Deciding what to choose when faced with 
products you may only buy once a year can be hit and miss.

‘Our annual Good Housekeeping Tried 
and Tested special on festive foods proves you don’t need to bust the 
budget buying expensive names to treat everyone to something special. In
 most categories, the overall winner is from a high street supermarket.

‘If you’re going to splash out, save your money for the champagne and smoked salmon.
