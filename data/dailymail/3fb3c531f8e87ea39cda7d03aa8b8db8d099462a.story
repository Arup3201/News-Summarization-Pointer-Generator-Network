As Louis van Gaal's Manchester United reign began with a dispiriting 2-1 home defeat by Swansea City, the disintegration of his team may have taken him by surprise. 

While United's players have produced vibrant and intense performances in pre-season, this was a return to the sluggish, timid and disappointing performances of last season. 

Van Gaal has spent the last month training him players intensively in the 3-5-2 formation but that system was shelved after just 45 minutes amid a spate of injuries and an unconvincing first half showing. 

Here, Sportsmail analyses why Van Gaal's favoured philosophy came up short and how the Dutchman can correct United's ills...

Failed: Louis van Gaal tinkered with many systems but couldn't turn United's fortunes around

Why didn't the 3-5-2 work?

Louis van Gaal will be reluctant to use injuries as an excuse but clearly United were handicapped by several of their most important players being out injured. Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick and Robin van Persie would all have walked into the starting line-up and offered a more formidable threat.

Throughout the team, United players looked uncomfortable, short of purpose and it resulted in a sluggish and flat performance. Holes emerged everywhere. 

Phil Jones appeared uneasy as part of the defensive three while Darren Fletcher and Ander Herrera failed to provide a shield to the defence, leaving their team-mates brutally exposed for Swansea's opening goal.  Nothing, however, should be taken away from Swansea, who made 28 passes in the lead up to Ki's superbly taken strike.

Perhaps the biggest concern for Van Gaal will have been the anonymity of Juan Mata. If this system is partially devised to liberate the Spaniard in his favoured central position, then Van Gaal needs Mata to shine.

Wayne Rooney was similarly ineffective in in the first-half, while Javier Hernandez was substituted at half-time. In truth, though, the Mexican is a penalty-box forward and relies on service from his team-mates. He was the one picked out by Van Gaal but Hernandez was let down by those behind him.

Do United have the players to play 3-5-2?

The evidence of pre-season suggests so but on Saturday lunchtime, it was dysfunctional and there were too many square pegs in round holes. Jesse Lingard was caught out a couple of times at right wing-back before succumbing to injury early on. Adnan Januzaj replaced him in that position and he, frankly, is far too good going forward to have to worry about defensive concerns.

Van Gaal's preference to play three at the back is sadly undermined by the glaring truth that only Jonny Evans has proved himself as a defender of Manchester United quality in recent years. The jury is out on Phil Jones and Chris Smalling while Tyler Blackett, the most impressive United defender against Swansea, has only one Premier League appearance to his name. 

Evidently, Van Gaal needs his chief executive Ed Woodward to close some deals. Marcos Rojo of Sporting is believed to be close but United now have only two weeks to act. They knew Nemanja Vidic was leaving at the turn of the year and it was expected that Rio Ferdinand would follow - how have they left it so late?

No cover: It was unfair to expect Tyler Blackett to solve problems on his United debut

United also appear short in central midfield. Ander Herrera is stylish and composed and Darren Fletcher is steady but Van Gaal needs some bite in there and somebody that can grab a football match by the scruff of its neck. United continue to deny links to Juventus' Arturo Vidal but he would be an ideal signing after missing out on Cesc Fabregas and Toni Kroos.

Paul Scholes said on BT Sport: 'The big thing for me was the quality just wasn’t there in the midfield.

'[Wayne] Rooney and [Juan] Mata couldn't feed off anything.

'The big thing about Louis van Gaal spending big money now is – who comes in? Is the quality there? The two big players haven’t come – Toni Kross and Cesc Fabregas.'

What changed in the second half?

United changed to what Van Gaal described as a 4-3-3 but to the layman appeared to be a 4-4-1-1: De Gea; Jones, Smalling, Blackett, Young; Januzaj, Herrera, Fletcher, Nani; Mata, Rooney. For 20 minutes, the plan appeared to be working as Rooney equalised. Briefly, United threatened to build up a head of steam but the momentum was killed by Swansea's second goal.

In previous years, when United equalise at Old Trafford, you expect the whole tone of the game to shift and the Alamo to be launched towards the opponent's goal, as United attack with dynamism, pace and fury. A Rooney free-kick aside, United barely threatened.

Even in six minutes of added time - Mike Dean had only signalled for four (some things stay the same at Old Trafford) - United did not create a chance of note. In a striking similarity to last season, United were ponderous, hesitant and seemed to lack the belief to go for the throat of the opponents.

Again, players looked uneasy in their roles, and Ashley Young's misjudgement for the second goal was typical of an attacking winger being asked to play as a full-back.

Ultimately, systems, formations or philosophies can become meaningless if the personnel is not up to scratch or the players are bereft of confidence.

Impressive: Adnan Januzaj could be the flying winger United fans have come to expect at Old Trafford

Should Manchester United be ditching the wingers?

Evidently, Nani, Ashley Young and Shinji Kagawa have not demonstrated enough in recent times to warrant a place on the wing in a 4-4-2. You can understand, therefore, why Van Gaal has experimented with the 3-5-2.

However, we should not forget that these United supporters have been groomed on the Sir Alex Ferguson philosophy that centred around flying wingers - Kanchelskis, Giggs, Beckham, Ronaldo. 

In Adnan Januzaj, United appear to have another and he is, without question, the most exciting player on United's books. In the long-term, United view him as a number 10 but his willingness to commit opponents and produce quality makes him United's stand-out wide player. 

If United were able to recruit another winger - Angel di Maria has been monitored this summer, while Marco Reus was a target earlier this year - Van Gaal would then have the personnel to revert to a style of play that United fans adore.

If that signing is not forthcoming, United followers may have to be patient with this new philosophy - but five shots on target in a game at Old Trafford falls below the call of duty.

On the lookout: Van Gaal must strengthen the squad... but fans also have to be patient with his philosophy
