Guilty: Jason Cotterill, outside court today, used more than 60 different Facebook profiles to send 'disgusting' messages to his ex-girlfriend, her family and her friends after she ended their relationship

A 42-year-old man sent an explicit photo of his former lover to her daughter as part of a campaign of harassment after she ended their relationship.

Jason Cotterill  used more than 60 different Facebook profiles to send 'disgusting' messages and 'revenge porn' to his ex-girlfriend, her family and her friends after she blocked him on the social networking site.

He also threatened to share pornographic video content of the woman  after he found it online. 

Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, was found guilty of harassment at Birmingham Magistrates' Court today.

Cotterill and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013, Birmingham Magistrates' Court was told. 

They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion.

Shortly afterwards the woman ended the relationship, but Cotterill refused to accept her decision. 

During the trial the woman said having sex with Cotterill had been a 'mistake'. 

She told the court he set up more than 60 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked and 'unfriended' him on the social networking site. 

She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me.

'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication.

'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' 

The victim, who used to be a sex worker, said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said.

In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. 

He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.'

He also sent a message which said: 'Why don't you play no more? Might send the photo to your sis.'

Prosecutor Rukhsana Mohammed told Cotterill: 'You felt anger because you wanted to maintain the relationship and she didn't want it.

'After she cut you off by changing her number you created fake Facebook profiles about 60 times to get through to her.

'You wanted to embarrass her so searched the Internet for material, the video was found by you.'

'Honourable': Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, said he sent the woman the explicit video because he wanted to 'warn her'. He was found guilty of harassment at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, pictured, today

Giving evidence today, Cotterill admitted sending the woman the video, but claimed it was because he wanted to 'warn her' it was on the internet.

He said: 'I sent her it because she was an old friend and I wanted to warn her.'

Mr Houldcroft, defending, said: 'Mr Cotterill had good and honourable intentions, he wanted to warn the complainant.' 

District Judge David Robinson dismissed the claim saying: 'I believe she was harassed in October and November last year. 

'If the defendant was acting out of good will I would find it extraordinary and if he used his account a lot then how was he not aware of other messages sent from it.' 

Cotterill was bailed and ordered to return to court for sentencing on March 6.   

Luke King was jailed for posting an explicit image

Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws.

It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. 

It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. 

Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught.

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. 

Last year, Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three-year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images.

King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.
