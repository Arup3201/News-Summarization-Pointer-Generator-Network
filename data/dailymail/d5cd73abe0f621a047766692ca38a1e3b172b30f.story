Itâ€™s the most dangerous motorsport endurance race in the world, and has already claimed the lives of three victims.

The Dakar Rally is a 5,500-mile race over mountains and across deserts, often in stifling temperatures. 

But amid the gruelling contest held in the heat of the desert a photographer has documented rare moments of calm and beauty as the race ground to a halt for a rest day.

The marathon motor rally was originally staged between Paris and Dakar in Senegal, but was moved to South America - Argentina and Chile - in 2009 because of threats of terrorism.

Three deaths overshadowed Friday's sixth leg of the Dakar Rally, as the race claimed the life of Belgian motorcyclist Eric Palante and two spectators who were following the event. 

Palante's body was found after he failed to finish Thursday's fifth stage.

Nani Roma of Spain has kept the overall lead in cars despite finishing sixth in the stage, and fellow Spaniard Marc Coma stayed on top in bikes after taking second on the stage from Tucuman to Salta in northern Argentina.

Roma, driving a Mini, has a large lead of 30 minutes, 30 seconds over Orlando Terranova of Argentina, and 40:54 ahead of 11-time winner Stephane Peterhansel.

Organisers said they went out looking for the 50-year-old Palante after he failed to finish the fifth stage, which most riders completed on Thursday, and found his body along the route.

The cause of death was being investigated, and officials offered few details.

This was Palante's 11th Dakar Rally, according to an event biography, which said he would have turned 51 on Jan. 21. It said his goal was to win the amateur trophy for motorbikes.

'He knew the race very well, and over the years his enthusiastic but serious approach had made him one of the pillars of the event,' organizers said in a statement.

Organisers said they received no alert from Palante.

Police said two people following the race died on Thursday when their vehicle overturned in rough terrain in northern Argentina.

Police identified the pair on Friday as Agustin Ignacio Mina, 19, and Daniel Eduardo Ambrosio, 51. Officials said Mina was covering the rally for a motor racing magazine, and they identified Ambrosio as a fan of motor sports.

The Dakar, raced over rugged terrain in difficult-to-control areas, often produces fatalities. Last year, French motorcyclist Thomas Bourgin was killed in a collision with a Chilean police car. Two fans also died in a collision between a support vehicle and two taxis.

The Dakar began on Sunday January 5,  in Rosario, Argentina, and ends January 18, in Valapariso, Chile. This is the sixth straight year it has been held in South America.
