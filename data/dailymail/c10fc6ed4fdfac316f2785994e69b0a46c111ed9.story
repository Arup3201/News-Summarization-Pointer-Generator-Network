Manu Tuilagi faces a battle to be fit for England’s opening autumn international against the All Blacks after the Leicester centre suffered another groin injury in Saturday's victory over Ulster.

He went off after 15 minutes suffering a recurrence of the problem that ruled him out earlier in the season.

Director of rugby Richard Cockerill does not expect Tuilagi to be fit for next weekend’s trip to the Scarlets, leaving the 23-year-old a maximum of one match to prove his fitness for the international series which starts on November 8.

‘Hopefully it’s not too much of an issue, but it’s not right and that’s a concern for everybody,’ said Cockerill. ‘I can’t comment [on how long he’s going to be out] but you’d imagine it’s not going to be a one-weeker.’

The blow did not stop Leicester silencing their critics in their Champions Cup opener — despite Paddy Jackson kicking the visitors to an early 3-0 lead. Owen Williams filled the void left by Tuilagi and he crashed over for the opening try. Freddie Burns added the extras.

Paul Marshall, in for injured Ruan Pienaar, was caught out when Ben Youngs intercepted his pass. The Tigers skipper broke clear and found Graham Kitchener, who slid over for the second try.

Ulster were then down to 14 after Craig Gilroy was sin-binned for an aerial tackle on Miles Benjamin. The hosts capitalised as Burns broke through to extend the lead. Williams converted.

Williams and Jackson exchanged further penalties early in the second half, before Ulster closed the gap with a Tommy Bowe try. Paddy Jackson added the conversion.

The visitors set up a gripping finale when Franco van der Merwe dived over for a losing bonus point.
