Congressional staffers and Capitol employees walked out of the office and stood on the steps of the House to protest the killing of unarmed black men by police.

About 200 workers and a few members of Congress gathered on Thursday and silently raised their arms in the 'don't shoot' gesture used to protest the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

They stood, heads bowed, as Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black prayed, 'Forgive us when we have failed to lift our voices for those who couldn't speak or breathe for themselves.'  

'Hands up': Congressional staff members gather on Capitol Hill in Washington to raise awareness of the recent killings of black men by police officers, both of which did not result in grand jury indictments

Walkout: Around 200 employees and some members of the House gathered for the demonstration 

Demonstration: The walkout came as both houses of Congress attempt to pass a spending measure and avert government shutdown

He emphasized 'breathe' in a reference to Eric Garner of New York, who died after a police chokehold.

Afterward, Black said the workers were exercising their free speech rights to seek a larger conversation about the issue, which has sparked demonstrations across the country. 

Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat for Maryland said in a statement: 'Democrats and Republicans across the country are incredibly frustrated by what happened in Ferguson, Staten Island, and elsewhere, and this protest reflects the mistrust they have in the integrity of the criminal justice system.

'These congressional staffers put in incredibly long hours, nights, and weekends working to pass legislation to help people live better lives, so I fully support them taking a few moments today to pray with the Senate chaplain for Congress to take action to ensure that all Americans are treated equally before the law.'

Cummings is one of several members of Congress who requested hearings on the issues raised by Garner's and Brown's deaths.

One staffer who planned the event told CNN: 'We're proud to have this moment of solidarity with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and the thousands of peaceful protesters around the country who are telling this country that black lives matter.

'I believe it's important, because what affects one community really affects the entire country.

Standing together: One staffer who organized the event said: 'We're proud ton have this moment of solidarity with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner'

'Mistrust': Elijah Cummings, Democratic Congressman for Maryland joined those during the walkout on the Hill saying that politicians from both parties are 'incredibly frustrated' with what has happened

'Don't shoot': They walked out following the death of a number of victims at the hands of police including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and  Eric Garner in New York 

Unity: Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black, who led a prayer for those involved, said the employees were exercising their free speech  

In interviews conducted by Associated Press reporters across the nation, which were released on Thursday retired and active black officers expressed concern about how black men are treated by the largely white police forces in the United States, an issue that has led to protests alleging police brutality.

The officers say they want change just as much as anyone else, and advocate for it where they can because they, too, have something to lose. 

'A lot of us have sons, and we want to make sure our colleagues are treating our young boys with dignity and respect,' said Oakland Police Lt. LeRonne Armstrong, a 16-year veteran.

Since the summertime deaths of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, who gasped 'I can't breathe' while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in New York, thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest their deaths, the grand juries' decisions — and the nation's police forces.
