Police will take no action over a dog bite which left a toddler needing her lip stitched back on - because the pet was on a lead.

Lily-May Brindley, aged 22 months, spent a night in hospital after she was bitten while feeding the ducks with her grandmother in a park in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

Lily-May's father insisted the three-year-old rescue dog should be put down - but police will take no action, saying no crime was committed, after the dog's owner insisted she was just defending herself.

Her father added: 'The whole incident has been upsetting. Lily-May didn’t eat for two days and is on medication'

The girl's parents Jack Brindley and Sarah Wainwright, both 20, said she almost ended losing her bottom lip in the attack on Thursday last week and had emergency surgery to sew it 
back on.

Mr Brindley said: 'I want the dog put down for what it did. My daughter’s lip was 
hanging off but the police have tried to tell me that because the dog 
was on a lead it was under control.

'The fact that it attacked my daughter shows it clearly was not under control at all.

'Lily-May
 has been left shaken and traumatised by the attack. She can’t sleep at 
night and I think she is having nightmares about it because she keeps 
crying out in her sleep.

'The whole incident has been very upsetting. Lily-May didn’t eat for two days and she is on medication now.'

Her mother added: 'I was devastated when I saw 
what had happened. I couldn’t look at her it was so horrible.

Not her fault: Three-year-old rescue dog Pepper, whose owner Reg Cox, 69, said he would not put her down

Faithful: Police said Mr Cox (pictured) had committed no crime because he was walking Pepper on a lead

Mr Cox said: 'I've had Pepper since she was a puppy and I love her. She's never attacked anyone before'

'The
 attack was so bad Lily-May almost lost her lip - it was just hanging 
off. She now has a massive scab and I am so worried she is going to be 
left with a scar.

'The owner apologised at the hospital and told us he would get the dog put down, but now he has changed his mind.

'I want to police to step in and do the right thing - but they say they can’t do anything because the dog was on a lead.'

But the owner of the dog, a 
three-year-old female rescue pet called Pepper, said she was simply 
acting on instinct - and police agreed, saying no crime was committed.

Recovering: Lily-May had emergency surgery

Retired engineer Reg Cox, 69, took Pepper in as a puppy and said: 'It wasn't Pepper's fault. She was defending herself against the child who had bread in her hand.

'Pepper
 thought the girl was provoking her and acted out of instinct. It was 
the little girl's fault really. I've heard she's fine anyway.

'The
 parents want to sue me but I'm not having it. I've had Pepper since she
 was a puppy and I love her. I always keep her on a lead and she's never
 attacked anyone before.

'It's not her fault. If you let children carry bread about in a park where dogs are walked what do you expect?'

A
 Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'A one-year-old girl had been 
bitten on the lip by a Jack Russell dog and this had happened at the 
park at Smithpool Road, Fenton.

'Patrols
 attended and spoke to all parties concerned, the parents, the little 
girl’s nan, who was with her at the time, and the dog owner.

'The
 girl’s father was inquiring with the view to press charges, but then 
changed his mind. The dog’s owner said he was going to have the dog put 
down.

'Ultimately there was insufficient evidence to support an offence of having a dog out of control in a public place.

'The
 dog was under control, on a lead. What appears to have happened is the 
child stood close to the dog while holding a bag containing bread and 
the dog has bitten her on the mouth.

'We believe the dog was acting on natural instinct and accidentally came into contact with the child’s mouth.'

Lily-May's father said: 'The fact that it attacked my daughter shows it clearly was not under control at all'
