Princess Beatrice was spotted stepping out for a stroll with her long-term boyfriend, Dave Clark, in St Barts.

The couple, who have been dating for more than six years, looked relaxed as they walked along the waterfront of the Caribbean island, where they have been enjoying some winter sun. 

The sighting comes after it emerged that Beatrice's father, Prince Andrew, will fly back from his skiing holiday in Verbier today to tell the Queen that he did not have sex with underage girls.

Stylish: The royal, pictured with Mr Clark, added a splash of colour to her outfit with a vibrant bucket bag

Princess Beatrice, 26, looked slim and stylish in a simple white dress and matching panama hat. A blue bucket bag with a vibrant design added a bold splash of colour to the summery ensemble.

Mr Clark, a Virgin Galactic executive, looked just as casual in long shorts and trainers - paired with a relaxed blue-grey shirt. The 31-year-old also sported a fashionable pair of sunglasses.

Prince Andrew will today return for a summit with his mother amid allegations he used a 17-year-old 'sex slave' and had an orgy with girls while they were minors.

The Prince had been skiing last week in the Swiss resort of Verbier with his former wife Sarah Ferguson, daughter Princess Eugenie and her friend Cressida Bonas.

Princess Eugenie, 24, was photographed yesterday as she returned to the snow-covered chalet with a group of friends including Miss Bonas - Prince Harry's former flame.

It emerged today that the Prince may have immunity from prosecution for his alleged involvement in the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend, under a deal with the US government.

Holiday: The young royal was photographed earlier this week as she celebrated the new year with frineds

The secret plea agreement  struck  in 2007 protects Epstein, along with his 'co-conspirators', from a number of criminal charges relating to an alleged  sex trafficking ring set up for the rich and famous.

It is claimed that the 'non-prosecution' agreement was obtained by billionaire Epstein - a convicted sex offender - through his 'significant social and political connections'.

Last night, the Duke of York made a robust rebuttal of allegations made by Virginia Roberts that she was forced to have sex with the royal when she was only 17 - making her a minor in Florida.

Prince Andrew came out fighting against the woman, whose allegations have dogged him since a photograph of them together emerged in 2011.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said in a statement to The Mail on Sunday: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

'Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.' 

The denial was more emphatic than a previous one issued, which said that 'any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue'.

Earlier this week, Princess Beatrice was photographed sipping champagne on a yacht off the Caribbean island as she welcomed the new year with friends. 

She and Mr Clark are often spotted enjoying romantic evenings out at some of London's most exclusive dining venues - including celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse.
