The idyllic thatched roof cottage is a dream for many, and the designers of this eco-friendly house were no different - so made one out of seaweed

The remote forest home has a roof made entirely from water-based plants, which also coat several walls.

A thatched roof is normally made out of straw, rushes or heather, but when inland vegetation was nowhere to be found, the Danish team behind the eco-home turned to a nearby lake.

In the weeds: Over eight tons of eelgrass seaweed was harvested to cover the roof and walls of the house, located on a Danish island

The seaweed is harvested, washed and dried before it is packed into bales and used to build walls and cover the roof

This specific type of seaweed, called 
eelgrass, is harvested from the water with an excavator and left on the 
nearby marsh to be washed by rain.

Once washed, the seaweed is left to dry in the sunshine before being pressed into round bales, just like hay.

Soren Nielsen, a Copenhagen architect, designed the unique house that is located on the Laesoe island in Denmark.

'The objective 
was to demonstrate how a natural resource like seaweed can be integrated
in contemporary construction,' the 52-year-old said.

‘The idea was to re-introduce 
overlooked or disregarded organic materials to a modern industrialised 
technology at a time where low-carbon solutions are much called for.’

In order to build the roof on the 
eco-home, a staggering eight tons of seaweed had to be collected from 
the nearby water before it was prepared and stacked 3ft 3in high in 
order to keep the rain out.

The one-of-a-kind home took four months to construct and is now expected to fetch around £350,000.

The 
house has a flexible design which includes a central living room and 
dining combo, with open adjacent kitchen and steep stairs to two attic 
spaces.

At both ends of the 
central space, the 100 sqm property boasts two separate areas, one with a
toilet and wardrobe, the other with a larger bathroom.

The forest sanctuary also boasts two large terraces, with an outdoor bath and kitchen on the south-facing one.

Far from flatpack: The house took four months for the team to build and is expected to sell for £350,000
