David Cameron's family could have money tied up in offshore tax havens after it was revealed his father made a fortune through a network of offshore investment funds.

Ian Cameron, whose wealth was once estimated at £10m, ran several, perfectly legal, offshore accounts in tax havens such as Panama City and Geneva.

The Guardian newspaper reports that Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, left a fortune of £2.74m, from which the Prime Minister personally received a sum of £300,000.

However the will, which is a public document, only lists assets held in England or Wales.

Offshore investments would only have been listed in submissions made to HMRC for inheritance tax purposes and it remains unclear exactly what those assets are and which family member owns them.

The Prime Minister has been a harsh critic of companies that avoid paying their 'fair share' of tax and recently announced plans to introduce laws to clamp down on the practice.

Earlier this year he suggested he would be willing to disclose information about his own financial affairs.

In his budget speech last month Chancellor George Osborne described ‘tax evasion and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance as morally repugnant’.

Ian Cameron, who had worked as a city stockbroker, first began setting up investment funds in 1979 shortly after Margaret Thatcher abolished capital controls making it legal to take any sum of money out of the country without it being taxed.

He became chairman of Close International Asset management based in Jersey, senior director of Blairmore Holdings Inc registered in Panama and a shareholder in Blairmore Asset Management based in Geneva.

Blairmore Holdings, named after the Camerons' ancestral home in Aberdeenshire, was established in 1982 when the Prime Minister was a 16-year-old pupil at Eton.

In its investment prospectus for 2006 it states it is seeking 'sophisticated' investors worth at least $100,000 who wished to to legally avoid paying British tax.

It reads: 'The directors intend that 
the affairs on the fund should be managed and conducted so that it does 
not become resident in the United Kingdom for UK taxation purposes.

'The fund will not be subject to United Kingdom corporation tax or income tax on its profits.'

As a founder member of the fund, which 
generated a 116 per cent return from 2002-2007, Ian Cameron was paid a 
guaranteed $20,000 a year - the highest paid director.

Ian Cameron died in 2010 aged 77. He was survived by his wife Mary Fleur Cameron.

In 2006 his eldest son Alexander Cameron QC became the sole owner of the family home in Berkshire estimated to be worth more than £2.5million.

Another home in Kensington, London, worth around £1million was passed to his two daughters in equal share.

In a speech to business leaders in Maidenhead in January this year The Prime Minister said: 'With the large companies, that have the fancy corporate lawyers and the rest of it, I think we need a tougher approach.

'One of the things that we are going to be looking at this year is whether there should be a general anti-avoidance power that HMRC can use, particularly with very wealthy individuals and with the bigger companies, to make sure they pay their fair share.'

Downing Street refused to comment on the story  saying it concerned private matters for the Cameron family.

The spokesman said: 'The government's tax reforms are about making sure that some of the richest people in the country pay a decent share of income tax.'
