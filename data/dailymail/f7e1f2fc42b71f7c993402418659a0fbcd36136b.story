Cakes are a treat most of us can’t resist but for Michelle Allen her cake addiction saw her balloon to 26st 1llb and a size 32. 

The catering accountant from Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, finally changed her ways after seeing an unflattering photo and lost 17 stone and 9 dress sizes.

Michelle, 47, says: ‘I’ve been over weight all my life and I put it down to my sweet tooth. If I wanted a cake I used to have it. But I didn’t stop at one - I would eat the whole pack.’

She estimates she spent £8 on two or three cakes a day and has eaten a whopping £87, 360 in cakes over 30 years before changing her ways.

Michelle Allen, who weighed 26 stone at her heaviest, left, has lost 17 stone after giving up sweet treats and cake, right. The former sugar addict claims she spent around £87,000 on cake over 30 years

The slimmer says: ‘Who’d have thought chucking cake down my neck would add up to the cost of a world cruise every year or money towards a bigger house? I’m speechless.’

Thankfully, Michelle is now in better shape since conquering her love of cakes. She joined Cambridge Weight Plan in February 2012 and lost 17st to become a size 12 and 9st 11lb over 18 months.

Michelle says her sweet tooth and weight worries started as a child.

She says, ‘I was always bigger than my friends when I was at school. Mum used to make me healthy meals but I couldn’t help eating cakes and chocolate in between and I wasn’t very sporty.

‘I was a size 18 when I was 16 and a size 20 when I was 18 and I just kept getting bigger and bigger.’

‘Luckily, I wasn’t bullied but inside I wished I was as slim as my friends. I resigned myself to thinking maybe I was just a fat person.’

Michelle blames her love of cakes on her first job as a baker between 16 and 24 years old where she got a love for sweet treats from the bakery.

She says, ‘I’d bake cakes, doughnuts, tarts, buns, you name it and I have to admit making so many tempting things was too hard to resist.’

‘People used to come from miles around to get my chocolate eclairs. Baking was a passion of mine and I’d always eat what I made.’

‘Despite sticking to healthy meals my downfall was that I was a secret eater.’

The catering assistant decided enough was enough after seeing this picture of herself at a wedding. She says she would gorge on cake - eating up to five servings a day

‘I’d treat myself to two a three cakes a day when I was on a break or at lunch or even on the way home while filling up with petrol or buying dinner so nobody knew how much I’d had.’

When Michelle was 22 and a size 18 she got married to Paul Joslin, 23, an electrician and had their daughter Philippa 2 years later.

But the marriage wasn’t a happy one and it broke up when Philippa was six months old.

She says, ‘My size was nothing to do with the break up. We grew apart.’

When her daughter was 4 years old Michelle went back to college studying business and six months later become a catering accountant but her love of sweet treats continued.

When she was 34 the slimmer met her second husband, Jason Allen, 30, a head caretaker when and a size 22.

She confesses, ‘Jason loved me for me and didn’t care about my weight. By my thirties I resigned myself to always being big.’

‘I was lucky I didn’t have any serious health problems but the extra weight caused me to get red raw skin between my thighs where my legs rubbed and together and I was always tired.’

Everything changed when Michelle was 45 and she went to a friend’s wedding in December 2010.

On her previous eating habits, Michelle says: 'I¿d treat myself to two a three cakes a day when I was on a break or at lunch or even on the way home while filling up with petrol or buying dinner so nobody knew how much I¿d had'

She says, ‘I was a witness and I’d made a real effort with my hair and make up and I wore a beautiful blue dress with control underwear to hold everything in. I thought I looked nice.’

‘But when I saw a photo of me I thought I looked like a beached whale or like the Michelin woman because of my many spare tyres.’

The mum-of-one was so shocked she decided to diet.

She had the perfect goal in mind too.

‘My niece announced she was getting married in September 2013 and her mum – my sister – had sadly died a few years before. I wanted to slim in time for her big day so she’d be proud of me and I wouldn’t embarrass her.’

That same year Michelle’s daughter Philippa, then 20, had lost 2st on the Cambridge Weight Plan and it inspired the 47-year-old to give it a go too.

Michelle joined her local class in March, Cambridgeshire, in February 2012 where she followed a daily diet of three shakes in place of meals.

She says, ‘I thought I’d be starving but after a few days I got used to it and the weight dropped off me.’

‘If I had a hard day my consultant Sue Jones would encourage me. She taught me about non-food rewards like treating yourself to a new top or going and reading a good book.

‘I also found talking to other slimmers on diet forums helped keep me going too.’

The 47-year-old can now stand in one leg of the trousers she used to wear, pictured. She lost her weight by using the Cambridge Weight Plan after her daughter had similar success using the method

The 47-year-old also joined her local gym.

Her consultant explained strenuous exercise wasn’t recommended on such a low-calorie plan so Michelle asked a personal trainer, Hayley Powell, to help design a toning programme of light weights and walking on the treadmill twice a week for an hour.

She says, ‘Exercise used to be something other people did – then I really got into it and noticed it was paying off.’

'My tummy was shrinking and my arms and legs looked more toned. I felt much healthier.’

Michelle was losing nearly a stone a month and before long she had to use the smallest hole on her belts to hold her trousers up.

By the summer of 2012 she’d shed five stone but hadn’t told anyone about her diet for fear she’d fail and everyone would know.

But if she needed any more motivation she was further spurred on when she visited a friend’s house and went to sit down on a plastic chair in the garden.

She recalls, ‘The chair went crunch and it broke!’

‘It was so embarrassing. I couldn’t believe it. Everyone was nice about it but I was horrified.’

Shortly after she also split her trousers while sitting at home on the sofa.

On her new lifestyle and fantastic figure, Michelle says: ' I love shopping now and I buy anything I fancy instead of worrying if it'll fit or be slimming enough'

She recalls, ‘I was determined to keep losing weight after that.’

By November 2013 the accountant had shrunk from a size 32 to a size 12 and lost 17st.

She gradually phased out her daily shakes and began eating healthily with the help of her consultant.

To her delight the weight stayed off.

Michelle is still a regular at the gym and goes four times a week for an hour and a half.

It means she can callow herself a treat of the occasional slice of cake.

She says, ‘If it’s a special occasion I’ll let myself have a cake or some chocolate but I make sure I have a small amount and don’t go back for seconds.’

‘Being slim has made my confidence soar. I look and feel like a different person and I’m not going back to being 26 stone again.’

The 47-year-old has treated herself to some new clothes.

She says, ‘I’ve got lots of dresses now in all shapes and sizes. I love shopping now and I buy anything I fancy instead of worrying if it’ll fit or be slimming enough.’

But the biggest treat of all is being able to look in the mirror and see a new, super slim person staring back at her.

What’s more, Michelle reached her goal of slimming in time for her niece’s wedding last year.

She recalls, ‘I fitted in a beautiful size 12 dress by the time her big day came round. It felt great.

‘Unlike the photo from my friend’s wedding, these snaps are ones to be proud of.

‘I even enjoyed a slice of wedding cake – I just made sure it was a small one’
