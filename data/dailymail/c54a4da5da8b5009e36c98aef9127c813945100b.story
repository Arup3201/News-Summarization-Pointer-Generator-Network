Harry Redknapp has challenged Charlie Austin to score at least 20 goals this season for him to be considered for a place in the England team.

England manager Roy Hodgson is keeping an eye on the Queens Park Rangers striker, who has scored six goals in 10 appearances this season, including strikes against Chelsea and Manchester City in their previous two matches.

Facing Newcastle on Saturday is the first chance for Austin to impress since Hodgson revealed he is close to a call-up to the national team.

Redknapp said: His target’s got to be as near to 20 goals as he can this year and if he does that he’s proved he’s a Premier League goalscorer.

‘People go "can he score in the Southern League" – he’s come from the league below the Southern League. Can he go on from the Southern League? I think he was at Bournemouth for a while, they were looking at him, didn’t take him.

‘Then he ends up at Swindon and proves he can score goals at Swindon then he goes up a step again to Burnley. It’s been gradual. Can he score in the Championship? Yeah, he can. Then, can he score in the Premier League? Now he’s showing that he can so he’s just got to keep doing that.’

At 25-years-old, Austin has been a late-developer into a top flight forward. His rise from non-League is well-documented and Redknapp believes Austin is a throwback to the 1990s when star players would regularly emerge from outside of professional football.

‘Years ago there used to be loads that’d come out,’ Redknapp added. ‘Les Ferdinand, Stuart Pearce, Ian Wright, Alan Pardew all played non-League. There were so many of them in those days. It was just a conveyor belt of players out of non-League.’
