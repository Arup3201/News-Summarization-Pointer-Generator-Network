Almost as many Poles have moved to Britain as live in their country’s second city Krakow.

They make up around half the 1.3million eastern Europeans in the UK.

Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday revealed the true impact of expanding the EU to include members of the former Eastern Bloc in 2004.

By 2013, there were 679,000 people from Poland who had moved to Britain. Krakow is home to 750,000 people.

When other ex-Soviet countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia are included, the total of eastern Europeans in the UK rises to 1.27million. 

This represents 25.8 per cent of all foreigners living in the country last year. 

The total is now likely to be even higher since the figures pre-date Romanians and Bulgarians being given open access to the UK jobs market on January 1 this year.

Figures released last week show that, in the year to September 2014, around 135,000 people from these two countries had registered for national insurance numbers. 

It comes at a time of continued controversy over government efforts to control immigration from within the EU which was a major factor behind the Conservatives last week missing their target of reducing net migration – currently 260,000 – to the ‘tens of thousands’. 

Statement: Prime Minister David Cameron delivered his long-awaited speech on immigration last week - pledging to make Britain less attractive to migrants

David Cameron said he now planned to make migrants wait for four years before they could claim both in-work and out-of-work benefits. 

However, to the anger of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, he stopped short of imposing an ‘emergency brake’ on EU citizens after Germany made it clear the proposal would be unacceptable.

Overall, the OECD said the number of foreign nationals living in the country rose by more than 3 per cent to 4.9million last year, representing 7.9 per cent of the UK’s total population.

Poles were the largest foreign group, accounting for 14 per cent of all foreign citizens in Britain.

The OECD report said that in 2013 a record 2.66million foreign nationals – migrants who have not been given UK citizenship – were working in the UK. 

More than a third of them were highly skilled and almost four in ten worked in London. However, the unemployment rate for foreign nationals was higher than for Britons at 9.2 per cent compared to 7.6 per cent. 

The foreign national category does not include people who arrived in Britain as immigrants but who have since been awarded citizenship and a UK passport.

Deutschland: Germany - not the UK - is the main destination of free movement within the European Union, an international economic organisation has said

Figures for each country in the OECD for 2012 show that in that year the UK was the third most popular destination for long-term migrants, behind only the US and Germany.

Last month it was revealed that Britain is handing out citizenship to more migrants than any other EU country after an influx of foreigners lasting more than a decade.

Official figures published by Eurostat, the official statistics organisation of the European Commission, showed this country gave citizenship to 193,900 people in 2012.

At 23.7 per cent, that was the highest proportion of almost 820,000 foreigners given citizenship by any of the 28 EU nations. 

In total, more than 2.1million people from overseas have been given British citizenship since the turn of the century.

For migrants moving from one EU country to another, Germany is the main destination. 

Nearly 30 per cent of migrants moving under free movement rules within the EU in 2012 travelled to Germany, compared to 7 per cent that moved to the UK, the OECD said.
