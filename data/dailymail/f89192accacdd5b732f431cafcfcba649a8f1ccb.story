An Australian man on trial for murdering his wife had been complaining of that she was boring in bed and a ‘terrible cook,’ a court has been told.

Klaus Andres, 70 has previously admitted to dissolving the body of Li Ping Cao, 42, in a wheelie bin filled with acid.

Prior to Ms Cao’s death, Andres had complained that she was boring in bed and a ‘terrible cook,’ Cairns Supreme Court heard.

Dead: The body of Li Ping Cao, 42, was dissolved in acid after her death in October 2011

Klaus Andres is on trial over the 
alleged murder of his Chinese-born wife of five years, said to have 
taken place in the couple’s home in Brinsmead, an upmarket Cairns 
suburb, late October, 2011.

He
has pleaded guilty to causing her death and interfering with her body, 
but says her death was an accident as a result of him pushing her onto 
the kitchen floor after she stabbed him in the hand with a fork.

After Ms Cao died Andres bought 60 litres of acid and dissolved his wife’s body in a wheelie bin.

This week, John Gunner, the husband of
a friend of Andres’ Thai mistress, told Cairns Supreme Court that 
Andres had complained about his wife.

Mr Gunner met 
Andres in August 2011, two months before Ms Cao’s death. Andres had met 
his Thai mistress earlier that year while his wife was in China visiting
relatives.

'[He said] Li Ping would just lie there and he would climb on top of her,' News.com.au reported that Mr Gunner told the court.

‘And [Thai mistress] would hold him and be warm and affectionate.’

Mr Gunner also told the court that Andres had branded Ms Cao a ‘terrible cook’ and that he wanted his Thai mistress to move to Australia.

At the time of the murder neighbours told local news that they had heard the couple argue before the death of Ms Cao.

The trial has been adjourned until Wednesday.
