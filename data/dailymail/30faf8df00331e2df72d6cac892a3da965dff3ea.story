Hawwa Khan, who suffered horrific burns, when she fell on to a gas fire at her home in Bradford

A toddler died when she fell into a gas fire after the fireguard fitted in her home 'wasn't suitable', an inquest heard.

Hawwa Khan was just 23 months old when she died from multiple organ failure after suffering 60 per cent burns when she climbed on to the guard from a footstool and lost her balance at her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire.

The infant had been left unattended for a few seconds when the accident happened in December 2011 and the hearing heard how her clothes ignited as her parents desperately tried to douse the flames.

Hawwa was then rushed to hospital in Bradford before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at Manchester Royal Infirmary, where she later died.

At an inquest, Hawaa's mother Bushra Kauser said it was obvious the fireguard, provided by a council-run home safety scheme, didn't fit the large raised fireplace in their living room.

She said: 'A man came to fit the fireguard about a year before the accident. It was obvious that it wasn't suitable.

'We had been told by the council we were eligible for free home safety measures. Two people came round to inspect our home and sent a man round to fit the fireguard, along with a safety gate, in our home.

'He said the fireplace wasn't completely covered, but that it would do the job. I don't remember being given any documents with instructions on how to use it.

'He just showed me how to hook it to the wall and remove it.'

Ms Kauser also recalled how she had popped out of the room at the time of the incident and then ran back in after she heard her daughter screaming.

The fireguard was made by the Royal Society of Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA) and fitted by firm Crestra Ltd as part of a family safety measures scheme with the local safeguarding children's board.

Glynn Heeney, who fitted the safety device in the house, told the inquest he couldn't recall fitting it in the main living room.

He said: 'I vaguely recall suggesting the guard should go in the upstairs bedroom as the fire in the living room was raised off the ground.

'I remember having some sort of disagreement with the father over where the guard should go.

'If I thought something was unsafe I would always ring my manager, the man who trained me or the office. I would never be persuaded by a persistent customer.'

He added: 'I always leave an instruction manual with the client and go through it with them if needs be. This explains that fireguards shouldn't be climbed on and should be used with parental supervision.'

The inquest also heard from Trading Standards officer Clare Forbes, who said: 'There are are some Trading Standards diagrams which show fireguards which may fit over larger fires such as this one. This particular guard was the only one available through the Safe at Home scheme.

'It was this fireguard or no fireguard at all.

'If the manner in which it is fitted was found to be in breach, the remedy arising from that could be that we take over criminal prosecution with the distributor for causing the fireguard to be unsafe.

'That wasn't done in this case.'

Summing up assistant coroner Oliver Longstaff gave an accidental ruling.

He said: 'These events are events from which no one ever truly recovers. It's only human to cast around to think what could have been done differently.

'There is an irony in the likelihood with how Hawwa came to contact with the fire by the fireguard that was there to protect her.

'Various hypotheses have been brought forward. It's unlikely that Hawwa fell directly into the fire, if so she would not have got out and onto the other side of the fireguard.

'It's also unlikely she climbed over the guard, it was 60cm and she was only a metre tall.'

He said Hawwa's death, on the balance of probabilities, was more to do with the placing of the footstool she used to climb onto the fireguard.

'My conclusion is that wherever [the fireguard] was fitted, the crucial thing was not its presence but the presence next to it of the adjacent piece of furniture,' the assistant coroner added.

'I find it impossible to resolve disputes about whether the fireguard was fitted in the lounge or elsewhere. Both have been given support in the evidence given by people all trying to do their best to prevent any tragedy.

'It is every parent's nightmare to turn away for a few seconds and to have a disaster occur. This was a tragic accident and it is impossible to think of words to say.'

Speaking after the inquest, Hawwa's father Saeed Khan said: 'We have since had two more children and this has given us solace and helped us move on a bit. We've put everything behind us now.'
