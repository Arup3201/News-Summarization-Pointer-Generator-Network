An eight-year-old California boy with dreams of being a pilot died only two days before Father’s Day from injuries sustained in a plane crash earlier this week.

Sebastian Joshua Grewal, of Hesperia, succumbed Friday night to injuries he suffered in the June 9 crash. Pilot Brian Lee, 47, made it to a local hospital but died hours later.

Grewal and Lee never stood a chance, the horrific crash saw the single-engine plane slam in the ground and flip multiple times as it left a debris trail of more than 90 feet. The boy’s father held him as he died.

‘Sebastian passed away last evening peacefully in my arms, surrounded by family. I will cherish the 8 years I had with him on this earth and will re-unite with him when it is my time,’ Joshua Grewal wrote on Facebook.

‘I am humbled and comforted by all the love and support from every one… as I go through the most difficult and darkest hour of my entire life.’

The child loved flying and dreamed of one day becoming a pilot himself, his father said. His final flight was when he was airlifted from the scene to a children’s hospital.

Doctors performed multiple surgeries to try to save his life, including one procedure meant to relieve pressure on his brain, his father told the Victorville Daily Press.

Sebastian Grewal miraculously survived the spectacular crash. He fought five days to stay alive before his body gave out on him.

Joshua Grewal initially held out hope his son would survive.

‘My sweet little boy, my best friend, my EVERYTHING suffered extensive brain injuries in the plane crash and they are doing everything they can.’

Sebastian Grewal was on the plane with Lee, a 25-year veteran firefighter with decades of experience flying helicopters for the Los Angeles Fire Department.

Investigators are still working to determine the cause of the crash, but weather is not believed to be a factor.

‘The pilot began experiencing some 
problems…caused the aircraft to go into a nosedive. When he tried to 
correct and land the aircraft, the aircraft began doing a couple of 
barrel rolls,’ San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson 
Randy Naquin told KCAL.

Lee was taking several people on short flights, including many other retired firefighters.

‘What we came to find out was the aircraft had been towed here by the firefighters. They were out here, basically, camping,’ Naquin added.

Lee is survived by twin daughters.
