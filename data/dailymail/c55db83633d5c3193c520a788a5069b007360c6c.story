A dopey drug dealer who sent text messages to the police offering to sell them cannabis has been jailed for 16 months.

Lee Streeter was out on bail after being caught with a stash of the drug when the officer who arrested him exchanged mobile phone numbers.

A month later PC Daniel Hughes got two text messages from Streeter saying: ‘Safe - got bone dry cheese if u need’ - dealer slang for selling cannabis, Stafford Crown Court heard.

The defendant was arrested again and he told police: 'I accidentally sent it to everyone in my address book.'

Judge John Maxwell jailed Streeter for 16 months.

Sentencing him, he said: 'You were caught for this crime, granted bail and then you did it again - you were offering drugs and you stupidly offered drugs to police officers by sending text messages to the wrong numbers.'

Streeter, 29, of Friar Street, Stafford admitted possessing drugs with intent to supply on 17 June this year and a separate offence of offering to supply cannabis.

Rhiannon Jones, prosecuting, said Streeter was arrested on 17 June when he crashed his motorbike in Queensway, Stafford.

Despite suffering quite serious head injuries, he tried to run off, pursued by paramedics, who caught up with him as he collapsed.

Police were called and helped to restrain Streeter and officers found he had a bag containing cannabis with a street value of £180.

He confessed that he had been dealing to a circle of 15 customers for a period of two months to raise money to fund his own cannabis habit.

Before releasing him on bail, PC Hughes exchanged mobile phone numbers with Streeter.

On 24 July the officer received two text messages from the defendant.

'Fortunately from the Crown’s point of view he sent text messages to the police resulting in his being found out,' said Miss Jones.

Mr Mark Nicholls, defending, said Streeter was under pressure from his supplier to pay for the cannabis he had.
