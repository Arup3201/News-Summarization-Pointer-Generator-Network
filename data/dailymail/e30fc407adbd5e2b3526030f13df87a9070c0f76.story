The man charged with planting a backpack with a rice cooker near the Boston Marathon finish line on the anniversary of the bombing wept in court Wednesday as he was found mentally competent to stand trial.

Kevin Edson, 25, a student at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital in April after being charged with multiple counts, including possession of a hoax device, threatening to commit a crime and disturbance of the peace.

A Boston Municipal Court judge found Edson competent to stand trial and ordered his bail cut in half to $50,000 after hearing from both sides.

Edson also must wear a GPS tracking device, attend counseling and stay on medication. He is due back in court June 3.

His mother, Joie Edson, said he has been battling a bipolar disorder for years. She would not comment after the court appearance.

Kevin Edson wept several times during the hearing, raising his cuffed hands to wipe away tears. His friends and family also sobbed.

Authorities say Edson was spotted by passers-by on Boylston Street near the marathon finish line April 15, a week before this year's race; he was walking barefoot in the rain and wearing a backpack, a black veil and makeup.

Authorities say two unattended backpacks were near the finish line, one of which was Edson's and the other was a misplaced bag from the media.

When police approached him and asked what was inside the bag, he replied a rice cooker. No explosives were found and no one was injured.

Edson's attorney, Shannon Lopez, said Wednesday that her inbox was flooded with emails in support of the Wakefield resident and that multiple doctors say her client is not a danger to himself or others.

She said he also has followed doctors' advice and is willing to continue treatment.

Edson previously had been sent to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered held on $100,000 bail on charges of threatening battery, possession of a hoax explosive device, threats to commit a crime, disturbing the peace, disturbing a public assembly and disorderly conduct.

According to a police report read aloud in court last month, after Edson was read his rights, he told an officer: 'I knew what I was doing, it was conceived in my head. It's symbolism, come on. The performance got the best of me.'

Color coordination: 'Kayvon' Edson's face was painted yellow and blue, the traditional colors of the marathon, when he was arrested Tuesday night after dropping off a backpack with a rice cooker filled with confetti at the finish line on the one-year anniversary of the bombings

Edson's arrest occurred hours after ceremonies to mark last year's Boston Marathon bombings, in which two pressure cooker bombs hidden in backpacks exploded, killing three people near the finish line and injuring more than 260 others.

Edson, with addresses in Boston and Wakefield, was stopped April 15 after passersby told an officer they saw him yelling, walking barefoot down the middle of a street, veiled in black, in pouring rain.

His face was painted yellow and blue, the traditional colors of the marathon, police said.

The street was open to pedestrians at the time, and police said his presence was not a security breach.

Man behind the stunt: Edson told police that he 'got caught up in the performance' when he went through with the bomb scare

Mental problems: Edson's mother said that the former art school student, seen in court April 16, has bipolar disorder

The backpack was destroyed in a controlled explosion by police, who later determined that the contents were not explosive.

Parsons, The New School for Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology, both in New York City, confirmed that Edson had taken classes at their schools but never graduated.

The Massachusetts College of Art and Design posted a statement on its website saying that an undergraduate student had been arrested by police and the school was cooperating with authorities, but it did not mention Edson by name.

The stunt : Witnesses spotted the first bag being dropped off by a 
barefoot man- later identified as Edson- dressed in all black with a black veil who was 'acting 
strangely' and yelling 'Boston Strong!'
