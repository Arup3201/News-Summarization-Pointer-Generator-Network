A six-year-old boy has drowned in the pool of a cruise liner at sea.

Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement that the boy, identified as Qwentyn Hunter, a child model from Winter Garden, Florida, drowned in one of its pools on Sunday afternoon.

Detective Javier Baez of the 
Miami-Dade Police Department said that the boy had been playing with
his 10-year-old brother and other family members in the pool on Sunday afternoon.

Tragic loss: Qwentyn Hunter died aboard a Carnival cruise after attempts to resuscitate him failed

Sad end: The Carnival ship Victory arrived in port in Miami, Florida this morning bearing sad news

Too late: A DJ alerted passengers to the boy underwater in this pool, but it was too late to save him

Grieving: Passengers disembarking the cruise were shaken and upset by Qwentyn Hunter's death

At 4:45pm, he was spotted motionless under the water.

Other passengers pulled the boy from the pool and attempted to revive him but he died onboard the ship.

A
Carnival Cruise Lines spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times that there was no 
lifeguard on duty at the time of Qwentyn Hunter's death.

'We do not have lifeguards on duty at our pools,' Carnival spokeswoman Jayme Weber told the Los Angeles Times on Monday morning.

'Parental supervision is required for children under 13.'

In this case, she said, 'there was a parent present at the time of the incident."

'Carnival extends its heartfelt sympathy to the family during this very difficult time. The company's CareTeam is providing assistance and support,' Carnival Cruise Line said in a statement.

The Carnival Victory ship was on the last leg of a four-day Caribbean cruise when the boy drowned.

The ship arrived early Monday morning at Port Miami.

Qwentyn Hunter was a child model with Ariza Talent and Modeling Agency in Longwood.

The tragic death of six-year-old Qwentyn Hunter is the latest in a string of Carnival Cruise Lines incidents in 2013.February 10: The Carnival Triumph broke down in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,000 passengers aboard.Passengers were stranded for five days in horrific conditions.They
described sewage-soaked floors and people defecating in sinks and 
showers. Passengers had nothing to eat but bread and onions and the ship
was listing badly to one side.Many passengers camped out on deck to escape the smell of sewage which had soaked into the carpet in many suites. There was no water or light so when the sun went down, the ship descended into total darkness.

February 25: 18-year-old high school senior Seth Younes died of alcohol poisoning on the last night of an eight-day Carnival cruise.Carnival Cruise Lines spokesperson Vance Gulliksen said, 'there is no indication he was served any alcohol by shipboard personnel.'

May 8: Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27, were discovered missing when the Carnival Spirit liner docked in Sydney on May 10.
