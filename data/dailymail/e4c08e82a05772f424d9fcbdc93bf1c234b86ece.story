The Togolese striker could easily have been sent off in the 17th minute after he caught Louis Reed in the face with his arm. 

The contact did not appear to be deliberate but he did push Reed in the face. 

Strict referees, who do not permit any contact above the neck, would have dismissed Adebayor but Neil Swarbrick, sensibly, chose to caution him — not surprising for a referee who approves of physical football. 

Swarbrick was then absolutely correct to award Spurs a penalty for a clear handball.

Emmanuel Adebayor cut a frustrated figure at White Hart Lane, and he was jeered  when substituted
