An Oklahoma woman has been charged with child sex abuse and neglect for allegedly trying to molest an 11-year-old relative while keeping him in a filthy home.

Alethea Montgomery, 40, from Piedmont, Oklahoma, was arrested Tuesday after the boy staying with her accused the woman of trying to force herself on him while under the influence of alcohol.

When officers arrived at Montgomery's ranch-style house, the woman was reportedly so drunk that she was deemed unfit for questioning.

Alethea Montgomery, 40, from Piedmont, Oklahoma, was arrested on child sex abuse and neglect charges after the 11-year-old boy staying with her accused the woman of trying to force him to touch her breasts

According to police, the 40-year-old and her young family member were living in deplorable conditions inside a home cluttered with trash and strewn with cat feces and beer cans.

When responding officers opened Montgomery’s refrigerator, they found inside nothing but water, beer and spoiled milk.

The 11-year-old accuser, who had been staying with Alethea Montgomery, told police that he’d gone for weeks without eating or bathing, the station KFOR reported. 

When interviewed by police, the child revealed that one day his 40-year-old caretaker entered his room in a drunken stupor, laid down on his bed and told him to come closer to her.

Montgomery then allegedly instructed the child to touch her exposed breast, but the boy refused and tried to seek refuge behind a curtain.

The inebriated woman then allegedly attempted to force the 11-year-old onto the bed, but he was able to get away and call for help.

House of horrors: Responding officers entered Montgomery's house to discover mounds of trash, cat feces, empty beer cans everywhere and no food in the refrigerator  

Under questioning, Ms Montgomery initially denied having any recollection of the incident, but suggested that perhaps she did something in her sleep.

‘He is not a liar and I do stuff in my sleep. I hope to God I didn’t do something, but if I did, I was asleep,’ she told police, according to an arrest report.

The 40-year-old later changed her story, saying she believed her young relative and said she was sick to her stomach.
