These pictures show the incredible evolution of the food eaten by astronauts as they explored the cosmos over the past 50 years.

NASA has released the images, which show the transition from the meat paste Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, sucked from a toothpaste tube to the gourmet meals astronauts currently enjoy.

The pictures were posted on the space agency's website by NASA's Space Food Systems Laboratory, where the agency researches, tests, and produces food fit for consumption outside of the Earth's atmosphere.

Stellar cuisine: NASA have released photos chronicling the evolution of the food eaten in space. Pictured is a tray of food eaten on the Skylab, America's first space station, from 1973 - 1974

Appetizing: Food from the Apollo missions from 1968-1972 was carefully vacuum-packed and balanced for nutrition but was not exactly gourmet

Reheating: These packages of thermostabilised foods such as cheddar cheese spread and even hot-dogs are heated to destroy pathogens, microorganisms and enzymes that may make it go off

For over 50 years, the methods involved in the preservation process have evolved.  Astronauts have gone from eating seed and crackers to home-cooked style dishes including shrimp, Spanish rice for a 'paella in space' dish and even ice cream.

Nutrition in space is incredibly complicated.

Everything from the packaging to the 
menu has to be meticulously evaluated as the food must balance 
nutrition, flavour, and safety with more practical concerns such as 
preparation time, size, and shelf life.

High tea: The Atlantis space shuttle's STS-110 crew eating on board the International Space Station

Eighties food: Shuttle 're-hydratables' used from 1981-1989. Food is sucked clear of all water and must be placed into hot water and 'rehydrated' before consumption

Colourful: Now food is freeze-dried and maintains its resemblance to the shrimp, paella and beef jerky but fruit and vegetables can also be taken and stored at room temperature

Weightlessness affects almost every system in the body, including those of the bones, muscles, heart and blood vessels, and nerves.

The top priority is to ensure that the astronauts get the proper amount of nutrients, calories and minerals to maintain their physical health and performance for the life of the mission.

Calorie requirements differ for astronauts. For instance, a small woman would require only about 1,900 calories a day, while a large man would require about 3,200 calories - about 800 more than on Earth.

To complicate matters, spaceflight nutritional requirements are influenced by many of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight.

Also, the lack of gravity means smell - and taste - is impaired.

Foods are either partially or completely
dehydrated to prevent them from spoiling. Meats are exposed to 
radiation before they are put onboard the shuttle to give them a longer 
shelf life.

Meals are organized by the order in 
which astronauts are going to eat them, and stored in locker trays held 
by a net so they won't float away.

They heat foods in a forced-air 
convection oven that's kept between 160 and 170 degrees Fahrenheit. It 
takes about 20 to 30 minutes to rehydrate and heat an average meal.

Aside from keeping the astronauts' bellies full, food plays another vital role - keeping up morale.

According to NASA, it 'not only provides nutrition for astronauts, but also enhances the psychological well-being of the crew by establishing a familiar element in an unfamiliar and hostile environment'.

Studies have shown that eating certain foods - such as meatloaf and mashed potatoes or turkey on Thanksgiving - improve people's mood and give them satisfaction.

Before food is approved, astronauts make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final OK on Earth before it blasts off.

And research into the next generation of space food is currently underway, as humanity turns its gaze towards Mars.

It might be the case that astronauts will grow their own food aboard the vessel as it hurtles towards the red plant. It is estimated that any manned mission to Mars will take three years, meaning thousands of meals must be provided.

A statement from the Space Food Systems Laboratory said: 'The current crew member diet is completely supplied through prepackaged, shelf-stable food items produced on Earth.

'The duration of future missions may require a portion of the diet to be grown, processed, and prepared in the space habitat.'

As other nations enter the space race, the variety of cuisine has widened considerably. On China's first manned space flight, Astronaut Yang Liwei ate yuxiang pork, kung pao chicken, and eight treasures rice, along with Chinese herbal tea.

South Korea’s first astronaut, Yi So-yeon, was a crew member on the International Space Station and brought a special version of Korea's national dish, kimchi.

It took three research institutes several years and millions of dollars to create a version of the fermented cabbage dish that was suitable for space travel.

Basic: Foods eaten on the Mercury and Gemini missions from 1961-1966 including fruit cake and chicken sandwiches (centre)

No ordinary lunch box: International Space Station food containers packed with sachets of dinner

Flavours: Now a wide selection of drinks is available to astronauts including tea with lemon, Hawaiian coffee, hot chocolate and a selection of fruit juices

The first man in space Yuri Gagarin ate pureed meat from toothpaste tubes as he orbited the Earth in 1961.

When Americans followed the Russians into space they quickly developed freeze dried foods for the Project Mercury missions.

However astronauts found the offerings unappetising and hard to rehydrate.

By the time of the Gemini missions from 1965-6 the flavours had improved and the menu included shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables and butterscotch pudding.

Astronauts now make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final OK on Earth before it blasts off.
