Let down: John Morgan, 71, believes if he had been diagnosed sooner he may not have lost sight in his right eye

A grandfather has been left blind in one eye after medics missed four opportunities to diagnose a treatable disease.

John Morgan, 71, from Ormskirk, visited an optician, a GP and four separate hospitals before he was finally treated for wet Age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

The condition is the most common cause of blindness in the UK affecting around 500,00 people.

But by then he was told the disease was so far advanced nothing could be done and he has permanently lost vision in his right eye.

The ordeal began when Mr Morgan, a retired HGV driver, started experiencing eyesight problems two years ago and booked an appointment at a Boots opticians.

He was told he probably had 'astigmatism' a common eye defect.

But months later he felt the situation had got worse and went to see his GP.

He was referred to Ormskirk Hospital but had to wait around three weeks for an appointment.

'Coloured objects in my right eye seemed 
faded and there was a slight tinge to straight lines. The GP sent me to 
Ormskirk Hospital and I had drops put in my eye and dye in the vein and 
it was then that I heard him say it could be something to do with the 
macular,' said Mr Morgan.

The father-of-three was given a 'vague' diagnosis of AMD but was not given any treatment.

Instead he was sent to Southport Hospital because 'they had better equipment'. But again this took several weeks and the same tests were repeated.

'When I finally had the appointment 
the nurse seemed quite shocked and taken a back by how much the sight in
my right eye had deteriorated between coming to them and being 
initially seen at Ormskirk,' said Mr Morgan.

He was then transferred to a third hospital -Â  Fazakerley Hospital in Liverpool.

'There
was no fast tracking me to get an appointment there either and when I 
did finally see someone they looked at my right eye and told me there 
was nothing they could do for me and I was basically told to go away,' 
he added.

Mr Morgan was still unable to get a proper diagnosis for his eye condition after visiting Fazakerley Hospital (Aintree University Hospital)

Determined to get a proper diagnosis, Mr Morgan went to a fourth hospital where he was finally told he was suffering from wet AMD.

But by this point there was nothing that could be done as his macular had deteriorated so badly.

'They said "sorry, you're too late, we can't do anything for you. The damage is done." I feel strongly that I should have been fast tracked and that I should have been sent to the right hospital straight away,' he said.

'I feel like I've been really let down by the system. There was no sense of urgency in any of this. I just got pushed from hospital to hospital and because of the delays I've now lost the central vision in my right eye for good.

'I should have been treated better than this. They knew how rapidly I could lose my sight by there was delay after delay,' he added.

Mr Morgan now has to rely heavily on his left eye and fears that his partial blindness will stop him enjoying his hobby of riding vintage motorbikes.

'If I'd known back then what I know now, I would have been shouting from the roof tops demanding treatment right from the start. This can't continue to happen to other people,' he said.

Ormskirk and Southport NHS Hospital Trust said it was unable to comment on an individual case.

A spokesman for Aintree University Hospitals Trust said: 'If Mr Morgan needs to raise any issues about the care he received, he should contact our customer care team and we would be happy to discuss this further with him.'

Boots Opticians failed to respond to a request for comment.
