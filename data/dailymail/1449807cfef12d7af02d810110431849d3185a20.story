The ultimate power couple, world footballer of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and Russian supermodel Irina Shayk, have appeared even more glamorous than usual in a racy shoot for Vogue Spain.

Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo was styled by Mother Nature for the cover image in Vogue Espana, with Shayk shielding his modesty in front of him wearing a strapless white dress.

The shoot by renowned glossy photographer Mario Testino back in March was the first time the pair, neither of course strangers to the front side of a camera lens, have modelled as a duo.

The coverline of 'Amor & Fútbol', meaning 'Love and Football', gave the theme of the spread that inside also includes the pair posing in close embraces wearing nothing but designer briefs.

One intriguing image features Cristiano, now in preparations for the World Cup with Portugal after Real finished third in La Liga, sitting on what appears to be a hotel bed wearing a suit and tie. A whiteboard shows positional tactics and his latest Nike commercial is on the TV as the Ballon d'Or winner juggling a ball - Irina meanwhile stands looking into the distance holding either a phone or remote control.

While Ronaldo has been dabbling in 
Shayk's modelling world for years, she got her own back with one set-up 
including her in boots and shinpads, though her towel-over-the-head 
under a hood look was more akin to boxing.

Back in his day job as one of the finest
 footballers of his generation, Ronaldo sat out Real's final La Liga 
match of the season ahead of their Champions League final clash with 
Spanish league winners Atletico on Saturday.

Ronaldo was named ahead of the 3-1 win over Espanyol that saw them finish the season level on points with Barcelona, but was pulled from the line-up moments before kick-off amid concerns over a hamstring injury.

Real will be chasing their 10th European Cup title in Lisbon, but from these images it appears their star striker is already a big winner.
