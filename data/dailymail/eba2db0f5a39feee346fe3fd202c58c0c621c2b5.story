Princess Anne’s former husband, Captain Mark Phillips, is to divorce for the second time after a year-long romance with a woman 30 years his junior.

The 63-year-old – who is father to the Queen’s grandchildren Peter and Zara Phillips – has left his wife Sandy for American equestrienne Lauren Hough, it emerged last night.

It is understood Captain Phillips has already left the marital home in Cherington, Gloucestershire, and plans to set up home with Miss Hough, 35, in Florida.

Sources close to the captain told the
Daily Telegraph that he broke the news to his 58-year-old wife and 
their 14-year-old daughter Stephanie earlier this year.

He has reportedly told friends that ‘I might only be alive for another five or ten years so I might as well be happy’.

The
couple’s separation and forthcoming divorce have been confirmed in a 
statement from Captain Phillips’s solicitors at the law firm CKFT.

It said: ‘Captain and Mrs Mark Phillips are separating and divorce proceedings have commenced.

The couple have a daughter, aged 14, and the care and support of her is Captain Phillips’s main concern at this sensitive time.

It is not clear whether the romance 
was responsible for the breakdown of his marriage, but friends of Miss 
Hough claim the couple have been openly living together at her home in 
Florida for the past few months.

‘He therefore requests that all parties respect their privacy in the months ahead.’

Captain Phillips, an Olympic gold 
medallist in three-day eventing, met Miss Hough through his work as 
trainer of the US eventing team. He lives in America for several months 
of the year.

She bears an uncanny resemblance to 
his second wife when she was younger and shares his passion for horses –
a love he has passed down to his daughter, Zara, who has hopes of 
making this summer’s British Olympics eventing team.

Captain Phillips has even met his new
partner’s parents, Charles ‘Champ’ Hough, 70, and his 68-year-old wife 
Linda, several times.

Since leaving the military Mark Phillips, pictured competing at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1976, has spent his life in the world of equestrianism - so it is little wonder that it is through his love of horses that he met the women in his life.

In 1972, at the age of 23, Captain Phillips was a member of the British three-day event team that won the gold medal at the Munich Olympics. It was at the Games that he met Princess Anne.

The couple got engaged the following year.

As well as Olympics success, Captain Phillips won the Badminton Horse Trials in 1971 and 1972 riding Great Ovation, in 1974 on Colombus, and in 1981 on Lincoln.

After he retired from the Army, he continued to style himself Captain Mark Phillips - which was allowed as junior cavalry officers whose civilian work involves equestrianism may continue to use their rank.

By 1990, with his marriage on the rocks, Captain Phillips was in a relationship with Hawaiian-born Sandy Pflueger, who had been part of the US dressage team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The couple married in 1997.

And now, as he confirms his divorce from his second wife, it emerges that the new woman in his life is Lauren Hough - who represented the US int he 2000 Olympics and still works with the US eventing team, which Captain Phillips also helps train.

They are said to have found him immensely likeable – which is not entirely surprising, as they are clearly far closer to him in age.

A relative of Miss Hough, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: ‘Champ and Linda are quite old fashioned and, I suspect, would not have approved of their daughter seeing a married man.

But I know they have met Mark many times when in Florida and do like him.

‘Other people in the family knew she was seeing Mark and of course everyone was aware of who he was and his royal connections.’

Another friend added: ‘It was pretty much well known among the equestrian community there that Mark and Lauren were an item.

They did not really try to hide it in the last couple of months, but were still very careful not to be seen to be photographed together or holding hands. They were always very discreet.’

Miss Hough’s £300,000 home is situated on the exclusive Palm Beach Polo and Hunt Club, a sprawling development of gated communities in Wellington, Florida that boasts its own equestrian facilities as well as an 18-hole golf course.

Rene Chambers, a former neighbour, said she would often see Capt Phillips’s silver Range Rover parked in the driveway of the three bedroom home – even though he would ostensibly stay in a rented house on the same development while working in Wellington, known as the equestrian capital of the US.

‘He was always very friendly and we loved his accent. I had no idea he was from the Royal Family.

'We just thought he was part of the horsey set that live all around here.

'That is neat to know that he was related to the Queen,’ she said.

Miss Hough sold her home in March this year and the couple are now said to be looking for a property in the area to buy together.

There was no sign of Mrs Phillips yesterday at the family farm in Cherington, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and a member of staff said she did not wish to comment.

Captain Phillips was divorced by Princess Anne in 1992 after it was confirmed he had fathered a child outside of the marriage.

He married Hawaiian-born Sandy Pflueger in 1997. She was part of the US dressage team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and went on to help coach the US team alongside her husband.

When they married, she became stepmother to Zara and Peter. Last year she joined her husband for Zara’s wedding in Edinburgh.

Miss
Hough was part of the US team at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, and will 
also be helping coach the current US team alongside Captain Phillips at 
the London 2012 Games

According
to sources, the pair recently told members of the US eventing team 
about their relationship to ‘get it out in the open’.

Sources close to Miss Hough said the couple were house-hunting together in Florida.

On her personal website she lists as hobbies cooking, reading, working out in the gym and ‘hanging out with her dog, April’.

Captain
Phillips also met Princess Anne through horses. She rode for Britain in
the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, four years after he won a gold medal at 
the 1972 Munich Olympics. They married in 1973.

In 1984, however, he fathered a love child, Felicity, with art teacher Heather Tonkin after a one-night stand in New Zealand.

He has never publicly acknowledged his daughter.

The pair met through their work with the U.S. eventing team ahead of this summer's Olympics
