Obie the obese Dachshund who found fame last month after tipping the scales at 77 pounds is in the midst of a bitter custody battle.

The mammoth mutt, who is so overweight he needs to wear a harness to stop his body dragging on the ground, was temporarily adopted by former veterinary technician Nora Vanatta after his elderly owners almost fed him to death.

But Oregon Dachshund Rescue owner Jenell Rangan has accused the woman of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and is fighting for custody.

Obie became a nationwide celebrity after appearing on TV shows such as 'Live With Kelly and Michael' and the Today Show with Ms Vanatta, who put him on a drastic diet.

A Facebook page that chronicles his weight loss now has more than 67,000 followers.

But the rescue centre claims to be Obie's owner and in court papers filed on October 22 accuses Ms Vanatta of 'wrongfully' holding the dog in an effort to get famous and pocket the donations that are flowing in to help pay for his care.

'They say I'm exploiting him,' Ms Vanatta told KATU.com. 'They say I'm misusing his funds and they claim he belongs to them.'

The woman has collected thousands of dollars from Obie's supporters. But she insists that everything she's done for the dog in the past two months that he's been in her care is beneficial.

Obie has already shed 15 pounds, she said, and her goal is to have him slim down by 40 pounds.

'The money just sits there because he may need to have surgery to have his excess skin removed,' Ms Vanatta said. 'You know, we just don't know where, what he's really going to need.'

Oregon Dachshund Rescue put out an online plea for help when they heard the dog was in need of a home.

A rescue centre volunteer picked up Obie from his former owners and delivered him to Ms Vanatta after she volunteered to help.

Big boy: At five and a half stone - the equivalent of 77 lbs - Obie is the world's fattest Dachshund

'He's famous and heâ€™s touched so many people and I think they regret not taking him on in the first place,' she said.

Dubbed
the world's fattest sausage dog, Obie found fame in September after Ms 
Vanata put him on a drastic diet to try and get him back into shape.

Obie,
who is double the size of an average Dachshund, was nearly fed to death
by his doting elderly owners who had to give him up because of their 
deteriorating health.

A Dachshund normally has a maximum weight of 32 pounds - a little over two stone - with Obie more than twice the size at the age of just five.

Dieting: Obie, aged five, has now been taken in by vet Nora Vanetta in Portland, Oregon, who is determined to get him back in shape

Counting calories: As Obie is too big to exercise, he has been put on a special diet and hydrotherapy regime

Beach time: Ms Vanatta said the pooch has already lost 15 pounds

Ms Vanatta said: 'He arrived on August 18 and to my astonishment he was a dachshund and he actually weighed 77 lbs.

'He is extremely sweet and loving. He
was obviously loved and is a joy to work with. The aging owners just 
couldn't say no to those big brown eyes.

'But we are thrilled to be able to help him, and now moving on with his new life.'

Ms Vanatta,
who has a degree in animal science and is a certified veterinary 
technician, said the dog's staggering weight meant she was unable to take him out for exercise.

Instead, she resorted to a special diet and hydrotherapy in an attempt to shed the pounds. She wants to get the sausage dog down to between 30 and 40 pounds.

Winner: A judge will decide on Monday who gets to keep the mammoth mutt

Working out: Obie has a Facebook page, Biggest Loser, Doxie Edition, where people can track his progress

Tipping the scales: Obie is double the size of most Dachshunds that normally have a maximum weight of 32 pounds

Ms Vanatta set up a Paypal page to encourage people to donate money to pay for Obie's care and the donations have been flowing in.

When she embarked on the project, she said: 'I feel tremendously blessed to be involved in his rehabilitation and I am amazed at the outpouring of love and support that I have received.

'My hope is that he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight.

'It is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible.'
