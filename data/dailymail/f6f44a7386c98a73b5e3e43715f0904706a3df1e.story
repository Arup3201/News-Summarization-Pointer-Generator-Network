NASCAR superstar Tony Stewart has gone into hiding after the weekend crash that killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr in a sprint car race in upstate New York.

Stewart's private plane flew into his hometown of Columbus, Indiana, on Monday and luggage was loaded on to it and it then flew out again, airport director Brian Payne told MailOnline.

Stewart is 'staying with friends', his 
team's spokesman Mike Arning said. He still has made no decision on when
 to return to racing.

Gone: Beleaguered NASCAR driver Tony Stewart has flown the coop following the crash killing fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. It is believed he flew off to parts unknown

High flyer:  It is believed Stewart took off in his $6 million 10-seater Dassault-Breguet Falcon 50, similar to the one pictured here. Stewart's plane has a skull with a top hat with 'smoke' - Stewart's logo - surrounded by flames painted on the tail

'It was only here 10 or 15 minutes,' said Payne. 'I don't know whether Stewart was on board, but he certainly did not get off.'

Payne would not say where the plane was headed. According to the website FlightAware which follows the movements of private planes, Stewart's 10-seater Dassault-Breguet Falcon 50, plane which can cost $6million or more, cannot be tracked publicly 'per request from the owner/operator'.

County sheriff Philip C. Povero announced his office will continue the investigation into Kevin Ward Jr's shocking death for at least two more weeks.

'Investigators continue to seek witnesses, gather evidence and develop racetrack crash reconstruction,' Povero said.

Kevin Ward Sr told Syracuse.com that his son was dressed in an orange and black suit with fluorescent stripes down the sides that glowed under the lights.

'Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,' he said.

Stewart's decision to disappear from public view also comes as criticism for his role in Saturday's accident that killed 20-year-old racer Kevin Ward Jr. at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park has heated up.

Many fans blame Stewart, 43, for the death even though Ward had walked along the track to confront the older driver after being forced off the track.

Even in his home state opinions are divided. Bob Kravitz, a columnist for the Indianapolis Star, was skeptical about Stewart's claims of innocence.

'Ultimately, only Tony Stewart knows whether he accidentally or willfully ran over and killed Kevin Ward Jr,' Kravitz wrote.

'If it was an accident, and we prefer to believe that's the case, he will be able to live with himself, although the memory will remain with him always.

Driven: Ward was on the darkened dirt track Canandaigua Motorsports Park in Central Square, N.Y., trying to confront Stewart following a bump with Stewart one lap earlier when he was fatally hit by Stewart

'If he was overcome by rage and did less than his best to avoid the 20-year-old Ward, Jr., he will have to live with that messy lie the rest of his natural life.'

Stewart's only comment on the tragedy was to issue a statement on Sunday saying: 'There aren’t words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr. It’s a very emotional time for all involved…. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy.'

But even that statement was attacked by Ward's aunt Wendi Ward who sarcastically tweeted the message 'Thanks for thinking of our family Tony Stewart when you decided to be a d—k!'

Authorities are looking at two separate videos of the incident taken by fans at Canandaigua. They appear to show Stewart accelerating as he came close to Ward, who was wearing dark clothing. He hit the younger driver with his rear right tire pulling him beneath the car and then throwing him in the air. Ward died of massive blunt trauma to the head, an autopsy found.

The accident occurred around 10.30 pm. Stewart's camp has claimed the driver did not see him, but another driver, Paul Kinney, told NBC News: 'Only Tony knows exactly what happened. I seen Kevin clear as day. Nobody else ran into him, either.' 

Shuttered: Stewart ives in a 15,700 sq. ft. custom-built 6-bedroom, 12-bath log cabin compound outside Columbus, Indiana, the town in which he grew up. But sources say he has decamped 'with friends'

Sheriff Philip Povero of Ontario County, which covers Canandaigua, said no criminal charges are pending against three-time NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Stewart, but investigations were continuing. He said Stewart had been cooperating with authorities,

Stewart, whose hot-headeness on the racetrack has brought him legions of both devoted fans and intractable foes, lives in a 15,700 sq. ft. custom-built 6-bedroom, 12-bath log cabin compound outside Columbus, Indiana, the town in which he grew up.

The website of the company that built the house on Youth Camp Road says: 'From the minute one pulls up to the log home and parks under the porte cochére, they will notice the immense size of the home accented by a custom three tiered retaining wall constructed of large natural stone boulders to the west. A stream and pond tying into a fresh water fish aquarium will wrap around the great room to a two-story picture window with a view of Stewart's lake, all of which allow Stewart to enjoy his passion for nature year round.

The lower level is designed to entertain guests through various eye catching amenities. As one descends down the curved log staircase encased by a natural rock wall, they will enter a large bar room with billiards, shuffle board, numerous televisions, and two racing display cases flanking an Indy car hung on the wall. On low key nights, Tony Stewart and his guests may prefer to watch a movie in the media room or play poker in the card room.'

But Stewart — who has never married and has no children — is now staying far from the compound, which also includes a bowling alley and elevator.

He has still to decide whether to compete in this weekend's NASCAR event at the Michigan International Speedway. 'He will have as much time as he needs to make that decision,' said Arning. 'It is still an emotional time for all involved, Tony included.

'He is grieving and grief doesn't have a timetable.'

Stewart's future could still be in doubt if his sponsors - including Mobil, Coca Cola and car dealership J.D. Byrider - decide to abandon him to keep their names away from controversy. All are monitoring the situation.

'Even if he’s cleared of any wrongdoing, it’s uncertain how many corporations would want a grinning Stewart pitching their products after this sort of tragedy,' Slate reports.

Many racing fans are attacking him for his actions. On Stewart's own Facebook page, a man identifying himself as 'King Joe Shearer' wrote: 'Watch the video...you hear Stewart rev his engine...it looks like homicide.'

Another fan, Lucian Hughes, added: That was no mistake, that was Tony being his usual bullheaded self and wasn't gone let some kid show him up and it cost Ward his life and Tony his career.'

But he also got plenty of support. Kathy Neal wrote: 'Tony, please do not listen the negative people out there, You did nothing wrong, you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Get back in the car and race, put this behind you and move on.'

And Patrick Moore added: Lesson is - Don't run around on a live track. It was unfortunate that the guy got so close to Tony and got hit but don't blame Tony for someone else's mistake.'
