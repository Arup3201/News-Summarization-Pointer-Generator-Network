After overlooking Lionel Messi’s trip to Casino de Barcelona on Saturday evening, Luis Enrique used the same betting strategy as every other coach in the club’s recent history.

Play it straight, put all your worldly possessions on Barcelona’s No 10 and cash in at the end of the night.

From these positions, the last throw of the dice, Lionel Messi used to be as safe as houses.

Instead, the Barcelona forward skulked off at the final whistle, looking like a man who had done all his money after failing to convert a 90th-minute penalty. The little man was distraught.

Messi has missed five of his last 10 from the spot for Barcelona and Argentina, a worrying trend for someone who many still regard as the world’s best footballer. To be fair to him, he played like it.

By the time Pablo Zabaleta brought him down in the final minute, Messi’s work for the night had already been done.

He had wreaked havoc, given the run of the place by Manchester City’s benevolent defence as Luis Suarez put Barcelona into a commanding first-leg lead.

The only thing missing from this bravura Messi performance was the name of the No 10 on the huge television screens hanging off the stands at the Etihad.

With 37 goals already this season, including eight in the Champions League, it would take a brave man to back against him from 12 yards out. Last year, he opened the scoring here from the spot in the 54th minute.

The only thing missing from this bravura Messi performance was the name of the No 10 on the huge television screens hanging off the stands at the Etihad.

With 37 goals already this season, including eight in the Champions League, it would take a brave man to back against him from 12 yards out. Last year, he opened the scoring here from the spot in the 54th minute.

This time Joe Hart denied him, saving brilliantly as Messi went straight and getting up in time to witness the forward tamely head the rebound wide of the post.

This time Joe Hart denied him, saving brilliantly as Messi went straight and getting up in time to witness the forward tamely head the rebound wide of the post.

‘It was an important save and 3-1 would have been a difficult score for us to progress because it was a very unnecessary, emotional foul,’ admitted City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini.

These spot-kicks are playing on Messi, gnawing away at this little genius after his failure to put away his penalty in the Copa del Rey against Real Madrid last month. On that occasion, he scored the rebound.

A third Barcelona goal would surely have finished this tie, putting it beyond the reach of City in the second leg on March 18. At 2-1, it still feels like there is far much for Pellegrini’s team to do.

Even those connected to the Etihad concede that, penalty apart, this was a breathtaking performance by the three-time world player of the year. The set up for Suarez’s second goal was agonising for City as he drew four defenders towards him and then twisted his way through them. Sir Alex Ferguson, watching from the stands, would have appreciated that moment more than most.

When Messi finally released the ball into the path of left-back Jordi Alba, his cross found the onrushing figure of Suarez to meet it from close range. Barcelona’s No 9 scored it, Messi made it.

At times he was mouth-watering, particularly when he raised that left boot into the night sky to pull down a bizarre up and under from Suarez inside the area.

Do you applaud a skill like that, accept it comes naturally to this gifted forward, or try to work out how the hell anyone will ever be able to stop him? Possibly all three.

Here, Gael Clichy, the man you would loosely describe as Messi’s marker, was sent off for a second booking and will miss the second leg in the Nou Camp.

Clichy will not forget this night in a long while. Incredibly the left back’s two cautions had nothing to do with Messi and he was sent off in the 74th minute for a foul on Dani Alves. By then, he had been shredded by Messi.

This was also a bad night for City’s captain Vincent Kompany after he headed down into the path of Suarez to open the scoring in the 16th minute. No-one knows if Kompany is any good any more, or whether this City defence is just to bad at the highest level of the European game that he keeps being exposed.Either way he escaped when he brought down Messi as he made his way into the area, with German referee Felix Brych giving him the benefit of the doubt.

It is incredible that Pellegrini made no special plans to contain one of the best players we have witnessed.

Messi’s intelligence is remarkable, working it all out tactically in his head in the opening five minutes and instructing Suarez to switch positions. Messi had the City defence worked out.

After Sergio Aguero’s 69th-minute strike, City travel to the Nou Camp for the second leg believing they can get back into this tie.

Their only hope now is to put Messi back on the spot.
