What Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done with Jordan Henderson deserves more recognition. It’s almost gone under the radar that Henderson is now a regular for club and country, and indeed when he was suspended at the end of last season, that’s when Liverpool dropped crucial points.

I saw him play for Sunderland on the right side of midfield and despite lacking killer pace he looked a threat because of the quality of his delivery.

Liverpool have taken him to Anfield and under Rodgers he has become a brilliant midfield player who can control a game, keep the ball and use it with intelligence and quality.

Making the difference: Jordan Henderson has proved to be a key player for both Liverpool and England 

Not bad for a player who was nicknamed ‘Horrendouson’ by some Liverpool fans I know a short time ago.

There are lessons to be learned from what Liverpool have done with Henderson. He’s not the only one to benefit at that club. Just look at Raheem Sterling. Now that is an example of man-management and coaching at its very best.

It was only just over 12 months ago we were wondering which path Sterling would take as he seemed to be at a crossroads. He’s already a brilliant player, imagine what’s still to come from him.

There’s a bigger picture here though. And it explains why some talented youngsters don’t break into top Premier League clubs.

Man in the middle: Henderson has established himself in the England team in recent months 

Take last season’s top four. Liverpool sign English players and make them better, and so do Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City don’t. They are under no obligation to of course, but then that’s part of a big problem for football in England. Some top clubs have no regard whatsoever for English players or the national team.

The situation in Germany is massively different. Bayern Munich is a gigantic club, but within its soul it harbours a desire to remain German, and provide players for the national team. It is a club that hasn’t lost sight of its roots. It’s a club that realizes – unlike so many short-sighted people in England – you can have club AND country, there doesn’t have to be a battle between the two.

Working his magic: Brendan Rodgers has made Henderson into a key player for club and country 

This willingness to work with young talent and make them better - and in some cases get them ready for the England team - is one of the reasons why neutrals warm to Liverpool and Arsenal, and at the same time explains why there is a coldness, almost a dislike of both Chelsea and Manchester City.

The latter two clubs sign big players for big money and the manager picks a team. There is very little individual coaching and development of any players at these clubs. Let me give you an example.

Micah Richards was brilliant as a teenager, but City have presided over the decline of a great talent. I spoke to Richards last week and he sounded energized by his move, but saddened that he had to leave City – he considers them to be ‘his’ club, that’s where he really wanted to make it.

Chelsea had the best player of the Under 17 European Championships in 2010. Josh McEachran ran the show, and led England to victory. He’s gone out for yet another loan spell this season.

Individual players have to take some responsibility of course, but given the talent possessed by Richards and McEachran, both Man City and Chelsea need to take a long hard look at how they do things.

Chelsea’s FA Youth Cup record in recent years is brilliant – they’ve appeared in four of the last five finals and won three of them. However you won’t find many people in football confident that any of these youth players will progress to the first team at Stamford Bridge. Why not?

Winning trophies is the priority of course, but clubs exist for other important reasons too. There are other goals they should set themselves. If a football club can’t coach individual players to fulfill their potential then there is clearly something wrong.

Maybe City and Chelsea should be braver and ask more of their coaches. Maybe both clubs could learn something from Arsenal and Liverpool.
