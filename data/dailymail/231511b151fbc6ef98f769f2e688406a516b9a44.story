The app is so popular is was recently showcased by Apple in one of its TV ads - something unlikely to happen again.

Quest Visual, developer of the app, confirmed the deal today - but refused to say how much Google had paid for it.

'With Word Lens, we've seen the beginnings of what's possible when we harness the power of mobile devices to 'see the world in your language,' it said

'By joining Google, we can incorporate Quest Visual's technology into Google Translate's broad language coverage and translation capabilities in the future.

'As a thank you to everybody who supported us on our journey, we've made both the app and the language packs free to download for a limited time while we transition to Google.

'We're looking forward to continuing our work at Google - stay tuned!'

Developers Quest Visual announced Google's acquisition last month, but didn't disclose how much the deal was worth. The app was recently showcased by Apple in one of its TV adverts (pictured bottom right)

The app supports a variety of languages including Spanish, French, German, Italian and Russian.

'See the world in your language: instantly translate printed words using your built-in video camera, in real time!' the firm boasts.

The app is available on iOS and android - and google's Glass wearable computer.

Google has some image recognition tech with its Goggles app, which can read text and translate it. But in Quest Visual, the company probably sees the potential for enhanced applications targeting language.
