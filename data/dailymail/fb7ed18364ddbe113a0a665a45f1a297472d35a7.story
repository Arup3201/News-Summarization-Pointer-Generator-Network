Leeds United star Adryan took play-acting to another level in Saturday's win against Derby.

The Brazilian went down like a sack of spuds after a tackle from Johnny Russell just after the hour mark  at Elland Road.

Referee Mick Russell dished out a booking to the Rams midfielder, but Adryan's over-the-top reaction didn't help his cause.

The Brazil Under-20 international has been brought in on loan from Flamengo to add some flair to United's midfield,

But it was Adryan's  display off-the-ball that caught the eye during Saturday's Championship clash.

A goal in each half from Mirco Antenucci earned Leeds a 2-0 victory against the league leaders as Neil Redfearn's men got back to winning ways.
