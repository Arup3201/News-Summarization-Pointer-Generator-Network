The mother of a brain-dead pregnant 
Fort Worth woman being kept alive by a ventilator has joined her 
son-in-law's calls to end life support.

Lynne
 Machado says she was shocked to learn her state left the family 
powerless to carry out their daughter Marlise Munoz's wish to never be 
dependent on a ventilator because she is pregnant.

Now Machado is lashing out against a Texas law she says has put her family through ‘pure hell.’

Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness

‘The doctors told us that even if a pregnant woman has a DNR or a living will, the law supersedes that,’ Machado told NBC News.

In Texas, doctors must take all life saving measures to preserve the life of an unborn baby.

That’s even if, as in this case, the fetus is too immature to survive outside the mother.

‘My jaw hit the ground,’ said Machado, who hopes to go before the Texas legislature to petition them to change the law.

It
 was just the beginning of a hellish holiday season for Machado and her 
family, one that began two days before Thanksgiving when Machado’s 
son-in-law Erick Munoz found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor.

Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when Marlise's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period

Normal heartbeat: For now, the baby in Marlise's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term

Happier times: Erick Munoz (right, holding their 1-year-old son Mateo) says his wife Marlise (left) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine. But because she is pregnant, Texas law requires she receive all life saving measures

Erick is a paramedic—as was 
Marlise—and immediately performed CPR, but it was no use. At 14 weeks 
pregnant with their second child, Marlise had been without oxygen for an
 hour.

‘They did a CAT scan and an EEG and there was no brain activity,’ Machado said. ‘She was clinically declared brain dead.

Marlise had suffered what was likely an embolism. She has been unconscious ever since and remains on a ventilator.

Now 18 weeks into her pregnancy, the family has no idea whether the child sustained severe damage while deprived of oxygen.

All they know is that they are powerless over their daughter’s fate or that of the unborn fetus.

'Knowing our daughter is not there, but her body is being kept alive, is hard to see,' Machado told CNN.

Marlise must remain on life support until she miscarries the fetus or until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks.

‘At that point they would decide 
whether to start labor, do a C-section, or see if she could go to 34 or 
36 weeks when the fetus would be full term,’ Machado said.

But
 she and her family are horrified things even got this far. ‘No family 
should have to go through this,’ she said. ‘It’s been pure hell.’

Neither
 Machado nor her son-in-law have looked into hiring a lawyer and Machado
 says it will be about a month before they know what the next step will 
be.

For now, the family is in total agreement.

‘I don't agree with this law,’ Erick Munoz told ABC News as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1-year-old son Mateo.

Erick says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation.

And this isn’t it.

'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders

'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines

‘We
 knew what her wishes were,’ Erick, who found his wife unconscious on 
their kitchen floor and fought in vain to resuscitate her, told WFAA.

Per Texas state law: ‘A person may 
not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter
 from a pregnant patient.’

The
 couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive 
by a machine and hadn’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order.

But that wouldn’t have made a difference.

Texas
 gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother’s wishes even when a 
DNR has been signed, where the state’s form reads, ‘I understand under 
Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as 
pregnant.’

For now, doctors say the baby has a 
normal heartbeat, though it remains unknown how it was affected when 
Marlise’s brain was deprived of oxygen.

‘They
 don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,’ Erick 
told ABC. ‘But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead.’

'They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,' Erick said

'I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead': Though he doesn't agree with the laws, Erick says he's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle
