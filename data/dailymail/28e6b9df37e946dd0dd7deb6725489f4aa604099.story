To those around her Eleanor Holmes was a brilliant schoolgirl and talented musician with everything to live for.

But she was secretly battling inner demons – and the only clue to what was troubling her so deeply came in a haunting song she wrote about a girl’s hidden worries about her looks.

Shortly after writing the song Eleanor, 15, killed herself, tormented by pressures to be thinner and prettier and to get on with all her friends.

Elle Holmes, 15, took her own life after pressures to be thinner and prettier and to get on with her friends

Leigh Holmes (centre) whose teenage daughter Elle (left)  died after a tragic accident has revealed that her daughter had been visiting pro-anorexia websites before her death

The lyrics of the song Mirror, Mirror 
include the lines: ‘Mirror mirror don’t you see, What you show her is 
deadly, You killed that little girl.’

Her family had no idea 
anything  was wrong and say she must have  suddenly felt overwhelmed by 
her worries and snapped.

After her death they discovered that she had 
secretly browsed sick ‘pro-ana’ websites – which promote anorexia and 
bulimia – and had made herself sick after eating and had self-harmed in 
the days before her death on May 26.

Eleanor’s mother Leigh, 40, said
 her daughter had shown ‘no sign’ of depression and was filmed laughing 
in a family video hours before she died.

‘I don’t know why my loved, 
brilliant, popular, talented, funny baby made that decision,’ said Mrs 
Holmes, a teacher at an international school in China. ‘She left no 
note. She said nothing to the little brother she adored. No word to her 
boyfriend, or her close inner circle of friends.

‘There was no 
long-suffering depression, or slow descent into despair. The spiral into
 darkness seemed to occur over just a few short hours as her mind became
 overwhelmed and she simply snapped.’

She added it was only through ‘forensically mining’ her daughter’s computer she discovered her hidden concerns.

‘Her
 secret internet history revealed many of the pressures of modern life, a
 desire to be skinnier, prettier, have different hair. There were secret
 accounts on pro-ana websites,’ she said.

Eleanor was a star student 
with dreams of becoming a child psychologist. She had taken GCSEs a year
 early, was captain of her school’s swimming, netball and football 
teams, played three instruments and had volunteered helping orphans in 
Tanzania.

She wrote and performed her own songs, often accompanied on
 the drums by brother Oliver, 13. Among them was Mirror, Mirror. On the 
night of her death, Eleanor – who was also known as Elle – received 
texts with a Gothic-style image of skulls and nooses from a friend and 
sent texts asking whether another friend whom she had fallen out with 
had ‘given up on her’.

Mrs Holmes said: ‘Elle appears to have started
 becoming distressed and began texting a friend, a blameless young 
artist who also was exploring her own demons, who could not have known 
the state of mind Elle was in from such short digital messages, carrying
 none of the nuance or body language of a real conversation.

‘We can
 only imagine what dark tunnels Elle’s mind took her down from there 
onwards, but roughly two hours later, my wonderful baby died – leaving 
me heartbroken.’

Elle loved to sing and recorded a track called Mirror Mirorr which the family hopes will become a world wide hit

Elle Holmes, from Bootle, Merseyside, had also been self-harming, covering her injuries with chunky accessories, her mother revealed. She was in Beijing at the time of her death

Before she died in May, Elle recorded a song that Ms Holmes now wants to share to bring hope to other youngsters struggling across the world and raise funds for teens in crisis

Mrs Holmes added: ‘Elle was a dream child: funny, 
mischievous, caring about her family, committed and openly loving to her
 mum and her little brother. But, clearly, she did have hidden demons.

‘If this could happen to my kid, it could happen to anyone.’

The
 family live in China because Mrs Holmes works at the British School of 
Beijing but are originally from Bootle, Liverpool. A Chinese inquest 
found the cause of death to be asphyxiation.

Mrs Holmes is now in 
talks with singer Anita Prime from New Zealand to record a version of 
Mirror, Mirror to help support girls struggling with their body image.

The record will raise money for teenage mental health charity Papyrus.

Family 
friend Sheree Brown wrote a blog warning parents of the dangers of 
technology, especially in teenagers’ rooms at night.

She said: ‘Mobile 
devices and the such allow too much into what should be their “safe 
place”.’
