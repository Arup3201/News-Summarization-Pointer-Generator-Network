Anonymous street artist Banksy caused a flurry of excitement on the streets of Bristol when his subversive and politically satirical graffiti began cropping up all over his hometown in the mid-1990s.

And now a pseudonymous female urban painter who operates under than name Bambi is set to do the same in London.

Dubbed 'the female Banksy' (even by BBC commentator David Dimbleby), Bambi is a Hoxton-born St. Martin's Art College graduate who has been adding illicit colour to the capital for the past seven years, daubing the city's outside spaces with playful pop culture references and the recognisable faces of Mo Farah, the Queen, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Amy Winehouse.

Furthermore, celebrities including Adele and Rhianna have commissioned her work, while Brad Pitt bought one of her reworkings of Prince William and Kate Middleton's official engagement photo (not the one on an Islington external wall, one assumes) as a gift for Angelina Jolie.

Robbie Williams, Mark Owen, Harry Styles and Louis Walsh also have original Bambis, which sell for sums between £30,000 and £100,000.

Speaking about her art, Bambi, who has never been identified, says: 'I let my work speak for itself. But dreams can inspire me and I am particularly interested in people who spread love and joy.'

So named because her father's 
childhood nickname for her was 'Bambino', Bambi's most famous work is 
arguably her tribute to late singer Amy Winehouse, painted near the home
in which the troubled Camden star died.

The painting was whitewashed only to 
be repainted slightly differently by the artist. The image, titled Amy 
Jade, is now protected by Perspex and considered something of a modern 
cultural landmark.

Bambi told Grazia that her bold and brightly coloured stencillled and freehand work is inspired by artists including Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, and would have liked Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury and Jimi Hendrix to have hung her creations on their walls.

The artist's techniques include spray-paint, diamond dust and gold leaf, and her subject matter is predominantly topical. In 2011 she commemorated the Royal Wedding with a picture of Kate and William, draped in bunting, with 'A Bit Like Marmite' printed across their chests. During the 2012 London Olympic Games she painted a bright yellow likeness of Mo Farah doing the Mobot.

Other subjects include Dita Von Teese, Daniel Craig, Husain Bolt, Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and David Beckham.

Bambi held her first official exhibition at Walton Fine Arts Gallery in Knightsbridge last November, the company being her exclusive agents.

But when you're not told where her art is, can you find one in the city?
