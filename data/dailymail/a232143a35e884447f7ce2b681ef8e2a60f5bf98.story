A debate in the House of Lords is the last place you expect to hear someone fantasise about making love to George Clooney. But it is precisely what cheeky typist-turned-Tory Minister Tina Stowell did when she persuaded fuddy-duddy peers to back gay marriage laws.

Lords Leader Baroness Stowell used Clooney to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman, not a man.

For example, she told dumbstruck peers, if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her – ‘and who could blame him?’ she added coyly – Clooney’s ‘husband’ could sue him for adultery with her.

Crush: Baroness Stowell, who referred to George Clooney in a debate, with a cardboard cut-out of the actor

Sure enough, a photo of Stowell alongside a life-sized cardboard cut- out of the star has pride of place in her tennis court-sized, red leather and wood-panelled Lords office, where we chatted. ‘I’ve had a soft spot for him ever since I saw him in ER,’ she says. ‘I needed to relax peers who were tense about gay marriage, so I thought, “I’ll bring in George Clooney.” ’

And fantasise about having sex with him? ‘A bit of humour helps,’ she smiles.

Stowell is to extend the gay marriage laws in the next few weeks, allowing gay people who took part in civil partnerships before gay marriage was legalised to ‘upgrade’ it into a formal marriage.

‘It’s important for them to say not “I’m sort of married” but that they are married,’ she says.

When Stowell was made Lords Leader – a Cabinet Minister in all but name – in July, some grandees were appalled, even more than when she was ennobled three years ago.

They reacted with the same haughty disdain that Downton Abbey’s Earl of Grantham showed sparky kitchen maid Daisy on learning she was studying maths instead of washing dishes.

‘Tina should be pushing the tea trolley at Cabinet, not sitting at the table,’ scoffed one, a reference to her having been PA to John Major and William Hague.

In truth, ‘the Earl of Downing Street’ David Cameron had exposed her to such insults by denying Stowell full-blown Cabinet status – and £22,000 extra pay – given to her predecessor. Stowell, 5ft 1in, faced a revolt led by Baroness Betty Boothroyd, who accused the PM of ‘trampling on the constitution’.

Didn’t little Tina feel cowed by all these people fulminating at her?

‘I don’t feel intimidated by anybody. I was brought up to believe I’m as good as anyone else.’ Spoken like Daisy.

Stowell's doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause 

Stowell, 47, whose dad Dave was a painter and decorator and mum Margaret worked in a factory in the same street as their terrace house in Beeston, Nottinghamshire (‘it was posh, we had an inside loo’, she laughs) left her local comp aged 16 with five O-levels. She showed her gritty determination aged 14, landing a weekend job at a cake shop.

‘They said I couldn’t work out front until I knew the price of all 100 cakes,’ she says. ‘When I went back the next week, they couldn’t believe I knew them all.’

How much was a doughnut? ‘12p,’ she answers. ‘If I saw a big queue outside I’d try my hardest to get it down and it brought a big smile to my face when I did.’

Doesn’t it require loftier thinking to be a Cabinet Minister?

She swats it away like a fly on a sticky bun. ‘The Lords may seem a million miles from the cake shop, but those people in the queue are who I think of when I do my job here,’ she says.

Her cool confidence and prim porcelain glamour is a far cry from the unworldly lass mistaken for a hooker when, aged 18, she was dropped off by mum and dad at a hostel in London, for her first Civil Service job as a secretary. ‘I was stopped by a bloke who said “Are you looking for business?” I said “Sorry?” I didn’t know what he was on about. When I told the girls in the hostel, they said “Didn’t you know? This a red light area”.’

Her horizons widened with a stint at the British Embassy in Washington, and she joined Downing Street when John Major was Prime Minister. She recalls her rage when she overheard a plummy-voiced Tory sneer at ‘ignorant’ Major, unaware his loyal PA was listening. ‘The very things people criticised him for like his humble background are why I admired him. I don’t like snobs,’ she says. She formed the same bond with the next Tory leader William Hague, adding: ‘When he stepped down, I sobbed my heart out.’

But there were tears of joy when, a decade later, now a Minister with her own PA, she piloted the gay marriage laws through the Lords. ‘I was choked with happiness,’ she says.

Baroness Stowell told dumbstruck peers that if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her, Clooney's 'husband' could sue him for adultery with her

First she had to persuade crusty peers to take notice of someone who had never been married herself.

Again she deployed her ‘friend’ George Clooney, telling the Lords bold as brass in her broad Nottinghamshire accent: ‘I’m single but as long as George Clooney is available I’m prepared to wait.’ Even peers who raged about the ‘evils of buggery’ softened.

Stowell’s doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause. That was a year ago. Clooney is married now. ‘It’s his loss, there you go, no more excuses,’ she grins.

She has never been short of male admirers, so why no marriage? ‘No one ever asked me!’

You have to go looking.

‘Maybe I’ll start.’

Mmm. Perhaps it is the price she has paid for her career?

‘No,’ she says firmly, ‘I don’t rule it out, though I’m probably past having children. Mum drilled it into me never to be financially dependent on a man, get a job, fend for yourself.’

The gay marriage law made her a gay icon, leading to awards from Pink News and Spectator magazine. Stowell’s, dare I say it, rather raunchy, pixie-like Twitter photo has a hint of the Judy Garland in it. She is dolled up, albeit on a budget. Her black and berry Precis Petite jacket is £79 from the suitably conservative House of Fraser.

Some gay rights campaigners have speculated whether petite Stowell is gay? ‘Oh really?’ she replied.

Is she? ‘No,’ she says, her bright blue bush baby eyes gleaming.

And she is again quick to scotch any idea that she may never marry. ‘If a fantastic guy turned up and offered me a life better than the one I have now, why would I say no?’ she says. ‘Now George Clooney is taken, I’m back on the market.’
