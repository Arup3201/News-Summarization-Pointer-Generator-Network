Two Orthodox rabbis have been arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap and beat Jewish men - using cattle prods and karate moves - so that they would divorce their wives.

Mendel Epstein and Martin Wolmark were arrested following a sting operation with an undercover agent posing as unhappily married woman in New Jersey, the FBI announced on Thursday.

Orthodox rules allow only a man to initiate a divorce, but the rabbis allegedly told the woman they would torture her husband into agreeing to one - if she paid tens of thousands of dollars.

Accused: Rabbi Mendel Epstein, pictured, was arrested with another rabbi and two other men for allegedly offering to kidnap and torture husbands so they'd grant their wives divorces

They allegedly said they would use 
electric cattle prods, karate and handcuffs and put plastic bags over 
the heads of reluctant husbands, and found warehouses to hold the men 
hostage.

The men allegedly told the agent that they carried out similar jobs every 18 months in the community.

Sources
 told WCBS that the alleged scheme has been in place for as long as 20 
years, and 1010 WINS reported that there have been more than a dozen 
kidnappings tied to it.

In 
August, the rabbis allegedly met to authorize the plot, telling the 
woman they wanted $10,000 for the kidnapping and between $50,000 to 
$60,000 to pay a 'tough guy' to carry out the beatings.

In Jewish law, in order to be granted a
 religious divorce, a husband must provide his wife with a document 
known as a 'get'. Only a husband can initiate divorce by issuing the 
'get'.

Probe: An FBI agent stands guard as evidence sits in the trunk of a vehicle at the Brooklyn residence of Rabbi Mendel Epstein during an investigation early Thursday morning following his arrest

Seized: Several defendants, including Epstein and another rabbi, (none pictured) were arrested in an overnight sting

After the agent 
contacted Wolmark, he allegedly said in a recorded phone call: 'You have
 to, we have to, convene a special beth din and see if there are grounds
 to, to, to coerce him on the "get".'

He said that she needed to make sure he could get to New York, where someone could harass him.

A week later, the agents met with Epstein in New Jersey and he talked about kidnapping and torturing the husbands.

'Basically
 what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours
 and beating him up and torturing him and then getting him to give the 
"get",' Epstein allegedly said.

'I
 guarantee you that if you’re in the van, you’d give a "get" to your 
wife. You probably love your wife, but you’d give a "get" when they 
finish with you.'

Two other 
men, Ariel Potash and another known as 'Yaakov', have also been charged 
in the plot after they allegedly assisted the rabbis in obtaining the 
divorces, authorities said.

Investigation: FBI agents remove evidence from the Epstein's home. Their probe has taken two years

Shock: Sources said that the rabbis have provided the 'service' for as long as twenty years

The rabbis are expected to appear in federal court in Trenton on Thursday.

A total of ten people have been taken into custody in connection with case, 1010 WINS reported.

The
 arrests come after a lengthy investigation that started more than two 
years ago in the ultra-Orthodox community in Lakewood, New Jersey.

The investigation was carried out in Ocean and Middlesex counties in New Jersey and Rockland County in New York.

On
 Wednesday night, FBI agents were seen carrying out raids on a Brooklyn 
home and a yeshiva in Monsey, New York in connection with the 
investigation.  

The charges against the men include plotting to kidnap, abduct, hold for ransom and threaten to 'coerce a man to conduct a divorce'.
