Remi Ray, 28, from London

The founder of Plus-Size Fashion Weekend has spoken out about her passion for fashion and how confidence in school helped her achieve her dreams.

Remi Ray, 28, from London, started working in curvy fashion in 2010 and since coming on leaps and bounds she's now been shortlisted for a Cosmopolitan Body Confidence Award. 

The size 16 fashion school graduate believes all women should be allowed to feel beautiful, no matter what their shape or size.

In 2010, while she was in her third year studying fashion business at the London College of Fashion, she launched her popular blog, Trapped in A Skinny World, for women who often feel alienated by high-street stores.

Remi faced her own potential hurdles growing up, but a strong support system meant she was always confident in her body image, business aspirations, and her love life.

'I was always bigger than all my friends,' she says.

'But when, as a teenager, I realised I wasn't like everyone else, I actually embraced it and found things that worked for my shape. I didn't have the usual problems that you hear of like bullying. I was always quite creative and fashion was always going to be my forte. I could lean on that when I was younger. 

'I had a strong representation of people who were like me around me from a young age. My mum wasn't very slim but was always confident and creative - I didn't come from a family of stick thin people.

'It just means my way of shopping if different from all my friends. I might have to do more digging or go to different shops, I know loads of people who struggle in those areas. 

'When I was working in River Island and was a size 16, even a size 14 was hardly stocked I had to wear men's jeans because it was so hard to get high quantities of bigger sizes - and that was only nine years ago.

'Now, though, you can go into a store much more easily to pick up a size 16 or 18 - bigger sizes are more readily available.'

She may have had abundant self-confidence, but she couldn't say the same for opportunities.

'I struggled to get a job after university.

'But my final dissertation was on the plus-size concept, and I realised there wasn't a lot for plus-size women who love fashion... so Trapped In A Skinny World, and three years later, Plus-Size Fashion Weekend, naturally came about.

'I funded [PSFW] through my savings for my Masters through work in retail, such as River Island and Russell & Bromley, and charity work.

'The first one was held in Shoreditch Town hall, then The Vinopolis.'

Plus-Size weekend is a big step forward for fashion week

The second annual show focussed on fashion for size 14 and up

Remi started British Plus-Size Fashion Weekend to counteract the shows which snub size 16-plus women - even though they make up a quarter of high street shoppers.

This year's show saw her attend wearing a T-shirt declaring Fat Is The New Black. It was supported by Evans which, Remi says, was a particularly proud moment.

'It solidified that we're doing something special,' she says.

'Even if just one person gains more confidence as a result of Plus-Size Fashion Weekend, I will have done my job.'

'Remi joined us as a panellist when we launched the first student design competition CUT for Evans and helped us select the winning designs,' says Tom Doran, of Evans.

'Her passion and desire to change attitudes saw us working closely with Remi while she organised the second British Plus-Size Fashion Weekend and she's proved to be a force to be reckoned with. 

'On the day of the actual show her slogan tee said it all. Remi is confident and passionate and strives to give bigger girls the voice they deserve and the fashion they crave.'

This year, Remi launched an 8-piece capsule fashion range, carefully created to suit the needs of larger women. Hayley Hasselhoff is already leading her celebrity fan base.

Available on littleblackdress.com, From London With Love consists of simple dresses with modern accents like fringing and leatherette, coming in at £150-£220.

Her iconic Fat Is The New Black T-shorts cost £25. 

Remi's market research showed her the numbers on a clothing tag actually hold women back form shopping, so she's ditched the sizing system.

'It makes them think 'Oh, it's a 20. I don't want to wear a size 20!' she says. 

'So while my clothes go from size 14-26, I don't do size labels.

'I've taken into account all the things plus-size women consider when shopping,' she says. 

'For a start, they actually fit, and I've done away with traditional size labels - we have letters instead. I'm hoping it might help break down barriers.'

Next year, Remi's remit is expanding to cover all niche markets - petite, plus-size and tall - to make her body-confidence mission even more inclusive

She is also launching her first pop up shop in February. 

The PSFW event brings together retailers, designers and consumers of fashion

Remi's passion for fashion first saw her customising clothes for friends and family aged just 14.

'It's been incredibly hard work, but I'm always left with an amazing feeling knowing that I put blood, sweat and tears into producing a brand I'm completely proud of,' she says.

The volume of new plus-size lines coming out thick and fast from High Street and designer retailers alike have Remi excited for the future of curvy fashion.

'It's a new niche that's busting out the seams - the plus-size fashion world is moving leaps and bounds.

'Missguided's new plus-size range is key because their target audience crosses over multiple fashion-conscious demographics.

'Evans' CUT range is very different and quirky and worlds away from what Evans is thought to provide; just basics and staples.' 

But Remi doesn't think it always works, and  companies should work hard to understand a plus-size shape. 

'I don't really see [Kelly Brook, who created a collection for plus-size retailer Simpy Be) as a plus-size person - she's a 12-14, and plus-size is at least 14-16... Kelly's on the smaller end.

'[Unlike most plus-size women] she would probably be able to say that she can easily find clothes in "normal" shops... 

'There's a lot of collaborations going on. They're not all going to work.'

She's also passionate about bringing in fit models when deisgning a plus-szie range - rather than just grade up from a small pattern block.

'Mass fashion, though, can really get it wrong sometimes. It's good to stick to quality staples... 

'Many of the plus size companies who have been in the business for a long period of time can go back to the drawing board. 

'It's important to use better fit models who are a better representation of their customer. A lot of plus size people are busty. It's important to bring in fit models. You cant be grading from a size 6 to 24.' 

For Remi's new fashion line she cut her clothes on a plus size model who wears size 14-16 and is 'quite busty'.

The Cosmopolitan Ultimate Women Awards 2014 with Baileys, hosted by Fearne Cotton, is at One Mayfair, on December 3, celebrating the nation's truly inspirational real-life women and ultimate celebrities. Remi is in the top 3 runners up for the Body Confidence Award.

Fearne will be joined by judges Jameela Jamil, Millie Mackintosh, Danny O'Donoghue, Baroness Karen Brady, Dr Linda Papadopoulos and Louise Court, Editor-in-Chief of Cosmopolitan magazine.  

The event uses only non-skinny models and has been running for two seasons so far
