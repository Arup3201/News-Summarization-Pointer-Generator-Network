A seven-year-old girl may have been blinded in one eye by stone-throwing in the playground - only months after a report highlighted aggressive behaviour as a problem.

Staff failed to notice that Hajrah Shabir's cornea had been ruptured after she was hit by a stone thrown by children at school.

Despite telling teachers she was in a lot of pain, staff did not realise the seriousness of her injury and told her to wash her eye with water.

Hajrah may never see again in her right eye after the stone-throwing incident in the school playground

It took 90 minutes before Hajrah's parents, Zaida, 46, and Mohammed, 54, were notified of their daughter's injury and her mother immediately came to collect her.

Zaida, a qualified nurse, quickly realised her daughter was blinded in one eye and immediately took her to A&E.

She was transferred to Manchester’s Royal Eye Hospital for surgery and she now waits to see if she will regain her sight.

Hajrah's parents are furious with the response of struggling Cravenwood Primary in Crumpsall, north Manchester,following their daughter's injury.

Quoted in Manchester Evening News, Zaida said their reaction was 'inadequate'.

She told the paper her daughter's cornea had been ruptured and she needed five stitches to repair it.

There have also been complications with a cataract, meaning the family do not know if Hajrah will regain her sight.

Only two months ago, OFSTED inspectors published a report which highlighted that aggressive behaviour in the playground needed to be addressed.

The report states: 'Behaviour is poor in the playground. There is too much name calling and aggressive behaviour.'

Inspectors found the school to be 'inadequate' in all four of the areas observed, including 'quality of teaching' and 'behaviour and safety of pupils'.

The report also said some pupils are 'too boisterous' and 'there is not enough play equipment so pupils no have have enough to do'.

OFSTED advised in January that the school, which has been placed in 'special measures', ensures the safety and behaviour of all pupils by developing a new policy to promote good behaviour-developing opportunities... 'and supervision at lunchtimes eradicating prejudice-based name calling, swearing and bullying'.

Zaida said: 'This is not the first time I’ve heard of stones being thrown and yet nothing’s been done about it. But there are some real problems with behaviour and I think there is a safety risk to all pupils.'

It is not believed Hajrah was deliberately targetted in the incident.

No one was available at the school to comment on the claims. However, quoted in the Manchester Evening News, Hatim Kapacee, the school’s executive head, said staff acted as soon as they realised the seriousness of the injury.

'First aid was administered immediately but at that stage there was no sign of visible injury. Her eye was checked again 20 minutes later by another first aider, and staff called her mum to come and collect her,' he said.

He said the incident was the result of boys throwing pieces of mosaic that had become loose in the playground. He said one piece hit Hajrah after ricocheting off a wall.

The mosaic has now been removed, and the boys and their parents have been spoken to and understand the serious consequences of their game, he said.
