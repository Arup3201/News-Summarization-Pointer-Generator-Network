Denmark's Morten Orum Madsen shot a hole-in-one in a remarkable eagle-eagle finish to claim a share of the lead at the Tshwane Open in South Africa.

England's David Horsey matched his seven-under-par 63 to join him at the top of the leaderboard after the first round at Pretoria Country Club.

Australian Brett Rumford, playing on invitation, and South Africa's Wallie Coetsee were in a tie for third on six under.

Morten Orum Madsen shot hole-in-one on his 17th hole and then an eagle for a shared lead in Pretoria

The dramatic close to Madsen's round captured the most attention. The 26-year-old's ace on the eighth - his 17th - was the 20th on the European Tour already this season and he followed up by taking three at the par-five ninth.

Madsen, who was third at the Africa Open last week, said: 'The last couple of weeks I've been hitting some shots really close and I actually said to my caddy last week that a hole-in-one is on the cards pretty soon.

'Luckily for me it came today. I hit a fantastic shot, I couldn't hit it better, and it spun back into the hole. That was only my second hole-in-one and it's really special to have one in competition on The European Tour.'

Englishman David Horsey played a more steady round than his rival, with seven birdies and no bogeys

Horsey played a more steady round, carding seven birdies in a bogey-free performance.

Coetsee's 64 was notable for his chipping in for eagle at 12th and for one of his five birdies at the 17th.

France's Raphael Jacquelin was one of four players on five under while last week's winner Trevor Fisher Jnr was among 10 a shot further back after a 66. Defending champion Ross Fisher was six shots off the lead on one under.

Australian Brett Rumford, playing on invitation, was on a tie for third with Wallie Coetsee on six under
