Christopher Adjei, 29, was charged with attempted rape and had been about to go before a judge when he escaped from police

A suspected rapist has escaped from custody minutes before he was due to appear before a court.

Christopher Adjei, 29, from Ramsgate, Kent was charged with attempted rape after a girl in her early 20s was attacked in the early hours of June 14, but managed to escape.

Adjei was charged with rape on July 31 and had been bailed to appear in court on Monday.

His hearing had started at Canterbury Crown Court, but just minutes before he was due to appear before the judge, Adjei escaped and is now on the run.

Police are warning anyone who spots Adjei not to approach him, but to contact police instead.

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Jon Holl, from Kent Police, said: 'While his case was being heard on Monday, Adjei left Canterbury Crown Court.

'Kent Police was notified and began a search of the area to locate him. A warrant was issued by the court for his arrest.

'Adjei is described as a stocky black man, with dark hair. We are appealing to Adjei or any of his family members or friends who may know his whereabouts to contact us.'

Kent Police can be contacted on 01227 868032, quoting incident 18-993, or CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111

Adjei's hearing at Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) was already underway when he disappeared, just moments before he was due to appear before the judge
