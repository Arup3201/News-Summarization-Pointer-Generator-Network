It has been confirmed that Iranian jets opened fire on an unmanned U.S.drone last week raising fresh concerns within the Obama administration about Iranian military aggression.

A Predator drone operating off the coast of Kuwait, in international waters, was fired upon by two Su-25 Iranian fighter planes said George Little, the Pentagon press secretary.

The incident occurred on November 1st at 4.15 a.m. eastern time and wasn't revealed publicly because the drone was on a classified mission.

The fighter jets unleashed rocket fire at the drone according to Mr. Little but the Predator was not hit - although the Pentagon's believes the volley was not meant as warning shots.

'Our working assumption is they fired to take it down,' said Mr. Little to the Wall Street Journal.

Two U.S. officials speaking to CNN explained the jets were part of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps force, which has been more confrontational than regular Iranian military forces.

The MQ-1 Predator drone which was flying
 16 miles off the coast captured the incident on its still and 
video cameras which according to officials show the two SU-25s flying 
towards the Predator firing their on-board guns.

Initially, U.S. military intelligence
 analysts were not sure if the Iranian pilots were unable to hit the 
drone out of lack of skill or whether they missed on purpose.

Talking earlier, one unnamed source said, 'It doesn't matter, they fired on us.'

Speaking
 to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Little said that after being fired 
upon, the drone flew out to sea and then made back to its base in 
Kuwait.

He added that this was the first time
 that the Iranians had fired at a U.S. drone and that the United States 
has protested the incident but has not heard back from Iran.

The
 Obama administration did not disclose the incident immediately, which 
occurred five days before the election, but the attack has been 
confirmed today.

Defence officials said politics played no part in keeping the incident quiet.

During
 the presidential debates, the two candidates went to great lengths to 
explain their differing postures regarding their Iranian policy.

Mitt Romney frequently frequently accused President Obama of taking a soft line towards Iran.

'Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability,' said Romney during the campaign.

'And it has never acted less deterred by America.'

The
 President however has preferred to stick with sanctions against Iran, 
but in a speech to the United Nations on Sept. 25, he repeated his 
position that the United States would work to prevent Iran from gaining 
nuclear weapons. 

The Iranians have previous with American military spy drones.

In December last year, the Islamic Republic claimed to have shot down one of the United States most sophisticated spy planes - the stealth RQ-170 Sentinel drone.

The Iranian military paraded the craft in a public gym as the American's denied the unammned plane had indeed been shot down.

surveillance mission last December 

According to Little, the U.S. drone was conducting 'routine surveillance' and that the Iranian jets tried twice to shoot down the craft.

Asked about how the U.S. could respond, he said: 'We have a wide range of options from diplomatic to military.'

He would not be draw on whether they were actually plans for a military response and refused to be drawn into speculation around the attack being considered an act of war.

The Pentagon announced the brazen attack as the Obama administration imposed another round of sanctions on Iranian officials and entities.

They are the first sanctions since President Obama's re-lection on Tuesday and according to the Treasury Department are 'related to the Iranian government's human rights abuses, its support of terrorism and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.'

'This is the first time a UAV has been fired upon by an Iranian aircraft,' Little said, using the abbreviation for unmanned aerial vehicle. 'The United States has communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to do surveillance flights over international waters over the Arabian Gulf.'

The United States conveyed the message through Swiss diplomats, who have represented U.S. interests in Tehran since Washington broke off diplomatic relations.

U.S. President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney had differing views about how to deal with Iranian nuclear ambitions
