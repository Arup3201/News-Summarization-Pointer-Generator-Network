His baby blue eyes and chiseled jawline won't do him much good where he's going.

Jeremy Meeks, also known as the 'hot felon,' was sentenced to more than two years in prison Thursday morning, CBS reports. 

Meeks was convicted, in federal court, of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. 

The judge sentenced him to 27 months in prison and 500 hours in the Bureau of Prisons Substance Abuse Treatment Program, according to CBS.

Pout: Meeks, 30, pouted in court in July when he learned that his case had been taken over by federal prosecutors

Many wondered what the convict was up to after gaining thousands of admirers on social media once the Stockton, Calif. Police Department posted the 30-year-old's mugshot to their Facebook page. 

Police arrested Meeks in June of last year on felony weapon charges.

The photo went viral with thousands swooning over Meeks' baby blues and model-esque features. The photo was posted on multiple social media sites like Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr.

Nicknames: His criminally handsome mugshot inspired memes (photographed) and earned Meeks nicknames like 'Hotty McMug Shot' and 'Mugshot McDreamy.'

The original Facebook post has since amassed more than 101,000 'likes' and more than 12,000 shares.

His criminally handsome mugshot earned him nicknames like 'Hotty McMug Shot' and 'Mugshot McDreamy.' The photo even inspired hashtags like #FelonCrushFriday.

Many swooned over the viral sensation, ignoring his lengthy rap sheet that spans more than 10 years including grand larceny, identity theft, and more -- so much more.

The judge wasn't so forgiving.

'Mugshot McDreamy' will spend the next two years in the big house where he won't be getting much female attention.

The judge also ordered Meeks to pay a $100 but found that the convict does not have the ability to pay it, CBS reports.

It will be a long time before Meeks, who reportedly earned a modeling contract with a Santa Monica-based agency, will be posing in a photo-shoot. 

His next photograph will be a mugshot in federal prison.
