A rotund opera singer has lost an impressive five stone and is in training to complete a 300 mile charity cycle after adopting a caveman diet .

David Webb also  took up Cross Fit, the new fitness phenomenon involving constantly varied, high intensity workouts, and went from an unhealthy 19 stone and 40 per cent body fat to a fit and muscular 13 stone.

Part of the successful opera group Amore, David has performed across the globe, on multiple TV shows and even serenaded the Queen on the royal barge at her jubilee, but his confidence on stage has hidden a lifelong struggle with his weight.

David, pictured second right with Amore members (l-r) Peter Brathwaite, Monica McGhee and Victoria Gray, knew he had to loose weight to be fit for singing

The 29-year-old, who trained at the Royal College of Music, says although he was always large, he was very active as a child.

‘I was never taught about food as a child. I was never told how exactly people got fat.’

David, who played rugby and football throughout his childhood, says he began to over eat when his parents got divorced.

‘A lot of it was eating to comfort myself,’ admits David, who also suffered bullying at school because of his size.

‘I’d eat so much I would almost be sick, then start all over again. I’d hate myself for doing it’ he says.

However, his high level of activity meant that David remained reasonably fit, and aged 18, he was able to run the London Marathon for his little sister Hannah, who was wheelchair bound throughout her childhood with ME.

David was active in his childhood, but the weight still crept on due to his diet, especially during his gap years

‘I spoke to Hannah about what it was like, about feeling each movement was a monumental effort and being trapped. It sounded a bit like ‘hitting the wall’ in a marathon.

‘I thought, if I can do the race, it’s just a tiny bit of what she goes through everyday.’

Despite completing this extreme physical feat David says the weight continued to pile on during his gap years, when he was singing in the Truro Cathedral choir.

Amore's success has seen them appear on numerous TV shows like ITV's Daybreak. David explains that even in opera 'you have to look as good as you sound nowadays'

David adopted the Caveman diet of basic, natural and largely unprocessed foods to get so svelte, though he still allows himself a 'fatterday' each week

Working in a bakery in the day, David would start eating at the very start of the day, enjoying the pastries and breakfast foods the bistro served.

‘I could eat two walnut and maple pastries, then scrambled eggs with four or five slices of buttered toast just for breakfast.’

‘It was all beige food. Then after I’d sung in the choir we’d head down the pub and I’d have five or six pints.

‘There’s a stereotype of the fat opera singer, but you actually need to be incredibly fit to sing.

‘Nowadays you have to look as good as you sound,’ David explains.

When he started at the Royal college of Music, weighing a hefty 19 stone, David realised if he was to continue to pursue his dream of becoming an opera singer on the global stage he would have to tackle his growing waistline.

He adopted the Palaeolithic diet, often called the cave man diet, based on foods that might have been eaten by out hunter gatherer ancestors.

David's diet shifted from high fat and sugar foods to natural unprocessed foods, with lots of protein.

A typical days food became scrambled eggs , smoked mackerel and spinach for breakfast, chicken and steamed broccoli for lunch and a ‘palaeo lasagne’, made without any pasta, for dinner.

In addition David began ‘Crossfit’, a fitness program, founded by Greg Glassman, that is fast growing in popularity, involving high intensity bouts of exercise for short periods, focusing on core strength.

‘Workouts last for about 10-20 minutes each. The idea is to challenge your body so the workouts are constantly changing.

‘A lot of the exercises are functional, so they are designed to actually be helpful in everyday life.’

A session usually involved high impact cardio with weights as well as skill based exercises like working with Olympic rings, handstands, push ups and burpies.

‘Although each session is short, the high intensity means they are exhausting and really challenge your body. I’m often on the floor at the end!’ says David, who began to notice the effects on his body almost immediately.

‘It was incredible. With each month more and more people would comment on my weight loss.

‘But what surprised me was the comments about my attitude, how much more positive I was.’

David and Peter met Harry Styles backstage at this years Brit awards. As Amore's success has continued, so has David's physical transformation

It was during his time at the Royal College that David met fellow Amore members Monica McGhee, Peter Brathwaite and Victoria Gray and formed the group.

As they went from success to success, David’s frame continued to shrink.

Each week he allows himself a day off his diet, which he calls ‘fatterday', where he can eat exactly what he likes.

David, seen here after completing the Men's Health 10km assault course, says the biggest change has been in his attitude and confidence

‘I’m obsessed with Oreo milkshakes so I usually make sure I get one of them in!

‘The feeling of health has over taken the feeling of vanity now, I love feeling physically fit.

‘The confidence I have gained is what motivates me to keep going.  I find I’m craving the bad foods less and less as time goes on.’

‘The only downside is none of my suits fit me anymore!’ he says.

David is now using his new found fitness to raise money for cleft palette charity Operation Smile by cycling 300 miles in three days.

He is hoping to raise £2,400 which is enough for 16 children to have a life-changing operation.

‘In 3 days I will cover over 300 miles, and although it's April, it's most likely that it will be raining for at least two of the three days!

‘I was first introduced to Operation Smile and their work, when 'Amore' were invited to perform at their Christmas Service last year.

The commitment, energy and huge hearts of the staff and volunteers made me want to do something else to raise money and awareness of their work than just sing.

David has pledged that he will cycle all the way home again if he reaches 3 times his original goal.
