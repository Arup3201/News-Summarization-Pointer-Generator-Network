A gypsy couple who have been ordered to demolish their £250,000 'mobile home' because it is 18 inches too wide have opened the doors of the static unit they have lived in for the last eight years.

Rodney Wilson and partner Pat Wenn moved onto the land in Walsoken, Norfolk in 2006 - despite local planning laws which ban building on the site.

In 2011 - after an appeal  - they were eventually granted permission to have two mobile homes which they knocked into a single property, complete with conservatory, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room and dining area.

A gypsy couple who have been ordered to demolish their £250,000 'mobile home' because it is 18 inches too wide. Council chiefs have said the two mobile units joined together were too big at 24ft wide, instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites

Although their home in set in its own two acres of land, back from the main road, the council has told Rodney Wilson that he will have to demolish the excess 18 inches from its dimensions

Now the couple are either faced with a huge bill for the work, or will be forced to tear down their home, which they have spent years making comfortable for their retirement

But they found themselves in another 
battle with West Norfolk Borough Council when it emerged their lavishly appointed double 
park home - which also has a front garden and an ornamental pond - was too 
big and didn't adhere to planning proposals for 'mobile homes'.

Although their home in set in its own two acres of land, back from the main road, the council has told Mr Wilson that he will have to demolish the excess 18 inches from its dimensions.

Now the couple are either faced with a huge bill for the work, or tearing down their home, which they have spent years making comfortable for their retirement.

It
 comes after planners said the two mobile units joined together were 
24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules 
governing caravan sites.

Mr Wilson, who worked as a labourer for his whole life, yesterday said he and his partner have been left devastated by the decision.

He said: 'They just want me to cut the front of my house clean off.

The home has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room and dining area

In 2006, the council refused to accept that the mobile unit was a 'caravan' because it did not pass the necessary mobility tests

The family home - which has been fully furnished - has been the couple's home for eight years

Mr Wilson said: ''I bought this place to stay here but it is a situation where I have tried everything and I have tried to compromise'

'I have worked since I was eight because I believe you have to look after yourself. I saved all my life to buy this place.

'I had decided first of all to cut it down myself but it is going to cost me £38,000 and I've already spent £30,000 on legal costs. I can't afford it.'At the moment we're at a stage where they could come at any time because they have enforced the enforcement.'My MP has never come across anything like this before, neither had the judge and neither has my barrister.'If your face fits then it goes through, but if your face doesn't fit then it won't.

Floor plans for the property show it has a kitchen, lounge three bedrooms, and two bathrooms. But now planners have said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites

'I am sat in two acres of land, I have got no immediate neighbours and I have got conifer trees all around it.

'It will look exactly the same if we cut the front off.'

The battle to keep his home has been a long one for Mr Wilson.

In 2006, the council refused to accept
 that the mobile unit was a 'caravan' because it did not pass the 
necessary mobility tests.

Council
 chiefs also did no believe that Mr Wilson was a gypsy at the beginning 
of the planning process - so the planning decision was not assessed in 
accordance with those used for gypsy sites.

However,
 after hearing additional information about his formerly 'nomadic life' -
 which he lived until he decided to settle down and cease travelling - 
they accepted his status and gave permission for him to build a 'mobile 
home for persons of gypsy status'.

Mr 
 Wilson, and his partner, 75, were refused permission to keep the 
existing home on the site as the council voted for 'direct action' to 
remove it in 2012.

The couple appealed but a High Court 
judge has now lifted an injunction stopping the council from getting rid
 of the property under the original enforcement notice of 2006.

Council chiefs also did no believe that Mr Wilson was a gypsy at the beginning of the planning process - so the planning decision was not assessed in accordance with those used for gypsy sites

A
 report to a recent planning committee meeting said: 'Implementation and
 execution of direct action to comply with part of the enforcement 
notice, the removal of the unauthorised park home, will now be carried 
out to remedy the ongoing breach of planning control.'

Mr Wilson said the threat of demolition is taking its toll on he and his partner's life.

He said: 'My missus is crying all the time and her blood pressure is through the roof because we don't know what day they will just turn up.

'We don't have the amount of money we need to cut it down. All I want is to retire here in peace.

'I bought this place to stay here but it is a situation where I have tried everything and I have tried to compromise.

'If they give me enough time then I could try and sort something out to cut it down.

'If they were to move this and get rid of it then it would cost them £40,000 and they would have to find me accommodation.

'They just sit in their offices and they are just not bothered.'

A spokesman for the council said: 'As the judge has now discharged the injunction, which was in place pending the latest planning appeal to be dismissed, the Council can now implement direct action to rectify the longstanding breach of planning control.'
