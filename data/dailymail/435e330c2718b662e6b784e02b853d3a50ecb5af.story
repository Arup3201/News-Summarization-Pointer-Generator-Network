Arsenal have agreed a £34million deal in principle with Barcelona for Chile international forward Alexis Sanchez but Barcelona are waiting to see if Juventus can match the offer.

Sanchez has indicated he does not want to join Liverpool despite their efforts to persuade him and Brendan Rodgers being keen to speak to the player.

That will mean a straight cash deal for Luis Suarez from Barcelona.
