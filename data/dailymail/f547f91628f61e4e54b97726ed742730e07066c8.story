'Homeland' star Mandy Patinkin got the surprise of his life during his latest appearance on 'Live with Kelly and Michael' when he was brought face to face with not one, but two of his ex-girlfriends.

Last December, the 61-year-old actor, who is married with two kids, went on the popular ABC talk show where he learned that a woman named Sandy Lustig Hyman had sent the hosts an email saying that Patinkin was her first kiss.

'I've been looking for her, she was the greatest! Patinkin exclaimed.

Blast from the past: In December, Mr Patinkin came on the show and was told by the hosts that his grade school girlfriend contacted them and asked to say 'hi' from her to the actor, who was her first kiss

Big reveal: The 61-year-old actor was talking about his plans to see Sandy Lustig Hyman next time he was in Texas when his grade school sweetheart (right) came onto the set

In an episode that aired Wednesday 
morning, Patinkin came back on the show ostensibly to promote his latest
 movie project, but Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan had a big surprise in
 store for their guest.

The pre-taped interview began with the co-hosts asking Patinkin if he had a chance to reach out to his former flame.

The
 'Homeland' star replied that right after the taping of the show last 
December, he called up Sandy and made plans to meet next time he was in 
Texas, prompting Kelly to jokingly point out that his wife of 34 years, 
Kathryn Grody, might get jealous.

'My wife had every one of her exes at our wedding,' Patinkin quipped in reply. 'She cannot complain.'

Long-awaited reunion: Mr Patinkin and Miss Lustig haven't seen one another in 40 years

Picking up where they left off: The two former sweethearts embraced and were delighted to see each other

Sweet memories: Mr Patinkin recalled that he and Sandy had a magic act together

A moment later, Mr Patinkin was overjoyed to encounter his grade school sweetheart, now a grown woman with a son, Sandy Lustig Hyman, who marched onto the set to the delight of the hosts and the audience.

The actor and his ex-girlfriend fell into each other's arms and exchanged a smooch. For several minutes, the happy couple stood hugging, holding hands and chattering excitedly.

During an interview that followed, the childhood lovebirds, sitting next to one another, reminisced about the past and the last time they saw each other, which was 40 years ago.

Lustig and Patinkin first met in kindergarten and remained close friends through high school.

'The Princess Bride' star revealed that he used to do magic shows with another girl named Sandy, while Miss Lustig recalled with a smile how in second grade, Patinkin sent her a birthday invitation where he addressed her as 'honey.' 

Bigger bombshell: In a second surprise of the day, a stunned Mr Patinkin was reunited on the show with his college flame, Lenore Haynes

Jealous type: Mr Patinkin recounted how he helped Haynes and her new boyfriend set up a waterbed, which he jokingly recalled 'almost destroyed' him

Operation 'Lenore': Mr Patinkin said he had asked his friends in the FBI and CIA to help him find his ex-girlfriend

After the break, Miss Lustig took her leave and Patinkin said he had another request for Kelly and Michael: he was now hoping to locate his college girlfriend, Lenore Haynes.

‘I'm 61 years old, you just want to find everybody,’ he explained. 

The prominent TV and Broadway star said that he has exhausted all avenues trying to reconnect with his old flame, even approaching friends in the intelligence community he has made while working on 'Homeland.'.

'I have called my FBI and CIA connections [asking], “Will you hunt her down for me?”’ he said.

The sly Miss Ripa invited their guest to look into the camera and say his ex-girlfriend’s name in hopes that someone might help him find her.

An unaware Mr Patinkin dutifully followed her advice, not knowing that Lenore Haynes herself was making her way onto the set right behind him.

The actor swung around with a look of genuine shock on his face before the two shared an emotional hug and a kiss.

'We were college boyfriend and girlfriend, sweethearts,' an excited Mr Patinkin explained.

The two went to the University of Kansas together in 1970-1971 before Mr Patinkin moved to New York City to attend the prestigious Julliard School.

The happily married actor choked up as he talked about their breakup, describing himself as 'heartsick,' and how he followed Lenore across the country later.

'I helped set up a waterbed for her and her new boyfriend,' Mr Patinkin recalled with a smile. 'It almost destroyed me.'

Going strong: Patinkin and Grody (pictured left and right) have been married for 34 years; on 'Live with Kelly and Michael', the actor revealed that his wife had invited all of her ex-boyfriends to their wedding in 1980

Mrs Haynes, sporting a silver bob and fashionable glasses, said she is married and has three children in their late 20s, one of whom was on hand in the audience to witness his mother's reunion with her former paramour with whom she was 'living in sin,' as Mr Patinkin jokingly remarked.

'I'm not your father, am I?' the actor quipped, addressing Lenore's handsome son in the crowd.

Mr Patinkin, who lives in High Falls, New York, with his family, was delighted to learn that like his grammar school girlfriend, Mrs Haynes also resides in Texas.

'I'm moving!' he exclaimed.

After all the excitement of the two reunions, the Tony-winning and Golden Globe -nominated actor concluded his appearance on the daytime talk show by talking about his voiceover work in the Japanese animated film ‘The Wind Rises,’ which is up for an Academy Award this year.

'Have fun with your exes today!' Mr Strahan cheekily wished their departing guest.
