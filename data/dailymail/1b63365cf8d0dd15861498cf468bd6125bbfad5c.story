Alan Bennett said being touched on his legs by older men when he was a child did not bother him

Alan Bennett has revealed he was ‘touched up by old gentlemen’ as a young boy – but claims it didn’t bother him.

The 78-year-old playwright and author said the incidents happened when he was about ten or 12, and never went any further.

In Bennett’s acclaimed play The History Boys, English teacher Hector is known to fondle some of his pupils while driving them home on his motorbike.

But the character is portrayed sympathetically and the 17-year-old students tolerate his advances.

It now seems Bennett may have been drawing on his own experiences.

He told the Radio Times: ‘When I was young, ten or 12, one often found one’s legs were touched up by old gentlemen, in a mild sort of way.

‘It never got beyond that. I remember thinking, “Oh God, here we go again”.

But it didn’t bother me. I knew it was wrong, but I shouldn’t say anything about it because I knew they would get into trouble.

‘But the notion that one would be scarred for life…’

In his short autobiographical play Cocktail Sticks, which was first shown last year, Bennett revealed he was once ‘interfered with’ in a Leeds cinema by an adult male customer.

But in the Radio Times interview Bennett played the episode down, saying it was ‘in a mild way’.

He also talked about a recent appearance at the National Theatre, when he was asked whether he had considered rewriting The History Boys in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex-abuse scandal.

He said: ‘I just said no. It’s a ridiculous idea that I might rewrite it and I said so, kindly. It was never on the cards.’

Bennett lives in London with his long-term partner, magazine editor Rupert Thomas, 46.
