Wayne Rooney arrived at Manchester United as a better all-round player than Cristiano Ronaldo despite signing a year after the Portuguese star, according to Rio Ferdinand.

The former Everton striker signed in a £27million deal in 2004, with a huge reputation and the potential to become one of the game's next global stars.

Ferdinand claims there was so much excitement when Rooney joined, although Ronaldo has since gone on to dwarf the former's achievements with United and most recently Real Madrid.

Speaking in an exclusive with The Sun, Ferdinand says: 'It's hard to explain just how much excitement there was at Old Trafford when he [Rooney] joined us. He signed a year after Cristiano Ronaldo but Rooney was the better all-round player.

'He was a more mature footballer who could bring the rest of the team into the game and could score and make goals.

'Cristiano was special, too, and his tricks, flicks and dribbles were fantastic. But at the time he did not have the rounded game which Wazza had.'

Rooney and Ronaldo built up a fine partnership on the pitch, but famously clashed at the World Cup in 2006 when the English star was sent off in a quarter-final against Portugal.

Ronaldo was spotted winking at his bench after protesting with the referee, ramping up claims that he helped get the youngster sent off.

But Ferdinand claims the duo made up before leaving the stadium after the game, with Ronaldo worried that the incident was going to affect their relationship.

'He said to me, "Can I talk to Wazza, is he OK?", Ferdinand adds.

'He asked me to go and get him and kept saying, "I didn't try to get him sent off, I really didn't."

'He was worried it was going to affect their relationship at United. I'm not sure what they said to each other but by the time both teams left the ground it was pretty much sorted out between the two of them.'
