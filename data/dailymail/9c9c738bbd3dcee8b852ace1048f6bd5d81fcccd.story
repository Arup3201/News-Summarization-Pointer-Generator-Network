Angry: Mike Harding says all he has done is spend 15 years boosting listener numbers while stars have done bad things and kept their jobs

Mike Harding hit out at BBC bosses yesterday after he was sacked from his popular Radio 2 folk music show after 15 years.

The 67-year-old musician and comedian will be replaced on Wednesday evenings by Mark Radcliffe, 54. 

Harding said he ‘could not understand’ why he had been axed and drew comparisons with disgraced BBC stars who had previously kept their jobs.

He said: ‘Jimmy Savile interfered with kids on the BBC’s premises and got away with it. Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand joked about having sex with Andrew Sachs’s grandaughter on the BBC and got away with it.

‘I present a folk show for 15 years, build the audience from 70,000 to 860,000, and get the sack – and it’s me that’s supposed to be the comedian.

‘They have sold the folk world down the river.’

The presenter said his boss, Bob Shennan, had refused to explain the decision to him.

He said: ‘He [Mr Shennan] said I wasn’t “live” – I wasn’t aware I was dead. I am not bitter, I just don’t understand it. It’s a specialist folk music show and I am a  specialist in folk music.’

Harding said he would continue to ‘present the music I love’ until December 26.

On Twitter he added: ‘That’s me gone – but remember, I didn’t jump, I was pushed.’

Harding said: 'I'm in the dark and 
have no idea why they have done it.

Shame: Harding also cited claims Sir Jimmy Savile abused people on BBC premises but worked for the corporation for decades

'You get sacked from the BBC for two 
reasons. One, financial - and it can't be that because I've not had a 
rise in 15 years. And two, declining audience figures - and mine 
haven't. They have sold the folk world down the river.'

Mr
Shennan said: 'I'd like to thank Mike Harding, who has spent 15 years 
at the top of his game, delighting fans with his expertise and rooting 
out the very best folk music.

'On his watch, folk has enjoyed a huge 
surge in popularity and Mike has been key in supporting the genre and 
introducing Radio 2 listeners to a broad range of new artists.

'We very 
much hope to work with him again in the future.'
