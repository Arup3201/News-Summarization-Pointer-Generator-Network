West Ham have made enquiries about Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid.

The 25-year-old centre-back has spent the last two years at Leverkusen, and played 24 times last season for the German side, who finished fourth in the Bundesliga.

Earlier in the summer, Leverkusen confirmed they would be willing to listen to offers for the German defender, and the Hammers are poised to make a move. 

Target: West Ham have made enquiries about Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid

Wollscheid, an imposing defender at 6ft 3in, has two caps for the German national side.

The central defender had been attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs in the past few weeks, with Hull and Southampton both looking at the player over the summer.

But both clubs have turned their attention elsewhere - Hull are close to signing Michael Dawson from Tottenham, and the Saints have made a move for Atletico Madrid defender Toby Alderweireld. 

Alternative: Southampton were looking at Wollscheid but are now targeting Toby Alderweireld (left)

On his way? West Ham boss Sam Allardyce hopes Wollscheid will join West Ham and strengthen their defence
