Under threat: Charity Plantlife says wildlife habitats are being destroyed by councils incessantly mowing down and trimming grass verges

Valuable wildlife habitats are being destroyed by councils incessantly mowing down and trimming grass verges in the UK, a charity has warned.

Plantlife is calling for better management of the 600,000 acres of roadside verges across the country, which it says should be treated as hay meadows and only cut twice a year.

The verges support up to 1,000 plant species including the rare bastard balm and long-leaved helleborine which are among 33 wayside flowers facing extinction.

Wildflowers found in such verges are also a vital food source for bees and butterflies which have seen a significant decline in numbers in recent years.

The obsessive cutting down of the verges over the spring and summer by highway authorities and councils - driven by a desire for tidiness - has resulted in the destruction of thousands of miles of colourful and important habitats, according to Plantlife.

The charity says that stopping the mowing down of roadsides when plants are in flower could result in a massive boost for the UK’s wild flowers, bees, butterflies and other insects.

Dr Trevor Dines from Plantlife said: ‘It is almost ironic that the way we manage our road verges now encourages coarse and thuggish plants. Most verges, smothered in cuttings, might as well be just strips of concrete.

‘Plantlife receives more calls on this subject than any other, from members of the public distraught and angry that their favourite verges full of cowslips and orchids are being mown down in the name of neatness and good management.’

One road verge in Warwickshire has the country’s largest population of pyramidal orchids and rockrose, the latter of which attracts the scarce brown argus butterfly.

The A30 and A38 roads in Cornwall and Devon support more than 1,000 acres of flower-rich grassland and one junction alone is home to six orchid species, including bee orchids and 1,100 greater butterfly orchids.

The charity says that the verges should be cut - and the cuttings removed - once early in the year and again in the late summer.

However, a survey by the charity found they were cut multiple times by the majority of councils over the summer while none of the councils collected the cuttings.

This allows the cuttings to rot down and add nitrate to the soil making it less compatible for wildflowers.

The Local Government Association (LGA) said keeping verges trimmed is safer for both drivers and pedestrians.

LGA environment and housing board chairman Mike Jones told the BBC that Britain’s wild flowers were important and councils encouraged native species “where they can”.

‘However, councils must strike the right balance between road safety and wildlife. Keeping road verges well maintained ensures that motorists have a good line of sight and allows pedestrians to walk more safely alongside busy roads,’ he added.

But Plantlife says that nearly all species benefiting from hay meadow management grow no higher than a foot.

Andy Byfield, landscape conservation manager for Plantlife, told the Independent on Sunday: ‘Cutting within a metre of the road and at junctions is fair enough.’ Britain has 937 square miles of verges, a total almost twice the size of Exmoor and the New Forest national parks combined.

Mr Byfield added: ‘The area of roadside verges we have in the country is the same size as the public forest estate, the projected sell-off of which provoked such a huge row. So why not also get worked up about saving a similarly large and important area for wildlife?’ Some councils do manage to protect selected verges for wild flowers including West Sussex County Council which maintains a list of “notable road verges”.

Plantlife said it is also working with several other councils, including Worcestershire and Hampshire, to protect plants including Deptford pinks and tower mustard.

A Highways Agency spokesperson said: ‘We have sown and planted more than 100 hectares of wild flowers and companion grasses on new road schemes in the past 20 years to act as a seed source to colonise wider areas. Our approach to management is to use a light touch.’
