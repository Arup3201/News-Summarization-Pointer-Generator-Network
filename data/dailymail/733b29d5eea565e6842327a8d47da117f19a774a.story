United Airlines' inaugural flight of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has touched down at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

United is the first U.S. airline to get Boeing's newest plane. United CEO Jeff Smisek was on Sunday's flight from Houston to Chicago and called the 787 the 'world's leading airplane'.

The landing was greeted by cheers from passengers, including some aviation enthusiasts who said they wanted to be part of a historic event.

It was a long time coming, as Boeing recently started delivering the jets after more than three years of delays.

More than 800 have been sold to airlines around the world, which Boeing has said will be more fuel efficient than comparable jets and more comfortable for passengers.

In July, debris from a brand-new Boeing 787 Dreamliner's engine sparked a fire at a South Carolina airport causing the airport to temporarily shut down.

The metal debris sparked a blaze with responding emergency crews having to close the Charleston International Airport for more than an hour.

An incident in February this year, saw Boeing report signs of 'delamination' occurring on a support structure in the Dreamliner's rear fuselage, launching an inspection.

Delamination occurs when repeated stress causes laminated composite materials to begin to separate.

Boeing responded by examining assembled Dreamliners for similar signs of stress while insisting their jets were all safe.
