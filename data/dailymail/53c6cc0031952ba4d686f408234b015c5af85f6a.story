A Pennsylvania man who has the misfortune of bearing a strong resemblance to the suspect in the killing of a state trooper has been awarded for his troubles with a car.

James Tully, 39, from Canadensis, was questioned by police more than 20 times during the intense manhunt for Eric Frein, who was captured October 30 after a 48-day manhunt.

Because he did not own a car, Tully had been forced to walk to work two hours each way along rural roads at the heart of the search zone, bringing him into nearly daily contact with troopers looking for the suspect.

He got a car! James Tully, 39, a man who had the misfortune of bearing a strong resemblance to suspected cop killer Eric Frein, was able to buy a car from donations collected on his behalf online

Tully used less than half of $24,000 donated via a GoFundMe account to buy this blue 2007 Subaru Outback

Thinking ahead: The man said that the rest of the raised funds will go towards gas, maintenance and insurance

On one occasion, Tully said that armed officers tackled him to the ground at gunpoint, holding him face-down in the gravel, knee in his back, while shouting at him to identify himself.

He has taken to carrying photo ID everywhere to prove he is not one of America's most wanted men.

The unfortunate doppelganger's plight brought him wide sympathy and led to a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe.com to get him a car so he could safely travel to and from work.

Just over $24,000 was raised, and on Wednesday Tully used less than half to buy a blue 2007 Subaru Outback.

'I'm truly overwhelmed by the community support and everything. I want to thank everyone for their support,' he told PA Homepage.

Tully, a separated father of two children, ages 4 and 11, who works at an aerospace manufacturing firm, said that the rest of the raised funds will go towards gas, maintenance and insurance.  

Speaking to the Pocono Record last month, he described how he was walking home one night down Route 447 after finishing work at midnight.

Violent encounter: Tully says that one officer who stopped him late at night pointed a rifle at him and pinned him to the floor with his knee

Necessary: Tully has started wearing visible photo ID to convince police he is not Eric Frein

He was stopped twice without incident - but the third officer to spot him leaped from his SUV 'screaming like a lunatic' and aiming his rifle straight at Tully, he said.

He said: 'The only ID I saw was the barrel of the gun. He yelled at me to get down on the ground with my arms out wide and he demanded my name.'

Despite tearing the ID badge out from under Tully, the officer, he said, continued to hound him.

He allegedly said 'I will break you right here - what is your name?' while pressing down on his bad back with one knee.

After a while a state trooper who had seen Tully before pulled up and calmed the situation - and promised to tell other searchers about him. He says he was stopped three times the next day.

He later checked into hospital, where he was told his ribs were bruised in the encounter. 

Tully told the Record that due to budget constraints he didn't own a car - and said nobody was available to give him a lift home because of his late hours.

Despite a bad knee and back, he had been walking to work every day - a five-mile trip which takes him two hours each way. 

In response to the article about Tully's plight in The Pocono Record, Dawn DiBiase, a friend of a friend of Tully's, set up the online fundraiser to help him buy a vehicle.

'Everybody wanted to help out and it was like a silver lining to the manhunt and everything,' the woman told PA Homepage.  

Tully, described as a humble, hardworking man, asked DiBiase to shut down the fundraiser once it's reached $24,200

Survivalist: Frein, right, was  on the run from state police and the FBI for 48 days 

Collared: Frein was finally arrested October 30 when he surrendered to the authorities in an open field near former Birchwood-Pocono Airpark

On Wednesday, a beaming Mr Tully arrived at the Halterman's Toyota Scion & Mitsubishi dealership in East Stroudsburg, accompanied by news cameras and photographers, to pick up his new set of wheels.

Matt Raymond, a digital marketing manager at the dealership, said he was overwhelmed by the generosity of the community. 

Police had spent weeks searching for Eric Frein in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, around where Tully lives and works.

Frein was finally arrested October 30 when he surrendered to the authorities in an open field near former Birchwood-Pocono Airpark after spending 48 days on the run. 

The 31-year-old survivalist and expert marksman is charged with opening fire on the Blooming Grove state police barracks September 12, killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Frein has been assigned two public defenders.
