With £100 in your pocket for a one-night hotel stay, you might be surprised to learn that you can check in for some five-star European luxury.

But if you're heading to New York, prepare to be disappointed - £100 a night will only ensure a stay in a one-star hotel.

Those looking to take a luxury holiday without a luxury price tag to match should consider a trip to either the medieval city of Pisa or the Polish capital Warsaw; the two most affordable luxury destinations, according to a report on hotel prices in top holiday destinations by Hotels.com.

Warsaw, being a UNESCO heritage city, offers tourist special memories - for £100 a night and five star luxury

The fabulous buildings of Pisa in Italy - and once you've explored you can settle in your 5 star hotel

Among the 59 global destinations examined for Hotels.com's Hotel Price Index (HPI), there were 23 where hotels with a four-star rating were enjoyed for an average £100 or less per night over this period, including Berlin, Lisbon and Prague in Europe. 

Asian destinations featured in this category included travel hotspots Shanghai and Jakarta. 

New York may entice shoppers, but £100 will only get you a 1 star room for one night

Geneva is well known for being at the top end of the price range, and £100 will get you a 1 star room

The HPI looked at average room prices paid by UK travellers in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. 

On home ground, Edinburgh achieved a three-star rating for less than £100 during the first half of 2014. Paris, Dubai and Hong Kong also fell into this range.

Meanwhile, a budget of £100 a night would only get travellers two-star accommodation in London. 

Dublin, often seen as costly to the English due to the Euro, is surprisingly available for 4 star with £100

Other destinations in this group include US cities such as Boston, San Francisco and Miami and other popular cities such as Venice and Vancouver.

Finally, £100 a night average would only cover one-star lodging in Geneva and New York.

Lizann Peppard of the Hotels.combrand says: 'It is understandable that UK travellers seek the best value when it comes to going away. So it is great to see that there are many destinations fairly close to home which are still attainable for those looking to balance their budget and still live large.'

The star rating that could be purchased with £100 a night or less on average in the world's top cities in the first six months of 2014.
