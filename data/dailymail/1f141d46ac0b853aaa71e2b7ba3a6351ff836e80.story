Hundreds of spectators were swept off their feet when the world's largest tidal bore surged up a river creating an exceptionally powerful wave.

The victims were standing on the banks of the Qiantang River in China's Zhejiang province yesterday when the surge took them by surprise.

The power of the river was exacerbated by Typhoon Trami, a devastating tropical storm which has swept across the region this week.

Swept away: Bystanders were knocked over by a tidal bore which swept up the Qiantang River in Zhejiang province

Unbelievable: Those affected looked like they were in shock at the hugely destructive power of the surge

Unique: The tidal bore occurs roughly once a day but was significantly worsened yesterday by the arrival of Typhoon Trami

Bystanders were supposedly protected by barriers lining the banks of the Qiantang at the time of the surge.

As well as knocking over spectators, the wave dragged off vehicles and flooded a water-treatment plant.

The river had reached a height of 6.6m, with the surge adding an additional 1.3m.

Surge: The wave overpowered the barriers and swept down into the town, drenching hundreds of spectators

Onslaught: The wave crashed over the levee and directly onto the car park where dozens of vehicles were standing

Aftermath: Cars, trucks and motorcycles suffered in the flash flood caused by the wave

The tidal bore in the Qiantang, which sees large waves created by the incoming tides from the East China Sea, is believed to be the biggest in the world and is the site of an annual Tide-Watching Festival.

It has been significantly worsened this week by the arrival of Typhoon Trami, which made landfall in Fujian province early yesterday morning.

The storm has brought heavy rain to the region, which has already been hit by flooding in the wake of Typhoon Utor.

Run away! Some seemed to enjoy the challenge of escaping from the incoming wall of water

Dramatic: The wave is always a prominent feature of the area, but it is rarely this extensive

Widespread: The whole river-side area was affected by the sudden influx of water caused by the tropical storm

Around 250 people were left dead or missing by the floods over the past week.

Trami
 wreaked havoc in the Philippine capital of Manila and in outlying 
regions, killing 18 people and leaving four others missing, but caused 
only minor damage when it passed over Taiwan.
