Law enforcement officials in Los Angeles have confirmed that they are in possession of a video that shows Bruce Jenner was responsible for starting a chain-reaction crash that resulted in a woman's death on a Malibu highway earlier this month.

Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade on February 7 when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on Pacific Coast Highway.

Jenner's SUV rear-ended two cars, pushing a white Lexus into oncoming traffic, the official said.

The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when it was struck head-on by a Hummer.

Law enforcement officials have confirmed they are in possession of a video that shows Bruce Jenner was responsible for starting a chain-reaction crash that resulted in a woman's death earlier this month 

The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter.

The official briefed on the video was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity.

The official said the video taken by cameras on an MTA bus in the area showed Jenner's vehicle continued forward and rear-ended a Toyota Prius. Officials initially said the victim's white Lexus had struck the Prius.

Most significantly  the video shows that the Lexus driver didn’t make contact with the Prius involved, reports TMZ.

Investigators have sought cellphone records to see if any drivers were distracted, but the video appears to show that Jenner was not using his phone. His publicist, Alan Nierob, has said Jenner was not texting and is cooperating with investigators.

The MTA video is alleged to show that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius

According to earlier reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead.

The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. 

The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed.

This latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars, claims TMZ. 

Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving.

It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius.

TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right.

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction, TMZ claims. 

Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision.

It is illegal to text while driving in California.

The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel.

Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.'

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'

But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles.

The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California.
