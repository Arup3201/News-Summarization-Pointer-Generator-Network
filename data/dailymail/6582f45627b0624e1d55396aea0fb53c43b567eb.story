A father and his four children were killed early this morning when their home in rural eastern Kentucky burned to the ground.

The bodies of Billy Wilfong, and his kids Dakota Lee, 5, Tyler Lane, 4, Cheyenne, 2, and 6-month-old Emily, were found within two feet of each other in the small Jonancy home's living room, where the family had been sleeping near an electric space heater, said Pike County Coroner Russell Roberts.

Wilfong's partner and the mother of the children, Tammie Tucker, survived the blaze, which began about 2:30 a.m. She was in critical condition on Wednesday afternoon after suffering serious burns.

A relative who lives nearby said she woke up early this morning to find the house engulfed.

'There was nothing I could do, I got second-degree burns just getting close to it,' said Glema Blair, the children's great-aunt.

Tucker's father, James Tucker, said he was awakened by his daughter beating on the window of his home, screaming 'Help, Daddy, help!'

'When I opened up the curtain and looked out the window, the whole house was up in flames,' James Tucker said.

His daughter yelled through the window, "I need help getting the babies out of the house."

Tucker rushed to the house but 'there wasn't no way I could get into it.'

Just after it started, Blair, who 
lives behind the home, ran to the fire and saw Tucker and her father 
attempting to get inside. Tammie Tucker was taken to UK Medical Center 
with burns all over her body.

'She was trying her best,' said Blair, who was fighting back tears.

The children and their mother were inseparable, said Vicki Elkins, mother-in-law to one of Tammie's sisters.

'It's going to take all her family pulling together,' Elkins said as she wondered how Tucker would endure such a heavy loss.

As
the house still-smoldered, neighbors and relatives gathered to remember
the loving father and bubbly children, vowing to support Tucker through the incomprehensible 
tragedy, if she survived.

Mourning: A makeshift memorial, pictured, was placed in front of the smoldering home on Wednesday afternoon

By afternoon, a makeshift memorial had sprung up at the single-story frame home, located on a narrow, serpentine road that leads up the Appalachian hillside.

Red flowers and four blue balloons decorated the memorial and included a collage with pictures of the father and four children, topped by a plastic gold angel.

Near the charred remnants of the home were a swing set and a tricycle.

The family had switched from burning wood to an electric heater and it was the only heat source in the living room where the family slept, James Tucker said.

Blair said Tucker lived in the home with the children's father. The two weren't married but had been together for about seven years, she said. However, Wilfong's Facebook page claims they were married.

Blair said she watched the kids often and that they loved to play outside and watch TV together.

'They were good kids, you couldn't ask for no better,' Blair said. Dakota liked robots and cartoons; Tyler was a monster truck fan and Cheyenne enjoyed playing with Barbie dolls. They were close-knit playmates, relatives said.

'That might be why the Lord took all four of them at the same time,' Elkins said.

Roberts said the bodies would be taken to the medical examiner's office in Frankfort, and it could take several days for positive identifications. The infant was found within a foot of the father, and all the victims were within about two feet of each other.

'They could've been overcome by that 
smoke and just went into like a deep sleep,' Roberts said. 'They just 
couldn't make it out.'

Fire investigators said the blaze was accidental and broke out in the living room where the space heater was found. A cause had not been determined. No officials could recall a similar deadly blaze in Kentucky since 10 people, including six children, were killed in a house fire in Bardstown in February 2007.

County Judge-Executive spokesman Brandon Roberts said there's been no similar fatal fire in Pike County in recent years.

'I can't remember a whole family perishing in a fire in my lifetime,' Roberts said. 'It's just, "Oh God."'

On Wilfong's Facebook page, the father wrote: 'My name is Billy Wilfong i am married to Tammie Wilfong the most beautiful and smartest woman that i know we have 4 childern together Dakota 5, Tyler 4,Cheyenne 2 and Emily and she is 2 months old...I Love My little family and wouldn't trade them for the world..(sic)'
