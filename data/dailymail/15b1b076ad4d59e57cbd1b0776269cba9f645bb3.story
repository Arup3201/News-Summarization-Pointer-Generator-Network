Every penny counts, especially for one young man who was able to pay off the rest of his college tuition with 500 pounds of them.

Andrew Magbee, 24, owed $974 to Southwestern Christian University and wanted his final payment to be an example to students that paying back student loans can become a learning experience.

He says he hopes his unique way of paying his bill will inspire college and high school students to think creatively and resourcefully.

He wants to, 'encourage them to think through the process of financing their education, how they're going to do it and what they're going to pursue to make it happen.'

Magbee used several different methods of collecting his large coin collection.

Magbee told KOCO, 'I collected aluminum cans and I turned them for scrap metal. I started a little sandwich shop, I mowed lawns and I painted houses.'

Magbee funded his $25,000 education all by himself and finished school without even one penny of debt, though he had to do a little heavy lifting.

$974 weighs 500 pounds and is enough to show that every single penny can make a huge difference and lighten the load of debt
