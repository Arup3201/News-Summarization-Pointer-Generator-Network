A pregnant Congresswoman who has been told by doctors not to travel has been refused permission to vote by proxy by Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi - who herself accused reporters of sexism for asking about her future. 

Illinois Democrat Rep. Tammy Duckworth is in the final weeks of her pregnancy.

A double amputee Iraq war veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter came under fire, the 46-year-old had asked for the ability to stay in Illinois to vote.

But despite her doctor's orders, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other bigwigs killed a proposal Thursday that would have let her participate remotely.

Hours earlier, Pelosi loudly questioned the motives of a female reporter who asked her whether the Dems' Nov. 4 drubbing might lead her to step down from her leadership post.

'As a woman, is there a message here?' the 74-year-old Californian asked. 'When was the day that any of you said to Mitch McConnell, when they lost the Senate three times in a row … "Aren't you getting a little old Mitch? Shouldn't you step aside?" Have any of you ever asked him that question?'

On the other side of the Capitol, another reporter was asking Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who is of the same gender as McConnell, whether he would step down after his party lost nine seats.

WAR ON WOMEN?: Rep. Tammy Duckworth won't be allowed to participate in House Democratic leadership elections next week

'AS A WOMAN ...': Nancy Pelosi spearheaded a move to deny a pregnant colleague a proxy vote in party elections just hours after playing her feminism card when a reporter asked her if she would give up her own leadership post

Duckworth wrote to House Democrats: 'I write to request your assistance regarding upcoming votes for our Caucus. As you are aware, I am in the final weeks of my pregnancy, and have been instructed by my physician not to travel. As a result, I will not be attending the upcoming Caucus meetings in person.'

'I would like to request a proxy vote on the upcoming leadership and ranking member elections that will come before the Caucus in the coming weeks.' 

Duckworth's fellow Illinoisan Jan Schakowsky made a motion to grant the request but Pelosi and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who co-chairs the Democratic Steering and Police Committee, objected, according to National Journal.

When Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin made a similar request for a proxy vote so she could attend a funeral on Tuesday, the room turned against Duckworth. 

DeLauro spokeswoman Sara Leonardo told National Journal that her boss 'does not want to set a precedent. There are many meritorious situations where the argument could be made for a waiver, including Congresswoman Duckworth's. The question is, how do you choose?.'

There may be an ulterior motive behind Pelosi's opposition to a pregnant colleague being allowed to bend the rules, however: The ranking minority slot in the House Energy Committee is up for grabs with the retirement of congressional lifer Henry Waxman, and Pelosi knows how tight the vote will be.

She is backing Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, while Minority Whip Steny Hoyer wants New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone to win the post. Duckworth is in the Pallone camp.

One senior aide told National Journal that House Democrats are playing favorites.

Three members whose re-election contests are still up in the air are being allowed to vote, even though ballot-counting is still underway and they might not keep their seats. 

'But here you have a woman, a decorated war veteran who is undergoing a high-risk pregnancy, and they can't suspend the rules,' the staffer said. 

There is no precedent for House Democrats allowing proxy votes in a leadership election, but Senate Democrats have permitted it at least once.

Louisiana Sen. Russell Long was permitted to vote in the Senate Majority Whip election in 1971 from his deathbed, choosing West Virginian Robert Byrd over Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy as he suffered from lung disease.

Byrd, who ultimately won, mistakenly thought it would be a close race, and argued for Long to have a vote.
