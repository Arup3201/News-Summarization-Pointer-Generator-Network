Luke Shaw will come through this, but he is playing like he has the handbrake on. Is he being overcoached?

Shaw was substituted at half-time in the 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final loss against Arsenal at Old Trafford. What has happened to the marauding full back who played with such freedom for Southampton? 

He is only 19 and he will come again, but the player Manchester United signed for £30million would hit crosses on the run and did his best work at the top end of the pitch. 

Luke Shaw has struggled to recapture his Southampton form at Manchester United

Shaw has not progressed in a similar manner to his former Southampton team-mate Nathaniel Clyne (right)

He isn’t doing that now. It looks to me as if he’s thinking too much and that will be down to him trying to carry out instructions. 

Shaw is going to be a star, but when you consider how Nathaniel Clyne is developing, why isn’t Shaw doing the same?

He is a young man, who has had his injuries, but he is struggling and was taken off at half-time  in a reshuffle that ultimately didn’t pay off.
