The owner of an Japanese Akita which attacked a three-year-old boy and left him needing 100 stitches has been told he will not have to destroy his dog.

Trafford-James Jackson-Poole required surgery on his left cheek and suffered a fractured eye socket after the brutal mauling at a pub in Newbold near Chesterfield in 2012.

Despite the horrifying incident, which left the boy with a permanent scar, Les Kirk-Kingstone, 63, was found not guilty of failing to control his dog after a hearing at Derby Crown Court.

Owner: Les Kirk-Kingstone with his Japanese Akita, Tyber. He was found not guilty of failing to control his dog after an incident which left a three-year-old boy requiring 100 stitches

The three-year-old was with his mother, Gemma Jackson, 29 , and his father, engineer James Poole, 31, when he wandered into another room at the Nag’s Head pub and was bitten in the face by the Akita.

Miss Jackson said: 'I heard a barking noise and then Trafford-James came in holding his face. The first thing I thought was "is he going to die"?

'I was in complete shock. He has been quite lucky because it could have been so much worse. It’ s frightening to think what could have happened.'

Scene: The attack occured at the Nag's Head in Newbold, Derbyshire, in December 2012

Following the attack in December 2012, Mr Kirk-Kingstone gave up a job he had after 35 years in the trade.

'I
 was absolutely devastated,' he said.

'I have lost three stones in 
weight with worry. I would rather have gone to prison that have my dog 
destroyed.

'Tyber was asleep
 in a private room when the little boy wandered in. He jumped onto the 
dog to play with him but he startled Tyber because he was asleep.'

After: The youngster suffered a fractured eye socket and has been left with a scar after he was mauled

Mr Kirk-Kingstone said his dog had 
previously saved him from a vicious street attack after two men attacked
 him and tried to snatch the pub’s takings.

'They
 kicked me to the floor,' he said. 'Tyber was in the car and saw I was 
in trouble. He jumped out of the window and the men ran off, he saved my
 life.

'All the locals have supported me, none of them wanted Tyber destroyed, he’s just a big softie.'

Miss Jackson, from Newbold, also mother to 
Jordan, 12, would not comment on the outcome of the court case but 
added: 'Trafford-James has been very quiet since it happened and not 
really himself.

Family: The youngster's mother, Gemma, was scared her son was 'going to die' in the aftermath of the mauling

He still has a scar, he won’t go near dogs now and is 
scared when he hears them barking.'

After
 the attack, she told the Daily Mirror: 'He's usually a really smiley 
boy but now when he smiles the left side of his smile turns down.

'Trafford keeps saying to me "am I still cute, Mum?"'

It
 is against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control in a 
public or private place where the dog isn’t allowed to be, such as a 
neighbour’s house or garden.
