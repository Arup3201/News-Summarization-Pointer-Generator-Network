Back in the 1990s, Michael J Garcia enjoyed stealing a moment behind the desk of the then US Attorney Mary Jo White.

‘The office felt pretty good,’ joked Garcia, then a young prosecutor. ‘I liked the chair.’

In 2005, that chair in arguably the most prestigious prosecutor’s office in America - Southern District of New York, with responsibility for eight counties including Manhattan - was his. After being sworn in, this son of a shipping company worker and a housewife from Valley Stream, Long Island, ‘shut the door for a few minutes, just to absorb it’.

The law man: Michael Garcia¿s investigation into alleged corruption has ruffled feathers among the FIFA membership

Now Garcia’s fame extends much further than the lower tip of New York. On Monday he was in Oman - temperature 37°C - as part of his inquiry into alleged corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The globe’s biggest sport awaits his findings.

But we need not wait as long as was expected after the Sunday Times this week published further claims about the scale of secret payments Qatar made to host the 2022 World Cup.

His need to evaluate new evidence might have delayed his inquiry by months. But after meeting Qatar officials in neutral Oman, he said he would close the investigation on Monday and submit his dossier of evidence to FIFA’s ethics committee in mid-July. ‘The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process,’ he said.

FIFA appointed Garcia, now 53, two years ago. His c.v. was impressive. He was an assistant in the US attorney’s office from 1992 to 2001, prosecuting Al Qaeda terrorists who bombed US embassies in Africa in 1998 and four defendants in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case.

He was under-secretary at Homeland Security, in charge of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, before President George W Bush appointed him a US attorney. In charge of 230 staff, he led the US government’s  criminal investigations into terrorism while tackling the staples of the Southern District job, white-collar and organised crime.

But his spell in New York was not without controversy. He was viewed by his detractors as a politicised figure - too close to the Bush regime. He was meant to be the Sheriff of Wall Street, responsible for the financial heart of the city, but failed to lead any aggressive investigation into those arguably responsible for the biggest crash since the 1929 Depression.

In contrast, he pursued the Democratic governor, Eliot Spitzer who, according to Scott Horton, contributing editor at the liberal-leaning Harper’s Magazine, was ‘on the verge of destroying the Republican Party in New York’.

‘Garcia’s colleagues had a generally positive impression of him but they (also) thought he had cultivated his rise by serving political masters,’ said Horton. ‘That is what appeared to be happening with Spitzer. So if you hire him for an investigation it would probably go along a predictable path: it would not embarrass those who hired him or be adverse in any way.’

Garcia, who refused to comment on Monday night, has always insisted that he did everything by the book with Spitzer, who paid money to a prostitution ring and resigned. Someone else with knowledge of Garcia said he was ‘thorough and forensic, absolutely clear and calm, and in command of his brief’.

After 16 years as a public servant, Garcia went into lucrative private practice at Chicago-based Kirkland Ellis, where he could earn an estimated £2m-£3m a year. The move was reportedly brought about by Jay Lefkowitz, a neo-con who wrote Bush’s cell research policy.

It was while at Kirkland that Garcia was appointed by FIFA to investigate the World Cup votes in 2010, and the presidential vote a year later.

FIFA’s ethics committee banned Mohamed bin Hammam, the central figure in the Sunday Times revelations, from football after Garcia cited a ‘conflict of interest’ in the Arab’s roles as president of the Asian Football Confederation and as a FIFA executive member.

The Sunday Times said Garcia has not interviewed Bin Hammam about the World Cup bidding process because he was not officially linked to the Qatar bid. That would seem a bizarre oversight, given the  millions of dollars he is alleged to have handed out as bribes.

U-turn? It is thought FIFA president Sepp Blatter is against Qatar hosting the World Cup despite his public backing

Not that the scope of Garcia’s inquiry has failed to create unrest among some FIFA members. Despite having been backed by 97 per cent of the governing body’s membership only a year ago, there was a plot to oust him this March during an executive meeting in Zurich, where he had arrived unannounced to question delegates.

That revolt failed, but he was told to hurry up and finish his report before the start of the World Cup, now nine days away.

Another intriguing question is what Sepp Blatter, the FIFA president who is universally expected to stand for re-election next year, wants from Garcia. It is thought that despite his public backing for Qatar, Blatter is opposed to their hosting the World Cup. He did not vote for them, unlike his nemesis, UEFA president Michel Platini, whose son Laurent is a leading figure at Qatar-backed French club PSG. Blatter would, therefore, wound Platini if Qatar were stripped of the World Cup.

Other aspects of Qatar are believed to irk him: the fact the tournament cannot be held in  summer, which necessitates a switch to winter. That in turn upsets the order of world football and jeopardises FIFA’s £1billion TV rights deal with Fox and Telemundo, a Spanish subsidiary of NBC, to show the football at a time of year when the NFL is not in full swing.

The death of a thousand migrant workers in the building of the stadiums is another reason for Qatar to be stripped of host status.

But before FIFA’s ethics committee and the executive make their next move, they will study the findings of Garcia, the father of three who holds the football world in his hands.
