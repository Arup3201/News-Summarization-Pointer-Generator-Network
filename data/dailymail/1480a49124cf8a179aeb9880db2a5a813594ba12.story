The last minute dash to secure tickets to one of America's biggest sporting tournaments has begun after the two teams to play in this year's Super Bowl have been revealed.

Fans of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens who hadn't already purchased tickets are now doing all they can to try and secure passes to see their teams in action.

And with just two weeks to go before the big game, a single ticket is selling for an average $3,000.

Winning moment: San Francisco 49ers celebrate after their 28-24 win against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship game on Sunday, which will see them compete in the Super Bowl final

The finalists: Baltimore Ravens players cheer after beating the New England Patriots in Foxborough to advance to Super Bowl XLVII

The prices have shot up from around $2,000 on Sunday morning, just a few hours before the final playoff games determined who would be going head to head in Super Bowl 2013.

Director of data and communications at ticket website TiqIQ, Chris Matcovich, told ABC News the match will be a 'golden game' for ticket sales for two reasons.

One is that the two teams are coached by two brothers - Jim Harbaugh with the 49ers and his brother John Harbaugh with the Ravens - has added an extra twist to this Super Bowl.

Second, is that the 49ers - who haven't won a Super Bowl since 1995 - has a large fan base in San Francisco who may be happy to travel to New Orleans to see their team's triumphant return.

Mr Matcovich told ABC News: 'At the end of the day, marketers and ticket sellers are hoping for a good game and praying for the right teams.'

The official list prices for the Super Bowl’s upper bowl, lower bowl and club seats are $850, $950 and $1,250 respectively for 2013.

But any fan hoping to get their hands on a ticket now, will pay a minimum of $1,700, according to prices listed on TiqIQ. 

And if last year's prices are anything to go by, with an average ticket selling for $10,000, then the cost is going to just keep soaring until kick-off on February 3.
