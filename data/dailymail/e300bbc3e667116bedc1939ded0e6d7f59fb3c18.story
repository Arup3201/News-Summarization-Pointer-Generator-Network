ACCC chairman Ros Sims said at the Federal Court on Wednesday petrol retailers worked together to drive up prices

Five petrol retailers across Melbourne have been accused of colluding on bowser prices using a third-party service to share pricing information and drive prices up.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says five major petrol retailers - BP, Caltex and the fuel-selling arms of Coles, Woolworths and 7-Eleven - acted in a way that could increase the cost of fuel.

The case launched in the Federal Court on Wednesday says the way the retailers used a statistics gathering service, run by the company Informed Sources, was a breach of Australian competition law.

'The ACCC alleges that petrol retailers that subscribe to the Informed Sources service use (it) to exchange information on the price they each offer at their petrol stations on a private, and near real-time, basis,' ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

'The exchange of this information allows retailers to monitor and respond to each other's prices and observe and analyse the pricing behaviours and strategies of their competitors,' Mr Sims continued.

The service requires retailers to input their bowser prices and, in return, they receive the same information from their rivals.

Caltex rejected that it breached competition law, and said it will defend ACCC action

On its website Informed Sources says it provides 'competitive information to dynamic markets around the world'.

The ACCC says the us of this allowed not only rapid price matching, but retailers could use the system to 'propose a price increase to their competitors and monitor the response to it'.

They also revealed that a net petrol price increase of one cent per litre over a year could cost Australian consumers around $190 million.

BP told Daily Mail Australia in a statement they are 'confident that BP has acted lawfully at all times', but could not comment further due to the ongoing proceedings.

BP also said they have not acted unlawfully but would not comment further

The ACCC says the used the system not only to rapidly price match but propose a price increase to their competitors and monitor the response to it

Caltex has rejected the assertion its use of Informed Services' Oil Price Watch (OPW) service was a breach of competition law, and says it will defend the ACCC action.

'The OPW data consists of pricing information that is otherwise publicly available to everyone on petrol price boards,' it said in a statement.

'The OPW service simply makes it cheaper for subscribers to collect this data.'
