Andrew Lansley, the then health secretary, said he was ‘staggered’ by the cost and pledged to cut it by 40 per cent over the next four years

The NHS is being held to ransom by management consultants who charge up to £4,000 a day, a top academic has warned.

Professor David Oliver compared the outside experts to ‘arms dealers’ and ‘racketeers’.

The health service’s expenditure on such advisers has more than doubled to £640 million from £313 million in 2011/12.

This is enough to employ an extra 2,000 nurses, 700 senior doctors or run three medium-sized hospitals.

The increase comes despite the Government promising to ‘slash’ the amount the NHS spends on consultants shortly after coming to power in 2010.

Andrew Lansley, the then health secretary, said he was ‘staggered’ by the cost and pledged to cut it by 40 per cent over the next four years.

But an investigation by Professor Oliver, a former Department of Health adviser, has concluded that it has only got worse – leading to ‘yet more taxpayers’ money diverted from already struggling health and social care services’.

The City University professor, who now advises the King’s Fund think-tank, said there was a ‘constantly revolving door’ of bureaucrats moving between the Department of Health and other NHS bodies, No 10 and consulting firms.

Some charge between £3,000 and £4,000 a day – the same amount a well-paid senior doctor earns in two weeks – and told Professor Oliver they would not be taken seriously if the bill was any less.

The academic, a former national clinical director for older people, said he himself had been offered ‘obscene’ amounts to advise the NHS, but had declined, suggesting he do so for free.

He also pointed out that many of these so-called experts have no ‘coalface experience’ of the NHS bodies they are meant to be advising and have come straight from university.

Writing in the BMJ online journal, he likened them to those who profit from war, making ‘similar spoils’ from chaotic hospitals and trusts.

The NHS is facing an unprecedented financial crisis as it struggles to meet the demands of the ageing population.

Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, recently warned the health service needs at least an extra £8 billion of public money by 2020 to maintain the same standards of care for patients.

Dr Clive Peedell, a cancer specialist at South Tees Hospital, Middlesbrough, and member of the National Health Action Party, said: ‘This Government’s disastrous and wasteful NHS reorganisation has enabled management consultants to cash in on our NHS and syphon off millions that should be spent on patients while hiding behind a cloak of unaccountability.’

He added: ‘It’s disempowered those best placed to make decisions about how to run the NHS … doctors and NHS staff on the frontline, and it’s speeded up the revolving doors culture between civil servants, politicians and management consultants, which perpetuates the problem.’

Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘These figures show that ministers were throwing money like confetti at private consultants at the same time as cutting nursing posts and cancer care.’

Earlier this year it emerged the struggling Medway hospital trust in Gillingham, Kent, was paying a management consultant nearly £200,000 a year to work just one or two days a week

Barts and the London NHS trust in east London spent nearly £1million in just ten months on a management consultant acting as a ‘turnaround director’.

Donald Muir, an executive at the Surrey-based firm Global Titanium Solutions, charged £935,000 for his expertise from October 2013 to June 2014.

Many consultants profiting from the NHS come from the largest firms – including McKinsey, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and KPMG.
