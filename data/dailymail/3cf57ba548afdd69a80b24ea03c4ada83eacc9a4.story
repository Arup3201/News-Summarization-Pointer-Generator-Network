One of Las Vegas' most famous drag queens has revealed the results of his 16th plastic surgery - an addiction which started out as a teenager.

Frank Marino, 50, who has been playing Dolly Parton on the strip for more than 30 years, went under the knife on December 9 to have his eyes lifted and a jaw implant inserted.

He told 13 Action News that he was striving for more 'chiseled features like Katharine Hepburn' and does not plan on getting anymore work done in the future.

New year, new me: Mr Marino, pictured with comedienne Lisa Lampanelli, said he was striving for more 'chiseled features like Katharine Hepburn'

The native New Yorker had his first surgery at the age of 16 and has since had four chin jobs, three nose jobs, cheek implants, an eye lift and a neck job.

One doctor refused to give him buttock and pectoral implants as they warned it would be overload.

'She [said] one is dangerous [the butt] and one is unnecessary. She said, "Use the poor man’s surgery and go to the gym,'"' Mr Marino told the Review Journal.

He has also had filler injections, Botox and laser skin resurfacing to help reverse the signs of aging.

Asked what his appearance would be like if he had
 never subjected his body to a surgeon’s scalpel, he replied: 'I would look like a shark.

'I had buck teeth, a big nose, and no chin. With a little work, I look like Pamela Anderson.'

'I would look like a shark without any plastic surgery. I had buck teeth, a big nose, and no chin'

His most recent 'enhancement' required the steady hands of two doctors who worked for eight hours remodeling his face.

'Everybody’s telling me I’m crazy and I shouldn’t do it,' he said. 'But everybody around me is young.

'In Vegas, so many people have plastic surgery but refuse to admit it.'

Dr Goesel Anson, who helped perform Mr Marino's surgery, said his line of work made him a 'tough patient'.

Addiction: Mr Marino started getting plastic surgery at the age of 16 and said from there he was hooked

'He
 dresses as a woman during the show . . . he has two conflicting 
desires. One is to look feminine the other is to maintain his 
masculinity.'

Now with a 'new face, new material and new acts,' Mr Marino is gearing up for his return to the stage next month.

In 2010 Mr Marino celebrated performing in his 20,000th show.

'The first 17 years I did three shows a 
night, over 10 million people. I've had over 350,000 costume changes. I 
change more times than Cher,' he exclaimed at the time.

The performer (pictured in 2006, left, and in 2013, right) says: 'I go on stage every night. . . and these kids are in their twenties. I want to be able to look good for me, the way they look good for themselves.'

What a difference three years make: Mr Marino seems to different shaped nose in 2007 (left) compared to in 2010 (right) - he said he got his nasal cavity chiseled down three times in a bid to get the 'perfect look'

A-listers including Britney Spears, the late Whitney Houston, Sandra Bullock and Dolly Parton herself have turned out to see Mr Marino in action.

On the subject of plastic surgery, the larger-than-life performer concluded: 'It becomes addictive I'm not going to lie. It's not for everyone, I'm not recommending it to anyone.

'I go on stage every night. . . and these kids [in the audience] are in their twenties. I want to be able to look good for me, the way they look good for themselves.'
