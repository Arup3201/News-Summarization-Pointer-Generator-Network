Forget black and white, red and white, love and hate, if you’re a good footballer you’ll be just fine.

That is what Lee Clark always told himself, the Geordie boy who swapped Newcastle for Sunderland in 1997.

Like Clark, Jack Colback was raised on Tyneside and has now made the controversial switch between the North-East rivals, a move only 14 have dared to undertake.

For Colback, though, his defection represented a homecoming – not that the direction of travel and childhood allegiance makes any difference, says Clark.

‘It doesn’t matter if you’ve gone from Sunderland to Newcastle or Newcastle to Sunderland or which team you supported – if you’re a good footballer and playing well then fans will take to you,’ the former midfielder told Sportsmail ahead of Colback’s first Tyne-Wear derby for the Magpies.

‘And in that respect Jack will be just fine. He’s been one of Newcastle’s best players so far this season.

The 25-year-old's performances in the first part of the season earned him a call up to the England squad

‘It probably helps a little bit that he’s a Geordie coming back to Newcastle, but if you’re playing poorly that doesn’t make any difference really. 

‘It’s all about the football, it always is. Jack scored for Sunderland at St James’ last year and I bet their fans loved him that day.

‘I always told myself when I went to Sunderland, “Play well, hit the ground running, and the fans will clap me”.

‘What matters for Jack now is that the Newcastle fans have taken to him – and they’ve done that for one reason, he’s been excellent this season.’

Former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn spoke out this week expressing his regret that 25-year-old Colback – who joined the Black Cats at the age of 10 - had been allowed to sign for Newcastle on a free transfer.

Clark, though, sits on the other side of that fence. ‘It was one of the best bits of business of the summer getting Jack for nothing,’ said the current boss of Championship Blackpool.

‘He’s the sort of player you want in your team – he keeps the ball, works hard and you can rely on him. He’s been a massive part of what Newcastle have done this season.’

Clark enjoyed two years on Wearside before being pictured supporting Newcastle at the 1999 FA Cup final wearing a t-shirt that read 'Sad Mackem B******s'. The t-shirt was, in fact, thrown over him by a supporter and the photo snapped in a flash.

The incident forced him to quit Sunderland for Fulham. Nonetheless, he has no regrets about making the move to the Stadium of Light.

‘The group of players and the manager, Peter Reid, made it easy for me when I went there,’ he said.

Clark says Colback has won the Newcastle fans over by producing excellent performances

Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, including against Newcastle last season

Colback will come up against his former team-mates for the first time on Sunday

‘They were first-class and I had a great couple of years. We reached the play-off final in my first season then won the First Division with a record points total the year after, and I played a big part in that.’

Clark – a former England schoolboy captain and Under-21 regular – was included in full squads but never made his senior debut.

Colback, meanwhile, was called up by Roy Hodgson in August only to withdraw because of injury and hasn’t been involved since.

That, however, will change before the season is out says Clark. ‘Without a doubt he is good enough to get back in,’ he said.

‘Roy Hodgson obviously liked him earlier in the season and he’s probably playing better now. I think Jack should be aiming for another call-up. For me, it would be deserved.’
