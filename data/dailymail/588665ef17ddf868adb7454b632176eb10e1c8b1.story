Seizure: Maggie O'Connor, 26, was walking her dog Dillion when she had the fit. She said the men were laughing at her because she had wet herself

An epileptic woman who suffered a severe fit woke up to find two strangers laughing at her and filming the ordeal on their mobile phones.

Maggie O’Connor, 26, was walking her dog in the grounds of St Botolph's Priory in Colchester, Essex, when she had a fit.

She woke up to find two men standing over her filming her as they laughed about how she had wet herself during the seizure.

Miss O'Connor explained that she was covered in blood after having bitten her tongue and had also wet herself - both of which are common occurrences for some sufferers of epilepsy during a fit.

One of the men, who Miss O'Connor described as being in their 20s, put a mobile phone inches from her face in order to get a close-up, she said. He only stopped filming when her Staffordshire bull terrier Dillion growled protectively.

Miss O'Connor, who has had epilepsy since she was 16, wrote about her shocking experience on Facebook in a bid to 'find the boys'. The post has been shared more than 3,000 times but the pair have not been traced.

Essex Police have said they won't investigate the incident because a criminal offence has not taken place.

Miss O'Connor said: 'With a seizure, you can wet yourself and bite your tongue and these were the two facts that they seemed to find most hilarious as I had wet myself and I had blood down my front.

'They continued filming whilst I was awake and conscious but because I had had the seizure I was in a really vulnerable position.

'There was nothing I could do - my legs were too jelly to move and I could not string a proper sentence together so I just had to sit there whilst they tried to humiliate me by videoing me.

'Even though I had woken up, they only stopped filming because Dillion started growling. One even took the time to do a close up of my face. The last thing I heard as they ran away was “she f**king pissed herself, ha".'

She added: 'How would they have felt if it was their sister or mum it had happened to?'

Miss O'Connor was also angered because a number of other people ignored what was happening.

She said: 'There were plenty of people in the park and no-one stepped which makes me cross.'

She added that she found it bizarre that no offence had been committed.

She said: 'It's
 shocking in a sense that no offence has been committed but I was in a 
public area so people can film what they want - it's morally wrong though.'

The 26-year-old suffers seizures approximately every two weeks and is left almost completely incapacitated for about four to five minutes.

The number of fits Miss O'Connor, a hairdresser, suffers has increased in the past year and has left her unable to work.

She is now hoping to raise awareness about epilepsy following her ordeal and hopes that other people will be more understanding when they see sufferers having a fit.

Stacey Rennard, from charity Epilepsy Action, said about 600,000 people in the UK had epilepsy.

She said that there are about 40 different kinds of seizures and 'some are easier to recognise than others'.

Ms Rennard said: 'In Maggie’s case, it was very upsetting to hear she was in a vulnerable position and sustained an injury and still people didn’t stop and help her.'

She said the charity hears about a wide variety of experiences and that some are bad 'like in this horrible case'.

She added: 'We do hear from people who’ve come across the good Samaritans who’ve sat and waited with them while they recover.'

An Essex Police spokeswoman said: 'No criminal offence has been committed.'
