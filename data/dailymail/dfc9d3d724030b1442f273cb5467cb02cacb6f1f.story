Leicester manager Nigel Pearson called for the introduction of video technology after his side fell victim to two terrible penalty decisions in Thursday's 2-2 draw at Liverpool.

Leicester were particularly incensed by referee Mike Jones’ decision to award a 17th minute spot kick for handball when the ball clearly hit Wes Morgan in the face.

That provoked Match of the Day’s Gary Lineker, himself an ex-Leicester player, to tweet: ‘Worst penalty decision ever as Mike Jones gives handball against Leicester’s Morgan at Anfield when it hit him in the face. Wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on MOTD. I reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night.’

Liverpool were the beneficiaries of a decision that Gary Lineker described as the 'worst penalty decision ever'

Pearson added: ‘It’s unfortunate to have to deal with two occasions like that, The game could be a lot easier if we used what is available to us. This is the problem the game has because we expose human beings to making errors. The officials are there to do a job and we could make it much easier if technology was utilised.’

‘We’ve got it [as a coaching staff]. It takes a couple of seconds. That could have been reviewed instantaneously.

‘In European games, we have seen the introduction of further assistants in the penalty area. It’s a question for the governing bodies of the games. Do i think it should be there? Yes.’

Leicester were 2-0 down at half-time after Steven Gerrard converted the two spot-kicks but recovered in remarkable fashion, as long-distance strikes from David Nugent and Jeffrey Schlupp salvaged a draw. 

Referee Jones awarded the controversial penalty

Hapless referee Mike Jones started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding Liverpool a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Leicester's Wes Morgan on the head as he slid to block Raheem Sterling's cross. 

Jones clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of Morgan but replays showed that was not the case. 

Referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who admitted the ball struck Morgan’s head, hit out at his team’s complacency as they missed a golden opportunity to close down the gap between themselves and the Champions League places. They are remain 8th and seven points behind Southampton

‘I thought we got what we deserved in the end,’ Rodgers said, ‘I don’t think we played well and Leicester played very well. We gave away poor goals, giving the ball away very cheaply. We didn’t play well enough to merit a win.

‘We had a plan in place for after we score or after the opponent scored and a clear idea of what to do but kept giving way simple possession. Even things like ten yard passes, we would recover the ball and lose it again. The lead should be enough but we just made too many mistakes.’
