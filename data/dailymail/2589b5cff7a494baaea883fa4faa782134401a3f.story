The 12-year-old daughter of a disgraced Utah doctor accused of murdering his wife in 2007 is waiting for a judge to decide if she would be allowed to take the stand against her father.

Martin MacNeill, 58, is expected to go on trial next week for allegedly killing his wife by making her overdose on medications so he could pursue a relationship with his younger mistress.

Michele MacNeill, 50, was discovered drowned in a bathtub by her 12-year-old daughter, Ada, in the family's home in April 2007.

Objection: MacNeill's attorney, Susanne Gustin (left), argued that Ada should not be allowed to testify because the prosecution had allowed the girl's older sister to interview her about the killing

Mr MacNeill, a once-prominent physician and Mormon Sunday school teacher, was arrested in September 2012 and charged with first-degree murder.

With the trial just days away, MacNeill's attorney, Susanne Gustin, argued Tuesday that her client's youngest daughter should not be allowed as a witness in the trial, ABC News reported.

Gustin argued that the teen's testimony would be tainted because the prosecution allowed the girl's older sister to interview her about the killing.

Deputy Utah County Attorney Chad Grunander responded to the charge by insisting that there is no evidence to suggest that Ada had been swayed by her two older sisters, who have long held the belief that MacNeill murdered their mother. 

'I think he drugged my mother and drowned her,' MacNeill's daughter Alexis Somers said in 2012. 'It's been horrifying, and horrifying that we had to wait for this day so long.'

Judge Derek Pullan called the prosecution’s decision to allow Somers to question her sister, who was 6 years old at the time, rather than using an independent expert, ‘troubling,’ according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

MacNeill's daughters Alexis Somers and Rachel MacNeill will testify against their father, whom they have long believed to be responsible for their mother's death

Safe haven: Michele MacNeill was found floating fully clothed in a tub in the family's home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, in April 2007

Somers and her sister Rachel MacNeill will testify for the prosecution. The defendant’s alleged mistress, Gypsy Willis, is also expected to take the stand.

Martin MacNeill was released from a Texas federal prison last year after serving three years for fraud.

On Tuesday, Judge Pullan ruled that two of his former cellmates and another inmate from a Utah prison would be allowed to testify in the upcoming trial. 

According to Alexis Somers, Ada had told her that on April 11, 2007, their father had instructed her to go check on her mother in the bathroom while he remained in the kitchen.

The girl walked into the room and found Michele MacNeill unconscious in the tub. The 50-year-old woman was fully clothed in a blue jogging suit and had her eyes open.

The prosecution believes that the 58-year-old Mormon patriarch gave his wife a dangerous cocktail of sleeping pills, painkillers and anxiety medications while she was recovering from a facelift he had allegedly forced her to have.

Martin MacNeill has denied that he had anything to do with his wife's death, telling investigators that Michele drowned and he called 911.

The jury selection phase will begin Tuesday, and the trial is expected to last about five weeks.  

Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying against him on Wednesday. They had an affair for more than a year before the death

During a preliminary hearing last year, Gypsy Willis revealed to the court that she met Martin MacNeill online in 2005 and for the first time in person that 
November, before beginning a sexual relationship in January 2006, the Deseret News reported.

Yet when they began their relationship, she did not see it having a future, she said.

'It was just for fun,' Willis said. 'It was whenever we could get together. It was just friendly.'

As they continued their relationship, she continued to see other men and never considered there was any chance that MacNeill would leave his wife for her, she said. 

'He had great respect and love for Michele,' she said. 'He said he had a family and was very happy.'

She moved into a duplex that MacNeill owned and provided her with an unlimited credit card to help her get through nursing school, she said. She used it for gas, groceries and coffee.

Fall from grace: MacNeill, pictured speaking with his defense lawyer Susanne Gustin, moved Willis into his family home as his children's nanny weeks after the death of his wife

After the death of Michele MacNeill, which was initially ruled as natural causes, the circumstances of their 
relationship changed and Willis said she and her lover began talking 
about a future together.

'Martin told me he felt very sorry we 
had been involved prior to Michele's death,' she said. 'He was embarrassed about 
that. He wanted me to come help him and support him.'

Heartbroken: Rachael MacNeill, one of MacNeill's daughters, testified that her father took her to a temple to pray for a nanny before 'bumping' into Willis, who he pretended not to know

After the death of his wife, MacNeill and Willis were convicted of identity fraud and served years in prison for stealing
the identity of MacNeill's 16-year-old adopted daughter.

When she left federal prison, Willis was convicted on a state charge but prosecutors agreed not to seek extra jail time - provided she testified against her lover.

Yet defense attorney Randy Spencer said he thinks the testimony did little to help their case.

'Mr. MacNeill has done a lot 
of bad things in his life,' he said. 'Just because you're a bad man, however, does 
not make you a murderer.'

While
they were imprisoned, the couple wrote to each other and planned to 
make a future but now, 'quite honestly, we have both lost everything', 
she said.

After the murder, the MacNeill 
children fought relentless for police to re-open the case into their 
mother's death, certain their father had killed her.

An autopsy indicated she died of 
natural causes, but a 2010 addendum to that report questioned the manner
of death and authorities
now believe she was drugged by her husband.

The unravelling of the MacNeill family
began in 2005 when her father started losing weight, tanning and acting
strangely, even disappearing for days at a time.

Stunning: MacNeill allegedly forced his wife Michele, pictured, into having a facelift and gave her a lethal mix of drugs as she was recovering. He found her dead in the bathtub of their home

Doting: Michele was described as a loving mother who did everything for her children and her husband

In 2007, Michele became convinced her husband was 
having an affair after she found out the same number had been called over 
and over again at strange hours of the morning.

A few days later, MacNeill came to his wife with a strange request: He wanted her to have a facelift.

Two weeks later, she had the surgery and was back at home recovering with Valium, Percocet, Phenergan and Ambien pills, supplied by her husband.

A
few days later, as she struggled with her recovery, she told her daughter: 'In case anything happens to me,
make sure it was not your father.'

Michele was found dead in the bathtub just eight days after the surgery.

MacNeill
claimed his wife slipped and fell, and he discovered her on returning home from collecting his then six-year-old daughter.

'Killed': Prosecutors say MacNeill did not give his wife CPR, as he had claimed, and purposefully gave the 911 dispatcher the wrong address to further delay emergency responders

In a series of frantic 911 calls, he hung up on the 
operator three times in five minutes. He lied to the dispatcher about performing CPR
and gave the wrong address of his residence, which delayed emergency
responders, prosecutors claim.

According to an affidavit, Utah State Medical Examiner Todd Grey said the 
combination of medicines found in her body, which may have been forced 
upon her and could have been lethal.

'When
my father called I knew he'd killed her,' Alexis Somers said. 
'I just started screaming he killed her. My father planned 
and orchestrated my mother's death and thought he could get away 
with it.'

Family members have said 
they suspect Willis was also involved in Michele MacNeill's death, but 
she has not been charged in the case.
