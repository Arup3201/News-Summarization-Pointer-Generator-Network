With a new pill that claims to boost female libido set to hit shelves in three years, two women have been at loggerheads on live television debating the pros and cons of such a medical advancement.

Journalists Shona Sibary and Kelly Rose Bradford appeared on This Morning to share their thoughts on Lybrido - known informally as 'female Viagra' or 'Sheagra' - with Sibary believing no such pill could work on women as it does with men, because for females sex is too dependent on an emotional connection.

Bradford, however, said women 'have a responsibility to keep their libidos high' for their partners, and believes the pill could help save floundering marriages.

Speaking to Dr Dawn Harper and married presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Bradford said the pill could help women suffering from a low sex drive to stop their husbands straying.

Turning to mother-of-four Sibary - who has said publicly in the past that she would 'rather mop the floor' than have sex with her husband - Bradford commented that it would 'solve all your problems'.

Sibary retorted that the pill would in fact 'cover up' the problems, and would not necessarily keep her husband happy, adding: 'Would it? How nice is it for my husband to know that the only reason I'm leaping into bed with him is because I've popped a pill?'

Dr Harper added that for a woman to lose her libido is a serious thing, but that the pill - not manufactured by the same pharmaceutical company that make Viagra - should be considered as an option only by women who are happy in their marraiges and for whom a low libido is their only complaint.

Could this pill save your marriage?

She said: 'I think the pill does have a place among the few women who have lost their libido and would very much like it back, but who are otherwise happy.

'There are others who have lost their libidos for different reasons - maybe they are unhappy in their marraige or don't fancy their man anymore - but that's a different issue.'

Sibary said women are more complicated sexually than men, and that the pill would not stimulate females emotionally.

She said: 'If you're a man and you want to have sex for the sake of 
having it, fine, pop a pill and have sex in the mechanical way.

'But 
women are different. I'm the type of woman this drug is targeting, and we 
want to feel desirable and desired: it's not a chemical thing, it's an 
emotional thing.'

Dr Harper said that while Viagra's secondary, mechanical side effect was discovered while creating a pill for angina, the female libido pill works more like an anti-depressant and so does stimulate emotions.
