Sky Sports News presenter Kaveh Solhekol was forced to abandon his post on transfer deadline day after a Crystal Palace supporters' group let off flares outside the club's training ground.

The group - Holmesdale Fanatics - chanted 'We f****** hate Sky Sports' and unveiled a banner which read 'Sky Sports - killing our game since 1992'.

Several red flares were released as fans marched down a road, leaving Solhekol with little option but to stop reporting.

The group was formed in 2005 by fans who had stood at the back of the Holmesdale Stand at Selhurst Park. 

Their aim was to create a strong unit based on the terraces of old. 

Palace keeper Julian Speroni hailed the group's support as 'brilliant' last season. 

His colleague Geraint Hughes, meanwhile, had to move inside at Arsenal to announce the £16million signing of Danny Welbeck from Manchester United.

As a result of these and other embarrassing incidents, Sky Sports are under pressure to make changes to their show.

The television network's visual coverage of the day's events has become hugely popular in recent years.

Sky Sports News' tried-and-trusted formula is to deploy reporters and camera crews at all 20 Premier League clubs and many others around the country. 

Throughout the day, however, the 20 news teams - who hosted 270 live broadcasts - are usually joined by dozens of supporters keen to join in the excitement.

But festivities turned X-rated on numerous occasions as some supporters sought to wreck the coverage with unruly behaviour.

One reporter at Everton was forced to continue with a live broadcast while one fan thrust a sex toy into his ear. Another reporter saw one of his night broadcasts interrupted by a naked blow-up doll.

Likewise, the constant use of bad language from some fans left Sky Sports with no option but to cut straight back to the studio, leaving presenters to apologise to viewers. 

A Sky spokesman said: 'Millions of viewers followed our coverage of Transfer Deadline Day which included over 270 live reporter updates from outside football clubs over the final 24 hours. 

'We apologise to those whose enjoyment was spoiled by a small number of incidents and we’re looking into ways to avoid this happening again in the future whilst ensuring fans remain a key part our live coverage.'
