Raking it in: A total of 73,536 fines were handed out across Britain last year - the equivalent of 201 every day

Two hundred people a day are being fined for dropping litter – prompting fears that councils and private firms are dishing out tickets to make money.

A total of 73,536 penalties were handed out across Britain last year for dropping rubbish, equivalent to 201 a day. Of that total, 63,883 were issued in England – up from just 727 in 1997.

And some town halls are earning more than £650,000 a year from the tickets, a new report has revealed.

An increasing number of local authorities – who get to keep more than half the money raised – are  turning to a private company run by ex-Armed Forces personnel to issue on-the-spot fines.

Victims say wardens, often wearing police-style uniforms, lie in wait for smokers or follow them down the street and ‘pounce’, hitting them with a £75 fine even if they put cigarette butts down drains.

One woman was wrongly convicted of giving false details after her local council tried to track her down on Facebook.

And a teenage boy was accused of littering when he threw a twig into a river while playing the time-honoured game of Pooh Sticks.

Others have been fined for accidentally dropping orange peel or nut shells.

Josie Appleton, of the libertarian group The Manifesto Club, which compiled the new study, said: ‘Over the past few years, in some councils, litter fines have become a business.

‘When punishment is motivated by profit, it is more likely that fines will be issued for more minor but easy-to-catch offences, rather than those that are harming the public amenity.’ 

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said councils should not be 'using residents as cash cows'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘Members of the public who shamelessly litter and flytip should be brought to book. But councils shouldn’t be using residents as cash cows.’

The new report, The Corruption Of Punishment: How Litter Fines Became A Business – shows that the largest number of litter fines handed out in one area last year was 8,865 in Newham, East London.

That earned the local council £664,875.

At least 12 councils have so far employed one private firm, Xfor, to issue fines.

Freedom of information requests suggest the company has made £1,636,547 after its 51 officers handed out 43,478 tickets.
