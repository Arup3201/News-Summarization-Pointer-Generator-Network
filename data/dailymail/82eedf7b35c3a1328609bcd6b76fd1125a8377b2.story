A driver was so drunk he pulled up in the fast lane of the M25 to have a sleep.

James Dance was driving along the motorway almost four times over the alcohol limit at 20mph just after 9am.

The 59-year-old, who was in a Ford Mondeo, was spotted by other motorists as he weaved between lanes two and three of the motorway.

Busy: James Dance, 59, was four times over the limit at 9am as he drove along the UK's busiest road

Eventually, Mr Dance, from Lewisham in South London, came to a halt near Westerham, Kent, and fell asleep at 9.25am on Tuesday October 22.

He got out of his car and waited near the central reservation when he was awoken by a concerned driver who stopped and called the police.

Kumud Singh, prosecuting, told Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court: 'A member of the public contacted police saying a Mondeo was being driven on the approach to the Clacket Lane Services at 20mph on the outside lane and holding up traffic and weaving between lanes two and three.

'They thought the driver was ill or drunk.'

Sentencing: Dance admitted drink driving. He will be sentenced next month at Sevenoaks Magistrate's Court

Police said in a report that Mr Dance was ‘unsteady on his feet’, and a breathalyser found him to be nearly four times over the drink drive limit with 139mcg of alcohol in 100ml breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs.

Mr Dance pleaded guilty to drink driving, with his defence lawyer telling the court he had ‘struggled with alcohol’ for years, but had no previous convictions.

The case has been adjourned so a psychiatric assessment could be made.

He was given an interim ban on driving until December 20 when he will be sentenced.
