Samuel Eto'o has turned down the chance to sign for Ajax after the deadline for an agreement passed at 6pm on Wednesday night. 

The 33-year-old free agent is awaiting offers from Everton and Liverpool who maintain an interest in Monaco's Radamel Falcao. 

Liverpool are willing to pay the £10m loan fee for the Colombian but he prefers Real Madrid.

Rodgers told the club's website recently, www.liverpoolfc.com: 'We would still like to do some business.

'Across the board we still want to add a little bit more depth to what we have.'

Liverpool have already signed international strikers Rickie Lambert and Divock Origi this summer, although the latter is to be loaned back to former club Lille.
