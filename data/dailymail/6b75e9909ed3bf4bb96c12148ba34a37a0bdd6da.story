Their bodies are considered to feature exactly what many women desire when looking in the mirror.

But Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian 'lied' about getting their amazing figures from over-the-counter diet pills, according to a $5million lawsuit against the sisters by four angry customers.

The Keeping up with the Kardashians stars from Los Angeles, California, were hit by the class-action complaint on Thursday by the customers in New York over their endorsement of QuickTrim.

They claim the main ingredient of the weight-loss products’ formula is caffeine, which is not an effective or safe diet treatment according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, reported TMZ.

The customers say they simply would not have brought the products if they were aware of this - and claim the testimonies of the Kardashian sisters who have endorsed the product are completely false.

The diet product is ‘marketed by the defendants as a clinically proven formula that will increase metabolism, curb appetite and promote weight loss,’ according to the court filing in Manhattan.

‘In reality, QuickTrim’s main ingredient is a large dose of caffeine, which the FDA has determined is not a safe or effective treatment for weight control,’ the lawsuit said, reported the New York Post.

The majority of adverts for QuickTrim, which produces a wide range of weight loss products, feature photos of the Kardashian sisters ‘in a bikini or other revealing attire’, according to the lawsuit.

They suggest this is deliberately misleading. The Kardashian sisters often tweet about the products, which has a considerable effect as Kim alone has more than 13,500,000 followers.

She can make thousands of dollars from tweets she makes for advertisers. 'Starting QuickTrim today,' she tweeted last June. 'It's officially summer. I want to really get in fab shape!'

She has previously featured for many health and fitness brands, such as Skechers Shape-Up shoes. Spokesmen for the Kardashians did not immediately respond to a MailOnline comment request.
