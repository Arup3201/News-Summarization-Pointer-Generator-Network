Wilfried Zaha has suffered more disappointment in his season of frustration after he withdrew from England's Under-21 squad for Monday's Euro 2015 qualifier with Wales.

The Manchester United forward has an unspecified muscle problem in his leg and after consultations with Zaha and his club medical staff, it was decided to scratch him from the list.

Zaha was not eligible for the squad Gareth Southgate will take to the Toulon Tournament next week as he is too old but the Under-21 head coach is disappointed the campaign has ended this way for a player who has struggled to get regular starts either at United or Cardiff, where he went on loan.

Precaution: Manager Gareth Southgate said the winger has been carrying a knock and didn't want to risk it

Southgate said: 'Zaha has been carrying something and we decided it was best not to aggravate it. He would have only been available for this one game anyway.

'He goes back to Manchester United there with a new manager. It has been a very bitty season for him. He's now played in the Premier League, he had not done that before this season.

'When he went to Manchester United everyone was expecting a massive impact but it was a step up from where he had been playing.

'I think part of being successful as a young player is resilience and how you respond to knockbacks and success. No-one's career is a constant upward line.'

Southgate added: 'You have peaks and troughs and it is how you deal with those that are key. Ultimately you have to love football, you have to want to train and improve.

'If all those things are in place you will come through those hurdles and come back stronger. But it is not easy.'
