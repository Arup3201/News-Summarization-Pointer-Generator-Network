Top Royal Mail investor: Chris Hohn of combative hedge fund TIC

A combative hedge fund has snapped up more shares in Royal Mail than any other investor, it was disclosed last night.

The Government had hoped to sell shares to pension funds and long-term investors during the flotation, which was one of the largest since the days of Margaret Thatcher.

But Royal Mail documents show that The Children’s Investment Fund, which is run by Chris Hohn who was once dubbed the 'locust' for his aggressive tactics, has built up a 5 per cent holding in the company – making it the largest single shareholder.

The revelation will increase 
pressure on ministers over whether the firm was substantially 
undervalued before its sell earlier this month.

Shares in the firm were up 11.25p at 
510.25p in early trading today - some 55 per cent above the float price 
of 330p, but off their all-time high to date of 538.5p.

Any
investor who owns more than 3 per cent has to declare their holding. 
TCI – run by Mr Hohn and one of the initial 300 institutions to get 
shares at 330p in the float – is the first to bridge the threshold.

The holding of 58m shares is worth £280million, although it is not known at what price the fund bought its extra postal shares.

The fund has picked fights with governments and companies across the world in pursuit of higher returns.

Mr
Hohn was once described as a ‘locust’ after helping to remove the boss 
of Deutsche Börse, a German firm that was trying to buy the London Stock
Exchange.

He is also one of the UK’s leading philanthropists, having given an estimated £800m to children’s charities since 2003.

Surge: The price of shares in the Royal Mail has soared since the government sold off more than half the firm at £3.30 earlier this month

Labour's shadow trade minister Ian Murray said: 'David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale has seen the vast majority of shares going to big money investors in the City while the taxpayer is left short changed.

'The Tory-led Government claimed that the sale would prioritise long-term investors but serious questions will be asked on whether this is the case, not least given the huge volume of trades in Royal Mail shares which we have seen in the first days of trading running into hundreds of millions.

'Thanks to David Cameron, taxpayers have been left short changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families across Britain are facing a cost of living crisis.'

The Government has been slammed for selling Royal Mail at such a low level, when analysts were saying it should be valued at more than £5billion. 

Business Secretary Vince Cable will appear before MPs next month to answer questions over why shares were sold by the government at £3.30 but have since soared to more than £5.

He will appear alongside Lazard, one of the banks advising the Government.

Mr Cable has claimed threats of strike action forced ministers to cut value of Royal Mail on the eve of its sell-off.

In a letter to the Business Select Committee on Friday he said potential investors pulled out of the deal before the flotation as unions vowed to ballot for industrial action.

Grilling: Business Secretary Vince Cable is to face questions from MPs next month on whether Royal Mail was sold off on the cheap

Bankers at Goldman Sachs, UBS and Lazards handling the sale persuaded ministers not to increase the offer price above £3.30, fearing it could hit demand, Mr Cable claimed.

He said that earlier in the preparation for the sell-off during the summer, the threat of strikes by Royal Mail workers left some buyers ready to pull out.

In early August a list of 20 potential investors was drawn up but later that month it became clear that a new pay agreement with postal workers was no longer achievable before the sell-off.

It meant the Communication Workers Union (CWU) were likely to ballot for strike action at or around the time of the privatisation.
