Twitter could become the latest high profile company to come under scrutiny for its tax arrangements after reporting UK profits of less than £100,000.

The abbreviated accounts of the company, which is tipped to float on the New York stock market for £7billion, indicate that the company may be using corporate structures in Ireland to close deals with UK advertisers.

Such a set up, similar to a controversial arrangement adopted by internet giant Google, would mean that any profits from the sales would not be subject to tax.

Google faced much criticism for claiming to 'close' its deals in Ireland.

Although there was no suggestion that Google had broken any laws, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee Margaret Hodge, concluded that its behaviour on tax was 'devious, calculated and, in my view, unethical'.

She had received evidence from several tax whistleblowers.

Profits remaining in the company after tax are listed in Twitter's abbreviated accounts at £92,408 for 2012 compared with £16,500 from the previous year.

Twitter's London headquarters would not confirm whether UK sales were completed in Ireland, according to The Guardian.

It said that 100 people are currently employed in its Dublin office compared to 60 in London.

According to The Guardian, Twitter UK's parent company Twitter International is registered in Ireland and much of its non-US business is based there, with unlimited Irish companies set up to avoid having to file accounts.

A spokesman told the company: 'Since Twitter UK opened in 2011 we have been steadily building our team, focusing on promoting great uses of Twitter by all elements of UK society.'

It was estimated in January by research group eMarketer that Twitter took $288million (£193million) in advertising revenue.

They predicted that the company would take $545million this year.

Companies with fewer than 50 staff, turnover of less than £6.5million or a balance sheet under £3.26million are allowed to file abbreviated accounts in Britain.
