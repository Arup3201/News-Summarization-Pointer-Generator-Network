A shopping centre has installed a new 'overtaking lane' for speedy shoppers after receiving a letter from a schoolgirl grumbling about ‘slow walkers’.

Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield received the note from Chloe Nash-Lowe, 10, moaning about her biggest bug-bear and as a result they have installed a fast lane for those in a hurry.

The schoolgirl wrote to the shopping complex as part of a school project asking if anything could be done to solve the problem, listing a whole host of reasons why sluggish shoppers should be sped up.

She asked: 'Will you ever tell people not to walk slow? If you do this for me I will be delighted – please do it.'

However, Chloe had no idea that they would enforce a traffic flow system to tackle the problem, and was thrilled to hear they are putting her plan into action.

Chloe, from Aughton, South Yorkshire, said: 'It makes me really cross when people take my time up by walking really slowly.

'They just get in the way - you get stuck behind them and you can't move past them.

'With an overtaking lane, people can walk slowly if they want to but if you want to walk faster you can. Everyone can walk at whatever speed they want.'

Meadowhall Centre Director Darren Pearce believed it was a great idea and responded to the letter, before meeting with Chloe to discuss her suggestion.

'I want to thank Chloe for taking the time to write in and share her views with us – we love to hear feedback from our younger shoppers,' said Mr Pearce.

'The Meadowhall team liked Chloe’s idea so much that we have decided to trial an over-taking lane for fast walkers on the malls – helping them to get where they want to be on time – let’s see how it goes!'

Chloe said: 'When my teacher, Mr Lawson, asked me to write a letter about something I’d like to change, I never thought it would actually happen.

Chloe’s mum Rebecca Lowe, said: 'Chloe’s always giving me feedback when she goes to places so I wasn’t surprised to hear she wasn’t happy about not being able to walk fast enough around Meadowhall.

'It’s great that they’re taking her idea further and putting it forward into the shopping centre.

'She loves to have a moan, I think she’s a bit of a grumpy old woman at heart'
