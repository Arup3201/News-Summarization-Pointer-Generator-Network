A Connecticut police officer was found not guilty Wednesday of violating the civil rights of a man who video showed being stomped and kicked by three cops who'd just tasered him into submission.

Clive Higgins was the only officer to plead not guilty in the 2011 incident in which drug dealer Orlando Lopez-Soto was seen in footage being brutalized as he lay face down in the grass following a car chase with police.

A jury said Wednesday that Higgins, who's seen in video arriving to the scene sometime after fellow cops Joseph Lawlor and Elson Morales before getting in his own licks, had not violated Lopez-Soto's civil rights.

Off the hook: Higgins, an officer in Bridgeport since 2002, had faced up to 10 years behind bars had he been convicted.

Higgins, an officer in Bridgeport since 2002, had faced up to 10 years behind bars had he been convicted, NBC Connecticut reports.

A video showed police officers kicking and Lopez-Soto after he was shot with a stun gun in Beardsley Park in 2011 following a car chase.

Morales and Lawlor pleaded guilty in June to depriving Lopez-Soto of his civil rights. Both agreed to resign from the police department.

Lopez-Soto is serving five years in prison after pleading guilty to drug and gun charges in 2012.

Prosecutors said Morales used his stun gun a second time after Lopez-Soto was effectively incapacitated and Lawlor kicked him several times.

The city recently settled the case by agreeing to pay $198,000 to Lopez-Soto.

The victim said in his lawsuit that he was motionless on the ground and not resisting when the officers kicked and stomped him. 

He said he suffered pain, a bad cut to his lip that left a scar, body and face bruises and a fracture to his hand.

Lawlor wrote in a police report that Lopez-Soto struggled with officers after falling to the ground when Morales zapped him with a stun gun.

Lawlor said Lopez-Soto was wearing a gun holster on his belt, and officers later found a loaded handgun and drugs in Lopez-Soto’s van.

All three officers seen in the video, which surfaced in 2013, were placed on paid administrative duty pending a police internal affairs investigation.

NAACP leaders at the time called on police officials to arrest and fire the officers.Lopez-Soto pleaded guilty to drug and gun charges in July 2012 and was sentenced to five years in prison.
