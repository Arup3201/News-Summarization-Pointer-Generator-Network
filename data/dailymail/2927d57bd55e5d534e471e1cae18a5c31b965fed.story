Two months after an abused pit bull was found almost beaten and starved to death in Quincy, near Boston, police say they have a suspect in the case.

Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, appeared in New Britain, Connecticut, 
Superior Court this afternoon and was placed into the custody of Quincy 
cops following a brief hearing.

Czerkawski was initially called a 'person of interest' in the case but Quincy police said after his New Britain court appearance that he will be charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty. Each count carries a maximum 5-year prison sentence if convicted.

A translator was needed because Czerkawski speaks only Polish.

Caught: Radoslaw Czerkawski is being held on a fugitive from justice charge in New Britain, Connecticut. Police in Massachusetts believe he could be involved with the dog abuse case

'We sent detectives down to speak with him about his involvement with the case,' said Quincy Police Captain John Dougan.

He was found at a La Quinta hotel last Wednesday morning, police said, and appeared in New Britain Superior Court earlier today to start the rendition process back to Massachusetts.

The charge against Czerkawski is the first significant break in the investigation.

He is set to be arraigned tomorrow in Quincy District Court on a charge of misleading a police investigation. Other charges are 'possible,' police added.

Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries

'We have a party that’s charged with 
misleading a police investigation, and we’re going to send detectives to
talk to him about their involvement with the case,' Quincy police Capt.
John Dougan said this morning.

Cops
have spent weeks following the trail of people who have owned the dog, 
which had been given away at least once on Craigslist’s animal-adoption 
pages by a woman who owned the dog last year.

'Essentially,
we have a person of interest who has knowledge of the case, and 
detectives are going to be questioning this person of interest,' Dougan 
said. 'Hopefully they’ll answer some questions to put the pieces of the 
puzzle together.'

Despite 
naming Czerkawski as a person of interest in the Puppy Doe case, it's 
not clear just what authorities believe his connection is to the dog.

Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured

Police
and much of the public have been on the hunt for the suspect since the 
female pit bull was found on August 31st close to a local playground.

Quincy,
Massachusetts Police, the Animal Rescue League of Boston and the Office
of the District Attorney for the Norfolk District in Massachusetts have
been investigating.

'Please
be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify
and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture 
of Puppy Doe. It is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty 
could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving 
other animals or perhaps vulnerable people' Norfolk District Attorney 
Michael Morrissey said in a statement.

The two-year-old dog, found near a 
Massachusetts play park, had been beaten, burned, starved and stabbed in
the eyes in what was described as 'medieval' torture

Animal
rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull, 
including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue, as the worst
they had ever seen.

Veterinarians
at the Animal Rescue League of Boston who treated the dog said that she
was emaciated and weighed half of what would be expected for a two year
old.

Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly

The dog’s tongue had been split on 
purpose. She had also been burned on the nose, stabbed in the eye, and 
beaten so severely that she could barely walk. The pit bull had to be 
put down due to the extent of her injuries.

When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light.

Vet
Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that 
she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's 
body.

'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she said. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.'

The
vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood 
immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.'

Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart

Public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the Quincy police department in tracking the perpetrator, along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward.

The Animal Rescue League of Boston offered $5,000, followed by the California-based Animal Legal Defense League put up $2,000. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered up another $5,000, and Second Chance Rescue out of New York raised $11,000 for information.

The Animal Rescue League raised also raised $35,000 additionally to be put toward the investigation of this and other animal abuse cases.

The story has prompted Facebook groups that have become the sites of a tremendous outpouring of outrage and grief, and resulted in a vigil held for 'Puppy Doe.'

In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep

Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered

Although there was no evidence of 
sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases,
the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly.

Despite the pain and 
suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at 
the rescue center said she was sweet natured.

'Within
hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She 
experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr 
Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she 
would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down.

As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board.
