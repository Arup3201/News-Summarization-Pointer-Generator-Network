Former Premier League stars Gary Neville and Stan Collymore were involved in a Twitter spat following Diego Costa's controversial booking for a dive during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Burnley on Monday night.

Former Manchester United defender Neville, now a pundit on Sky Sports, claimed every player had gone to ground to win a foul in the Premier League era.

But ex-Liverpool striker Collymore, now a radio presenter and commentator, challenged Neville to find footage of him diving - promising to quit broadcasting if he managed it. 

Clipped: Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton appeared to have made contact with Costa

Contact: Replays showed he was brought down by the left hand of Heaton

Penalised: Costa was wrongfully booked as Michael Oliver thought he dived

Costa was cautioned by referee Michael Oliver for simulation after going down under the challenge of Burnley keeper Tom Heaton - TV replays showed he had been fouled and the visitors should have been awarded a penalty. 

However, Collymore insisted the Chelsea striker dived but added that 'most pundits' would say it was a spot-kick, as indeed Neville did. The former defender went on to say on Sky Sports that 'every player' would have gone to ground at some stage during their career.

The debate escalated on Twitter after the match as Collymore insisted that he had never gone down to gain an advantage.

Eventually, he challenged the Sky pundit to find footage of him diving, saying he would walk away from radio and TV if he did.

Neville returned with a counter challenge, if he found the former England striker had dived during his career he then must wear a Manchester United top in Liverpool.

Neville tweeted: 'As I said every player. Give me a few days or so. Need a sky anorak in the archives? Anyone?'

However, an initial trawl of footage by Sportsmail has not managed to unearth any Collymore dives.

Over to you, Gary.
