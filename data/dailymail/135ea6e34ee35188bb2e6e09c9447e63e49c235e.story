A serial-killer's nephew who was first arrested when he was six has become his family’s fifth convicted murderer.

Diamond Blair, 37, from Kansas City, has been found guilty of murder in a 2009 robbery attempt.

Blair is a member of one of Kansas City’s most notorious criminal families.

His uncle is notorious serial killer Terry Blair who raped and killed at least seven women.

Terry Blair’s mother was convicted of killing her drug-dealing boyfriend in 1989.

One of his brothers was executed for another killing and a half brother was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and other charges.

Last week a Jackson County jury found Diamond Blair guilty of murdering 22-year-old Montague Kevin Ashline on June 24, 2009.

They also found him guilty of robbery and armed criminal action in Ashline's death  outside a Kansas City apartment complex.

The Kansas City Star reports Diamond Blair is already serving 23 years in prison for other convictions.

Between the ages of 12 and 16, Diamond Blair appeared in juvenile court for assault, stealing cars and escaping the court’s McCune School for Boys.

Before turning 16 the newspaper reported that he was charged in four robberies, a kidnapping and weapons violations. 

A judge certified him to stand trial as an adult and sent him to jail.

But his reign of terror continued behind bars and Diamond Blair and two others sodomized a 15-year-old boy.

His family have committed a string of murders.

Blair's uncle Terry Blair was described as being a cold, 
calculating killer determined to kill as many women who worked as 
prostitutes as he could during his trial.

At the time of his September 2004 arrest, Terry Blair was on parole after 
serving 21 years for the 1982 murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, 
Angela Monroe, who was the mother of two of his children.

Terry Blair's mother Janice Miller was charged with murder twice and convicted once for shooting and killing her drug-dealing boyfriend in 1989.

She was sentenced to probation. The mother-of-ten raised her children in what Terry Blair later described to a parole officer as poverty.

She went no further in school than ninth grade and suffered from mental illness, court records show.

One of Terry Blair's brothers, Walter Blair Jr, was charged in a murder-for-hire scheme and was eventually executed. 

His half brother, Clifford Miller, was convicted in the 1992 abduction of a woman from a bar.

He was sentenced to two life sentences plus 240 years for charges including kidnapping and forcible sodomy.
