All action: Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe broke off an interview when he saw a taxi driver allegedly being robbed, jumped into the cab and soon afterwards arrested a suspect

It is never a bright idea to commit a crime in front of a policeman, let alone Britain’s most senior officer.

Perhaps the brazen yobs who robbed a taxi driver in broad daylight on a busy London street presumed that Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was too busy giving a radio interview to do anything about it.

But they hadn’t reckoned on the steely determination of the Commissioner who broke off mid-sentence to give chase to the gang, leaping in the victim’s minicab to pursue them yesterday.

In a scene described by stunned locals as like something out of a film, the 56-year-old Commissioner once dubbed a ‘crime-busting machine’, sprang into action arresting a 19-year-old suspect within minutes, while his bodyguard collared a 17-year-old accomplice.

The incident in Tottenham, North London was captured on tape at 11.20am yesterday as the Metropolitan Police boss was taking part in a pre-recorded interview with BBC London 94.9 Drivetime presenter Eddie Nestor.

As Sir Bernard was talking about police cuts, a taxi slowed to a halt beside him and four thugs leapt out and ran off to the fury of the driver who called out for help, saying in broken English: ‘I’m a cab driver.

‘I put £20 here (gesturing to the dashboard). Is no pay me and the money is gone.’

Sir Bernard responded: ‘Do you know where they’ve gone?’ adding: ‘I’m going to go with you.’

The Commissioner then leapt into the victim’s minicab to look for the suspects before continuing the pursuit in a squad car, arresting a 19-year-old suspect on suspicion of theft minutes later.

A 17-year-old man was also apprehended at nearby Bruce Grove train station on suspicion of theft, handling stolen goods and making off without payment by an accompanying officer who followed him on foot.

Afterwards the driver, who gave his name as Mohammed, told the BBC he didn’t know who the Commissioner was, but described him as a ‘very good, very kind’ man who came to his aid after passengers stole £20 from his dashboard before running away without paying the fare.

He said: ‘When I see the police, I ask the police ‘please can you stop the guys?’

One local shop worker who witnessed the chase said: ‘I thought they were filming for some sort of TV programme - it looked like it could’ve been staged.

‘There was a cab that had pulled up across the road and I could also see the guys who were filming.

‘I went outside and saw two police men. Another policeman, who was in plain clothes, had grabbed a young guy outside the station and had him pinned up against the wall.’

Another witness, who asked not to be named, recalled: ‘We saw people running and guys with camera - I thought they were making a movie.’

Quick decision: Sir Bernard leaps into the taxi in Tottenham, north London, to help look for the suspects

Yesterday the top policeman whose motto is ‘total policing’ told of his pride at making an arrest in every rank he has held since becoming an officer in 1979, joking that it was a ‘disgrace’ he hadn’t felt a collar in almost three years as the Met boss.

He told the BBC: ‘The important thing for today, at least for me, is that I have made an arrest at every rank as a police officer, so as chief constable at Merseyside, but never as commissioner, and I have been here three years - that’s very slack, it’s a disgrace, but today we have put it right.’

Sir Bernard, who has been nicknamed Eliot Ness- the legendary lawman in prohibition America whose team of Untouchables brought down Al Capone- is known as an all action Commissioner who is equally at home patrolling on horseback as behind a desk.

In 2006 when he was chief constable of Merseyside Police, he sprinted after a suspected drink-driver in Liverpool after spotting him from his chauffeur-driven car.

A Met Police spokesman said: ‘Sir Bernard was in Tottenham High Road at the junction of Bruce Grove recording an interview with BBC London Radio, when a mini cab stopped and the driver called for police help.

‘Four males were seen to jump out of the vehicle and run off, closely followed by an officer who was with the Commissioner.

‘A 17-year old youth was arrested inside Bruce Grove Rail Station on suspicion of theft, handling and making off without payment.

‘Descriptions were circulated and the Commissioner got into a police car which arrived at the scene and went to look for the outstanding suspects.

‘In nearby Napier Road, one of the suspects, a 19-year old man, was seen and arrested on suspicion of theft and making off without payment.’

Last night the two suspects were currently being held in police stations in north London.
