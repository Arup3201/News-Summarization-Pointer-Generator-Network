Everton manager Roberto Martinez has said it is vital David Moyes keeps his backroom team at Real Sociedad to help him adapt to an overseas culture.

Moyes was criticised by Sir Alex Ferguson among others for making immediate wholesale changes to his staff at Manchester United.

Assistant manager Mike Phelan and first-team coach Rene Meulensteen left immediately and Moyes was unable to tap into their knowledge of how the club worked as he chose instead to bring Jimmy Lumsden, Steve Round, Phil Neville and Chris Woods with him from Everton.

He has already failed to persuade Neville to work alongside him again in La Liga.

Martinez - who succeeded Moyes at Everton and has a good insight into his methods of working - thinks local expertise will be key in San Sebastian if the Scot is to be a success.

'From a football point of view, David knows everything he needs to. The only thing he has to get used to very quickly is that he isn't going to Spain, he is going to the Basque country,' said Martinez, the Premier League's only Spanish manager.

'It is a very special part of Spain – the Basque people use football to represent their culture. They have their own language, and that is huge.

'I think it is impossible for a Spanish person to learn Basque, never mind for a British man.

'Having the amount of staff that David Moyes will have from the country and from the club is going to be very helpful, and it's going to be a perfect bridge for the players straight away. I am sure the staff will help communicate his ideas.

'He will need to embrace the culture, but will be allowed to bring in a really solid footballing philosophy that will give the club exactly what they need. I think that's where the beauty of the challenge lies.''

Martinez feels if Moyes can adapt off-the-field, Sociedad will be a perfect fit in football terms.

'I don't think David will have any problem with the actual football side of the job because he is a very knowledgeable manager,' he said.

'I think the fans will take to David Moyes way of working, his honesty and values as a human being. I can see that as being a very successful partnership.

'Sociedad have a strong core of players and it is the kind of dressing-room that are ready to work, listen and be guided by the manager.

Martinez has heaped praise on his Everton predecessor following his appointment at Real Sociedad 

'Tactically, it won't be a big challenge as there are not that many styles in La Liga. In the Premier League you have got four or five different styles, in Spain everyone tries to play very much the same.'

Sociedad qualifed for the Champions League last season but are currently struggling against relegation. The club has a recent tradition of having British managers and players including Chris Coleman, John Toshack and John Aldridge.

The Everton manager was speaking at “An Audience with Roberto Martinez” where fans and sponsors were able to hear him answer questions at the Titanic Hotel in Liverpool.

He also revealed that midfielder Gareth Barry faces an x-ray on Monday to determine the damage of an ankle injury sustained after a bad tackle by Sunderland's Jordi Gomez on Sunday.

Martinez hopes the former England midfielder will be able to return in a fortnight.
