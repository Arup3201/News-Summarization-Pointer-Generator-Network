Flying under the influence: Flight attendant Nancy Bray, 58, was arrested Tuesday trying to board a plane for work with three times the legal amount of alcohol in her system

A 58-year-old Delta flight attendant had three times the legal amount of alcohol in her system when she tried to board a flight this week for work.

Nancy Bray was scheduled to work a flight from Blue Grass Airport to Detroit Tuesday when medics were called to help her after she got sick, according to court papers.

Police arrested her when she registered a .258 blood alcohol level and they found prescription drugs on her not in their 'original container'.

Bray's arrest delayed the flight by two hours.

According to Kentucky state law, the maximum blood alcohol level is 0.04 per cent and crew members are not allowed to consume alcohol eight hours before a flight.

They are not allowed to fly under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Following Bray's arrest, Delta issued a statement on the incident, saying they would cooperate with law enforcement's investigation.

'Delta expects consummate professionalism from all parties who are entrusted with the care of transport of our customers,' the company said.

Passengers at the airport on Wednesday were shocked to hear about the flight attendant's arrest.

'My first thought was that's amazing, they know what the rules are and I feel sorry for the passengers that were unnecessarily delayed and had to be re-booked on other flights,â€
