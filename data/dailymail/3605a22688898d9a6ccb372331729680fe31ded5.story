YouTube sensation Bas van Velzen has shown off his outstanding shooting technique once again, however this time he has decided to go up against a goalkeeper, Mitchell Molenhuis.

Van Velzen became an internet star when a video emerged of the Dutchman curling the ball into an empty net at the end of 2014.

However viewers of the video questioned if he would be able to score from distance against an actual goalkeeper, rather than a friend who looked like they were just placed in the goal.

Van Velzen has silenced his doubters by hitting a number of free-kicks into the top corner of the goal while the goalkeeper is seen clutching at thin air. 

His first hit video, which he named 'Best knuckleballs & Curve shots from 2014', has over 4.5million views on YouTube.
