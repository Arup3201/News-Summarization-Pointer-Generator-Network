A Chinese shopping mall has installed a plus-sized, women-only zone to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking.

The zone, marked with a sign reading: 'Respectfully reserved for women', is situated outside the World Metropolis (Dashijiedaduhui) centre in Dalian in north-east China's Liaoning province.

It features ten parking spaces which are painted pink and around 30 centimetres wider than normal.

It is the latest in a string of women-only zones to have emerged in car parks across China, where the middle class is bulging and more people have the income necessary to buy and drive vehicles.

Other places to have introduced them include Wanxiang-Tiancheng shopping centre in Shijiazhuang city, Hebei province, and a building materials mall in Tianjin, northern China.

The pink-ringed parking spaces have sparked debate in China, which officially embraces gender equality but where old-fashioned sexism is rife in reality.

The World Metropolis, situated in the centre of the northern port city of Dalian, is one of thousands of other retail complexes to have sprouted across the country as part of a vast urbanisation drive.

It features dozens of chain clothing stores, fast food franchises, glass lifts, a cinema, and Starbucks, which has become a favourite hangout of China's new middle class.

According to its management, the plus-sized, women-only spaces were created outside its main entrance after female drivers had trouble parking in the standard basement slots.

'I think this is very convenient,' user Yong Mei told AFP. 'Other parking spaces are too narrow.'

She added: 'It's not gender biased. It's just that women have a few issues with vision when parking.'

But the spaces have provoked outrage on social media - with many accusing the shopping centre of sexism and cliched thinking.

'This is supposed to respect women, but actually it's an insult,' said an unnamed woman.

Today, the mall's manager, Yang Hongjun, defended the larger pink-ringed parking spots, deeming them 'practical'.

'We just wanted to make things easier for women, who make up most of our customers,' she said.

'It's not an insult to women at all. If their parking spaces are larger, it's only for practical reasons. It doesn't mean that women drive less well than men.'

However, the policy appears to be at odds with statistics on driving fatalities. A study titled 'Basic Characteristics 
of Road Traffic Deaths in China' published last January, revealed there 
were more than 67,000 people killed in road traffic crashes, including 
parking incidents, in 2009.

One
 of the significant risk factors was gender. But contrary to the 
apparent belief of the shopping mall planners, men have a far higher 
risk of crashing then women.

In the study, fatal crashes by male drivers were more than three times than that of female drivers.

Lower car insurance quotes for women than men also suggests that women are safer drivers, regardless of reputation.

Officially, China proclaims the sexes equal in keeping with Communist principles, and revolutionary Mao Zedong once said that 'women hold up half the sky'.

But conservative attitudes remain deeply ingrained, and women are conspicuous by their rarity in the upper echelons of Chinese politics and the ruling party, dominated by men in black suits.

One online poster on the Dalian car park said: 'The two most dangerous things in the world are men who cook and women who drive.'

Manufacturers' advertisements in the world's biggest auto market are invariably aimed at male buyers, and a man at the mall, Wu Zhicun, said: 'Women don't really know how to park a car.'

'The few times I've come close to crashing was basically with women driving the other car,' he added.

'I've noticed they're a bit rough at the wheel, they only look forwards, too often they ignore their mirrors.'

The latest Chinese controversy echoes a series of microblog posts Beijing police made last year advising women on driving techniques.

These included not wearing high heels, releasing the handbrake before setting off and not panicking if they suddenly realise they are going the wrong way.

'Some women drivers lack a sense of direction, and while driving a car, they often hesitate and are indecisive about which road they should take,' read one of the entries on the police department's verified microblog.

Another featured a cartoon depicting a confrontation between a police officer and a woman driving a vehicle shaped like a large red high-heel shoe.

According to a World Health Organization 
estimate in March 2013, globally males are more likely to be involved in
 accidents than females, and 77 percent of all road traffic deaths occur
 among men.

Even so, for some, the women-only parking places amounted to discrimination against male drivers.

'It's always women who enjoy privileges!' complained one. 'Men have become the weaker sex.'

The news comes just months after similar spaces were introduced for female drivers at another shopping centre in Seoul, South Korea.
