Almost 18 months have passed since Kevin Pietersen uttered that memorably self-pitying remark: 'It's tough being me.' At the time, he was threatening to retire from Test cricket, alienating the bulk of England's cricketers and secretly texting members of the South Africa team with insults aimed at his captain, Andrew Strauss.

Before that turbulent August was done, the eminently decent Strauss would retire from the Test arena, Pietersen would be temporarily banished from the England team and English cricket would be in a state of rancorous turmoil.

Yet still there were those who defended him; showbiz back-slappers and starstruck flatterers for the most part.

Box office: But Kevin Pietersen's powers may be on the wane

'Genius obeys its own rules,' they told us. 'It's what being KP is all about.' Or, as Pietersen himself portentously put it: 'I am who I am.'

At the close of 2012, England's new young captain Alastair Cook would utter this fervent prayer: 'Time, hopefully, will be a healer and we will be able to move on.' Does that situation ring the faintest of bells? Well, it should because poisonous hostility is once more the order of the day and the usual suspect is at its centre. Once again, a senior figure in the England hierarchy has had his fill of our Kev.

Another decent man, the coach Andy Flower, apparently finds himself unable to work with his most accomplished player. As ever, the details are obscure.

Flower is saying little, while Pietersen is practising his enigmatic shrug, leaving his faithful luvvies to leak their loaded version of events. But as the artless lobbying intensifies, so the bruised and battered English game sinks a little more deeply into the mire.

It is as if we had learned nothing from the Strauss Affair, nor from that shameful business of January 2009 when, as England captain, Pietersen attempted a miserably maladroit coup against the England coach Peter Moores, as a result of which Moores was sacked and Pietersen lost a job he should never have been given.

Here we should enter the standard caveat. At his best, Pietersen is a batsman of princely command and imagination. His shot-making is gloriously audacious and, when the mood is upon him, he can tailor the game to his own talents. It should also be said that those gifts have not been much in evidence these past few weeks. His faithful supporters protest that he scored more runs than any other England batsmen in the recent series.

Dilemma: England may be forced to choose between the civilised eminence of Andy Flower and the simmering selfregard of Kevin Pietersen

Perfectly true but 294 at a pauper's average of 29.40 scarcely suggests wholesale plunder. And the nature of his performances, those distracted dismissals from airy wafts, carried hints of a 33-year-old whose powers may be on the wane.

Naturally, the true believers will hear none of this. Why, Michael Vaughan wants him appointed vice-captain, on the grounds that he would flourish with a taste of responsibility. But if the vice-captaincy could work such wonders, then the captaincy itself would surely transform England's fortunes. Recalling Pietersen's previous tenancy, which lasted for precisely three Test matches, I doubt that the experiment will come to pass.

In any case, we should do well to remember his history. He flounced out of his native South Africa, following a bogus tiff over the quota system. He incited ructions at Nottinghamshire, which led to captain Jason Gallian hurling his kit from the dressing-room balcony. He made a peremptory departure from Hampshire, having discovered it was a long way from his home in Chelsea: 'Geographically, it doesn't work,' he explained.

And his departure from the England captaincy provoked one of the more earthshaking explosions in the long and frequently turbulent history of English cricket. The factor which all these altercations had in common, as his chums will readily testify, is that Pietersen was in no way to blame, he was always an innocent bystander, it was invariably someone else's fault. Just as it is in the present spat with Andy Flower.

The ham-fisted propagandists are already at work; we may sacrifice a coach but a genius is irreplaceable; KP is the victim of an Establishment conspiracy; why, I have even seen it suggested that we cannot lose Pietersen as he is 'box office', as if the England team should be selected on television ratings.

Well, the saga has run its course. If we really are forced to choose between the civilised eminence of Flower and the simmering selfregard of Pietersen, there is no choice to be made. Pietersen should be directed towards the Indian Premier League, where so much of his fortune has been made, and England should be free to follow a new, saner course. Cook's prayer was admirable, yet misplaced. For where KP is concerned, nobody moves on. They simply hold their breath and await the next eruption.

Jagerbomber: Chris Smalling in ill-advised fancy dress outfit

Even by the standards of modern footballers, Chris Smalling's fancy dress caper was a beauty. Hindsight may be easy but did nobody raise an eyebrow when he cried: 'Look, folks! I'm a suicide bomber'? At any rate, it was a real tester for the 'representatives' of the Manchester United defender. And they were magnificently equal to the task. 'He dressed in a costume consisting of empty bottles of Jagermeister and cans of Red Bull strapped to his chest in an attempted comedy play on the popular Jagerbomb drinks,' they explained. It seemed impossible to overhaul Smalling in the terminally tasteless stakes but his hired help brought it off.

A man of courage puts football's mob to shame

Two apparently unconnected images offered food for thought in a stormy sporting week.

One was of the former Aston Villa player, Thomas Hitzlsperger, relaxed and smiling after announcing that he is gay. The other was of a neanderthal section of Tottenham supporters, faces contorted in mindless fury, screeching abuse at Theo Walcott as he was carried away from the Arsenal pitch with a serious knee injury.

Brave decision: Thomas Hitzlsperger

Hitzlsperger, with 52 caps for Germany, retired from the game last September. He says he was warned about the possibility of a hostile reaction to his revelation, so he felt able to come out only when his career was over. The points he makes are thoughtful and revealing.

'The perceived contradiction between playing football, the man's game, and being homosexual is nonsense,' he says. 'You hear the word "courage" a lot. That's nice to hear but it's part of the problem, of course. I sincerely hope we'll see the time when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances any more because it will be seen as totally normal that a sportsperson will speak about his homosexuality, the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends.'

Injury blow: Theo Walcott was ruled out for the season

Now, only the profoundly uncivilised could disagree with a word of that, which takes us back to that other image, the rabid mob at Emirates. Walcott had merely reminded opposing fans that Arsenal were leading by two goals to nil. Consider what such people - and their kindred spirits up and down the land - might have made of a player who was not only enormously talented but openly gay. The venom which such a man would attract is all too easily imagined.

Mercifully, I believe that the tide is turning and that homophobia disgusts the decent majority, who take the view that a footballer's sexuality is of no concern to anybody but himself. Yet the first active player to come out will face problems.

At first, he will be reviled by knuckle-draggers around the country. But, ultimately, enlightenment will dawn. It will take patience, determination and something more. It will take courage. While he may not care for the word, it is a quality which Thomas Hitzlsperger possesses in abundance.

P.S.

Ian Holloway, Millwall's new manager, has always seemed a cheery, uncomplicated fellow. But look closely and you may discern the chip on his shoulder. He explains his failure to succeed in the Premier League with this spot of populist prattle: 'If I had a fair crack, with a budget as good as some, I believe I can do it. But I'm going to have to get there - I'm not one of these foreign fellas who comes in because he has known Jose Mourinho for 10 minutes.' One hesitates to call Holloway, of all people, a 'Little Englander'. But, sadly, the cap seems to fit.
