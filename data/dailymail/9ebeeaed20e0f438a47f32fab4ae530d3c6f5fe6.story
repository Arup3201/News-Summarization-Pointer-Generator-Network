Andre Schurrle isn't short of a bob or two, but the Chelsea man refuses to bow to property price pressure in London.

The Germany international, who is tipped to play a starring role for Joachim Low's side at this month's World Cup, moved to Stamford Bridge last summer.

Schurrle is believed to be on in the region of £70,000-a-week by the Blues, more than £3million-a-year, and enjoyed a decent first season in English football, but is yet to buy a house having been on the lookout.

All smiles: The Chelsea man is tipped for big things for Germany at this month's World Cup in Brazil

'I am still looking for a suitable property,' he told German daily Bild. 'In London, prices are constantly rising, but it really makes little sense to constantly pay the high rents.'

The 23-year-old is with the national squad before they travel to Brazil and admitted he enjoys being home.

'My mother is cooking my favourite dishes such as schnitzel with mashed potatoes,' he added.

'I feel safe with my parents. When I am in Ludwigshafen, I dwell mostly in my old room. I know the area, my buddy, my friends. And "Hotel Mama" is just the best.

'My mother then takes me from everything - make food, laundry.

'In London I have even a cleaning lady, but that is not the same.'
