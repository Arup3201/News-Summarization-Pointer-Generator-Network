One of the leading campaigners in the fight for justice for the Hillsborough victims has died aged 62.

Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son Kevin was one of the 96 Liverpool fans who perished in the 1989 tragedy, had been suffering from cancer.

It was her 24-year fight to get her son’s inquest verdict of accidental death overturned that is credited with leading to fresh hearings for those who died.

She established from witnesses at the Sheffield stadium that – despite the coroner’s assertion that all fans were dead by 3.15pm – Kevin was still alive and could have been saved.

She appealed to three different attorney generals for a new inquest, only to be rebuffed. Her case was also rejected by the European Court of Human Rights.

But a breakthrough came in September following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report.

The tireless campaigner defied doctors' expectations to 
attend what was her last public appearance at the Hillsborough memorial 
service at Anfield on Monday.

She was diagnosed with terminal 
cancer in October, but despite her ill-health she carried on her 
campaign and attended a hearing at London's Royal Courts of Justice in 
December when the original inquest verdicts were quashed.

Liverpool FC paid tribute to her, saying: '[Her appearance on Monday] was an act so typical of a mum who simply refused to accept defeat.

Speaking after the historic hearing, 
which she attended in a wheelchair, she thanked Attorney General Dominic
Grieve for being 'a man of his word' in pushing for the new inquests.

She said: 'I am glad we never gave up. It has been hard, but we wouldn't have been here today.

'I'd like a corporate manslaughter 
verdict in the inquest, it's the least for what they have done. God 
willing, I will be here, it has been a long wait to see justice. I am so
glad I could be here today to hear it for myself.'

Referring to the cover-up that 
shifted blame away from the authorities and on to the victims, she said:
'I can't forgive them the extremes they went to. Why didn't they just 
give us the truth?'

In a statement on the Liverpool website, the club paid tribute to her.

They wrote: '[Her appearance on Monday] was an act so typical of a mum who simply refused to accept defeat.

'Anne may not have survived to see 
ultimate justice for her son but her actions have played a significant 
part in ensuring that 96 families have moved closer to Hillsborough 
closure.'

The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev James Jones, said: ‘Anne was a woman of remarkable courage and determination. She had a strength and an energy that flowed from her love for Kevin. She will go down in history as one of the key people who brought to light the truth of the tragedy.’

Maria Eagle, MP for Liverpool Garston and Halewood, tweeted: 'So very sorry to hear about Anne Williams. She was an incredible inspirational woman. £RIP.'

Tom Watson MP tweeted: 'Goodbye Anne. You were loved.'

As recently as Monday, Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, paid tribute to Mrs Williams in the Liverpool Echo.

She said: 'We applaud Anne's tenacity
to draw on whatever reserves she has left to be here today - she is 
quite simply an inspiration.'

Other friends and well-wishers took 
to Twitter to pay tribute to the campaigner who seemed to embody the 
spirit of the families who fought for justice for almost 25 years.

Paul Mac wrote: 'Deepest sympathy to 
Anne's family a truly truly lovely woman and your with Kevin now Anne. 
We will never forget you x.'

Pp Corke said: 'A truly insperation 
Anne Williams. Every decent person on this planet has love and respect 
for long hard fight you fought Anne. Your with your Kevin now. Rest 
Anne. You av earned it. Lovely lady.'

Steve Monahan added: 'R.I.P Anne 
Williams. What a true fighter and a wonderful woman. What she has had to
endure for the last 24 years is a disgrace and it should never have 
been this long.

'But in the face of adversity she 
remained dignified and never gave up hope. If I'm half the parent she 
was when I have children I'll be doing well.YNWAx'.

Mrs Williams was an early chairman of 
the Hillsborough Justice Campaign and later independently established 
Hope For Hillsborough (For Justice) in an effort to secure a fresh 
inquest into her son's death.

She leaves behind two children, son Michael, 41, and daughter Sara ,33, and three grandchildren.
