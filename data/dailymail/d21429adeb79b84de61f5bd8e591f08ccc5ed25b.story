In the middle of the Salisbury Plain lies a ghost town, which is out of bounds to the public for most of the year.

But at Christmas, St Giles church in the village of Imber opens its doors for a rare Church service, allowing people the chance to access the town that has been Ministry of Defence property for 70 years.

On December 21, churchgoers were allowed to see the houses that are now used exclusively for military training during the fifth annual carol service in the 13th-century church.

Come All Ye Faithful: Some 250 people attended the service at St Giles church on Saturday, taking advantage of the short period that the MoD had declared the village open

Restricted: St Giles in Imber is normally barred from the public for all but a maximum of 50 days a year - and otherwise plays host to Army guns and training exercises

Open days: Members of the public are allowed access to Imber between December 20 and January 6, when Christmas services at St Giles church are held

Some 250 people turned up to the sell-out carol service on Saturday.

The Bishop of Salisbury also attended the service in the village, which was chosen as a training ground for its remote location.

One week before Christmas 1943, villagers were evacuated and their Wiltshire was requisitioned by the War Office.

They were given just under two months to clear out - but were told that they would be allowed to return, amid praise from the Government for the sacrifice they were making.

But the war finished and all of the land and property in the village remained in War Office hands.

In the 1950s, the War Office - which was to become the Ministry of Defence - took on responsibility for the upkeep and repair of the church itself.

Haven: The village is in an explosive 'high impact' area, but that didn't dampen the festive cheer in the church, which included music from the Bratton Silver Band

Merry Christmas: Despite the stark, military location, churchgoers and carol singers at the sold-out service were all smiles outside the 13th-century building

It held that responsibility until 2002, when it was turned over to the Diocese of Salisbury.

But
 the Army remains in control of the site and restricts access to it, 
meaning it is only open for up to 50 days every year for church services
 - many around the Christmas period.

The entire village is a designated high explosive 'impact area' in the Salisbury Plain military training zone, and the village sits in the middle of it.

It is surrounded by a 10ft chain fence, locked gate and 'out of bounds' and 'danger' notices.

Pubs and a manor house in the village stand empty and derelict, many of them reduced to concrete shells.

Ghost town: Purpose-build MoD houses for training exercises stand alongside the shells of former Imber buildings, and form what has been a ghost town for 70 years

Guns: Old tanks are dotted across the Salisbury Plain and are used as part of the 'scenery' for military exercises around Imber

Drive by: During the rare opening periods, visitors are allowed a glimpse of both a wartime town and given an insight into MoD training in this haunting location, which was originally requisitioned for D-Day landings training

Purpose-built MoD buildings have since been added to the village for training.

The
 Grade II* listed church with its 15th-century murals is the only 
building to have escaped the fate of Imber's other buildings.

Imber opens for several services over Christmas, with roads to Imber open between 4pm on December 20 and 8am on January 6 - subject, of course, to 'urgent operational need'.

Tickets were required for the carol service due to overwhelming popularity, although the village is still open to other visitors during this period.

Tradition: Carols were accompanied by the brass band and by hand-bell ringers as people sang in the centuries-old, unheated church

Cut off: Normal military operations will resume on January 6 and Imber will be closed again - and in the meantime, drivers and churchgoers are warned to stay on the paths for fear of discarded explosives

Historic: The 13th-century church is adorned on the inside with beautiful 15th-century murals and is the only building in the village to be undamaged by guns and time

Sneak peek: The manor house is gated off and abandoned, but can be seen by peering through the bolted metal barriers and gates that surround Imber and many of its buildings

The guns in Imber also fall silent on the feast of St Giles in September every year.

The
 December 21 service included performances by the Bratton Silver Band 
and the Salisbury St Thomas Hand-bell Ringers - and churchgoers were all
 given a glass of mulled wine and a mince pie.

St Giles Church is cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust, a national charity protecting historic churches at risk. For more information, visit: www.visitchurches.org.uk.
