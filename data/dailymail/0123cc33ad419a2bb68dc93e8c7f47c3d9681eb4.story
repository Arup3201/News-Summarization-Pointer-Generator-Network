As President Barack Obama hit out at Republicans who have criticized his economic policies, he singled out Republican Senator Rand Paul - who previously said income inequality has worsened under Obama's administration.

During the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting today, Obama remarked on Paul's 2013 comment that the Republican party needs to show up on the South Side of Chicago and shout: 'We are the party of jobs and opportunity'.

The president said, while smiling, it is 'encouraging' that the 2016 presidential hopeful wants to go to his hometown and that Paul would be welcomed there, adding 'we are a friendly bunch'.

As President Barack Obama (above during the Democratic National Committee winter meeting) hit out at Republicans who have criticized his economic policies, he singled out Senator Rand Paul - who previously said income inequality has worsened under Obama's administration

During the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting, Obama remarked on the Kentucky senator's (Rand Paul, right) comment that the Republican party needs to go to the South Side of Chicago, and shout: 'We are the party of jobs and opportunity'

While giving his speech, Obama said it is 'not an accident' that the economy is improving under his watch, and chided Republican party critics for predictions that haven not come true, according to CNN.

He said: 'Now that their grand predictions of doom and gloom and death panels and Armageddon haven't come true. The sky hasn't fallen, chicken little is quiet.

'The new plan is to re-brand themselves as the party of the middle class. I am not making this up.'

The president also seemed to reference a comment made earlier this week by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who does not think Obama 'loves America'.

In his speech, he said this is not an ideological battle or about putting notches on a belt, but that it is about 'making this nation we love more perfect'.

Obama also said he welcomed the attention Republicans have been giving the middle class, 'but so far at least the rhetoric has not matched the reality.'

He gave a rousing defense of his economic policies and promoted his agenda as the right policy and political prescriptions for Democrats heading into the 2016 elections.

While Obama said he was willing to hear Republican ideas for helping the middle class, he also argued that the best way for Republicans to prove their commitment was by supporting his call for a higher minimum wage

He said the party's belief in 'middle class economics' has spurred economic growth and job creation. 

'I just want everybody to remember that at every step as we made these policies, made this progress, we were told by our good friends the Republicans that our actions would crush jobs, explode deficits and destroy the country,' he said. 

'If we were actually to look at the evidence, it's pretty clear who's theory of how to grow the economy and make sure American people are prospering, which theory works. We know their ideas don't work.'

With the economic recovery showing signs of taking hold, Democrats and Republicans have turned their attention to improving wages for working class Americans. 

Obama also seemed to reference a comment made earlier this week by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (above), who doubted Obama's love of the country. The president said this is not an ideological battle or about putting notches on a belt, but that it is about 'making this nation we love more perfect'

While incomes have increased modestly recently, they hardly make up for decades of paycheck stagnation. 

Both sides, however, have distinctly different views of how to boost wages. 

Democrats want increases in the minimum wage, while Republicans call for fewer regulations and taxes on business to free more capital that could be used for wage growth.

'If you are serious, if you are really troubled with income inequality,' Obama said, 'then you can't put forward proposals that give more tax breaks to folks who are doing the best.'

While Obama said he was willing to hear Republican ideas for helping the middle class, he also argued that the best way for Republicans to prove their commitment was by supporting his call for a higher minimum wage.

'The shift in rhetoric that they're engaging in is good if it actually leads them to take different actions,' he said.
