Many people exercise to music and the majority of these have some form of fitness tracker or app.

Now joggers and cyclists can combine the two - with headphones that play music without the need for a phone and track your steps and sleep.

The TalkBand N1 also doubles up as a stereo Bluetooth headset so if you choose to pair it with a phone, you can receive and make calls too.

They know when you're awake: Huawei's new TalkBand N1 headphones track every movement of their users, including how many calories they have burned, all while having storage space for 1,000 songs

Chinese tech giant Huawei announced the headphones alongside its next-generation fitness tracker - the TalkBand B2 - at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

The N1 looks like a standard pair of headphones but has a Bluetooth chip, accelerometer and 4GB of storage inside - the equivalent to 1,000 songs.

By being Bluetooth-enabled, the headphones sync with the TalkBand app for both Android and iOS devices meaning they can be used to make calls - using a built-in microphone - or stream songs from a phone.

This includes apps such as Spotify.

Huawei told MailOnline the headphones will go on sale by the end of September this year and although official prices haven't been announced, the earbuds are expected to retail for around £100.

The TalkBand app will add support for the headphones through a software update nearer the time of release.

Elsewhere, the headphones are IP54-rated waterproof, will work for three days and can be charged via microUSB.

The N1 will last for 12 days on standby, or for five hours for continuous calls.

Advanced: Britta O'Boyle of Pocket-lint.com told MailOnline activity-tracking headphones are the latest trend

Britta O'Boyle, features editor at Pocket-lint.com told MailOnline: 'Headphones used to just play your favourite track and activity tracking used to come in the form of a pedometer at best, but those days are long gone.

'The two functions are now colliding into one device and Huawei's latest wearable attempt not only does both and looks good doing it, but it also has Bluetooth calling for added convenience.

'The activity-tracking headphone sector is just at its beginning but the addition of Huawei's TalkBand N1 to current options such as LG and Jabra's heart rate monitoring models represents the exciting times that lie ahead.'

Elsewhere, Huawei's TalkBand B2 smartwatch builds on the features of its original tracker by adding a six-axis gyro and accelerometer.

New kit: In addition to tracking calories and steps, the B2 smartwatch is smart enough to recognise what activity is being carried out, from cycling to walking and running, and sleeping

In addition to tracking calories and steps, the B2 is smart enough to recognise what activity is being carried out, from cycling to walking and running, and sleeping.

The 0.3-inch touchscreen features gesture support and the band also syncs with the free TalkBand app for Android and iOS. It can be paired with two phones at the same time.

This is useful for a work and business phone, for example, or if being shared within a family.

The battery on the B2 works for five days, is available for 12 days on standby and seven hours for a call.

It comes with a leather or plastic strap and prices are expected to retail for less than £150, although Huawei didn't confirm this.

Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer BG, said: 'Today's wearable device announcement showcases Huawei's commitment to inspiring creativity.

'Our wearable devices are to be connected and synchronized to offer the best all-around smart solution and personal monitoring based on individual need.

'No doubt, wearable devices will remain one of the most significant trends in the device industry, and by leveraging Huawei's technology and innovation, Huawei Consumer BG aims to be a leader in the wearable space.'
