A bride-to-be had her heart melted by her very own Prince Charming when he made her dreams come true with a Frozen-themed marriage proposal.

Brian Davis, 23, from Denver Colorado asked his girlfriend Michelle Sequin, 22, to marry him disguised as Prince Hans from the hit film, while his bride-to-be dressed up as Princess Anna.

Brian and Michelle went to see Frozen on a date together and so the film has always been particularly close to the couple's hearts.

Brian surprised his bride-to-be Michelle by recreating a scene from the movie Frozen

'We saw Frozen on a date together and both fell in love with the film. It gave me the idea for the proposal' says Brian.

'I wanted to create a perfect Disney scene, where a charming prince would woo his princess by riding up on his trusty steed and proposing in front of a castle.'

Brian, a medical student, met Michelle when they were teenagers and knew from the start that he wanted her to be his wife.

'From the second day after I met her I knew I wanted to marry her' says the groom who decided to propose to Michelle, a biomedical engineer, shortly after she graduated from university.

Fairytale romance: Brain had replicas of Frozen costumes run up for both of them to make the experience feel more authentic

The proposal took careful planning and Brian enlisted the help of Michelle's relatives to keep the plan a surprise

When it came to realising his dream of recreating the fairytale Brian spared no expense to ensure that the experience was 'completely authentic'.

The devoted groom ordered custom-made tailored versions of Anna's coronation dress and Hans' regal outfit at a total cost of Â£180, working with her relatives to create the perfect fit.

'I had to estimate Michelle's size with the help of her mother in order to keep it a secret.

'The outfits arrived in time and they looked fantastic. I was excited and it was hard not to tell her what I was planning.'

Prince Charming: Brian even hired a trusty steed to complete his royal entrance

Michelle was utterly surprised by the proposal as she had been lead to believe she was going out to dinner

Not satisfied with a simple costume change the committed groom then went in search for a castle to create the perfect romantic setting for his proposal.

Unfortunately fairtytale castles are few and far between in Denver and Brian eventually settled on a venue called Castle Marne Inn a near-by mansion with castle-like features.

Brian's proposal was given an extra flourish with his arrival on a 'trusty steed', like the character from the film.

Setting the scene: Short of a castle, Brian opted for a nearby mansion as the location of his proposal

Brian based the custom-made dress  on Anna's coronation outfit from the film

'I called the manager (of the Inn) and asked her if she would allow me to bring a horse onto the property. She loved the idea and was excited to be a part of it. I picked the date and reserved a private dinner for two.'

Once his elaborate plan was in place Brian had to try and figure out how to lure his bride to the venue without raising her suspicions.

'I convinced Michelle we were going to go out for dinner for our fourth anniversary.

'I dropped off Michelle's dress at her house with instructions to wear it. I then saddled up the horse, which was called Romeo, and rode him to the Castle Marne Inn.'

The proposal was completed with a romantic meal for two in the mansion house

Attention to detail: Brian presented the engagement ring in a pink, crown-shaped box, Michelle was utterly shocked by the proposal but immediately said yes

Despite his meticulous planning, Brian still suffered from nerves as he prepared to ask the life-changing question.

'As Michelle arrived I felt my heart beating fast but I never questioned what I was about to do. I was ready to ask her.

'I rode up on Romeo, dismounted and proposed to her beside the castle, under a vine arch.'

Brian presented his bride-to-be with a white gold engagement ring featuring a diamond-studded design.

Michelle was completely taken aback - but said yes immediately, adding that the proposal was a dream come true.

Brian and Michelle announced their engagement to friends with a video of them singing 'Love is an Open Door' Anna and Hans' duet from the film

'I can honestly say that I had no idea the proposal was coming but Brian has always been one to do crazy and romantic things.'

'The entire thing was a dream come true. Once I saw Brian down on his knee all of my nerves went away and became pure joy. I was quick to say yes to my very own Prince Charming.'

The two lovers let their friends know about the engagement in a musical video where they mimed along to the song Love is an Open Door, which features in the film.

The song ends with the lines: 'Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me? Can I say something even crazier? Yes.'

In the movie, the relationship is destined for failure when Princess Anna discovers that Prince Hans is a fraud. But Brian is optimistic that his fairytale proposal will lead to happily ever after.

'It was the best proposal I could have planned for and she is the best princess I could have asked to be mine forever.

'I know our love story's ending will be so much more than happily ever after.'

The pair became engaged in May 2014.
