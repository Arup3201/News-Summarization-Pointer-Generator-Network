A racecourse has banned picnics on health and safety grounds saying picnickers’ chairs were a ‘potential trip hazard’.

Newcastle Racecourse added that the move would leave more room for all.

The venue’s management team said preventing racegoers from spreading out rugs and bringing their own lunch would ease movement and increase visitors’ enjoyment.

Racegoers at Newcastle Racecourse last year. The venue has now decided to ban picnics saying chairs were a 'potential trip hazard' 

But racegoers accused the venue of profiteering by encouraging people to eat at its on-site facilities and of stripping the fun out of events at the course.

The move was even criticised by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), a government watchdog, who said that there was no legislation to stop people from eating picnics at large gatherings.

Bosses said that the ban, which will apply to all meetings at the venue excluding the Blaydon Races, arose from numerous problems at events last year.

The racecourse attracts up to 20,000 on its busiest days, with bosses claiming that up to 5,000 people were blocking lawns around the venue at each event by bringing in chairs and picnic boxes.

Executive director David Williamson denied that the decision was an attempt to force racegoers to eat at food concessions but said it was for the ‘comfort and safety’ of visitors.

He said: ‘This is not a decision that has been made lightly and we hope that this change will allow us to continue to provide an enjoyable experience for all of our guests.’

He said that more seated areas and food outlets would be provided, while a designated picnic area would be set up in the Brandling Estate where the venue is located.

The racecourse is one of 15 tracks owned by Arena Racing Company, the largest racing company in the UK.

‘The amount of people bringing in chairs, rugs, picnic boxes etc caused space to be limited for the number of people attending the race days due to picnickers spreading out,’ he said.

‘The added furniture was a potential trip hazard and a few people reported to first aid because of this.

‘People are under no obligation whatsoever to purchase food while in the racecourse grounds.’

‘We are definitely not taking away people’s enjoyment and want people to have a better time compared to last year.’

But regular visitors said that the move could dampen interest in events at the course, while disabled visitors said the decision not to allow sitting on the grass could affect them.

Sue Nicholson, who attends ladies day at the course with a group of friends every year, said they planned to boycott the venue.

She said: ‘I am shocked. It’s been traditional for everyone to go to a meeting and have a picnic in the Grandstand area on the lawn.

‘It’s fun and it’s friendly. It’s a special occasion when you take your own picnic.’

Miss Nicholson, from Whitley Bay, added: ‘It’s profiteering and I think they will lose business.

‘They have taken the fun out of the event. It’s a short-sighted move and the racecourse will see it is a decision that will turn the public away.’

Craigy White posted on Facebook: ‘This has nothing to do with health and safety. It’s so you will pay top prices for their food at the course.’

Michelle Wright , who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME), said: ‘The decision is absurd. There is disabled parking but you cannot take your own seats in.

‘I cannot stand all day. It’s a shame, I won’t be going again. We’ve gone for a number of years, it’s disappointing.’

In a tongue and cheek message on its official Twitter page, the HSE said the excuse for banning picnics was a ‘non-runner’, adding ‘these silly h&s excuses have gone on furlong enough #bustedmyth’.

A HSE spokesmen said: ‘We see these health and safety stories fairly regularly and they often result in the HSE getting a lot of grief when we have not even been involved, so we have decided to go on the offensive.

‘There is no health and safety legislation to stop people eating picnics at such a venue.’
