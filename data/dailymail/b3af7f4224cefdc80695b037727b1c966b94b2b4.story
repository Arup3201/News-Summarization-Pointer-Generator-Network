The mystery buyer who splashed out £89million for Francis Bacon’s Three Studies of Lucian Freud is claimed to be a 30-year-old Qatari royal dubbed ‘the most powerful woman in art’.

Speculation has been rife about the identity of the anonymous bidder who made history last week by buying the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction.

Although Sheikha Mayassa – the sister of the Emir of Qatar – has not confirmed the purchase, she was said by the New York Post to have bought the Bacon portrait through Manhattan’s respected Acquavella Gallery.

The Qatari royal family is spending more 
than £60billion to prepare for the World Cup and, as head of the Qatar 
Museums Authority, the sheikha is attempting to turn the oil-rich nation
 into a cultural powerhouse.

New York Post claims she was also the reported buyer 
of a Mark Rothko, a Francis Bacon and a Damien Hirst recently auctioned 
at Sotheby’s for more than $160 million. 

Her family spent a record $158 
million for Paul Cezanne’s 'Card Players' last year and a reported $310 
million for 11 Rothkos.

The daughter of Qatar's former emir this year topped the ArtReview Power 100, an annual list which ranks dealers, collectors, curators and artists by importance, because of her art budget. 

Art Review, reported by The Art Newspaper, explained: '[She was] ranked number one in this year’s list on account of her organization’s vast purchasing power and willingness to spend—at a rate estimated to be $1bn a year—in order to get top works of art for its Doha museums.'

The sheika graduated from Duke in 2005 and took
 an internship at Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal’s Tribeca 
Productions, but never revealed her royal identity.

It wasn't until she returned home that she disclosed who she was, and successfully negotiated to bring
 the film festival to Doha.

The Art Newspaper reported last month there could be a change of leadership at QMA - a claim the sheika denies.

The Gulf state, under fire for the working conditions of migrant Nepalese laborers at construction sites in Doha, is reportedly spending $100 billion to prepare for 2022 FIFA World Cup.
