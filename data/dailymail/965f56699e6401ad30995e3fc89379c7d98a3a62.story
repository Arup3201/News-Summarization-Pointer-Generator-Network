When Fusilier Lee Rigby was murdered last year, his son Jack was just two years old.

Today he showed a courage beyond his years, clutching his mother's hand, surrounded by family, all paying their respects at the National National Memorial Arboretum - where his father's name was today etched into the wall of honour.

Jack, who is believed to have turned four today, joined his mother Rebecca at the moving dedication service in Alrewas, Staffordshire, where they laid a wreath in honour of Lee Rigby.

They joined the loved ones of 16 other service personnel who have died on active duty or through acts of terrorism in the last year, all of whom were honoured at the moving service.

Before making the walk with his mother, Jack could be seen clutching on to his Winnie The Pooh toy as he sat with the 180 loved ones who gathered to pay tribute.

Fusilier Rigby's mother Lyn and father Phil McClure were among those who attended to remember Fusilier Rigby.

The names of three SAS soldiers who died on a training exercise on the 
Brecon Beacons in July last year, and two RAF officers who died in an

Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was stabbed to death by two men outside Woolwich Barracks on May 22 last year

Jack was just two years old when Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was stabbed to death by two men outside Woolwich Barracks on May 22 last year. Two men are serving life sentences for his murder.

The brutal killing sparked shock and outrage across the country after he was run over with a car and then hacked to death by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale in Woolwich, south-east London.

The pair, who were known to the security 
services, shouted ‘Allah Akhbar’ – Arabic for ‘God is great’ – as they 
mercilessly slaughtered the defenceless serviceman.

After attending Middleton Technology School in Greater Manchester and later Hopwood Hall College, Fusilier Rigby joined the Army in 2006 and was deployed to Afghanistan three years later.

At the time of his death, he was working in a recruitment post for the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and also assisted with duties at the Tower of London.

His estranged wife Rebecca, the mother of his son Jack, was living near her family home in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

At the time of his death he was engaged to Royal Military Policewoman Aimee West, 22.

The Armed Forces Memorial commemorates more than 16,000 people who have died on duty since the end of the Second World War.

David Cameron has announced £1 million to maintain the Armed Forces Memorial honouring service personnel who have been killed in conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'In the same year as we commemorate the start of the First World War, it is important that we continue to recognise the sacrifices made by our Armed Forces and their families in service to this country.'

The Government is committed to fund the monument through to the end of the next parliament, No 10 said.
