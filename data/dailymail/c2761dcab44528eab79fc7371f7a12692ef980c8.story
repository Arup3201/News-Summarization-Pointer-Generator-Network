By Tuesday evening, Conor McGregor will have travelled more than 13,000 miles in 10 days and visited eight countries on three continents.

He has 14 weeks to prepare his challenge for the UFC featherweight title and will train for hundreds of hours before his date with destiny in Las Vegas on July 11.

But he insists he will need just four minutes to dethrone champion Jose Aldo.

McGregor and Aldo faced the media in London on Tuesday on the penultimate leg of their world tour which has taken in Rio, New York and Los Angeles among others.

And the Dubliner said: 'I find the route to victory here. That's the key to victory here, when I hit people they do not survive. I map out my shot selection and put people away every time.

'Jose has got the basics down well. He's got the right hand, he's got the low kick; he can catch people but after that it's wild, it's sloppy and they escape.

'Look back at his career, you can see the shots remain the same. Then look at my career; my evolution is undeniable and I will continue to get better.

McGregor did most of the talking during the press conference, insisting he was 'prepared to kill'

Defending champion Jose Aldo has not been defeated in 10 years while defending his title eight times

'He does not want it the way I want it. He doesn't want me around, he always wants separation but there will be no separation on July 11.

'I will show up prepared to kill. It will be decided in the first four minutes; he will be out on his feet. The shots I want to land will land and it will be a formality after that. How long he can take that is up to his chin.

'He has been through war after war after war, 25 minutes of getting hit. The brain does not recover, it does not get younger. I will hit him and I will hit him hard. It will be wrapped up within the first four minutes.'

McGregor also revealed he plans to dominate not just his current weight class but, in time, the lightweight division too.

'I definitely have my eyes on the lightweight division,' he added. 'I came into this company as a two-weight champion. I am the only Irishman, the only European to hold belts consecutively.

'Most certainly I'm looking to replicate that achievement on the biggest stage, the UFC. But there are plenty of featherweights who have spoken out of turn and who should have kept their name out of their mouth.

'When you speak my name in vain, no matter how many years down the line, I'm like an elephant, I never forget and I'll come and get you.'

Aldo, who is unbeaten in 10 years and has made eight defences of his title, cut a quieter figure alongside his charismatic challenger.

'I don't fight for anyone else,' he said. 'I feel comfortable with this, I don't have any emotions. He can talk if he wants, he can do anything, the most important thing is to be the champion.

'I'm going to be well prepared and ready to end the fight as quickly as possible.'
