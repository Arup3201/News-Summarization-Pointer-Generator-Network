Tasteless pranksters have 'desecrated' the grave of Titanic lookout Fred Fleet - by placing a pair of binoculars underneath his headstone.

Sick jokers left the binoculars by the resting place of the man who saw the fateful iceberg, along with a note saying: 'Sorry for bringing these 100 years too late.'

Fleet issued the famous words 'Iceberg, right ahead' when he spotted the danger from the ill-fated liner's crow's nest on the night of April 14, 1912.

Stunt: The binoculars were placed under Titanic lookout Fred Fleet's headstone in Southampton, Hampshire

But it was later discovered the 25-year-old was not using vital binoculars because they'd been locked away in a cupboard below decks.

To make matters worse the keys to the cupboard had been taken on another ship by mistake so it could not be unlocked.

At an inquiry into the tragedy Fleet claimed he would have seen the iceberg sooner if he had been issued with a pair.

Pranksters who put the binoculars by the grave also left a note and removed wreaths from near the headstone

Fleet survived the sinking, which claimed 1,522 lives, but committed suicide in January 1965 - two weeks after the death of his wife.

His grave, with a picture of the Titanic engraved on its headstone, lies in Hollybrook Cemetery, Southampton, Hants.

Lookout: Fred Fleet uttered the famous words, 'Iceberg, dead ahead', on the night the Titanic sank

And in the past week it had been laid with wreaths as part of a special ceremony led by the British Titanic Society to mark centenary of the disaster.

But now these have been taken and replaced with a pair of binoculars.

An attached note reads: 'Dear Fred, sorry for bringing these 100 years too late but better late than never!'

The insulting note continues: 'You said if you had these, you would have had time enough to get Titanic away from the iceberg, so here they are! Luv (sic) Francis.'

Inquiries into the disaster in Britain and America never blamed Mr Fleet for the tragedy.

Maritime historians have also since suggested he did everything he could have at the time and had been a very conscientious lookout.

But, despite this, he was taunted in the street about his role in the tragedy and he suffered from an incredible guilt his whole life.

Nigel Wright, from the Titanic Society, has blasted the removal of the wreaths from Mr Fleet's grave.

He added: 'It is a shocking thing to have happened. This is a desecration. I cannot believe someone would remove a wreath - it is just astounding.

'The binoculars are strange enough but to remove everything is disrespectful to the person who was so pivotal.'

He added: 'You cannot blame Fred Fleet for the disaster. It would have been very difficult to use binoculars on the night.'

Titanic experts say it would've been unfair to blame Fred Fleet for the ship's sinking, as using binoculars in the middle of the night would have been very difficult anyway

Fleet had worked for more than four years on White Star Line's ship Oceanic before transferring to the Titanic.

He earned five pounds a month plus an extra five shillings for the important role as lookout.

When Titanic began to sink on the fateful night in 1912, Fleet was one of the crew members assigned to man the lifeboats.

He went on to work on Titanic's sister ship Olympic as a lookout and able seaman.

He was found hanged in his garden in January 1965. Family said he had become depressed after the death of his wife just two weeks before.

He had an unmarked pauper's grave until 1993 when the Titanic Historial Society paid for a headstone.
