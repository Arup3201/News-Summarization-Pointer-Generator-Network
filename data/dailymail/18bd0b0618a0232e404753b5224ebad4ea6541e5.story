In a statement issued through his management company, Lampard said: 'I have taken the decision to retire from international football.

'It has been a very tough decision for me to make which is why I have given it so much thought since the World Cup.

'I have always been exceptionally proud and honoured to represent my country and have to say looking back I have enjoyed every minute of wearing the England shirt.

'Due to my club career now going in a different direction it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first.

'Also, to concentrate on how I can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football.'

The statement continues: 'It is now the time to move forward and I feel very confident that with Roy Hodgson in charge, the young players that we have coming through, and the changes that are being made throughout the development of the youth system in this country, that we will have success in the future and a team that this country deserves.

'I would like to thank all the managers that I have worked under, all the players that I have been fortunate enough to play alongside, and all the England fans for their support, not only at home but particularly on their travels with the team around the world.

'I now look forward to continuing to support the team as a fan and wish them every success for the upcoming campaign towards France 2016.'

Lampard, then a West Ham player, was handed his first England cap by Kevin Keegan during the 2-1 friendly win over Belgium at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland on October 10, 1999.

He scored his first goal for the Three Lions in the 3-1 friendly win over Croatia at Ipswich's Portman Road ground on August 20, 2003. 

Having been overlooked for Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup, Lampard was called up by Sven Goran Eriksson for the 2004 European Championship finals in Portugal.

Lampard was outstanding, scoring against France and Croatia in the group phase and in extra time against Portugal in the quarter-final before England bowed out on penalties.

Following the retirement of Paul Scholes from international football, Lampard became a regular under Eriksson and was twice named England Player of the Year by the fans in 2004 and 2005.

He was England's top scorer in qualification for the 2006 World Cup with five goals, including crucial goals against group rivals Austria and Poland.

Lampard played every minute of England's run to the eight in the finals, staged in Germany, but, along with Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, missed his spot-kick in the shoot-out defeat by Portugal.

His relationship with England's fans hit rock bottom during the ill-fated qualification tournament for Euro 2008 but, under Fabio Capello, he remained a mainstay of the side and scored twice in the 5-1 win over Croatia that secured a place at the 2010 World Cup.

In South Africa, Lampard infamously saw his long-range shot against Germany bounce down off the crossbar and clearly cross the line. But it wasn't awarded and England went on to lose 4-1.

Lampard scored twice in the qualification campaign for Euro 2012 but missed the tournament with a thigh injury.

On March 22, 2013, he surpassed David Platt as England's highest scoring midfielder with a goal against San Marino and was England's vice-captain in Brazil for the 2014 World Cup finals.

His farewell appearance, as it has transpired, was as captain in the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica on June 24.
