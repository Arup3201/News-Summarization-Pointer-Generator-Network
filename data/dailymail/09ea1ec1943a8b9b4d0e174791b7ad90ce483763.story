She may have started life as just another girl from Chelsea, but Millie Mackintosh used her time on the reality TV show to build her brand by launching a successful fashion and beauty range. 

And now she's been given the ultimate seal of approval.

Millie, 25, is honoured to learn that A-listers Amal Clooney and Sienna Miller wore her false lashes on the red carpet at Sunday's Golden Globes.

Charlotte Tilbury, the make-up artist who created both stars' looks, packed Millie's Nouveau Lashes in her kit ahead of awards season. 

Speaking to FEMAIL about the news, the former Made In Chelsea star said: 'Someone pinch me! My make-up artist idol is using my lashes on Hollywood movie stars.'

While Millie knew that Charlotte had packed her lashes, who she would be using them on was under wraps.

'I had no idea but she does make up some incredible actresses for the awards season each year, you can tell who's she's done because she's so good! 

'You can definitely spot a Charlotte Tilbury smokey eye or perfect plumped pout on the red carpet, I love seeing the photos,' said Millie.

Charlotte also worked with Sienna Miller, pictured, who wore Millie's £8.99 lashes at the glittering event

Millie, who also has her own fashion range, launched her lashes a few years ago because she wanted to channel her skills as a make-up artist into something. 

The burgeoning businesswoman has big plans to develop brand Millie this year. She said: 'I did some limited edition corner lashes and they did really well so I would like to bring them out again for summer.

'I am also working on a book with lots of beauty tips as well and food, fashion and fitness, too.'

The successful star also revealed that she'd love to venture into cosmetics in the future. 

'I would love to do a small, everyday essentials line for teenage skin, really natural and all about healthy glowing skin and enhancing what you've got, not covering it,' she said. 

For now, Millie, who is married to Professor Green, is getting set to launch her spring/summer clothing line, which is out in March and 'really boho and festival inspired'.
