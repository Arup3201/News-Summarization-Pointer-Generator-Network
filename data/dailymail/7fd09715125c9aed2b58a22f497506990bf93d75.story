Callous: Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist Philip Hindes has had his bike stolen after burglars ransacked his home

A Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist has had his bike stolen after burglars ransacked his home.

Philip Hindes, who topped the winner's podium at London 2012 in the Team Sprint alongside Jason Kenny and Sir Chris Hoy, used the expensive bicycle for training.

It was taken, along with his car, in a raid on his home in West Didsbury, Manchester, sometime between last Thursday and Sunday.

Thieves smashed through patio doors and ransacked the house, which was unoccupied, during the burglary.

The thieves stole the bike along with the keys to a blue Volkswagen Golf which they drove off in.

Fortunately, his gold medal was not taken.

The bike is described as being a Pinarello Paris which is red, white and blue and has a Sky sticker and Hindes' name on.

It is used in training and was not the bike which Hindes, 19, rode when he won his Olympic medal.

The car was later found burnt out by police.

Detectives have appealed for information on the break-in, which took place between 7.30pm on August 23 and 11pm on August 26.

Detective
Constable Rob Southern, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The reason
we have publicised this theft is so that we can catch the people 
responsible and return the bike to its rightful owner.

'I
would therefore ask anyone who is offered a bike matching this 
description and the image we have released to call police immediately.

'It might be the thieves try and 
offload the bike onto a sports memorabilia collector so I would urge 
anyone who is offered the chance to buy such a bike to call police 
immediately as you could be vital to helping get this bike back.

'I would also ask anyone who has information about the burglary itself, or who might have been involved, to come forward.

Hindes was born in Krefeld, Germany, in 1992.  He took up cycling at the age of 15 and represented Germany at the Junior World and European Championships.

He joined the British Cycling Academy at the age of 18, possible because he has dual nationality because of his British father.

Burglary: The bike was taken, along with his car, in a raid on his home in West Didsbury, Manchester. This is a replica of the stolen bike

He took gold in the men's team sprint alongside Sir Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny in his first Olympic Games.

As well as winning gold, the trio also set a new world record.

The spectacular win was mired in 
controversy after Hindes claimed he had 
deliberately fallen from his bike in an earlier round.

The British team was allowed to restart the qualifier after Hindes crashed seconds into the race.

The trio went on to post a world record time and later won the final against France.

Hindes suggested the crash was part of a deliberate ploy because the British team had made a poor start.

He
said after winning gold: 'We were saying if we have a bad start, we 
need to crash to get a restart. I just crashed, I did it on purpose to 
get a restart, just to have the fastest ride. I did it. So it was all 
planned, really.'

Nasty: Hindes is pictured sitting on the ground after falling during the team sprint qualifying heats. Officials had to assist Hindes as his left foot remained clipped in after the fall

British Cycling categorically denied the fall was any part of a 
plan and said Hindes's comments were 'lost in translation' from a man 
who began learning English only after moving to Manchester from his 
native Germany two years ago.

The International Cycling Union 
confirmed that the incident had been reviewed at the time and the result
was not in question – so all three British cyclists got to keep their 
gold medals.

Losing
finalists France said the action was not against the rules so they did not dispute the result. But they said it left a 'bitter' taste and they
called for a change in the way such incidents are handled.

Hindes
subsequently denied it was deliberate when asked about his earlier 
comments. 'No,' he said, 'I just went out the gate and just lost 
control, just fell down.

'My back wheel slipped and totally lost control and then I couldn’t handle the bike any more and just crashed.'

Anyone with information on the burglary is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
