Referees' chief Mike Riley has called for video technology to be trialled after the latest case of mistaken identity saw the wrong West Brom player sent off at Manchester City.

Gareth McAuley was dismissed after just 89 seconds of the Baggies' defeat for a foul on Wilfried Bony that was actually committed by team-mate Craig Dawson.

Referee Neil Swarbrick later apologised for the error while a furious West Brom manager Tony Pulis demanded the introduction of two manager challenges per game.

BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him 

Swarbrick's blunder is the third case of mistaken identity in a calendar year following Roger East's dismissal of Sunderland's Wes Brown for bringing down Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao last month and a red card for Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs, who was sent off by Andre Marriner when it was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who had handled a shot from Chelsea's Eden Hazard last March.

Riley, general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), acknowledged that now was the time to test replays.

'I think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology,' he said.

'We've been open-minded to things like the goal-decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the Premier League.

'We need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate.'

Riley, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, added that he had spoken to Swarbrick since his gaffe but would not confirm whether he would be selected for the next round of Premier League matches.

City went on to win the match 3-0 as they try to keep their Premier League title hopes alive until the final day 

Following McAuley's dismissal City ensured a miserable week, which included defeats to Burnley and a Champions League exit in Barcelona, ended on a high at a sunny Etihad Stadium.

In a one-sided encounter that often resembled a training ground match of attack versus defence Wilfried Bony's first goal for the home side, a neat finish from close range, set them on their way on 27 minutes.

A horrendous defensive mix-up allowed Fernando to tap in City's 1,000th Premier League goal before the break and David Silva deflected substitute Stevan Jovetic's low drive home to complete a dark afternoon for the Black Country visitors.

The win, which featured 43 shots, eased some of the pressure on City boss Manuel Pellegrini amid reports he will be sacked in the summer if his side end the season trophyless.

Ex-Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard, who started the match in place of the injured Yaya Toure, defended the Chilean.

'He has been a pleasure to work with and he's a very good man,' he said.

'He's a very experienced manager, a very good manager, and I don't think there is any finger-pointing at any individual for the recent form.'

Lampard, who will join sister club New York City FC at the end of the season, admitted tough questions may well be asked in the summer.

'Judgements will be made at the end of the season and that is fair enough,' he added.

Pellegrini himself dismissed claims that Chelsea would not surrender their six point lead at the summit.

After joking: 'Please, no questions about the sack,' he said 'I don't think they are a winning machine all the time.

'I am sure form now until the end of the season every team will drop points.

'You never know what will happen when you have to play for another 24 points.'
