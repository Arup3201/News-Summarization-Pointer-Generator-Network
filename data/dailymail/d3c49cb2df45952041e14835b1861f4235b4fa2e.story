He took over the coveted wingman role from his dad, and it looks like Hamish and Zoe Foster-Blake are playing more dress ups with their baby boy on social media.

Radio personality Hamish and his author wife Zoe welcomed their first child, Sonny Donald Blake in May, posting the extremely photogenic tiny tot wearing boxing mitts to a marsupial makeover, as well as reenacting Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.

The pair have been documenting the little nippers every move from his first smile to his little daytimeÂ  naps.

BuzzFeed crowns Hamish and Zoe as one of Australia's best-looking couple and their little man as world's most adorable baby.

Oh mum, not again! Zoe Foster-Blake Instagrammed a shot of her four month old baby boy Sonny in a cute koala onesie

Too cute! Sonny looked up at his adoring audience in his adorable outfit

Comedian Hamish posted a shot of his little man in a koala onesie, captioning: 'Every year, thousands of babies never get the chance to be dressed up as a koala. You can help stop this. Donate now at makechildrenbekoalas.org.'

The chubby cheeked cherub transformed into a koala cub as he dons a buttoned up bear suit and looks straight into the camera as he dad captures the moment.

The second koala photograph, taken by his mummy sees him lying on a mustard coloured cushion looking distinctly unsure about his new attire as he peers off to the side, his little lips puckered in thought.

Mulling over the addition of his extra head and pair of fluffy ears, the helpless bambino is probably wondering what his parents will dress him in next.

The 33-year-old funny woman, author and beauty editor captioned the other koala shot: 'High on gum leaves. As usual.'

She also posted the latest selfie with her little man on Monday, captioning 'Morning goss sesh. #OMG #canyoubelieveshedidthat #Iknowright.'

Snug as a bug, Sonny poses in a white pin stripe button up onesie, next to his mummy as he appears to have only woken up with his half opened eyes.

Funny man Hamish posts: 'Once again Sonny and @thehughjackman go head to head for a film role, but there can be only one Baby Wolverine'

Just days after the young bub was born, Hamish took to Instagram with a split frame of Hugh Jackman and Sonny both holding two folks up. The 32-year-old dad captioned: 'Once again Sonny and @thehughjackman go head to head for a film role, but there can be only one Baby Wolverine.'

The married couple seem to be enjoying parenthood so far and having plenty of fun with him since birth and has become the apple of his parent's Instagram, staring in a range of adorable shots.

Pictured wearing a grey sloppy jumper and what appeared to be a cartoon printed lion, baby Sonny is seen yawning next to his family cat Meowbert, with his mum captioning: 'Sonny's pretty pumped about his first photo with Meowbert.'

The kooky columnist and founder of Go-To skin care also took to Instagram to post her gorgeous bub in a red pin strupe bear onesie smiling. She jokingly captions: 'Sonny got some shots done for his LinkedIn profile over the weekend.'

Yeow! The sleepy little fellow has become the apple of his mum's Instagram, staring in a range of cute shots

New recruit: Hamish has played the part of Ultimate Wingman to radio and TV pal Andy Lee for years, and now he's handed over the coveted role to his baby boy Sonny

Before the adorable animal dress ups, Sonny was snapped in an white onesie emblazoned with the Ultimate Wingman logo just two months after the birth of his son.

He captions: 'I mean, a tiny pair of aviators would have really made it sing, but I appreciate that he's gone to the trouble of finding a screen printing place and driving there all by himself. Thanks boy.'

Hamish has played the role of wingman to his radio and TV pal Andy Lee for years, and he handed over the coveted role to his little man.

Andy has appeared to be single since his split with model Megan Gale in 2010, but his luck with the ladies might change with the help of the new recruit.

Meanwhile Hamish was recently hospitalised after filming his final season for Hamish & Andy's Gap Year South America, in which he gets up to mischievous capers with his side kick Andy Lee.

Hamish participated in a coming-of-age ceremony with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon jungle where he was required to put his hands into a pair of gloves filled with bullet ants.

The comedian was in fits of pain while filming the last challenge and was treated with intravenous pain relief, antithistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs before he was released eight hours later.

The pair are described as Australia's best looking couple
