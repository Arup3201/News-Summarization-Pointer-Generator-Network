The coach of Russian Premier League club FC Rostov said he will not sign black players and joked that Ebola had spread to the club.

Igor Gamula told local media the club had 'enough dark-skinned players, we've got six of the things' when asked in a post-match news conference on Friday whether Rostov would sign Cameroon defender Benoit Angbwa.

Gamula also said that five of his Russian players were ill with a high temperature and joked that the Ebola epidemic was the cause.

Rostov coach Igor Gamula joked in a press conference that his players were suffering from Ebola

Rostov had been linked with Cameroon defender Benoit Angbwa, seen here playing for Anzhi against Spurs in the Europa League last season, but their manager Igor Gamula said the club had enough black players

'I'm already worrying it's Ebola,' he said, before adding that the reference to the disease was 'a joke, obviously.'

Rostov midfielder Moussa Doumbia is from Mali, which has seen sporadic Ebola cases. He played for Gamula's team in Friday's 1-0 win over Ural Yekaterinburg.

Gamula, 54, took over in September at Rostov, who won the Russian Cup last season and played in this season's Europa League.

Angbwa (right), previously of Krylia Sovetov,  had been linked with a move to struggling Rostov 

Known for making inflammatory comments, Gamula was recently cleared by the Russian Football Union of a disciplinary charge relating to a TV interview in which he shouted at a journalist and criticised a referee.

Rostov are struggling in 14th place in the 16-team Russian league and Friday's win was their first in four games.
