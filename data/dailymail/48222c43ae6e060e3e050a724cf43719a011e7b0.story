Jackie Nicholas, 35, found out she had breast cancer after uploading her no-make-up selfie to Facebook and following a link to a site which advised on how to check breasts for lumps

Mrs Nicholas,  a lecturer at Derby College, had her breast removed and underwent chemotherapy but is not in remission, with no sign of the cancer returning

To her horror she examined herself and found a lump, which was later confirmed as cancer.

Now Mrs Nicholas, a lecturer at Derby College, has undergone treatment for the disease and is  in remission, with no current signs of the cancer returning.

She credits her Facebook friend, Nicola Aldred, for her recovery after being nominated to take part in the campaign.

Mrs Nicholas said: 'It is the power of social media which has saved my life. I've done well to catch this and find it early.

'I've given Nicola a huge thank-you for what she has done - it's amazing.

'I couldn't believe it when I found a lump. I really didn't know what to do.

'I never really thought it would happen to me at my age. It was a totally surreal situation.'

The no-make-up selfie craze was started by teenage mother Fiona Cunningham, of Stoke-on-Trent, who was inspired after seeing actress Kim Novak attend the Oscars without any make-up.

It turned into an internet sensation, with soaring numbers of women posting pictures of themselves wearing no make-up on Facebook and nominating their friends to do the same.

Cancer Research UK said the money  generated has been used to fund 10 new clinical trials.

Mrs Nicholas, who never thought she would be a victim of cancer, said she vividly remembers the moment she discovered the lump.

'I'd read the online story and had looked at the signs and symptoms and it told you how to check,' she said.

'When I found it I thought I was imagining it. It is much more common in people who are 45 and above.'

The no-make-up selfie turned into a viral craze, which has seen soaring numbers of women posting pictures of themselves wearing no makeup on Facebook and nominating their friends to do the same

Too frightened to do anything about it, Mrs Nicholas went ahead with a planned holiday to Paris with husband Tom, a teacher.

She told him about the lump on holiday and they went to a clinic as soon as they could on their return.

She said: 'I went to the doctor who referred me to the breast unit. You should have seen the number of women in there who were waiting.

'The tests showed there was no doubt I had a tumour. I was told by a consultant that I had cancer.

Mrs Nicholas wants to raise awareness that the disease can hit younger women

'Nothing can ever prepare you for hearing those words.

'Straight away I wanted to know what were the chances of me dying? My life was completely out of control.'

After the diagnosis in May, she had to have a breast removed and is facing months of chemotherapy.

She said: 'There is a chance it could return in the future and I will have to be tested for the next five years to make sure.'

She now wants to raise awareness that the disease can hit younger women.

She also would like to thank the hospital that was so helpful during her ordeal.

'I have so much faith in the NHS and we are so lucky to have it,' she said.

'The staff and everybody at Royal Derby Hospital were absolutely fantastic.'

Mr Nicholas, 31, is grateful that a viral craze helped save his wife's life.

He said: 'It's all come about through social media and it is something we can be thankful for.'

Dr Nick Peel, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Thanks to the generosity of our supporters, the #nomakeupselfie trend raised £8 million in just one week, which resulted in us being able to fund 10 clinical trials.

'When it comes to spotting breast cancer early, it's important to get to know what's normal for you, so you're more likely to notice any unusual or persistent changes.'

Mrs Nicholas added: 'If it was not for the no-make-up selfie then I might not be here now. It has definitely saved my life. I did think, am I going to die?

'Whoever came up with the idea of the no-make-up selfie is an absolute genius and a life-saver.'
