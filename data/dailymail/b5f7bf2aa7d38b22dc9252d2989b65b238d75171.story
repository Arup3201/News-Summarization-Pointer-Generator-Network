Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has accused Hamas of causing thousands of unnecessary deaths by fighting in Gaza for longer than was needed.

President Abbas said all casualties could have been avoided and blamed Hamas for needlessly extending the war with Israel.

His words came as hundreds of Palestinian Islamic militants took part in a rally celebrating the 'victory' over Israel, in Gaza City today.

weapons as fighters of Al-Quds brigades, the military wing of the 
Palestinian Islamist organisation Palestinian Islamic Jihad, marched in 
the streets.

Israel and Hamas militants fought for 50 days before reaching a truce on Tuesday, with both sides declaring a victory.

Abbas told Palestine TV in remarks broadcast Friday that 'it was possible for us to avoid all of that, 2,000 martyrs, 10,000 injured, 50,000 houses (damaged or destroyed).'

More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, including hundreds of civilians. Seventy one people on the Israeli side, including six civilians, were killed.

Several Egyptian mediated cease-fire attempts failed. Hamas eventually accepted almost the same truce offered at the beginning.

Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority 
runs the West Bank, formed a unity government backed by Hamas earlier 
this year. Abbas questioned the future of that arrangement in the 
interview.

Egypt, which brokered the peace deal, has said that indirect talks between the two sides would resume within a month.

On
 Thursday, French President Francois Hollande told international 
diplomats that Europe could help oversee the destruction of tunnels used
 by Hamas militants and monitor the territory's border crossings with 
Israel and Egypt.

‘It is 
necessary to move toward an end to the blockade and a demilitarization 
of the territory,’ he said, indicating that international supervision 
could help pave the way for a return of Hamas' rival, the Palestinian 
Authority, to Gaza.

The French proposal, Hollande said, would ‘finally give the Palestinian Authority the means to respond to the humanitarian crisis and to begin reconstruction.’

Whether the sides are ready to accept external involvement is unclear.

Paul Hirschson, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, said that the country is ready to consider any proposal but must be convinced that monitoring will work.

In Gaza, Hamad al-Rakeb, a Hamas spokesman, described Hollande's proposal as ‘mixing poison in the honey.’

Riyad Mansour, Abbas' ambassador to the United Nations, on Thursday welcomed the idea of international monitors as a ‘useful deterrent’ to more fighting.

He acknowledged, however, that disarming Hamas is ‘not realistic.’
