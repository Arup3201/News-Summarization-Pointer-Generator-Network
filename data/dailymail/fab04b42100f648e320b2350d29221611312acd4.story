A former bodyguard of the Sultan of Brunei's ex-wife was today cleared of stealing £12m in diamonds from her employer and replacing them with worthless replicas.

Fatimah Lim, 35, a Commonwealth Games badminton silver medallist, took the gems while working as Mariam Aziz’s bodyguard and jetted off to Geneva to sell them to a diamond merchant for over $7m.

She sold a 12.71 carat blue diamond, worth £7.6million, and 27.1 carat yellow diamond, worth £600,000 and replaced them with duplicates made out of glass and mineral tanzanite.

Mariam Aziz with her former husband, the Sultan of Brunei. Ms Aziz's 
bodyguard Lim was accused of stealing gems valued at £12m, replacing them
 with near-worthless replicas

But Lim insisted that she sold the diamonds on behalf of her employer Ms Aziz who had asked her to do so secretly as she needed the cash to pay off her debts.

Lim
 said her then boss racked up huge debts at some of London’s top casinos
 and wanted replicas made so she could hide her gambling addiction from 
the Bruneian Royal Family.

Ms
 Aziz, 59, once blew £500,000 in one night gambling in the capital and 
would often take her entourage to swanky casinos in London, Singapore, 
and Macau, the court heard.

Lim had also 
been accused of stealing a diamond bracelet belonging to Ms Aziz, worth 
around £3.3m and bought from Graff jewellers in Bond Street.

But a jury at Isleworth Crown Court took nearly 15 hours to find Lim not guilty of three counts of theft.

The Sultan of Brunei's ex-wife Mariam Aziz admitted previously selling jewellery worth £1m to pay off gambling debts

Lim
 had been tempted into a gambling lifestyle by Ms Aziz after she 
persuaded her team of female Muslim bodyguards to play the tables, 
despite their faith.

Jurors heard that the Bruneian royal would each provide them with gambling chips worth up to £3,000 a time.

Lim’s
 gambling credit was eventually increased from £3,000 to £1.5m because 
of her association with Ms Aziz, the court was told.

She
 told jurors she had to sell the diamonds in secret because Ms Aziz did 
not want the Sultan’s family to know of her crazed gambling sprees.

Lim,
 from Singapore, said: ‘I was in the casino car, the chauffeur driven 
car given by casinos to assist Ms Aziz to travel to and from the 
casinos.

‘At that time I was sitting in the back with Ms Aziz, she said she wanted to sell jewellery.

‘I looked at her and she took out two bracelets and she said that she wanted me to sell them for her’.

She continued: ‘At that time she was 
owing to casinos £800,000. She told me that I could find any buyer that 
was sufficient to pay her gambling debts.

‘I
 agreed to it because the jewellery belongs to Ms Aziz and she has the 
right to sell whatever she wanted so I just did whatever I was 
instructed.

‘Ms Aziz said I
 couldn’t say it belonged to her. I asked who I can say these items 
belong to and she says "say it belongs to your mother”.

Lim
 had the real diamonds replicated by a jeweller in London’s famous 
Hatton Garden after providing him with a forged letter stating they were
 a gift from Ms Aziz to her mother, for 28 years of service as her PA.

The
 gems were eventually sold to a buyer in Switzerland for close to £5m - 
around the same sum as Lim claimed her then boss owed to London casinos.

She was confronted for the thefts by Ms Aziz’s nephew Idris Ja’afar in Brunei where she was arrested on January 3, 2010.

Just
 hours after the badminton star had been released on bail by local 
detectives Mr Ja’afar secretly recorded his meeting with Lim - in which 
she made a full confession.

But
 Lim told jurors that she had been forced into a false confession by 
corrupt detectives and made a ‘scapegoat’ by the Bruneian Royal Family.
