Jailed for life: Richard Wiggins broke into his victim's house, wielding a machete in search of drugs and money before cutting his earlobe off

A man wielding a machete who cut off his victim’s earlobe with scissors in a brutal robbery has been jailed for life.

Richard Wiggins, 38, burst into Christopher Holloway’s home armed with a machete in search of drugs and money on March 21 last year.

He handcuffed a terrified Holloway and threatened him with the blade before cutting off his earlobe with a pair of scissors in his house in Folkestone, Kent.

Judge Adele Williams described Wiggins as ‘devoid of conscience’ as the court heard how he and another man broke into Mr Holloway’s home hoping to find a ‘substantial amount of drugs and money’, the prosecutor said.

Wiggins, whose girlfriend is pregnant, carried a machete while his accomplice, who is still at large, carried an axe in the robbery.

Unable to find what they were looking for, the pair stole a wallet and a watch.

Wiggins, who has no fixed address, was found guilty and will serve at least six years in prison in what Judge Williams called a ‘cold, calculated and cruel crime’ that would generate ‘great revulsion by the public’.

The prosecutor told Canterbury Crown Court that Mr Holloway ‘believed he was going to die’ in the assault, which left him with several wounds to his hands and face and left with ‘serious physiological trauma’.

The judge was handed a letter from Wiggins’ pregnant girlfriend, who is expecting his baby in November.

Peter Herrity, defending, said: ‘His relationship with the mother of his child has brought about a salutary effect on him.’

Mr Herrity said Wiggins continued to profess his innocence even after being found guilty.
