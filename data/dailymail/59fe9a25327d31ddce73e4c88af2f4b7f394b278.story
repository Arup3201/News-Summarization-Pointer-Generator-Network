The sites where US scientists secretly developed the atomic bomb before they were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 are set to become national parks.

The national laboratories in Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and Hanford - which were all part of the Manhattan Project - will be opened to the public to the as a result of new legislation being passed by Congress.

Officials from the National Parks Conservation have insisted that the sites in New Mexico, Tennessee and Washington will not 'celebrate' the creation of an atomic weapon.

Instead the landmarks will look at the 'impacts, both positive and negative, that resulted from splitting the atom'.

Legislation being passed by Congress means areas like this one in Hanford (pictured in August 1945) will be protected and open to the public

The U.S Department of Energy that runs the Hanford site was fined $10,000 a week in 2014 for failing to removed radioactive sludge away from the site which remained following the research project 

According to CNN, the bill is awaiting President Obama's signature. If passed the parks are due to be operational by 2021. 

The 1945 attack on Japan, credited by some for ending the Second World War, killed more than 100,000 people instantly in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki.

More than 100,000 died in the aftermath due to the effect of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness. Most of those killed were civilians. 

To this day, the bombings remain history's only acts of nuclear warfare. 

By August 1945, the Allied Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory had devised two types of bombs. 

The 509th Composite Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces was equipped with a Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands, to the south of Japan.

A uranium gun-type atomic bomb, code-named 'Little Boy', was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by a plutonium implosion-type bomb, called 'Fat Man' on the city of Nagasaki on August 9. 

Rob Smith, Northwest Regional Director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said: 'The complex stories of the Manhattan Project are ideal topics for the National Park Service – our country's premier story tellers to interpret.

'As only a small percentage of our national parks currently interpret science and technology, the Manhattan Project National Historical Park will continue to enhance our country's best idea, as we look towards the 2016 centennial celebration of our National Park System.'

The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico is one of the sites earmarked to be opened. Two types of bombs were devised at the site before the attacks

Pictured in 1950, Los Alamos was one of two laboratories in the United States that were designated to work on nuclear weapons. The facility was established in 1942 

David Nimkin, Senior Southwest Regional Director for the National Parks Conservation Association, added:  'The National Parks Conservation Association has worked for several years with Representative Hastings and Congressional leaders from New Mexico, Washington, and Tennessee in efforts to make this park a reality. 

'We believe that this national park will allow visitors to consider the project's many ethical, cultural, and scientific implications. The sites will not celebrate the creation of atomic weapons, but put into context the impacts, both positive and negative, that resulted from splitting the atom.'

Clarence Moriwaki, the President of the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial Association who lost family when the atomic bomb was dropped, says there is 'no glory' in its use, but agreed that it is an important part of American history and should be remembered.

As part of the legislation, six other landmarks will become protected. 

They are: The Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the Coltsville National Historical Park in Connecticut, The Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in New York, the Valles Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico, the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument in Nevada and the National World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. 

Another 15 will be extended.
