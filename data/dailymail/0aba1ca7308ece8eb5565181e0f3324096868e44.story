A $100,000 wardrobe allowance, a monthly $15,000 hotel budget and a $25,000 stylist - explosive legal documents behind Cheryl Cole's X Factor US lawsuit have revealed the star was promised a pampered deal to take part in the show.

The 29-year-old is suing show bosses Blue Orbit Productions for a huge $2.3million as she claims she was promised the cash, even if she didn't take part in the show.

As well as a lavish $1.8m salary for the first season and $2million for the second, the legal documents reveal bosses promised 'the talent' extras worth $142,500 and to pay for the star's security.

You're sued Simon! Cheryl Cole's lawsuit has revealed just how pampered a princess she is

Cole alleges Cowell promised her free
first class travel from London to LA while the production company would
also pay for three of her staff to fly coach into LAX.

Cole
claims that she signed a 'Pay or Play' contract with Blue Orbit 
Productions that assured her $1.8 million for the first season and $2 
million for the second even if she didn't appear on the programme.

Although Cheryl concedes that she was paid the $1.8 million for Season One, she says she's still owed the $2 million for Season Two plus all that money for her various expenses.

Legal documents: The dossier provides an insight into just what Cole was promised by Blue Orbit

The
legal documents, filed on December 7, state: ''Plaintiffs are informed 
and thereon allege that it was Blue Orbit's intention (and its practice 
as to other performers to whom Blue Orbit paid such allowances) to pay 
out these allowances as part of payroll along with other compensation.

'The Agreement also provides that Blue Orbit is to reimburse Cole for the cost of personal security and first class airfare between London and Los Angeles for Cole and coach round-trip airfare between London and LA for three individuals on Cole's staff.'

Big money: Cheryl Cole, pictured with Simon Cowell on X Factor UK, was dumped from the US version of X Factor and now she's suing the show's producers for more than $2.3 million

The alleged breach of contract is explained as on June 5 Blue Orbit 'elected to exercise its pay or play right' and 'refused to pay Cole the $125,00 in wardrobe and stylist allowance that it owed Cole as well as her salary for the second season.

Producers reportedly were convinced the 
American audience wouldn't understand what she was saying beneath her 
heavy Geordie accent.

Nicole Scherzinger became Cheryl's replacement before she, in turn, was let go and replaced by Britney Spears.

MailOnline has contacted Simon Cowell for a comment.
