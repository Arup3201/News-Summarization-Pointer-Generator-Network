And so to Match 64, or the World Cup Final as you and I call it. And the two teams are rested, recuperated, and ready for ‘the big one’.

No, not the superstars of Germany and Argentina, but the BBC and ITV World Cup line-ups chosen and charged up for the occasion.

In times past, any tactic would be used to get an edge, but now there is a reality check.

High flyer: Gary Lineker made an airbourne entrance on the BBC's World Cup coverage

The BBC know they will win the ratings battle: tradition, personal choice, and avoiding the adverts sees to that, while ITV will pick up a tidy commercial sum.

However a very keen professional rivalry still exists. This is TV Sport Business with a capital B. So here goes:

PRESENTERS:

BBC: Gary Lineker starred as an England player in the two tournaments that climaxed in the previous Germany v Argentina World Cup Finals, heavyweight credibility. The BBC host starts airborne with a filmed panoramic flight over Rio but when the programme ‘lands’ in the studio he is seriously suited and fluted. It’s a statement.

Landing: Gary Lineker was seen over Rio in casual wear at the start but looked smart in a suit in the studio

Final countdown: Rio Ferdinand, Alan Shearer, Alan Hansen and Lineker in the studio

ITV: Adrian Chiles seems happy to work on a ‘brilliant’ World Cup in Brazil and has backed it up daily by wearing smiles and shorts. But not tonight. It’s still beachside but he opts for full length trousers. 'Copacabana Beach has been our home since day one and we are going to finish where we started,' he says.

STUDIO/BEACHSIDE PUNDITS:

BBC: Alan Hansen, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, like Lineker, are sharp-suited. Ferdinand, an outstanding new addition to football punditry, underlines he has enjoyed being a member of the BBC team and seeing a World Cup from a different perspective. And with the BBC, he’ll realise, in due course, you always win the Final.

Beach boys: Martin O'Neill, Ian Wright, Adrian Chiles, Lee Dixon and Glenn Hoddle

Interesting: Glenn Hoddle's hair was battered by the wind but his analysis was spot on for ITV

ITV: Lee Dixon, Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Martin O’Neill, like Chiles, sport long trousers and spill out their theories. Hoddle and O’Neill have been ITV’s outstanding experts and that is still the case tonight. Hoddle is sharp on tactics, while O’Neill is entertainingly forthright including memorably getting Che Guevara into the big game's match analysis.

STADIUM PRESENTERS/EXPERTS:

BBC: Clarence Seedorf, a Group stage star for the BBC is in the Maracana Stadium thinks Messi will play a big part in the Final and that while Germany face their toughest match they should win.

Strike a pose: Fabio Cannavaro was able to recall his memories as a World Cup winning captain eight years ago

ITV: On the other side, Fabio Cannavaro has marveled at the magic of Mascherano, but as a World Cup-winning captain, he gets personal: ‘today brings back memories, very good memories’.

THE MATCH:

It’s Guy Mowbray’s second World Cup Final for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson has fought off tough opposition to retain his place, probably on the basis he’ll concentrate more on the quality of the football than the quips.

Both Mowbray and Clive Tyldesley, ITV’s man up front, deal with Germany’s late change, Sami Khedira out, Christoph Kramer in.

Gonzalo Higuain scores for Argentina but it is offside. Both Mowbray and Tyldesley catch it quickly.

ITV’s Glenn Hoddle says at half time that ‘Argentina need to get Leo Messi in the game more’. And it nearly happens two minutes after the break, Messi misses – unbelievably. ‘Of all the players’,

Lawrenson says what we are all thinking.

EXTRA TIME:

The tired players reach a mid-extra time break and Hansen puts it straight on the line. Whatever the tiredness…: ‘This is 15 minutes which could define your life.’

And then it happens – Mario Gotze scores with a ‘sensational finish’, ‘a symbolic goal scored by one of the new batch of great Germans’, Lawrenson and Mowbray respectively.

At the final whistle ITV’s Tyldesley sums up the achievement of the new world-beaters: ‘It’s Germany’s time again. The first European winners in South America. The reality is that Germany are champions of the football world.’

But let us leave the last word with the retiring Alan Hansen:

'It’s a great way to go,’ he says. The World Cup here has been sublime. And the goal that won the World Cup was extra-special.'

Champions: Germany, alongside the BBC, were the big winners on the biggest footballing night
