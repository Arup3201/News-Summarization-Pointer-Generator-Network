The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned David Cameron’s push for gay marriage will diminish the institution and weaken the family.

In his first major intervention on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, the Most Rev Justin Welby said he could not support the legislation ‘as it stands’.

Despite their vocal opposition, bishops are set to abstain from a crunch vote on gay marriage in the House of Lords tonight.

Warning: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the gay weddings laws effectively abolish marriage as an institution

The vote comes as sources said there had been pressure from Downing 
Street on Church House, the headquarters of the Church of England.

Last night, Archbishop Welby argued that same sex marriage ‘at its heart
 is not a faith issue, it is about the general social good’.

He added: ‘Rather than adding a new and valued institution alongside it 
for same gender relationships, which I would personally strongly support
 to strengthen us all, this Bill weakens what exists and replaces it 
with a less good option that is neither equal nor effective.

‘The concept of marriage as a normative place for procreation is lost; 
the idea of marriage as covenant is diminished; the family in its normal
 sense, predating the state, and as our base community of society, as we
 have already heard, is weakened.’

Archbishop Welby expressed regret for the way the Church had treated homosexuals in the past

The Bill would not deliver equality because elements of the legislation 
distinguish between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage, he argued. ‘The 
result is confusion. Marriage is abolished, redefined, and recreated, 
being different and unequal for different categories.’

He added that it was ‘with much regret but entire conviction I cannot 
support the Bill as it stands’. Sources in the Lords said the Archbishop
 was not expected to vote on the Bill.

The Lords debate continues today after the Prime Minister’s attempt to 
legalise gay marriage was pushed through with the backing of Labour MPs 
last month.

All three main parties are giving their peers a free vote, but with more
 Labour, Lib Dem and Tory peers in favour of the Bill, it is expected to
 go through. Cross-benchers are likely to be split.

Lord Dear, a former chief constable, urged peers to reject the 
‘ill-considered’ Bill and introduced a wrecking amendment to scupper it.

‘We find ourselves in a world where an ill-conceived Bill seeks to 
overturn centuries of tradition, heedless of public opinion and 
religious leaders and blind to the laws of unintended consequences,’ he 
said.

However, equalities minister Baroness Stowell of Beeston argued marriage
 needed to be extended to same sex couples to remain sustainable.

She said: ‘We believe same-sex couples should be able to marry if they 
want to and extending that choice is the right thing to do for them and 
the right thing to do for the future of marriage,’ she said.
