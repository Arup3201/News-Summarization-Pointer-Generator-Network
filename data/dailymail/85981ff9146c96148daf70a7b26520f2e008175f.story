They are often seen as a healthy alternative to breakfast or chocolate treats, but it seems cereal bars may be better suited to the confectionery aisle.

Research by Which? found that some cereal bars – including those aimed at children – contain more than 40 per cent sugar.

The consumer group analysed the amount of sugar in 15 leading bars and breakfast biscuits and found many of them were not as healthy as most would think.

Which? survey found Kellogg’s Coco Pops Snack Bar, which contains 42% sugar, was the worst offender

Kellogg’s Strawberry Nutri-Grain bars contain 31% whole grain cereal, but are also made up of 33% sugar

The worst offender was Kellogg’s Coco Pops Snack Bar which contained 42 per cent sugar. Other bars marketed at children, such as the popular Choc Chip Harvest Chewee Milk, were also high in sugar and saturated fat.

And while Kellogg’s Strawberry Nutri-Grain Fruit Breakfast Bars contain 31 per cent whole grain cereal, they were found to be made up of 33 per cent sugar.

Which? is now calling for clear nutrition labelling on the front of all packs to alert consumers to the amount of sugar they contain.

Its executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s worrying that cereal bars, especially those aimed at children or claiming to be healthy, contain so much sugar but most don’t make this clear on the front of the pack.

‘We now want the Government to tackle this issue head on by making sure all manufacturers use traffic light nutrition labelling, encouraging reductions in sugar, fat and salt and ensuring manufacturers promote their products responsibly.’

The study found only one of the products, Mars’s Tracker Bar, had the ‘traffic light’ nutrition labelling making it clear to the buyer that the bars are high in sugar and fat.

The lowest level of the sugar found in the 15 bars was in Quaker Oat So Simple Golden Syrup Morning Bar

The lowest level of the sugar found in the 15 bars was in the Quaker Oat So Simple Golden Syrup Morning Bar which contains just over 15 per cent.

A Which? survey of more than 2,100 adults also revealed that around one in four were happy with the action Government and manufacturers were taking to help people to eat healthily.

They also told the watchdog they wanted government to encourage the food industry to lower sugar, fat and salt content in their products and to not promote unhealthy food to children.

A Kellogg’s spokesman said: ‘There are less than two teaspoons of sugar in a Coco Pops Snack Bar – that’s 9 per cent of your recommended intake.

‘We clearly label all our foods so people can make informed decisions about what they buy.’

Which? released the survey results and made the packaging plea yesterday to mark World Consumer Rights Day. 

The annual event recognises the moment in 1962 when US President John F Kennedy first outlined the definition of Consumer Rights. The focus this year is on healthier diets.
