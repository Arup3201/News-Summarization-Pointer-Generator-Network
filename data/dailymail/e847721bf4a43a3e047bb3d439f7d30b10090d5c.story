What's in a name: A county judge in Florida was left speechless when Edward Cocaine, 34, pictured left in his mugshot and right in a Twitter photo from five years ago, stated his last name during a bond hearing

The Sun-Sentinel reported that when asked to state his full legal name, the defendant dutifully responded: Edward Cocaine.

'What?' the stunned Judge Hurley exclaimed. 'You know, I'd thought I'd seen it all.'

With a grin on his face, Hurley then asked Mr Cocaine how many times he has been asked to step out of the car during police traffic stops.

'Just about every time I get pulled over,' Cocaine replied, laughing.

Cocaine explained that his name was passed on from his great-grandparents of Greek origin. They moved to the U.S. in the 1920s.

'I've stuck with it ever since. Back then they didn't know', he said.

The courtroom video has since gone viral and Cocaine said: 'It's pretty cool. I was famous for a minute', the Orlando Sentinel reported.

His charges were dropped when he produced a prescription for the Xanax.
