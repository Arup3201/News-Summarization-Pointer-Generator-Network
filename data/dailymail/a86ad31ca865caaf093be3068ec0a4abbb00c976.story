Jihadists from the Islamic State have agreed a ceasefire with Syrian rebels in a suburb of the capital Damascus, it has been revealed. 

The deal was agreed between Isis and moderate and Islamist rebels in Hajar al-Aswad, south of the city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 

It comes as it was revealed that Isis had seen revenues from black-market oil sales plummet - after key engineers fled from oil fields captured by the terrorists in Iraq and Syria.

Under the deal, 'the two parties will respect a truce until a final solution is found and they promise not to attack each other because they consider the principal enemy to be the Nussayri regime.'  

Nussayri is a pejorative term for the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs, Agence France-Presse reports.

Syria's armed opposition initially welcomed jihadists including Islamic State members in their fight against Assad.

But the group's interpretation of Islam and quest for domination of captured territory sparked a backlash against it that began in January.

A coalition of rebel groups pushed IS out of much of northern Syria, but it has recaptured much of that territory in recent months and has a strong presence in Hajar al-Aswad. 

Islamic State has seen revenues from black-market oil sells plummet - after a number of key engineers fled from oil fields captured by the terrorists in Iraq and Syria 

Isis has captured oil fields at Sasan, Ajeel and Sadid in Iraq as well as Omar in Syria while large refineries have also been captured at Fallujah, Aksas and Tikrit

Meanwhile, there are claims that the terrorist group has seen revenues from its illegally-held oil fields halved after many workers abandoned the facilities.

Some estimates suggest the terrorist group had been making up to $3million (£1.8million) a day in July from oil fields they have seized during the conflict. 

The Times reports that military setbacks in recent weeks may have prompted a dramatic reduction in revenue from the criminal enterprise.

And there are reports that this could drop further amid plans by the United States and its partners to launch airstrikes on key Isis strongholds in the two countries.

The newspaper quotes Michael Stephens from the Royal United Services Institute think-tank as saying: 'Revenues are down below $1.5million a day now.

'I can see Isis running out of oil down the line. They are not at that point yet - production in Syria is still pretty stable - but I think they're in trouble.'

The terrorist organisation has gone about 'plundering' oil and gas facilities since its emergence in 2012, The Times reports, and has even appointed an 'oil minister' to run the illegal industry after its operatives stole 200 lorries in Iraq.

It has captured oil fields at Sasan, Ajeel and Sadid in Iraq as well as Omar in Syria while large refineries have also been captured at Fallujah, Aksas and Tikrit, the newspaper reports, adding that many staff were persuaded to stay on with pay rises or 'at the barrel of a gun.'

But many of the existing engineers have since fled with Isis running with 'skeleton staff' at some of the facilities including Omar, which has changed hands three times since the conflict started.

It is understood that Isis was taking about 80,000 barrels a day from oil fields it was controlling in the two countries - but that has halved in the last two months.

The newspaper says Isis makes up to $25 a barrel, using smuggling networks to transport their product across borders.  

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived at Cairo International Airport today ahead of a for a short visit of less than a day to discuss how Egypt can help in the fight against Islamic State.

He has been on a regional trip to gather support for Barack Obama's plans to counter the militant group.
