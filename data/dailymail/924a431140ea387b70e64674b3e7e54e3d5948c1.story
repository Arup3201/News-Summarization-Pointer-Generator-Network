Three people have been arrested over the hit-and-run death of a five-year old  - ten years after he was killed as he walked to his grandmother's house.

Samuel Walker was run down in front of his mother in 2003 as they were on their way to a family picnic with relatives.

The youngster - described by his family as a 'little angel' - was rushed to hospital with severe injuries but died later that day.

Police found a silver Mitsubishi Galant dumped half a mile away, but despite a £20,000 pounds reward for the killer’s capture plus public appeals for information by the boy’s family, the culprit remained free. The car was reported stolen shortly after the accident.

Following a tip off Greater Manchester Police said a 33-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after a re-appeal on the tenth anniversary of Sam’s death.

Officers also detained a 31-year-old man on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and perjury and a 56-year-old woman on suspicion of perjury.

The tragedy occurred on February 9, 2003, when Sam, his mother Jackie Thomson, then 34, his sister Aimee Walker, then 12, and cousin Faye Lim, five, were heading off for Sunday lunch in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.

They left the Co-op after picking up sandwiches and drinks and were walking to the home of Sam’s grandmother when the Mitsubishi ploughed into the family as they were part way across the road.

Mrs Thomson said she checked no cars were coming and the four began to cross the road. But before reaching the other side, she saw the vehicle speeding towards her family.

Despite the collision, the car sped off and was found abandoned just 20 minutes later onRiverside Avenue.

No one else was injured in the collision. At the time police arrested two suspects including the owner of the car but both were released without charge.

In 2004 Samuel’s mother issued a public appeal for information urging her local community to turn in the killer.

Mrs Thomson, then 35, said: 'This past year has been a living nightmare without Sam.

'The events of that afternoon will never go away and we are still living with the knowledge that no-one has been brought to justice for what they did to Sam.

'That day was so normal, I’ve lived here for 20 years and crossed that road a million times. We came out of the shop, looked left, looked right and set off.

'I was carrying my shopping in both hands but had the kids right next to me. The car came out of nowhere, it felt like whichever way we moved it went to same way. I felt completely helpless.

'Sam’s death has ripped all our lives apart. He was so bright, chatty and friendly, our little prince, our angel.

'He was one of those kids who loved going to school. He always had a smile on his face and everyone loved him.

'If the people who’ve done this or anyone who knows who’s done this has a heart, please talk to the police, don’t keep it to yourselves. For our sake and for Sam.

'I feel like justice hasn’t been done. No-ones been punished and it has just been so difficult to live with, not knowing who did this.

'It is hard knowing that this person might live on the community and people must know him and they are not coming forward.

'He has done a terrible thing and he needs to be punished for what he has done.'

During the police investigation, witnesses said they saw the car careering through the Merseybank estate.

At
Riverside Avenue the Mitsubishi mounted the pavement and was driven 
down the footpath before the driver abandoned the car and ran off across
the dual carriageway Princess Parkway. 

The driver of the car was described as a black man aged between 18 and 21.

At 4pm, three hours after Sam was knocked down, the Mitsubishi was reported stolen by its owner Craig Chevellau.

Mr
Chevellau claimed the car was stolen around 12.15pm, less than an 
hour before the collision while he made a phone call from a public phone
box.

At an inquest in 
December 2006, in which a coroner recorder a verdict of unlawful killing, 
Mr Chevallau gave evidence and dismissed a claim his statement was a 
'pack of lies'.

No forensic evidence has been recovered to prove that he was the driver - something that he has always denied.

Police said all three suspects remained in police custody for questioning.

Sgt Lee Westhead said: 'I have always maintained that the answers to the circumstances surrounding Samuel’s death lay within the community and I would like to thank the witnesses that have come forward so far.

'It has moved the investigation along and has enabled us to make these arrests today. 

'After our appeal in February, a significant person contacted the police with information about the driver responsible and other events that day.

'I would ask that person to please contact us again. I would be very interested to speak to them, anonymously if necessary, as I believe they hold vital information.

'I continue to appeal to anyone else who saw what happened that day, or anyone who has any information about the incident, to come and speak to us.

'You can make a difference. You can help send out a message that communities will not be silenced about wrongdoing in the areas where they live and raise their children.

'It is clear that the community want to end the suffering of Samuel’s family. They have endured enough. The cowards involved have hidden for too long and it is time to end this.'
