The Dallas Cowboys cheerleader tackled by the team's tight end Jason Witten has mysteriously deleted her Twitter account, prompting speculation she was silenced by the National Football League.

The 6'6" player, who weighs a mighty 265lbs, took down Melissa Kellerman when he ran out of bounds at the Thanksgiving Day game against the Miami Dolphins.

Miss Kellerman, who bounced up unscathed and seemed amused after the incident, initially took to the micro-blogging website to make light of her run-in.

'Not hurtin' today, like some of y'all
thought I would be! Our TE isn't as tough as he looks... That or I'm 
WAY tougher than I look,' she wrote on Friday morning.

CNBC reports the 22-year-old was forced to delete her Twitter account after posting the messages.

The network's Darren Rovell 
subsequently tweeted: 'Cowboys not allowing interviews 
with tackled cheerleader @MelissaRae regarding yesterday's game,' and 
later, 'Shame on the Cowboys for pulling cheerleader @MelissaRae off 
Twitter. Not allowing these girls to capitalise is criminal.'

Witten caught a Tony Romo pass but was
forced out in the fourth quarter of a 20-19 win over the Dolphins, reported the Los Angeles Times.

However, he could not stop as he left 
the field and pulled Miss Kellermanover with his right arm. Some viewers
speculated that he was trying to protect her.
