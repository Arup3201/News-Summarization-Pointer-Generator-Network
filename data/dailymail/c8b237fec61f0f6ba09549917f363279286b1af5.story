They have become a must-have gadget for many a fitness fanatic.

But if you’re the kind of person who won’t leave the house without a sports watch, it may soon be time to ditch it.

Inventors have unveiled a new digital running shirt which has all the features of an electronic tracking device and more.

In the sports arena, the 'D-Shirt', pictured, by French company Cityzen Sciences was demonstrated with a team of basketball players. It is made from a special fabric woven with sensors which record a wearer's heart rate, GPS location, route, speed and altitude

The ‘D-Shirt’ is made from a special fabric woven with sensors which record your heart rate, GPS location, route, speed and altitude.

The shirt is made from a Smart Sensing fabric woven with integral micro-sensors.

They
 send the information to a small detachable transmitter on the back of 
the shirt, which sends transmissions to the smartphone via Bluetooth.

The transmitter on the garment must be detached before washing.

Transmissions
 can only be made up to 10 metres away from the phone, so if it is left 
at home the data will arrive when the runner returns.

If the runner or their personal trainer takes the phone with them, it means they can monitor the run in real time.

The phone can store and analyse data from the fabric, showing the person’s route and how fast they are going.

The
 app provides a summary at the end of each session, showing your route, 
time, speed, heart rate and number of calories burned.

The garment, which is lightweight and washable, sends the information to an app on your smartphone via Bluetooth.

It means you can record your progress during the run and view a summary of your performance on your return.

It allows a friend or personal trainer to monitor you at a distance during a workout - a feature which may be attractive to marathon runners.

Product developers say the data 
transmitted by the shirt can also help indicate when the runner is 
pushing themselves too hard and risking imminent heart attack.

Stanislas
 Vandier, deputy chief executive, said: ‘For us, the future of the 
connected way of life should not be more complicated. It should be 
easier. So we are developing technology which does not require people to
 change their habits.

‘You never leave home without a shirt. So we are simply turning a T-shirt into a D-shirt.‘This is the first time it’s ever been done.

‘It will be no heavier than a normal shirt, and you can wash and iron it.

The D-shirt connects up to an app (pictured) that monitors all aspects of your jog. Here the app is shown in French - listing a user's journey duration, distance, heart-rate, calories burned, speed and level of fatigue

‘In the future, the same principle can be applied to all sorts of garments - from shorts to sports bras.’ The shirt is being showcased at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, with the first shirts going on sale in France in September.

French company Cityzen Sciences are currently in talks with British retailers and hope to release the product in the UK later this year.

The shirt, which comes in both male and female shapes, is made from a Smart Sensing fabric woven with integral micro-sensors.

They send the information to a small detachable transmitter on the back of the shirt, which sends transmissions to the smartphone via Bluetooth.

Obvious applications are for people who find themselves in extreme conditions, such as athletes, first responders, and soldiers.

Smart Sensing fabric costs around 30 to 40 per cent more than ordinary material and developers are now working on heat, respiration and perspiration sensors.

It is hoped that in the future, other factors such as blood oxygen and blood glucose levels could also be monitored using the fabric.

Company chief executive Jean-Luc Errant began working on the D-Shirt concept in 2003, later securing £16 million of investment to develop it.

Cityzen Sciences was set up in 2008, specializing in smart textiles conception and development working with a range of other companies.
