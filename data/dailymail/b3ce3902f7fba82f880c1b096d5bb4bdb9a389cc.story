A tiny woman with a huge appetite has started scoffing 8,000 calories a day, so she can pile ON the pounds.

Emma Dalton, 25, is a size eight with a 24 inch waste but eats four and a half pounds of chocolate, a pound of cheese and 26 pieces of fruit and vegetables every day.

And the 5ft 2ins account manager, from Bromsgrove, Worcs, is so food-obsessed that she has made it her mission to win every eating challenge in the UK.

Emma Dalton, 25, is a size eight but eats 8,000 calories a day. She tours the country taking part in eating challenges 

Emma's fascination with food started when she experienced the giant portions across the pond on holiday in the States in July.

After being teased at school for being 'lanky', she decided to up her calorie intake in a bid to bulk up and prove the bullies wrong, loading her diet with carbs, sweets and and vegetables.

Emma said: 'I'd always had a big appetite but I went on holiday to America earlier this year and realised I was actually a mega eater!

'Now I eat four times what the average woman eats – it's just part of my daily life.'

A meal can consist of two servings of lasagne and pudding, followed by 10 cookies, two chocolate brownies and four muffins and a slice of cheesecake.

Dinner is always followed up with 20 pieces of fruit, another large plate of vegetables and severanl snacking cheese portions.

But Emma is still just a size eight and weighs eight and a half stone. 

She has also decided to turn her appetite into a hobby, travelling around the UK and taking on eating challenges.

She has a 100 per cent record in her 'woman v food' battles since starting while on holiday in Orlando, Florida earlier this year.

Emma said: 'I tried out an eating competition in America and no-one could believe that someone so tiny had finished everything, and was ready for dessert.

'I've always thought of myself as too skinny and I got a lot of stick at school.

'Even though I'm eating so much now, I've only put on a little bit of weight, but I actually feel healthier than ever.

Breakfast: Third of a box of cereal and a piece of toast

Snacks: Packet of chocolate digestives

Lunch: Baguette sandwich plus fruit, yoghurt, three chocolate bars and packet of crisps

Dinner: Two servings of lasagne and garlic bread, large salad with six portions of fruit and veg

Dessert: 10 cookies, two brownies, four muffins, two puddings, and a slice of cheesecake

After dinner snacks: Plate of veg, 20 pieces of fruit, pack of Dairylea, three cheesestrings, and three Laughing Cow triangles

'And I really could just keep on eating. It's 8,000 calories and then some.

'It costs a lot to feed me though and I have to constantly top up our cupboards.

'But I love the fact that I can turn up to a restaurant, order their biggest super-size meal and wolf it down with no problem.

'There are 30-stone blokes that are beaten by them and I just don't seem to have a problem!' 

Last month, Emma Dalton, 25, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, took on the Wonder Cafe Challenge on ITV's This Morning show .
