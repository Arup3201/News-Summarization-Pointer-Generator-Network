Kevin Pietersen is eyeing a return to the England international fold ahead of the Ashes in the summer but he took time to enjoy himself behind enemy lines after the World Cup final on Sunday.

Australia recorded a seven wicket victory over New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to win the World Cup for the fifth time and despite his allegiances to England, Pietersen joined in with the Australia celebrations. 

The 34-year-old, who was out in Australia working as a pundit during the tournament, uploaded a picture to Twitter of himself taking in the party atmosphere with Australia fast-bowling all rounder James Faulkner

Australia's World Cup final victory is their fifth overall success in the tournament

Pietersen's post immediately drew a barb from former England team-mate Andrew Flintoff, who replied with 'Kevs the new John Terry' in reference to the Chelsea captain's celebrations after the 2012 Champions League final which he missed due to suspension.

Australia duo Mitchell Starc and David Warner were seen continuing their celebrations at becoming world champions well into the early hours at the MCG.

They were photographed at 2;15am local time on the pitch spraying what appeared to be alcohol over each other after securing victory over their World Cup co-hosts.
