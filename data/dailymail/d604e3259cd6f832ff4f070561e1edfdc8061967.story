In the aftermath of Osama Bin Laden’s death there was huge pressure for Barack Obama to release as many details as possible about the killing.

So it’s understandable that one politician feels rather peeved about Hollywood gaining special access to the secret raid in Pakistan for a film.

Rep. Peter King wants to know if Sony and director Kathryn Bigelow got too many details about the raid that killed the Al Qaeda leader in May.

The House Homeland Security Committee chair released Pentagon and CIA letters that consider how sensitive details should be given out.

The Pentagon letter said the inspector general's office for intelligence matters will look at how defence staff released information to filmmakers.

The CIA said its public affairs office is making a ‘single point of reference that will govern future interactions with the entertainment industry’.

Rep. King has expressed worries about the administration's cooperation with Sony Pictures Entertainment and 'Hurt Locker' director Ms Bigelow.

She has been working on a film with screenwriter Mark Boal about the dramatic hunt for Bin Laden following the 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S.

Ms Bigelow was forced to defend the Bin Laden film in August after she was accused of using it to get President Obama re-elected.

The timing of the film - and its close proximity to Election Day in 2012 - had angered some Republicans.

She openly supported President Obama in 2008, while he was campaigning for president and she was promoting The Hurt Locker.

Rep. King was worried in August when the New York Times reported that Sony and Ms Bigelow got ‘top-level access to the most classified mission in history’.

He claimed classified leaks over the raid had resulted in the arrests of Pakistanis believed by Pakistan authorities to have assisted the CIA.

The Pentagon and CIA’s role in the film was ‘bound to increase such leaks, and undermine these organisations' hard-won reputations’, he said.

He wanted details on talks among the 
White House, Pentagon and CIA about giving Hollywood executives access 
to covert military operations.

Rep. King also asked whether the film would be submitted to the military and the CIA for pre-publication review.

White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked back in August about Rep. King's call for an investigation into the matter.

Mr Carney said the White House did not give out classified details and his daily briefings provided its most specific information about the raid.

Ms Bigelow and Mr Boal said the film ‘has been in the works for many years and integrates the collective efforts of three administrations’.

Their hugely-anticipated film is expected to reach cinemas by the end of 2012 - which will be just 18 months after Bin Laden was killed.
