One of Britain's top police dogs who has sniffed out more than £11million worth of drugs, cash and guns has retired.

Springer spaniel Alfie joined Staffordshire Police in 2006 and his work with handler Julie Hargreaves has led to more than 400 arrests.

The nine-year-old, who was used by the force to sniff out illegal substances and stolen cash, was also used to educate schoolchildren about how to stay safe around animals.

Springer spaniel Alfie joined Staffordshire Police in 2006 and his work with handler Julie Hargreaves has led to more than 400 arrests. He has sniffed out £11million worth of cash, drugs and guns in his eight-year career

Alfie's handler said: 'He's the best dog I could ever have asked for - he constantly goes above and beyond'

Alfie was originally donated to Staffordshire Police by a family in Nottinghamshire after they found him to be too hyperactive. Ms Hargreaves has been his handler since he arrived with the force after his special training

Ms Hargreaves, 45, said she was sad to see her beloved partner retire but said she was immensely proud of the work they achieved together during Alfie's eight year career.

She said: 'He's the best dog I could ever have asked for - he constantly goes above and beyond expectations.

'It's difficult to keep count of the times that he has found things we had been desperately looking for with no luck and kept the community safe.'

During his eight years in the force, Alfie has sniffed out £8million in drugs alone.

During a raid on a car by the Central Motorways Police Group in August, Alfie came up trumps with one of the biggest single finds in history.

Police stopped a vehicle where intelligence suggested drugs may be concealed on board but officers searched the vehicle inside out and could not find anything.

It was only when Alfie was left to sniff around the car that he unearthed a large quantity of Class A drugs with an estimated street value of £4million.

His ability to smell traces of ammunition and weapon components means that Alfie has also helped to take guns off the streets with a total find value of £1million.

Alfie sniffed out one of the biggest finds in history - £4million worth of drugs during a car raid in August

After an armed robbery in Alsager, Cheshire, in 2011, Alfie searched the house where the perpetrators had hidden the weapons and managed to find them, which meant they could later be used in evidence.

In another search, he recovered more than £1million in cannabis resin from a container stored on a yard near Burton.

And, in a car where officers were unable to find anything, the springer spaniel was able to sniff out £500,000 worth of heroin and a further £250,000 in cash.

Thanks to extra training, he is also able to detect the special ink used to print money and can sniff out all sterling and euro notes. He once found a haul of £10,000 in cash believed to be the profits of crime.

As well as sniffing out illegal substances and cash, Alfie and his handler  also found time to work on education programmes for children.

The pair visited up to six schools a month teaching young people how to stay safe around animals and giving them their first introduction to the work of the police.

Alfie was originally donated to the police by a family in Nottinghamshire after they found him to be too hyperactive.

Ms Hargreaves, who has been in the police since she joined the cadets at 16, said: 'He was way too much for an ordinary family - a bit overzealous and hyperactive - but that's exactly what we look for in a search dog.

'He is ball crazy and that's the first thing we need - a dog who loves the reward of chasing a tennis ball.'

After being assessed by a team of officers, it was clear that he was perfect for the job and Alfie was inducted into the force with eight weeks of training with his handler.

She said: 'I was new to being a specialist dog handler too. Although I'd had a general purpose dog before, Alfie was my first search dog.

'He's turned out to be the finest dog the force has ever known.

'Both dogs lived with me - it's part of the bond between the dog and the handler.

The nine-year-old springer spaniel will now be cared for by the Staffordshire Retired Police Dogs Scheme

'And Alfie has always been 100 per cent professional - that's what makes him such a special dog - even when he was doing shift patterns.

'He did exactly the same hours as me, even when I was working nights or from the early hours of the morning.

'As soon as I put my uniform on, he was ready to work.'

Alfie retired in October and is being supported by the Staffordshire Retired Police Dogs Scheme now he is no longer in active service.

Ms Hargreaves said: 'Although I was very sad to see him retire I know he'll enjoy his new home.

'But I will be fundraising for the Staffordshire Retired Police Dogs Scheme to make sure he has a comfortable retirement.'
