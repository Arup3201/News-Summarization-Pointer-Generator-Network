An 18-year-old freshman found unresponsive in her dorm room at Indiana University in October died from an accidental overdose, her autopsy has revealed.

Abigail Bott, a twin from Clarendon Hill, Illinois, was found by a friend and staff at the McNutt Residence Center at 2.30pm on October 6.

The coroner said the overdose was not the result of alcohol and that no foul play is suspected in Bott's death. Officials would not release any further information about what exactly caused the death.

Emergency workers had attempted to revive Abigail after finding her, but could not. She was declared dead a short time later.

Bott had moved to Bloomington, Indiana, to start school at IU in August and had declared her major as health fitness.

In a statement released shortly after her death, her parents said: 'It is with the greatest of sadness that we acknowledge the death of our beloved daughter and sister, Abbey.

'Abbey passed away in her sleep on Sunday, October 6, 2013... We ask that you offer prayers for us and all those whom you hold dear.'

Abigail left behind a twin sister, Olivia, and brother, Neal.

She became the second freshman student to die at IU since classes began this fall.

she hit her head and died hours later from a brain injury.

Bott's friends tweeted out their remorse after learning of her death.

'To the girl who lit up every room, rest in peace... we now have another angel looking down on us,' tweeted Katherine Treankler.
