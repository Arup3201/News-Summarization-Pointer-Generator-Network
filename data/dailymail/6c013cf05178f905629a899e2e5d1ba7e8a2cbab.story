A man has been jailed for one year after stuffing his girlfriend in a suitcase and covering her mouth with a cloth when she dumped him, according to the People's Daily Online. 

The man, known only as Wang, tied up girlfriend Mu when she broke up with him at a hotel in the city of Xi'an in central China last June.

He then bundled her into a wheelie black suitcase, before paying drivers to take him back to his home in the city of Shenyang in Liaoning province. 

But he was caught when the driver heard Mu's muffled cries from inside the suitcase and contacted the police.

Wang promised his girlfriend he would 'treat her nicely' when they returned to his home city of Shenyang

Wang had been dating his girlfriend for more than two years when he asked her to relocate to his home town of Shenyang. 

He had promised his girlfriend he would 'treat her nicely' when they arrived and that he would hire a housekeeper. 

But when she rejected his advances, he hatched a plan to force her back to his home city.

Wang said: 'When I tied her up, I told her "I don't want to do this but after this small discomfort, when we arrive back home, I will use the rest of my life to treat you well. I will employ a helper so you can live happily."  

It was on June 15 last year when Wang tied up his girlfriend and crammed her 5ft 3in frame into the suitcase. 

When he had wheeled her to the front of the hotel, he told the driver to head to his home city after paying him 5,000 yuan (£542). 

But he was exposed when the driver heard his girlfriend's cries inside the case. 

Wang was arrested and taken into custody when the car reached Shenyang later that day. 

Wang was seen entering the hotel with Mu around 10am - five hours later he crammed her in a suitcase

Wang was filmed looking nervous as he exited the hotel trailing the heavy black suitcase behind him 

Following his arrest, police discovered CCTV footage showing him and his girlfriend walking upstairs in the hotel following their alleged argument.

The pair, who were walking metres apart from each other, could then be seen entering their hotel room just after 10am.

But around 3pm, Wang was filmed looking nervous as he left their hotel room carrying a small bag, as well as a suitcase containing his girlfriend.

He could then be seen straining as he dragged the suitcase down the corridor and out of the hotel's front doors.

In an interview with police, Wang said he and Mu were a couple, but confirmed that Mu had wanted to break up. 

The Xi'an New District People's Court said Wang had committed a serious crime of illegal detention, but after he confessed to his crime he was handed a one-year sentence.
