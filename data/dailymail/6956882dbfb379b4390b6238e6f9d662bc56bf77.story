His eerie green eyes peering out of the dark, this is the prime suspect in the case of the late-night break-in and the stolen meatballs.

When Los Angeles resident Joey Ball went to investigate noises coming from his garage at 3am one morning, he found himself face-to-face with a 500lb hungry black bear.

The animal was sat next to his open refrigerator, gorging himself on the contents.

Prime suspect: This is the bear which is believed to have raided Joey Ball's fridge at the dead of night

'There was food everywhere': When Mr Ball found him, the bear was feasting on frozen meatballs and tuna from this fridge/freezer in his garage

Terrified, Mr Ball locked the door behind him and fled back into the house to call the police.

'It was crazy!' he told KTLA News. 'He had steam coming out of his nose and food on his face.

'He had all these drawers laying around and there was food everywhere.'

The bear, which had entered the garage through an unlocked outside door, also tore through the freezer, eating tuna and Costco meatballs.

Well-known round these parts: Mr Ball in convinced the bear is the same one which has been visiting the neighbourhood regularly and which even took a dip in his pool last December

'As soon as I saw him, he looked at me and I thought uh-oh!' he added. 'So I locked the door on the dead bolt.

'You could hear him eating, slapping his gums.'

By
the time armed police arrived at the house in Glendale, the beast had 
made good his escape out a back door and into the hills - but not before
leaving a trail of footprints.

Glendale police, LA County Fish & Game officials and the Pasadena Humane Society are all on the hunt for the animal.

'I could hear him slapping his gums': Mr Ball fled the scene when he saw the animal staring back at him

Mr Ball is convinced it is the same bear he pictured lurking around his house in December.

He and his wife, Michelle, believe the bear had been playing on their children's swing set and even went for a dip in their pool.

Neighbours think it has been visiting the area after the 2009 'Station Fire,' which burned 163,000 acres nearby and compromised much of the area wildlife's habitat.
