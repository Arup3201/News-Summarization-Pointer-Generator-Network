Vladimir Putin's latest display of machismo has seen him plunge to the bottom of the ocean in a decidedly James Bond-esque manner.

The stunt-happy Russian leader -  who in the past has been pictured enjoying manly pursuits such as topless horse riding, fishing and hunting - has now released shots of him embarking on a half-hour trip to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland to see a shipwreck.

Mr Putin rode a small submersible craft which bears an uncanny likeness to the underwater hideout of James Bond villain, scientist and anarchist Karl Stromberg, in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me.

The President descended 60 metres (200 feet) down to see the remains of the naval frigate Oleg, which sank in 1869, Russian news reports said.

Mr Putin today rode the small submersible craft 60 metres (200 feet) down to see the remains of the naval frigate Oleg, which sank in 1869, Russian news reports said

The remains, being examined by marine archaeologists, lie off the island of Gogland, 110 miles west of St Petersburg

Unfortunately it seems the Russian leader did not find any treasure.

The remains, being examined by marine archaeologists, lie off the island of Gogland, 110 miles west of St Petersburg.

Mr Putin's penchant for adventurous stunts included a trip to the bottom of Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake, and a scuba dive in which he brought up pottery shards.

However, his spokesman later admitted the pieces had been planted.

He has raised eyebrows with his series of adventures over the years, always with a photographer at his side.

He has in the past been caught on camera firing a tranquiliser dart into a Siberian tiger, has sailed on military submarines, and even co-piloted a fighter jet.

He has also released a judo DVD: Learn judo with Vladimir.

However Putin's aides are also keen to promote his softer side.

Russia's hard man also pulled on a wetsuit and went scuba diving at an ancient Greek Black Sea site in 2011

Over the past few years he has been 
pictured painting for charity, receiving cuddly tiger cubs for his 
birthday, and denouncing the slaughter of baby seals.

The Oleg, a warship which sank in 1869 after colliding with another vessel, currently rests at a depth of 60 metres (200 feet) in between the islands of Gogland and Sommers.

It was reportedly discovered by Russian divers in 2003 and is now being examined by a team of researchers.
