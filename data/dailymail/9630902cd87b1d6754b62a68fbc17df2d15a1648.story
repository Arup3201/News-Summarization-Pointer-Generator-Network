Two policemen, three brothers, a fireman, a customs officer and an admin clerk. They formed part of the Gibraltar starting XI that lost 7-0 to Poland in their first-ever competitive match on Sunday night.

With a population of less than 30,000, UEFA's newest member Gibraltar didn't exactly have a wealth of professional footballers to choose from for their debut in this Euro 2016 qualifier.

Preston's Scott Wiseman  and Bnei Yehuda's Liam Walker were the only two making a living in football in the Gibraltar side, and could do little to prevent Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski from scoring four of Poland's seven.

But who are the others that  fit playing internationally around their day jobs? Sportsmail finds out. 

The starting XI: Gibraltar's competitive debut didn't go to plan, but the country has a population of just 30,000

A mixed bunch: Gibraltar's starting XI boasted two policemen, an admin clerk, a fireman, two pros and others!

Jordan Perez (FIREFIGHTER)

One day an international footballer, the next working the night shift as a firefighter. When Perez isn't defending his goal for Gibraltar Premier Division outfit Lincoln Red Imps, he's donning a fireman's outfit. The 27-year-old previously admitted he fits his life as a footballer around his shift patterns.

Scott Wiseman (PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER FOR PRESTON)

A right-back born in Hull. Wiseman qualifies for Gibraltar through his mother, and is rare in the fact that he makes a living out of football. The 28-year-old has been with Hull, Darlington, Rochdale and Barnsley, but currently plays for Preston in League One.

Joseph Chipolina (ADMIN CLERK)

Chipolina is a left-back for Lincoln, the reigning champions of the Gibraltar Premier Division for 12 years running. When not acting as an admin clerk, the versatile part-time footballer can be found racing down the left wing. He plays alongside his namesake and distant relative, Roy Chipolina.

David Artell (CREWE  ACADEMY DIRECTOR)

Artell plays for Bala Town, who finished eighth in the Welsh Premier League last year. The 33-year-old's role at former club Crewe, though, sees him act as the Academy's Operations Manager. And that's not all, Artell is a trained biologist, having previously studied at the University of Chester. 

Roy Chipolina (CUSTOMS OFFICER)

A customs officer for more than a decade, who was born in Enfield, north London. Chipolina captains the national side, and remains with Gibraltar's main club Lincoln. The 31-year-old  centre-back was charged with containing the threat posed by Lewandowski, who proved deadly for Poland.

Lee Casciaro (POLICEMAN)

Casciaro, Gibraltar's Sports Personality of the Year of 2012, is one of three brothers on the pitch. Lincoln won 12 consecutive league titles in his homeland, all while Casciaro got on with his day job as a policeman. Casciaro has also featured for Gibraltar's futsal team, too.

Rafael Bado (STOREMAN)

A storeman who plays in midfield for amateur football club, Lynx FC, in Gibraltar. The 30-year-old is reportedly gifted technically, but fell short of causing Poland a problem or two. Bado is a new feature to the national squad, and is reaping the rewards after Gibraltar won their 14-year battle with UEFA.

Ryan Casciaro (POLICEMAN)

Another Lincoln footballer in Gibraltar's top amateur league and, like his brother Lee, the 30-year-old spends his days serving as a policeman. This Casciaro is versatile, and can fit into defence or midfield for the national side.

Liam Walker (PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER FOR BNEI YEHUDA)

The second professional footballer of the team. Walker, a midfielder for Israeli club Bnei Yehuda, came with a recommendation from former Chelsea player Yossi Benayoun. One of the few players in the starting XI that boasts a compilation on the net from his time with Portsmouth in League One.

Brian Perez (ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT WORKER)

Little exists to tell you more about the midfielder that reportedly works in an electrical department. Made headlines, in Gibraltar at least, when sent off for shoving an opposition player in the face after scoring. Currently on the books of - you guessed it - Gibraltar Premier Division side Lincoln.

Kyle Casciaro (SHIPPING AGENT)

Gibraltar's main goal threat and the youngest of the three Casciaro brothers. International newcomers Gibraltar claimed their first win in just their fifth match after this particular Casciaro scored the winner against Malta. One way for the Lincoln forward to become an instant hero.
