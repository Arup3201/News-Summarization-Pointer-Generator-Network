Sixteen bottles of the world's oldest rum have sold for a record-breaking £135,000 after they were found in the cellars of a stately home.

The rum was made in Barbados 234 years ago and then brought back to Britain by aristocrat Henry Lascelles.

The Earl of Harewood had put 226 bottles of light and dark rum in the wine vaults of his family home - Harewood House in Leeds.

But despite the popularity of the spirit in Georgian times, the bottles were consumed surprisingly sparingly.

Despite the lavish parties hosted at Harewood House, just a few bottles were drunk a year.

And by the 20th century, rum became an unfashionable drink and the huge stocks of it in the cellar were forgotten.

The dust-covered bottles were only discovered in 2011, when Mark Lascelles, brother of the eighth Earl of Harewood, performed a stock check at the Grade II-listed property.

The cobwebs and mould were painstakingly cleaned from the hand-blown bottles and it was revealed they matched an entry in the cellar book from 1969, which stated there were 28 bottles of dark rum and 31 bottles of light rum left.

Twelve bottles of the rum were sold in February this year for £80,000, setting a new world record for the spirit, but now sale of 16 bottles - half of each type - surpassed it with a final total of £135,713.

This means each bottle of rum is worth £8,482, making it not only the oldest but also the most expensive rum in the world.

It is thought the rum comes from Barbados because the Lascelles family owned a lot of estates on the Caribbean island in the 18th century, including one that is now run by Mount Gay Rum.

It would have been distilled in Barbados then shipped in barrels back to Britain and bottled at Harewood House.

The light rum is almost 70 per cent proof while the dark rum is nearly 60 per cent.

David Elswood, international director of wine at Christie's auction house in London, said: 'The story behind this rum is fantastic.

'It was made at the Lascelles estate in Barbados in 1780 then shipped back to Britain in casks and bottled at Harewood House.

'But over the years it has been drunk very sparingly. The family only had a few bottles each year and the store just got forgotten about.

'Fast forward more than two centuries and members of the Lascelles family were making an inventory of what they had in the cellars when they found on the top shelf these mouldy bottles.

'They checked the cellar books and found to their amazement they were bottles of rum dating back more than 200 years.

'The rum is cask-strength and remarkably it tastes very good. Often spirits don't age well but this rum tastes fantastic.

'This is the most expensive rum in the world, and as far as we're aware it is the oldest too.'

The proceeds of the sale will be donated to the Geraldine Connor Foundation, which helps young people in performing arts and has strong links with Harewood House.
