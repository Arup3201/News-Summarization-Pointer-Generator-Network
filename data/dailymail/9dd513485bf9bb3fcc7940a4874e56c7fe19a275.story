An eminent hospital consultant died at a luxury care home where staff lied about making checks on residents, a coroner said.

Dr Rhys Tudor Williams was found dead on the floor of his room by paramedics in the early hours of the morning.

The 86-year-old, who had devoted his life to caring for others, should have been monitored every two hours.

But instead, in what the coroner branded ‘downright lying’, staff at the Sunrise Senior Living home – which charges fees of up to £50,000-a-year – admitted filling out time sheets recording when they looked in on patients in advance ‘to save time’. 

Dr Williams, of Didsbury, Manchester, had worked as a consultant physician at the city’s Royal Infirmary, and was an honorary lecturer. 

He was moved to Sunrise Senior Living in Bramhall, Cheshire, after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

His body was found trapped between his bed and the wall during a routine check in the early hours of March 4 – almost three hours later than he was supposed to be monitored, the court heard.

A post mortem examination found he had cardiac disease, and a pathologist said it was likely he had suffered a fatal heart attack and then slumped out of bed, rather than dying as a result of the fall. 

Staff were supposed to check residents every two hours, but a care manager admitted filling out the records in advance.

Stockport coroner John Pollard said that was ‘downright lying’ and added: ‘This is not a fair and true record of what has happened. In fact, it’s a total fabrication of what has happened.’

The inquest jury ruled that Dr Williams’ death was accidental but ‘aggravated by neglect’, as falling out of bed had ‘more than minimally’ contributed to his death.

A Sunrise spokesman said a staff member had been dismissed following an investigation into Dr Williams’ death, and a new management team and additional training had been introduced.
