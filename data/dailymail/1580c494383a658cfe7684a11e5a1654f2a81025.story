A midwife caught dosing herself with laughing gas in a hospital delivery room has been thrown out of the profession.

Fiona Midgley inhaled so deeply on the nitrous oxide at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, that she was overheard by colleagues.

They later heard her snoring as she had a quick kip on her rest break.

Colleagues of Fiona Midgley at East Surrey Hospital heard her inhaling laughing gas in the delivery room

Staff tried to wake her twice by knocking on the door but found it was locked.

When quizzed the midwife said she had taken the gas to help her sleep. 

She was suspended and made to carry out a 450 hour online learning course and write a 3,000 word 'reflective piece'.

But she struck again on May 6, 2013, when back at work, this time taking a 4mg tablet of the antihistamine chlorphenamine, which also has a sedative effect, from the drugs cabinet.

Midgley, who was not present but was represented at Wednesday's Conduct and Competence Committee hearing in Aldwych, London, admitted the charges and a string of other failings.

These included not flagging up that a patient's blood pressure had increased to senior staff and giving a patient the powerful painkiller co-codamol without recording it, all on May 16.

She also did not immediately transfer a woman who was 28 weeks pregnant with twins to the labour ward after being shown worrying signs her unborn babies were in distress.

The midwife, who was later cautioned by police for stealing cosmetics, fragrance and children's clothing from Boots, accepted her actions amounted to misconduct and impaired her fitness to practise.

Witness Helen Wickens, a supervisor midwife at the hospital, sent Midgley home after she used the Entonox equipment during a rest break.

Nitrous oxide canisters. The gas is often inhaled for recreation but its medical use is as a painkiller

The mixture of 50 per cent nitrous oxide and 50 per cent oxygen is supposed to be reserved for patients with a need for acute, short-term pain relief.

Entonox canisters contain 50 per cent nitrous oxide and 50 per cent oxygen for use as an analgesic 

Ms Wickens told the hearing: 'When I told Fiona she had been heard using the Entonox equipment by her colleagues she admitted it immediately.

'I therefore felt she should not remain on that shift and should go home but I wanted her to see a health professional first.

'As it was a night shift, the only place she could do that was A and E but she declined that, and I also offered her a taxi home but she declined that as well.'

Midgley admitted six separate counts of misconduct put to her. 

The panel found Midgley's fitness to practise currently impaired and ordered she be struck off the Nursing and Midwifery Council register.

Announcing its decision, panel chair Penny Griffith said she put 'vulnerable' women in her care at risk of 'significant' harm and did not provide 'safe, responsive and compassionate' care.

Ms Griffith said: 'The failures and omissions identified in this case were serious; some were far removed from the basic, fundamental standards of care expected of a midwife.

'We considered Midgley's misconduct to have placed vulnerable patients at unwarranted risk and she abused her position of trust

'The risk of significant physical and emotional harm to Patient A, Patient B and their unborn babies was great.

'Doing harm to others or behaving in such a way that could foresee ably result in harm to others, particularly patients whether deliberately, recklessly, negligently or through incompetence is unacceptable.

'The seriousness of the potential harm that the registrant caused to these patients coupled with the caution for dishonesty is incompatible with on-going registration.'
