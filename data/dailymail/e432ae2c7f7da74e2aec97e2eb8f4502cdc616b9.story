The Xbox 360 along with the PS3 are coming to the end of their lifespan and nothing shows their age more than a highly-demanding game like Crysis 3.

The multiplayer beta is downloadable now over at Xbox Live, giving players the chance to experience what the new Crysis will offer us. But sadly, for console owners, visuals look very similar to Crysis 2.

Packing some firepower: Crysis games have always pushed current gen hardware to their limits

Crysis 3 stretches the Xbox 360 to its limit. And while preview videos have shown it to be a graphical masterclass, the experience is simply not the case and reveals a vast gulf between consoles and what top-end PCs can achieve.

Still, if we focus our minds on the game at hand there is enjoyment to be had. The multiplayer beta gives players the chance to experience 2 modes; Crash Site, where two teams strive to control an area whilst the other goes bullet crazy to steal it, and Hunter where two super-powered players take on 10 others.  

Both game modes give players a taste of 2 different maps and the chance to customise the load-out of their character, allowing players to experience different weapons and abilities.

The maps have good variety and utilise the character's ability to jump up to different levels well.

For Crysis fans, this beta will no doubt whet their appetite a little more before its full release on February 18 in the US and February 22nd in Europe.

Now see it in action:

Initial impressions suggest graphics on console versions may not be a massive improvement on Crysis 2

Maps well designed and customisable load-outs work well

Crash Site and Hunter are both fun to play and there are lots of different abilities available to try
