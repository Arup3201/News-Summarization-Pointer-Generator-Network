They  could have charged admission fees to watch the street rugby in the Samoan village of Fatausi-Fogapoa during the summer. The Tuilagi clan were all back home together — playing for fun.

For Alesana Tuilagi, it was the only way of keeping his skills sharp during the best part of six months in limbo. Having hoped to join Newcastle in March, after finishing a two-year stint in Japan, the 33-year-old wing was hampered by a visa problem which delayed his arrival on Tyneside.

Facing a lack of competitive action, he settled for a resumption of sibling rivalry with his brothers including Manu, who had recently been in England colours taking on the All Blacks, before returning to the island of Savai’i to catch up with his family.

‘Back home, they’re always playing rugby,’ said Alesana, ahead of his first start for Newcastle against champions Northampton at Kingston Park. ‘We were playing touch rugby in the street, not contact.

‘I was just having fun with the family. Manu was there because he came home after England’s tour of New Zealand. All of the brothers were there together — we’re not all together very often like that. It was very nice. We had a few weeks together in Samoa then all went off to start the new season.’

While Alesana and three of his brothers, Freddie, Henry and Andy (Anitelea) — who has also joined Newcastle — have represented the land of their birth, Manu chose to play for England, where he honed his game as a teenager. The rest of the Tuilagi family are proud of what he has achieved but Alesana was not about to show too much respect when they played in their village, just as he doesn’t when they collide professionally.

‘Manu’s just the same,’ he said. ‘He stays with some old friends and they go outside playing touch rugby together. We were playing touch rugby together in our village at home. The other people there don’t watch us, it’s just full of kids playing. It’s good fun.

‘He doesn’t scare me! If we’re playing a game, we have to be physical with each other. We don’t back down or we will get injured. We just play the game normally when we play each other.’

From 2004 to 2012, Alesana was a stalwart at Leicester, the club where Manu remains as the last link to the Tuilagi dynasty. Two years ago, he left for a new challenge in Japan with NTT Shining Arcs and he embraced the chance to immerse himself in a different culture.

‘I was surprised when I went there,’ he said. ‘I lived 15 minutes from Tokyo and it’s a crazy place. There’s no diet there, the Japanese eat rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The rugby is different, the way they train is different; it was a different experience. They don’t have home or away games, they select stadiums around the country and you play everywhere. You play one game down south, another up north, but most are in Tokyo.

‘The standard there is good; they play a fast game and there are good players going there so the rugby is developing but it is a different environment. The rugby is going very well but the rules are different; they only allow two foreigners on the pitch and two on the bench, so I was playing for 40 minutes, then coming off. I have to get used to playing 80 minutes again.’

Having belatedly resolved his visa issues in order to return to the Aviva Premiership with the Falcons, Alesana has been playing catch-up with his fitness work after missing much of pre-season. In a quirk of the fixture list, his first competitive outing took him back to Welford Road, where the Tigers supporters accorded him the rousing reception he deserved, given his exploits for Leicester over so many seasons.

There was a time when that East Midlands city was home from home for a large contingent of the Tuilagis, who lived in two houses five minutes apart. But now the focus has shifted to the North East, with Alesana and Andy hunting for a house that can provide enough space for them and their families.

‘The family is getting bigger and bigger,’ said Alesana. ‘Of course they will grow up loving rugby and representing us as another Tuilagi generation in the game. They were born here and went to school here. They developed their rugby here so you never know. If they get a chance to play for Samoa, they will take it. If they get a chance to play for England, they will take it. The family are quite happy either way.’

Having been called into the starting XV by Dean Richards, he will go toe-to-toe with George North. ‘He is a big, strong man,’ said Alesana. ‘He is a great runner, scores tries and defends well. I will look forward to facing him. I just need to be in front of him all the time and not give him space.’
