Algeria’s impressive goalkeeper Rais M’Bolhi spent several days on trial at Manchester United, only for former manager Sir Alex Ferguson to pass up the opportunity to sign him in 2010.

The CSKA Sofia stopper was invited to Manchester United’s Carrington training ground for just under a week four years ago but failed to earn himself a deal under the watchful eye of Ferguson and goalkeeping coach Eric Steele.

It was around the time that United were on the hunt for goalkeeping recruits with Edwin van der Sar set to retire in the summer of 2011.

United target: Algeria's 'keeper could have been playing at Old Trafford is Ferguson made a different choice

Hero: M'Bolhi made a string of saves to deny Germany and take their last-16 tie to extra time

Sportsmail understands that M’Bolhi was considered as a back-up option but United eventually plumped for Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard, who joined in the following January. Newcastle also monitored the 28-year-old Algerian in 2010.

M’Bolhi was outstanding in Algeria’s final 16 clash against Germany, making show-stopping saves to deny Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger on Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, his German counterpart Manuel Neuer also came close to a move to Old Trafford, with the goalkeeper seriously considered by Ferguson before he decided upon signing Atletico Madrid’s David De Gea following Van der Sar’s retirement. 

Neuer, for his part, briefly flirted with the temptation of a move to Manchester United but had his heart set on a transfer to German club Bayern Munich.
