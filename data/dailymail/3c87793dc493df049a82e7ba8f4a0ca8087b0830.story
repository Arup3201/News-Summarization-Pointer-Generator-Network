Just for kids? Myleene Klass and her daughter Hero, in April 2011

Pity the friends and family of Myleene Klass. Not only do they get a choice of one lump or two when they visit her house for tea, they also get a choice of milks — soy, skimmed or the bikini model’s own.

‘Come on, it’s normal’, announced Myleene, 35, who has breastfed both her young daughters Ava, aged five, and Hero, two.

‘I made everyone try mine. It tastes just like those probiotic yoghurt drinks. Sweet — not as sweet as condensed milk.’

While most people would raise their eyebrows at the suggestion that stirring their host’s breast milk into their tea is ‘normal’, Myleene’s comments have highlighted how, in some quarters, breast milk is no longer considered just for infants.

There is, of course, the inevitable ‘yuck’ factor about the idea of drinking a bodily fluid that does not come pasteurised in a carton, like cow’s milk. Not to mention the feeling that turning a mother’s milk into just another food commodity cheapens and dishonours it, betraying the unique bond between the parent and her child.

But the unique combination of antibodies, living cells, enzymes, hormones and fatty acids in human breast milk has persuaded some enthusiasts that it is a superfood we just can’t afford to ignore.

Because, cringe-inducing as it might be, a growing number of adults are drinking breast milk, convinced that the health-giving benefits it provides infants with could prove an elixir of life for grown-ups, too.

In the U.S. its health-giving properties are taken so seriously that patients with cancer, digestive disorders or immune problems can obtain breast milk on prescription from a milk bank. All over the world, studies are being carried out to see how it can help with more advanced illnesses. In Australia, scientists use it to source stem cells to help in the possible treatment of diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.

Meanwhile, in Italy, components are being cultivated as possible ‘brain nutrients’ to boost mental function in cases of dementia, stroke or brain injury. There are also trials underway in California for a breast milk-based acne cream.

But while studies are looking to isolate some of breast milk’s amazing properties, there is growing concern about the unregulated market that is growing up around it on the internet.  

Since the first website offering breast milk for sale started in 2010, the trade has steadily grown, with thousands of pounds worth of unchecked samples now bought and sold every day.

In Britain, there are 17 officially accredited NHS milk banks, to which lactating women can make donations to help mothers unable to produce milk of their own. But rather than give away milk for free, many mothers are using community forums, including Facebook, to make some quick cash.

A quick glance at one British-based website shows dozens of women, from Essex to Newcastle, willing to sell breast milk — fresh or frozen — for around £6 for 200ml.

Supplies are not just bought by mothers who are unable to breast-feed, or who want to return to work and are no longer able to commit to the gruelling schedule breastfeeding demands. There is also demand from women and men who claim it will help combat medical conditions, as well as fans of a dubious culinary trend for using breast milk in products like cheeses and ice creams.

The women who sell their milk online are mothers like Claire Thompson, 21, from Glasgow, who last year sold supplies to make extra money while on maternity leave from her admin job and looking after her baby.

‘I had one call from a lady who wanted my breast milk for her husband, who she said was suffering from multiple sclerosis,’ says Claire. ‘Apparently, the nutrients and antibodies in breast milk can help people with MS, but just the thought of it made me feel a bit queasy, so I said no.’

But while some people see it as a panacea to all ills, there is also a risk of infection. In samples donated to milk banks in the U.S., one study found 3.3 per cent of donors had samples rejected after their blood tests showed up syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B and C. Kim Updegrove, director of a U.S. milk bank, warns: ‘Women are convinced that breast milk is somehow different from blood, and that there aren’t any risks in sharing it with another woman’s baby.

‘But it’s an incredibly risky practice. Breast milk is a body fluid. Would you consider cutting open a vein and giving a direct transfusion?’

Disturbingly, websites trading in breast milk make no provision for screening of donations. Experts at Cancer UK say that it’s particularly important that samples are screened for anyone who is tempted to take breast milk in an effort to repair their immune system after chemotherapy. 

A spokesman said it would be ‘crucial to make sure it was tested for any viruses’.

Quite separately, breast milk has also become the latest trendy ingredient in the continuing search for increasingly outré foods. The internet is overflowing with recipes for everything from breast milk crepes to rice pudding.

Businesses selling breast milk products include a trendy Covent Garden ice cream emporium, The Icecreamists, which recently launched ‘Baby Gaga’ ice-cream — a dessert made from human breast milk, mixed with vanilla and lemon, then frozen and served in a martini glass with a rusk. It was briefly banned by Westminster council because of health concerns, but has now been reinstated.

Child development expert Dr Rebecca Chicot of the Association of Infant Mental Health doubts that products made with human milk have much benefit for healthy adults, other than novelty value.

She says: ‘Human milk has been honed over thousands of years to provide babies with optimum nutrition. It also contains antibodies and human growth hormones, which babies need in order to support their immune system and promote their best growth.

‘However, ice cream and certainly cheese production involves processing the milk, so it’s unclear if it will still retain the properties in fresh breast milk. In any event, adults will not specifically “need” the ingredients found in breast milk as they have got mature immune systems.’

Breastfeeding expert Charlotte Young, founder of milkmatters.org.uk, believes that a lot of our squeamishness over adults drinking breast milk simply derives from the idea breaking cultural norms.

‘Most of us in the UK are happy to drink cow’s milk — from a random muddy cow in a field, but not the same species, which is a bit odd. Yet some Asian cultures find our mass consumption of dairy products, like cow’s milk and cream, icky.

‘I am more concerned that women selling breast milk for profit could result in fewer voluntary donations to the NHS. Premature babies who could otherwise be saved with it, may have to go without.’

Retired midwife and breast-feeding specialist Clare Byam-Cook, author of What to Expect When You’re Breastfeeding, says it’s disturbing that breast milk is no longer respected and reserved for its natural purpose.

In addition, she worries that the breast milk trade is fuelling the idea that all healthy women are overflowing with milk, and that there is something wrong with those who are not.

‘Lots of mothers hardly have enough milk to feed their babies as it is, let alone to sell online,’ says Clare.

‘Just like prize dairy cows, some women are genetically blessed with that ability. Others can only produce small amounts. Selling your milk online is a way for some women to boast that they’re good at something other mothers struggle with. There is a lot of competitiveness out there.’

Clare believes the mass market in human milk also distracts from the real issue: that not enough women are breastfeeding in the first place. ‘In this country, 65 per cent of babies are bottle-fed by the time they are six weeks old. Twenty per cent of women never try,’ she says.

Furthermore, by diverting breast milk from the very infants it is meant for, we could also be interrupting the bonding process.

After all, the simple act of a mother breastfeeding her child not only gives her child the healthiest start in life, the release of the hormone oxytocin in the mother’s body also creates a bond between them — something that should surely be sacrosanct.

Indeed, across civilisations and throughout history, breastfeeding has been considered to be the most intimate of acts; one which many mothers find deeply moving and personal.

As Clare says: ‘Let’s not forget that breast milk is, first and foremost, for babies. It’s a shame to commercialise something so precious and important in our children’s lives.’

The story of the Immaculate Conception may be familiar to churchgoers the world over. But it doesn’t usually involve an anteater. This rare biological phenomenon is the talk of the town in Connecticut, where a female anteater called Armani has given birth despite not having mated for 18 months.

As the anteater’s gestation period is just six months, staff at the LEO Zoological Conservation Center were initially baffled by the arrival, thinking it something of a miracle.

They have since discovered that Armani had an ‘embryonic diapause’ whereby an egg fertilised during her mating period was put ‘on hold’ in her uterus. Fortunately, the infant anteater Archie has suffered no ill effects for his time in storage.
