General Motors Co. is recalling more than 29,000 Chevrolet Cruze compact cars because metal parts in the air bag assemblies can hit the driver and passengers if the bags are inflated.

It is the latest of a series of 
recalls that have heaped humiliation on the 106-year-old car manufacturer 
and brings the number of models called back this year to 45 - totaling more than 20 million faulty cars worldwide.

The cars, from the 2013 and 2014 model years, were built with an incorrect baffle, and that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.

If that happens, metal fragments could hit people in the car, and the air bags may not inflate to protect them.

Baffling: The Chevrolet Cruzes were built with an incorrect baffle, and that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed

The air bags were built by Japanese parts supplier Takata Corp., but the problem is different from another air bag issue that's causing big recalls across the auto industry, the safety agency said Thursday.

GM had ordered dealers to stop selling new Cruzes on Wednesday.

Spokesman Jim Cain said the order for most cars was lifted later in the day when GM determined which cars were affected.

The Cruze, built in Lordstown, Ohio, is GM's top-selling car.

GM found out about the problem on May 
1, when a driver filed a lawsuit naming the company, according to 
documents filed with NHTSA.

The lawsuit alleged that an air bag in a 2013 Cruze deployed improperly and injured the driver.

General Motors has recalled more than 20 million cars worldwide this year alone for a variety of faults. They include the following:

February 7 2014 - GM recalls about 800,000 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 vehicles due to faulty ignition switches.

February 24 - GM adds 600,000 Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion and Saturn Sky vehicles to the recall.

March 28 - GM expands its ignition switch recall, adding 824,000 cars sold in the United States between 2008 and 2011 to the list. The switch recall alone covers 2.6 million cars sold worldwide.

March 28 - GM confirmed that one more death had been caused by the ignition switch problem, raising the total to 13.

April 10 - GM finds another flaw in the ignitions of the 2.6 million vehicles it has already recalled.

May 15 - GM recalls 3 million more cars - most of which were built before the automaker’s 2009 bankruptcy - due to a wiring problem.

May 16 - GM agrees to pay a $35 million fine to settle a federal investigation into why its ignition switch recall took ten years to deploy.

May 20 - GM recalls another 2.4 million vehicles, including late model editions of the Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia, for faulty seatbelts and transmissions.

May 21 - GM recalls 218,000 Chevy Aveos amid claims of overheating and fires.

May 23 - Japanese carmaker Suzuki recalls 184,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. that GM built for it in South Korea.

June 13 - GM recalls 512,000 cars, most of which are Camaros that can be accidently shut off while driving if the key is carrying too much weight.

June 16 - GM recalls about 3.4 million cars for the same reason.

Company engineers inspected the air bag and contacted Takata. GM told NHTSA about the problem on May 27.

GM sent Cruze air bags to Takata, and the company figured out what was wrong on June 20. GM decided to recall the cars on June 23, according to the document.

It comes weeks after GM was fined $35 million by NHTSA for its slow response to the small-car ignition switch problem.

Earlier this month, the firm urged drivers to remove key chains from their car keys after it admitted it needed to change or replace the keys for about 3.4 million cars because they could cause the ignition switch to move out of position if they are carrying too much weight.

GM said that the switches can rotate out of 'run' if the key has excess weight and the car 'experiences some jarring event', such as hitting a pothole or crossing a railroad track.

That can shut off the engines and disable power steering, causing drivers to lose control. Also, the air bags won't work. The recall affects seven cars with model years ranging from 2000 to 2014.

That recall covered the 2005-2009
 Buick LaCrosse; 2006-2014 Chevrolet Impala; 2000 to 2005 Cadillac 
Deville; 2004-2011 Cadillac DTS; the 2006-2011 Buick Lucerne; the 2004 
and 2005 Buick Regal LS and GS; and the Chevy Monte Carlo from the 2006 
through 2008 model years.

GM is already recalling 2.6 million older small cars, mostly in the U.S., for a similar problem where the ignition switch slips out of 'run' and causes an engine stall.

The $35 million fine came after lawmakers expressed disbelief at General Motors' explanation for why it took 11 years to recall millions of small cars with defective ignition switches, and also confronted its chief executive with evidence that the company dragged its feet on a similar safety issue in different vehicles.

CEO
 Mary Barra and attorney Anton Valukas, who recently released a 315-page
 investigative report into the recall, endured skepticism and some 
lecturing at a House subcommittee hearing. One member referred to the 
actions of some employees described in the report as 'insane.'

The
 GM recall has triggered a deeper look at ignition switches across the 
auto industry. The government has opened an investigation into
 reports of defective switches in 1.2 million Chrysler vehicles.

Barra made her second appearance before the committee since GM recalled 2.6 million small cars in February. As families of some of the people who died in crashes in Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions looked on, she was again pressed on whether GM's commitment to safety has changed much.

'Insane': GM CEO Mary Barra endured skepticism and some lecturing at a House subcommittee hearing where she was asked to explain why the firm has encountered so many problems. One member referred to the actions of some employees described in the report as 'insane.'

Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., read a 2005 e-mail from a GM employee who had a 2006 Chevrolet Impala stall on her after its ignition slipped out of position while she was driving it. "I'm thinking big recall," the employee wrote — but that recall never came until this week.

Upton asked Barra what GM would do with such an e-mail if it was sent today, and Barra said GM would take "immediate action."

Barra noted that GM has recently hired 40 more safety investors. But when she acknowledged that most of them were promoted from within GM, another member suggested GM get some 'outside fresh blood.'
