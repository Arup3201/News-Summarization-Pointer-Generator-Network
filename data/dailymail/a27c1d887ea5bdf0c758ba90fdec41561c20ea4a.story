She famously said she didn't want to follow in her mother's fashionable footsteps.

But it seems that Anna Wintour's daughter is still happy to take advantage of the invites she receives to designer fashion shows.

Bee Shaffer was the Vogue editor's plus one at the prestigious Yves Saint Laurent Menswear spring/summer 2014 show in Paris yesterday.

Family affair: Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer attended Yves Saint Laurent Menswear Spring/Summer 2014 show as part of Paris Fashion Week yesterday

The mother and daughter duo cut stylish figures as they graced the front row alongside the likes of Salma Hayek, Sky Ferrira, Milla Jovovich and Carrine Roitfeld.

25-year-old Bee (real name Katherine) has obviously inherited her mother's style credentials.

She looked bang-on-trend in a YSL baby doll pussy bow floral dress complete with nude heels and a gold clutch.

Her mother wore a monochrome dress with a pink cardigan, as well as her trademark sunglasses and coiffed bob.

Anna and Bee both seemed to thoroughly enjoy the show.

Charlie Potter from the Financial Times, said of the show: 'Slimane just steamrolls over the old system of editor approval and validation through coverage.

'His spring/summer Saint Laurent collection was an ever more extreme vision of a singular young man with intent.

'Consider
 the skin-tight trousers, often vinyl, always belted uncommonly high: 
Because they were paired with cropped jackets, the crotch was in focus. 
The models were young and thin, so this exposure was no power play.'

Queen of fashion: Anna Wintour (L) is fashion's most famous face but her daughter (R) said she didn't want to follow in her footsteps

Bee is Anna's daughter with ex-husband, child psychiatrist Dr. David Shaffer.

She was born in London, but moved to 
New York after her mother landed the job that made her the most famous face in fashion.

Her father divorced Wintour, after 
she allegedly had an affair when Bee was just 12.

Bee made a brief appearance in The September Issue, a 2009 American documentary film about the behind-the-scenes drama that followed Anna Wintour and her staff during the production of the September 2007 issue of American Vogue magazine.

Bee enamoured the audience by saying she wouldn't follow in her mother's footsteps and make a foray into fashion.

Front row regular: She may have told the audience on The September Issue that she wanted to go into law, but Bee certainly loves attending fashion shows with her mother

And while she said she wanted to study law, she clearly had a change of heart after landing her first job as contributing editor of Teen Vogue.

She continued to pursue a job in the media during her time at Columbia 
University and wrote a regular column for the Daily Telegraph.

After graduating from Columbia in 2009, she scored a job at College 
Humor website.

In 2011, Bee moved to the left coast of America to begin working for Glee creator Ryan Murphy’s
 production company, where a special role was created especially for her.

This isn't the first time that Bee has attended society events as her 63-year-old mother's date.

She accompanied Anna to the star-studded MET ball in May this year.

And it seems that Bee has more in common with her mother than just her sense of style.

As the fearsome editor of American Vogue, Anna, who inspired Meryl Streep's terrifying character in The Devil Wears Prada, is known for her fearsome attitude.

And she has even reportedly trained her daughter to impose a reign of terror too.

Speaking to The Telegraph about organising family holidays, Anna said: 'Bee is in charge of assigning bedrooms, and heaven forbid you treat her poorly, or you'll find yourself sleeping in a closet.'
