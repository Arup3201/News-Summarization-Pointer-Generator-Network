Manuel Neuer was at his 'fly-keeper' antics again during Bayern Munich's 4-0 win over Augsburg on Saturday.

Neuer charged 30 yards out from his goal to make a tackle and then chased up the loose ball before winning a free-kick for his side.

Arjen Robben scored twice to put Augsburg to the sword.

Robben claimed his first goal with a brilliant curling shot 60 seconds after defender Mehdi Benatia broke the deadlock in the 58th minute.

Robert Lewandowski sealed the result with a fine strike 10 minutes later with Robben wrapped up the scoring two minutes later.

Unbeaten Bayern claimed the symbolic 'Autumn championship' title as they will remain first going into the Bundesliga’s winter break.

Bayern Munich posted a picture of Neuer's antics on their Instagram page with the tagline: 'Typical Neuer' 

The defending champions stretched their lead to 10 points over Wolfsburg, who host Paderborn on Sunday.

Augsburg did well to frustrate the visitors and provided ample evidence of why it was third after the club’s best ever start to a season - up to Benatia’s opener.

The Moroccan defender scored his first Bundesliga goal with a backward header in off the far post from Franck Ribery’s free kick and Robben made it 2-0 by shooting in off the other.

Lewandowski shot low from distance for 3-0 and Sebastian Rode set up Robben for his second two minutes later.
