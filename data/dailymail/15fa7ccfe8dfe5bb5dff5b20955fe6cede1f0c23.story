An egg that was sent by a schoolgirl to troops in World War One and then returned to her in one piece has been discovered intact after 100 years.

Vida Sheppard from Frome, Somerset was 13 when in 1915, as part of a school project, she posted a hen's egg as a present for soldiers fighting in the trenches of the Western Front.

The youngster scrawled on the shell in pen her name, her school and a message which read: 'Health and luck to dear Tommy Atkins, God bless him'. Tommy Atkins was the slang term for soldier.

This is the remarkable egg which Vida Sheppard sent to a random British soldier serving on the Western Front on 1915, the solider Ernest Devall ate the contents before returning the shell along with a note for the youngster

Pte Devall, who was serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps returned the eaten egg in a tobacco tin

Several months later she received a package in the post containing a tobacco tin and, to her amazement, inside was her egg, minus the yolk.

The shell was signed by a Private E Devall, who had written his address as 'somewhere in France' and added 'returned with thanks.'

Accompanying the egg was a touching note from Private Devall, a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps, thanking her for the present and explaining his reasons for returning it.

In the letter, dated May 23 1915, Private Devall said he had sent the egg back as a 'souvenir of this terrible war' but only after eating its contents which he said he 'enjoyed very much'.

The letter continued: 'I hope that in the near future the Allies will be victorious. I must conclude thanking you for your kind wishes and please accept the same from me in return.'

Vida stuffed the egg with cotton wool to prevent it from breaking.

After the war she married Samuel French and the pair lived in Frome, Somerset. The egg was kept in her husband's smoking cabinet and on her death in 1977 it passed to her son Brian French.

The amazing tale has been told for the first time in a new book by Paul Atterbury, an expert on the Antiques Roadshow.

The youngster kept the egg and the note until she died in 1977 when it passed on to her son Brian French

The book, called 'Antiques Roadshow: World War One in 100 Family Treasures,' highlights stories that came to light in the making of the programme's WWI centenary episodes but never made it to air.

Mr French, 83, a retired civil engineer from Guildford, Surrey, said: 'The egg was always about in the house when I was a boy. I knew it was there but mum never talked about it.

'It was kept in my dad's smoking cabinet and remember taking it out and looking at it then putting it back again but I never really got the full story.

'It was obvious that my mother had written on an egg, send it off and received it back again but we never really talked about it.

'We think she had been asked to take the egg into school to be sent off to the soldiers because eggs were rationed.

'It was meant to be a morale booster for the troops.

'She wrote her name and school on the eggshell as well as a message saying "Health and luck to dear Tommy Atkins God bless him".

'Amazingly the soldier who received the egg then sent the shell back in a tin along with a letter back thanking her for her gift.

'I've always wondered whether he survived the war.

Private Ernest Devall deployed  on August 24, 1914 with the Royal Army Medical Corps  according to his medal card held by the National Archives in Kew, where he served with the No12 General Hospital in Rouen, France

'As I child I never really registered the significance of the eggshell - it was just something that was in the house.

'It's amazing to think now where this egg has been. It is incredible really that the egg shell has survived all this time.

'I'm very proud of it and it will continue to be passed on through our family.' 

Private Ernest Devall, deployed on August 24, 1914 with the Royal Army Medical Corps to the No 12 General Hospital which was based in Rouen race track in northern France. 

According to his medal card, Private Devall was awarded a 1914 star for enlisting at the start of the war. He was later awarded the British and Victory medals. He was later awarded a Silver War Badge which indicates that he was discharged from the army.

Unfortunately, it seems many of Private Devall's records may have been destroyed in 1940, but the lack of any notes in the remarks section of his medal card indicates that he survived.  

According to the Washington University School of Medicine RAMC General Hospital No 12, where Private Devall served was one first deployed to France at the outbreak of the war. 

The injured service men were treated in tents while administrators used the permanent buildings and offices. 

Only 60 beds out of 1,300 were contained within a wooden structure. The rest were under canvas, which regularly froze solid in winter.

Private Devall's hospital was one of the main receiving units for victims from the Battle of the Somme. After patients were stabalised, they were sent down the River Seine and back to England for recovery.
