Chelsea legend Frank Lampard is likely to play alongside a crop of Manchester City’s best young starlets when he joins new MLS franchise New York City.

Lampard, 36, is expected to confirm this week he is signing for NYC having been released by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho at the end of last season.

It is a huge boost for north America’s MLS which is gaining new respect after the recent performances of the USA in the World Cup and has attracted other big-name players like Thierry Henry, Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe.

The new season kicks off in early 2015 and Lampard may spend the intervening months in Australia on loan with Melbourne City.

Lampard scored a record 211 goals for Chelsea but his next club NYCFC is part-owned by Manchester City chief Sheikh Mansour. They have already signed Spanish World Cup winner David Villa from Atletico Madrid.

The club’s director of soccer operations, former Manchester City and USA star Claudio Reyna, acknowledges their relationship with the Premier League champions may lead to under-21 players from Manchester playing for NYCFC.

‘There are some very talented players,’ said Reyna about the Manchester City youngsters. ‘That could help us, all those things we're weighing up.

‘There's synergy between the three teams (also including Melbourne City FC), but nothing is being forced upon us at all.’

Among the youngsters who could be used are Swedish striker John Guidetti and 18-year-old Portuguese whizzkid Marcos Lopes.

Lampard’s future has been a source of great interest since he returned from the World Cup where he was England’s vice-captain.

His decision to move to America contrasts with Chelsea team-mate Ashley Cole who snubbed a Stateside move for another crack at the Champions League with Roma.

Lampard is already in America having left last week for a holiday in California.

NYCFC hope to play their home games in the iconic baseball arena Yankee Stadium which will host Manchester City and Liverpool on July 30.
