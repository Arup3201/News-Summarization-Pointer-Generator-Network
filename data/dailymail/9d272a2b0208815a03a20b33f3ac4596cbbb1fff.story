The move to Internacional in his homeland was supposed to be a fresh start for former Manchester United midfielder Anderson, but the Brazilian will want to forget about his debut quickly.

The 26-year-old, who once cost United £26m, signed for the Porto Alegre side earlier this month after cancelling his contract at Old Trafford following an eight-year spell plagued by injuries and questionable form.

And Anderson came off the bench in Internacional's Campeonato Gaucho fixture against Cruzeiro on Wednesday night hoping to impress, only to have his penalty saved by goalkeeper Bruno Gassi.

Anderson missed a penalty for Internacional as the former Manchester United flop made his debut in Brazil

With the score at 0-0, the 26-year-old came off the bench and slotted his spot-kick to the goalkeeker's right

But Crezeiro stopper Bruno Gassi guessed the right way and tipped the ball over as it finished as a draw

The missed spot-kick in the 74th minute would prove costly for the Gaucho champions, who went on to draw 0-0 at the Estadio Antonio Vieira Ramos.

After signing for Internacional the midfielder, who was snapped up by Sir Alex Ferguson for a big fee back in 2007 from Porto,  vowed to prove himself again.

However, at his presentation to the Brazilian media he prickled at questions over why he had spent so much time on the sidelines at United.

He said: 'Do you think I'm not fit? A player will always be criticised. I had injuries in the past, but I have to be quiet right now and answer in the field.

The former Porto man dazzled in Europe as a teenager and was once named Europe's Golden Boy

'I had a knee injury and returned to play too fast. I played, but the knees where not equal and I got myself injured again.

'It will be a pleasure play in a club such Internacional. I want to be happy as I was in other clubs.

'I'm coming back to Porto Alegre because Inter went after me. The president gave me attention. I was training but not playing.'I played for eight years for Manchester. I would like to thank the club. In my first four years I won.'

Originally a creative midfielder, Anderson was once given the Golden Boy award after dazzling in Europe as a teenager.

He has since dropped further back, and was criticised for being overweight during his time in England.

However, his penalty record with United was generally successful, netting his spot-kick in the Champions League final win against Chelsea in 2008.
