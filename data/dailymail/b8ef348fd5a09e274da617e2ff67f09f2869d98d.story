Royal Mail were blasted today after they banned deliveries to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears - over wonky paving slabs.

Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot.

Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'.

Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas

Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning.

The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch.

Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can.

'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.'

Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents'

Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue.

'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through.

'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right.

'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke.

'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital.

'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years.

'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.'

A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. 

Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago

Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent.

'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us.

'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance.

'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time.

'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too.

'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.'

Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. 

Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service

'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping.

'We are open to discussions.

'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.'

Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning.

'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago.

'Everybody's annoyed about it.'

A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping.

'Our priority is the safety of our people and we apologise to customers.'
