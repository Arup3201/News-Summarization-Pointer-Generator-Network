It's a time of year that sees millions of families get together to celebrate and exchange gifts - but relatives of Armed Forces personnel serving their country abroad will not get to pass on those presents in person.

Those families can still let their brother, sister, son or daughter know that they are thinking about them by sending a Christmas parcel to the front line.

And for personnel at the Army's transport hub at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, the hard work of playing Santa and making sure tonnes of festive treats reach Afghanistan in time has already begun.

Festive: A transport hub at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, has already dispatched 10,500 sacks of Christmas mail to Afghanistan this week

This week more than 10,500 bags of mail and gifts were dispatched and will arrive with serving soldiers before Christmas Day.

Lieutenant Colonel Brett Duxbury, of the British Forces Post Office (BFPO), said: 'As with every year, the Christmas post period is by far our busiest.

'Just this week we dispatched more than 10,500 bags of mail to operational theatres, which will arrive in time for Christmas Day.

'We do not underestimate the impact that mail from friends and family can have on morale and it is for that reason we make it our priority each year to ensure it arrives on time.'

The military's premier transport hub at RAF Brize Norton at Carterton in Oxfordshire is gearing up for its busiest time of the year.

Hundreds of service personnel are working hard to ensure that this mail is delivered alongside other vital supplies such as helicopters, armoured vehicles and life-saving equipment.

Logistician Corporal Daniel Smith, of 1 Air Mobility Wing, said: 'In the last two days more than 23 tonnes of mail has arrived at Brize Norton from BFPO, which has been loaded onto aircraft and is now en route to various operational theatres including Afghanistan.

'It's a challenging but important task ensuring it is all dispatched quickly.

'Having served in Afghanistan at Christmas last year, I understand how much value our boys and girls place on receiving post from people closest to them.'

This year, Army bosses have urged well-wishers 
to stop sending Christmas gifts to soldiers in Afghanistan - because they
are stopping packages from military families from getting through.

A torrent of gifts are sent to 
soldiers serving abroad each year, and while senior Army officials say 
that the gifts are greatly appreciated, they are clogging up postal 
system stopping letters from soldiers' loved ones getting through.

Instead, well-wishers have been asked to make a donation to a service charity this year.

Not only can the gifts delay 
morale-boosting parcels from loved ones, but the onward delivery of 
parcels to forward operating bases requires extra re-supply flights and 
convoys, which can place troops at risk from attack.

Mark Francois, Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, added: 'This Government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, particularly those deployed on operations.

'This is reflected in the Deployed Welfare Package, a key part of which is the safe and timely delivery of free personal mail from family and friends.

'In the past this mechanism has been used by the general public to show their support and resulted in huge volumes of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent, which have overwhelmed the in-theatre postal and logistics capability.

'Whilst unsolicited mail is well-intentioned, mail sent by families and friends is the most important to be deployed personnel and is our absolute priority.

'Moreover, unsolicited mail strains the logistics supply and prevents mail from families getting through.

'For this reason the Ministry of Defence will be repeating its unsolicited mail campaign.

'Rather than sending their own letter or parcel, I would encourage people to make a donation to one of Britain's excellent service charities.

'They might also consider 'uk4u Thanks!' - a charity that provides Christmas gifts to deployed service personnel.

'Once again I would like to say thank you to the British public, on behalf of the MoD and Armed Forces, for their incredible support of our serving personnel.'

uk4u Thanks! will for the ninth year deliver a Christmas box of practical gifts and treats to every soldier, sailor and airman deployed overseas - in Afghanistan and elsewhere - in time for Christmas Day.

Its parcels are delivered via the supply chain, meaning there is no impact on the mail network.
