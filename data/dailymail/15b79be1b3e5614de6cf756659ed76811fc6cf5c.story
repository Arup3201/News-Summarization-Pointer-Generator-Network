FIFA have been warned they face a ‘massive’ legal bill unless they tighten up concussion protocols after incidents at the World Cup where players have continued with potentially life-threatening head injuries.

Argentina’s semi-final win over Holland was overshadowed by  two players, Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta, being allowed to play on despite showing clear signs of concussion.

Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira was knocked unconscious against England but carried on after ignoring team doctors.

Flashpoint: Javier Mascherano stumbled to the ground after a sickening collision of heads with Georginio Wijnaldum

Cause for concern: Dirk Kuyt beckons for medical assistance as Pablo Zabaleta lies on the floor

Flat out: Diego Godin looks concerned as Alvaro Pereira lies flat on his back

There is 
now concern, following a multi-million-dollar legal bill paid out  to 
brain-damaged retired American footballers, that football is running the
 risk of court action.

‘FIFA need to get their house in order,’ said Sybille Steiner, partner 
at sports lawyers Thomas Eggar LLP. ‘Otherwise, it will only be a matter
 of time before they face a massive compensation pay-out,  or worse, 
tragedy occurs on the field.’
