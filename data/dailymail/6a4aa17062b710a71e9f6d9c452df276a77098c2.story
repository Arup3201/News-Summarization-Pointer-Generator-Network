Eathan Jackson-Cook woke on his 12th birthday yesterday to the news that his four year-old sister had died – leaving him the sole survivor of the crash that had already killed his mother and two other siblings.

Eathan, who had already lost his mother Keisha Ann, 30, brother Ryan, 10, and sister Joan, seven, on Friday night when their car slammed into a tree in Queensland, was then told on Monday that his four-year-old sister Matilda died overnight after being in a critical condition from the horrific accident.

As the only witness to the accident, Eathan, who is being cared for by his grandmother, is believed by police to be the vital link to discovering how the tragedy occurred, The Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak said investigators were working with the boy to reconstruct what happened in the final moments leading up to the family car skidding off a wet Sunshine Coast hinterland road and slamming into trees.

Supt Bosnjak said excessive speed was firming as the likely cause.

The road was not considered unsafe or dangerous for vehicles travelling at appropriate speed.

Eathan, who had been sitting in the front passenger seat, escaped with minor injuries.

He and his mother were wearing seatbelts but police say it is inconclusive whether the passengers sitting in the back were properly restrained.

The Courier-Mail believes a piece of Ryan’s T-shirt was found still attached to his belt, which could indicate he had it on but was ripped out sideways on impact.

A booster seat was in the back of the car for Matilda, but it is unclear whether it was correctly fastened.

Ryan and Matilda were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the car on impact.

Supt Bosnjak said Matilda, also known as Tilly, had been taken off life support yesterday and all efforts were being made to comfort Eathan.

'It’s his birthday today (yesterday) and they are trying their best to support him,' Supt Bosnjak said.

He said the family express its appreciation to emergency service workers at the crash scene.

Tilly’s father and the love of Ms Jackson’s life, Michael Cook, suddenly died of a brain aneurism a few years ago.

Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4,died in hospital

In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on.

'She told me "One of these days I’m going to die on this corner",' Ms Percival, 27, said.

Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident.

'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook

Eathan managed to escape the wreck after the accident on Friday night and flag down motorist, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, reported the Northern Star.

'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said.

Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman, that he had managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark.

They discovered seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'.

Ethan was covered in blood, grass and mud when he flagged down some cars for help, according to witnesses, before he led them back to the scene were his mother (pictured) and siblings had been killed

She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene.

Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts.

'There are several factors we are looking at, particularly speed, they are awaiting toxicology reports which will take some time to establish if there is anything in that regard to look at,'Acting Superintendent John Boznjak said told Sunshine Coast Daily.
