Worlds collided in the nation's capital last night, as President Obama shared a meal with the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan at the 98th annual White House Correspondents' Dinner.

The president enjoyed a genial evening with the members of the press, thanking them for their time and dedication.

Nothing was off limits during Washington’s night of levity, including the recent Secret Service scandal in Colombia, 'dog socialism', and the state of media today. And of course, he didn't shy away from the political arena.

Comedian-in-chief: President Obama was in fine form Saturday night and delivered a comedy routine that left the audience in stitches. No one was safe from mockery, including the shamed Secret Service and likely GOP adversary Mitt Romney

The president appeared in high 
spirits as he began his comedic routine. ‘We gather during a historic 
anniversary,’ he said. ‘Last year at this time, in fact on this very 
weekend, we finally delivered justice to one of the world’s most 
notorious individuals.’

That man wasn't Osama bin Laden - no, a picture of none other than Donald Trump flashed on the screen.

Speaking of Trump, Obama invoked the birther debate by announcing that his mother was born in Kansas, his father was born in Kenya and he himself was born in Hawaii (with a wink to the crowd).

He then thanked members of Congress, for taking a break from their ‘exhausting schedule of not passing any laws’ to show up for the dinner.

Weeks after Sarah Palin co-hosted the Today show, Obama took a dig at Mama Grizzly and himself at the same time, asking the audience, 'What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious!'

Jabs at his likely GOP rival Mitt Romney came soon after.

‘I’m not going to attack any of the 
Republican candidates - take Mitt Romney,’ the president deadpanned, 
adding that the former Massachusetts governor would call the luxurious 
Hilton ballroom 'a little fixer-upper.'

He continued: '[Romney] and I actually have a lot in common… We both have degrees from Harvard. I have one, he has two.’ After a pause, he added: ‘What a snob.’

Four years ago, Mr Obama recalled, he was 
locked in a tough primary fight with Hillary Rodham Clinton, now his 
secretary of state.

'Now she can't stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena,' he
 said, referring to their recent trip to the Summit of the Americas in 
Colombia, where Clinton was photographed drinking a beer and dancing.

But the attacks were not just for his rivals on the other side of the political aisle, as Obama spent some time mocking his own appearance, noting how his hair has greyed in the four years since he took office, and displayed a photo of Morgan Freeman to illustrate how he'd look after another four years.

Next up was a video satirising Mr 
Romney’s highly politicised event of strapping his dog Seamus to the 
roof while on home from a family vacation.

The first lady was wearing a modified version of Naeem Khan’s paisley organza ball gown from the Fall/Winter 2011 collection (seen above). The version that went down the runway had a strap over the left shoulder.

In the faux-political video, the 
announcer hinted at what a horrible world it would be if 'socialist' 
first dog Bo Obama were allowed another four terms in office.

'America’s dogs can’t afford four more years of Obama - that’s 28 years for dogs.'

The video 
finished with the slogan: ‘I’m an American, and dog gone it, I ride on 
the outside. (Paid for by the Wolf Pack of America).'

Throughout the routine, Mrs Obama could be seen laughing at the dinner table. The first lady was wearing a modified version of Naeem Khan’s one-shouldered paisley organza ball gown from the Fall/Winter 2011 collection.

The version that went down the runway had a twisted strap over the left shoulder, but Mrs Obama seemed to prefer a dress that better displayed her décolletage.

She accessorised the look with detailed gold hoop earrings and a loosely-waved bob, as well as a large cocktail ring worn on her left hand.

The first lady also elected to wear a bright pink lipstick to match the colours of her gown.

Earlier, the president gave a knowing
 nod to several instances 
of 'hot microphone' instances, lampooning himself in a monologue, asking
 who the Kardashians are, and why exactly they're famous.

'What am I doing here,' he asked off stage. 'I'm opening for Jimmy Kimmel and telling knock-knock jokes to Kim Kardashian.'

A toilet flush was then heard just before the commander-in-chief was formally introduced.

The
 crack drew a thumbs up from former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum, who
 dropped out of the presidential primary campaign earlier this month.

Santorum had called Obama a snob for encouraging young Americans to 
attend college.

But Mr Obama touched on serious 
themes as well, remembering The New York Times' Anthony Shadid and Marie
 Colvin of the Sunday Times of London who died while covering the 
uprising in Syria.

'Never forget that our country depends on you to help protect our freedom, our democracy and our way of life,' he said.

Then he returned to the lighter side: 'I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew.'

The president then passed the podium on to ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who he noted got his start on a programme called The Man Show.

‘In Washington, that’s what we call a congressional hearing on contraception,’ he said.

Kimmel began joking straight out of 
the gate, saying: ‘It’s an honour to be here. Mr President, remember 
when the country rallied around you in the hopes of a better tomorrow?

'That was hilarious. That was your 
best one yet. There’s a term for guys like President Obama. Probably not
 two terms, but there is.’

No one was safe from the wry jokes of the outspoken host of Jimmy Kimmel Live.

He
 poked fun at everyone from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ('I think
 you’re misunderstanding New Jersey’s slogan. It’s not the Olive Garden 
State') to Newt Gingrich (‘It’s great to see the Gingriches here, 
because that means the check cleared') to Arianna Huffington (You deserve [the Pulitzer Prize], Arianna.  There's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard-hitting journalism that HuffPo is linking to every single day).

He also picked up on the Secret 
Service prostitution scandal in Colombia, saying he told the Secret 
Service that for $800 he wouldn't joke about them, 'but they only 
offered 30.'

'If this had 
happened on President Clinton's watch, you can damn well bet those 
Secret Service agents would have been disciplined with a very serious 
high five,' Kimmel said.

Among those who attended Saturday 
night's dinner were former Secretary of State Colin Powell, the cast of 
the hit TV show 'Modern Family,' singer John Legend, actor George 
Clooney, Army Chief of Staff Gen Ray Odierno, House Majority Leader 
Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, director Steven Spielberg, and actress Zooey 
Deschanel.

Proceeds from the dinner go toward scholarships for aspiring journalists and awards for distinction in the profession.

The association was formed in 1914 as a liaison between the press and the president.

Running the gamut: The president displayed a range of emotions during the course of the night

Every president since Calvin Coolidge has attended the dinner. Some of the proceeds from the dinner pay for journalism scholarships for college students.

Several journalists were also honored at the dinner, including:
