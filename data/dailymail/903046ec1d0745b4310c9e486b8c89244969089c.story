Spotted at the age of 57 by a professional photographer who spied her posing for photos with her grandchildren, Sarah Wiley had never considered becoming a fashion model before then.

Snapped up by London-based agency Close Models, Wiley, now 65, has since appeared regularly as a glamorous clothes horse for This Morning, as well as on Gok Wan's How To Look Good Naked and for retailer John Lewis.

But she's not alone. Wiley, who appeared in Stella magazine's latest beauty shoot for the Telegraph about using make-up on aging skin, says she's one of a 'whole gang' of older women being papped by fashion editors and designers.

Sarah Wiley, 65, was only scouted as a model when she was spotted by a professional photographer at the age of 57

Speaking to Rena Niamh Smith for Stella, the former ballerina explained when she got 'spotted' she agreed to do a simple lifestyle shoot, just for fun, with the photographer

Other members of the group include veteran model Carmen Dell'Orefice, 82, 85-year-old Daphne Selfe, and Jenni Rhodes, 81.

Speaking to Rena Niamh Smith for Stella, the former ballerina explained when she got 'spotted' she agreed to do a simple lifestyle shoot, just for fun, with the photographer.

She initially thought the idea was a wind-up, only to be told at the end that she was quite the natural in front of the camera.

Saddened that her 10-year-old granddaughter is given the impression by magazines that in order to be successful a woman must be thin, Wiley wishes to challenge traditional idea of 'beauty'.

She says: 'It's the interest in someone's face 
that makes them arresting. Being alive, being interested in 
the world around you.'
