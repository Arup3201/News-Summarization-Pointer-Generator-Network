It is cheaper to buy a home than rent one with buyers £900 a year better off, a study has revealed

The research found the average monthly mortgage payment has risen to £672 while rents have gone up to £745 over the same period.

Buying is now 10 per cent cheaper than renting, according to the report by Halifax, the UK's biggest lender. But young people are still struggling to find deposits.

For sale and to rent: Buyers are better off by an average of £900 a year than those who rent according to a study by Halifax

The turnaround has been caused by two factors - falling house prices and low mortgage rates, which have been pushed even lower by the government's flagship Funding for Lending scheme to kick-start the housing market.

The average mortgage rate for a new borrower has dropped from 5.88 per cent in June 2008 to 3.57 per cent by June this year.

Average house prices, despite a strong recovery in the past three years, remains 13 per cent below prices in 2008.

Rents have risen because of strong demand by young people, many of whom cannot afford to buy their first home in the tough economy.

                                 BUYING             RENTING                % DIFFERENCE                   £ DIFFERENCE

June 2008                £1,072                     £720                                    49 per cent                                    £352

June 2009                £775                         £697                                    11 per cent                                     £78

June 2010                £676                         £657                                     3 per cent                                       £19

June 2011                £668                          £693                                    - 4 per cent                                    - £25

June 2012                £650                         £728                                    - 11 per cent                                   - £78

June 2013                £672                         £745                                    -10 per cent                                   - £73           

Martin Ellis, economist at Halifax, 
said the findings suggested it was a 'no-brainer' to buy for those who 
could afford the deposit.

He
said: 'We understand that building a deposit is still a key challenge 
for those looking to get on the ladder but if they can get over that 
hurdle, it's cheaper now to buy,'

The study - based on a three-bedroom house - took into account typical costs like income lost by finding a deposit rather than saving, household maintenance and repair and insurance costs.

People living in London and Northern Ireland have the most to gain from buying, the research suggested, while the gap between the two is biggest in Northern Ireland, around 11 per cent.

Looking for a home: Saving for a deposit is the biggest hurdle for couples who have to rent

Buying in Northern Ireland costs an average £369 a month, while renting is £415.

Londoners do best from getting on the first rung of the property ladder, with a saving of almost £100 a month.

Wales and Yorkshire and the Humber were the only areas of the UK where renting was found to be more affordable than buying. In Scotland, buying was £27 a month cheaper than renting.

Halifax findings reveal the average age of a first-time buyer is now 30, up from 29 in 2011, with parents helping couples save the deposits.

Mr Ellis told the Daily Telegraph:' 'A combination of lower mortgage rates and declining house prices has substantially reduced the cost of buying over the past six years.

'Nevertheless, the number of home buyers in the twelve months to June 2013 was nearly half of that in 2008, which will have been constrained by worries over job security.'
