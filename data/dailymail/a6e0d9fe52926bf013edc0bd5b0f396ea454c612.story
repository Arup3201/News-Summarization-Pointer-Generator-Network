It's a revival of a period drama classic, so the seven million viewers who tune in to BBC1’s new hit Poldark would be forgiven for thinking they had seen some of the characters before. 

But, as these pictures show, it’s not just the 1970s original that the new cast bear uncanny similarities to... 

Ross Poldark's first love Elizabeth, as played by Heida Reed, shares the cool beauty and brunette tresses of Dancing On Ice host Christine Bleakley, the fiancee of footballer Frank Lampard. The One Show, which Christine used to present, just became The Two Show...

Handsome leading man Aidan Turner oozes the same rugged, brooding sex appeal of tragic INXS frontman Michael Hutchence in his portrayal of Captain Ross Poldark.

The Australian rocker may have sung Never Tear Us Apart… but in this case Never Tell Us Apart might be more accurate.

He might not be known for having the voice of an angel, but actor Kyle Soller, who plays Francis Poldark, still resembles choirboy-turned-broadcaster Aled Jones.

Just don’t try to imagine him singing Walking In The Air in a dubious Cornish accent... 

Poldark’s drunken servant Jud Paynter and his buxom wife Prudie have a couple of comedy doppelgangers. 

What a couple: Podark's servant and his wife look similar to a couple of other familiar characters (below)

Albert Steptoe, played by Wilfrid Brambell and Beatie Edney, aka Dawn French, could be mistaken for Poldark characters Jud and Prudie Paynter (above)

Phil Davis’s scoundrel resembles sitcom rag-and-bone man Albert Steptoe (Wilfrid Brambell), and Beatie Edney looks like Vicar Of Dibley star Dawn French as she appeared in Lark Rise To Candleford. 

Edney is actually the daughter of another acting icon – Sylvia Sims.

As volatile Captain Blamey, Richard Harrington is a million miles from laid-back charmer Des O’Connor. 

But put them both in a waistcoat and cravat – as Des wore on stage in The Wizard Of Oz – and the similarities are more obvious.

Performers: Not alike in character but Captain Blamey ot Richard Harrington and Des O'Connor are not too different in a waistcoat and cravat

Fiery, flame-haired and prone to scandalising polite society, Poldark temptress Demelza, Eleanor Tomlinson, bears more than a physical similarity to Christine Keeler, the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 Profumo affair.

It looks like Farthings are actually two-a-penny, as Jack Farthing - who plays George Warleggan, channels the spirit of Hugh Grant in the 1995 film version of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility.

In his last screen role, late acting heavyweight Warren Clarke is positively Churchillian as the imposing patriarch Charles Poldark...though sadly it's the animated insurance-selling dog he resembles rather than Britain's greatest Prime Minister. Oh, no? Oh, yes...

Oh yes: Late actor Warren Clarke has a barking similarity to the Churchill the cartoon dog
