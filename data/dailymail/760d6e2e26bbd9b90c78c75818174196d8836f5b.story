A young boy was in need of a fix that only his local pub could provide.

Filmed at home in London, the 20-month-old boy named Max stands in front of his mother with tears streaming down his cheeks.

He urges her and his father to take him to the local pub - where he usually receives sweets and hot chocolate - instead of the doctor's surgery.

After allowing him to catch his breath, his mother asks him to tell his father – who is presumably the recipient of the recording – why he is crying.

Choosing to ignore her question, the youngster carries on snivelling, so his mother asks him: ‘Where do you want to go?’

The boy replies with the rather blunt and humorous answer, ‘Pub’, to which his mother retorts: ‘No, but we have to go to the doctors.’

Refusing to back down, Max continues to suggest the pair go the pub until his mother offers a compromise.

When his mother asks Max where it is he wants to go he hilariously replies by saying 'pub'

She says: ‘OK, you know what? When daddy gets home we will ask him. We will ask him if you can go to the pub later.’

Please with her response, although not entirely convinced, the youngster immediately reminds his mother to ask.

According to Max’s father, Oliver Bath, he normally takes his son out of the house and down to the local pub  to give Max's mum some peace and quiet.

He said: ‘I always get a beer and Max always gets his hot chocolate.

‘True to the principles of Pavlov’s dog Max now associates sweets and hot chocolate with the pub.

‘My guess as he gets older he'll feel the same but his choice of chocolate will move to his choice of cask ale.’
