Sam Burgess ensured he'll leave the South Sydney Rabbitohs with an indelible place in the club's folklore after playing almost the entire NRL Grand Final with a fractured cheek bone.

The England forward, playing in his final NRL match before moving to Bath in the Aviva Premiership, clashed heads with countryman James Graham in the opening minute after taking the first hit-up of the match against Canterbury-Bankstown.

His heroics were made all the more sweet as the Rabbitohs went on to claim their first title in 43 years with a dominant 30-6 victory over the Bulldogs. It was later confirmed Burgess is to undergo surgery.

Burgess got up from that initial contest spitting blood but played on in a move reminiscent of Rabbitohs great John Sattler, who famously broke his jaw in the third minute of the 1970  final.

Straight away Burgess appeared to inform trainers that his cheekbone or jaw had been damaged.

And he confirmed the case on his way off the field at half-time when asked by Channel Nine commentator Brad Fittler how his cheek was.

Burgess replied: 'It's f---ed. It's gone.' 

After the drought-breaking win, he added: 'I knew I'd broke it straight away. The side of my face just felt numb. My head was a little bit dizzy and I had a bit of blurred vision. But we just covered for each other and there were a lot of guys out there helping me through it. There was not a chance I was missing out.'

Despite obvious discomfort Burgess was immense in the first stanza, making 113 metres, two offloads, a tackle break, 18 tackles without missing a single one and 13 runs, the most of the half.

The Rabbitohs' job was far from done at the break with a slender 6-0 lead courtesy of an Adam Johnston try and a penalty from Adam Reynolds, and Burgess returned to continue bossing the forwards battle in the second period.

The Bulldogs hit back with a try to Tony Williams, converted by Trent Hodkinson, but the Bunnies were back in the lead after a bulldozing run and try from Sam's brother George.

Another conversion and then a penalty for Reynolds took the score to 14-6, before tries from Kirisome Auva'a, Reynolds and finally Inglis in the closing 10 minutes saw the scoreline blow out.

Burgess broke down in tears even before the final whistle blew with the Rabbitohs locking up the title 30-6 with a late flurry of tries.

When Greg Inglis crossed in the last play of the game 'Slammin' Sam' was offered the conversion attempt from the sideline and only narrowly missed his kicked to the left of the upright.

Asked if he'll be missing out on the Rabbitohs' Mad Monday victory celebrations, Burgess said: 'I'd imagine so. The doc seems to be thinking surgery ... We'll see how it goes, but I'd imagine I'll be getting it fixed in the next 24 hours. I guess the joy is overriding the pain at the moment.' 

'I wasn't really listening to what (the doctor) was saying. The teammates really helped me through the process. I'm just really happy for the team ... it's been a great effort all year.'

There was no animosity between Burgess and Graham, who in the aftermath of the match has been painted the villain to his opposite number's hero. 

'James is a great competitor and I've got a lot of respect for him as a guy and a competitor. I just told him [at fulltime] I'm going to miss him. He's a friend I'll have forever, but that's all that was said.'
