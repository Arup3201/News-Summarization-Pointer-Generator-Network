Cian Healy isn't one to mess about on the rugby field, but he's certainly been having some fun off it.

The Irish prop posted a video to his Instagram account of him shaving his beard in different stages.

A goatee, a handlebar moustache, a French-style 'tache-and-beard combo and even half a moustache make an appearance before Healy goes fully clean-cut.

Big hitter: Healey runs into England's Luther Burrell and Jack Nowell on Six Nations duty with Ireland

Starting out big: It's a pretty normal showing from Cian Healy in the first shot

Getting the chop: Healy's beard is pretty full in the first few shots

Bye bye facial fuzz: Slowly but surely more hair makes a disappearing act

Funny faces: The Irish prop pulled out a huge repertoire of facial expressions

Losing it: As the video goes on, more hair disappears from the Lions man's face

All but gone: No more beard and just the slightest of 'tasches for Healy here

Odd finish: Healy's final stage saw just the tiniest bit of 'tasche left

Healy's video will come as no surprise to regular followers of the Leinster loosehead prop - he often shows off on his Instagram and even occasionally DJs under the alias 'DJ Church'.

The Irishman may have to fill his time for now but it won't be long until he is back in action with his club, and they face Northampton Saints in their season opener.

Healy might no longer have the facial fuzz - aside from half a moustache that you would hope he saved off - but there's still plenty of time to growing it back before he kicks off the new campaign on August 23.

Key: Healey has played for the British and Irish Lions as well as his country
