Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football. This week includes Arsenal's Jack Wilshere making good his promise to play more attacking football, Wes Brown doing his best Ryan Shawcross impression and Tony Pulis making a case in defence of Palace.

1) Jack Wilshere said his New Year’s resolution was to prove he’s an attacking midfield man – and he’s true to his word.

He followed up a goal and an assist at Villa by setting up one of Santi Cazorla’ s double against Fulham and made three more chances. Some 76 of the massive total of 106 passes he played in the game were in the opposition’s half of the field.

Wil power: Jack Wilshere has kept true to his New Year's resoultion of playing more attacking football

Pulis makes case for the defence

2) Converted defender Joel Ward and 
skipper Mile Jedinak have become the rocks on which Crystal Palace’s 
attempt at survival are founded.

Since Tony Pulis paired them up in front of his back four, the Eagles have conceded just four goals in six games.

The
 security blanket they put in front of the defence meant that of Stoke’s
 17 attempts on goal, only three of them were from inside the penalty 
area.

In fact since Pulis took charge at Selhurst Park only Arsenal have kept more clean sheets.

3) Swansea out passed Tottenham with 642
 passes against 499, and had more of the ball in both halves (55.3% and 
57.2%), but still got battered 3-1.

Sadly
 that is a recurring theme for Michael Laudrup’s side who are great to 
watch but find themselves flirting with relegation just three points out
 of the drop zone.

The
 Swans have had more possession and made more passes than their 
opposition in every one of the 14 games they have failed to win this 
season.

9/10s of the law? Swansea players dejected after losing to Tottenham - they have had more possession in all 14 games they have lost

Brown does his best Shawcross impression

4) Wes Brown is in danger of becoming 
the new Ryan Shawcross of a few years back – whole hearted rather than 
nasty but still too reckless for the good of himself and whoever he’s 
against.

The
 Sunderland defender was sent off at Stoke for a challenge on Charlie 
Adam (although that was rescinded on appeal), and then again against 
Norwich for a reckless tackle on Ricky Van Wolfswinkel.

That
 means his tackle that put Southampton’s Dejan Lovren on a stretcher was
 the third serious incident he’s been involved in, in just 14 games 
since himself returning from a bad injury.

5) Aston Villa became the first Premier 
League side to wrack up more than 50 bookings this season with four 
cautions in the game at Liverpool.

Manager
 Paul Lambert insists it is a result of over enthusiasm from young 
players rather than any deliberate plan to go out kicking people.

Ryan
 Bertrand got his loan spell started by collecting one of them, meaning 
Villa have had 52 yellows in all – five more than Stoke.  Manchester 
United are third with 44 – of which Wayne Rooney has contributed seven.

It was all yellow: New signing Ryan Bertrand contributed to Villa being the first side to tally 50 cautions

6) Nottingham Forest’s Henri Lansbury 
tucked away two penalties in the 4-1 win over Blackburn – but wouldn’t 
have made manager Billy Davies quite so happy by picking up a booking 
for a bad foul in the second half.

It
 was his tenth of the season in just 26 games – making him along with 
Carl Dickinson of Port Vale the first to reach the mark that earns a two
 game suspension.

The
 23-year-old Lansbury, who started out at Arsenal being tipped for great
 things, will miss Forest’s FA Cup Fourth round tie at home to Preston 
plus a Championship match at Watford.

Take caution: Henri Lansbury (R) scored two penalties for Nottingham Forest against Blackburn... but also picked up his 10th booking this season

7) Mick McCarthy might be the next Championship manager looking over his shoulder as Ipswich slide into hard times.

The
 1-0 defeat at an Ian Holloway inspired Millwall was their fourth loss 
in a row, the worst sequence since just before Paul Jewell was sacked in
 October 2012.

McCarthy’s
 side, a point off the play-offs on Boxing Day after a 3-0 success at 
Doncaster, have suddenly found themselves down to tenth.

Sack race? Mick McCarthy's Ipswich lost their fourth consecutive game after defeat against Millwall

8) Kasper Schmeichel was in brilliant 
form for Leicester as their 1-0 win at Leeds put them five points clear 
at the top of the Championship.

That’s
 all the more reason to wonder why the owners at the King Power stadium 
haven’t done anything about securing the 27-year-old son of the great 
Peter on a new contract.

His
 current deal runs out in the summer, and Arsenal, Newcastle and Hull 
are among current Premier League clubs who fancy signing him on a free 
transfer.

Fumble? Leicester have not offered Kasper Schmeichel a new deal despite his heroics this season

9) Jose Mourinho finally got a striker 
scoring goals yesterday, and the Chelsea manager must have been all the 
more glad about Samuel Eto’os hat-trick after Romelu Lukaku’s on-loan 
exploits all season.

As if his performances for Everton hadn’t been embarrassment enough, he has another front man getting goals for another club.

England
 Under 21 star Patrick Bamford had already got 18 in 37 games for MK 
Dons – then he marked his first start for Derby by scoring the winner 
against Brighton.

Loan star: With 18 goals in 37 games, Patrick Bamford (C) is another Chelsea loanee doing well away from Stamford Bridge

10) Things might be tough for Sam 
Allardyce at West Ham, but just down the A12 his old number two Phil 
Brown is having a better time of it.

Brown
 can look forward seeing Hull City arrive at Roots Hall in the FA Cup 
next week in confident mood after a 3-0 win over Chesterfield, which 
took his Southend team to just one defeat in their last 15 games.

The
 man who first got City into the Premier League – and kept them there 
for a season – has moved the Shrimpers within a point of the automatic 
promotion places in League Two.
