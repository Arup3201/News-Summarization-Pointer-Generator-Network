A quarter of children in Britain are living in poverty, a controversial report by a United Nations agency claimed yesterday.

Millions ‘have fallen prey to the dangers of austerity’ during the recession years, Unicef said.

Britain was even ranked 25th on a child poverty league table of 41 developed countries – below Romania, Bulgaria and Chile.

However, critics last night described a measurement that assesses children in the UK as worse off than those in Eastern Europe as ‘worthless’.

They said Unicef was using distorted measures to paint a false picture of the real levels of poverty in Britain.

Calculations are relative to average income – so Britain appears to be worse than countries where most people are poor, because average incomes in the UK are higher.

In the latest of a succession of highly critical reports about Britain by UN agencies, Unicef said child poverty in the UK increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2008 and 2012 to 25.6 per cent.

Topping a table of countries deemed to have best protected children during the recession was Chile, where child poverty was said to have dropped by 8.6 points.

Policy: Jeffrey O'Malley is behind the report

The UN official behind the Children of the Recession report is Unicef director of policy and strategy Jeffrey O’Malley.

The Canadian has spent his career working for the UN and other global organisations.

Mr O’Malley is an active user of Twitter, which he uses to publicise not only the UN agency’s activities but his other interests, which include campaigning against climate change, and supporting the Global Drug Policy Commission, which wants to see drug abuse decriminalised.

Before joining Unicef Mr O’Malley spent 20 years working for HIV and AIDS campaign groups. For 11 years he ran the HIV/AIDS Alliance, which is claimed to be ‘the world’s largest international development non-governmental organisation specialising in HIV and AIDS’.

He then moved to the UN Development Programme, an agency which has also provoked controversy in Britain.

In 2011 it published a ‘human development index’ that put Britain in 28th place, below recession-ravaged Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland.

Mr O’Malley took over the policy role at Unicef in 2012. 

In Romania, in 12th place, child poverty fell 2.3 points, while the measure dropped by 0.6 in 20th-placed Bulgaria.

The Children of the Recession report said many affluent countries had suffered a ‘great leap backwards’ in terms of household income. Jeffrey O’Malley, Unicef’s head of global policy and strategy, added: ‘The impact on children will have long-lasting repercussions for them and their communities.

‘All countries need strong social safety nets to protect children in bad times and in good – and wealthy countries should lead by example, explicitly committing to eradicate child poverty, developing policies to offset economic downturns, and making child well-being a top priority.’

UNICEF’s use of ‘relative poverty’ in its report is unpopular in Britain.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been trying to stop Whitehall using such measurements because they are seen by many to record levels of inequality, rather than poverty.

Relative poverty counts people as poor if they live on an income below a poverty line, set at 60 per cent of median income.

But if the median income in a country rises, so do the number of people who appear to be in ‘poverty’. Conversely, if everyone is poor, but median incomes are low, it will suggest fewer people in poverty.

However, critics condemned the methods used by the UN agency to arrive at its figures.

Jill Kirby, former chief of the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, described the findings as ‘worthless’ and said Unicef should be using measures of ‘real deprivation’.

A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Unicef is using ‘out of date statistics’ and said national data showed that around 300,000 fewer children are now in poverty.

In another unflattering table of national comparisons, yesterday’s report also highlighted Britain’s ‘NEETs’ – young people who are not in employment, education or training.

Unicef found that NEETs rose from 12.1 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2012, placing the UK 14th out of 41 on the league table – below Turkey and Mexico.

‘Many will suffer the consequences for life,’ the report said.

In fact Turkey has more than doubled the percentage of NEETs aged 15 to 24 compared to Britain, and Mexico close to double.

But by looking at relative changes in the years 2008 to 2012, Unicef put both countries higher in its league table. The report said Britain should ‘review’ its economic policies as a ‘priority’ and raise working tax credit, increase benefits in line with inflation, and push up the minimum wage for under 21s.

Other UN reports have criticised Britain. Last year the UN’s special rapporteur on adequate housing, Brazilian Raquel Rolnik, angered Tory politicians when she demanded the abolition of the so-called ‘bedroom tax’.

And South African official Rashida Manjoo claimed that sexism in Britain is worse than elsewhere and that public spending cuts were making things worse.

Bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children, according to a major new report published last week.

Politicians have been reluctant to ‘call out’ bad parenting, despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling, the former Labour minister Alan Milburn said.

Mr Milburn, who was brought in by David Cameron as the Government’s social mobility Tsar, attacked MPs for being ‘tentative and timid’ about bad parenting.

Child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s, the National Children's Bureau warned last week.

It said Britain is at risk of becoming a place where 'children's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate, parallel worlds.'

It found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s. 

He called for a national parenting campaign, funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than £100,000 a year.

Mr Milburn’s report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas, action to close the gap in GCSE results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020.

It also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal, and that the ‘living wage’ should be introduced by 2025.

The recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless 'urgent action' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment.

Mr Milburn said the UK was at risk of becoming a ‘permanently divided’ nation, with the poorest in society left behind.

It says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade, amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay.
