Malcolm Shabazz, the grandson of slain civil rights activist Malcolm X, has been buried at a cemetery in suburban New York.

A spokeswoman for the family said Shabazz was laid to rest near his grandparents at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale on Tuesday.

Authorities say Shabazz was beaten to death earlier this month in a dispute over a $1,200 bar bill in Mexico City. Two waiters have been arrested in the case.

The 28-year-old Shabazz had a troubled
life, from setting a blaze in his grandmother's apartment that resulted
in the death of Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, to stints in juvenile
hall and prison.

At the time of his death, he seemed to be seeking redemption with plans to write a memoir and denouncing youth violence.

According to USA Today,
Hussein Mekki, 32, told mourners at a California memorial: 'If I could put into one word 
how I feel about Malcolm, it would be, "inspiration." Hopefully that 
will continue, and he can inspire us for the rest of our lives.'

The 28-year-old Shabazz died of blunt-force trauma injuries in hospital on Thursday. Shabazz was reportedly in Mexico to meet with labor movement organizers, Talking Points Memo said.

Juan Ruiz, part of the California-based labor group Rumec, told the website that Shabazz was in Mexico City to meet with one of Rumec's leaders, Miguel Suarez.

Mexico City prosecutors say they have arrested two men in connection with the death of Shabazz.

Manuel Alejandro Perez de Jesus, 24, and David Hernandez Cruz, 24, are employees of the bar where Shabazz reportedly got in a violent dispute last week about a $1,200 bar tab, according to an unnamed official of the city's prosecutor's office.

'He was murdered. He was in Mexico City and I believe they attempted to rob him and he didn't allow it, so they beat him to death and he died on his way to the hospital. This is all I can confirm, everything else is under investigation for the meantime,' Mr Ruiz added.

Malcolm Shabazz was the grandson of Malxolm X, the revolutionary civil rights leader. Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, so Shabazz never got to meet his famous grandfather. Shabazz was the son of Malcolm X's daughter, Qubilah Shabazz.
