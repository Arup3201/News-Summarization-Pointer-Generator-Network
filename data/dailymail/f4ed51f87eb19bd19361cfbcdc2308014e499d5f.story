A grieving Afghan mother took bloody revenge on the Taliban militants who gunned down her son, killing 25 and injuring five of them during a seven hour gun battle. 

Reza Gul watched helplessly as her son died while he manned a village checkpoint with his small team of police officers in the lawless Farah province.

But flanked by her daughter and daughter-in-law, she led a counter strike on his attackers killing 25 militants and wounding another five during a ferocious seven hour gun battle.

From left to right, Fatima, Seema and Reza Gul battled for seven hours against Taliban forces after they attacked a police checkpoint, manned by Reza's son 

'I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,' Gul told TOLO News. 'I went to the check post and began shooting back.'

Her daughter-in-law Seema added: 'The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.'

She added that the combats zone was strewn with Taliban bodies when the fighting was over.  

A spokesman for the Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior told the agency it was a symbol of a public uprising. 

The Taliban is yet to comment about the incident.

Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month. 

Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially in the country's capital Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire. 

At least 50 people were injured earlier this week, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament at an inter-district competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province. 

The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces. 

He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai.  

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered a top-to-bottom inspection of his country's military forces after a rise in Taliban attacks 

Ghani is considering whether night raids, barred by his predecessor Hamid Karzai, should be reintroduced

The latest attacks come as it was revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal.

The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed.

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years.

Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the US and NATO allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country.

The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year
