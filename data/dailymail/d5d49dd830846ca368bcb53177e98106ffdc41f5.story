The truck driver who crashed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo is fighting back against a civil lawsuit filed by the former '30 Rock' star and his friends who survived the wreck.

In new court documents filed this week, Walmart truck driver Kevin Roper requested to pause the civil suit until his criminal case for the crash is over. 

Morgan and friends were riding home from a comedy show in June when Roper struck them with his tractor-trailer on the New Jersey turnpike, killing limo passenger James McNair and leaving Morgan with a traumatic brain injury. 

A month after the crash, Morgan and the survivors  filed a civil lawsuit against Walmart, blaming the company for allowing a 'sleep-deprived' driver on the road.

In his latest letter to the court, Roper's lawyer David Glassman writes that if the civil case continues it may influence the jury's decision in his criminal case since the crash, and Morgan's slow recovery, have been widely covered in the news. Glassman even accuses Morgan and his friends of going on a 'media campaign'.

Roper is currently faced with the prospect of 30 years in jail, if he is convicted on charges of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. 

In the bitter back and fourth between both legal teams, Morgan's lawyers recently wrote that there was a 'lack of civility' in the case. 

Roper's lawyer shot back at this statement, writing that it wasn't very civil to file a lawsuit  back in July when McNair's family was still grieving.

'In fact, it would be safe to conclude that Plaintiffs' filing has established a new speed record for the tolling of the Statute of Limitations in civil actions,' Glassman wrote.

Deadly: In their civil suit, Morgan and the other survivors of the crash claim that Roper was sleep deprived when he got into the wreck 

Earlier this month, Morgan and his attorneys accused Walmart of stalling in a federal lawsuit that have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash.

Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.'

The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' 

This latest legal drama comes just a week after Morgan was seen struggling to walk on an outing to the post office with his fianceé Megan Wollover.   

The actor was leaning on a walker as he slowly moved down the sidewalk and said he was still 'fighting every day' after being involved the crash, which claimed the life of his friend James McNair and injured three others.

It was just the third time the actor has been seen in public since the horrifying car accident this past June. 

Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a broken leg, a broken nose and broken ribs in the accident.

His attorney has revealed that Morgan is still struggling to simply return 'to the way he was' after this trauma.

Last week, Morgan appeared a far cry from the extroverted and gregarious characters he has played on film and television, and was barely audible as he spoke to a nearby photographer.

At one point as he returned to his car from the post office, the actor even had to briefly stop and catch his breath before moving on.

In addition to his fianceé he was also accompanied by an aide who was there to help him get into the car.

Morgan was critically injured in early June when a Walmart tractor-trailer rammed into a limousine bus he and his friends were travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike.

The comedian, known for his roles on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock, was returning home to New York City from a show at a Delaware casino.

He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown.

'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last month.

'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.'

The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted back in October being pushed in a wheelchair.

Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident, though his new film with Chris Rock, Take Five, will be released this month.

He came out against Walmart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seatbelt.

'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time.

'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.' 

Out of work: Morgan has been unable to work since the crash, but a movie he filmed before the accident, Take Five, is set to hit theaters this week. Pictured above in a still for the film
