It was far from the nicest Saturday, weather-wise, in Manhattan today.

But Ivanka Trump was not going to let a grey sky stop her from a family outing in Central Park.

Effortlessly classy in a smock, the 32-year-old daughter of Donald Trump and her husband, real estate developer Jared Kushner, spent the afternoon strolling around the urban paradise with their two children.

The family outing came just a few days after the celebration of son Joseph's first birthday.

After a lengthy walk, they stopped by the Central Park Zoo for a look at the animals.

Attending to dad duties, Kushner was in charge of carrying the two-child stroller up the stairs.

On Tuesday the family held a party for Joseph, who was treated to a giant blue birthday cake.

The adorable tot was born in New York at 9.54pm last October 14.

The soiree was held inside the family's Manhattan apartment with friends and family.

'I can't believe how quickly 1 year has gone by. So thankful for the day Joseph came into our life. Happy 1st Birthday Joseph!' Ivanka Tweeted.

Jared Kushner, who Ivanka married in October 2009, owns The New York Observer, and is brother to Josh Kushner, who is currently dating supermodel Karlie Kloss.

Joseph's first name is that of Jared's grandfather, and his middle name is taken from Ivanka's grandfather.

Shortly after his birth, the proud new mom wrote on her Tumblr: 'Jared's grandfather, Joseph, was a rock. His indomitable spirit, his sense of family, and his work ethic are the values we hope to hand down to our son.

'My grandfather, Frederick, was a builder not just of tens of thousands of homes throughout this city, but of a tight-knit family that honors to this day the traditions he established."
