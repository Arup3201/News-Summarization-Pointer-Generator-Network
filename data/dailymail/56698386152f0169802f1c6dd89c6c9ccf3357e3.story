New York city officials declared war on rats earlier this year - and they are being helped in their quest by a group of dog enthusiasts and their four-legged friends. 

The Ryders Alley Trencher-fed Society (R.A.T.S.) is a group of owners who take their dogs out to hunt rats in New York City.

Members of the independent group venture out on night-time excursions to allow their dogs to do what they do best: hunt and kill vermin.

Experts estimate the number of rats in the city could be double that of the Big Apple’s 8.4 million people.

On their Facebook page, R.A.T.S. state that they 'came into being in 1995 at the request of a state park superintendent whose guests at the park were being besieged by scores of hungry rodents eager to share a picnic.

'He felt that dogs might succeed in holding down rat populations where traps and poison had failed.  

'The experiment was a resounding success and the loosely knit society was born.'

'It's about maintaining the breed type through actual work,' says Richard Reynolds, a New Jersey-based business analyst and longtime dog breeder who might be considered the group's organizer — if it would accept being called organized.  

The lineups included two border terriers; a wire-haired dachshund; a Jack Russell terrier/Australian cattle dog mix; a Patterdale terrier, an intense, no-nonsense breed that's uncommon in this country; and a feist, a type of dog developed in the American South to tree squirrels.

'Get 'im! Go!' Serge Lozach yells as his cairn terrier, Hudson, streaks down an alley after a fleeing rat.

Unlike many of the other owners, Lozach doesn't breed or show dogs, but he has taken Hudson to several alley hunts.

'I like watching him have fun,' says Serge Lozach who has a cairn terrier, Hudson. 

Although the dogs have hunting instincts, it takes training to capitalize on them.

Experts the number of rats in New York could be double that of the Big Apple’s 8.4 million people.

Last month New York's 45 inspectors were bolstered by nine new employees of a pilot program to tackle the vermin in chronically infested neighborhoods where rats have resisted repeated efforts to eradicate them.

Specific targets are rat reservoirs such as parks, sewers, dumping areas and subways where they congregate and breed. 

The idea is to tamp down the population where it is strongest and keep it from spreading.

'Rats burrow and live in colonies,' Health Commissioner Mary Bassett told the City Council at a hearing.

'I'll sometimes imagine when I walk through a park, if I could have sort of a 'rat vision,' there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. And from there the rats fan out.'

Financed with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels.

For years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city's 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes.

 Besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats.

New York's Rat Information Portal — or, appropriately, RIP — is an interactive online map that tracks Health Department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and ZIP code. Spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection.

The South Bronx around Yankee Stadium has the dubious distinction of being the city's most rat-infested neighborhood, according to figures from 2012, the most recent available. 

Inspectors gave a failing grade for infestation to at least 13 percent of more than 3,000 locations inspected in that area.

Washington Heights came in at 12 percent of inspected locations, West Harlem at 10 percent and the Lower East Side and adjacent Chinatown at nearly 9 percent.

Rats can carry and spread diseases, bite and trigger asthma attacks. In May, a fpur-year-old boy died after ingesting rat poison in a Bronx homeless shelter.

It's impossible to tally the exact number of rats in New York, says the Rev. Joel Grassi, a Baptist minister and professional exterminator.

'As long as there are human beings in New York City, there will be rats, because they live off human garbage — that's their No. 1 thing,' says Grassi, adding that the best way to manage the rat population is to eliminate their food supply.

Just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean it could ever catch one.

When at its best, the alley pack works together - one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking.

 Another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees. A rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it.

After making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. The night's kill ends up in a trash bin.

The Health Department declined to comment on the hunts.

The idea has a long history.

A noted 1851 examination of working-class life in London describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. 

More recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in Seattle when its owner happened by while City Councilman Tom Rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. Rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website.

There's even an American dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms.

Rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called 'barn hunt.' 

Dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry.  

While dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a New York City park surfaced online two years ago. 

PETA Spokesman Martin Mersereau calls the alley rat quests 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.'

Reynolds counters that 'there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,' noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours.

As for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. 

But Reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill.

In one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour.

The dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. #

But not to worry, said dachshund owner Trudy Kawami.

'There will always be a million rats in the naked city.'
