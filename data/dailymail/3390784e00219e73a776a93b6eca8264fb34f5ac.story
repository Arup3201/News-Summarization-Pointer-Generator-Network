Outrage has been sparked in India after men playing the roles of terrorists in security drills were dressed as Muslims and shouted pro-Islamic slogans.

A video of a drill, which was broadcast on Indian media websites, shows five policemen capturing and then pinning down three men in white knitted skullcaps before bundling them into jeeps in the Surat district of Gujarat.

The drills are being carried out across Gujarat following intelligence reports that two high-profile events - Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and the Vibrant Gujarat Investors Summit - could be a the target of terror attacks.

Speakers at the summit this month will include U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as well as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

'Mock drills were carried out in 10 to 15 locations,' Deputy Superintendent of Police, Pradeep Sejul told television network NDTV.

'This should not have happened; it was an avoidable mistake.

'We assure you that if someone deliberately made the mistake, we will take action against them.'

Kamal Faruqui of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board called the mock drill 'atrocious and highly condemnable'.

'It is profiling the Muslim community which is very bad. They should apologise, otherwise they should be taken to the court,' Faruqui told NDTV.

Police initially tried to brush off the criticism, saying the skullcaps were used 'to give them a different look', but later apologised.

Videos of two more exercises show mock terrorists shouting pro-Islamic slogans, according to NDTV.

In one filmed in the Narmada district, terrorists shout: 'Kill us if you want. Islam Zindabad (long live Islam).' 

Modi, who is leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, was chief minister of Gujarat during an outbreak of communal violence in 2002 which killed more than 1,000 people. Most of the victims were Muslims.

Concerns about religious intolerance in secular India have grown since Modi came to power in May, fuelled by reports of Muslims and Christians being forced or induced to become Hindus in mass conversions.
