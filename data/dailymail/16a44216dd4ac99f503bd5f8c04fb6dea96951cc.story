When convicted killer Michael Ibrahim got shot in the shoulder after bullets were fired at him in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD on Sunday night, it was just another chapter in his family’s colourful history.

Originally from a poor immigrant Lebanese background they are a family whose fame and notoriety precedes them in Sydney.

Before the shooting took place at around 10.30pm on Sunday night Michael Ibrahim had already been in the news.

A crime scene remained on Monday outside Michaels Ibrahim's luxury Macquarie Street home where he has lived since he left prison in August 2014

At 36 years old he is the youngest of the family and was jailed for the killing of Robin Nassour in 2006, but released on parole in August last year.

He was released after serving more than seven-and-a-half years for his role in the fatal stabbing.

At his August 2014 parole hearing Michael Ibrahim vowed to move on with his life.

He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the ‘most stringent’ parole conditions.

Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a 'wake up call', he told the parole board.

He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney. 

But he’d been trouble with the law before. In 2012 he was acquitted of conspiring to murder nightclub owner John Macris, who he believed was responsible for gunning down his brother, Fadi Ibrahim.

Fadi was lucky to survive this attempt on his life. The 40-year-old was shot five times and spent three weeks in a coma after he was ambushed by a gunman as he sat in a black Lamborghini outside his Castle Cove home in June 2009.

No one has ever been charged with the shooting.

Michael Ibrahim was sentenced to a maximum nine years and four months behind bars for his role in the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006. He was released after serving more than seven-and-a-half years

Eldest brother Sam Ibrahim is the former Parramatta chapter president of the Nomads bikie gang. The 48-year-old was shot twice in the legs in a January 2011 drive-by shooting. He has been behind bars on firearms charges since his bail was revoked in July last year.

But the most famous of the clan is John Ibrahim, 44, also known as the ‘King of the Cross’, for the number of establishments he owns in the nightclub district.

He has never been convicted of a serious offence.

However, in 2004, a police bail submission presented to court on a charge of threatening a witness described Ibrahim as ‘a major organised crime figure’ who was ‘the subject of 546 police intelligence reports in relation to his involvement in drugs, organised crime and association with outlaw motorcycle gangs’.

His life is apparently now the basis for a new $15 million TV series. 

Sisters, Armani Stelio, 39, and Jazz Dior, 43, both had run-ins with the police in recent years too.

The cause of the shooting is not yet clear and police will continue to investigate

Stellio's home in Ryde was sprayed with more than 20 bullets only a few weeks after she moved into it in November 2010. 

Six months later she was arrested along with her brother Sam, the family body guard Semi 'Tongan Sam' Ngata and a fourth person on allegations they kidnapped a man, drove him to an ANZ Bank at Ryde and ordered him to withdraw $100,000.

Police later dropped the case against all four accused.

Dior was found not guilty in December 2011 of offences relating to almost $3 million that was found in the ceiling of her South Wentworthville home in 95 vacuum-sealed plastic bags. She did not know how the money came to be there.

On Monday John Ibrahim visited his brother Michael in St Vincent’s Hospital, while detectives reportedly continued investigating whether the shooting was linked to a feud between the Ibrahims and other notorious criminal families.

Family, friends and associates flocked to the hospital during the course of Monday where Michael has been recovering since the shooting on Sunday night.

He had been sitting up in bed, was in good spirits and in a stable condition, said hospital spokesman David Faktor on Monday afternoon.

Mr Faktor said the patient had not undergone surgery.

Meanwhile, police continued their investigation at the scene of the attack on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments.

They are looking for at least two attackers and a white, possibly late model, Audi.

But whether the police make arrests or not, one thing is for certain – the folklore surrounding the Ibrahim family goes on and it's unlikely to stop here.
