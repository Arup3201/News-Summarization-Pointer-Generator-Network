Cristiano Ronaldo - the man who scored more goals than anyone in 2013 - will take on the player who scored the second most, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in Real Madrid’s first game of the year on Thursday.

Gareth Bale will not travel to Doha for the friendly to be played in the Khalifa International Stadium at 14.45 UK time but a 50,000 sell-out will get to see Ronaldo v Zlatan the rematch.

Ronaldo resumes hostilities with Ibrahimovic having got the better of him in the World Cup play-off between Portugal and Sweden in November and across the calendar month.

Cristiano Ronaldo: Games 59 Goals 69

Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Games 58 Goals 47

He scored 69 goals in 59 games in 2013 with Ibrahimovic trailing in second with 47 goals in 58 games. The meeting of two big European sides on Qatari soil might be a glimpse of the future for Premier League clubs, if they ever get the mid-winter break.

The French champions are spending a week at Doha’s Aspire Academy for winter training and for Carlo Ancelotti’s players there is also the chance to turn up the temperature.

They were put through their paces in the seven-degree cold of the Spanish capital on Tuesday in the traditional open training session in front of supporters who watched for free. But the 22-degree heat of Qatar awaits them after their seven hour flight on New Year’s day via the Dubai airline Emirates that sponsors both Real and PSG.

Bale, who sustained a calf knock in training which kept him out of Madrid’s last game of 2013, worked in the gym in the Tuesday training session and he will stay behind to focus on being fit for Monday’s first league game of the year at home to Celta Vigo.

The lucrative mid-winter friendly has been a feature of Spanish sides’ December and January programmes in recent years. Barcelona earned an estimated £3.3million for a game in Kuwait in December 2009 and this game forms part of the payment for coach Ancelotti who switched from PSG to Real Madrid in the summer.

PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investment Authority and factored two Doha friendlies into the 4m euro compensation package for Ancelotti.

The game has sold out the 50,000 capacity Khalifa International Stadium and the Qataris believe a second Madrid friendly, not necessarily against PSG, will do likewise when played either in the post-World Cup pre-season or next January.

As Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic battle to score their first goals of 2014, Bale is hoping to continue his run of nine goals and six assists in 15 matches played if he gets back on the pitch against Celta on Monday. Supporters hope his start to 2014 can be as explosive for Real Madrid as it was in 2013 for Tottenham when he scored 14 goals in the first 20 games of the year.
