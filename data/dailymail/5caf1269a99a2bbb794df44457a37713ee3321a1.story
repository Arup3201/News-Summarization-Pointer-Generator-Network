Rabbis from across Europe gathered in Prague to learn self-defence and first aid in response to a wave of attacks against Jews.

Dozens of rabbis met to learn how best to survive a knife assault and treat victims of terror attacks in the wake of growing anti-Semitism on the continent. 

Rabbi Menachem Margolin, who organised the conference, said the idea was to demonstrate 'the most basic stuff needed.'

The general director of the European Jewish Association, said a lack of action from European governments to protect Jews had led them to organise the training.

He said: 'Unfortunately, most of the Jewish institutions in Europe are not provided with appropriate security by the various governments.

'This is why we have decided to provide Rabbis and Jewish community leaders across the continent with basic knowledge and tools in order for them to be able to provide initial first aid and self-defense during a terror attack.'

Needing protection: Rabbi Menachem Margolin criticised European governments for not doing enough to ensure Jews were protected from attacks

In the last year, Jews have come under attack in Brussels, Paris and Copenhagen, sparking calls for more to be done to protect Jewish communities in Europe.

More than 1,000 people formed a 'ring of peace' last Saturday outside Oslo's main synagogue at the initiative of a group of young Muslims. 

It was a gesture intended to show brotherhood with the Jewish community in times of increasing tension between the two religions.

The training in Prague is now expected to be rolled out by rabbis in other countries throughout Europe.
