Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers who flew into Britain on the same plane as a man hospitalised with a deadly SARS-like virus.

The man, who is thought to be a US doctor or nurse, fell ill after flying from Saudi Arabia to Chicago via Heathrow.

He is believed to be the first American case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. The unnamed man is recovering in a hospital in Indiana.

Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers who flew into Britain on the same British Airways plane as a man hospitalised with a deadly SARS-like virus. Two passengers have already been tracked down

Two British passengers have already been tracked down by health chiefs over fears they could have contracted the deadly virus. 

Public
 Health England made the announcement after it emerged two passengers had
sat next to the American man, according to the Telegraph.

MERS,
 which is similar to SARS, has killed 107 people so far, with 345 confirmed cases
 worldwide. About 140 of these have been reported since the beginning of
 last month.

Professor
 Nick Phin, head of respiratory diseases for Public Health England, said
 human-to-human transmission of the virus was ‘extremely rare’.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, also known as MERS, is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

Little
 is known about the condition but it has been found in bats and camels. 
Experts believe it is most likely humans were first infected by camels.

Symptons include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is also spread among human who have close contact, experts say.

So
 far, all the cases have been linked to six countries in or near the 
Arabian Peninsula, although it has spread to around 15 countries across 
the world.

Latest 
figures from the World Health Organisation show there are at least 345 
reported cases. Of these, 107 have been killed by the condition.

But
 he told any passengers on British Airways flight 262, which left Riyadh
 on April 23, to call 111 if they experienced respiratory problems or 
felt unwell.

After arriving at Heathrow, the unnamed man transferred to a flight for Chicago, America, where he was taken to hospital three days later.

Mr Phin said the chances of passengers contracting the virus were very low, but that investigations - particularly into any passengers who continued on the second flight to America - were still continuing.

Most cases of MERS cases have been found in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries.

But, with cases emerging in Britain, Greece, France, Italy and Malaysia, there are growing concerns about the potential global spread of the disease, mainly through airline passengers.

The biggest reason for concern is that so little is known about the virus.

It has been found in bats and camels and many experts say camels are the most likely way in which humans are infected.

But the virus is also spread between humans who are in close contact with one another.

According to the World Health Organisation, 107 people have been killed by MERS since 2012, while at least 345 have been infected.

At least 140 of those cases have been reported since the 
beginning of April.

Mr Phin said: 'It's important to stress that the risk of the infection being passed to other passengers on Flight 262 is extremely low and there is no evidence from similar investigations of any evidence of person-person transmission.

'PHE
 staff have contacted - or have alerted the relevant public health 
authorities in other countries - all but one of those passengers that 
we know to have been sitting close to the case.

'We
 are also in the process of informing other passengers on the plane, who
 were not sitting in immediate proximity to the case, although all the 
evidence shows that such individuals will have been at extremely low 
risk.

Particles of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

'None
 of the passengers that have been contacted have reported any illness or
 symptoms. We would only undertake laboratory tests if a passenger had 
relevant symptoms.

'Our investigations into risks for any UK citizens on the flight from London to the US are continuing.'

Dr
 Anne 
Schuchat, director of the Center for Disease Control's national center 
for immunization and respiratory diseases, said the first American case 
of 
MERS was 'of great concern because of its virulence'.

She
 said the case represents 'a very low risk to the broader general 
public', but MERS has been shown to spread to healthcare workers and 
there are no known treatments for the virus.

There is 
now concern the disease could be spread further as millions from around 
the world start to visit Mecca and other holy sites in Saudi Arabia for 
the pilgramage season.

The main Hajj season is in October this 
year, but many Muslims also make Umrah, a less busy pilgrimage, throughout the year.

The Saudi health minister Abdullah 
al-Rabiah was sacked by the king last month after criticism the number 
of MERS cases was rising. Mr al-Rabiah was criticised for not responding
 effectively to the spread of the disease.

Egypt, from where many of the pilgrims travel, has now issued a warning against travel to Saudi Arabia.

The country's health ministry also said it was warning children under 15 and adults over 65, pregnant women and anyone suffering from chronic heart and chest diseases to postpone their pilgrimages.

MERS causes a fever and a cough, but the effect can vary dramatically, with a high mortality rate in some people, but a majority testing positive with minor symptoms or none at all.
