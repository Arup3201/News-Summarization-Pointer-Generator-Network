Google Glass may not have proved as popular as its makers would have liked, but that hasn’t stopped other firms jumping on the headset bandwagon.

Sony is the latest tech company looking to develop a Glass rival, but this time with a twist.

The Japanese firm's Single-Lens Display Module (SLDM) is a microdisplay that fits onto any type of spectacles - from sunglasses to work goggles - and can be removed when it’s not needed.

The Single-Lens Display Module (SLDM) is a microdisplay (left) that fits onto any type of spectacles - from sunglasses to work goggles - while also being detachable for when it’s not needed. Sony said that the module also has potential applications in sports (top right) or for work, to display useful information

SLDM is fitted with a high-resolution, colour microdisplay, a micro-optical unit and a miniature control board.

Sony said the board has capabilities that are ‘on par with smartphones’ to show people useful information, quickly, over their right eye.  

‘This display module possesses the potential to enrich users' lives in a variety of ways,' said the firm in a press release. 

‘By simply attaching it to a pair of glasses, goggles, sunglasses, or other type of eyewear, you can instantly gain access to visual information that adds a level of convenience to your everyday life.’

Sony continued that the module also has potential applications in sports or for work, to display useful information.

The ‘sub-window’ connects to the frames of existing glasses and has been designed not to obstruct the wearer’s field of vision.

And, because it is detachable, it can be removed when it’s not needed.

Sony said it is hoping to start selling the module ‘within the coming year’, but will be unveiling a concept model at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Vegas in January.

It is also looking to partner with eyewear manufacturers, sports and entertainment brands, and other electronic experts to make the device more widely available.

Sony will also make the software development kits (SDK) available for developers to create apps, when the module is nearer to completion.

This display module’s microdisplay measures 0.23-inches, with a resolution of 640 x 400 pixels. 

The display unit weighs around 40g - 22g for the display arm and 18g for the secondary arm.

By comparison, Google Glass weighs 43g, and its display has a resolution of 640 × 360 pixels.

Sony’s SLDM is fitted with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, as well as an electronic compass, accelerometer and touch sensor.

It is powered by an ARM Cortex-A7 Processor. 

There is no mention of an on-board camera on Sony's headset, which would put it at a disadvantage to Google’s model, fitted with a 5MP camera.

‘Many situations spring to mind in which hands-free display of information would be extremely beneficial,’ explained the firm.

Sony said it is hoping to start selling the module (example uses are pictured) ‘within the coming year’ and will unveil a concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas in January. Sony will also make the software development kits (SDK) available for developers to create apps, when the module is nearer to completion

The display has a resolution of 640x400 pixels and weighs 40g - 22g for the display arm and 18g for the secondary arm. By comparison, Google Glass (pictured) weighs 43g, with a 640x360 pixel resolution. There is no mention of a camera on Sony's module, which would put it at a disadvantage to Google

‘For example, when cycling, playing a round of golf, or [taking part] in some other outdoor sport, attaching this module to a pair of sports sunglasses and pairing it with a smartphone would enable you to access valuable information such as course maps or distance readings, even when your hands are tied.

‘Alternatively, the module could be paired directly with an action camera capable of remote display on a smartphone, enabling you to check the angle of view and the captured image from a distance through your eyewear. ‘

‘As a final example, Sony has high expectations for the module's applications in a work setting, such as when linked to a factory's internal infrastructure system. Instructions could be given remotely and hands-free, allowing workers to continue their work uninterrupted.’
