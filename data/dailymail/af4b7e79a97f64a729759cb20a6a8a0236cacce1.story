A construction worker was killed by a 'piece of flying machinery' just weeks after dodging death in a similar incident, it has been revealed.

Ben Wylie, 24, from Westbury in Wiltshire, was killed after being struck in the head by an object while laying foundations for a new office block in Maidenhead, Berkshire last Tuesday.

Just six weeks earlier Mr Wylie had posed for photographs with the mangled wreckage of crane that was crushed by a digger only minutes before he planned to move into the area.

Mr Wylie was killed after being struck in the head by a piece of flying machinery that had broken off, according to witnesses.

Despite emergency services being called to the scene and an air ambulance landing nearby, he was declared dead at the scene.

Forensic examiners later attended the site, where Mr Wylie’s body was seen lying next to a 30 foot tall piling drill 
with blood covering his head.

One builder working at the site, who asked not to be 
identified, said: 'A piece of machinery has flown off and hit him. 
Police are investigating it.'

Following the fatal accident, Mr Wylie’s girlfriend, Chrissie Harland, said that she had been left devastated by the tragedy.

'The
 guy in this picture is the love of my life and always will be, he 
wasn’t only my boyfriend he was my bestfriend, my soul mate! People say 
we made such a beautiful couple and I agree, the moment I seen him he 
caught my eye,' she told friends.

An inquest was today opened into Mr Wylie’s death. A
 date had not yet been set for the full hearing of the inquest where a 
coroner would hear the full facts behind what had occurred.

Just six 
weeks before the fatal accident, Mr Wylie told friends he had cheated 
death when he dodged a potentially lethal accident by two minutes.

He had been working on a building site when a digger driver reversed into a small crane, crushing its platform.

Mr Wylie told friends he would have been between the two vehicles and crushed if the collision had happened two minutes later.

Posing for photographs with the twisted metal, Mr Wylie said: 'So, I may be smiling here but if it would have happens to minutes later then I probably wouldn’t of been smiling [sic]'.

A spokesman for the building firm, McAleer and Rushed said: 'We are all in shock at the moment. We will be releasing a statement in due course.'

A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said: 'HSE has been informed and is making initial enquiries. An inspector will be on site later this afternoon. We will be working alongside Thames Valley Police, who have primacy.'

The inquest continues.
