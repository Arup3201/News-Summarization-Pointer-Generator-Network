Nina Khosla, 26, is the daughter of billionaire Silicon Valley power couple Vinod and Neeru Khosla

The ex-boyfriend of the daughter of a prominent Indian-American family was arrested last week after it emerged that he had allegedly attempted to blackmail her family using nude photos of his ex.

Nina Khosla, 26, is the daughter of billionaire Silicon Valley power couple Vinod and Neeru Khosla.

Vinod, 59, is the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems who now runs his own venture capitalist firm, while wife Neeru, 59, is the co-founder and chair of the non-profit CK12 Foundation.

The alleged blackmailer is Douglas Tarlow, who Nina met while studying product design at Stamford University in 2007.

FBI
 agents last week arrested Tarlow, 27, in connection with the alleged 
extortion plot. He is scheduled to appear before a U.S. District Court 
preliminary hearing on Thursday.

The pair were a couple for about two years before breaking up in late-2010. During
 their relationship Khosla ‘voluntarily took nude photos and video’ 
which she shared with Tarlow, according to detailed in a court affidavit
 sworn by Agent Glenn Solomon-Hill.

Although the FBI affidavit does not name Tarlow’s alleged targets, The Smoking Gun has reported that the Khoslas are the victims referred to in the document.

‘I’d prefer that you didn’t write about that,’ Nina Khosla told TSG.

Tarlow is alleged to have threatened to distribute the naked images online, warning in one e-mail that, ‘Everything is going to reddit. From there, it will be impossible to remove from the internet forever.’

In a text message to Nina Khosla’s mother - who was sent several of the nude photos - Tarlow stated, ‘it seems you’re going to be the mother of the next Paris Hilton,’ investigators allege.

Not long after the couple’s relationship ended, Khosla recommended Tarlow for a $125,000 job with her mom’s education foundation.

But relations soured just seven months later when Tarlow was fired in February 2012. 

In the months that followed he sent text and e-mail messages to Neeru Khosla complaining that he had been treated unfairly, and that she ‘owed him money from his tenure at the company,’ according to the FBI affidavit.

In September 2012, mother and daughter both received texts from Tarlow’s phone number featuring several of the naked photos. One text to Nina asked, ‘shall I call you Paris?’

Tarlow also claimed that he was owed $72,000 for his work at the education foundation.

In an October 2012 e-mail to Tarlow’s Gmail account, Nina Khosla asked why he was threatening her.

A reply e-mail claimed, ‘not me. No idea what that is.’ A second e-mail stated, ‘please don’t contact me further.’

In
 late-2012, the Khosla family contacted the FBI who used grand jury 
subpoenas to link Tarlow to threatening texts and e-mails sent to the 
two women - but he was not arrested at that time.

More
 than a year then passed before Tarlow allegedly re-contacted the 
Khoslas last December, once again threatened to release the naked 
photos.
