These two police officers were obviously taking frontline policing very seriously as they were caught by a Google Street View car carrying out investigations crammed into a phonebox.

The Northamptonshire Police officers were captured on camera examining a red phone box in the upper-class village of Nether Heyford, in Northamptonshire

Whatever crime they were investigating was clearly worth the attention as both officers stand inside the box while closely looking at the phone on the receiver.

'Ello 'ello 'ello: The two police officers were captured cramming into the phonebox by the Google Street View camera

Inquiry: The two officers can be seen to squeeze into the phonebox in the sleepy village of Nether Heyford

But their hard work and diligence is clearly being rewarded - the village is one of the most crime free areas in the country and did not record a single incident for the entire month of November.

One local said:'Perhaps the coppers were so desperate for something to do they made a 999 call themselves to boost their numbers.

'It is unfortunate both officers were pictured crammed into the tiny phone box.'

Hardly a hotspot for crime, the village is better known as having one of the largest village greens in the country.

It is also the site of two Roman villas.

In the years since the Google Street View fleet began trawling more than five million miles across the planet they have collected a range of bizarre and unexpected images, including a tiger walking across a car park and a range of fancy dress costumes in bizarre situations.

Job well done: The village is one of the most crime-free in the country and did not record a single incident in November
