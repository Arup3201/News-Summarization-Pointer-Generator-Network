A former policeman revealed today that shamed DJ Jimmy Savile was notorious among officers - but no one dared challenge him because he was so well connected.

Paul Leonard, 68, said he once approached the celebrity's Rolls-Royce at 11.45pm when it was stopped in a lay-by in Leeds and caught him with a young girl.

But Savile made it clear to the officer that he was to be left alone with the teenager.

'I'm waiting for midnight when she turns 16... so p*** off if you want to keep your job,' Savile told the officer, according to the Daily Mirror.

Mr Leonard - who had his name changed by the newspaper - reported the incident to his Sergeant but was told that the television star had 'friends in high places' and was ordered to drop it.

Disgraced: Savile, who died aged 84, was notorious with the police in Leeds who were powerless to stop him because 'he was well-connected'

The officer said it was well known among police in Leeds that Savile 'liked them young'.

The chilling incident happened in 1965, when Savile was a well-known DJ locally in Leeds, but it was before he found fame on Radio 1.

In the decades after the missed chance to stop him, the paedophile star went on to abuse hundreds of young people across the country.

Mr Leonard said when he spotted the car parked in a secluded lay-by near Roundhay Golf Club, Leeds he thought it was stolen.

The officer - who was patrolling on a Noddy bike - said that the young girl in the car with Savile looked like she was aged around 15.

Mr Leonard said he asked the girl if she was OK and she smiled back at him. He added that Savile was very calm despite being caught with such a young girl.

'He wasn't angry. it was more like bragging. I was only young and worried about keeping my job so I left them,' he added.

'Looking back I feel bad about it, but he had so much influence. I would definitely have lost my job.'

Mr Leonard said that the DJ, who was 
never exposed as a sexual predator in his lifetime, had police officers 
in Leeds in the 'palm of his hand'.

The former officer stayed with the police force for three more years until 1968 when he moved on.

Mr Leonard's claims provide fresh evidence that police covered up Savile's abuse for decades.

The Radio 1 DJ is thought to have raped 
34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 people, including 
some as young as eight, according to an official report. He died two 
years ago, aged 84.

Yesterday it was revealed that a 
former police inspector ‘acted on behalf’ of Jimmy Savile before his 
controversial interview over sex assaults of teenage girls.

A West Yorkshire-based officer is alleged to have contacted Surrey Police before its detectives interviewed Savile in 2009.

Transcripts
 of the interviews – released by the force this week – provoked anger as
 they appeared to show detectives adopting a kid-glove approach to the 
DJ and paedophile who was being accused of sexually assaulted girls at a
 school in Staines during the 1970s.

Abuser: DJ Jimmy Saville was interviewed by detectives in 2009 - but a chance to catch him was missed

The disgraced broadcaster told detectives that he had been targeted with false claims by blackmailers, and said: ‘I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons who come to see me socially, but I give them all my weirdo letters.’

The informal meetings between Savile and police at his flat in Leeds were known as the ‘Friday Morning Club’.

During the remarkable interview, the disgraced DJ accused his victims of trying to blackmail him and said 'normally you can brush them away like midges'.

He told police: 'We showbiz people get accused of just about everything. One of the reasons is people are looking for money, and they will try blackmail, and they will write letters, saying if you don’t send us money, I will say you’ve done this and you’ve done that.

'That’s why I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons, who come to see me socially,  I give them all my weirdo letters, and they take them back to the station.

'You would be amazed at the depth that they go to. Wearing my Broadmoor hat, I don’t find it amazing at all, because wearing the Broadmoor hat, people do strange things. The strangest of strange things.'

It has emerged that the interview took place months after the West Yorkshire inspector first contacted Surrey Police over their plans to quiz Savile about the ‘historic’ sex allegations.

The officer told Surrey Police that he knew the DJ ‘personally’ and allegedly brokered the interview with Savile.

Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that a preliminary probe had been launched into the claims but this would now become a full investigation.

Victim: Jill Bartlett fell pregnant after being raped by Jimmy Savile when she was 16. She criticised the police's questioning techniques

In the interview, lasting just 56 minutes, Savile denied claims he forced one girl to touch his groin, made another perform a sex act and stuck his tongue down a young girl’s throat.

He claimed that the women were looking to make money out of the allegations, which were put to him during an interview in his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on October 1, 2009.

It was not clear last night whether the officer, who has since left West Yorkshire Police, was among those officers who attended Savile’s ‘Friday Morning Club’.

Victims of Savile and child protection campaigners called for an independent inquiry into the police dealings with the Top of the Pops star.

This is a transcript of the interview conducted by Surrey Police with Savile in October 2009. It was released earlier this year by the force following a Freedom of Information request

Last night, Jill Bartlett, who was raped by Savile, falling pregnant at the age of 16, said there should be an inquiry.

She said: ‘Jimmy Savile was very persuasive, but police should have training so they’re not fooled. All kinds of criminals and psychopaths are persuasive and the police should be above that.

‘I think there should be a full inquiry into their dealings with him. He was known as someone who liked young women, and the police should have known about it and acted.’

Caroline Moore, who was 13 and recovering from an operation on a children’s ward at the hospital when Savile stuck his tongue down her throat, called for an inquiry into the police.

The 54-year-old, who is disabled and from Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, said: ‘There should be a proper investigation into all the social meetings Savile said he had with police. Not an internal police investigation, because no one really has faith in them any more.’

Sylvia Edwards was 19 when she was groped by Savile after he put his hand up her skirt during a live broadcast of Top of the Pops in 1976. Cameras caught her shrieking and moving away from him.

Yesterday, she said: ‘I honestly think the police should be held accountable. There should be an inquiry and people should be made to stand up. The (police officers) should be named.’

Asked whether Surrey Police missed an opportunity to prosecute Savile while he was still alive, she said: ‘I don’t think they missed it, I think they deliberately ignored it because of who he was.’

Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas, a former Surrey Police detective, said: ‘It’s clear that over a period of time complaints were made about Savile and information was held about him and I think it’s fair to say West Yorkshire Police’s report was a whitewash. It was very poor.’

Operation Newgreen, a West Yorkshire Police report published this year, found no evidence that Savile was shielded from arrest and protected from prosecution by his relationship with the force.

A spokesman for the IPCC said: ‘The Commission has begun an independent investigation in relation to the alleged actions of a former inspector with West Yorkshire Police.

'The allegations refer to the officer having “acted on behalf” of Jimmy Savile by inappropriately contacting Surrey Police ahead of a police interview.’
