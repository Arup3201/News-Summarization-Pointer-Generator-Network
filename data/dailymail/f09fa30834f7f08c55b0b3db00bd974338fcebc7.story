Derry Mathews will challenge world lightweight champion Richar Abril in Liverpool on March 6.

Abril, who holds the WBA title, was due to face Anthony Crolla later this month but the Manchester fighter was attacked just before Christmas after interrupting a robbery.

As a result, Mathews, who beat Crolla in 2012, will step in for his first shot at a world title against the tricky Cuban.

The 31-year-old from Liverpool is a former British and Commonwealth champion and has won four of his last five fights but will start as the underdog against Abril.

The champion fought just once in both 2013, when he won the title against Sharif Bogere, and last year when he won a majority decision against Edis Tatli in Finland.

His sole outing in 2012 saw him lose a split decision to Brandon Rios.

A source confirmed to Sportsmail that an official announcement will be made this week.

Mathews will be joined on the card at the Echo Arena by Paul Butler who will attempt to win his second world title.

Butler takes on IBF super-featherweight champion Zolani Tete in what will be the South African’s first defence.

Butler, 26, previously moved up to bantamweight to take on then world champion Stuart Hall, winning by split decision in Newcastle.

‘It’s going to be a magical night at the Echo Arena with my fans backing me all the way to a second world title,’ he said. 

‘It’s by no means going to be an easy night against Tete, who’s a very tough and experienced champion, but fighting for the world title in front of my fans at home means the world to me and that will give me the extra determination to win it.’
