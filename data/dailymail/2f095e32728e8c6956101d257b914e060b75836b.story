Taxi apps such as Hailo and Uber are used to ‘e-hail’ a taxi every two seconds.

And as these apps become smarter, experts predict they will sync with social networks and calendars to provide an even more efficient and tailored service to their passengers.

TVs in the back of cabs could automatically change channel based on a user’s likes of dislikes, for example, or drivers could anticipate when and where a passenger will need a ride – even before the customer does.

Taxi apps including San-Francisco based Hailo, Uber and Maaxi have created a culture of e-hailing and as these apps become smarter, they will sync with others to learn about passengers. For example, TV channels in the back of cars could broadcast favourite shows based on Facebook Likes, or could track a user’s schedule

The predictions were made in Hailo’s Future of Cities report, unveiled at an event in London alongside a range of new features.

‘In the next few years, the apps we use will begin to understand what we are doing and become more contextual,’ explained the report. 

‘For Hailo, the app will know when you are leaving a client meeting and send a taxi to meet you.’

The report claims that the technology people carry with them is giving more control over what they do; allowing taxi apps to adapt the city to their needs, rather than the other way around

It was written by leading futurologists, Mark Brill and Ian Pearson.

‘Apps are already familiar, but the internet of things will integrate them, letting people interact with their surroundings much better,' said Mr Pearson.

Earlier this week, designers at Washington-based iStrategyLabs unveiled their Dorothy prototype, that uses heel clicks to order a taxi.

Dorothy is powered by the LightBlue Bean - an Arduino micro-controller inside a Ruby insert - and features an accelerometer, and a cell battery.

The Ruby clips onto any shoe and connects wirelessly to the Dorothy app and a ‘trigger’ is activated using three clicks of the heel - and these triggers can be customised.

The prototype version’s triggers include receiving a call, sending a template text to three friends or ordering an Uber taxi.

When the onboard accelerometer detects clicks, it sends a signal to the connected phone via Bluetooth. 

He added that such apps may evolve to accommodate gestures such as snapping fingers, or using spoken commands to order taxis automatically.

And as wearables increase in popularity, waving a hand to hail a cab will easily be detected by an electronic ring or wristband.

Elsewhere in the Future of Cities report, so-called ‘digital bubbles’ will make it easier for taxi app users to find dates by highlighting strangers with compatible profiles and diary availability.

And, with a list of customer preferences sent during the booking procedure, drivers could advise their passengers where to visit, adding a personal touch, especially for tourists.

Within the next five years, as self-driving technologies become more mainstream, the futurologists predict that many cars will converge with the high street.

In addition to carrying passengers, self-driving cars, such as Google's prototype and Mercedes' Future Truck 2025, as well as traditional taxis, may also become delivery drivers.

This means people could order a taxi to collect dry cleaning, for example, or deliver medicine using a single app.

Uber announced earlier this week that it was partnering Vaccine Finder.

The service delivers a registered nurse and a vaccine kit for up to 10 people, when ordered through the Uber app.

The service is free, but is currently limited to Boston, New York and Washington between set times. It is part of the pilot launch of the UberHealth program.

Uber has previously used this so-called, ‘on-demand model’ to deliver ice creams, and Valentine’s Day gifts.

Mark Brill predicts that taxi apps and services will use such models to become more tailored to the passenger’s needs.

‘By combining big data with algorithms and statistical analysis, we can create a more intelligent service,' he wrote.

‘By mapping the movements of people from their mobile devices, it is possible to predict a need in advance of the event itself.

‘Imagine, in the future, your Hailo cab is on its way to you before you even know you need it.’

He continued that through the use of personal data, taxis will be able to deliver a unique service.

This graphic reveals key figures in the first three years of Hailo. The app launched in two new UK cities, Liverpool and Leeds, this week, and is now available in Singapore. People hailing taxis on the street can now pay for them using their Hailo app - even if the cab isn't managed by Hailo

‘As you step into the cab, [drivers] will have an idea of your likes, dislikes and interests.’ Taken from apps such as Facebook or Twitter.

‘The in-cab media will be showing you a relevant TV channel. Or maybe you want to work, in which case you’ll be offered a quiet, undisturbed journey?

‘Alternatively, perhaps you are planning to catch-up your favourite team’s game on TV when you get home? The driver will know you don’t want to hear the score.’

The experts also predict that owning a car will be a thing of the past as taxi apps expand to more regions and become alternatives to owning vehicles, especially in busy cities.

People hailing taxis on the street can now pay for them using their Hailo app - even if the cab isn't managed by Hailo, too.  

Uber also launched a new service called Uber XL, which lets users book a ride with seating for up to six people in London and up to eight in Manchester.
