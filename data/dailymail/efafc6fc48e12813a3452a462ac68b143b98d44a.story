Actor Stephen Collins has asked a judge to eliminate any future spousal support payments over leaked audio in which the former 7th Heaven star purportedly acknowledged molesting underage girls.

Collins' attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan filed a trial brief on Friday stating that his client has lost all future earning power due to the posting of the audio online last month.

His estranged wife Faye Grant has denied that she leaked the recording made during a 2012 therapy session.

A trial on how to divide the pair's assets is scheduled to begin on Wednesday.

The recording cost the 67-year-old Collins a role in the upcoming film Ted 2 and knocked scheduled re-runs of 7th Heaven off two cable networks.

Collins was due to be paid $75,000 for the Ted 2 role, according to the filing.

‘Spousal support should be zero, as a result of the unlawful recording that was disseminated to the media,’ Kaplan's brief states.

Collins has not commented on the audio.

Collins and Grant were married in 1985 and the actor filed for divorce in 2012.

The actor had agreed to pay Grant $13,000 a month in spousal support, although the trial will focus on how to divide assets accumulated during the marriage.

Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, with appearances in movies such as All the President's Men, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and recurring roles on TV series after 7th Heaven concluded its 11-season run in 2007.

Few Hollywood divorces in recent memory have been as ugly as the Collins case. 

The actor filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year.

Grant has said she gave police the audio of a 2012 couple counseling session in which Collins admitted to molesting young girls. 

She said she did so only after he refused to seek appropriate treatment. But Grant has denied giving the recording to TMZ.

California's ‘no fault’ divorce laws generally make the cause of a breakup irrelevant in court, and divorcing couples who don't have an agreement on how to split assets acquired during marriage are generally required to divide them evenly. 

Collins' divorce case will focus on how to divide property and earnings with Grant.

Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture

At issue in the trial is a pair of properties in the posh Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and whether Grant should receive more than $13,000 a month in spousal support. 

Grant's attorneys wrote in court filings that Collins is expected to have more than $5 million in assets once the case is resolved.

‘I am seeking no more than that to which I am legally entitled under the laws of the State of California,’ Grant wrote in a recent statement. 

She added the audio has not been part of the divorce proceedings.

Beyond the divorce case, the Collins audio has raised a number of ethical and legal issues about how it was recorded, and what it now means that the revelations apparently made in the privacy of a therapy session have been made public.

‘Clients knowing what they're saying in a therapeutic setting is confidential is hugely important,’ said Stephen Behnke, the director of the American Psychological Association Ethics Office.

The ethical standard is for psychologists to obtain permission from patients before they record them, he said. 

There are legitimate reasons why a therapy session might be recorded, such as reminding a patient what is said during the treatment, Behnke said.

He noted that while psychologists are bound to strict guidelines about disclosing details divulged in treatment sessions, other people in the room are not.

‘I think that there's an understanding that therapists control his or her office,’ said Benjamin Fenton, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in medical privacy cases. 

However, Fenton said it would be difficult to hold the therapist accountable for a recording made in secret.

‘It would be hard for him or her to be liable to the husband,’ Fenton said.

Surreptitious recordings aren't uncommon in divorces and other situations where one person is trying to get the upper hand in a case, said Douglas Mirell, a Los Angeles-based media lawyer of the firm Harder Mirell & Abrams.

‘People do record each other with some alarming degree of frequency in hopes that they can use it for what some might characterize as extortionate purposes,’ Mirell said.
