A man who was trapped for six days in a truck after it crashed in southern Colorado spoke about how his friend, the dead driver, helped him survive.

Richard Koester was in the passenger seat when Ronald Lee Mohr suffered a sudden diabetic coma and lost control of the vehicle near Canon City, Colorado on October 11.  Mr Koester says the truck flew through the median onto the other the side of the road and off a 30 foot cliff into a ravine 

Mohr died on impact while Mr Koester survived. But the crash crumpled the truck's cab, pinning Mr Koester inside so he was unable to escape.

Lost and found: Richard Koester was stuck in a crashed car for six days last October. After being rescued, both of his legs had to be amputated

He says he wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for his dead friend's body keeping him warm.

'I was laying on top of him the whole six days and nights. I had no idea he was with me when I woke up,' Koester told ABC News.  'That and a couple of other things kept me alive. He kept me a little warmer for a few extra days.'

When he came to after the crash, the last thing Mr Koester remembered was calling his daughter to wish her happy birthday.

Mr Koester tried to move but to no avail.

'I stuck my arm out the big hole in the back of the truck and was yelling for help,' he said.

For the next six days, Mr Koester was wedged in the cab without food or water.

But he wasn't forgotten. The two were 
reported missing when they didn't return from a trip to Cripple Creek, a
historic Rocky Mountain mining town now popular for its casinos.

'We knew he was missing because he left his dog behind,' his mother Barbara Dial told Today. 'He never leaves his dog anywhere.'

Mr Koester's sister Michaelle Wollery drove up and down dirt roads, looking for a sign of her missing brother.

He was finally located six days later on October 17, by a transportation worker who spotted the truck when looking down a guardrail.

'They were found and one person had severe injuries and I knew that was my son,' Ms Dial said. 'I'm always going to celebrate that day as a second birthday.' 

Though he had to have both legs amputated after his rescue, Mr Koester says he appreciates life more now after his brush with death.

'There's just so many ways I should have been dead,' he said.
