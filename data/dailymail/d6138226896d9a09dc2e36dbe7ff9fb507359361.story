Shay Given has been recalled to the Republic of Ireland squad ahead of next week's double-header against Oman and Georgia.

The 38-year-old Aston Villa coach, who announced his retirement from international football after the Euro 2012 finals, is a surprise inclusion in Martin O'Neill's final 27-man party for next Wednesday's friendly against Oman in Dublin and the opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Tbilisi four days later.

Skipper Robbie Keane is being monitored as he attempts to shake off a minor problem, although O'Neill is hopeful he will be fit for the Georgia game.
