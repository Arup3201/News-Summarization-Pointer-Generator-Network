Defending the Union: Ed Miliband accused Jeremy Clarkson and the Scottish National Party of holding 'deeply pessimistic' of national identity

The majority of English and Welsh people want to save the Union and prevent Scotland becoming independent, it was revealed today.

Only one in three asked by pollsters said they would be happy if their northern neighbours left the United Kingdom. 

The new survey by The Independent asked whether Scotland should be separate and independent, and two out of three said no.

Its result flies in the face of claims that most English and Welsh would be happy not to 'subsidise' Scotland, as some critics have claimed happens.

ComRes said when asked if they agreed Scotland should be separate from the rest of the UK and become independent, 28 per cent agreed, 57 per cent disagreed and 15 per cent didn't know.

And only one in five pensioners wanted Scotland to gain independence.

It came as Labour leader Ed Miliband launched an attack on Jeremy Clarkson and Scottish nationalists in a speech hailing patriotism and defending the Union.

Mr Miliband criticised the Top Gear presenter for ‘shrugging his shoulders’ at the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK.

He accused the likes of Mr Clarkson and the Scottish National Party of holding ‘deeply pessimistic’ and ‘narrow’ views of national identity and warn that it is a ‘false choice’ to ask people whether they want to be Scottish or British in the referendum that is expected in 2014.

Mr Clarkson used his newspaper column in January to proclaim: ‘If the Scottish people want to break away, then I shall stand on Hadrian’s Wall with a teary handkerchief, and say, “Good riddance to the lot of you, and take your stupid bagpipes with you”.’

Controversial: Top gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson used his newspaper column in January to declare how he would say 'good riddance' to Scottish people if they chose to break away from the Union

In a speech at the Royal Festival Hall in London, the Labour leader warned against a retreat into narrow nationalism within the United Kingdom and call for a  progressive patriotism which embraces the mixed identities of modern Britons.

He said: ‘The nationalists of the SNP pose a false choice. They ask: are you Scottish or British?  I say you can be both. And here in England there are people like  Jeremy Clarkson who shrug their shoulders at the prospect of the break-up of the Union.

‘It’s a mistake wherever you find it. Having to say Scottish or British, Welsh or British, English or British. I don’t accept any of that. It’s always a false choice.

'We in the Labour Party have been too reluctant to talk about England in recent years, as if somehow talking about England is a threat to the United Kingdom.

'Somehow, while there has been a lot of romanticism on the left about Scottish identity and Welsh identity, English identity has just tended to be a completely closed book, something that people have shied away from.

'Why is that? I think it's partly 
because people have been nervous that it undermines the union, but also 
because it was connected for some people with the kind of nationalism 
that left people ill at ease.'

Winning: Ed Miliband said England's run at Euro '96 had helped reclaim a sense of national identity

He
said the Union Flag had been reclaimed from the National Front and the 
Euro 96 football tournament reclaimed the English flag.

But there was still 'nervousness' and polling showed some people still associated the Cross of St George with racism.

'That's not my view, I think we should be proud of the flag of St George, I think we should applaud people who fly it.'

He urged the Scots to back the England football team yesterday - and then said he wouldn't mind if Scotsmen backed France instead.

The Labour leader risked ridicule over mixed messages as he made a speech on national identity.

Mr Miliband said the England football team would need all the help it can get at the European Championships which begins on FridayI.

But his attempt to keep everyone happy only risked offending everyone.

In answer to a question about whether Scots should support England, he added: 'England needs as many supporters as it can get in these championships but I don't think it makes them un-British if they don't support it. That's what's important about national identity.'

In a message to First Minister Alex Salmond, he said: 'Economic progress is not going to be achieved through Scotland leaving the United Kingdom and simply being part of Europe.

'It's going to be achieved with Scotland part of the United Kingdom. Our identities, our economies, are too intertwined to believe anything else.

'Change will come when the United Kingdom works together, not pulls apart.'

Admitting that his party has been ‘ill at ease’ discussing nationalism in recent years, Mr Miliband said: ‘For too long people have believed that to express English identity is to undermine the Union. At the same time we have helped express Scottish identity within the Union.

‘This does not make sense. You can be proudly Scottish and British. And you can be proudly English and British, as I am.’
