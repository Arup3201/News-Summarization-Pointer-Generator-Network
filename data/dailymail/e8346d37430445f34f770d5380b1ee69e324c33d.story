Jailed: David Seal, 78, told officials that his father, who would have been 104 this year, was ill or abroad before pocketing his pension every week

An elderly man cheated the state out of over £90,000 after claiming his dead father's pension for 21 years.

David Seal, 78, told officials that his father, who would have been 104 this year, was ill or abroad before pocketing his pension every week.

Yesterday he was jailed for 12 months after he admitted theft and dishonestly taking £90,580.

Divorcee Seal began claiming his father's weekly pension after his death in 1989 aged 83, using the old-style cash books.

The Daily Mirror reported that he then opened an account in his father’s 
name in 1995 when the system changed so that payments went straight

The newspaper reported that Kevin 
Slack, prosecuting, said: 'The court might be astonished that he was 
able to perpetrate this fraud for so long,

'When
officials asked for a contact address Seal said he did not have one but
that his father was due very shortly to go visiting friends in 
Australia and would then be moving on to Canada.'

Fraud: Sentencing Seal at Liverpool crown court, Judge Robert Warnock said if he was younger he would have been sentenced to a longer jail term for fraudulently claiming his dead father's pension

The court heard that Seal evaded
the Department of Work and Pensions until officials suspended the 
payments and visited his flat in New Brighton, Wirral, in April.

Sentencing
him at Liverpool crown court, Judge Robert Warnock told Seal that if he
was younger he would have been sentenced to a longer jail term.

But he said he reduced the sentence as an act of mercy.
