An airport has apologised after it posted on its Facebook page a light-hearted comment with a photo of a plane crash in which a child died.

Luton Airport published the image of the plane crash with a joke boasting about its own safety record.

‘Because we are such a super airport....this is what we prevent you from when it snows......Weeeee :),’ the Facebook status accompanying the photo read.

The picture showed a crash that killed a
 six-year-old boy in Chicago after a Boeing 737 slid off the end of the 
runway in heavy snow and hit the car he was travelling in.

Upset: Luton Airport has said sorry over this post on its Facebook page of a 2005 crash in Chicago that claimed the life of a six-year-old boy, Joshua Woods

Shocking: The Boeing 737 crash eight years ago was huge news but the 'over-enthusiastic' worker at Luton had little idea of its significance

Incident The plane slid off the runway and collided with cars, killing Joshua and injuring nine others

Joshua Woods died and nine others were injured as their vehicles were also smashed into. Three passengers 
from the plane were taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Tragedy: Six-year-old Joshua Woods was killed when the Boeing 737 slipped off the runway and hit the car he was travelling in

The photo and comment were immediately criticised by sickened Facebook users before the image was removed over an hour later.

Yesterday the airport apologised ‘unreservedly’ as it blamed the stunt on an ‘over-enthusiastic’ member of staff.

It was posted at 9:15am on Wednesday and removed at 10:30am after an outcry from Facebook users.

Kelly Garrett posted: ‘I am pretty appalled that this is your official page and that this is the image and wording that you use.

‘This is so inappropriate and should be removed immediately, it is certainly not something that should be taken so lightly and made fun of.'

Another Facebook user, James Clarke, added: ‘Poor form really, as a child died in this incident.’

The image was posted after much of the UK was hit with snow and is thought to have been intended to illustrate how good the airport is at clearing snow from the runway.

The picture showed the incident when a Southwest Airlines slid off the runway. The flight from Washington was landing in Chicago in a snowstorm on December 8 2005 when it crashed and hit several cars.

The snowstorm had reduced visibility to less than one mile and there was eight inches of snow on the ground in the area.

Messages: Dozens took to the page to criticise the message blamed on a over-enthusiastic member of staff

Statement: Airport bosses then took to the site last night to apologise to anyone offended by what happened

A spokesman for Luton Airport yesterday said: ‘London Luton Airport apologises unreservedly for the post on Facebook, which was wholly unacceptable and insensitive.

‘We have Social Media guidelines that clearly outline what is acceptable, however in this instance a new, over-enthusiastic member of our support team made an honest but misguided mistake and clearly stepped over the line.

‘We apologise for any offence caused. Further steps have been taken to guarantee this never happens again.’
