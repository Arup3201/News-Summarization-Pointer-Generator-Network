It’s one of the most technologically advanced devices ever built and will give cosmologists incredible insights into the origins of the universe.

Nasa's James Webb 
Telescope, if it’s a success, will herald a new era in the understanding
of the universe, because it will be able to look further back in time, 
and with more clarity, than any telescope that exists today.

Nasa
boasts that the telescope is 100 times more powerful that the Hubble, a
device that has already given star-gazers thousands of stunning images 
of the cosmos.

But the project has a dark side - it is costing the U.S. 
space agency so much money that it is acting like a financial black 
hole, sucking funds away from other projects and threatening their 
future.

The telescope began as a $500million project in the late 1990s, but that cost has now ballooned to over $8.8billion.

Last
year Congress tried to permanently halt the project. It’s all systems 
go at the moment, but it’s such a drain on Nasa’s budget that the agency
may only be able to afford one big science mission per decade from now 
on, with some key projects killed off.

For example, House Science Committee staff warn that a mission to bring Martian soil back to Earth may now be too expensive to carry out.

Not only that, but Webb will sit much further out into space.

Hubble is in orbit 350 miles above the Earth. Webb will gaze into the cosmos almost a million miles from Earth.

The area of Webb’s mirror, meanwhile, is six and a quarter times larger than Hubble’s. The larger primary mirror the more light from objects the telescope can see.

It will also have new communications networks to transmit and store large quantities of data and ultra-sensitive infrared detectors to record extremely faint signals.

All this means Webb will see objects that are
fainter and farther away and allow scientists to peer back to a time 
when galaxies were just forming.

The Webb Telescope is due to launch in 2018, with various components currently undergoing rigorous testing.
