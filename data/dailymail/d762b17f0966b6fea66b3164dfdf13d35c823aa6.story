Sydney Swans veteran  Adam Goodes has revealed that he is considering entering politics when he playing days with Australian Football are over.

The Australian of the Year recipient has been vocal in the past about his desire to be remembered as more than a football player, and to use his career in AFL as a way to create history on and off the field.

'I don’t simply want to be remembered for just kicking around a footy. I want to be remembered for making a difference,' Goodes said.

The premiership-winning captain, who is an anti-racism activist, said that a career in politics after he retires from AFL is an option.

'I wouldn’t say yes or no to politics but it is a real option. It allows you to do something positive for a large amount of people,' Goodes said.

Goodes said that he was passionate about addressing issues such as domestic violence, and throwing his energy into campaigns such as Say No to Racism, and the Recognise campaign to include indigenous Australians in the constitution.

He said that he knew politicians in sympathy with the causes would be needed to make a real impact.  

Goodes, an ambassador for Indigenous Australians, said that a decade ago he had suffered mental health issues in the past which had made him passionate about seeing others reach out for help. 

'Only about 10 years ago I fell in a pretty dark hole. I was pretty upset. I didn’t want to be in Sydney any more and I had to go and see someone – I was constantly down. I had to ask for help because I didn’t know how to help myself,' he told news.com.au.

Speaking about the high pressure environment of football, Goodes said that the spotlight was always on during game time, which made reaching out even more vital. 

At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year.

He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year.

'Very proud' Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes said his indigenous heritage is a very important part of his life.

On receiving his award he said he was a 'very proud indigenous man' who was keen to fight racism in Australia.

He said it was a different accolade altogether to the one's he was used to receiving in AFL.

'I’m a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s not like winning a premiership or winning a Brownlow medal for the skills that you show on the football field, it’s quite amazing.' 

Earlier in the year during an interview with the BBC, the AFL star said some Australian policies had resulted in the suppression of indigenous people and other minorities and called for better education about the country's history.

'The history of our country is built on so much lies and racial policies, and things that have suppressed my people and lots of minorities in this country, so you can't blame people for having the views that they have,' he said.

He also said children needed to be taught that Australia wasn't founded by Captain James Cook.  

'I can use my position to help educate people to see through the things that they've been taught growing up,' he said. 

Goodes stepped up his work as an anti-racism campaigner last year after being subjected to abuse by a 13-year-old girl during a Sydney Swans game, and later became the subject of a joke made by Collingwood President Eddie McGuire in relation to King Kong the musical.  

On Shane Warne and the controversial Twitter admission he made during an AFL match where the leg spinner said he was 'shocked' he won the Australian Of The Year honour, Goodes said:

'My argument has always been, 'I didn't nominate me...I don't have a vote on the Australia Day council, it's their choice.' 

Former test Cricketer Adam Gilchrist who is a member of the Australian Day council said Shane Warne is entitled to his opinion on both the AFL player and the Australian of The Year winner, but stopped at saying Warne was 'racist'.

'Some have misconstrued Warnie's comments as racist. People have got wildly out of control if they think that.'
