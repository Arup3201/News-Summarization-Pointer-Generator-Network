Christmas shopping in central London in mid December is not for the faint-hearted. 

Wind, rain, angry customers, queues and general confusion are just a few of the issues that shoppers have to deal with when trying to find the perfect present in one of the capital's department stores. 

But the biggest retailers do have their perks - one of the main ones being the beautiful window displays they build every year.

Harrods, Selfridges and Hamleys are among the London stores with festive windows. They outdo each other with outlandish decorations, including real trees, VIP penguins and life-sized Santas - like this one in the Hamleys shopfront.

From Selfridges and Harvey Nichols to Harrods and Fenwick, the outside of every building is decorated with festive themes in a competition to create the biggest wow factor.  

This year, Father Christmas, multiple penguins, the ballet and even the iconic London black taxi have all featured in the festive scenes.

The golden goose at Selfridges took so long to create that the designer managed to work her way through ten audio books while building it. 

The store's creative director Linda Hewson told MailOnline last month that a lot of planing goes into the window displays: 

She said: 'We take inspiration from all over the place. It can be from festivals or fashion shows and we just begin collecting ideas together before deciding on a final theme.

'You do have to take a risk when anticipating trends so far ahead and it does require a lot of foresight.'
