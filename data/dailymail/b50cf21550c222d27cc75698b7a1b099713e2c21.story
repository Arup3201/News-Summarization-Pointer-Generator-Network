Lara Stone and her gap-toothed grin burst onto the fashion scene in 2006 when she was dubbed an 'alternative' model for her imperfect teeth and curvacious figure.

And now the Dutch model's money-making mouth makes its return in Stella McCartney's latest fragrance campaign.

The 30-year-old appears in a shoot and video for the signature STELLA fragrance, which combines notes of rose, amber and peony, and was originally launched in 2003.

During the video a completely naked Lara bites on a STELLA perfume bottle made of ice, with the camera focusing on her prominent gap.

The campaign posters are equally risque with the dark purple bottle protruding from Lara's dewy lips and her gleaming white teeth resting on top of the perfume.

The Dutch model is in high demand at the moment, having recently landed a campaign with Calvin Klein and appeared in a shoot for Net-a-Porter's The Edit.

Designer Stella McCartney claims she could see no other model fit to represent her signature fragrance: 'STELLA is a celebration of women, and 
Lara is the perfect representation.

'She brings the ideas of the 
fragrance alive, in an honest way, she is a modern woman who is 
approachable and sensual at the same time', says the 42-year-old.

STELLA was originally launched back in 2003 and was the designer's debut fragrance. It was inspired by the notion of the English rose and took influence from Stella's country home.

Signature scent: The designer says that the fragrance, that originally launched in 2003,Â  is so true to the brand that it didn't need updating

The original scent remains unchanged but the perfume bottle has been updated and now comes with a gold collar and the outer carton is covered in cute gold polka dots.

Stella added: 'When we created STELLA, we created a scent so true to the brand, it was an effortless extension of the Stella McCartney brand and still stands for today'

The new-look packaging for STELLA will be previewed in Harrods throughout July and will be available nationwide from 1st August.
