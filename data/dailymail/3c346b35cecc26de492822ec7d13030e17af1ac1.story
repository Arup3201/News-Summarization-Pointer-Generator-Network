Siberian villagers were left stunned when a flood washed what appears to be a piece of inter-continental ballistic missile onto their doorsteps.

The fibreglass cylinder floated into the garden of a traffic policeman after floodwaters inundated the village of Malougrenyevo in Altai, Western Siberia.

After villagers took photos and circulated them online, speculation grew that the tube could be part of a spaceship fallen to Earth, or even an ICBM that had been decomissioned and buried nearby.

Surprise: The cylinder which washed up in a Siberian village, panicking locals who feared it might be radioactive

As fears began to mount that it might be radioactive, a general consensus emerged that it must be dangerous and that authorities would move quickly to hush up the blunder.

But RT, the Russia's state-backed international news network, reported that the truth was somewhat more mundane.

It quoted Alexei Yaskin, professor of aero-space engineering at Biisk Technology University, as saying the cylinder was indeed probably a relic of Russia's space industry, albeit one that never made it off the planet.

'That this is an empty body of a rocket engine, presumably left from the Soviet times on the territory of the Biysk chemical plant,' he said.

'As it's an empty body with no fuel in it, it poses neither public nor technical danger.

'Such tanks may be handy in households as water collecting and storage containers, or - if dug into the ground - can be used as a sewerage facility.'

His explanation was backed by a local 
government official, who said that a family living close to 
Malougrenyevo had had been using it to store water.

The
 chemical plant in Biysk, Altai's second largest city, had previously 
used such tanks as containers for rocket fuel, RT reported.

After demand
 dropped with the fall of the Soviet Union, there were plenty of tanks 
left spare.

Officials say it is a relic of the space industry, but was left spare when local enterprises shut down in the 1990s

Nikolay Dochilov, deputy chief of the Federal Scientific and Manufacturing Centre in Altai told Itar-Tass the rocket part was made of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer.

He said: 'It is a legacy of of an enterprise closed at the beginning of the 1990s that specialised in filling the shells with fuel.

'We did had an enterprise that specialised in filling those missiles, which were produced at Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine. The rockets were decommissioned in 1992-93 and then scrapped. Several of the shells were left, but since they were never filled with fuel they were safe and people took them home.

'We sent a member of staff to go and double check that there is no danger, and he confirmed that this is just an empty shell that has never been filled with fuel and therefore is not dangerous. Nor is there any issue of secrecy here.'

Tatyana Zhdanova, whose family owns the tube, told Sibnet.ru that they had bought the tube from the plant. She said it got away during the flood.

'It broke the fence and floated away with the dogs, who were hiding inside,' she said, adding that now it has become famous they may now auction it off.
