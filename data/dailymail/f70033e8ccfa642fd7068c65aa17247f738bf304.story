With his familiar blue polo shirts in the summer and drab jumpers in the winter, David Cameron is often criticised for his dull dress sense.

His brother-in-law Robert Sheffield, however, is less conservative.

I hear that Rob co-hosted a cross-dressing party last week with rock star Bryan Ferry’s son Otis.

True blue: David Cameron's brother-in-law Robert Sheffield (right, pictured with a friend) wore a blue wig and glittery mini-dress for a cross-dressing party

Guests at fashionable nightclub 
Loulou’s in Mayfair included Prince Harry’s best friend and ‘wingman’ 
Tom Inskip, Made in Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli and former Tory 
MP Derek Conway’s flamboyant son Henry.

‘First,
 Rob wore a blue wig and a glittery mini-dress that was very Cher, circa
 1967,’ Henry, a stylist, tells me. 

‘Later, he changed into a  showgirl 
outfit cut off at the middle that showed off his midriff. He  looked 
fabulous.’

Ferry’s 
girlfriend, Burberry model Edie Campbell, wore a moustache and mutton 
chops with her velvet suit and military-style headgear.

Viscountess Weymouth, the new 
daughter-in-law of the eccentric Marquess of Bath, wore a black suit 
without a shirt, showing off her lace bra. She posed with Mark-Francis, 
who sported a blue Marie-Antoinette-style dress with a pearl necklace.

‘The Brits love to dress up, particularly
 the smart set,’ says Henry, who paid homage to Mary Berry in a 
salmon-pink Chanel twinset and pearls, topped with a blonde wig and 
floral headband.

‘This was a really extreme example of that. Dressing up encourages people to let loose, really.

‘What
 was so funny was that there were seven or eight photographers outside 
and they didn’t recognise anybody,’ he adds. ‘I just waltzed in.’  

Rob,
 who works for auctioneers Christie’s, is the only son of Old Etonian 
landowner Sir Reginald Sheffield and the half-brother of the Prime 
Minister’s wife Samantha.

He stands to inherit an estimated £20 million fortune and a 3,000-acre estate as well as his father’s title.

After fathering Samantha, 42, and Vogue deputy editor Emily Sheffield, 40, with former ‘It girl’ Annabel Jones, now Lady Astor, Sir Reggie went on to have Rob, Alice, 33, and Lucy, 32, with his second wife, Victoria.

In 2011, it was reported that Rob, who is unmarried, was courting former Miss Northern Ireland Joanne Salley, who was embroiled in a topless photo scandal while teaching art at Harrow school.

Two years earlier, he was said to be stepping out with Sophia Hesketh, the daughter of former Tory Party treasurer Lord Hesketh.

Mr Cameron, who did not attend the party, liked to dress up when he was a member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford, but has the Prime Minister ever worn drag?
