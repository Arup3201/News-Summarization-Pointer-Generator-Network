Hillary Clinton's once-stratospheric presidential poll numbers have begun their inevitable slide down to earth, and the leader of the 'Ready for Hillary' draft movement conceded Thursday that she's not as inspiring a candidate as President Barack Obama once was.

Former Obama 2012 Battleground States Director Mitch Stewart hinted Thursday that he'll have trouble getting as excited about a Hillary 2016 effort.

'Well, you fall in love once, right?' he said Thursday in a videotaped interview. '2008 was a magical time.'

But Hillary now has Democrats' 'best shot at winning,' he added during his interview with Politico, so the Ready for Hillary PAC's infrastructure – and, presumably, its millions of dollars – would be transferable to whoever wins the nomination.

Stewart still refers to a Hillary run for the White House as a 'potential' campaign, even though his group has raised more than $6 million from 55,000-plus contributors since its January 2013 launch.

There has been no public discussion about whether the donors would feel baited-and-switched if their campaign cash ended up supporting Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or any of the other Democratic hopefuls who have tested the waters in public or behind the scenes with fundraisers.

'I'm not in love, no no,' a mocking Tim Miller, executive director of the right-leaning America Rising PAC, taunted Stewart on Thursday.\

'"I'm supporting her just because" isn't exactly an inspiring campaign anthem.'

'Her strategists' quote encapsulates a summer where the promise of Hillary's campaign has been met with the cold, hard reality of what is sure to be a dreary slog to 2016,' Miller said.

His quick-punching message group ridiculed Democrats on its website after Stewart's remarks hit the Internet, saying that while their 2008 slogans were 'Change You Can Believe In' and 'Yes We Can,' the 2016 equivalent would be 'Meh, I guess she’s our best shot.'

Clinton's sense of inevitability has taken a tumble since she claimed, while promoting her slow-selling memoir, that she and former President Bill Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001.

Pundits contrasted that claim with the Clintons' wealth, massive speaking fees and high-flying lifestyle, turning an offhand comment into a national gaffe story.

The perception that the former Secretary of State is tone-deaf has taken its toll.

A McClachy-Marist poll released on Thursday shows her once robust edge against likely Republican front-runners is thinning.

Against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, she had a 55-39 lead in April polling, a margin of 16 points. That has shrunk just seven at 48-41.

The 21-point chasm between Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, measured in February, is now just 6 points, a 47-41 edge that shows how soft her support has become.

For the first time, in fact, Clinton fails to crack the 50 per cent threshold in hypothetical contests against any Republican challenger.

Her 'misstatements, starting with "we left the White House broke," aren't headline grabbers, but they're noticeable,' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York.

'With Hillary Clinton, there's no preseason,' he added. 'She needs a Super Bowl-like performance from start to finish.'

No one in the GOP has emerged as a pack-leader. The Marist poll shows Bush and Christie tied at the top of a 10-person field with 13 per cent support. 

The 'undecided' category still beats all comers, with 24 per cent.
