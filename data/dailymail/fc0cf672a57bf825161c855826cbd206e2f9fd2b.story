Cristiano Ronaldo looked like he was preparing for life in Brazil as he dazzled his Portugal team-mates in training with a samba dance.

The Real Madrid superstar is known for bamboozling defenders with a quick shimmy of his hips and he put those skills to good use by dancing around the ball as team-mate Hugo Almeida ran in to tackle him.

Pepe, Ronaldo's pal at Madrid and the national side, looked very impressed and began to do his own samba wiggle in response. But the Portugal hatchetman displayed a little less grace than the Ballon d'Or winner.

Ronaldo gave Portugal a boost on the eve of the World Cup by resuming training ahead of Tuesday's friendly against the Republic of Ireland at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 

The 29-year-old Real forward has been struggling with tendinosis in his knee and a muscle injury in his left thigh since the end of the domestic campaign and there were serious fears he may miss Portugal’s opening game of the World Cup against Germany on June 16.

However, the Portuguese Football Association confirmed encouraging news on Saturday, nine days before the country's opener in Salvador.

Ronaldo inspired Madrid to their 10th Champions League title - La Decima - last season and has now spoken of his desire to add the World Cup to his huge trophy haul.

But Portugal are far from favourites for the World Cup – they have been drawn in a tricky group alongside Germany, Ghana and the United States, so reaching the knockout stages will be far from easy.
