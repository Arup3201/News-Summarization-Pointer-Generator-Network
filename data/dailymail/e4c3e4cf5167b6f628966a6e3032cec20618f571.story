Taylor Armstrong did not contact police over alleged abuse 'to protect daughter'

In the days leading up to his death, friends family of Russell Armstrong have revealed he was deeply concerned about how he was being portrayed on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

And now scathing comments about show bosses Armstrong made in one of the last interviews conducted have emerged.

'Everything you see on that show is bull****,' he said. 'Those Bravo b*****ds take every little argument out of context and magnify it for the cameras.'

'Evil': In one of the last interviews conducted before his death, Russell Armstrong called TV network Bravo 'bastards' for their portrayal of him on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills

Speaking exclusivity to TheFix.com, Armstrong added: 'The Russell you see on TV has nothing to do with my real personality.

'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords. That's not me you see up there. It's just a character I play on TV.'

Last week Armstrong's 69-year-old mother John Ann Hotchkiss threatened the network with legal action if they proceed with plans to air footage of her son.

She told Headline News: 'Before the new 
season even started, before he took his life, he said, "Mom, they’re 
just going to crucify me this season".'

'That's not me': Armstrong said of his onscreen portrayal, 'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords'

'He said, "I don’t know what to do. I’ll never survive it".'

She has also said that the TV network: 'Better not air one frame of my son... or else!'

During his TheFix.com interview, the businessman appeared to change his tune at one point. 'At first I was a little annoyed about all the bull****, but then I realised it's not so bad to be a celebrity,' he said. 'The thing is, all the publicity has been great for my business.'

Armstrong's statement is contrary to the widespread reports that he was in hot water financially at the time of his death.

In the interview Russell also appeared to deny the highly-publicised rift with his wife Taylor, whom he was estranged from.

'She is the most sensitive, sweet woman I've ever met. Taylor's kind of like an angel,' he told TheFix.com. 'She really is everything to me.

'We watch these stories about our terrible marriage, and we lie in bed and laugh. The truth is we are really, really happy.'

Representatives for Bravo are yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment on Armstrong's claims.

Armstrong was found dead last Monday after hanging himself at a home he was staying at on Mulholland Drive.

Mail Online revealed on Saturday that John Ann Hotchkiss will not be attending the planned memorial service for her son in LA this Wednesday  after tension with Taylor Armstrong boiled over.

Instead she will remember her son at a 
separate memorial service, which is due to be held next week as well, in
 either Evergreen or Benton, Texas, just outside of Houston.

Meanwhile, sources close to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast have claimed that Taylor failed to go to the police over her husband's alleged abuse because she wanted to protect their daughter Kennedy.

'She said that she didn't want Kennedy to know and she knew that Russell would never harm their daughter,' the source told Radar Online. 

'Kennedy would hear them yelling behind closed doors but she didn't witness any violence.'
