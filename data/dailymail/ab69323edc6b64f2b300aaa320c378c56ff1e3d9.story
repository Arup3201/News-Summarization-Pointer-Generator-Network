The artists behind the First World War poppy memorial in London are in line for gongs in the Queen's new years honours list, it has been revealed.

Paul Cummins and Tom Piper have been nominated by ministers for their work in creating Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London, it has been reported.

The pair are most likely to be appointed OBEs for services to the arts after nearly five million people flocked to view the stunning exhibit in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday.

It is understood that the award was approved by the arts and media honours committee, the Sunday Times reports.

The newspaper quotes a senior Whitehall source as saying: ' They have both been recommended for honours. It will happen in the new year list.'

The ceramic flowers were designed by Mr Cummins, who revealed how the project was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town.

Tom Piper, a theatrical designer with the Royal Shakespeare Company, helped devise the exhibit and was instrumental in creating two of its key elements, the Weeping Willow - a cascade of poppies which spills from a window of the castle - and the Wave - which swirls out of the moat to form an arch over the entrance to the Tower. 

The artwork, marking the centenary of the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, captured the public imagination and was visited by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh (pictured)

 The team began producing the flowers - each of which took three days to make - at an 8,000ft factory in Derby in January

Theses two features will remain at the Tower until later this month and will then go on tour around the country until 2018, when they will be gifted to the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester.

An army of volunteers has already begun removing the poppies after what was a once-in-a-lifetime installation.

Previously, Mr Cummins has said: ‘I read through wills of First World War soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed. He wrote of “blood swept lands and seas of red, where angels dare to tread”. It read like a poem and it just seemed to fit.’

The artist, who is studying for a PhD at Derby University, added: ‘This is the biggest thing I have done. I am amazed that people have taken it to heart.’
