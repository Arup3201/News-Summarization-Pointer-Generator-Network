Roberto Martinez is excited about the prospect of leading Everton into European football, and believes he has a strong enough squad to compete in several competitions.

Everton take on Wolfsburg at Goodison Park on Thursday night in their first European tie since December 2009, when they lost 1-0 to BATE Borisov.

And Martinez believes that his club should be trying to win the competition and moving forward to compete in Europe on a regular basis.

Roberto Martinez insists that his squad is large enough to cope with playing multiple games every week

'It is an exciting game for us. Coming back to European competition is what we want and what we worked extremely hard for last season. Everyone is excited at Goodison,' the Spanish manager told talkSPORT.

'It is 52 years the first time we were involved in European competition so that shows you the history and how important it is for Everton be in European competitions again, and we are looking forward to it.

Martinez also insisted that his squad can handle the rigours of playing twice a week, claiming that academy products can make the step up into the first team. 

The international experience of players like Leighton Baines will help Everton according to Roberto Martinez

The last time Everton played in European football was against BATE Borisov in 2009 at Goodison Park

Everton's last European adventure was under David Moyes and with Tim Cahill a key player 

'We have seven games in three weeks but the squad is big enough. The academy and the younger players we produce at the club are ready to help the team. It is something that we embrace. 

'It's not an excuse to have seven games in such a short period of time. What we want is to be as good as we can, every time we're on the pitch and the more competitions we can be involved in, the better.'
