Romelu Lukaku is on the verge of completing a £25million move from Chelsea to Everton.

The striker had been expected to join up with Jose Mourinho's side on Wednesday afternoon but he is now flying to England from Belgium to seal a five-year, £75,000-a-week deal with the Toffees.

On Wednesday Lukaku posted a picture of himself on Twitter seated on a jet, giving a thumbs-up and broad smile, along with the caption: 'Time to write a new chapter.'

True Blue: Belgium centre forward Lukaku spent last season on loan at Everton from Chelsea

Not wanted: Lukaku has spent the last two seasons out on loan after joining Chelsea in 2011

The 21-year-old enjoyed a successful loan spell at Goodison Park last season, scoring 15 Premier League goals in 31 appearances after joining the club on transfer deadline day.

His future has been the subject of intense speculation over the summer, with Atletico Madrid and Wolfsburg among the clubs interested in his services.

But Everton boss Roberto Martinez has convinced the in-demand forward that his future lies on Merseyside as he bids to improve upon last season's fifth-placed finish.

Lukaku's goals proved vital as Everton mounted an impressive assault on the league's top four, only to see their challenge for a Champions League spot come to a disappointing end in the closing weeks of the campaign.

He will eligible to face Mourinho's men on August 30 when Everton host Chelsea at Goodison.

Speaking to talkSPORT about a deal for Lukaku last week, Martinez said: 'Rom fits in really, really well at Goodison.

'We created a fantastic bond with the player, and the player with the fans, and that is something that we would love to extend.'

Martinez's backroom staff had been instructed to devise a fitness programme tailored to Lukaku's needs as he recovers from Belgium's run to the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil. Training kit had already been assigned for him too.

Lukaku's agent, Christophe Hentoray, also represents Everton target David Henen. The 18-year-old Anderlecht forward has been training with the club and could complete his move soon.

The Toffees' other Belgian, Kevin Mirallas, is due to return to the club on August 7
