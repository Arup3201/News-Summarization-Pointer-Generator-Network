Engelbert Humperdinck screams 'pop legend' before he even opens his mouth. For starters, there are the sideburns.

Huge things that stretch from his temples to his jowls and are coloured, like his hair, the deepest auburn. The dye job, he says, is the only thing 'I've ever had done'.

He looks, well... how best to describe this showbiz demigod who's sold more than 150 million albums, had a gazillion knickers hurled at him by besotted fans and turned 78 yesterday?

Engelbert has returned to the music scene once more with a new album called Engelbert Calling

With his fluffed-up mane, honey tan and huge frame, I think leonine best sums him up. And, boy, has he enjoyed the odd night on the prowl in his time.

'I've had more paternity suits than casual suits,' he says matter-of-factly. There are claims he's slept with 3,000 women.

He says the number is lower, but I don't think he was really keeping score. The only woman who's ever truly mattered is his wife Patricia, to whom he's been married for 50 years.

'My wife's a wonderful lady,' he says. 'She's put up with a lot but she's very intelligent and knew deep down that, whatever I did, it wasn't serious. She knew I always loved her more.

'But I think being in showbusiness and having so many people giving themselves, I suppose I thought I was missing something. It was a part of growing up. I think my wife got hurt a lot,' he admits. 'I've tried to make it up to her. I ring her three or four times a day - not because of guilt but because I want to talk. I'd like her to travel with me more but she's not been well.'

Enge, as he asks me to call him ('that's Enge as in Stonehenge'), looks genuinely sad when he says this.

His voice - which is part Las Vegas where he spent a chunk of his 47-year career after finding humungous fame with Release Me in 1967, and part Leicestershire where he grew up and still has a huge 25-acre estate complete with its own pub - wobbles.

Enge adores his family, which includes six sisters, two brothers and four grown-up children of his own. One of the hardest-working men in showbusiness, he clocked up 65,000 miles on the road in the first three months of this year.

I meet Enge before he appears on BBC2's Later… With Jools Holland. He's as jumpy as a frog in a blender. 'This show tonight is scaring me,' he says.

'I can go in front of thousands of people on stage and not be afraid, but when there's just a few people, that scares me.'

Enge is one of the least showbizzy showbusiness legends on the planet. So much so, you'd struggle to find anyone with a bad word to say about him – apart, perhaps, from his old mate Tom Jones.

The two men, who used to be very close, fell out following the death of their former manager, Gordon Mills, from cancer 27 years ago.

The pop legends were both discovered by Mills in the mid-60s and became partners in the then huge MAM record label, until Enge decided to branch out on his own. 'We haven't spoken since we lost our manager,' he says.

'Tom never forgave me for not staying with Gordon, but I wanted to go off on my own because Gordon was partial to him. So I haven't spoken to him for 27 years. I tried to make friends with him again but he just pooh-poohed it. I tried to say, "Let bygones be bygones," but he didn't want to know. He and his son (Tom's manager Mark) were as cold as ice, but I don't mind the fact we don't speak. It's his loss.'

'Tom never forgave me so I haven't spoken to him for 27 years. I tried to make 
friends with him again but he just pooh-poohed it'

Indeed – Enge isn't short of friends. Take the playlist of his new album of duets: Elton John, Cliff Richard, Johnny Mathis, Lulu, Charles Aznavour, Neil Sedaka, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick… it goes on and on. 'It was listening to Elton John's live album that gave us the idea.' 'Us' is he and his son Scott, now also his manager.

'Elton introduces a song saying, "I wrote this many years ago when I was a struggling songwriter waiting for an Engelbert Humperdinck to come along and take a song like this." So, we called him, asked him to do a duet on the album and he said yes. I was so thrilled.

'When he came to LA to record, we sat and talked for over an hour getting acquainted then he said, "Come on. Let's do it." He's so professional and courteous. Afterwards he sent me the biggest bunch of flowers you've ever seen.'

He duets with Lulu on I Need You Now. 'She's been a part of my success - which is why I wanted to share this album with her,' he says.

Lulu, it turns out, voted Release Me a hit on Juke Box Jury back in 1967. 'All the others voted it a miss,' says Enge. 

Engelbert received a shocking defeat at the Eurovision song contest in 2012  when he represented Britain

This album, he says, has been a 'two-year labour of love' following his shocking defeat at the Eurovision Song Contest in which he came second to last after singing Love Will Set You Free.

It was, as he says, 'all political'. 'When you're drawn to sing first, as I was, you're forgotten by the time the whole thing goes through. All I can tell you is it was political and it was disgusting.' Does he regret appearing? 'I thought it was a great honour to represent my country and I had a great song. The mere fact I lost was no reflection on me.'

He's had more gold and platinum discs in his career than most of us have had hot dinners. But it wasn't until he was 30 that he got his 'lucky break' with Release Me, when he got a chance to perform the song, which had been released on 13 January, 1967, in a show at the London Palladium, replacing singer Dickie Valentine who'd fallen ill.

'The record didn't move for three months,' he says, 'until I got a shot at the Palladium. The very next day it started selling 80,000 a day, 90,000 and then it went to 127,000 a day.'

He went to the States and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show.

He says Ed 'promoted you in such a way you can't not be successful. Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Moody Blues – they all went on his show and became huge stars. Suddenly I was appearing with people I'd heard singing as a little boy, like Bing Crosby.

Engelbert describes Elivis Presley as his 'twin'

'I remember him standing in front of me, rehearsing with his pipe in his mouth – this legend, looking at me. When I finished he took his pipe out and said, "That's some set of pipes you've got there, boy."'

Enge sparkles when he says this, much as he does when he speaks about his old muckers Dean Martin ('he always called me Humpy Bumpy Lumpy Dumpy. I loved him very much').

Frank Sinatra ('he bought Strangers In The Night off my manager. I'd already recorded it but it didn't belong to me any more. I heard he paid a lot of money for it. I knew Frank very well but I didn't like his ethics – stealing my song') and Elvis Presley ('I saw him three months prior to his death and knew he was troubled, but he was such a big star I felt inadequate to give him advice as a friend. I could see the grey in his face and I could see he was losing it. I later heard he used to speak of me as the twin brother he lost at birth. I thought that was quite a statement.')

Back in the days before plain Arnold Dorsey had changed his name to the rather preposterous- sounding Engelbert Humperdinck, Enge was can't-afford-a-packet-of-peanuts-let-alone-a-pint poor.

'I used to walk past the pub and smell the beer instead of walking in and being able to buy half a pint,' he says.

'Those were hard years. There was a lot of starvation. I went three or four days without food.' Now he can eat what he wants, with a fortune of over £65 million having invested wisely in 'bricks and mortar for my children'.

But he's never stopped working for it. 'Sometimes now I'll be about to go on stage and there's 10,000 people out there and I'll say to myself, "God, I don't feel like it tonight." Then they call your name, you walk out and you just come to life. My job is to entertain people and make them happy. I'm blessed to be able to do that.'

He could, he says, 'keep chatting for hours' but he must prepare himself for the Jools Holland show, which he decides to do at the bar with a big glass of wine. Like I say, Engelbert Humperdinck ('I like the name Engelbert. It's unusual,' he says. 'But Humperdinck? Not so much') is a 24-carat pop legend.
