Online poster: Leader Ray Nottage went onto a newspaper to praise Christchurch Council and slam those who disagreed with its policies

A town hall chief has been unmasked as
the mystery author of internet postings stating his own council was ‘doing a
great and excellent job.’

Ray
Nottage, the Tory leader of Christchurch Borough Council in Dorset, 
logged on to the message board of his local newspaper under the 
anonymous username of ‘doomdodger’.

Mr
Nottage went on to praise the council he ran and 
slam people who criticised some of its decisions.

He wrote: 'Where on earth does all this doom and despondency (sic) come from?

'Christchurch is a great place, the council is doing a great job in a great community.'

Singling
out a fellow poster, named as ‘Victor’, who had been critical of Cllr 
Nottage in the past, he said: 'Has this Victor ever done anything that 
benefits Christchurch or is he just another failed moaner intent on 
causing trouble.

'Your 
interest is not to see the borough prosper but to attack officers and 
members doing an excellent job at CBC.'

When confronted with the fact that he was ‘doomdodger’, Mr Nottage, 71, said he had done nothing wrong.

'I was using the system as it is set up on your website, the same way as everyone else has,' he said.

'I was responding to an extraordinary cynical view online about the working of the council.

'It
is supposed to be anonymous and if someone is allowed to say the chief 
executive (of the council) doesn’t care for Christchurch under 
anonymity, I should be allowed the same rights.'

Praise: Ray Nottage, under the anonymous username of 'doomdodger', said 'Christchurch is a great place, the council (pictured) is doing a great job in a great community.'

A rival councillor slammed Mr Nottage for hiding behind the cloak of anonymity.

Fred
Neale, an Independent member of the council, said: 'I would have 
thought he would have no qualms about posting comments about the 
council’s work in his own name.

'I would have thought that he would not want to hide behind anonymous comments.'

Mr Nottage is not the first local councillor to be caught out praising his own work using an anonymous name.

Ben Grower, a Labour councillor on neighbouring Bournemouth Council, used the local newspaper website to big himself up.

He wrote: 'the area does have councillors who care...well done Ben Grower.'

After
admitting the poster was him, he said:'I have done nothing against the 
law and probably next time I will just use a different pseudonym.'
