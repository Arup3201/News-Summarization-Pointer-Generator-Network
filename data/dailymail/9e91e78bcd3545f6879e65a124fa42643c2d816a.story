Big-hitting Australian cricketer Mitchell Johnson was at his destructive best in Zimbabwe when he smashed the glass of the Harare Sports Club commentary box with a damaging six.

Johnson, 32, timed the shot to absolute perfection when he belted it back over the head of  Zimbabwean seamer Tinashe Panyangara and straight towards commentators Neil Manthorp and Pommie Mbangwa.

Mbangwa, a former Zimbabwean paceman, was left to pick the flying shrapnel out of the inside of his shirt during the second last over of Australia's record breaking innings.

The shot caught commentator Manthorp completely off-guard and with little idea of how fast the ball was traveling.

'Beautifully struck', he said, before reacting on impact. 'Oh, it's hit the commentary box window and there's glass all over the place.'

Johnson's display of power hitting was replicated right throughout the Australian batting line-up which belted a first innings total of 6-350 - enough to crush Zimbabwe by 198 runs in their one-day international fixture.

The all-rounder was one of a number of Australian batsmen clubbing sixes across the park including Glenn Maxwell 92 and Mitchell Marsh who hit 83.

Mbangwa, who was too busy shaking shards of glass out of his shirt, later joked about Johnson's damaging shot - tweeting to his followers that he had chicken and glass shards for lunch.

'Well, that was an interesting last 10 overs. Braaied chicken and glass shards for lunch. Thanks Mitchell.'

An apologetic Johnson later tweeted back: 'Didn't mean to give you guys a scare up there in the Com box @SuperSportTV Need Chris Gayles arms to get it higher!!'

Johnson was referencing the damaging West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle, who two years smashed the same pane of glass.

He said he had an inkling the ball was headed for the commentary box from the moment it left the bat.

Mitchell Johnson's tweet following the match Australia won convincingly

'I thought it was going to hit, and I was just wondering what it was going to do,' he said.

'I didn’t see it shatter, I just saw some of the commentators brushing away a bit of glass, so it was a good thing it didn’t shatter everywhere and the ball didn’t go through.

'I think another window up here (outside the players’ dressing room) had that shattered look to it, and I’m glad no-one got injured out of it.'

The damaging batsmen, who has also been in good form with the ball, said he was 'just trying to adjust' to the conditions of being out in the middle.

'I didn’t see the first ball that was bowled to me from the other end, I was just trying to adjust to being out in the middle again but that one felt really nice, right out of the middle.'
