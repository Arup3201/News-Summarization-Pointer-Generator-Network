Misfiring strikers Emmanuel Riviere and Siem de Jong need 'just one break' in front of goal to kick-start Newcastle's season, according to Alan Pardew.

Newcastle eased to a 1-0 Capital One Cup second-round victory at Gillingham on Tuesday - but only courtesy of John Egan's own goal.

Newcastle's entire squad have drawn blanks in the first three matches of the new campaign, leaving Pardew admitting his St James' Park stars must quickly sharpen up.

The Tyneside club's boss believes his new forwards will need a crucial slice of finishing fortune to see off Crystal Palace in Saturday's home Barclays Premier League clash.

'I just think we've shown real solid team performances in the three matches so far, without really getting a break in front of goal,' said Pardew.

'So many times we could have got a break tonight and we could have got a second or third goal and it didn't happen for us.

'I'm hoping to get a break on Saturday, we just need one break.

'It would be nice to score two or more goals on Saturday.

'The way Palace play, how quick they are on the break, you sense that they could score, so it might mean we do need to get two or three goals so that's what our focus must be.'

Sky Bet League One side Gillingham never threatened Newcastle's chances of coasting to victory at Priestfield Road, the hosts also toothless in front of goal.

Pardew admitted relief at victory but slight frustrations at his side's lack of cohesion.

Summer signing De Jong was unable to forge a flowing partnership with Riviere, despite lively showings from Gabriel Obertan and full debutant Rolando Aarons.

'The scoreline didn't really reflect our dominance,' said Pardew.

'I've been here many times as a manager. I've played here, and done a lot of scouting here too.

'It's a very, very difficult place to come. And yet we controlled the game more or less all the way through.

'I'm pleased but a bit frustrated we didn't score more than the one.

'They gave up a lot of space in midfield to play that extra centre-half. It was difficult to penetrate their three centre-halves.

'But I can't be too disappointed, I thought our application to the game was great. Our two centre-halves typified that, particularly the skipper.

'Absolute respect we showed Gillingham tonight, and that's how you get wins at places like this.'

Gillingham boss Peter Taylor was at a loss to find reason for his side's fourth own goal in six matches of the embryonic season.

'It's absolutely amazing; incredible,' said Taylor of Gillingham's own-goal glut.

'That's the way it goes, hopefully there will be no more.

'It's a little unlucky on John, and being a Sunderland boy as well.

'He's got a great head on him, so he'll be fine.

'I don't think it's anything we're doing wrong.

'There's nothing we're doing to encourage that, it's just one of those things.

'The only thing I'm disappointed with is that we didn't have 90 minutes' belief.'
