Nick Clegg was accused of 'working 
against' his Coalition partners last night after he demanded yet more 
changes to the Government's troubled NHS reforms.

The Deputy Prime Minister has got 
David Cameron's agreement to a string of amendments after first signing 
off the legislation when it was originally introduced and then obtaining
a series of changes last spring.

Mr Clegg said that if the latest 
changes, which will limit competition and the role of the private 
sector, are approved by Parliament the reforms should be 'allowed to 
proceed'.

The concessions agreed by the Prime 
Minister will help the Lib Dem leader survive his party's spring 
conference next month which is likely to be dominated by angry demands 
from anti-privatisation activists.

But Mr Clegg's behaviour was called 
'outrageous' by Tory backbenchers who said he should be bound by 
collective Cabinet responsibility.

The changes were announced in a letter
from Mr Clegg and Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams. It was sent to all Lib
Dem peers and MPs as the House of Lords reconvened to debate the Health
and Social Care Bill.

The controversial legislation will 
give GPs control of most of the NHS budget and open up the Health 
Service to greater competition from the private and voluntary sector.

Mr Clegg and Baroness Williams said 
competition in the NHS must be in the 'interests of patients and not 
profits', adding: 'Given how precious the NHS is, we want to rule out 
beyond doubt any threat of a U.S.-style market in the NHS.

'That is why we want to see changes 
made to this Bill that have been put forward by our Liberal Democrat 
team in the House of Lords to make sure that the NHS can never be 
treated like the gas, electricity and water industry.'

Mr Clegg said the
five changes he wants are his party's 'final' demands.

They will reduce the remit of the 
Competition Commission, require foundation trusts to put patients' 
interests first and get permission from their governors before carrying 
out extra private work, and force members of clinical commissioning 
groups to declare all financial interests.

Another amendment is designed to 
insulate the NHS from the full force of European competition law to 
prevent private takeovers of hospitals.

Mr Clegg's language in the letter is 
in stark contrast to the way he talked about the health reforms at the 
start of the Coalition.

Increasing competition in the health service brings benefits for patients and boosts productivity, according to a new report.

The centre-right think-tank Reform published 10 case studies from around the world showing how a 'radical change in the delivery of healthcare can result in improved quality and productivity'.

It said competition allows new organisations to run services better, more efficiently and often at a lower cost.

And it argued the Government must defend competition clauses in the Health and Social Care Bill as it passes through Parliament.

In examples from the US, the study says competition can cut hospital admissions and costs.

'In Rhode Island, a private company, Beacon Health Strategies, has created an integrated care pathway for mental healthcare services, which were previously highly fragmented,' it said.

'In one year the cost of mental healthcare hospitalisations for children was cut by 20 per cent.'

In summer 2010 he signed the foreword 
to the White Paper outlining the original reforms. And when the Bill was
introduced to Parliament he described them as a 'fusion' of the best of
Lib Dem and Tory principles.

But when Lib Dem activists rebelled at
their spring conference last March he changed his tune, demanding a 
'pause' in the progress of the Bill and a 'listening exercise' with NHS 
staff.

This led to a raft of changes, after which Lady Williams and other Lib Dems declared themselves satisfied.

However, rumblings from party 
activists and peers in advance of this year's spring conference appear 
to have forced Mr Clegg to demand more concessions.

A Whitehall source said Health 
Secretary Andrew Lansley was happy with the changes. It has yet to be 
decided whether Tory peers will be pressured to vote for the new 
amendments.

It appears Mr Clegg's letter came as a
surprise to many of his Coalition partners. Some observers say, 
however, it was a stage-managed enterprise to put him in a better light 
with his grassroots.

In the morning, the Prime Minister's 
spokesman said they did not see the need for any 'significant changes' 
to the Bill, while at lunchtime Tory health minister Simon Burns 
insisted the whole Government backed the Bill 'as amended now'.

But in the afternoon, Mr Cameron's spokesman revealed he had agreed to the changes the Lib Dems wanted.

Tory backbencher Priti Patel said: 'It
is outrageous that Nick Clegg is being allowed to do this. He is a 
member of the Cabinet and he should be signed up to collective 
responsibility.

'He should be putting the case to his 
Lib Dem colleagues as to why we need this Bill. He should not be 
actively working against the Government. It is not good enough that 
David Cameron is going along with this.'Â
