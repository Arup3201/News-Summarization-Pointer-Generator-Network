Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle offered an officer $100 for a massage while he was being booked into a Texas jail for stealing underwear and cologne.

The 22-year-old joked with officers, accused others of drink driving and showed concern over how is mugshot looked after he was arrested and fined $29,500 for shoplifting from a Dillard's store.

Video footage from inside Frisco City Jail obtained by CBS DFW shows the NFL star wearing a white sleeveless shirt and calling his agent saying he had been 'jammed up' and needed 'bond' so he could make it to practice the following day.

He also appears to be disrespectful to officers and admits that he hopes his arrest isn't on the news.

Disrespectful: The 22-year-old then asks a female officer whether she will give him a massage for $100

Plea for help: He also calls his agent saying he had been 'jammed up' and needed 'bond' so he could make it to practice the following day

Appearance: Randle also asked to see his mugshot once it was taken, concerned at how it may look 

'Hey, is this going to be on the news, you think?' he asks. 

As the officer is going through his health history, Randle then jokes about taking medical marijuana and compares his case to the arrest of Ray Rice.

Listing his personal belongings, the officer states that he has more than $300 in cash on him and a number of credit cards. The items he stole cost substantially less. 

Following the arrest, he was controversial offered a deal with an underwear company. 

The 22-year-old landed the contract in a bid to atone for his crime, revealing he will donate $15,000 of the brand's apparel to children in need. 

'There is no excuse for my mistake last week, and I take full responsibility for my actions,' Randle said, via ESPNDallas.com. 

'I let down my coaches, teammates, and family. 

'My agent and I have spent a lot of time looking for ways I can turn my situation into a learning experience for young people. 

'Partnering with MeUndies allows me the opportunity to give back to others less fortunate than myself, and spread a positive message of not making the same mistake twice.' 

Randle, who signed a four-year, $2.35 million contract last year, was charged with Class B misdemeanour theft of underwear and cologne between the value of $50 to $500.

Police attended the Dillard's store at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco, north of Dallas, at 8.17pm, after the young NFL star was detained by security staff. 

A police spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Randle tried to take a pack of two black Polo underwear valued at $39.50  and a small bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne priced at $84.

Randle, whose base salary this season is $495,000, was released from custody on Tuesday morning after posting bail of $350, police confirmed.

Although behind DeMarco Murray in the Cowboys' pecking order, Randle played a key role in their side's win over defending Super Bowl champions Seattle on Sunday.

Against the league's top rushing defence, Randle rushed for 52 yards in their 30-23 win at CenturyLink Field.

Randle came to the Cowboys as  a fifth-round draft pick from Oklahoma State in 2013 and it is hoped he can take pressure off Cowboys' workhorse superstar Murray.
