British eventing star William Fox-Pitt is within sight of his first major individual championship title after performing a cross-country masterclass in punishing conditions at the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games.

Britain also hold second spot in the team competition after resilient displays from Zara Phillips (High Kingdom) and Tina Cook (De Novo News), which ensured Britain finished the day with four riders inside the top 15.

Oliver Townend and Black Tie were the only British combination not to finish.

Masterclass: British eventing star William Fox-Pitt could win his first major individual championship title

World number one Fox-Pitt, Cook and Phillips, with 186.8, are three fences behind the Germans heading into the jumping finale in Caen on Sunday.

The cross-country track proved so demanding that no combination from 91 starters finished inside an optimum time of 10 minutes 30 seconds.

But the day was tinged with tragedy for the Great Britain team after Harry Meade’s horse Wild Lone collapsed and died after completing the cross-country course.
