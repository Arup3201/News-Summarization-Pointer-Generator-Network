Arrest: Sharon Ferguson allegedly dumped her baby boy in a trash can after giving birth

A mother has been arrested after she gave birth, wrapped the newborn boy in a plastic bag and dumped him in the trash, police said.

Sharon Ferguson, 28, was taken into police custody outside a liquor store in Greenville, South Carolina on Monday afternoon after the conscious baby boy was discovered inside the trash.

A family spokesperson said she is mentally ill and homeless, WYFF reported.

A homeowner had arrived to check on his rental home in the Nicholtown community when he noticed a trail of blood, which led him to the trash can.

When he looked inside, he discovered the newborn boy, who was wrapped in a plastic grocery bag, which was inside a pink blood-covered blanket, police told Fox Carolina.

'We
 found what looked to be blood outside of a trash can, and a little bit 
on the ground,' Officer Jonathan Bragg told WYFF. 'At 
that point we started digging around and found the newborn inside the 
trash can.'

The baby was alive, but he was in critical condition. Neighbors reported seeing him moving when he was pulled out of the trash can.

Authorities said they did not know how long the child had been there.

The South Carolina Department of Social Services said the baby was in 'good condition' on Tuesday afternoon and will be put into foster care before the department likely takes custody.

WYFF reported that Ferguson allegedly admitted to giving birth to the boy on Monday and then discarding him in the bin.

She was charged with one count of attempted murder and one count of unlawful neglect of a child or helpless person, and her bond was set at $125,000.

She was taken to the hospital on Tuesday after asking to receive treatment. She had initially denied medical attention on Monday.

A family spokesman told WFYY that Ferguson suffers a 'diagnosed mental illness'.

Shaken: Neighbors on the street said they hoped the woman finally got the help that she needed

A neighbor said she could not tell that Ferguson, who wore the same clothes every day, was pregnant but said that she believed the woman was mentally ill.

'It was at times disturbing, Shanika Cohens said. 'She was pretty much a loner. She walked the streets day in and day out but didn't bother anybody.'

Another neighbor, Tracy Fant, said her mental illness should have been taken into consideration by the authorities when she was charged.

'They need to downgrade the charges and get her help,' Fant said. 'She didn't know what she was doing or what was going on with her body.'

Authorities said officers are looking into mental health concerns.
