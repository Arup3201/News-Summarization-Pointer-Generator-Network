One in five Britons wants to stop using cash, a study has found.

The research was undertaken after five leading banks said they would allow account holders to make payments to friends and retailers with their mobile phones.

The findings by consumer analysts Mintel showed 18 per cent of Britainâ€™s internet users would prefer to go completely cashless.

One in five Britons wants to stop using cash, a study has found. The research was undertaken after five leading banks said they would allow account holders to make payments to friends and retailers with their mobile phones

Over a third (38 per cent) were interested in making mobile payments â€“ and an enthusiastic 8 per cent said they would apply right away. 

Support for a cashless society is greatest in London, where 30 per cent of residents said they were ready to say goodbye to cash.

Toby Clark, director of research at Mintel, said this was because London already had the infrastructure, and added: â€˜A major shift is on the horizon, and the integration of mobiles into payments has only just begun.

Over a third (38 per cent) were interested in making mobile payments -  and an enthusiastic 8 per cent said they would apply right away

'As mobile payment and wallet services become more widely available, and more intuitive and efficient to use, it will be difficult for consumers to resist adopting them.

'While just eight per cent of Brits claim they would apply for a mobile payment system straight away, across an adult population of around 50 million adults, that still represents a potential user base of four million people: there is a huge market out there if providers are able to come up with a product that represents a tangible upgrade to existing technology.'

Support for a cashless society is greatest in London where 30 per cent of residents would be happy to stop using cash altogether.

However, the figure declines to just 13 per cent of those living in the South West and Wales and 14 per cent of those living in the North and Scotland.

Mr Clark said: 'The fact that Londoners are most comfortable with a cashless society reflects the region's head start on the rest of the country in terms of payment system infrastructure and that new payment technologies, such as contactless cards, tend be launched in London first.

'However, there are huge swathes of the population which remain attached to cash, and the reality is that cash still has a long life ahead of it.'

Cash remains the most widely and frequently used payment method in Britain. Researchers found 99 per cent of Brits use cash, and only debit cards come close to rivalling it. However, one in 50 Brits (two per cent) say they have never used a plastic card.

Mr Clark added: 'It is not about any one payment method.

'People use multiple payment technologies, and if they can see a clear reason for changing their habits then they are willing to incorporate new ones, such as PayPal.

'Use of a particular payment method is largely determined by context. Cash dominates for small transactions on the high street, but for online and for high value transactions, debit and plastic cards are the payment methods of choice.'
