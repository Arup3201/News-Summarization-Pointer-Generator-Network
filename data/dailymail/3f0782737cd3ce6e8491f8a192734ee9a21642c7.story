A cafe owner left heartbroken at seeing a beach lying lost beneath a mountain of rubble bought it from the Queen for £1 - and then spent £100,000 turning it back into a sandy haven.

Gordon Hadfield, 59, was appalled at the state of the beach, which had been left for 30 years as an illegal dumping ground for concrete and rusting metal.

The cafe owner longed for the day when children could return to build sandcastles and safely stroll along the seashore again at Swanbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan.

But after negotiating to buy the site from the Queen's Crown Estate for just £1 two years ago, the real cost quickly escalated to more than £100,000, with a mechanical digger setting him back £30,000 alone.

Yesterday, as people started returning to the beach, he said the project had been worth every penny.

The grandfather-of-five Mr Hadfield said: 'I don't like to put a cost on it but my 60th birthday is coming up and I told my family all I wanted is for the beach to be cleared up.

'It was ruined 30 years ago - my cafe overlooks the beach but it was an eyesore with rubbish strewn over it from top to bottom.

'It has been hard work and in the past few weeks we have had to remove tonnes of rubble by hand.

'You would not believe what we have dug out, including metal piping and bars, reinforced concrete and all sorts of rubbish.

'It was a difficult job and cost a considerable amount of money - we did it when the money was available and we could afford it.

'I'm over the moon with it and so is everyone else.'

Mr Hadfield said: 'It's great for the area and it's great to see people fishing and using the beach again.'

Mr Hadfield said: 'I have done this for my grandchildren and all children - that's where I will get my pleasure from.'

He added: 'I have done this for my grandchildren and all children - that's where I will get my pleasure from.

'It's great for the area and it's great to see people fishing and using the beach again.

'Even though I have seen it every day I still appreciate that it's a fantastic area and we are fortunate to have it on our own doorstep.'

The debris from a demolished cement works was dumped over Swanbridge beach when work was being carried out to strengthen a sea wall in September 1984. 

Vale of Glamorgan Council removed some metal bars from the beach but said it could not justify removing all the rubble at taxpayers' expense.

Mr Hadfield, owner of the Seashore Grill and Cafe, said: 'It was just so dangerous for dogwalkers and children.

'One of our main concerns was to get the beach back to being safe so people could use it again.'

'But it was one of those things - if you want something doing then do it yourself.

'It has taken a lot of hard work, battling in all sorts of conditions, it was particularly hard on dark, cold winter days.

'But 30 years on it is fantastic to see the beach back to what it was.'

Mr Hadfield spent £30,000 of his own money on a digger with the rest of the project costing him a further £70,000

Lis Sourlis said: 'I used to take my nieces and nephews to the beach as at one moment we had a beautiful beach, and the next moment they had dropped all this stuff over it.'

Jeff Higgins - who helped clear the rubble - said: 'People are over the moon with what has happened here here.

'Visitors come from far and wide and say how nice it is to see the beach back to how it used to be and that they will be able to enjoy it again.

'I have lived here for 16 years and all that time I have had people saying we need to get the beach cleared so they could use it again.' 

Mr Higgins said that sand and shale would naturally return to the beach, making it look as though the flytippers had never been.

Villager Lis Sourlis, who campaigned for 30 years to get the beach back to its former glory, said: 'It seemed like an insurmountable task.

'We lost 30 years of beach use because of what happened.

'I used to take my nieces and nephews to the beach as at one moment we had a beautiful beach, and the next moment they had dropped all this stuff over it.

'It is wonderful what Gordon has done. He deserves to be honoured.'
