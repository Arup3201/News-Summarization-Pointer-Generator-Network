Pupils as young as 11 will be able to gain a qualification in ‘body image’ in a new initiative to tackle hang-ups about size and weight.

The YMCA has developed a course for secondary school pupils aimed at building ‘confidence and self-esteem’ and reducing anxiety about appearance.

Youngsters completing the qualification - targeted at 11 to 14-year-olds - will receive an award at the same level as a D to G grade at GCSE.

Backing: The course is supported by Team GB Olympic weightlifter Zoe Smith, who suffered abuse on Twitter over her body shape

Self-esteem: Smith said that many young girls were put off playing sport because of insecurities over their body

The course - which could be offered in schools next year - involves eight to 10 hours of study and includes tasks such as ‘give an example of a positive and negative portrayal of bodies in the media’.

The YMCA, which runs its own exam board offering qualifications in health and fitness, said the body image course aimed to help youngsters ‘build a more positive body image’ and a healthier lifestyle.

But critics said schools were being bombarded with social issues to tackle in lessons and warned that the qualification could undermine time available for core academic subjects.

One teacher took to Twitter to ask: ‘Anything else you’d like us to teach? We’ve got LOADS of free curriculum time.’

The initiative follows a report earlier this year from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image which called for children to be given ‘body image and self-esteem’ lessons.

Children as young as five worried about their size and appearance, it said.

Most people were dissatisfied with their body image and one in five had been bullied or victimised because of their weight.

The new course is backed by teenage Olympic weightlifter Zoe Smith, who has suffered vile Twitter abuse over her muscular appearance.

‘Sports and exercise are one of the best ways of feeling good about yourself, but so many young people still feel uncomfortable about taking part, often because they are worried about what they look like,’ she said.

New course: The YMCA qualification in body image will be aimed at 11-to-14 year olds and is aimed at building 'confidence and self-esteem'

Plans for the course have been submitted to exams watchdog Ofqual for approval. It is intended to be taught in PSHE (personal, social and health education), free study periods or youth clubs.

Draft lesson plans show the course will be split into two parts, one aimed at giving children an understanding of body image and the other focusing on exercise and healthy eating.

Pupils will be required to complete a workbook, produce a website article, book onto sessions of different activities and make a healthy packed lunch

The YMCA said nearly one in six young people have said they would rather be thin than healthy. The qualification would help stop health and well-being being ‘equated with a particular body shape’.
