Andrew Flintoff has confirmed his return to Lancashire five years after retiring from cricket.

As revealed by Sportsmail, England’s 2005 Ashes hero, 36, is to play Twenty20 cricket for his former county after proving his fitness.

Flintoff plans to have a run out at the weekend playing for St Annes in the Northern League, where he was a junior.

He will play a 2nd XI game for Lancashire next week and will then be unleashed in T20s, where his squad number will be 26.

Flintoff said: 'I'm really honoured to be part of Lancashire once again. It is something that I never thought would happen but after training with the squad over the last few months I am really happy that they have invited me to play. 

'I have 
worked really hard to get back to my fittest and I hope that we have a 
successful summer. I'm just glad that I can be part of it.'

His first game back could be against Yorkshire in a televised game at Old Trafford next Friday.His inclusion would boost the attendance. 

Lancashire cricket director Mike 
Watkinson said: 'We are delighted to have Fred involved once again at 
the club. He is Lancashire through and through and his record for both 
club and country speaks for itself.

Returning hero: Flintoff's comeback was first revealed by Sportsmail

'Fred has been back at Emirates Old Trafford under his own steam since the winter and has been working with the Academy and in the nets with some of the other players. Over a period of time he has picked up on his physical conditioning and this continues to improve.

'He has shown in practice that he still has plenty of class with bat and ball, and will be a great addition to the NatWest T20 Blast squad.'

Sportsmail
 first revealed Flintoff was considering a remarkable comeback after 
some time coaching academy players and that he had been bowling at more 
than 80mph in the nets.

His fitness surprised observers, although Flintoff was torn between the temptation to return and endangering his legacy.

He
 retired in 2009 following a series of operations but rest away from the
 game has helped him to recover sufficiently and attempt this return.

In his years away from cricket, Flintoff has explored other options - including one bout of professional boxing.

He represented England in 79 Tests, 141 one-day internationals and seven Twenty20 games. He also made 80 first-class appearances for the Red Rose, scoring 4,042 runs at 35.14 and taking 92 wickets at 29.16.

Flintoff's Lancashire Twenty20 record consists of 16 games, averaging 13.94 with the ball and 29.64 with the bat, with a high score of 93 against Derbyshire in 2009.

A
 source told Sportsmail: ‘Freddie’s body has recovered with rest away 
from the demands of professional sport. He is fit and raring to go.’

Kevin Pietersen will not play for Surrey on Friday because of a finger injury. The county say he will be available to face Essex next Saturday.
