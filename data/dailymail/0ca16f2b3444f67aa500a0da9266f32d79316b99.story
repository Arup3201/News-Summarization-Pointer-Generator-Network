Prince Harry made a grovelling apology and Tory MP Aidan Burley attracted public vilification.

But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday offered no hint of shame for wearing a Nazi uniform while at university, brushing it off as ‘a laugh’.

In an interview likely to be seen as deeply insensitive, Mr Balls said he was ‘not embarrassed’ by the photo unearthed by the Daily Mail four years ago, saying the costume was handed to him as a prank by fellow students at Oxford.

Shameless: Ed Balls, on the left, wearing Nazi 
uniform. Mr Balls said he was 'not embarrassed' by the photo taken at a Christmas dinner while
 he was a student at Oxford in 1987 and brushed it off as 'a laugh'

He was speaking ahead of the keynote speech by leader Ed Miliband at the Labour party conference in Manchester, in which he is set to tell delegates how his parents fled Nazi persecution.

‘Of course I’m not embarrassed by it’, Mr Balls told the Huffington Post website. ‘If I had the choice again, would I do it? No. Is there a difference between being 20 and being 40? Yes.

'I went along with it for a laugh. In retrospect I wouldn’t do it again.’

He told an interviewer the uniform was handed to him by ‘the left caucus’ at Keble College, Oxford at the end-of-term Christmas dinner in 1987.

Then known as Eddie, the future 
cabinet minister, was then president of the Junior Common Room, the 
college’s elected student body and had during that term vetoed student 
calls for a rent freeze - in favour of an unpopular 2.5 per cent rise.

Not an 'alpha male': Mr Balls insisted he shares cooking and shopping at home with his wife Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary

Mr Balls had, shortly before the photo emerged in 2008, called for pupils from every school in Britain to visit Nazi death camps in Poland - and when David Cameron criticised the scheme as a gimmick, described it as a ‘disgraceful remark’.

He was more bashful about the incident when questioned last year when he told a magazine: ‘At the Christmas dinner, the members decided that the committee should be required to wear costumes.

'Mine was chosen by them. They decided I was a dictator.

‘When you’re 20, and it’s the Christmas dinner, do you make a stand as a matter of principle, or do you go along with it? I went along with it. Everyone has their regrets, I’m sure.’

In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Balls was asked what he would like to be written on his tombstone, to which he replied: ‘I think I probably couldn’t give a flying toss.

He went on: ‘There is something fabulous and noble and tragic about people whose reputations are finally rehabilitated and discovered thirty, forty or fifty years later.

'In some cases, that can almost be the most selfless thing. Those people are not the kind of people who worry about what’s on their tombstone.’

Asked about what he might do if his political career ended, he said he was full of admiration for doctors, and had thought about following his father - an eminent professor of cell biology - into medicine, but said he had ‘sight of blood issues’. If choosing again, he said he would be a head teacher.

Asked about his image as a ‘bruiser’ or ‘attack dog’, he was said to become irritated, saying: ‘If I was 5’ 5” and 11 stone they wouldn’t call me a bruiser.’

He added that he did not consider himself an ‘alpha male’, saying he did the cooking and shopping in the home he shares with his wife, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and their three children.

‘This morning, before I got on the train, I spent three-quarters of an hour doing my piano lesson,’ he added.
