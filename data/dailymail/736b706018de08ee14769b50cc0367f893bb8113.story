Thousands in Washington attended the 91st Annual National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony on Friday for the chance to see the first family celebrate the holiday season, but it was one of the performer's children who got the closest to President Obama.

At the end of the ceremony, singer Mariah Carey joined the president on stage holding her two-year-old daughter Monroe.

The president is pictured smiling at Carey's toddler, who doesn't seem to recognize the president or that he's an important person.

After the event, Carey tweeted a picture of the meeting, saying 'What an honor to kick off the holiday season with the First Family'.

At the beginning of the ceremony, 
first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama joined their parents on stage to 
flip the switch and turn on the lights to the National Christmas Tree.

President
 Obama joked that he would only count down from five to light the tree, 
since he didn't want to keep anyone waiting in the rainy weather.

'It's a little wet out there, so we shouldn't start at 10,' the president said.

The president then flipped the switch and the tree sprung into multicolored life.

The ceremony became an annual White House tradition in 1923 during the Calvin Coolidge Administration when first lady Grace Coolidge allowed DC public schools to erect a Christmas tree on the White House Ellipse.

On Christmas Eve, President Coolidge lit the tree by walking onto a the Ellipse and pressing a button.

Every year since then, the White House has had a designated National Christmas Tree.

Lighting
 the tree was stopped briefly from 1942 to 1944, during World War II but
 took up again in 1945 when President Truman lit the tree.

'This
 is the Christmas that a war-weary world has prayed for through long and
 awful years. With peace comes joy and gladness. The gloom of the war 
years fades as once more we light the National Community Christmas 
Tree,' President Truman said at the ceremony.

Following President
 Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, the ceremony was postponed until exactly 30 days later to observe the period of national 
mourning.

'Today we come to the end of a season of great 
national sorrow,' President Johnson said at the ceremony, 'and to the 
beginning of the season of great, eternal joy.'

The tree 
lighting made some major changes during the most recent Bush 
administration, when LED lights were used to decorate the tree and make 
it more energy-efficient.
