The perfect woman: A poll of 2,000 women revealed many would love the eyes of Nicole Scherzinger, the nose of Samantha Cameron and the hair of Katherine Jenkins.

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder - or in the toned abs of Jessica Ennis, Beyonce's legs and Samantha Cameron's nose, according to a poll on the perfect celebrity body.

Researchers also found the average British woman would love to have wavy hair like Katherine Jenkins, Kelly Brook's waistline and eyes like Nicole Scherzinger.

The answers given by 2,000 women on their changing attitudes to body image also revealed one in five have 'given up' trying to improve their body shape.

Commissioned by Morrisons to launch its NuMe range of healthier food, the survey also found people are working harder on their own bodies, with 46 per cent stating they would always strive to keep improving their health and fitness.

Meanwhile, 61 per cent said starting a healthy eating regime would give an instant boost to their confidence and a quarter said avoiding chocolate would help them feel better about their figures.

One in three go to the gym as their quick fix to feeling healthier, while 13 per cent said a shopping trip would have the same effect.

When asked if diets worked in the long run, 48 per cent felt they didn't.

Bryonie Holleart, nutritionist for Morrirons NuMe, said the findings revealed a window into the 'quick-fix' nature of people's eating habits.

She said: 'While we all want to look like a celebrity, we know getting that perfect body requires hard work - both in the gym and in the kitchen.

'It's clear too that many people will give up their best intentions, often because it's hard to keep cooking healthy meals, maintain an expensive diet plan, all while putting in hours in on the treadmill.

'Often though, just making a few, small, simple changes to your lifestyle can have a big effect.'
