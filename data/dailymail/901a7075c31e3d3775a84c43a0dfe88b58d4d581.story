Cheng Tan is suing the law firm McDermott Will & Emery for unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and maternity discrimination

A high-flying lawyer claims she was 'ambushed', forced out of her £100,000 a year job and ordered to pay back her maternity pay after she took more than six months leave because of medical problems, a tribunal heard.

Cheng Tan, 40, who had a complicated caesarean section, was head-hunted to join the London office of the prestigious American law firm McDermott Will & Emery as a trademark specialist.

But the mother-of-two claims she was made the sole victim of redundancy from the firm after she told her bosses she needed more than six months' maternity leave to recover after a series of operations.

And she alleges that at one point bosses even demanded that she pay back £18,000 maternity pay.

In a witness statement to the Central London Employment Tribunal she said: 'I was made redundant because I had had a baby, taken maternity leave and suffered illness as a result of the birth.'

Ms Tan gave birth on 5 May 2011 to a baby girl through emergency caesarean section, but there were complications and both Ms Tan and her newborn needed continued hospital treatment.

The Malaysian-born lawyer underwent two gruelling operations to repair organs that had been damaged during the childbirth.

Initially, she hoped to return after six months because she would be eligible for a bonus. But she claims after she told bosses she was suffering complications from the surgery they selected her for redundancy.

She was called to a meeting on 3 November 2011 and told she faced redundancy. In her witness statement Ms Tan said: 'I felt ambushed.

'I had no one accompanying me, was still not fully well following the complications that had followed the birth of my second child, and at the meeting that I had asked for to discuss my return to work I was suddenly being faced with what appeared to be a pre-prepared meeting to tell me that I was redundant.'

And the Leicester and King’s College London graduate said that she had been made to feel sidelined by the firm before she had even taken her maternity leave.

The firm moved to the Heron Tower where offices were handed out depending on status, but the heavily pregnant lawyer was given a windowless room because she was about to have her baby.

She claims her boss made the decision because she was only going to have to ‘sit in there’ for 4-6 weeks before having her baby.

Ms Tan told the tribunal: 'I strongly believed I was being treated unfairly and unfavourably regarding this issue because of my imminent maternity leave.'

While on leave she discussed her 
return with her boss Gary Moss and other senior staff, but received no 
indication that there were any problems until she told them about her 
surgical complications.

She
said: 'Gary said it was important that I should concentrate on getting 
well and, as and when, I was ready I would be welcomed back to the 
department and I was a valued member of the team.'

But Mr Moss left the company while she was away.

'I felt tricked, cheated and betrayed'- Cheng Tan during her employment tribunal 

During the redundancy meeting Ms Tan wondered aloud why she was being got rid of and mentioned it felt like 'anyone who is not white will be fired' by her boss Hiroshi Sheraton.

She insisted it was not a formal allegation of race discrimination but the firm used it to keep her out of the office until they had finished an investigation, it is claimed.

Ms Tan said she was thrown into a 'nightmare' and that her boss even tried to get her to hand back £18,000 worth of maternity pay she had received, it is alleged.

She said: 'I could not believe that this was being asked of me. I was shocked and frightened by the prospect as I had not budgeted for it.'

She added: 'Needless to say, I felt tricked, cheated and betrayed. I could not shake off the notion that Hiroshi did this deliberately to victimise me since I challenged his decision on redundancy and had not ‘gone quietly’.'

The firm also told her that she would only get her full redundancy pay - the equivalent of seven weeks wages - if she agreed not to bring any claim against them, it is alleged.

She was formally dismissed on redundancy grounds on 29 November last year. She is suing the firm for unfair dismissal, pregnancy, maternity and sex discrimination, indirect age discrimination and victimisation.

McDermott Will & Emery strongly deny the allegations and in a statement to the tribunal they claim she was made redundant because there wasn’t enough work.

They claim they had provisionally earmarked Ms Tan’s job for redundancy but 'the decision was made not to raise her provisional redundancy with her while she was suffering the significant ill effects of the birth.'

They deny 'that there was any link between the claimant’s provisional selection and her maternity leave or related illness.'

Instead they say she was axed because her charge-out rate was higher and she didn’t have the breadth of experience of others at the firm.

The tribunal continues.
