U.S. special forces failed in an attempt to free the British hostage who ISIS militants have threatened to kill, it has emerged.

Jihadist militants released a second sickening video on Tuesday which showed U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff being beheaded by a fighter with an English accent.

At the end of the video, a British hostage is filmed on his knees in a similar orange jumpsuit to those worn by the two men already killed by the extremist group, sparking fears he could be their next victim.

It is believed the British hostage, who is not being named by UK media, and James Foley (pictured), who was the first man killed in the videos, were the subject of a failed  rescue mission earlier this summer

It has now come to light that the man - who MailOnline is not identifying him at the request of the British government but who has been named and pictured around the world - was the subject of a failed rescue attempt by U.S. commandos earlier this summer.

Last month the Pentagon revealed it had launched the attempt to rescue a number of hostages held in Syria, including James Foley, the journalist killed in the first video.

But the mission failed to bring back any hostages because the jihadist gang had moved prior to American commandos' arrival.

The British hostage is believed to be an aid worker who was based on the Turkish border of Syria, working with victims of war.

Government sources have stressed that Britain has a long-standing principle not to publicize kidnappers or terrorists. But UK authorities are in touch with the man's family and are continuing to provide support for them, it is understood.

It comes as President Barack Obama has said that America will not be intimidated by the 'horrific' violence of the Islamic State following the brutal execution of Mr Sotloff.

David Cameron, who will meet NATO leaders in Wales later this week, has branded the latest video 'absolutely disgusting and despicable'

Speaking in Tallinn, Estonia, Mr Obama vowed that 'justice will be served' and that a coalition will be built to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS, which has taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq.

However, failed to give a timeline for deciding on a strategy to attack the terror group's operations, saying: 'It'll take time to roll them back'.

Mr Obama spoke at a news conference with President Toomas Hendrik Ilves after arriving in Estonia to show solidarity with Baltic leaders who fear they could be the next target of Russia's aggression.

During the conference, he added that the prayers of the American people are with the family of the 'devoted and courageous journalist' Mr Sotloff, who deeply loved the Islamic world and whose 'life stood in stark contrast to those who murdered him so brutally.'

 Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement that he would chair an emergency response meeting with his Cabinet on Wednesday to review the latest developments.

Mr Cameron has hit out at the ‘absolutely disgusting, despicable’ murder of Mr Sotloff.

He said: 'If verified, this is a despicable and barbaric murder. My thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sotloff’s family and friends tonight as they deal with this appalling and tragic situation.

 Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished in Syria in August 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed Foley's beheading. 

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the Islamic State.

In the video distributed on Tuesday and titled 'A Second Message to America,' Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the Islamic State, the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq and declared itself a caliphate. 

The executioner appears to be the same man who killed Foley – known as ‘Jihadi John’ - and tells the camera: 'I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.'  

He warned President Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, 'our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.'

The footage - depicting what the U.S. called a sickening act of brutality - was posted two weeks after the release of video showing the killing of James Foley and just days after Sotloff's mother pleaded for his life.

Barak Barfi, a spokesman for the family said: 'The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately. There will be no public comment from the family during this difficult time,' Barfi said.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday that the world was 'outraged' at what they had seen.

'We are all outraged at reports from Iraq about the brutal killing of civilians by ISIL, including yesterday's (Tuesdays) reported brutal beheading of another journalist,' he said. 

In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. intelligence analysts will work as quickly as possible to determine if the video is authentic. 

He said it is believed that 'a few' Americans are still being held by the ISIS. 

Psaki would not give any specifics, but one is a 26-year-old woman kidnapped while doing humanitarian aid work in Syria, according to a family representative who asked that the hostage not be identified out of fear for her safety.

No statement: President Obama boarded Air Force One to Estonia yesterday without addressing the nation

The fighter who apparently beheads Sotloff in the video calls it retribution for Obama's continued airstrikes against the group. 

The killer specifically mentions the recent U.S. airstrikes around the Mosul dam and the beleaguered Iraqi town of Amirli, making it unlikely that Sotloff was killed at the same time as Foley, as some analysts had speculated.

Over the weekend, Iraqi government forces with help from U.S. airstrikes broke the Islamic State's two-month siege of Amirli, a town where some 15,000 Shiite Turkmens had been stranded.

In a statement on Tuesday evening from U.S. Central Command, military officials said an airstrike conducted on Monday against Islamic State militants near the Mosul Dam damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles.

The SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, first reported the video's existence.

In a sign of disorganization - or perhaps dissension - in the extremist group's ranks, a faction of the Islamic State apparently posted the video early, before it was supposed to be released. In a later Twitter message, those responsible apologized and asked fellow jihadis not to 'reproach' them.

The Islamic State has terrorized rivals and civilians alike with widely publicized brutality as it seeks to expand a proto-state it has carved out on both sides of the border. In its rise to prominence over the past year, it has frequently published graphic photos and gruesome videos of bombings, beheadings and mass killings.

Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded with his captors for mercy, saying in a video that her son was 'an innocent journalist' and 'an honorable man' who 'has always tried to help the weak.'

Sotloff grew up in the Miami area, and graduated from Kimball Union Academy, a prep school in New Hampshire.

As a student at Kimball, Sotloff 'developed a passion for reporting and writing, a gift that he shared with people around the world, and this unthinkable act of terror has taken him from us far too soon,' New Hampshire Gov, Maggie Hassan said in a statement.

Sotloff then attended the University of Central Florida, which said he majored in journalism from 2002 to 2004 but apparently left without graduating.

Just how Sotloff made his way from Florida to Middle East hotspots is not clear. He published articles from Syria, Egypt and Libya in a variety of publications. Several focus on the plight of ordinary people in war-torn places.

In a statement, Foreign Policy magazine said it was saddened by news of his death and called him a 'brave and talented journalist' whose reporting 'showed a deep concern for the civilians caught in the middle of a brutal war.'

Time Editor Nancy Gibbs said Sotloff 'gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world.'

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican, said the new video demonstrates the Islamic State's 'barbarity across the region - beheading and crucifying those who don't share their ideology.' 

He said the U.S. and allies need to step up military action against the group, including through airstrikes.

At Sotloff's parents' home in Pinecrest, Florida, two police vehicles blocked the driveway Tuesday, and officers advised journalists to stay away. Friends of the family could be seen coming and going.

'Everyone's been concerned. Everyone is grieving,' neighbor Pepe Cazas said. 'It's terrible. I've been praying for him.'
