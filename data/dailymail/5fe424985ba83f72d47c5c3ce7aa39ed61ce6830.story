Schapelle Corby has told her parole officer that she is spending her outside prison time reading and on the beach rather than searching for work.

Corby’s parole officer, Ketut Sukiati, spent 10 minutes with the convicted drug smuggler, whose face was covered by a black scarf the entire time.

Ms Sukiati told News Corp Australia Corby gave no explanation as to why she wasn't searching for a job but said she wasn't bored being unemployed.

The parole officers comments come just weeks after she was photographer partying with sacked  Cronulla Sharks rugby league player Todd Carney and her sister, Mercedes.

‘I told her that it is not polite to cover her face like that, especially because she is in the Government office,’ Ms Sukiati said, according to news.com.au.

But Corby insisted to Ms Sukiati she was covering her face to avoid the media from photographing her.

The Sydney Morning Herald cites a parole document signed by Schapelle Corby that  ‘If I [Corby] cannot fulfil those requirements, I’m ready to be sent back to prison to undergo the rest of the sentence.’

Until 2017, Corby is required to stay in Bali, and report monthly to the Bali corrections board, dress respectfully for the officials and not use or distribute drugs in Bali.

The approved parole application also highlights Corby’s ambitions to design bikinis for her brother-in-law’s Kuta surf shop.

A month after her release in February, Corby’s parole was on the line, following her sister’s controversial interview with Seven Network program, Sunday Night.

Pressure for Schapelle’s re-arrest mounted, as Indonesian media networks criticised the Corby family over the interview which speculated that the 4.1 kilograms of marijuana in Schapelle’s boogie board bag ‘could have been from Indonesia’.

Mercedes talks to journalists in Bali, Indonesia, Thursday, March 6, 2014. She apologies for offending Indonesia in the Seven Network Program, Sunday Night. Mercedes ignored Indonesia's warning against an interview, which caused a review in Schapelle's parole.

Mercedes Corby apologies to Indonesian media ‘from the bottom of my [Mercedes] heart’ for any offence caused.

During that time, Corby showed signs of suicidal tendencies, with the prospect of returning to jail due to parole breach.

At the time, Corby’s brother-in-law, Wayan Widyartha, told Fairfax media that she was suffering from depression and hallucinations.

‘It’s like illusion of peoples… If she goes out, it’s like she’s still seeing people (crowding her). She’s still traumatised,’ Mr Widyartha said.

Schapelle Corby was convicted of smuggling marijuana in 2004 and jailed in Bali’s Kerobokan prison for nine years.

Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby was found guilty in 2005 for smuggling 4.1kilograms of marijuana into Bali, Indonesia.

While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide.

She was 36 years when released.

Corby’s parole officer was told she is currently still living with brother-in-law, Wayan Widyartha.

Schapelle Corby, 36, was released from Bali jail February 10. After spending nine years in prison for smuggling marijuana into Bali, Indonesia, Corby was granted parole in February.
