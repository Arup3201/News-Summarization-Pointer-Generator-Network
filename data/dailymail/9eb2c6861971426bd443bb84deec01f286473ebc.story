Chelsea came from behind to beat Swansea at Stamford Bridge as Diego Costa made it seven for the season with a hat-trick, while Arsenal and Manchester City drew 2-2 in a pulsating fixture at the Emirates Stadium.

Formation: 3-4-3

GK: Julian Speroni, Crystal Palace (vs Burnley), 7.5

Martha Kelner at Selhurst Park

Julian Speroni was the hero for Crystal Palace in a 0-0 draw, superbly saving an 84th minute penalty to secure a point for his side.

CB: Nathan Baker, Aston Villa (vs Liverpool), 8

Joe Bernstein at Anfield

Villa ensured another Anfield nightmare for Liverpool, with Baker crucial at the heart of defence. Often criticised, long with Philippe Senderos, he helped Paul Lambert's side to a clean sheet.  

CB: Vincent Kompany, Manchester City (vs Arsenal), 7.5

Rob Draper at the Emirates Stadium

Kompany was imperious at the back despite City conceding two goals on Saturday in an entertaining game. Had to cover for error-prone partner Martin Demichelis.

CB: John Stones, Everton (vs West Brom), 7.5

Laurie Whitwell at the Hawthorns

Back in the team for Sylvain Distin and showed why he deserves his England caps. A clean sheet alongside Phil Jagielka in a 2-0 win. 

DM: Fabian Delph, Aston Villa (vs Liverpool), 7.5

Chris Wheeler at the Etihad Stadium

Kicking on from his exploits with England, Delph produced another energetic midfield display to keep Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson, among others, quiet. 

CM: Jack Wilshere, Arsenal (vs Manchester City), 8

Rob Draper at the Emirates Stadium

When it looked like Wilshere would run out of space, he executed a lovely chip over his England team-mate Joe Hart for the equaliser. There are varying degrees of Wilshere, but this was him at his absolute best.

CM: Cesc Fabregas, Chelsea (vs Swansea), 8

Sami Mokbel at Stamford Bridge

Fabregas laid on for two of Costa’s three goals in a display that showed an underlying understanding the pair have already manufactured. 

AM: Christian Eriksen, Tottenham (vs Sunderland), 8.5

Nick Harris at the Stadium of Light

His goal from close range wasn't anything to ride home about, but his link-up play between midfield and attack has to be admired. A shining light in the 2-2 draw.

CF: Graziano Pelle, Southampton (vs Newcastle), 7.5

Sam Cunningham at St Mary's

Four goals in three games isn't a bad start for a Premier League newbie. A brace against Newcastle might have summoned Alan Pardew to the exit door. 

CF: Diego Costa, Chelsea (vs Swansea), 9.5

Sami Mokbel at Stamford Bridge

If Diego Costa had cost £100million he would still be worth it. He took his goal tally to seven in four games since arriving from Atletico Madrid for £32m with a hat-trick against Swansea 

Diego Costa netted a hat-trick against Swansea, he now has seven goals in just four Premier League games 

CF: Romelu Lukaku, Everton (vs West Brom), 8

Laurie Whitwell at the Hawthorns

Lukaku netted his first goal for Everton since signing for the club permanently, and what a strike it was. Roberto Martinez said he has 'absolutely everything'.
