More than 22,000 troops in the British Army have been found to be overweight over the last three years, new figures reveal.

Serving personnel who have been deemed overweight are putting themselves at risk of a host of health problems – including Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and shortness of breath.

The figures, released by the Ministry of Defence, also reveal how a total of 32,419 male and female soldiers have failed the Army’s basic fitness test – which includes press-ups, sit-ups and a run – over the last three years.

The statistics, which are from March 2011 to March 
this year and include troops who may have served on the front line at Camp 
Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, state that 29,600 men and 2,819 women failed the standard personal fitness assessment.

The MoD states that servicemen under the age of 30 must be able to do 50 sit-ups within two minutes and 44 press-ups within the same period of time, as well as a 1.5mile run in under 10 minutes and 30 seconds.

Female troops in the same age bracket must be able to complete 50 sit-ups, 21 press-ups and run the 1.5mile stretch in 13 minutes or less.

Once a year, troops are also expected to take part in an eight-mile march - carrying a rucksack weighing up to 25kg - and complete it within two hours.

All service personnel in the British Army must complete the personal fitness assessment twice a year, and any troops who fail must retake the test within seven days.

Repeated failures could result in disciplinary action which could eventually lead to a soldier being discharged.

The MoD said 50 troops had been dismissed from the army for obesity since 2002.

One senior officer blamed poor diet for the obesity levels and said overweight servicemen and women could be found up and down the country.

He told The Sunday Times: ‘Part of the problem is the appalling diet many soldiers have.

‘While soldiers can have salads and low-calorie meals, they can also have a cooked breakfast, followed by chips at lunch and chips at dinner and a stodgy pudding too.’

Mo Ahmed, 32, a former serviceman who is now the owner and founder of Army Boot Camp Fitness, said all those who serve in the army should be able to complete the physical test.

He said: ‘If you stay on top of your fitness you should really be able to pass. If I’m honest, it’s not unbelievably hard.

‘It is average level, you don’t need to be superhuman to complete it.

‘To be a soldier you need to be extremely fit and robust and should be able to deal with any sort of physical challenge.

‘I think a lot more people should be passing it and not failing.’

 'It’s their job to be fit and well to look after our country.'

Mr Ahmed, who also serves as a firefighter for East Sussex Fire and Rescue service, said large amounts of food on offer at army bases could be responsible for some troops letting their fitness levels slide.

He said: ‘There is a big culture of eating in the army.

‘You want to load the calories in for energy levels but that’s all good and well when you’re training lots and staying on top of your fitness but if you’re not doing anything, that’s where the problem lies.

‘It’s definitely an issue.’

The former soldier, who served in the 16 Air Assault Brigade, also said those who serve for the country should want to take pride in their fitness.

He said: ‘On a personal level, I think all of those in our forces should have higher fitness levels including police and firefighters.

‘I find it disappointing to see soldiers who’ve let themselves go and are not taking pride in their fitness.

‘I firmly believe you should look after yourself and keep on top of your fitness levels all of the time.

‘You realise the public might see some soldiers in their beret and uniform, perhaps at a service station or somewhere, and see they’ve let themselves go a little and they will wonder “Is that what the British Army is nowadays?"

‘It’s not good in that sense.’

Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures were ‘worrying’.

He said: ‘It’s their job to be fit and well to look after our country. It’s a necessity.

‘When a group of professional soldiers are being looked after by fitness and nutritional specialists, they really should be able to ensure they are fit and healthy.

‘The inability to do simple fitness test is a worry. It seems to me that it’s one of the most basic parts of their role, the tools of their practice.’

However, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the figures represented only a small number of troops and said training and support was offered to all service personnel.

He said: 'This figure represents 11 per cent of the Army serving in that period and many of those who failed will have subsequently passed their fitness test.

'All personnel are provided with the support and training necessary to meet the Army’s physical standards, with additional help for those personnel who fail to meet this criteria.

'Personnel who remain unable to meet the standard could ultimately be discharged.'
