A Chinese man has offered to 'rent' his girlfriend out to other men so that he can raise money to buy the latest model of iPhone.

Images of Wei Chu, 25, standing outside Songjiang University, Shanghai holding a 'Girlfriend Sharing' advertising board first emerged on Chinese social media earlier this week.

He invited interested passers-by to log on to a nearby wifi network in order to check out images of his 21-year-old girlfriend Xiao Ai, who can be 'rented' for just £1 an hour - although the man insists 'no funny business' can take place on dates he suggests should be focused around dinner or studying

Desperate: Wei Chu apparently offered to rent out his girlfriend in an attempt to fund the purchase of one of Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone 6 handsets.

Business: Aware that potential customers may want to spend various lengths of time with his partner Xiao Ai (pictured), Wei Chu's offer is broken into various pricing categories: £1 an hour, £5 per day and £50 per month.

He was photographed outside Songjiang University as crowds of interested men gathered around.

Seemingly aware that potential customers may want to spend various lengths of time with his partner, Wei Chu's offer is broken into various pricing categories: £1 an hour, £5 per day and £50 per month.

According to posters on Weibo, he claimed his girlfriend was a willing participant in the scheme, which was advertised online under the slogan: 'Sharing girlfriend for pocket money.'

Alongside the new keyboards, messaging tools and photo features of iOS 8, Apple has also updated the software's security features.

In an open letter to customers, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook announced the firm has changed the way encryption works in iOS 8.

As a result the company can no longer bypass a user’s passcode, making it impossible for it to hand over data to law enforcement officers and governments.

This is the case, even if a search warrant is served on the firm or customer.

These new rules, however, only apply to data stored on the device, locked by a passcode, and Apple will be able to access data stored on iCloud if presented with a warrant for it.

And because these new features only apply to iOS 8, data can be extracted where necessary on devices running older versions of the software, from iOS 4 to iOS 7, as has always been the case. 

Individuals interested in taking up the offer were given a short biography of the man's girlfriend, including details on her height, weight and hobbies.

Wei Chu also made clear that the offer was in no way a sexual way - explaining that customers would be given the option to take his girlfriend on dinner or study dates.

'Service items include but are not restricted to: eating together, studying together, saving seats (in libraries/classrooms), three-person dates. Fees generated during dates should be split,' his placard read. 

Wei Chu's unorthodox entrepreneurship is just one extreme method of raising money to pay for the latest iPhone installment.

Earlier this week, a Saudi Arabian man asked his future brother-in-law for an iPhone 6 as a dowry for marrying his sister, according to the International Business Times. 

Meanwhile, following the launch of the iPhone 5 last year, a Chinese couple were charged with human trafficking after admitting selling three of their newborn babies for £8,000 between 2008 and 2013 in order to pay for luxury items including an iPhone.
