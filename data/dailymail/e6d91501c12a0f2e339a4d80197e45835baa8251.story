A 17-year-old West Virginia girl was sentenced Wednesday for helping her friend stab and bury their high school classmate in the woods in 2012 as part of a teenage murder plot that captivated the nation with its ice cold senselessness.

While Rachel Shoaf asked the court for its forgiveness just before she was handed 30 years in state prison, her chilling admission that they'd done it 'because they didn't want to be friends with Skylar anymore' still resonate, especially with Skylar Neese's father.

'She’s not sorry—she’s sorry she got caught,' said a shaken Dave Neese following the case's second, and last, sentencing. 'That’s the only thing she’s sorry for.'

Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to murdering her friend Skylar Neese in July 2012 for no apparent reason other than she didn't want to be friends with her anymore. She was sentenced to 30 years in March (pictured)

'Absolutely not': The victim's father Dave Neese did not offer forgiveness and said 'she¿s sorry she got caught. That¿s the only thing she¿s sorry for'

'She¿s not going to get out when she goes up for (parole) anyway': Dave Neese said he was hoping for a 40 year sentence but wasn't concerned when the judge gave Shoaf (pictured) 30 years

Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood.

Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in January to life as part of a plea agreement that makes her eligible for parole after 15 years.

Shoaf pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder in the July 2012 slaying. She'll be eligible for parole after 10 years.

Dave Neese told wvmetronews.com that he and his family had been hoping for a 40-year sentence but said ten years wasn't going to make much of a difference.

'She’s not going to get out when she goes up for (parole) anyway,' he declared.

At Neese's side was Monongalia County Prosecutor Marcia Ashdown, who believed justice has been done.

'I feel satisfied that we were able to accomplish a reasonable amount of justice for both of these girls. I feel satisfied that Dave and Mary (Neese) did not have to face the ordeal of a trial.'

Before she was sentenced, Skylar's 
father, Dave Neese, addressed the court, saying he was 'speaking on 
behalf of my daughter because she can’t be here'.

'We
 are no longer a family. You can see the faces of the killer, but you 
can’t see Skylar’s face. You can’t imagine how Mary and I now feel,' Mr 
Neese said, according to WV Metro News.

'The person sitting before you, Skylar's so called friend, took her away from us without any remorse or feelings,'

Prosecutors said the pair plotted to kill their friend, Skylar, but a motive for the brutal murder has never been revealed.

The nearest explanation came from Shoaf, who allegedly told police the girls no longer wanted to be friends with Skylar.

Eddy refused to address the court other than to say guilty. Neese's father later said he found her silence 'unacceptable'.

Her lawyer said it wasn't a signal of any lack of remorse.

Michael Benninger said both Eddy and her family are 'eternally sorry'. according to the observer-reporter.

Prosecutors claimed Eddy and Shoaf 
lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and drove her 
to a secluded spot near the unincorporated West Virginia community of 
Macdale.

They said the girls then stabbed her to death at an agreed-upon moment.

Authorities
 said the girls covered the body of the University High honors student 
with branches when they couldn't bury her, and left it in a wooded area 
across the Pennsylvania border for months.

The
 break in the case came in January last year, prosecutors said, when 
Shoaf finally cracked and told investigators what had happened and where
 to find the body.

Speaking
 at Eddy's sentencing, Skylar's family revealed how their daughter's 
friend had comforted them and joined in their grief to try and cover her
 tracks.

Skylar's aunt
 Carol Michaud said: 'She came and acted as if she knew nothing. She 
pretended and stayed with us and comforted us and swore she had no idea 
what was going.To come to this day and admit she did just shows how evil
 she can be.'

Though Eddy's name was no secret in 
the community, authorities didn't make it public until September, when 
they transferred her case from juvenile to adult court.

Skylar was initially considered a runaway and no Amber Alert was issued to publicly notify people of her disappearance.

Last
 year, the Legislature tweaked the state's Amber Alert process that had 
limited it to cases where a child is believed to be abducted.

The
 revised law requires law enforcement to relay initial reports of any 
missing child to state police, regardless if the person is a runaway. 
Amber Alert personnel would then decide whether or not to issue an 
alert.
