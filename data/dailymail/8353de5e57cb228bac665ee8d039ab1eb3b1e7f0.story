If they gave out a gong for Britain’s most hard-working  and public-spirited young  man, David Day would surely be a shoo-in.

For at the age of 21 – and at a time when there are more than a million youngsters not in work, college or training – Mr Day divides his time between an astonishing 11 jobs.

Determined to help his community, he juggles five paid jobs with six volunteer roles, and sometimes works as many as 60 hours a week.

Many guises: David Day spends five hours a week as a badminton coach (left) at Mapperley Sports Village and another hour and a half volunteering for St John Ambulance (right)

His paid jobs are as a shop assistant at Primark, a steward at Notts County Football Club, a lunchtime attendant at a junior school, and two roles at after-school clubs, all of which take up 40 hours of his week.

And yet he still finds time to volunteer at a youth group and a children’s play centre, coaches badminton and football, volunteers for St John Ambulance and teaches life-saving.And all for a weekly wage of up to just £262.

Mr Day, from Carlton, Nottingham, said: ‘I often lose count of how many hours I do. You just don’t bother counting any more.

‘I’m just moving from one job to the next, but I’m used to the way I organise my time.

‘I would much rather be doing something useful than sitting in front of the TV. It’s nice to have money, but I don’t care about it. To help people and do something I enjoy means much more.’

Mr Day, who has been volunteering since he was ten, said more people his age should give it a go.He added: ‘There’s a perception that young people won’t do anything for nothing, but there are people my age out there who want to help others. It’s just nice to help people out.

‘I would like to see more volunteers and show people how to get involved and how good it feels to help people and see how they react.’

Mr Day’s selflessness and work ethic set an example to others, according to colleagues and local officials.

George Cowcher, chief executive of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce, said: ‘Young people often get a bad press and there are  stereotypes that are unhelpful and can put them at a disadvantage in the eyes of potential employers.

‘But David just goes to show that there are some talented, driven and creative young people who would be an asset to any business.’

Leslie Rhodes, from Gedling Play Forum children’s group, added: ‘David puts himself out for anyone. He works as much as he can for us.

‘When a trip for disabled kids was short of a first-aider, without any notice David jumped on the bus.’ Graham Atkin, president of Mapperley Park Badminton Club, where Mr Day coaches junior sessions, said: ‘David’s a great role model for our young players.’

The number of young adults aged 16 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training has fallen by 1.3 per cent in a year to 1.09million.
