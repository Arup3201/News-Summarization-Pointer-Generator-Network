Paul Lambert has insisted there is ‘no chance’ of Fabian Delph or Ron Vlaar leaving Aston Villa in the January transfer window.

Even though Delph and Vlaar could leave for free next summer, Lambert is adamant no amount of money will tempt him — and he will have the final say.

Delph has interested Tottenham and Liverpool while Manchester United and Arsenal have been linked with Vlaar.

‘They’ll not go anywhere in January,’ said Lambert. ‘It’s my say. The way January works, if somebody’s worth something you may as well put another 15 zeroes on the end of it. Price is inflated. 

Even if anybody came in you would never let them go cheap or anything like that.’ Asked if any sum could prise either player away, the Villa manager said: ‘Nothing, no.’

Lambert dismissed speculation of a swap deal for Delph with Tottenham’s Moussa Dembele and appeared to give hope new Villa deals for two of his best players could still be possible.

‘I’m pretty sure those talks will keep on going,’ said Lambert.

‘Those lads have been great.’
