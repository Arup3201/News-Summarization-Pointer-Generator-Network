An aspiring model whose 36DD taxpayer-funded breasts sparked public anger has criticised a woman for having a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS.

Josie Cunningham, 23, fuelled public anger when she had £4,800 worth of breast 
enlargement surgery on the NHS in January after complaining she had been
 bullied over her ‘flat’ 32A chest.

But despite the controversy her own treatment caused, she has now criticised single mother and  aspiring actress Kelly McManus who had a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS – because she wanted a better love life.

Speaking to The Sun, Miss Cunningham said: 'This is an incredible waste of taxpayers' money. Thousands of mothers have the same problem after childbirth. Kelly should have just worked harder at losing her baby bump naturally.'

Miss McManus said she lost her confidence after having three children and was embarrassed to show her ‘mummy tummy’ to men.

She also wanted the surgery to increase her chances of pursuing an  acting career because she wants to be the next Julia Roberts.

But the part-time beautician, who  earns £7,000 a year, could not afford the procedure and pleaded with doctors to help her get rid of her bulge.

After 18 months of visiting her GP, she was referred to a surgeon for the taxpayer-funded operation.

Miss McManus, who once appeared on ITV’s Jeremy Kyle show, said: ‘What people need to understand is that it has been really hard for me.

‘I constantly looked pregnant and it was affecting my social life. I had no confidence when I went out with my friends.

'But one of the worst things was that I felt embarrassed when I took my clothes off in front of men and so it affected my sex life and I’d just had enough.

‘The new tummy makes me feel a lot more attractive and I have already been out with friends and my sex life is also slowly improving. It is great.

‘And if it helps my career as an actress, something I’ve always wanted, then I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. It has changed my life and I’m not going to say sorry for that.’

The 27-year-old believes the operation has saved the NHS money in the long term, claiming it would have cost more money to treat her for depression.

She said: ‘After my first child my stomach never went back to its normal size.

‘Then after my third child I began to suffer from a condition where my stomach muscles had separated from my bulge.

‘It had started making me feel really down and I’m not going to apologise for getting it done.’ But campaigners were outraged at the decision to fund the operation when cuts are being made elsewhere in the NHS.

A spokesman for The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s ridiculous that the NHS pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs.

‘Patients missing out on vital drugs and treatment will find this deeply unfair.’

However, Miss McManus hit back at her critics, saying she deserved the operation and would urge other woman to follow the same path.

She said: ‘I only did it after I became desperate and  knew that I wouldn’t be able to afford it. 

‘I hated feeling depressed  and now I’m a lot happier  and can go out more without feeling self-conscious. 

‘I don’t make the decisions about who does and does  not get surgery – that’s up  to the doctors. So it’s not  my fault if people with other conditions are not getting treated properly.

‘I would tell other women  to go for it because there is  no point feeling down about stuff and you can get it sorted on the NHS.’

At first doctors recommended physiotherapy and exercise for Miss McManus to improve the appearance of her stomach but she claims it did not work.

Eventually, she was referred to a surgeon. The three-hour operation to remove the excess skin on her abdomen was carried out at Bradford Royal Infirmary last month.

She said: ‘It’s only been a few weeks but I feel great and my friends have said the same. It’s a great confidence boost.’

In another case earlier this year, Josie Cunningham, 23, told how she had £4,800 worth of breast enlargement surgery on the NHS in January after complaining she had been bullied over her ‘flat’ 32A chest.

But after undergoing the operation, the aspiring model from Leeds said her 36DD breasts had made her the target of online abuse.

Miss Cunningham then said she would like a reduction and compensation.

She claimed she was not properly consulted before the operation and wanted compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress.

Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, consulted no-win, no-fee lawyers so she can ‘take [theNHS] for every penny’.
