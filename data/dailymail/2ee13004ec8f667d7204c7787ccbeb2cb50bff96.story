He was put on the Liverpool Care Pathway and had his food and fluids  removed for several days

A woman has spoken of her heartbreak after her father died - she believes after being put on Liverpool Care Pathway.

Arthur Oszek, 86, was admitted to Ayr General Hospital hospital after a fall.

But for several days Mr Oszek, a diabetic, had his food, drink and some of his medication removed, his stepdaughter claims.

Ann Murdoch was told her father had been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway in a bid to let his body focus on medication to make his final days as comfortable as possible.

But Ms Murdoch, 65, was furious that doctors hadn't asked for permission to put him on the pathway and demanded he be taken off it.

After 20 hours of discussions, doctors agreed to restore his food and drink.

But by then it was too late and his body gave up the fight, his feet turning back.

He died just 17 hours later on August 25 last year.

Ms Murdoch said it took her months to come to terms with her father's loss and 
it was only when she heard of similar cases where people were put on the
 Liverpool Care Pathway without consent that she felt she couldn't hold 
back her anger any more.

Last month a major review was announced into the Liverpool Care Pathway, by the Association for Palliative Medicine.

The group, which represents 1,000 doctors who work in hospices and specialist hospital wards, will 'identify and explore concerns' over the system of caring for patients in their final days.

The review comes as several families have said their loved ones were put on the pathway without their consent.

Speaking from her home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Ms Murdoch claimed NHS doctors had robbed her father's right to live.

Mr Oszek's daughter Ann Murdoch (right) said her father had begged for water and his cracked lips showed he was severely dehydrated

The retired shop manageress said: 'It was dreadful, he was taken into the hospital because he had a couple of falls and at first he was put on the drip.

'But then after a number of days he was suddenly taken off it and he was just begging for a drink, saying "I'm so thirsty".'

'We asked the doctors why he was taken off his drip and we were told he was on the Liverpool Care Pathway.

'We didn't even know what is was, there's no way that should have happened without asking us.

'We kicked up a fuss and demanded he be put back on his medication, and eventually they agreed about 20 hours later.'

But Mr Oszek, a former miner, died within 24 hours as his body was unable to recover from his frail state, his family claim.

Although the great-great-grandfather-of-one was surrounded by Ms Murdoch and his other daughter Helena when he passed away, it was an uncomfortable end to his life, they say.

Ms Murdoch added: 'He was left dying there for 17 hours until the inevitable happened. No one should have to see their loved one needlessly die like that in front of them.

'You wouldn't even make a dog die like that, he was just left to die on his own - none of the doctors came in to check on his condition, in the end we were dabbing a damp cloth over his cracked lips.

'My granddaughter had a camera with her and she took a few photos of him when his feet turned black - it was so distressing.'

After 20 hours of discussions with the family, doctors agreed to restore Mr Oszek's drip, but his feet began to turn black and he died shortly afterwards

She said: 'Our dad wanted to live, the nurse even said "you want to live, don't you Arthur", but the doctors denied him that right.

'We don't want anyone else to suffer what we have suffered. My father was a character and a very caring person, he looked after my mother in her final years when she had cancer - he didn't deserve what happened to him.

'He was on a lot of medication, but he was living at home, he was able to look after himself with the aid of a care worker from the council.

'He was fully aware of what was going on around him and he was happy. He should have lived a lot longer.'

Mandy Yule, Director of Integrated Care and Partner Services at NHS Ayrshire and Arran said although they could not comment Mr Oszek's case until an official complaint was received from his family, she insisted they always consult families before proceeding with the Liverpool Care Pathway.

She said: 'The Liverpool Care Pathway is an end-of-life care plan to ensure that patients in the last few days of life receive the quality of care needed.

'The patient's condition is continually monitored in order to assess the patient's needs and to provide support to their relatives or carers.

'Communication with patients and their families is central to end-of-life care. The Liverpool Care Pathway does not preclude the use of clinically assisted (artificial) hydration or nutrition and all clinical decisions are made with the patient's best interest and comfort in mind.'

A former version of the article described the Liverpool Care Pathway as “a withdrawal of food and fluids”. We are happy to make clear that the LCP is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment and the needless prolonging of life. Once a patient is no longer able to eat or drink, consideration is given as to whether fluids and nutrients should continue to be provided.
