The official music charts will include songs that are streamed on services such as Spotify for the first time next month.

As increasing numbers of music listeners choose to play songs online instead of buy physical or digital copies, the Official Charts Company has been forced to change the way it calculates our favourite tracks.

From July 6, songs that are played through on-demand services, which also include sites such as Deezer and Napster, will feature in the charts, which are announced on Radio 1 each week.

The change could mean new bands find themselves at the top of the charts for the first time.

The song Pompeii, by British rock band Bastille, reached number two in the UK charts last year. But it is also the UK’s most streamed track of all time, with more than 26million plays.

The Official Charts Company will weight streaming to that 100 plays amount to one physical sale.

So far this year the average weekly figures volume of streaming is 70 times greater than the combined sales of downloads and physical singles.

Online listening: Chart-topping hit Get Lucky by Daft Punk (pictured) was the first song to generate a million streams in a week

With some of the services offering free ad-funded accounts, it marks the first time that chart positions could be affected without music fans actually making a purchase.

The move - which has been backed by the music industry - reflects the explosion in streaming which has occurred in recent months with audio streams rising from around 100million a week in January of last year to 200million at the start of this year.

It has continued to rocket and peaked at 268million during one week.

On average the number of weekly streams for 2014 is currently at 228million, while the level of single sales trails significantly at 3.2million.

Chart-topping hit Get Lucky by Daft Punk was the first to generate a million plays in a week but with the ongoing rise, there have already been nine songs this year which have run into seven figures in a week.

To qualify, songs must be streamed for a minimum of 30 seconds and there will be controls in place to stop users playing songs too many times in order to manipulate the chart.

Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot said: ‘Audio streaming has grown at an extraordinary rate over the past year - and the time is now right to take this important step.

‘The Official Singles Chart is, and always has been, the most trusted and definitive measure of Britain’s music tastes.

Just as it has evolved through the years to reflect the most popular music in the UK, from 10-inch to 7-inch, vinyl to cassettes, CD singles to downloads, this is the latest stage of that progression.’

George Ergatoudis, head of music at BBC Radio 1 which broadcasts the top 40 each Sunday, said: ‘We are moving from an era of music purchasing to one dominated by music streaming and it is vital that the Official Singles Chart evolves to reflect this.’

The official chart has been run since 1969.
