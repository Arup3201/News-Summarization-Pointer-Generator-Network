With their wrinkly-faces, soulful eyes and curly little tails, pugs are one of the cutest and most lovable breed of dogs around.

And they just got even cuter thanks to a charming new book which sees a host of the tiny canines dressed up in adorable outfits. 

Recognise this wrecking ball? A  new book called Pugs in Costumes sees a host of pugs dressed up in hilarious outfits like this one inspired by the racy Miley Cyrus music video

Pugs in Costumes is described as a collection of the best-dressed pugs around. 

The £7.99 book is divided into sections including 'Puggywood', featuring the dogs dressed as Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Pugroe, Elvis Pugsley, Gandalf the grey pug and Christina Pugliera, and 'Pugoween' showing the furry friends dressed in Halloween costumes.

The introduction to the book reads: 'From haute couture Oscar de la Renta dresses and character classics, to inanimate objects, there isn't a creature on earth that can rock a costume quite like a pug.' We couldn't agree more.

The woof of wall street: The £7.99 book also includes Wall Street Pug, based on Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the Hollywood blockbuster

Blonde ambition: This pooch sports a wig and white gown inspired by the late Hollywood starlet, Marilyn Monroe and even has her favourite Chanel No. 5 perfume to hand to keep her smelling fresh

Waiting for her prince? This little black pup emulates popular Disney character Rapunzel

Welcome to middle earth: This noble pug sits nonchalantly in a field impersonating Gandalf from Lord of the Rings 

Remember when? Hundreds of wrinkly-faced pets and devoted owners celebrated the UK's first pugfest- and there was even a VIP (very important pugs) area
800 people were at Court Colman Manor in Bridgend
