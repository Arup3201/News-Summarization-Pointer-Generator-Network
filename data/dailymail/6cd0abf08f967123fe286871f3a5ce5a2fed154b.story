The ball Rory McIlroy used to clinch the British Open title and then threw into the gallery after the 72nd hole at Hoylake has already attracted bids in excess of US$5,500 (£3,247) after being put up for sale.

Golf auction house Green Jacket jumped at the chance to find out what such a memento was worth after McIlroy's impressive two-shot victory, and put a callout on Twitter to find the man who caught it.

Lee Horner, of Leeds, was that very man who was in the stands when the winning ball found its way into his hands.

'When Rory
 threw the ball, it hit me in the hand and then fell down,' Horner told 
ESPN.com. 'There was a kerfuffle, but I managed to get it and hold it in
 the air and the crowd went crazy.'

Green
 Jacket offered £10,000 for the ball on social media but Horner has kept
 it for himself, with Green Jacket due to make a 15 per cent commission 
on the final price.

It
 could be a lucrative venture with the 20th recorded bid on Tuesday of 
US$5,558 (£3.280), up from a July 26 starting price of £1,000.

confirm its authenticity.
