A one-word insult helped provoke the TV punch that landed media tycoon Alexander Lebedev in the dock, a court was told yesterday.

It was delivered in the ‘green room’ before the talk show, when property mogul Sergei Polonsky is said to have called Lebedev a ‘mudak’, a Russian word which translates as ‘d***head’.

Lebedev, whose family control the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, faces up to five years jail if he is found to have punched the businessman because of ‘political hatred’.

Footage of the 2011 punch went viral 
on the internet and the trial is taking place amid claims the Kremlin 
wants Lebedev jailed as revenge for his Russian newspaper Novaya 
Gazeta’s investigations highlighting corruption in high places.

Russian journalist Olga Romanova, a 
witness, pleaded with the court not to have to repeat the ‘rude’ word 
allegedly uttered by Polonsky, but was ordered to do so.

She said that as the show got under  way, shortly before the punch, Polonsky berated Ledebev for several minutes off microphone.

‘He behaved in a provocative way, but it is his style, he is always provocative,’ she said.

Emotions: A witness in the audience during the show told the court that Mr Polonsky had been acting 'emotionally' before Mr Lebedev hit him

Viral: Footage of the punch, when Polonsky fell backwards and was knocked off his chair, went viral on the internet

‘Polonsky was saying something to Lebedev all the time, two or three minutes long, talking but not into the microphone.

‘I did not hear it, I was far enough away, but it was disturbing. I can’t remember Lebedev answering this.’

Soon afterwards, she saw Lebedev’s back as he hit Polonsky.

Anton Krasovski, presenter of the 
Russian talk show, did not confirm the attack by Lebedev, 53, was 
motivated by ‘political hatred’, a key requirement under Russian law if 
Levedev is to be sentenced to jail over the incident. ‘I did see Lebedev
hitting Polonsky, but I have no idea why he did it,’ he said.

‘I can’t remember what Polonsky 
actually said, but I watched it again and I remember there was a series 
of provocative remarks by this extravagant person Polonsky.’

Charge:
During the televised show Sergei Polonsky, a Russian businessman, pictured, allegedly called Lebedev a 'mudak', which translates as 'd***head'

Krasovski insisted: ‘It was not political. I don’t think so.’

Polonsky has not appeared at the trial in Moscow.

His lawyers said he is in Cambodia – 
where he was bailed from detention pending an investigation into claims 
he assaulted and kidnapped local sailors at knifepoint – though there 
are other claims he is in Israel.

Lebedev’s legal team demanded the court be told where he is and why he can’t attend proceedings.

After yesterday’s hearing, Lebedev 
said that in 2006, when he was a Russian MP, he signed a request for an 
official investigation into a Polonsky construction project.

‘It was just my duty but Polonsky probably took it personally and cannot forgive me,’ he said.

‘We had never met before seeing each other in the dressing room before the show.

‘He was provocative and rude but nobody saw it. The investigators studied only the 45 minutes of the show.’

The trial resumes today.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
