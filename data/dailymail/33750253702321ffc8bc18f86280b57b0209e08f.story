This is the terrifying moment a gang of hammer wielding robbers dressed in boiler suits smashed their way into a jewellers during a raid in broad daylight.

CCTV footage shows two hooded men running to the front of the store before unleashing a barrage of blows at the store front in an attempt to break their way in.

Behind them a third person wearing a black hooded jacket and black gloves can be seen clapping them in encouragement. 

Within just 25 seconds the trio of thugs make their escape with £600 worth of jewellery they managed to swipe from the shop window.

Raid: Two robbers dressed in blue boiler suits and armed with hammers can be seen on CCTV running towards Ashoka Jewellers in Wolverhampton

Violent: The robbers repeatedly smashed the windows of the jewellery store while the owner hid in a back room with a customer

The raid was captured by security cameras outside the Ashoka Jewellers in Wolverhampton at around 12.45pm on Tuesday.

Police are now appealing for witnesses to the brazen robbery after the balaclava-clad gang escaped with their loot of silver bangles and rings.

Store owner Ashock Khurmi, 57, today told how he and a customer were forced to hide in a back room as the men emptied the entire contents of the shop front window display.

He said: 'It was a terrible shock, the whole thing was absolutely terrifying. I was talking to a customer at the front desk when I heard a loud bang.

'I quickly went into the back room with the customer and we locked the door and watched the CCTV screen.

Attack: The brazen thieves targeted the store in the middle of the day around 12.45pm on Tuesday

'It was incredible, everything was over in just a few seconds. It makes me feel like closing down for good.

'I couldn’t sleep last night because I am worried that this sort of thing could happen again in the future.

'I feel in constant danger in this area and I am asking myself whether it is worth taking the risk just to try and make a living.

'I have had this shop since 1989, but the crime has got out of control in the last few years.

'It has got so bad that I no longer display any of the valuable jewellery in the front window of the shop because I fear that someone will try and steal it.'
