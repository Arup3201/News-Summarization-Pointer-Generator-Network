A Greek restaurant faces losing its licence after locals reported being woken up to the sound of loud bouzouki music and smashing plates.

Bosses of the Mythopolis restaurant have been ordered to attend a licensing hearing at Islington Council today after repeated complaints about noise.

The eatery, in Islington, north London, had been granted a late licence to serve alcohol and play live music until 3.30am, but a stream of complaints led to council chiefs confiscating music equipment last week.

Officers seized thousands of pounds worth of music gear, which has been impounded before the hearing when licensing chiefs decide on whether to withdraw the restaurant’s licence.

Neighbours reported hearing ‘very loud’ traditional Greek music - played on a bouzouki - blaring until 3.30am and complained it was stopping them sleeping.

Locals living near the restaurant also said that other noise included loud singing, smashing plates - a traditional Greek folk custom during celebrations such as weddings, birthdays and parties - and shouting.

The restaurant is hailed as one of London’s only ‘Greek pop music’ venues and regularly hosts sessions played by performers from Cyprus and Greece.

One local who complained to the council by letter but was not named said: 'The noise is an issue during the week where live music is played at an unacceptable noise level at unacceptable times. 

'I must wake up early in the morning to go to work and find it hard to function due to lack of sleep.'

Another local, who asked not to be named, said: 'The music is the main issue, but there is also a problem with people standing around smoking and singing and shouting outside the restaurant.

'People have also heard plates being smashed, but I suppose that could just be kitchen staff dropping them by accident.'

Owner Stephanos Makis said recently that he did not want ‘problems with the neighbours’, adding: 'We don’t have any fights, we don’t have any drugs. 

'We do make mistakes but I think it’s the only Greek place in the Islington area.'

Bosses at the restaurant have previously pledged to soundproof the restaurant but it will be up to councillors today as to whether to restrict the opening times of the venue or close it down completely.
