Experience has made a wise old bird out of Mark Ramprakash – and he plans to take his charges under his wing in his new role as England’s batting coach.

To those who fear for Alastair Cook and Co being tutored by a man whose introspective tendencies contributed to a scandalously below-par Test batting average of 27, Ramprakash himself has an honest riposte: ‘If I’d known then what I know now, it would have been great.’

Eight years after being ditched for good by the selectors following a tricky tour of New Zealand in early 2002, Ramprakash was still churning out the hundreds for Surrey. The elegant cover-drive remained intact. But he had learned a thing or two about mental strength.

Now, named as Graham Gooch’s successor until next September, he has the chance to pass it on: here, the ECB are hoping, beginneth the lesson.

‘People ask me whether I shouldn’t have done better in my international career,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I tell them I can sleep at night because I tried my hardest.

‘Could I have been more self-aware? Yes, definitely. Did I learn more after I passed 30? Yes, definitely. If I’d known then what I know now, it would have been great.

‘I’ve had 25 years in the game, so there’s a lot of experience to draw on – both good and bad. It’s very important to understand the stresses and strains that go on at international level, the importance of confidence and self-belief, and how fragile they can be.

‘I’ll try to empathise with the players. If I see someone struggling or withdrawing or over-thinking – that’s when I can help.’

Ramprakash, 45, observed the process at first hand over the summer as Cook appeared at times to be doing battle as much with himself as with the Sri Lankan and Indian bowlers.

‘I was struck by the relentless, sustained criticism of the England captain,’ said Ramprakash, who took on a more hands-on role after England’s batsmen surrendered to Ishant Sharma’s bouncers during the second Test against India at Lord’s.

‘The demands are huge on a captain these days. Alastair has to do three interviews after the toss, then 10 minutes later he’s strapping on his pads to open the batting for England.

‘If you start to struggle with your game in those circumstances, it can be hugely challenging. He showed tremendous strength of character to make that 95 at Southampton.’

It was the kind of knock you suspect Ramprakash wishes he had been able to summon up more often during his own international career: gritty, unself-conscious, indifferent to whether he had just been beaten outside off. And it is the mental side of the game he will be working on now.

‘When people talk about me as a player, they often think of the technical side,’ he said. ‘But at this level you hope the techniques of the players are pretty good already. It’s more a question of what’s going on between the ears. It’s helping players to feel confident, reinforcing their beliefs, evolving their game, provoking thought.’

Ramprakash already has one foot in the door. Even before he worked part-time with the England team over the summer, he had coached his old club Middlesex and worked with the Lions. Batsmen such as Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali are used to his methods: ‘They’re a very talented group.’

But his first full-time role will be to help prepare England for next year’s World Cup. It’s been nearly 23 years since they last mounted a credible tilt at the title, and expectations are not high.

Ramprakash is congratulated by Darren Gough after scoring his 100th first-class hundred in 2008

‘It’s fair to say England are a wildcard,’ said Ramprakash. ‘We want to try to take pressure off the players, and if they feel they’re underdogs, that’s fine. I’ve seen when playing against teams with nothing to lose that it can really free you up. I think that no-fear attitude is the way to go.

‘Someone like Alex Hales looks comfortable and clear with his Nottinghamshire shirt on. I want to encourage him to find that clarity whenever he has an England shirt on too.’

And no one can say Ramprakash hasn’t reached his own clarity the hard way.
