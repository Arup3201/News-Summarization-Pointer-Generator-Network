It's no secret that portion sizes in America are some of the largest, and it appears this is also true when it comes to fast food chains.

According to a video on BuzzFeed, even McDonald's cup sizes are larger in the U.S. than elsewhere - except for in Singapore and Canada, which also go by the same definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large'.

In fact, a medium-sized drink in the U.S., which is 21oz of liquid, is an ounce more than Japan's large-sized drink.

Portion control: McDonald's cup sizes are larger in the U.S. than elsewhere - except for in Singapore and Canada, which also go by the same definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large'

And America's large size (30oz) is 1.5 times bigger than the one in Japan (20oz).

The video begins by showing the sizes of cups in America, marking the 16oz small, 21oz medium and 30oz large with white lines on a red background.

Sizes in other countries are then placed against the lines to see how they measure up. 

In Australia, a small beverage from McDonald's is just about the same size as a small from the U.S., but a medium-sized one is significantly shorter - just minimally bigger than Australia's small.

Super size it: America's large size (30oz) is 1.5 times bigger than the one in Japan (20oz)

Comparison: A medium-sized drink in the U.S., which is 21oz of liquid, is big enough to overflow Japan's 20oz large cup

And a large is nearly as big as the one in America, although not quite.

In Hong Kong, the sizes are nearly exactly the same as they are in Australia. 

But in the UK, the small-sized cup appears several ounces smaller than the one in the U.S., and slightly smaller than the smalls in Australia and Hong Kong.

America may win the prize for largest sodas, but it's a triumph that doesn't come without controversy. 

Drink up: In Hong Kong, a small beverage from McDonald's is just about the same size as one from the U.S., but a medium-sized one is significantly shorter - just minimally bigger than the Hong Kong small

Side by side: Australian McDonald's have almost exactly the same sizes as those in Hong Kong 

Miniature: In the UK, the small-sized cup appears several ounces smaller than the one in the U.S. A medium in the UK looks about the same size as a small in the U.S.

Indeed, in 2012, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg attempted to implement a soda ban to stop New Yorkers from consuming large sugary drinks, and therefore fight rising obesity rates.

The proposed law would ban restaurants, theaters and food courts from selling sugary drinks and sodas larger than 16oz.

The law was eventually overturned in court, but current Mayor Bill deBlasio has recently revealed that he is determined to take up where his predecessor left off in regards to a big soda ban.
