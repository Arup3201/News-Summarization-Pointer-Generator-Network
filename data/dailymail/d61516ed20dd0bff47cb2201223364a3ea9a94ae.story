A real life Breaking Bad father of three started a cannabis factory to support his family after losing his home and livelihood following a tumour operation.

Shane Cousins, a 40-year-old father of three, was hoping to copy US crime drama chemistry teacher Walter White, who builds a Class A drug crystal meth empire after he is diagnosed with cancer.

However Cousins, who had been forced to leave the car-valeting business he part-owned when an operation to remove a golf-ball sized lump in his neck left him unable to work, didn't have a clue about cannabis.

The former glass factory worker, who lives in the small former coal-mining town of Ystradgynlais in South Wales with children Kyla, six, Keira, 11, Ethan, 16, and wife Julia, didn't even know how he was going to sell his crop.

Shane Cousins (pictured), said his debt had spiralled to £50,000 when he started the drugs venture

'I didn't even know whether it was ready,' he said. 'It was not something I had ever done before. I was going on the net to see when it was ready and I was just playing it by ear.'

He added: 'I don't like the stuff. I've never smoked. I don't smoke fags or anything. Apparently that went against me in court. If I smoked it I could have said it was for personal use.'

He pleaded guilty in Brecon Magistrates' Court last week - and faces sentence on October 10 after police found 23 plants in the property.

Cousins was caught when a friend rang police in front of him after an argument.  'I don't why he did it,' he said. 'It was spur of the moment and he was sorry after.' 

At the time, his debt had spiralled to £50,000 and he was hoping to make thousands from the drugs venture.

His life had fallen apart after his operation, which left him unable to work.

'The lump turned out to be benign,' he said. 'But I had to have an operation that lasted seven or eight hours to have it removed. I still cannot feel part of my neck because it went so deep.

'I never went back to work because I was recovering from that. At the time I had a mortgage and everything was great.'

By 2008 he had lost his home in Seven Sisters, Neath Port Talbot - which was valued at about £80,000 - and later moved to Abercraf, near Ystradgynlais.

He had only initially been to the doctors to get medication for his sinuses.

'The doctor said to me: "What is that lump on your neck?'' Cousins said. 'It was by my ear, on the side of my neck by my ear. On the side of my cheek basically.

'I said I had been there twice and had been told there was nothing wrong with it. But it had grown in size.'

He then began growing his cannabis from seeds he bought over the internet.

'I paid £50 for the tents and the lights were about £50 each. It cost me about £250 in total. I borrowed that off a mate. It must have been going on for about three or four months.

'There must have been about three or four weeks (to go) until they were ready.'

The former glass factory worker was inspired by Channel 5 cop show Police Interceptors and when officers raided his home, they were overwhelmed by the smell.

'I managed to get five or six in the car,' he said. 'As I walked downstairs the police were there at the front and the back. I went back in the bedroom and didn't answer the door.

'They found the plants in the bedroom and the attic and the six in the car. They could have seized the car. I had to get everything out and put it all in the police vans.

'There were 23 in total. Fifteen in the attic, two in the bedroom and six in the car.'

His wife was terrified after hearing what had happened.

He said: 'We have been together for 16 years. She was in bits because she was in work at the time it happened. She said, "Oh my God, we could lose the kids!"

'The solicitor said they will not jail me under the circumstances because I've no previous at all for anything. He thought it would be a suspended sentence for a year or community service or a fine or whatever.

'Not seeing my kids and the rest of the family - I don't know how I would cope. It would be difficult.'

Cousins now insisted his criminal career was over.

'I would never do this again,' he said. 'Never, never. No way in the whole wide world. The thing is, how many other people are out there in my position, with no money and on the edge of doing something like this? 

'Or if they have got to take two or three jobs to survive and they have got debt collectors on the door,' Shane said. 'How many people are doing this and have not been caught?'
