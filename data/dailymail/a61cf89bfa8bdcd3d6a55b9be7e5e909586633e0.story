Bryan Greenhalgh, 63, was handed a discretionary life term after admitting 13 charges of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault

A former headmaster has been jailed for a string of sex attacks on eight vulnerable boys at two boarding schools over a ten year period dating back to the 1970s.

Bryan Greenhalgh, 63, was handed a discretionary life term after admitting 13 charges of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault.

He was told he had to spend at least three years behind bars, and would only be freed if he was rated as low risk, after being branded 'dangerous' by a judge.

Greenhalgh, of Suffield, near North Walsham, Norfolk, was jailed at Norwich Crown Court as one of his old colleagues, Ken Wells, was also sent to jail for historic sex offences.

Greenhalgh carried out the attacks on boys, all aged under 16, at Sheringham Court School, Norfolk, and Thurlby Manor, Lincolnshire.

He was also sentenced for possessing indecent images found on his home computer after it was seized by police.

Andrew Shaw, defending, said Greenhalgh deserved credit for his guilty plea.

Mr Shaw told the court: 'Any sentence should not be so long as to give him no hope of release to enjoy the twilight years of his life. He does not enjoy the best of health.'

Judge Nicholas Coleman labelled Greenhalgh 'a very high risk sex offender.'

He said: 'You cannot understand the untold harm you have done to these boys as they have gone into adulthood.

'It’s clear they have suffered severe psychological harm. You are a dangerous person.'

Wells, 76, of Leicester, was convicted yesterday of three counts of indecent assault following an eight-day trial at Norwich Crown Court.

The housefather abused a boy aged under 16 at Sheringham Court School in the 1970s.

Jailing Wells for six years, Judge Catherine Moore told him: 'You exploited the opportunity to satisfy your own sexual gratification - your duty was to protect the children at the school.

'Your victim has been profoundly affected in his life.'

Last night investigating officer, Detective Constable Tristan Coull, of Norfolk Police child abuse investigation unit, said: 'Greenhalgh’s life sentence clearly shows that he exploited his position as headmaster to win over the trust of the boys in his care and subjected them to horrendous abuse.

'He preyed on boys who were at their most vulnerable and who at the time of the abuse felt unable to speak out as he appeared to be an upstanding pillar of the community.

'Wells in addition abused his position of trust at Sheringham Court and failed in his duty to ensure his victim was safe.

'Through the positions they held, it would have been the most basic of expectations to protect these children - instead they chose to do the complete opposite.'

Detective Inspector Andy Coller, who led the complex inquiry, praised the victims for being brave enough to come forward.

He said: 'It has taken an enormous amount of courage for each victim to talk about the abuse, abuse they have had to live with for decades.

'It is pleasing that the passing of some 40 years has not hindered the legal process and that Greenhalgh and Wells have both been jailed for these crimes.

'Time may make our investigations more complicated, but it will not stop them.

'We will robustly investigate any offences brought to our attention, however old they may be.

'It is to their credit that those boys, now men, have found the strength to speak up after so many years.'
