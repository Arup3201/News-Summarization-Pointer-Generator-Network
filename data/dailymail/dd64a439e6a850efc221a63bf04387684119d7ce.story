AÂ  woman was caught on CCTV attacking her cheating husband's alleged lover before tossing her over a cliff.

The footage from Arequipa, in Peru, shows cheating husband having a heated conversation with his mistress when out of nowhere his wife shows up.

The husband, identified as Renezo Saavedra, 
quickly flees, leaving his enraged wife to have her way with his lover.

Lisset Lupo Mamani is then seen dragging 25-year-old Sandra Bruna 
Morales by her hair toward the edge of a steep depression, The Inquisitr reported.

She then 
pushes Ms Morales off the edge and down a 20ft-high
drop.

A few minutes later, the victim made it 
out of the hole and walked away. She was later admitted to a hospital 
with various lacerations and bruises.

In a later interview the jilted wife said she didn't remember throwing 
the woman off the cliff, only pulling her by the hair, The Inquisitr reported.

She said she was 
overcome with rage and regretted the incident. Meanwhile, she'd 
separated from Saavedra and asked him to provide for their four children but
otherwise leave her alone.

Perhaps sensing there was trouble afoot, the husband immediately fled the scene
