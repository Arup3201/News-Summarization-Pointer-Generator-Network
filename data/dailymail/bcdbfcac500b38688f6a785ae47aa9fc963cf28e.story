Convictions: Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, is expected to rule that forcing workers to disclose minor convictions in all cases is a breach of their human rights

Workers who have committed minor offences should not have to admit their wrongdoing to employers, according a senior judge.

In a landmark case, Lord Dyson is expected to rule that it is unlawful to make job applicants disclose minor crimes that were carried out when they were young.

Despite Home Office concerns that changing the terms of disclosure could cause systematic chaos, the Master of Rolls is expected to say that the current system breaches the right to family and private life under the Human Rights Act.

Under current rules, job applicants do not have to disclose convictions that are 'spent' under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.

But workers still have to disclose all convictions and cautions under a Disclosure and Barring Service check - formerly known as a CRB check.

These certificates are usually requested by employers in certain areas or work, such as healthcare or when dealing with children.

Lord Dyson gave an outline of his ruling in the Appeal Court case of a 21-year-old man, known only as T.

He received warnings from Manchester Police when aged 11 in connection with two stolen bicycles.

The man was forced to disclose the information when applying for a job at a local football club when he was 17 and when applying to university.

The judge said: 'It is extraordinary that 
nothing has been done. The Government needs to pull its finger out and 
introduce legislation.'

Civil right group Liberty, who have been involved in the court case, reiterated that forcing workers to disclose minor offences when applying for jobs later is a breach of their human rights.

Following the ruling, the Government will be forced to address whether they want to comply, alternatively having 28 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.

One option would be to establish a system that removed old or minor convictions that were not followed by prison terms - with an exception for those seeking to work with children.

New approach: Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said 'It is clear that we need a new approach to dealing with the disclosure of minor juvenile convictions'

Critics, however, are likely to say that the fear of carrying a criminal record is a key deterrent to potential young offenders.

The number of people forced to disclose offences is high, with four million requests for CRB certificates made by employers last year.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons
 home affairs select committee, told the Telegraph: 'It is clear that we need a new 
approach to dealing with the disclosure of minor juvenile convictions.

'Non-serious misdemeanours at a 
young age should not affect someone’s chances in life, as was shown by 
the farce of high-quality candidates having to stand down from the 
Police and Crime Commissioner elections.

'While we need appropriate 
safeguards in place, the system should be fair and proportionate.'

Falklands War veteran Simon Weston has previously criticised the system after he was forced to pull out of the running for the police commissioner elections.

He had been a passenger in a stolen car, aged just 14, prompting him to call for a change in the law.

Corinna Ferguson, the legal officer for 
Liberty, said: 'The overzealous CRB system has allowed old, minor and 
unreliable information to wreck the lives of too many hard-working 
people in the UK. The Government can’t put off dealing with this any 
longer.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Court of Appeal has yet to make a ruling. We will respond when it does.'
