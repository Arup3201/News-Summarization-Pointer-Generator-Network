Portuguese police are searching for a gang of five paedophiles they believe may have snatched missing youngster of Madeleine McCann.

The fresh circle of suspects were spotted near the apartment from where Madeleine, was snatched in 2007.

The new development comes after the country's authorities reopened their
 inquiry into the disappearance of the child, five years after 
they controversially shelved the investigation.

Officers from Porto's Policia Judiciaria believe foreign perverts may have kidnapped the three-year-old

Officers from Porto’s Policia Judiciaria believe foreign perverts kidnapped the three-year-old, who would now be 10, the Mirror reported.

The
 country’s attorney general authorised the new look into the case this week after ‘highly 
significant’ new evidence was identified by local detectives.

She said ‘new elements of evidence’ and new witnesses justified the continuation of the original investigation.

Madeleine’s
 parents Kate and Gerry, who were wrongly suspected of being responsible
 for their daughter’s disappearance during the shambolic first inquiry 
by Portuguese police, welcomed the news.

‘We
 are very pleased. We hope that this will finally lead to her being 
found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime,’ 
they said in a statement.

The
 new investigation will work with Scotland Yard’s multi-million-pound 
inquiry into Madeleine’s disappearance, which was the subject of a major
 appeal on BBC1’s Crimewatch programme last week.

She was three when she disappeared from the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in May 2007.

Scotland
 Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal 
investigation in July this  year after identifying dozens of potential 
suspects and scores of new lines of inquiry.

Portuguese
 police said yesterday that their own review team had been working since
 March 2011 to reassess files from the original investigation and this 
process had uncovered new leads. A well-placed source told the Mail they
 could be ‘highly significant’.

Probe: Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood in the Scotland Yard incident room where British officers are launching their own search for Madeleine

Authorities
 have put a secrecy order on the new material, banning it from being 
made public, but Portuguese law states that unsolved cases can be 
reopened only when there is strong new evidence.

The
 fresh probe was authorised by Joana Marques Vidal, Portugal’s first 
female attorney general, who was not in the post when the original 
investigation was shelved.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is in charge of the Yard’s inquiry, met senior Portuguese police in Lisbon late last week to be briefed on the new  lines of inquiry, which are said to be separate to those being followed by the Met. The McCanns were also briefed.

Mr Rowley said the meeting was ‘very positive’ and both forces had a ‘shared determination’ to solve the case.

Home Secretary Theresa May welcomed the development, saying: ‘I hope what we are going to see is a resolution of this case for the sake of Maddie’s parents and family.’

Earlier this month Scotland Yard spoke of a possible breakthrough after it emerged that officers were analysing data from the phone records of people who were in Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished.
