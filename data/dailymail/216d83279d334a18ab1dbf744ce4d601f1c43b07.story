A documentary filmmaker has revealed the nightmares he witnessed after he was arrested and interrogated by the Syrian authorities.

Sean McAllister was working for Channel 4 News covering the rebellion in the country when he was detained in a Damascus cafe last week.

He said he and his local activist contact Jihad were blindfolded and driven at speed to a prison in the city.

Ordeal: Sean McAllister described the horrific sights and sounds he witnessed inside a Syrian jail

He said: 'I was placed on a seat in an empty room on my own. Outside I could hear beatings in a neighbouring room. People being slapped and wailing painfully as they were being whacked.'

Mr McAllister, from south London, was held with opponents of Bashar al-Assad's regime and described how they were treated.

'When they are taken out of the cell they are blindfolded and their hands are tied', he said speaking on Channel 4 News.

'They are taken down the corridor to this, well, they don't know where they are going, the whole thing, having been blindfolded for a little bit, the disorientation, of never seeing and the person you keep meeting is just a voice that you hear and you have to see him on one knee, you are forced to kneel on one knee.

'It's a very awkward position to be in for maybe an hour of interrogation.

'If they are not satisfied with the 
info, you would be brought out at three in the morning into the torture 
chamber and whipped with the cable or there was like a hundred leather 
belts, like a big ball of leather belts, in the corner'.

His
account reveals an insight into how dissent is handled amid the ongoing
rebellion. He also told of his fears for those Syrians who had assisted
him who he said are now likely targets for the regime.

He said: 'I'd seen these things that they'd use, because the cable was next to my bed one night.

'It was so heavy, it was so awful, it must have been broken bones.

'And the howling, the noise of a human being hit with that is something that just, you know, you shiver and shake.

'You hear a sound that you've never heard before. I've never heard before.

'And I've seen people dead. And I've seen people dying. And I've seen people decapitated, but this sound hearing a man cry, is just like, awful, there's nothing to compare it with.'

Mr McAllister said he did not know what happened to Jihad, and feared for the safety of others who had been helping him film.

'I didn't realise exactly what those guys are risking until I went into that experience and my God those guys are brave. Too brave', he added.

His revelations come as Amnesty International claims the Syrian government is using hospitals in its war on dissidents.

The human rights group says wounded patients in at least four government-run hospitals have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including by medical workers.One video, aired on Syrian state television and posted on YouTube in April, appears to show a medic hitting an injured protestor.Videos like this are impossible to verify independently, because Syria wonâ€™t allow Western journalists into the country.

But Cilina Nasser of Amnesty says the evidence she has gathered is overwhelming.

'Even before I came across this video, we received consistent testimonies from wounded persons who were subjected to physical abuse at the hands of health professionals. And also testimonies from health professionals who are outraged by the conduct of their colleagues,' she said.

This video, which can be seen below, apparently to show dead and injured protestors at a private clinic in the coastal city of Banias.

Amnesty says the day after it was posted on YouTube in May, government forces raided the hospital looking for an alleged armed field commander opposed to the government.

The UN says more than 2,900 people have been killed in the crackdown on anti-government protests since they began in March.
