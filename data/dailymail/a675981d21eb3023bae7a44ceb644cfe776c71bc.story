The iconic Television Centre was home to the BBC for more than 50 years before it was sold and subsequently closed in March. 

Before the centre shut its doors and staff began relocating to new offices in central London and Manchester, Google mapped its maze-like corridors, studios, facades and production rooms using its Street View cameras. 

Users can now virtually explore all seven floors of the building as well as sets from the recent Doctor Who show, An Adventure in Space and Time tucked away on the fifth floor.

Before the BBC Television Centre shut its doors in March, Google mapped the circular building's maze-like corridors, studios and newsroom production offices, pictured using its Street View cameras. Users can now virtually explore all seven floors of the building

The centre was the home of BBC Television from June 1960 until March 2013. 

It was designed by architect Graham 
Dawbarn and its circular shape houses seven floors, control rooms, 25 
studios in total - including the newsrooms - and a restaurant.

The 
basement was used as dressing rooms and video storage space.

After various departments, including 
children’s and sport, were relocated to Salford in Manchester, the BBC 
announced in September 2010 it would be selling the building.

It was finally sold in July last year for £200 million and developer Stanhope PLC plans to turn the building into a modern studio centre, hotel, 
apartments and the commercial headquarters of the BBC.

Google recently tweeted the images to coincide with the show’s broadcast.

It was made to celebrate the 50th anniversary since the first episode of the sci-fi show was produced. 

The centre was the home of BBC Television from June 1960 until March 2013.

Parts of the building are Grade II listed, including the central ring and Studio 1.

The front of the centre became an iconic sight and regularly featured in BBC shows including Children in Need during which fundraising amounts and images of Pudsey Bear were projected onto the side.

News
 departments moved to Broadcasting House in central London to join BBC 
Radio, and the centre was finally sold in July last year for £200 
million - although the site won’t be completely abandoned until 2015.

When it was built, the original site cost a fraction of this price at just £9,000,000. 

While Google was photgraphing the building, the recent Doctor Who show An Adventure in Space and Time was being filmed. Sets from the show, including the offices pictured, can be found on the fifth floor

From above, the centre is said to resemble a question mark and the entire site covers around 14 acres of White City in West London.

The building has a central circular 
block, known as the Main Block but referred to as the ‘doughnut’, with a
 statue of Helios, the Greek god of the sun, with two figures 
underneath. 

The statue was
 designed by TB Huxley-Jones and was meant to be symbolic of the 
'radiation of television around the world’, while the figures were said 
to represent ‘sound and vision.'

Another set from the Doctor Who show An Adventure in Space and Time. The programme was aired on BBC Two on 21 November and was set in the 1960s and starred David Bradley as the original Doctor, William Hartnell

The basement of the centre was used as dressing rooms and video storage space. There are also shrines to various BBC shows built into the walls, including Eastenders, pictured

Many of the floors and doors around the centre show no entry signs after floors were vacated. The whole building will be empty by 2015

According
 to a documentary, the statue was originally a fountain
 but after water leaked into the tape storage unit in the basement 
below, the fountain was switched off.

Many of the signs, including panels 
in the walls, floors and tiles, feature the iconic BBC Television Centre
 letting created by Arthur Hayes. 

The
 model of the wall on the front of the building is covered in 26 tiny 
holes, known as the Atomic Dots and these were backlit to make them 
stand out at night. 

In 2001 a bomb was planted outside the centre in a taxi by the Real IRA. 

Police officers attempted to carry out a controlled explosion on the bomb with a bomb-disposal robot but it went off. 

Staff had already been evacuated after a tip off an hour before one hour before and no-one was seriously injured.

Developer
 Stanhope PLC, which bought the centre, plans to turn the building into a
 modern studio centre, hotel, apartments and the commercial headquarters
 of the BBC.

There are 25 studios in total, including newsrooms situated around the building. This studio, with cameras still fitted to the ceiling, is situated on the third floor. After various departments, including children¿s and sport, were relocated to Salford in Manchester, the BBC announced in September 2010 it would be selling the building
