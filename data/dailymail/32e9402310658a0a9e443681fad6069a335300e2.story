She became Britain's most reviled mother after faking the kidnap of her own daughter in a bid to scoop reward money.

But now it's claimed Karen Matthews wants to become a mother again by starting another family with her new lover.

Since her release from prison  for kidnapping her nine-year-old daughter Shannon, the 36-year-old has been dating the man.

He began writing to Matthews when she was behind bars and now, according to relatives, she is in love and wants to have his children.

The family member told the Daily Star Sunday: 'Karen began exchanging letters with a man while she was in prison.

He was in prison too and he was released first and began visiting her.

'She says he is her boyfriend and they are planning to have kids together. They have met up several times since she was released at Easter.'

Matthews was jailed in 2008 for the horrifying crime of kidnapping her own daughter and doping her up with temazepam and travel sickness pills.

She was freed from prison last month after serving just half of her eight year sentence.

However, Matthews could be facing jail again after a probe into alleged benefit fraud was reopened.

Investigators are examining more than £100,000 she is believed to have pocketed between 2004 and 2009.

Matthews was entitled to much of it - including thousands of pounds in child benefit.

But Government officials are understood to be analysing the rest of her claims to make sure she really was entitled to it.

A source told The People: 'If she's found guilty she faces another stretch inside.

'But anyone who knows her thinks it's only a matter of time till she's back behind bars. It's where she belongs.'

Matthews is said to have claimed up to £400 a week in benefits while living with supermarket fishmonger Craig Meehan who earned £16,000 a year.

She told officials at the time she got no child support from the five men who fathered her children and was therefore due the cash.

Pictures following her release showed Matthews strolling freely through the streets near her bail hostel in southern England with a completely new look.

Clad in a cream coat and blue jeans, the ex-convict looked calm as she returned to her bail hostel  following a trip out with another woman.

Matthews was given a full makeover including a new hairstyle before her release to prevent her being recognised in the street, and now lives under an assumed name.

She was chasing £50,000 of reward money when she tried to con police into thinking a predator had kidnapped her daughter.

The crime, carried out with 44-year-old Michael Donovan, saw her launch tearful pleas for help finding the nine-year-old, who she held captive for 24 days.

The mother-of-seven was freed from Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire last month and taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire.

Unlike Maxine Carr, who was jailed after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, she has not been given a new identity including a new National Insurance number and passport.

Such a move would have cost the taxpayer £250,000 and required Matthews to keep her real identity a secret.

It is not known if Matthews requested a new identity. But officials were so concerned that she would jeopardise it and her safety by failing to keep it a secret that they ruled it out.

Matthews will use the assumed name when she comes into contact with people in a social setting, but when she is dealing with officialdom she will use her real name and rely on client and patient confidentiality to protect her identity.

She will be supported in this by probation officers. Matthews, whose children are now in care, will remain on licence for the rest of her sentence.

During that time she must observe strict rules or face being returned to jail.
