Conor McGregor delivered on his promise to stop Dustin Poirier in the first round as the Irishman's seemingly inexorable rise continued in Las Vegas.

The Dublin featherweight caught his opponent with a cuffing left hand behind the ear inside the opening two minutes and the fight was called off after a barrage of shots rained in on the canvas.

McGregor said: 'I don't just knock them out, I pick the round.

'What the other featherweights don't understand is that it's a whole other game when they get hit by me. 

'I felt really good. I tore my ligaments in my thumb four weeks ago which disrupted my training. 

'I wanted to put on a performance. I said I'd knock him out in the first round and I knocked him out in the first round.

'You can call me Mystic Meg because I predict these things.The world title is next.' 

In the main event, Demetrious Johnson retained his flyweight title, submitting Chris Cariaso in the second round.

Johnson easily scored a takedown in the first session and stunned Cariaso with a looping right hook, followed by a knee to the jaw as the horn sounded to end the round.

Johnson kept the pressure on in the second and gained top control after Cariaso slipped. Johnson swiftly maneuvered into side control, landed a few elbows and secured a Kimura, forcing Cariaso to tap out at 2:29 of the second.

'I felt good. It was a great fight,' Johnson said. 'I'm just trying to get better at my ground game.' 

In the co-main event, lightweight Donald Cerrone moved closer to a title shot with a unanimous decision over Eddie Alvarez. Cerrone used powerful leg kicks to wear down Alvarez, winning 29-28 on all three scorecards.

'There's no quit in this dog,' Cerrone said. 'If you're going to beat me, you better do it in the first.'
