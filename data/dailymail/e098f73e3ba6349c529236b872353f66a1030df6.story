It might have been a mild 65 degrees in St Petersburg, Florida, today - but it didn't stop these happy kids having a snowball fight.

Pupils at the Douglas L. Jameson Jr. Elementary School in the central Florida city, on the Gulf of Mexico coast, put on their winter coats and Santa hats after six tonnes of the white stuff was trucked in.

They got a taste of the unseasonable weather for their 'snow day', which is sponsored by the PTA.

As well as indulging in a classic snowball fight, the students also made snowmen and rode sleds down a ramp.

For some students it was their first ever experience with snow. Fifth-grader Layla Frazier, who threw one of the first snowballs, stopped briefly to say: 'It's fun'.

St Petersburg is a very unlikely candidate for December snow - with an average low temperature of 56 degrees, according to the Weather Channel.

The record low for December - recorded in 1938 - was 35 degrees, still slightly above freezing point.

It is unclear how much the event cost, but comparable 'snow party' services offer several tons of snow for around $1,200. 

In a statement, a member of the PTA said: 'It was a wonderful day with lots of fun had by all students and staff!' 

Fun for all: Laura Rohan, a first-grade teacher, laughs alongside her pupil Hayden George, left, at the bottom of the sledding ramp

New experiences: Some of the students and the school have never seen or touched snow in real life before
