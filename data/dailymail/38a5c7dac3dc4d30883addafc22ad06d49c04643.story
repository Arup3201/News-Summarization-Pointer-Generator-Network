Leeds have announced the double signing of midfielder Tommaso Bianchi and striker Souleymane Doukara.

The duo's arrival takes president Massimo Cellino's summer signing spree to four following the captures of goalkeeping pair Marco Silvestri and Stuart Taylor.

Colourful former Cagliari owner Cellino has been making waves ever since his arrival at Elland Road in January and, after selling captain Ross McCormack to Fulham for a fee understood to be Â£11million, is now building a squad for new head coach Dave Hockaday to select from.

Heading for Yorkshire: Tommaso Bianchi  has joined Leeds from Sassuolo on a four-year deal

Bianchi has signed a four-year deal with Leeds from Serie A side Sassuolo - achieving promotion with them in 2013.

The 25-year-old is an age-grade Italian international and Hockaday believes he can occupy a number of roles.

'He can play on the left, right or in the number 10 position and he can score goals,' he said of Bianchi, who spent last season on loan with Modena.

Cellino has also moved to try and fill McCormack's position with the season-long loan of Senegalese striker Doukara.

He joins from Catania, spending last season on loan with Serie B side Juve Stabia.

'He is a big, powerful and fast player with a hunger to succeed. He is exactly what we need at the club.'

Cellino is close to making a fifth signing in the shape of Switzerland international defender Jonathan Rossini, but it is understood he has no interest in Rochdale's Scott Hogan or Rotherham's Kieran Agard, contrary to reports.

While Cellino makes changes to his first-team, he has also been making alterations to the club's academy with coaches Leigh Bromby and Richard Naylor - both part of Leeds' promotion-winning side in 2010 - leaving their posts.

Former Sheffield Wednesday striker Benito Carbone is working in an unpaid role at the academy.
