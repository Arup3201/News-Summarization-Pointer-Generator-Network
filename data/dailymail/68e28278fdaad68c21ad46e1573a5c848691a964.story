The NYPD forced a popular store to shut down on Wednesday after the release of a highly-anticipated new shoe caused a 'near riot' among several hundred 'sneakerheads'.

Witnesses told the New York Post that on Wednesday night some members of the young crowd outside Supreme New York grew anxious ahead of the next morning's planned release of the 
$250 Supreme/Nike Air Foamposite sneakers, rushed the closed establishment and were Maced by police.

'Some belligerent guy in the front of the line tried to bum-rush the 
door,' Bradley James, 20, of Queens told the Post. 'He started yelling and then 
somebody else started yelling and before you knew it, the crowd was 
rushing toward the store.'

Police say a large crowd gathered outside a SoHo store Wednesday for the release of a pricey, highly-anticipated new sneaker

Police are seen Thursday at the Supreme store on Lafayette Street where NYPD shut down a sale of the new "Supreme Nike Air Foamposites" due to safety concerns

Jesus Montero, 18, of Bushwick, Brooklyn told the newspaper: 'It was a war zone 
after that because the police broke out the Mace and the batons and we 
all got trampled, then thrown out.'

However,
 police told multiple media outlets that no arrests were made, no 
injuries were reported and the crowd was peaceful overall.

Photos and videos posted online showed a sea of people outside the store clogging much of the surrounding block on Wednesday.

That evening, the business hung a sign in its window calling off in-store sales of the sneaker and also posted a statement online.

'Due to concern for public safety, NYPD 
has forced us to not sell the Supreme/Nike Foamposites and accompanying 
clothing in our New York Store,' the statement said. 'These items will be available on 
supremenewyork.com tomorrow (Thursday) at 11am EST.'

Police dispersed the crowd Wednesday, though another large line formed Thursday of people who apparently did not know the sneaker's sales had been cancelled or who perhaps hoped the store would sell the shoes anyway, according to MyFoxNy.com.

The line had begun to form on Monday as dozens of people camped out hoping to be one of the first to get their hands on the new kicks.

As of Thursday afternoon, the shoe retailer's website said it was sold out of the sneaker.

On eBay, pairs of the new sneaker were listed for several hundred dollars above the retail price. Most were listed in the $850 to $950 range, while one set was listed for $2,000.

Supreme teamed up with Nike to produce a new version of the Nike Air Foamposite 1, which was originally launched in 1997 as a signature model for Penny Hardaway
