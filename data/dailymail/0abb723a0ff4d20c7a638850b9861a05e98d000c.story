Aston Villa’s missing fans will need a little more convincing before they start queuing around the block for season tickets despite an impressive late cameo from teenager Jack Grealish.

Paul Lambert’s men showed enough huff and puff against Parma on their first appearance at Villa Park this pre-season but rarely looked like breaking down the disciplined Italians until injury time when Darren Bent hit the crossbar.

It has been a frustrating build-up to the campaign for Villa who had lost two of their previous three friendlies against Chesterfield and Groningen.

New beginnings: Roy Keane is working alongside Paul Lambert as the club's new assistant manager

Mr Reliable: Brad Guzan was Villa's stand-out player last season with a series of outstanding displays

On the move: Fabian Delph will be looking to build on an encouraging season last term

There were encouraging displays from youngster Grealish, and Charles N’Zogbia and Alan Hutton who hardly got a kick for Villa last season due to injury and loan spells. But with Christian Benteke still on the treatment table, a lack of firepower will worry Lambert and his assistant Roy Keane.

Season ticket sales are substantially down from last season’s figure of 28,000 and Holte Enders may want to see how the team perform in their first Premier League game at Stoke next weekend before deciding whether to commit for the campaign.

Villa’s first home game in the league is against Newcastle United on August 23.

Parma’s best-known player to English fans was Gabriel Paletta, who used to play for Liverpool and was part of Italy’s World Cup squad in Brazil this summer.

The visitors certainly gave a decent demonstration of the Italian art of defending and Villa were restricted to half-chances for Andreas Weimann and Fabian Delph in a poor opening 45 minutes.

Villa tried to introduce more zip in the second period. Weimann was foiled by goalkeeper Antonio Mirante and Kieran Richardson had an effort land on the roof of the net.

Forgotten man: Alan Hutton may yet turn his Aston Villa career around under Paul Lambert 

Back on track? Bent and Senderos could become  key players for Villa this season

The arrival of substitute Bent after 64 minutes reminded Villa fans they do have a proven goalscorer on their books but the question is whether he still remains potent at the age of 30.

At the other end of the age scale, 18-year-old Grealish showed promise of a brighter future for the long-suffering Claret and Blues.

One strong run after 75 minutes had the Parma defence backtracking. Perhaps the youngster should have taken a shot but he unselfishly laid a pass off to fellow substitute Leandro Bacuna, who took a heavy first touch to waste the opening.

Encouraged, Bent made a sharp into the penalty area but captain Gaby Agbonlahor placed his cross too close to the defence and the ball never arrived.

Karim El Ahmadi showed ambition with a late long-range shot then Bent hit the crossbar from a pull-back by Grealish. It was close, but not close enough. Villa must hope that is not going to be the story of their season.

Elsewhere, Ron Vlaar came on as a late substitute for the home side as he made his first appearance since the World Cup.
