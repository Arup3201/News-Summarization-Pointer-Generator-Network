French security agents regularly spy illegally on phone calls, according to reports, which will embarrass President Francois Hollande, who has vocally criticsied the U.S.

French security agents regularly spy illegally on people's phone calls, emails, and social media activity, intelligence sources confirmed today.

Revelations about the covert activities follow President Francois Hollande attacking America for its own espionage activities, and saying they should stop 'immediately'.

Le Monde, the most famous and best respected newspaper in France, today carries a detailed report outlining the behaviour of the DGSE, the country's notoriously ruthless external intelligence agency.

It says the DGSE intercepts signals from computers and telephones - including foreign ones - to work out 'who is talking to whom'.

Such activity boils down to wiretapping, even though this is officially strictly forbidden following a number of scandals in the past.

'All of our communications are spied on,' says Le Monde's report, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, as well as remarks made publicly by intelligence officials.

'Emails, text messages, telephone records, access to Facebook and Twitter are then stored for years,' it says.

Such activities are just like those carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency, as described in documents leaked by former NSA worker Edward Snowden.

He confirmed that the NSA keeps vast amounts of Internet data under a programme called Prism. It includes emails, chat room conversations and videos taken from sites run by giants like Facebook and Google.

The U.S. government also gathers so-called 'metadata', noting the time, duration and numbers called - all listed by service providers like Verizon.

The revelations will be an embarrassment to France, which has vocally criticised the U.S. after the Snowden leaks.

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls today publicly dressed down the United States at the American ambassador's 
July 4 garden party, denouncing alleged U.S. 'espionage' of France and 
other countries.

Tensions between France and the U.S. have been strained since former NSA worker Edward Snowden leaked documents suggesting America regularly spied on its European allies

Valls was guest of honor at the fete hosted by Ambassador Charles Rivkin
 Thursday.

In a speech before hundreds of guests, he said that 'in the 
name of our friendship, we owe each other honesty. We must say things 
clearly, directly, frankly.'

He said that President Francois Hollande's demand for clear and precise 
explanations about reports of U.S. spying are justified because 'such 
practices, if proven, do not have their place between allies and 
partners.'

European countries agreed Wednesday that planned talks on free trade 
with the U.S. must start in parallel with discussions on National 
Security Agency surveillance.

France's DGSE has publicly always insisted that it works within the law, but its past activities have included the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior ecological protest boat in 1985.

The operation against the Greenpeace craft - which caused the death of a Dutch activist - violated New Zealand neutrality and caused international outrage.

It was ordered by former Socialist president Francois Mitterand, who was himself linked with an illegal wiretapping cell within France itself.

But France's national security commission has challenged Le Monde's report, saying that the only body that collects communications information was a security agency controlled by the prime minister's office.

Earlier this week, President Hollande threatened to block negotiations on transatlantic trade following revelations that the US spied on its allies.

'We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies,' Mr Hollande said.

'We ask that this immediately stop. There can be no negotiations or transactions in all areas until we have obtained these guarantees, for France but also for all of the European Union, for all partners of the United States.'

The DGSE revelations will now leave Mr Hollande looking, at best, incredibly naieve, and at worst extremely hypocritical.

France's seven other intelligence services, including domestic secret services and customs and money-laundering watchdogs, have access to the DGSE data, writes Le Monde .

Britain is said to have a similar spying programme on international phone and Internet traffic, and is said to share personal information with the American NSA.

A spokesman for the DGSE in Paris refused to comment directly on Le Monde's report.
