Thousands of academy schools are ‘not helping our kids’ and could be forced back under council control by Labour, Ed Miliband warned yesterday.

The Labour leader hit out at the ‘alphabet soup’ of school structures, including academies, which were championed by Tony Blair, and free schools, which were introduced by the Coalition.

In comments that appeared to go much further than Labour’s official policy, Mr Miliband suggested all schools should be placed back under local bureaucrats.

Mr Miliband’s comments came during a question and answer session with local people in Hucknall, near Nottingham - the first in a series of ‘People’s Question Time’ events the Labour leader is planning in the run-up to the election.

Mr Miliband said: 'You have got to have proper local accountability. You cannot run thousands of schools from Whitehall' during a question and answer session  in Hucknall near Nottingham

Responding to a question from a representative of the National Union of Teachers, Mr Miliband said: ‘The alphabet soup of different kinds of schools - free schools, academies, trust schools and all that - is not helping our kids.

‘You have got to have proper local accountability. You cannot run thousands of schools from Whitehall - Michael Gove has certainly proved that. You can’t run all these schools from central government.’ 

Mr Miliband then posed for pictures with NUT rep Laura Hastie, a primary school teacher, while holding a copy of the militant union’s education ‘manifesto’.

The document calls for all state-funded schools to be put back under the control of local councils.

It also calls for an end to free schools, and urges a cap on teachers’ working hours, as well as making numerous demands for more funding.

Self-governance is a key feature of academy and free schools, which supporters say gives them the freedom to innovate and drive through improvements without council interference or bureaucracy.

Labour’s Blairite shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, has adopted a much more positive approach to academies than his leader.

Mr Hunt has said Labour would not approve any more free schools, but would introduce a new class of ‘parent-led academies’ - potentially adding to the ‘alphabet soup’ attacked by Mr Miliband yesterday.

Mr Hunt has also proposed the introduction of local ‘directors of standards’ to keep tabs on academy and free schools and encourage greater co-operation.

But he has not suggested they should be placed fully back under local authority control.

A Conservative spokesman last night said Mr Miliband’s comments left Labour’s education policy in ‘complete chaos’.

He added: ‘They have no plan to raise standards in our schools. In fact, we now know that Ed Miliband wants to turn the clock back and undo everything that has been achieved under this government.

‘As a result of our plan for education and the success of our free schools and academies programme, a million more children are being taught in good and outstanding schools, 100,000 more six year-olds are on course to become confident readers and parents have more choice than ever before.

'Labour would put all of this progress at risk because they are driven by the interests of the unions rather than those of pupils and parents.’

Michael Gove (pictured at Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London in 2011 when he was Education Secretary) has certainly proven that schools 'cannot' be run 'from central government', according to Mr Miliband

A Labour source yesterday said there was no change of policy and said Mr Miliband was simply re-stating his position.

In a separate development, Mr Miliband said Labour plans to offer a pay boost to thousands of workers providing care to the elderly.

‘When we are talking about one of the most important jobs in our society, it is also one of the worst-paid jobs in our society - that is looking after elderly people.’

We are going to have more to say about this in the coming weeks - about how we can do more for those people doing that really important job of looking after elderly people.

A Labour source confirmed the party is examining ways to boost the pay of care workers, but was unable to provide details of what the new policy would mean.

The party has previously criticised the practice of offering 15-minute care appointments in people’s homes, where carers are often not paid for the time spent travelling between appointments.

‘These people do an important job and don’t get a fair deal. We are going to do something about that,’ a source said.
