An emotional courtroom in Tennessee heard a jury find mother Lindsey Lowe guilty of the first degree premeditated murder of her newborn twin sons today.

After deliberating for only two hours, Lowe, 26, was found guilty on two counts each of felony first degree murder and felony premeditated murder and was sentenced to two-life terms for her crimes.

And as Judge Dee Gay revoked her bond and placed her into immediate custody Lowe turned to her distraught family members and mouth 'I'll be alright. I love you all', as she was escorted from the courtroom.

In all, the jury of seven men and five women convicted Nashville resident Lowe of felony murder, premeditated murder and aggravated child abuse.

Lowe will return for sentencing on the two counts of aggravated child abuse on April 26th.

Lowe, who was often emotional during the trial, kept a stony-face as she was convicted of killing her twin boys at her parents home on September 12th, 2011 - after keeping her pregnancy secret from her friends and family.

At trial, jurors saw a video of Lowe telling police she had given birth alone in the bathroom of her parents’ home on September 12th, 2011, and smothered the babies soon after.

The bodies weren’t found until two days later. A family member discovered one baby dead in a laundry basket at the home in Hendersonville, 20 miles northeast of Nashville.

When police arrived to investigate, officers found the second body under a bloody sheet in the same basket.

Lowe was engaged at the time but became pregnant during an affair with another man, jurors were told.

She hid the pregnancy from her family and friends, and the defense and prosecution offered competing arguments as to why.

Hendersonville Police Detective Steve Malach testified that Lowe told him during an interrogation that she had kept her pregnancy secret so as not to disappoint her fiance or add to the stress of a family member’s illness.

In a video of the interrogation, Lowe said she 'maybe' smothered them when she put her hand over the mouths of the babies.

'I was just trying to keep them quiet,' she said on the video.

Malach testified that police searched the home thoroughly but found no evidence that Lowe had made any plans for the birth.

The defense said Lowe wanted to block out the idea of being pregnant and said she didn’t even know she was giving birth until one of the babies came out in the toilet.

'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' defense attorney John Pellegrin told the jury.

Psychiatrist Dr. William Kenner testified for the defense that Lowe had blocked out her pregnancy then suffered shock and delirium from blood loss after she gave birth.

Prosecutor Ray Whitley countered that by presenting evidence of Internet searches on Lowe’s iPhone for information on inducing labor and pornography involving pregnant women.

Family, friends and church members, who have rallied to support Lowe, were sobbing after the verdict.

Her father, Mark, and sister, Lacey, testified on behalf of Lowe, both saying no one knew she was pregnant.

The sister said they both had been in a wedding just days before the birth and Lindsey Lowe didn’t appear pregnant when she undressed in front of other women in the wedding party.

The defendant didn’t testify. 'I just don’t feel like I can emotionally handle it,' she told the judge Monday, while fighting back tears.

And yesterday the jury was shown photographs taken two days before Lowe gave birth to twin boys at her parents' home, smothered them and dumped their dead bodies in the laundry.

She was pictured as a bridesmaid at a wedding in Lebanon, Kentucky on September 10, 2011, just two days before the murder of her two sons in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

The images how Lowe in a strapless, floor-length gown that she had been fitted for six months earlier - and her sister testified that no one ever suspected she was pregnant at the ceremony.

No sign: Family said Lindsey's weight often fluctuated so they did not suspect she was pregnant

Speaking on the stand on Monday, Lacey Lowe said that her sister's weight often fluctuated so she did not think anything of it when she started to put on weight.

She added that Lindsey changed clothes in front of the other women at the wedding and no one ever thought she was pregnant, Channel News 5 reported.

Lacey, 23, who shared the bathroom where her sister gave birth to two healthy boys, said Lindsey told her she had an upset stomach the morning after she gave birth.

She only found out that her sister had been pregnant when she was told by a police chaplain, she said.

Also testifying on Monday, their father, Mark Lowe, described the moment he saw the dead body of one of his grandchildren - and how he was in so much shock, he waited 15 minutes to call for help.

He said his wife, Paula, found one infant on the morning of September 14, 2011 and called him with 'some panic in her voice' to come upstairs.

'She said there was a newborn child in Lindsey's room and at that point I looked at the child and was frankly not sure what I would do next,' he told the court. 'I was pretty much in shock... I really did not know who to call or what I should do.'

About 15 minutes passed before he called an attorney friend, who advised him to call a pastor.

He then called Hendersonville police and said he asked them to take Lindsey, who was at work at the time, to the hospital.

He said he also asked for his daughter to be allowed to have an attorney when she talked to police, but he said he was told this would not be possible.

Lindsey Lowe also made a brief appearance on the stand to explain that she was waiving her right to testify.

'I just don't feel like I can emotionally handle it,' she said.

On trial: Lindsey Lowe could get life in prison without parole if she is convicted of first-degree murder

Last week, prosecutors showed pictures 
of Lowe's home after the babies were discovered, including the bathroom she cleaned and the laundry basket where their tiny bodies were found.

The jury also heard details of the autopsies, in which the Medical Examiner 
said both boys were healthy and alive when they were born.

Prosecutors have said that she told police that she smothered the twins so her parents would not hear their cries.

The jury will now deliberate. If convicted of first-degree murder, Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said previously they would not seek the death penalty.
