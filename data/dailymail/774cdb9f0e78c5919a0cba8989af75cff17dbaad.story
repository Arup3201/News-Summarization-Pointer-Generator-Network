Competitors stripped off to compete in Sochi today, with skiers competing in their vests and some athletes even using the snow to cool down as temperatures rose to 18 degrees celsius (64F) today.

Sochi was warmer on Thursday than any of the last 10 cities to have hosted the Winter Games, while it was even warmer than Athens, who hosted the Summer Olympics in 2004.

Forecasters predict that temperatures will not cool down until Saturday at the earliest, with Sochi on course to be the warmest ever Winter Games, surpassing Vancouver 2010.

On Thursday, several competitors in the women's cross country started the race in sleeveless tops, an unusual sight.

Organisers played down concerns about snow conditions that several athletes have described as slushy and difficult, and may explain some of the crashes in disciplines ranging from freestyle skiing slopestyle to cross country.

'It is a constant battle for winter sports,' said Mark Adams, International Olympic Committee spokesman. 'We are always trying to battle with a dynamic field of play. We are relaxed but we watch the situation.'

Lying down on the job: The women's 10km cross-country classic was particularly bathed in sunshine. For some volunteers, it all appeared a bit too much

More than we should see: For some, the weather proved so tough that they had to remove clothing altogether. Volunteer Sergey Gakh went topless after sunbathing near the Alpine ski finish area at the men's downhill combined

Embarrassed? Mr Gakh wrings out his T-shirt, unperturbed at being the only person near him sporting his particular look

Sochi 2014 spokesman Aleksandra Kosterina said they have not had to tap into the snow reserves they are storing on the mountain.

Olympics authorities in Russia have 
reservoirs of snow packed away near the mountain venues yet dismissed 
calls for it to be used, claiming it was not needed.

'We are not worried, but at the same time we are ready for taking measures if there is a need,' she said.

Sunny weather in the Russian resort 
has melted ski and snowboard runs, leaving huge patches of grass exposed
 and making the athletes' intricately-prepared runs treacherous.

U.S. Alpine ski racer Bode Miller went from being a pre-race favourite during training runs down an icy hill to an eighth-place finisher when the downhill course got slushier on Sunday.

He said: 'It would be a tough call to be like, "The weather is changing, we're just going to go completely throw a dart in the dark and hope it hits." We had to stick with what we knew.

'In hindsight, it was a mistake, because on training day, it was boilerplate ice and you needed a lot of edge. And on race day, you needed to be more subtle, more smooth'

Austrian ski jumper Wilhelm Denifl said: 'Holes and ruts form if the snow on the landing zone is not hard enough... The snow becomes unstable, and if we are landing consistently in the same area, and at a high speed, the pressure associated with landing can make it unstable. And dangerous.'

Friday's
 downhill ski start was pushed up to 10a.m. (0600 GMT), one hour earlier
 than originally scheduled, in a bid to get going before sunshine 
softens the snow. The slalom is scheduled for five hours hours later.

Residents and visitors at the Winter Olympics resorts have been stripping off on the beach and frolicking in the Black Sea.

Dmitry
 Chernyshenko, head of the local organising committee, told journalists: 'It's not a big surprise for us.
 We're a subtropical city'.

Four years ago in Vancouver dozens of races were delayed by warm
 weather in Whistler, British Columbia, while at Turin, Italy, in 2006 
the women's super-G was postponed 24 hours. Skiing in Nagano, Japan, had
 to wait for two days in 
1998 and at Sarajevo in 1984, 
both downhill races were postponed.

Whew! Kaylee Weil, from San Diego, California, takes a drink of water while walking through the Olympic Park wearing a sun dress today. The heat is set to increase over the next few days to 17 degrees celsius

ALPINE SKIING: Cold keeps the snow 
along the course icier and therefore more compact and slick. Softer snow means it's easier to make turns, but also slows down the skiers, tempting them to take more risks and be more aggressive otherwise they can't build up enough speed.

HALFPIPE:
 Riders call the slush 'mashed potatoes' and it slows them
 down, making it harder to get enough air to pull off flips and 
twists. Conditions must be as perfect as possible and start slipping when the temperature gets anywhere above freezing.

SLOPESTYLE:
 The firmer the snow surface, the better it is for slopestyle skiers and
 snowboarders, because it gives the athletes a firmer takeoff and more time in the air.

SNOWBOARDCROSS:
 Soft snow can slow down the cars and turn races into more strategy as speed, which could make things more interesting for the viewers if not the athletes.

SKI
 JUMPING: Athletes risk injury when the artificial snow in the landing area is heated by the sun. Their landings
 become bumpy, which can throw competitors off-balance and make them 
fall. Also, their skis could dig too far into the snow. The ramp itself 
is kept cool by a refrigeration
 unit.

CROSS COUNTRY 
AND BIATHLON: Courses become treacherous in the downhill
 curves, where it's easy to lose one's balance at high speed on thin 
skis. Skiers adjust the amount of wax on their skis and can change the setup several times a day.

SLIDING
 SPORTS: Many of the sliding competitions are being held at night for lower temperatures. Miles of pipe installed in tracks pump temperature-controlled ammonia 
through the concrete, keeping the surface cold enough during the day. Shades installed on the track's roof also 
shield the ice from the sun, and workers spray dry ice and water.Source: AP
