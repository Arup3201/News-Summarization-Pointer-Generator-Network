With the clocks going back, the nights drawing in and leaves turning brown, Britain has taken on a particularly autumnal feel in recent days, despite temperatures hitting an unseasonably high 17C.

And there was perhaps nowhere better to experience the changing season than in Buttermere in the Lake District today, where although temperatures were a slightly more wintry 12C, the fells were bathed in sunshine and took on a glorious golden glow, reflected in the still waters of the famous lake.

However, further south the picture was less bright, with much of the south subjected to showers leaving tourists visiting Windsor Great Park reaching for their umbrellas.

Much of the UK was again unseasonably mild, with temperatures reaching 16 or 17C in many parts of the country, and the north enjoying bright sunshine, despite the band of drizzly rain hanging over the south.

October has been one of the hottest since records began in 1659, and temperatures on Friday could reach a record Halloween high of 21C as families continue to enjoy a warm half term.

Met Office figures show October’s average temperature is 12.4C, 1.6C above normal, in central England, the region enclosed by the Thames, Lancashire and Bristol - covering close to half of England’s population including London, Birmingham and Manchester.

History: The name Buttermere is thought to mean 'the lake by the dairy pastures', a reference to the fertile land surrounding the water

Looking bright: Although temperatures around Buttermere were a slightly more wintry 12C today, the fells were bathed in sunshine

Surroundings: Buttermere is surrounded by fells, notably the High Stile range to the south west of the lake, Robinson to the north east, Fleetwith Pike and Wainwright favourite Haystacks in the south east and Grasmoor in the north west.

A temperature of 12.5C would rank this month in the top 10 hottest since 1659. The hottest October ever recorded is 2001’s 13.3C.

The Met Office has forecast an 'unseasonable' highs of 19C for tomorrow and up to 21C in the south on Friday, breaking the October 31 temperature record of 19.4C, set in Margate, Kent, in 1968. Even further north in Manchester the Mercury is set to hit 20C.

And while tomorrow will start with rain in Scotland and drizzle elsewhere, some sunshine is expected to break through in the south east. 

Moving into the evening, it will be a dry night in the south-east with some clear skies, but cloudier elsewhere and more patchy rain in the west with heavier rain in north west Scotland.

Warmer weather: Much of the UK was  unseasonably mild today, with temperatures reaching 16 or 17C in many parts of the country

Unseasonably mild: October has been one of the hottest since records began in 1659, and temperatures on Friday could reach a record Halloween high of 21C as families continue to enjoy a warm half term

Time for a getaway: Domestic tourism spending during half-term week is expected to be around £2billion, according to visitor spending data, with the bumper takings stemming from the warmer weather

Outlook: A band of rain will move east on Saturday, clearing to sunny spells from the west and temperatures again hitting 19C

Any early cloud across England and Wales will clear on Friday to leave a dry and very warm day with hazy spells of sunshine. Scotland and Northern Ireland will be cloudier with drizzle,  replaced by heavier rain in the west later in the day.

A band of rain will move east on Saturday, clearing to sunny spells from the west and temperatures again hitting 19C, although there will be showers on Sunday.  

Domestic tourism spending during half-term week is expected to be around £2billion, according to visitor spending data, with the bumper takings stemming from the warmer weather.

Scenery: The classic combination of lakes and mountains has made this spot popular with visitors to the Lake District

Pleasant stroll: The lake is one-and-a-half miles long, three-quarters of a mile wide, and can be navigated on foot in under three hours

Red sky at night: As the sun went down this evening, the firey red sky was reflected in the waters of Buttermere

The average daily spend by British staycationers is £156million on day visits and £66m on overnight trips - and there are significant increases during holiday periods, according to data from VisitEngland and VisitScotland.

'We’re very busy, with an influx of visitors due to good weather coinciding with half-term,' said Visit Brighton.  

Met Office forecaster Laura Young said: 'October has been mild with good sunshine, particularly in the South - and with unseasonable temperatures at the moment.

Admiring the view: People stop on a bridge over the River Garry to view the autumn scene near Killiecrankie in Scotland today

'Thursday could see 19C, with 20C to 21C on Friday in London and the east coast, with 20C in the South-West and maybe even in Manchester. Saturday could see 19C, with 17C on Sunday.'

Weather Channel forecaster Leon Brown said: 'We’re on track for the warmest Halloween since records began, with temperatures widely 18-20C and no doubt of 21C in some spots in eastern England.'

Rachel Vince, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the warmer weather would continue into November, although many areas will be blighted by rain.

A very Long Walk in this weather: Umbrellas were needed by those exploring Windsor Castle in Berkshire today

Grim down south: It rained for much of the day in the south, although temperatures were still warmer than average

‘In terms of temperature it's going to be average or above average throughout November,' she said.

‘The actual weather will be unsettled. It's typical autumnal weather which will be windy and rainy at times with some warm spells as well. Changeable is the best way to describe it.’

She added: ‘The cold will start to move in over the next few days to western and northern parts which will bring temperatures down, especially in the North and Scotland, which will feel much colder as temperatures drop down to about 10C (50F).

‘The UK has been mild for much of the month and 2014 could turn out to be one of the hottest years on record. Temperatures have often been above the norm.’ 

Forecast: The warmer weather is likely to continue into November, although many areas will be blighted by rain

Looking forward: The Met Office has forecast an 'unseasonable' highs of 19C for tomorrow and up to 21C in the south on Friday
