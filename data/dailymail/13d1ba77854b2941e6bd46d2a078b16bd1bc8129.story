FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke has claimed UEFA and most of the confederations want December 23 as the date for the Qatar 2022 World Cup final - but that no decision has been made and no compensation will be paid.

A FIFA task force on Tuesday recommended that the 2022 tournament should be played in late November to late December to avoid the heat of the summer.

The Premier League and Football Association say a final that close to Christmas will cause havoc with the traditional festive club programme and will campaign for an earlier final date ahead of the decision by FIFA's executive committee on March 20.

FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke said a December 23 final for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is supported by UEFA and the majority of the confederations, but a decision will be made in March

Valcke also ruled out compensation for leagues who lose out with the schedule saying the already get a cut of what FIFA makes out of the World Cup

December 18 remains a strong possibility - it is Qatar's national day and also falls on a Sunday, and would be early enough for the festive club programme to take place.

Valcke also confirmed that the 2022 World Cup will be four days shorter as a 'concession' to the league and clubs, 28 days instead of the usual 32, and that the African Nations Cup in 2023 will be moved to June from January.

He also said no apology was necessary to the clubs despite the disruption it will cause to domestic football across the globe. He also ruled out paying compensation - European Clubs' Association (ECA) chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Tuesday said the clubs would demand financial settlements for the disruption.

Valcke told a news conference in Doha after a Qatar 2022 organising committee board meeting: 'It's not perfect, we know that - but why are we talking about compensation? It's happening once we're not destroying football.

'Why should we apologise to the clubs? We have had an agreement with the clubs that they are part of the beneficiaries. It was 40 million (US) dollars in 2010 and 70 million in 2014.

'We are bringing all our people to enjoy the sporting and financial results of the World Cup.

'I definitely don't feel I have to apologise for the decision made yesterday to confirm that the World Cup will not be played in the summer.'

He added: 'Most confederations say they want the World Cup to end on the 23rd of December.'

Valcke also appeared to confirm the deal to extend the USA TV rights deal with Fox to include the 2026 World Cup had been done to avert the threat of any legal action over its 2022 deal.

He said: 'We have done what we had to do in order to protect FIFA and the organisation of the World Cup.'

Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore expressed disappointment at the proposed schedule for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar

We are extremely disappointed with the FIFA Task Force recommendation to move the 2022 FIFA World Cup to a November and December schedule.

It is clear that the views of the European leagues, along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected, have not been given serious consideration throughout this process.

The prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the 2022 World Cup significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions.

Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game’s great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and New Year fixture programme that season.

Clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further, but first we will consult with our clubs, other stakeholders in English football, and other leagues before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate or worthwhile.

Meanwhile Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan said there was no surprise in the decision to stage a winter World Cup in Qatar but that the actual timing could be crucial.

Regan told Press Association Sport: 'We have been expecting this decision for some time, but it is going to run late into December and just how close to Christmas it gets is something that needs to be thought through.

'We will look at the knock-on effects of the decision and how it will affect Scottish football - clearly there will be fixture challenges for leagues across the world.'

On Tuesday, FA chairman Greg Dyke told Press Association Sport: 'We will have to wait to hear the detail but we will try to protect all the traditional Christmas dates.'

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who was on the task force that met in Doha on Tuesday, added: 'Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game's great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and new year fixture programme that season.'

When will the 2022 World Cup in Qatar run?

The exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ‘late November to late December’ 2022 has been recommended by FIFA’s task force, with Saturday November 26 to Friday December 23 mooted as a possible 28-day slot. A final decision is expected on March 20.

A World Cup final near to Christmas sounds crazy...

It would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time. There is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier, perhaps on Sunday December 18, which is also Qatar National Day.

What’s the problem with having an earlier final?

Whenever it’s played, domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare. Typically this run-up period is a month. It will need to be a minimum of two weeks. A World Cup ending on December 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early November. Any earlier and football might have to stop as early as October.

What happens to the 2022-23 Premier League season?

Two months of club football will be ‘displaced’, and if the period cleared for the World Cup is as mooted, that will essentially be November and December. That would mean 10 Premier League games and three Champions League games being played earlier or later. So, for example, the Premier League season may have to start a month earlier (mid-July 2022) and finish a month later (mid-June 2023). The seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this. There will be disruption, to about 50 leagues, for about three years.

What about the Football League?

Club football across England would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the World Cup as FIFA insist on a ‘blackout’ of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece.

How will the fixture congestion affect domestic action?

FA Cup replays could be one victim for at least a season. Premier League clubs might play fewer League Cup games. Some European competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled. The Africa Cup of Nations due for January 2023 may have to be shelved.

Will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket?

Almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday-season bonanza of capacity crowds, but also untold millions if TV companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons. Arguably hardest hit will be smaller Football League clubs, reliant on turnstile cash, who are forced to go without games — and income — for weeks.

What do Sky and BT Sport think?

Both broadcasters declined to comment. But by 2022-23, we will be two more Premier League TV deals down the line after the £5billion extravaganza just agreed. Who knows who will have UK live rights then? Maybe beIN Sports… based in Qatar!

You’re not serious?

That’s what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in December 2010 that Qatar would host 2022. Rule out nothing, no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous.

Is there any chance this ALL won’t even happen?

Very little. And when FIFA announce a world-record sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways later this year, as insiders expect, none at all. Merry Christmas!
