When they go on sale later this year, Google Glass, the search giant's £1,000 wearable computer, is expected to become a common sight.

However, one web site has imagined what historical figures from Abraham Lincoln to Inspector Poirot would look like wearing the gadgets.

It comes as the gadget hits its first problem - being banned in a San Diego bar months before it even goes on sale.

Web site The Verge launched the idea, creating several of its own mockups and asking readers to contribute more.

Opinions are already divided on those seen wearing the glasses in public.

Google employees wearing then in San Francisco have been dubbed 'Glassholes' by locals, while in San Diego the 5 Point Café posted a sign for its patrons this week reading that 'a** kickings will be encouraged for violators' of their new rule banning them.

Bar owner Dave Meinert says his decision is done half-jokingly for a reaction but half for privacy as well.

'Part of this is a joke, to be funny on Facebook, and get reaction,' he told KIRO-FM.

'But part of it’s serious, because we don’t let people film other people or take photos unwanted of people in the bar, because it is kind of a private place that people go.'
