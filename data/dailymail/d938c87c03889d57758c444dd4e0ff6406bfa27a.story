A four-month-old baby is fighting for his life after his drug addict parents fed him crystal meth to stop him from crying 

Silvia Strnadova, 26, and husband Miroslav, 30, took the unconscious child to hospital but he was left brain dead and is only being kept alive by a life support machine.

The parents from the town of Prievidza in the north-western Slovak region of Horna Nitrawere were arrested after police discovered that they had given the infant a strong dose of the potent drug.

A hospital spokesman said: 'They came into the waiting room with the unconscious baby in a pram and demanded to see a doctor.

'When we carried out checks it became apparent the child was in a critical state and had been given a strong dosage of drugs.'

Head doctor Anna Moracikova added: 'The child's brain is severely damaged and he is clinically dead. His chances of survival are minimal and he is being kept alive by a life support machine.'

The drug crystal meth - made notorious by the popular US drama Breaking Bad - is a powerful stimulant known for its fast and long-lasting effects.

It delivers a euphoric high, but has deeply unpleasant side effects and is dangerously addictive. It can keep users awake for days, followed by a severe come-down.

Referred to as ‘ice’ or ‘glass’, crystal meth - a form of methylamphetamine - can be consumed orally, sniffed, smoked or injected.

In its most popular crystalline form it resembles glass shavings or a crystal rock but is also available in pills and powder. 

Across the US, where there are thought to be a million users, before and after pictures of users are often used to emphasise its ravaging effects, such as tooth decay. 

Across Europe, seizures of methamphetamine have increased from 30kg in 2000 to 1,582kg in 2011. 

Neighbours reacted with shock at the news but say the pair were well-known for their drug abuse.

Jana Trznikova, 36, said: 'Really weird people kept going to their apartment. I always worried about letting my children play outside because you never knew what would happen.

'She's well-known for not settling down and already has two other children with different men.

'He was known locally as the Crocodile on the drug scene, with a reputation for being the best crystal meth cooker, and because of his bad temper and the fact that he was dangerous.'

Social workers have also come under fire over their failure to take the child away from the pair.

Ms Trznikova said: 'They should never have been allowed to keep that poor baby.'

A police spokesman said: 'The man admitted giving the baby the meths in order to stop him crying. He has been arrested for neglect and for causing harm to a minor. 

That may change if the child dies. He is in custody, while the woman has for the time being been released. We are still investigating her for failing to stop her partner giving the child the drug.'
