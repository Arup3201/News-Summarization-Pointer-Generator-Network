Sports Direct has raced to the rescue of collapsed fashion chain Republic snapping up 116 stores, saving 2,100 jobs.

It is the latest distressed acquisition by the downturn-busting retailer controlled by founder Mike Ashley.

Earlier this week he released an eye-watering £100million fortune by selling down some of his stake in the business he floated in 2007.

Snapped up: Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has moved in on Republic, which collapsed earlier this month

Collapse: The Republic brand has gone bust but Mr Ashley has now saved 116 retail stores and 2,100 jobs along with its head office in Leeds, its websites and brands

Insiders say the share sale was unconnected to the Republic deal which was a transaction conducted by Sports Direct.

Sports Direct (up 3p to 417.5p) has already invested in Sir Tom Hunter’s Cruise fashion chain and bought 20 JJB Sports stores and stock as it seeks to diversify into fashion.

The firm said it had struck a deal with administrator Ernst & Young to acquire the bulk of the Republic stores, the head office in Leeds, stock, as well as Republic’s website and own brands. These include SoulCal, Fabric and Crafted.

It declined to give any details about future plans for the business.

New deal: Mike Ashley, whose biggest brand is Sports Direct, has a track record of investing in or buying stores and stock from ailing businesses

Republic, which employed 2,500 staff in 123 stores, collapsed earlier this month and administrators closed five shops in Scotland making 97 employees redundant and cast off 49 workers in Ireland from two stores.

Reclusive billionaire Mike Ashley was a keen squash player whose injury sent him into retail, leading him to create one of Britain's most successful companies.

Ranked as the 15th richest person in Britain with a £1.5bn fortune, he rarely gives interviews and is only seen publicly when watching Newcastle United, the football club he owns.

At 24 he married Swedish born economist Linda, who he had three children with. They divorced in 2003, agreeing a £50m deal, one of the biggest settlements in British history.

He left school at 16, became a squash coach after a bad injury ended his career, launched a sports and ski shop in Maidenhead in the 1980s and within a decade he had more than 100 UK stores.

Now his Sports Direct brand has 400 stores, but he also owns brands like Dunlop Slazenger, Karrimor, Kangol, Lonsdale, and a stake in Umbro.

Ashley also has a large stake in Blacks Leisure, the owner of Millets and is believed to own parts of JJB Sports and JD Sports.

Having exposure to all these brands and shops is how he has made so much money, with experts saying his aggressive management style means 'he likes to park his tanks on peoples' lawns'.

The private equity backed firm had been chaired by former Asda boss Andy Bond until a week before it failed.

The sizable stakes of founders Tim Whitworth and Carl Brewins are thought to have been lost.

Whitworth started-out as a Saturday boy in 1985 at what was then known as Just Jeans. The small retailer changed its name to Best Jeanswear in 1990 and became Republic in 1998.

In 2005 private equity firm Change Capital, which counts former Marks & Spencer chairman Luc Vandevelde and chief executive Roger Holmes on its board, took a stake to help grow the chain.

In 2011 TPG snapped it up for £300million, appointing former TK Maxx boss Paul Sweetenham as chief executive while Whitworth gave up day-to-day control.

In January accountant KPMG was brought in to try to rescue the chain after sales fell off a cliff during the Christmas period.

Its young customers have been hit hard by the downturn but the firm, which is predominantly based in the north of England, has also been slow to join rivals with a meaningful website.

It came as the true scale of the devastation wreaked on the British High Street was laid bare yesterday as it was revealed that the number of store closures skyrocketed last year.

A total of 7,300 High Street shops closed down in 2012, a net loss of 1,800 - compared with just 174 the year before.

While most attention was focussed on the
troubles of a few high-profile firms, the real damage was done by 
profitable businesses seeking to cut costs by trimming the number of 
stores.

A new report on Britain's 500 largest town centres by PwC and the Local Data Company showed that an average of 20 stores closed every day.

Success: Sports Direct's share price is up a pound in six months - but down slightly today - as they continue to hoover up failing businesses and turn them round

Crisis: High Street vacancies have remained strikingly high since the start of the recession

Desolate: Britain's High Streets had 1,800 fewer stores at the end of last year as businesses shut down outlets

The squeeze on High Street chains is of course closely linked to the double-dip recession, but they are also under pressure from the relentless rise of online shopping.

Last year saw well-known businesses such as Comet and JJB Sports cease operations, but even healthy firms closed branches in an attempt to keep costs down.

However, there was a surprising increase in the number of independent shops, with 600 more appearing over the course of the year to take advantage of large chains' struggles.
