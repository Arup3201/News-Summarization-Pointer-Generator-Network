A four-year-old autistic boy who went missing in Florida has been found in a hotel after SWAT teams surrounded it to arrest his a man thought to be his father on suspicion of the murder of four people.

Police had been searching for 28-year-old Adam Matos, after they went to check on Ismael Tristan Santisteban in the Tampa-area on Thursday after he was last seen a week ago.

Deputies had gone to the house that day on a domestic call involving Matos.

SWAT teams swarmed the Floridian Hotel in Tampa and arrested Adam Matos. An Amber Alert for his son was issued Thursday after officers checking on the child found four bodies piled up on each other near his house in Hudson, on the Gulf Coast.

When they arrived at the house in Hudson, they found nobody home but were overpowered by a bad smell.

They followed it down the street towards an area where birds were beginning to circle and found four bodies piled on top of each other.

Matos became a suspect after he had been seen in the area and police tracked him down to a Tampa hotel yesterday.

When SWAT teams arrested him, taking him into custody, they then found the boy, who was said to be uninjured and is now in good spirits.

Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor told CBS News that Matos was found on the 18th floor of the hotel and police had to use a ruse to get him to leave the room.

She added that prior to that he had been seen at different bus stops in the downtown area and may have been inquiring about buying a bus ticket.

While at the hotel, it is said Matos used his own name to check into the hotel around midnight. 

Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the killings were not a random act.

Officials have not released the names of the victims or said how they may be related to the boy and to Matos.

The investigation is continuing and multiple charges are pending.
