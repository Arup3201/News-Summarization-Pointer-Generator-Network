A nun who planned to put up a 24ft high illuminated cross in her garden to stand as a symbol of 'hope' for neighbours has been thwarted by planners.

Sister Mary Michael, 68, had intended to use the giant cross for three hours of daily prayers at her modest bungalow in North Hykeham, Linconshire.

But planning officials have rejected the nun's proposals and described the planned Christian symbol as 'inappropriate'.

North Kesteven District Council agreed with neighbours who had complained about the LED-lit cross, saying it would 'have a harmful visual impact'.

The 68-year-old has said she is disappointed but has no plans to fight the decision: 'You can't fight the council. I think the Devil is a bit easier really.

Sister Mary included an example of what the illuminated cross would have looked like in her application to the council

'I thought it would be lovely for people,' she added.

Sister Mary planned to hold daily prayer meetings with fellow worshipers at her rented bungalow in the quiet cul-de-sac.

However, her initial planning application attracted widespread opposition from nearby residents with 19 formal objections lodged with the local authority.

And even an anti-light pollution group - the Campaign for Dark Skies - objected to the proposed lighting on the cross.

The proposed cross would have towered over the nun's property - but the application has hit a brick wall after being rejected by planners

Sister Mary had planned for the cross to stand as a 7.38m replica of the enormous 'Glorious Cross of Dozule'.

But as well as facing problems with planners, the nun also appeared to have funding difficulties after only managing to raise £20 towards the cost of the cross which would have towered over her home.

A neighbour who voiced concerns about the giant cross said she had no objections to the Christian symbol but was concerned about the LED-illumination.

Betty Snell, whose property backs on to the proposed site of the cross, said: 'I object to it because of the height and the fact that it will be illuminated.

Sister Mary hit the headlines when she protested against movie The Da Vinci Code by holding a 12 hour 
vigil with Gerard Fox, 31, infront of Lincoln Cathedral where scenes 
from the film were shot

A spokesman for the Diocese of Nottingham has described Sister Mary Michael as a 'one-woman order'

'The fact it is a religious symbol is irrelevant, it is the size of it and that it will be lit up.'

In the notice refusing planning permission, the local council went on to say the cross would 'represent an...intrusive feature within (a) wholly residential area.'

Sister Mary also hit the headlines in 2006 after travelling from Lincolnshire to the Cannes Film Festival to protest at the premiere of the movie The Da Vinci Code.

She attracted international attention for the protest and also appeared in the world's media after kneeling on the steps of Lincoln Cathedral as the movie was being filmed inside.

She claims to belong to Our Lady’s Community of Peace and Mercy in Lincoln. But the Roman Catholic Church has said Sister Mary is not ‘canonically recognised’ even if she does do ‘good works’.

She is known to have spent three years with a closed Carmelite order in Cornwall, but decided to continue wearing a slightly modified habit despite no longer being a fully-fledged nun.

A spokesman for the Diocese of Nottingham, in which she lives, said she was now a ‘maverick’ and a ‘one-woman order’.
