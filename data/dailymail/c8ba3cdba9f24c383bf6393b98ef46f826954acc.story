Max Verstappen will become the youngest ever Formula One driver when the 16-year-old joins Toro Rosso next season.

The Dutchman, who is the son of former F1 driver Jos, is 17 next month and will make the step up from Formula Three to replace Jean-Eric Vergne.

Verstappen said: ‘Since I was seven years old, Formula One has been my career goal, so this opportunity is truly a dream come true.’

Verstappen was described as ‘one of the most skilled young drivers of the new generation’ by Toro Rosso team principal Franz Tost, who added: ‘We believe he has the necessary maturity and mental strength to take on this challenge successfully.

‘This year he has already demonstrated how well he can cope under difficult conditions.’

However, former McLaren assistant team manager Tony Jardine has warned the experienced drivers will not be happy to line up alongside a teenager on the grid.

‘What will the senior drivers think about it? Don’t ask them because they won’t like it,’ Jardine said.

‘In the Netherlands, the age is 18 to get your driving licence, so it is going to be a huge story.’ Verstappen, though, clearly has the confidence to deal with his big challenge.

‘I’m not that worried about it,’ he said. ‘The cars are really safe. I think it’s more dangerous to bike through a big city than race in an F1 car.’

Red Bull, Toro Rosso’s sister team, have a good record of promoting young drivers, with Sebastian Vettel, Jaime Alguersuari and Daniel Ricciardo all having made the switch from the junior outfit.

Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton has likened his drivers’ championship battle with fellow Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg to a game of poker.

Hamilton is just 11 points behind Rosberg — who leads the championship on 202 — with eight races to go, the pair having opened up a sizeable lead on the rest of the field.

‘When I was racing against Kimi Raikkonen (in 2007) and Felipe Massa (in 2008), they were in a different team and their cars had different strengths and weaknesses to my car,’ Hamilton said.

‘Now I’m racing against a guy who has the same car as me — we both have access to the same data and feedback.

‘It’s a bit like playing poker — you have a set of cards and the other guy is not supposed to know what you’ve got, but Nico and I can see each other’s cards, so it’s more difficult to beat each other.’
