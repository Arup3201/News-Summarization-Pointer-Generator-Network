Demonstrators started a seven-day march from Ferguson to the Missouri governor's mansion in Jefferson City this morning to protest the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Crowds gathered for a prayer service before driving to the site where Brown was killed then peacefully walking through the streets singing, stopping occasionally to stage 'die-ins'.

Meanwhile dozens of protesters stormed in department stores, streets and parking lots chanting 'black lives matter'. 

The 120-mile march to Gov Jay Nixon's property in Jefferson City will take seven days and was organized by the NAACP.

Journey for justice: Demonstrators start a seven-day march from Ferguson to the Missouri governor's mansion in Jefferson City to protest the grand jury decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson 

Effort: Hundreds are expected to join as they take on the 120-mile route, covering 10 miles every day. A group walk past a store front burnt during the violence 

'Don't shoot': Many put their hands-up, a gesture that has dominated protests around the country since the August shooting

Leading figure: NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks (centre) joins the marchers from Canfield 

Die-ins: Demonstrators have staged a second day of die-ins across Ferguson to shut down businesses

Organizers say the purpose is to call for new leadership in the Ferguson police department and for police reforms in the St Louis suburb and throughout the U.S. 

Each evening along the route, marchers will participate in what they call 'teach-ins' and rallies. 

Organizers say people are welcome to join in as they please.

Protesters upset by the grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson, Missouri, officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown have disrupted shopping in suburban St Louis for the second straight day.

Fast food restaurant Buffalo Wild Wings was forced to close after dozens of people lay in the front court with their fists in the air, chanting 'no justice, no wings'. 

They marched through a Trader Joe's store in Brentwood, about 10 miles south of Ferguson, at around noon and later made their way through Saks.

After leaving they briefly blocked Eager Road near Interstate 170.

On Friday, three St Louis-area malls were briefly shut down due to demonstrations. 

Protest organizers planned to meet later Saturday to consider other plans for the coming days. 

As the march began, Gov Nixon called for the state legislature to meet and discus 'critical funding' following violent protests in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown.

According to CNN, $4million is currently set aside every year for the state's National Guard response, but it is unclear how much money he is seeking. 

In Chicago, Rev. Jesse Jackson joined a road blocking protest on Saturday and urged federal authorities to investigate the Ferguson shooting. He then joined a similar demonstration in Portland, Oregon, 2,120 miles away.

According to The Oregonian, Jackson said that even though Portland is overwhelmingly white, it shares an ugly trait with Ferguson.

'Blacks are profiled and arrested disproportionately to the larger population,' he said.

Hundreds of people interrupted holiday shopping at major retailers around the country to protest a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot the 18-year-old protesters dubbed the day 'Brown Friday' or 'Blackout Black Friday'. 

The route: Protesters joining the march will cover more than 120 miles in seven days

Start: The march began at Canfield Drive in Ferguson - where Michael Brown was shot - on Saturday and will go through various Missouri communities until they reach Jefferson City 

Emotional: Emotions were running high at the service before driving to the site where Michael Brown died

Prayer service: Members of the NAACP held hands with marchers in prayer before heading out to walk

The congregation sang hymns and heard speeches before starting on the 120-mile trek to Jefferson City

Numerous storefronts in the Ferguson area still have their windows covered with plywood after the looting and violence in the immediate aftermath of the grand jury announcement Monday. 

But many merchants added spray-painted messages indicating that they were open ahead of Small Business Saturday. 

In San Francisco crowds used hammers to smash the windows of stores in the city's touristy Union Square.

Demonstrators temporarily shut down three large malls in suburban St. Louis on one of the busiest shopping days of the year and then marched in front of the Ferguson police department.

Several stores lowered their security doors or locked entrances as at least 200 protesters sprawled onto the floor while chanting, 'Stop shopping and join the movement,' at the Galleria mall in Richmond Heights a few miles south of Ferguson, Missouri, where Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown, who was unarmed, in August.

The action prompted authorities to close the mall for about an hour Friday afternoon, while a similar protest of about 50 people had the same effect at West County Mall in nearby Des Peres. 

End point: After the seven-day march, the protesters will end at Governor Jay Nixon's mansion in Jefferson City

Chanting: Crowds chanted 'black lives matter' and 'don't shoot' in a St Louis mall for the second day running

Disruption: They took drums to beat as they slowly made their way through on Small Business Da

'Hands up': The crowds made reference to the fact that Michael Brown allegedly died with his hands up

And several dozen demonstrators led to a temporary closure of the Chesterfield Mall.

Later on Friday night, a group of about 100 protesters marched down West Florissant Avenue Florissant in front of the city's police and fire departments chanting, blocking traffic and stopping in front of some businesses.

'I served my country. I spent four years in the Army, and I feel like that's not what I served my country for,' said Ebonie Tyse, 26, of St. Louis. 'I served my country for justice for everyone. Not because of what color, what age, what gender or anything,' she said.

Fifteen people were arrested, according to Missouri Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike O'Connell.

He said charges would include peace disturbance and impeding the flow of traffic, and two people would be charged with resisting arrest and one with assault. 

Marching: Police trailed the group as they moved through the city chanting and lying on the ground

The peaceful protest is one of many across the US following the grand jury's refusal to indict Officer Wilson

Protesters in Seattle clashed with authorities and police said they used pepper spray against demonstrators and claimed that some demonstrators were throwing flares.

At least five people were arrested, according to authorities. 

Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., attended a prayer vigil Friday night in Miami Gardens, Florida. 

He met with Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, whose 17-year-old son Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer.

Tracy Martin told Miami television station WFOR he offered Michael Brown Sr. encouragement and told him 'God has his hands on the situation, and he's gonna be OK.'

The vigil was part of the annual Gospel Explosion Concert hosted by rapper Flo Rida.

The U.S. Justice Department has its own investigation into possible civil rights violations that could result in federal charges for Wilson, but investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof. 

The federal agency also has launched a broad investigation into the Ferguson Police Department.
