Kevin Pietersen’s much anticipated autobiography is published on Monday and English cricket waits to see the extent of his score-settling at the end of a chequered international career.

Yet KP seems intent on avoiding difficult questioning, with no press conference planned for the cricketing media and one-on-one interviews being refused, even to the likes of respected BBC correspondent Jonathan Agnew.

Here, cricket correspondent Paul Newman asks the questions that, with respect to Graham Norton and the presenters of Blue Peter, he is unlikely to face.

Why have you fallen out throughout your career with significant people wherever you have played — a pattern that began in your native South Africa, carried on in English club cricket with Cannock and continued at Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and, it is suggested now, Surrey? 

Most significantly, of course, there is England. Andy Flower, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Peter Moores and Matt Prior, to name but five, are all good, team-oriented people who have the best interests of English cricket very much in their hearts. Can they all be wrong and you be right? Why is it always you?

And just what has happened at Surrey? 

The bottom line is that you have been released and there is very little prospect of you playing at The Oval next year. 

Yet a magnificent piece of spinning in a Pietersen-friendly paper last week suggested that it is all a ploy to dash the hopes of the bad old ECB to fine you. 

Pull the other one, Kevin. If you had scored more runs or shown any enthusiasm for county cricket, maybe played the odd first-class match, your argument that you want to play for England again would have some substance.

As it is, it seems even your old mentor Graham Ford has been frustrated at your lack of desire to work at your batting this year.

And what about the suggestion that you have somehow won the ‘PR battle’ this season? 

If so, why did large sections of the sell-out crowd at Edgbaston for Twenty20 finals day roundly boo you while treating your old adversary Andrew Flintoff, for instance, as a returning hero?

More pertinently, Cook has had complete support at every ground he has played throughout the summer, most notably at the Ageas Bowl where he received standing ovations when he went out to bat and when he was undefeated in the 40s at lunch. 

Yes, there was sympathy in January at the way it all ended for a player who touched greatness but that was quickly dissipated by your willingness to allow Piers Morgan to be your mouthpiece. You sitting there with Morgan at Lord’s while he tweeted about Cook being ‘a weasel’ was a low point.

Sportsmail revealed Pietersen sent derogatory messages to South African opponents about Andrew Strauss

The biggest question, of course, is Sportsmail’s revelation from 2012 that you sent derogatory messages to South African opponents about your captain Andrew Strauss. Why on earth did you do that? 

And why, if they were just ‘banter’ between old friends, have you consistently refused to show them to the ECB ever since or properly to apologise for your actions? 

That really should have been the end of the road with England for you, we all know that now, but then we would have been denied your incredible century in Mumbai that went a long way towards securing an historic series win in India. 

That’s the thing, you see Kevin, there’s always that contradiction and frustration with you.

Your relationship with England fell apart during that 2012 summer and your behaviour during and after the Headingley Test was bizarre to say the least. You went out of your way to mix with the South Africans on the field in training and at intervals rather than your team-mates.

You did not acknowledge the applause from the England dressing room when you scored a century — another world-class knock, by the way — and then there was the dressing room incident involving James Taylor. 

A glum-looking Pietersen has been a controversial figure for England on and off the cricket pitch

What did you say behind his back that so annoyed your team-mates? Why did you say ‘it’s tough being me’ after that game? And while we are at it what did you say about Michael Carberry behind his back in the Sydney dressing room as England crumbled to that 5-0 Ashes thrashing? 

You had a horrible habit of undermining inexperienced team-mates when the going got tough.

It is widely understood that Cook played a huge part in convincing the ECB to take you back after the text scandal but what is not as well documented is that it was mainly Flower who persuaded England to give you another chance. 

Pietersen has had a chequered international past and his autobiography may include a spot of score-settling

Pietersen had his feuds with Andy Flower, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Peter Moores and Matt Prior

Are you really going to make Flower the No 1 target in your book after all he did for you — and more importantly, for England?

You wanted him sacked along with Moores in 2008, a move that was to catastrophically backfire. 

Why did you feel so strongly that Moores and Flower had to go? Flower still worked with you and managed you after that and then agreed to have you back in 2012 even though he felt personally let down by your betrayal of Strauss. It is difficult to see how he has wronged you.

Let’s go back to one of the most controversial episodes in recent cricket history, the Allen Stanford affair. To be fair, you conducted yourself as England captain as well as could be hoped as the team were effectively hired out to a crooked Texan. 

Much was made of the winner-takes-all aspect of the week in Antigua and we all know the England players won nothing while the Stanford team walked off with a million dollars each.

It is not as well documented that Flower (right) persuaded England to give Pietersen another chance

But did you have a separate agreement with Stanford to promote the whole tawdry business? If so, did you hand back the money once it was found to be ill-gotten gains by Stanford? 

What did you think when Graeme Swann said in his autobiography that you were never the right man to captain England? And did you really think Swann and other England players like Stuart Broad were involved in that fake ‘KP genius’ Twitter account that seemed to offend you so much. 

What about when Swann said, after his retirement in Australia, that ‘some players are up their own backside’ and show a lack of humility? 

‘It will bite them on the a*** one day and when it does I hope they are embarrassed about how they carry on,’ Swann said about the unnamed player or players. Who do you think he was talking about?

Finally Kevin, why did you walk out of that last meeting with Cook and Paul Downton when they told you about your deselection, rather than hang around to hear the reasons and talk it through? 

Cook wanted to have a full discussion on where it had all gone wrong but you did not give him a chance, instead getting your mate Morgan to suggest Cook wouldn’t front up. 

The same cheerleader later misinterpreted the pivotal Melbourne team meeting and made groundless accusations about Matt Prior attacking Flower when you know he did nothing of the sort. Confidentiality agreement, anyone?

The fact is your departure has been horrible and nasty. There’s only one person to blame for that, Kevin. It’s not Flower, Cook, Strauss, Prior, Downton, Swann, Moores, Hugh Morris, Ali Bacher, Jason Gallian or anyone at Hampshire and Surrey. It’s you.
