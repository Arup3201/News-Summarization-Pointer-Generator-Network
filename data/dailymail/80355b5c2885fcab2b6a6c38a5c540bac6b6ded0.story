A military ship carrying 350 migrants has arrived in Sicily as anger erupts over the deaths of as many of 30 people who were found suffocated in the hold of a packed smugglers' boat.

The migrants were some of thousands trying to cross from North Africa over the weekend, Italy's Navy said.

The dead are thought to have either drowned or suffocated on the overcrowded fishing vessel, the navy said, who have spent the day rescuing families onboard.

The discovery on Sunday underlined the scale of the crisis in the waters of the southern Mediterranean, where hundreds have died making the perilous journey to Europe, and tens of thousands more have been plucked from rickety boats.

announced a plan to help Rome deal with the refuges and combat people 
smuggling.

More than 5,000 people were rescued this weekend, adding to the 50,000 migrants who have reached Italy from North Africa so far this year, many fleeing war and forced conscription.

Italy has called on its European Union partners to do more to help manage the near daily arrivals which have boosted support for the country's anti-immigration opposition Northern League party.

At the current rate, the figures should soon pass the record of 62,000 people who arrived by sea in 2011, when numbers swelled amid the 'Arab Spring' uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East.

An Italian ship, part of the navy's migrant rescue mission Mare Nostrum or "Our Sea", was due to arrive at the Sicilian port of Pozzallo later on Monday towing the fishing boat and carrying 566 survivors.

The navy said thousands of others rescued this weekend would arrive in other ports in southern Italy over Monday and Tuesday.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said last week the EU should take responsibility for rescuing boat migrants by investing in regional border control agency Frontex.

Northern League leader Matteo Salvini attacked Renzi and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano in a Facebook post:

He said: 'Thirty more deaths on the consciences of those who defend "Their Seas". Stop the departures, help them at home, now! Renzi and Alfano have blood on their shirts, don't they?'Â 

The Italian navy said the bodies were found in the bow area of the boat.

Overall during the weekend, the navy said it rescued more than 5,000 migrants, adding to the 60,000 people who have made their way to Italy since the beginning of the year, compared with 42,000 in all of 2013.

Most are African or Middle Eastern refugees who pay hundreds or thousands of euro apiece to smugglers in Libya who pack them into unsafe fishing vessels for the crossing. Officials say the numbers have swelled this year due to the increasing instability in Libya.

Italy improved its sea rescue operations last October after a migrant boat capsized off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, killing more than 360 people.

Italy has insisted that the European Union shoulder more of the cost and burden of the rescue operations and says it will use its upcoming EU presidency to press its case.
