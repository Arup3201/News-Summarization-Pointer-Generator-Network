Moussa Ibrahim was a fierce defender of the regime

The former spokesman of Muammar Gaddafi's government has been captured, exactly a year after the death of the Libyan dictator, the prime minister's office said on Saturday.

Moussa Ibrahim, who was the mouthpiece of the Gaddafi regime during last year's war, was caught in the town of Tarhouna, 70 km (40 miles) south of Tripoli.

'Moussa Ibrahim has been arrested by forces belonging to the Libyan government in the town of Tarhouna and he is being transferred to Tripoli to begin interrogation,' a statement from the prime minister's office said.

Mr Ibrahim was educated in Britain and spoke fluent English.

He would hold regular press conferences in the luxury Tripoli hotel were journalists stayed during last year's war.

He was a tireless defender of the regime, demanding journalists accompany him to Nato bomb sites.

His whereabouts have been unknown since the fall of Tripoli in August 2011 but there have been past reports of his capture.

Saturday marks one year since Gaddafi's capture and death in his hometown Sirte, after he was caught hiding in a drain pipe.

Videos circulated online in the days 
following the former Libyan leader's killing at the hands of 
revolutionary soldiers show them taunting and beating him before his 
execution.

Graphic footage 
showed how Gaddafi was dragged, wounded and bleeding, from the storm 
drain in which he had been hiding as rebel fighters rained blows down on
him, pulled him by his hair and kicked dust into his face.

The alleged capture came after claims that the dictator raped schoolboys and girls during his regime.

Colonel Gaddafi beat and raped 
kidnapped schoolgirls he used as sex slaves in between checking his 
emails, according to a new book.

French reporter Annick Cojean gathered horrific accounts from the girls forced into the former Libyan dictator's harem for the account published last week.
