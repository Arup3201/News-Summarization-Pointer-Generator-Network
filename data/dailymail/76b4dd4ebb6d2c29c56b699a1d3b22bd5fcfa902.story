She is unlikely to swap her chauffeur-driven car for the normal morning commute.

But just in case, the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was given one of London Underground's famous Baby On Board badges when she visited a bustling tube station today.

The lapel badges are available free to expectant mothers using public transport as a gentle hint to fellow travellers to offer them their seat and behave, well, in a slightly more courteous manner.

Laughing Kate, who was wearing an 
extremely short teal coat by designer Marlene Birger, which displayed 
her blossoming bump, a took the gesture in good spirits as she turned to
the Queen and said: 'I will have to wear it at home!'

The Duchess, who is expecting her 
first baby in July, was accompanying the sovereign on her first major 
engagement since she fell ill with a crippling bout of gastroenteritis 
almost three weeks ago.

The 86-year-old monarch looked paler 
and more drawn than normal but otherwise remarkably well in a cream 
'summer tweed' dress and coat by Karl Ludwig and an Angela Kelly hat.

Her trip to Baker Street station, just
yards from the birthplace of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, had 
been organised to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground.

It is third time that Kate has 
accompanied the Queen on a public engagement without her husband, Prince
William. Sources said there was 'no special reason' that the Queen had 
invited the Duchess to join her but just 'very much liked' to include 
her on occasions when their diaries allowed.

Accompanied by a sprightly looking 
Duke of Edinburgh, the two senior royal women arrived at 11.10am to the 
astonishment of passers-by and commuters alike.

It was clearly a good day to get a 
seat on the Metropolitan Line, as waiting travellers ignored the 
arriving trains in order to catch a glimpse of the royal party - and 
loudly booed each time one pulled into the station and blocked their 
view.

After meeting staff in the ticket 
hall, the Royal Party moved downstairs to Platform 1 - the 
Northern-bound Metropolitan Line - where they were invited to walk 
through a new S7 train which is being rolled out on the underground and 
boasts walk-through carriages and air conditioning. The Queen later 
unveiled a plaque, naming the train 'Queen Elizabeth II'.

Afterwards, much to the delight of the
Duke of Edinburgh, the group were invited to view a restored 1892 
'Jubilee' coach, the oldest operational carriage in the world, which was
variously used a shed and a shed and a workshop before being rescued by
London underground in 1974 and restored.

It is not the first time the Queen has
been on the London Underground - she first travelled on a tube at the 
age of 13 in May 1939 with her sister, Princess Margaret, and their 
governess.

And during the visit Kate revealed she had been an regular traveller on the tube until her marriage to the future king.

London Underground's chief operating 
officer Howard Collins who presented Kate with her 'Baby on Board!' 
badge, revealed: 'She told me "I used to use the tube on a regular 
basis". She doesn't travel on the tube now because of her new role, 
unfortunately.

Keeping warm: The five-months pregnant Duchess of Cambridge kept warm in a thick coat and black gloves

'She said she rather missed it and 
asked lots of questions about the new trains, particularly the air 
conditioning which she said would make it much more pleasant to travel 
in the summer.'

He added: 'She seemed delighted with her Baby On Board badge and said: 'Oh yes I've seen this before - how do they work?'.

'We have been issuing them for the 
last 10 years and I explained how fantastic they were and how they 
really do make a difference - saves men the embarrassment of having to 
guess if a woman is pregnant.

'She asked so many great questions of the staff and seemed really interested our work.'

The Queen did not leave empty handed 
either and was presented with a commemorative Oyster Card, to the cheers
of the waiting crowds.

Baker Street was part of the first 
stretch of the world-famous Tube network Paddington and Farringdon which
opened on January 9 1863.

As Kate's bump begins to show the Duchess is tending towards smart A-line jackets that flow over her stomach and allow for expansion as her pregnancy develops.

Today's Teal Marlene Birger dress coat was smart choice for the stylish royal, adding a pop of colour to a grey day in London and acting as proof that it is possible to dress stylishly without resorting to frumpy maternity wear.

Some traditionalists have raised their eyebrows at the hem lengths Kate has been sporting lately, but thick black opaque tights, black gloves and a glamorous hat kept the look formal.

Kate chose an elegant teal dress coat featuring black beaded detail and buttons and a flattering flared bac

Erica Davies, Fashion and Beauty Editor at Look magazine and a mummy blogger at Modern Mum Must-Have says: 'A-line is always going to be a flattering shape when you're pregnant because it works for every shape.

'So whatever your size, an A-line will skirt over the bump showing off knock-out legs and a slim top half.

'Kate would look great in maternity dresses from Koka Mama - versatile pieces that work hard as a tunic over trousers or as a dress. And as we all know, Kate isn't afraid to wear things twice.'

Danish designer Marlene Birger is known for her smart, elegant collections and coats from her new season line start at Â£369.

Kate has worn pieces by the established designer before, choosing a 'Bullet' dress as part of her coveted North American tour wardrobe in summer 2011.

Yesterday Kate's monochrome styling on a charity visit caused a sensation, the white Â£560 Goat coat that she chose proved particularly popular with her fans.

A spokesman for fashion site my-wardrobe.com who stock the design as part of their spring offering said: 'Our buyers are re-ordering more stock to land on the site soon. The other pieces from the collection are now also in our top selling categories.'
