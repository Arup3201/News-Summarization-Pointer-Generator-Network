A teenager has died after collapsing at a music festival promoting itself as ‘The UK’s Maddest City’.

The 18 year old woman was taken ill at the Boomtown Fair festival, near Winchester, Hampshire, on Friday night, but despite a swift response from paramedics, the teenager was pronounced dead upon on arrival at hospital.

Police are not treating the incident as suspicious, but social media users said a death at the festival, where £130,000 worth of drugs were seized last year, was ‘inevitable’.

Tragedy: The 18 year old woman died after she collapsed at Boomtown Fair festival in Hampshire on Friday night after what may have been a drug-overdose

The teenager’s family has been told of the tragedy at the festival site at Matterley Bowl, located near Winchester, police said tonight.

‘Boomtown Fair control team and on site emergency services were made aware of a woman in need of medical attention just after 10pm on Thursday, August 8,’ a Hampshire Police spokesman said.

‘On site medical services responded and an 18-year-old woman was taken to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester but was pronounced dead on arrival.

‘The death is not being treated as suspicious. The woman’s next of kin and the coroner have been informed.

‘Hampshire Constabulary is working with Boomtown Fair organisers to establish the circumstances around the death.’

Chemical controversy: Boomtown Fair, where last year, £130,000 worth of drugs were seized, has been described by its organisers ad the 'maddest town' in the UK

The young woman is believed to have travelled to the festival with a group of friends from outside the county to attend the four-day event, described as a ‘family friendly event’ where tickets cost up to £149.

A post mortem is yet to take place but police said drugs form one line of their enquiry.

Twitter was rife with speculation surrounding the young woman’s death, with many implying that drugs were involved.

Twitter user sashalouxo ‘Rip to the girl who died at boomtown last night. Everyone who does drugs should take note from this. Don’t risk your life for a buzz.’

Another user, JoeGodden12 tweeted: ‘Girl 18 died at boomtown though drugs and alcohol that’s nuts! ??’

Ak-Wharton wrote: ‘So someone has died at Boomtown. As sad as it is, that was inevitable.’

Officers are now ‘reinforcing drug warning messages’ at the festival which is expected to attract 30,000 people this weekend.

Boomtown Fair, headlined by Maximo Park, Mystery Jets, and Bob Marley’s son Julian, hosts ska and party bands from around the world, with 24 others offering cabaret, gypsy, folk, reggae, dub, and country and western.

On the fair’s official website, organisers describe the festival as the ‘UK’s Maddest City’.

In a review on another site, one fan wrote: ‘I want to be back in the land of Boomtown Fair, where drinking all day is encouraged, mechanical horses carry children through the crowds, the music is mad and the people are smiling.’

At last year's festival, an estimated £130,000 worth of drugs were seized by police, 121 people were dealt with for possession offences and 27 were arrested.
