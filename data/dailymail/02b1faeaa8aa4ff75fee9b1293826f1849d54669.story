They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but Bella the cocker spaniel is learning a new one each day for the next year.

The  three-year-old working dog has become an internet hit thanks to the daily feats that have earned her the nickname 'Paul Spaniels.'

The dog has so far mastered playing basket ball, rolling out a carpet, doing a handstand and emptying the washing machine.

Other tricks in her repertoire include kung fu moves, putting rubbish in the bin, making a bed and loading the dishwasher.

Her owner Lynn Stacey embarked on the 365 day trick challenge to raise money for Dog A.I.D.

Lynn, who uses a wheelchair to get around, relies on her talented assistance dog for help with daily tasks.

The pair have been together since Bella was born in June 2011 and from a young age started her training 

'You wouldn't believe what Bella can do, she's amazing,' said the owner from North Yorkshire.

 'From fetching me things, to helping me undress and emptying the washing machine. I'd be lost without her.'

'Bella is already a Champion Trick Dog and she loves doing her tricks so I thought, why not do a trick a day for a year?'

The 48-year-old uploads each of Bella's new tricks to her website and supporters are able to sponsor individual feat. 

 The challenges are also posted to YouTube and her dedicated Twitter account.

Before she started the challenge on January 1 this year, Bella could already perform 129 tricks as well as her assistance tasks.

'Some are very simple tricks, some are more complex,' said Lynn.

'She plays dead, does the meerkat where she stands on her back legs, and does a handstand on her front legs, all sorts of things.'

The owner, who has trained to become a Trick Dog Instructor, hopes Bella's extraordinary skills will raise £1,000 for Dog A.I.D., a charity that provides training to pet dog owners so they can turn their beloved pooch into a qualified Assistance Dog.

'Bella is at her best when she is learning, so adding tricks to her existing knowledge base made perfect sense.

'It has brought us closer as a working partnership and many of the tricks have a purpose in our everyday life as well.'
