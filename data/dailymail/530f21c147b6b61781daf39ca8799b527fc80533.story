There are no longer  four basic face shapes, with scientists identifying five new distinct shapes among Australian faces.

Dr Kendra Schmid, a leading facial recognition scientist, analysed over 1000 faces from different states across Australia, unmasking five new face shapes. 

New face shapes that were discovered are kite, rectangle, teardrop, heptagon and oblong in research conducted by Dr Kendra Schmid.

Before this research, more than half of Australians thought their face was oval, however, it has turned out that only 14 per cent actually have this shaped face.  

The most common face shape among Australia's is a new model, coined, 'Kite' (above). A study found 20.4 per cent of Australians have a kite shaped face

 The research, commissioned by OPSM Opticians, found that around one-third of Australians are unsure of their face shape, prompting the company to better understand the different shapes of individuals.

The most common face was a new  model, coined 'kite', which is found among 20.4 per cent of Australians. 

The second most common shape is the heart frame, which is a more traditional pre-existing shape among Australians.

Australian super model Miranda Kerr has a square shaped face. People with square shaped faces have an angular shape, where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal 

'Rarer types such as teardrop, heptagon and oblong, although reflecting a relatively small percentage of Australians of only 5 per cent each, all have very distinct features that set them apart form more common groups,' Dr Schmid told Daily Mail Australia.

She said that the most surprising discovery was the diversity in face shapes.

'I did not expect to find nine shapes that stood out so prominently,' she said. 'This was really the first study of its kind and so I was really surprised with the number of shapes.' 

Dr Schmid said that knowing your face shape is just as important as knowing your shoe size or clothing size. 

She said that this research helps Optometrists to 'better understand their customers and the type of frames that would suite them best'. 

'You go shopping for shoes and dresses knowing your size, so knowing your shape face also makes you feel and look your best', Dr Schmid said.

But Dr Schmid said a lot of people confuse their shape with existing models.

'An oval shape is very similar to a kite face but it has more even features like the forehead and jawline, which is more even in terms of length and curve,' she said.  

When asked whether there is one particular shape that is more attractive amongst others, Dr Schmid insisted that beauty was in the eye of the beholder.

'The measurements that we used for this research is just a small part to determine someone's attractiveness - any shape could be just as beautiful - the attractiveness is more about features and symmetry rather than the shape'.

But when it comes to models, Dr Schmid admits they tend to have a square shaped face. 

'They have a defined bone structure and everything is fairly in proportion'. 

Only 11 per cent of Australians have a square shaped face, among them is super model Miranda Kerr.

OPMS describes their characteristics as 'an angular face shape, where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal'.

Other Australian celebrities were put through a face analysis which found Kylie Minogue with a heart shaped face, Rose Byrne with an oval shaped face, and Cate Blanchett with a kite shaped face. 

Dr Schmid analysed 1000 Australian faces using image processing and point detection software. 

'I took measurements with the points and used something called cluster analysis which grouped people in their category', she said. 

#1 KITE: 20% of Australians 

Characteristics: Kite face shapes have prominent cheekbones, which are slightly wider than the mid and lower forehead. The kite face narrows at the jawline and the chin. 

#2 HEART: 20 % of Australians 

Characteristics: Heart faces have a longer and wider forehead, with cheekbones a similar width to the lower forehead. Hearts have a slightly more prominent jaw than kite shapes and narrow at the chin. 

#3 RECTANGLE: 16% of Australians

Characteristics: Rectangle faces are recognisable by their defined jaw line, of similar width to the cheekbone and lower forehead. 

#4 OVAL: 14% of Australians 

Characteristics: Ovals are typically smaller than average on all measures. Oval faces are widest at the cheekbone and narrow through the forehead and jaw. 

#5 ROUND: 11% of Australians 

Characteristics: Round faces have soft, balanced features, typically with a shorter face length and narrower cheek and jawline. 

#6 SQUARE: 7% of Australians 

Characteristics: An angular face shape, where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal. Square faces are angular with wider but equal forehead cheekbone and jaw width. 

#7 TEARDROp: 5% of Australians 

Characteristics: Teardrops is a shorter face, with a narrow forehead and cheekbone. This is the only group for which the forehead length is shorter than the chin. 

#8 HEPTAGON: 4% of Australians 

Characteristics: Heptagon faces are typically longer than average. Their most striking features are a wide forehead and prominent cheekbones. 

#9 OBLONG: 2% of Australians 

Characteristics: While rare, the oblong differs from other groups being longer and wider through all measures.
