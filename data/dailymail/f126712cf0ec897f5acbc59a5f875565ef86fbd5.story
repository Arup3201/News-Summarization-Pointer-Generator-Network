A woman is fighting for her life after becoming a human torch when she apparently set herself on fire inside a Scottish police station.

Horrified officers rushed to douse the flames which one eye witness said engulfed the woman's body at Clydebank Police Station in West Dunbartonshire.

Fire crews raced to the scene and an ambulance took the woman to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where she is said to be in a critical condition.

Fire crews raced to the Clydebank Police Station, pictured, after reports a woman apparently set herself on fire with the flames engulfing her body 

Local shop worker Michelle McCusker, 25, was on her way to work this morning when she saw the flames at the front door.

She said: 'As I got closer, I saw it was someone with their whole body covered in flames. I was right across from it.

'The person was covered in flames. Their hands were up in the air.

'Then they bent down to the ground and put their face into the flames. Their whole body was fire. It was like a human torch.'

She added: ''It’s terrible. I heard she torched herself, but I did not know at the time. I didn’t even know whether it was a man or a woman.

After the incident forensic officers in white suits were seen coming in and out of the police station, which was cordoned off with police tape 

An eye witness said the woman was covered in flames before she was taken away in an ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary 

'I thought it was a practice thing, because it was outside the police station.

'There were people walking by and cars were slowing down, but no one stopped to help at the time.'

One local resident, who did not want to be named, also told of how they saw fire engines and ambulances race to the scene.

He said: I saw police officers coming out of the police station itself, maybe three or four officers, maybe more.

'And next thing they stopped. I don’t know if the person collapsed or something like that.

'After that the fire brigade were there first and after that ambulances arrived.

'It’s the kind of thing you expect to see on TV, not here.'

Meanwhile on Twitter, the Scottish Police Federation wrote: 'Horrific incident at Clydebank police station.

A fire hydrant stood just outside the front door, while plastic sheeting could be seen covering objects on the ground

'Difficult to imagine what causes such desperation but horrific for woman involved as well as officers & staff dealing.'

Earlier today, the front of the police station on Montrose Street was cordoned off with police tape while an officer stood guard outside.

A fire hydrant stood just outside the front door, while plastic sheeting covered a few objects on the ground.

Forensics officers in white suits could be seen coming in and out of the building and examining the scene.

A Police Scotland confirmed: 'At around 9.55am police were called to a report of a woman having been injured in the public area of Clydebank Police Office, Montrose Street, Clydebank.

'The woman has been taken by ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for treatment. Enquiries are continuing. No one else was injured.

'Due to the incident, the front counter at Clydebank police office is closed to the public until further notice.'
