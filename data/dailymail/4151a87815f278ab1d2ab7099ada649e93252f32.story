Lucky visitors are being given exclusive access to the enclosure and can shadow bear keepers to learn about how the sanctuary is helping the species of bear to thrive.

Carmen Soto, Inkaterra's resident naturalist, said: 'The Andean spectacled bear has suffered through a gradual destruction of its natural habitat, through agricultural development and an increased human population in South America's Andes Mountains.

'As a consequence, the only species of bear in South America is now in danger of extinction.

'We hope that our continued work, including this new Andean spectacled bear package will help in the raising of international awareness of the bears' plight, in order to save this endangered species.'

The unique package includes a three-night stay at the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Hotel - and guests will learn about the life of a keeper at the Andean spectacled bear project.

A special 'bear kit' which includes a Bear Keeper's certificate and a soft toy spectacled bear is also handed to Paddington fans and animal lovers.
