A nine-year-old girl born without fingers on her left hand has had her life transformed after high school students made her a prosthetic hand using a 3D printer – for just $5.

Students from Boylan Catholic High School in Rockford, Illinois, made the hand for Kylie Wicker after her father, Jeromy Wicker, discovered that another dad had made a 3D printed prosthetic hand for his son.

Mr Wicker emailed the school and asked if they’d be able to embark on a similar project for Kylie after reading that they’d had a 3D printer donated to them - and was delighted when he received a reply a few days later explaining that the hand was already being worked on.

The teacher in charge of the project, Mr Bud May, found instructions for the hand on a website called Robohand and said that the cost came to just a handful of dollars.

Mr May told Fox News that the hand would cost ‘barely $5’, with ‘maybe a dollar’s worth of plastic and a couple of bucks for the fasteners’.

Kylie, who attends Whitman Post Elementary School in Rockton, had become upset at some of the children staring at her, according to her mother, Sharon.

She told Fox News: ‘They weren’t being mean, they were just curious and didn’t understand it.’

Kylie is delighted with her new hand, which will allow her to pick things up in the way other children can.

But she is especially looking forward to being able to ride her bike more easily.

‘I can grab both handle bars and steer a little bit better,’ she said.

The school has made her two hands – a purple one and a pink one – and said they will make her another set when she’s older.

Mrs Wicker added in an interview with ABC: ‘She hasn’t stopped talking about it. This is huge for [the students], too. To give a girl a hand; how many people can say that? This is great for everybody.’

Kylie’s condition was caused by a lack of blood flow to the womb when Mrs Wicker was pregnant.

In a far more ambitious project, U.S scientists are attempting to 3D print a whole human heart.

So far, the University of Louisville in Kentucky has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells, said Stuart Williams, a cell biologist leading the project.

They have also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals and Professor Williams believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years.

The finished product would be called the ‘bioficial heart’ - a blend of the natural and artificial.

The biggest challenge is to get the cells to work together as they do in a normal heart, said Professor Williams, who heads the project at the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute, which is a partnership between the university and Jewish Hospital in Louisville.
