Upcoming Australian Nick Kyrgios battled his way to a tense five-set victory at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Monday night - but needed a new racquet to see out the match. 

Kyrgios smashed his racquet in a moment of anger after losing the second set against Federirco Delbonis - and despite also dropping the fourth set the 19-year-old regained his composure to win 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.

The young Aussie dedicated his win to his grandmother who passed away in 2014.

Kyrgios recently tattooed '74' on his finger, his grandmother's age, to pay tribute to her.

It was a big night for the next generation of Australian tennis, with Thanasi Kokkinaki sealing an astonishing upset over No. 13 Lativan Ernests Gulbis after saving four match points.

 Powering through the first round of the Australian Open, the new kid on the block lit up the night with an incredible five-set victory 5-7, 6-0, 1-6, 7-6, 8-6 on Monday.

It was a thriller performance for the 18-year-old from Adelaide, who is ranked 147th in the world, as he stunned the crowd and served his way out of an early exit of the tennis tournament.

The potential grand slam superstar did a quick head-stand before running a lap of the court as he high-fives his supporters in the crowd after closing the match.

‘I was thrilled with that win. Best win of my career. I’m really happy with how I played,’ Kokkinaki said after his staggering win against 11th seed Guilbis.

‘I started off well, got to 3-0, then dug a hole for myself.

‘I lost my form a lot. I played a really good second set and got on top of it and the match went up and down from there.

‘The crowd was unbelievable the whole night. Great atmosphere.’

Counting down to the dramatic final set, Kokkinaki refused to back down as he pushed the French Open semi-finalist to a decider after coming from behind.

‘I knew what I needed to do to play five-set tennis. Last year I wasn’t quite fit enough but this year, I feel physically very [sic] good so I’m happy with how my body is holding up,’ he said.

Donning a bright retro-fluro yellow and pink sporting gear, the youngster jokingly said 'surely in this outfit I've got to get that win' after Nike sent him the package and said we 'only give this to a few'.

When asked whether he'll be excited to see himself on the front page of newspapers after Monday night's triumph, Kokkinaki responded that it will be 'exciting'.

'I know that it was a good win but there's more to come. I don't want to just win one round. Obviously it was my best win yet and I'll enjoy it for the rest of the night.

'But then tomorrow I've got to get preparing for my next match - two days away.'

The teen's epic win has earned him a match against Australian Sam Groth in the second round.

Kokkinaki added that it was a good win for himself and his close mate Nick Kyrgios, who took out a 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 win over Argentine Federirco Delbonis on Monday night.
