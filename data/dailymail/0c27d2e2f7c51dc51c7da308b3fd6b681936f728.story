The nursery rhyme doesn't say 'If you go down to the woods today you're sure to see a stunning display of British wildlife' but judging by these spectacular photographs, it should.

The finalists from a photography competition celebrating the best of Britain's woods have captured babbling brooks, beds of bluebells and dewy fields.

From 10,000 entries, just 12 pictures taken in woods across the UK were selected as finalists.

Idyllic: With the sun streaming through the trees and a mature bloom of bluebells underfoot, it's easy to see why Ashley Chaplin's photograph of Embley Woods in Hampshire won the competition

Babbling brook: This runner-up photograph taken by Tom Paxton in Kennall Vale, Cornwall captures the movement of a fast stream in mossy surroundings

Moment of serenity: Noel Coates caught this deer in the headlights moment in Garston Wood in Dorset. The Roe deer looks calm as it pops its head above the surroundings bluebells

They were entered into four categories- Forests and People, All Creatures Great and Small, Nature's Playground and Ancient Woods and Modern Wonders.

The winning image taken by Ashley Chaplin shows a humble log cabin nestled deep in a dense wood, surrounded by a sea of dazzling bluebells.

The photograph of Embley Woods in Hampshire was selected for its celebration of a mature woodland.

Ms Chaplin, from Purbeck, Hampshire said she stumbled across the scene by chance.

'I happened upon the wood by accident 
after taking a wrong turn and wandering down a path to see if there was 
anything worth photographing.

The wisest creature in the woods: The marble-effect on this Tawny owl's feathers stands out against the rough bark and moss of the tree. The picture of Rough Hill Wood in Warwickshire was selected as a finalist

Mellow mists: The dew on the grass, autumnal leaves and streaming sun make for a perfect picture- and walk. The photo of London's Richmond Park proves that some of Britain's best woods are in urban areas

Great and small: From a detailed close-up of a snail in Cumbria and a wide shot of a moody forest in Cambridgeshire, the shots celebrate a variety of British woodlands

Natural wonders: Water droplets hang from bracken fronds in the Isle of Mull. Henry Wyn-Jones; steady hand and perfect timing made this shot the perfect woodland close-up

'I was rewarded by discovering one of the most faultlessly beautiful bluebell woods I have ever seen.'

The
 Woodland Trust's competition aims to encourage people to visit the 
11,000 woods it looks after and expose people to the natural wonders 
that are on their doorstep.

Cameraman and presenter Simon King judged the competition. He said the winning picture: 'Gives a true sense of
 the beauty and embrace of mature woodland and its importance in 
harbouring all life, including humanity.'

Funny face: This fallow deer in Calke Abbey, Derbyshire seems to know he is being photographed by Roxanne Kelsall, as he sicks his tongue out for the camera

Dramatic: Some tree-climbing children can be seen in the spiky silhouette of branches against a golden sky in Richmond Park

Birdsong: This open-mouthed baby robin chirped his way to the top of the All Creatures Great and Small category

Perspective: The intricate lines on the shell of a tiny acorn weevil can be seen in this remarkable close-up by Rosie Earwaker
