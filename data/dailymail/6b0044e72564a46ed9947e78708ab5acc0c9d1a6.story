Le flop: Warburtons' Le Toastie was launched in France last August but it is being withdrawn after shoppers over the Channel failed to take to it

British baker Warburtons has pulled out of the French bread market after its 'Le Toastie' loaf failed to compete with the baguette.

Last summer it started selling long life white, brown and seeded loaves - marketed as 'the everyday English bread' - in more than 200 supermarkets across the Channel.

But French consumers would not be moved and stuck to their traditional habit of buying fresh every day.

Warburtons admitted today it had quit the French market because Le Toastie, which had a ten-day shelf life, proved uneconomical.

A Warburtons spokeswoman told The Grocer magazine: 'It was not cost effective to continue to produce and distribute the extended shelf life range solely for France.'

In
France where most people buy freshly baked baguettes every day, sliced 
bread has more preservatives and lasts longer before going stale because
it is typically bought irregularly for use in emergencies.

The decision follows Warburtons’ exit from Eastern Europe at the end of last year.

Its bread products were listed in Tesco stores in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland for a year, but the baker pulled out because of high transport costs and a lack of suitable manufacturing partners in the region.

As part of its export push, Warburtons also developed a frozen range that is selling successfully to expats in Spain and elsewhere.

Faced with a drop in bread sales in the UK, the family owned baker has diversified its range of products.

Couldn't kick the habit: The French love for the baguette and other fresh breads meant the long life Le Toastie failed to make an impact

This year it has grown its ‘free-from’ range under the Newburn Bakehouse sub-brand, relaunched its snacks range under the Escapes name and acquired speciality bread maker Giles Foods.

Warburtons was founded by Thomas Warburton in 1876 and is based in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

For much of its history Warburtons only had bakeries in Lancashire and it remains a family-owned company.

The company embarked on a large expansion program in the late 1990s which continued in the 2000s and it has grown across the UK after being relatively unheard of outside the Bolton and Manchester area.

The firm has a 24 per cent share of the UK bread market and the Warburtons brand is the most popular bread in the United Kingdom, ahead of rivals Kingsmill and Hovis, a position it has held since 2008.

Overall, Warburtons products are the second-best selling food and drink brand in the UK after Coca Cola and ahead of other big British brands such as Cadburys and Walkers.
