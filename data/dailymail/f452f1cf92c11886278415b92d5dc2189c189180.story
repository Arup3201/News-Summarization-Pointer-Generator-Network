Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho has apologised for leaving Anfield ahead of the Merseyside derby on Saturday, after the French international was left out of Brendan Rodgers' squad to face Everton.

Pictures have emerged of Sakho leaving the stadium and heading to his car before the match kicked off, and the 24-year-old posted a statement on social media on Saturday night to apologise to his club and the supporters for what he described as 'a bad choice'.

'I really want to apologise to the club, the supporters and every person who felt offended when I left the stadium this afternoon,' Sakho wrote.

'I'm aware that it was a bad choice from my part to go isolating (sic) to watch the game.'

Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel were the preferred choice in the centre of defence, as Liverpool conceded a late equaliser to draw 1-1 with Everton at Anfield.

Phil Jagielka cancelled out Steven Gerrard's opener with a stunning strike in the dying moments, as both sides left with a point.

Sakho has made five appearances in all competitions for the Reds so far this season, featuring in half of Liverpool's six Premier League matches.

He joined the club from Paris Saint Germain last summer for £18 million, but has been battling with Skrtel for a space in Liverpool's back line after the arrival of Lovren from Southampton in July.
