A power cut could have prevented a 
shark spotter from sounding a warning alarm just before a British 
swimmer was savaged by a great white off the coast of Cape Town in South
 Africa, it has been claimed.

A shark spotter is thought to have 
seen 43-year-old Michael Cohen enter the water and attempted to warn him
 of danger - but the siren didn't work because of a city-wide power cut,
 it has been reported.

According to South Africa's Daily 
News website, an official incident report from the City of Cape Town 
claimed there was an electricity failure with the power company Eskom.

The report said: 'At around 12.25pm (on Wednesday), the
 mountain shark spotter saw a swimmer enter the water near the Clovelly 
Corner area.

Regular swimmer: Michael Cohen, 42, is an accountant who previously lived in Chiswick, west London, before moving to South Africa

'The spotter tried to sound the alarm, but due to an Eskom-related city-wide electricity failure, the alarm did not sound.'

Eskom were unable to comment as the company said it was unaware of the City of Cape Town's incident report.

An Eskom spokeswoman confirmed a power
 cut lasted for two hours, starting from just before 11am to shortly 
after 1pm. It was apparently caused by a trip on the power line 
supplying Cape Town.

However, they were unable to comment 
on the possible impact this had on the shark alarm as they unaware of 
the authority's incident report.

Meanwhile a seal has emerged as an unlikely saviour by apparently helping Michael Cohen as he was attacked by the shark.

Two men who dragged Mr Cohen to shore
 described how the creature swam around them as if to distract the 12ft 
Great White, which appeared to be preparing for a second strike.

Mr Cohen, who lost his right leg and part of his left foot, yesterday remained in a critical condition in hospital.

Creating a diversion: A seal was on the scene as Mr Cohen was pulled from the water

Surgeons paid tribute to the 
remarkable first-aid treatment he received when a shark-spotter tied his
 belt and wetsuit shorts around the 42-year-old’s injured legs as 
improvised tourniquets – stopping him from bleeding to death.

Mr Cohen, an accountant, had ignored warnings of a shark in the area before taking to the water off Fish Hoek beach.

Yesterday, passers-by Hugh Till and 
Douglas Drysdale told how they ran into the blood-clouded surf to help 
pull the stricken swimmer to safety after watching the attack.

The pair modestly played down their own heroics, but highlighted the surprising role of the seal.

‘As Douglas and I were pulling him in
 towards the shore, the seal frolicked nearby, and kept swimming past 
us, it seemed rather agitated.

‘It occurred to us afterwards how 
unusual it was for a seal to stick around in an area where a shark is, 
or where there is blood.

‘It really did feel to us as though 
he was offering support to us, or the swimmer, and was prepared to act 
as a diversion if the shark went after us as well,’ Mr Till said.

The 66-year-old was in the area with 
his friend Mr Drysdale, 61, trying to spot whales when they saw the 
shark looming towards Mr Cohen, who was swimming a few yards from the 
beach.

They stopped their car and ran to 
shout warnings, but it was too late, leaving them to watch helplessly as
 he was pulled under.

Even though the shark remained in the area, 
possibly preparing for a second strike, the two men plunged into the 
water to help in the efforts to drag Mr Cohen to safety.

Professor 
Andrew Nicol, who operated on the swimmer, said he had needed seven 
litres of blood on arriving at hospital.

He had fought to save one of the 
Briton’s legs, even though it was badly bitten, because he had lost the 
other leg.

Mr Cohen’s femoral artery and vein were both torn – usually a
 fatal injury – and Professor Nicol praised the life-saving first-aid 
efforts by a member of the beach’s shark-spotting team. 

‘The tourniquet resulted in the 
almost complete stopping of blood loss from the thigh and I just want to
 commend the people giving first aid on the beach for saving the life of
 this patient,’ he said. 

‘Self-made improvised tourniquets 
don’t tend to work and are frowned on in medical literature, but this 
really was life-saving. If the femoral artery and vein are both severed 
you don’t tend to make it into hospital alive.’

He said the parents of Mr Cohen, who 
is single, had been by his bedside. ‘They are extremely traumatised by 
what’s happened and realise the seriousness of his condition.’   

The Canadian-born accountant, who has
 a British passport and lived in London before moving to South Africa, 
had taken to the water even though the beach was closed after shark 
sightings.

He was said to be a regular swimmer at the beach, who had previously ignored warnings to stay out of the water.

The site of the attack is close to 
one of the highest populations of Great Whites in the world, and has 
seen a number of deaths and injuries to swimmers and surfers.

Last night, experts said the seal had
 been nearby. Craig Lambinon, of the National Sea Rescue Institute, 
said: ‘A shark remained close to the scene throughout medical efforts to
 save the victim, and it has been confirmed that a seal was swimming 
close by during the entire episode.

‘Witnesses confirmed the seal circled the men as they gradually waded ashore with the victim in the presence of a shark.’
