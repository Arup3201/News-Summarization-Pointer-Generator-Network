In the end, it was a birthday treat that took down one of Mexico's most powerful drug lord.

Authorities had been monitoring a farm that they believed Servando Gómez Martínez, or La Tuta as he was known among members of the Knights Templar cartel, could possibly he using as a hideout, and thanks to the delivery of a chocolate cake from his girlfriend María Antonieta Luna Ávalos on his birthday, their suspicions were confirmed.

Mexican security forces moved in on the hideout in Morelia, Michoacán on February 27, and were able to capture Martinez without firing a single shot.

Martinez, known as La Tuta, was the head of the Knights Templar cartel, and previously worked as an elementary school teacher

The Washington Post reports that it was not just the cake that confirmed the location of Martinez, but also the communication habits of one of his most trusted messengers.

While Martinez, 49, never used a cell phone, one messenger did, and would frequently communicate on his device travelling to and from the farm.

Unbeknownst to that messenger however, his phone was being tracked.

'Michoacan now is in a better position,' said Federal Police Commissioner Enrique Galindo Ceballos said. 

'The important parts of the [cartel] structure are neutralized.'

The arrest was also an incredibly big boost for President Enrique Pena Nieto as he tries to deal with the increased gang violence in the country.

Though frequently on the move, and at times living in caves to evade the authorities, Martinez still loved the spotlight, and would often release videos in which he criticized the government for supporting other drug cartels.

He was also known to hand over cash for favorable press. 

The elementary school teacher turned drug lord portrayed himself as a hero in the numerous interviews he granted the media, though in recent years the violence inflicted by members of his cartel had become far more vicious, leading to citizens of the country doing everything they could to help law enforcement in their efforts to take down the organization.

The arrest come less than a year after two of the cartel's most violent members, his sons Luis Alfredo Aguilera Esquivel and Huber Gómez Patiño, were captured by authorities.

With this arrest authorities now believe the Knights Templar cartel may collapse, as almost all the organization's leaders have been captured.

Martinez's group alone, La Familia Michoacana, controlled some 50 methamphetamine labs across Mexico while also making millions from a variety of illegal activities, among them extortion and kidnapping.

The United States charged him under the Kingpin Act in 2010, making it illegal for any Americans or American companies to do business with him, and freezing all his assets in this country.

Martinez is now being held in a maximum security prison. 

He had long said that he would rather be killed than put behind bars. 

Flavio Gomez, Martinez's brother, was arrested during the same raid.
