U.S. ranchers are being forced to sell their cattle as the worst drought in a century sweeps through California, with forecasters predicting only more sunshine and dry weather.

As green grazing pastures turn brown and food costs soar, hundreds of cows and other livestock are being packed into pens and sold to the highest bidder.

It is a stark contrast from the slow business typically seen at this time of year - with ranchers usually having time to fatten up their cattle on spring grass before the busy season strikes in June and July.

In the past few weeks, cowboys have been flocking to the 101 Livestock Market's cattle auction on California's Central Coast to view their potential prizes.

'We're in the drought now, so a lot of cattle are going back to Texas,' said rancher and auction house co-owner Monty Avery, gesturing to a pen filled with cows.

'We usually sell about 100-150 animals per week. Now we're seeing 800-1,000 per week, so the volume's jumped up.'

Last week, governor
 Jerry Brown formally proclaimed California's worst drought since 1895, with soil moisture - a key ingredient for the forage that cattle graze on - dropping even lower throughout the state.  

Ranchers have been left with no choice but to sell their cattle due to the rising cost of hay and other supplemental feed.

'You
 can't keep buying $7,000 to $8,000 (£4,239 to £4,845) a load for hay,' 
said Jim Warren, who also co-owns the auction 
house.

Poor conditions: The drought has caused soil moisture - a key ingredient for the forage that cattle graze on - to drop. Above, cowboy Selerino Esparaza examines cattle

Devastating option: Ranchers have been left with no choice but to sell their cattle - including this calf - because of the rising cost of hay and other supplemental feed

Cause: The dry conditions are believed to have been caused by a 2,000-mile ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical winter weather

'Pretty soon you're in this hole, so you sell your cattle and try to buy 
them back next year.'

The U.S. Drought 
Monitor has confirmed there are 'extreme drought' conditions in central and 
northern California, where much of the state's ranching is located.

Romaldo Martin, a cattle rancher who 
runs M&M Farms in Hollister, has sold more than 160 cows and calves 
at 101 Livestock Market over the past two weeks - and plans to sell at 
least 100 more.

He claims it is 'too expensive' for him to buy hay to feed cattle - with water on his land also in the process of drying up.

'If
 the weather doesn't change, I might need to get rid of all of them, said Mr Martin. 'I've never seen anything like this in my life. It's a 
disaster.'

Dried out: California is now in its third dry year. Above, a goose is shown at Folsom Lake, which is 17 per cent of its capacity in Folsom in Sacramento County, California

Warning: The US Drought Monitor has confirmed there are 'extreme drought' conditions in central and northern California, where much of the state's ranching is located

Concern: Precipitation in most of the state less than 20 per cent of normal - leaving reservoir levels at record lows and prompting many cities to cut water usage

California is now in its third dry year,
 with precipitation in most of the state more than 20 per cent below normal
 - leaving reservoirs and groundwater levels at record lows and 
prompting many cities to cut water usage.

One town on the state's far northern coast has claimed it has fewer than 100 days of drinking water in storage. 

The dry conditions are believed to have been caused by a 2,000-mile 
ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical 
winter weather.

California is the nation's leader in dairy cows, and fourth overall in America, for the total number of cattle, trailing Texas, Nebraska and Kansas, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared a drought disaster on January 16, which allows some farmers to apply for low-interest loans to help them cope.

However, ranchers are not included in the programme, and therefore, do not qualify for any help with rising food costs.

In a bid to help them navigate the 
historic dry weather, the University of California's Division of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources is holding workshops.

'From
 previous droughts, we've learned that feeding the whole herd through 
the drought may spell the end of business,' said Glenn Nader, adviser 
for the program in Sutter and Yuba counties.

Some of California's herd will be 
headed to Texas, which is recovering from its own severe drought and has
 seen its five million-strong herd shrink by a quarter over the past few
 years, according to Jason Cleere, a rancher and beef cattle specialist 
with Texas AgriLife Extension at Texas A&M University.

Left out: American ranchers are not included in the programme, and therefore, do not qualify for any help with the rising cost of feeding their cattle

However, the drought has now eased in most of Texas and the herd is being rebuilt, 
creating a market for California's ranchers looking to sell.

'There is a lot of room for more cows to come into our state, and for ranchers to add some back,' said Mr Cleere.

While
selling cattle can help ranchers cope in the short-term, it can result in more of them being forced out of business in the long-term, ranchers said.

Rebuilding
 a herd is also a far more difficult task than simply buying new cattle - it often takes time to get 
new cows acclimated and can take years for the animals to breed and 
grow.

Meanwhile, the state's herd will be thinned as ranchers attempt to trim costs.
