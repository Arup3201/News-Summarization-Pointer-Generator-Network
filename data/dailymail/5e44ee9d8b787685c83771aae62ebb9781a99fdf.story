A Welsh photographer has been told he cannot bring his new bride to the UK and may be forced to leave the country after the Home Office said he is not a British citizen.

Craig Colville was born in St Asaph in North Wales to British parents but the UK Border Agency has denied his new wife Crystal Levy permission to stay in the country, claiming that he 'does not hold settled status'.

Mr Colville, who even has a twin brother whose citizenship has never been disputed, is now facing leaving Britain over the blunder.

Officials admitted that the bizarre claim was a 'clerical error', but insisted that Mr Colville’s new wife would have to leave the country in any case because she does not make enough money to stay.

Couple: But Craig Colville and Crystal Levy could be separated after the bride was told she must leave Britain

Mrs Colville has been ordered to return to her native Canada, and Mr Colville may have to leave the UK in order to be with her.

The 31-year-old was born in St Asaph in North Wales and was raised in the area, later moving across the Border with England to Chester.

He met his future wife in 2006 when they were working on a cruise ship together, and after a long-distance relationship she moved to Britain on a temporary visa in 2010.

The couple married in Llangollen in July last year, and 29-year-old Mrs Colville applied to the Home Office to become a permanent resident of the UK.

However, UKBA officials turned down the application, claiming that Mr Colville 'does not hold settled status, is not a British citizen and is not a person with refugee leave/humanitarian protection'.

The letter to the couple came despite the fact that the Welshman sent in his passport to support his wife's application.

Identical: But Craig Colville, right, was mistakenly told he was not a British citizen even though his twin brother Scott, left, is, as both were born and raised in North Wales

Mr Colville said: 'My wife and I are extremely upset by how poorly the Home Office has treated our case. It should have been very straightforward as I am a British citizen.'

The couple were told they had to launch an official appeal to get the decision overturned - but the appeal was turned down because a UKBA worker mistakenly told them they had 10 working days to send it in when in fact they only had 10 days.

'When we called to query this we were told the only thing we could do was to lodge an official appeal against the decision not to allow us to appeal,' Mr Colville said.

'It's getting beyond a joke now, I dread to think how much this is going to cost the taxpayer to sort out.'

He added: 'Every bit of paperwork they've sent has been incorrect.'

Mrs Colville has been told that if her 
appeal is unsuccessful she 'must leave the United Kingdom as soon as 
possible' when her present visa runs out.

The letter from UKBA adds: 'If you do not leave the United Kingdom voluntarily, you will be removed to Canada.'

Cutting the cake: A Home Office blunder initially stopped the couple from appealing against the decision

Mr Colville said: 'I do not have the right to live or work in Canada and my worst fear is that we would be separated again, ruining everything we have worked towards.'

His twin brother Scott has never had any problems with his citizenship or right to live in Britain.

Two of Mrs Colville's grandparents were British, meaning that she could have applied for UK citizenship in her own right if she had known about the problems.

A UKBA spokesman said: 'The original paperwork sent to Ms Levy contained a clerical error regarding her husband’s nationality and we have written to her this week to clarify the situation.

'We are clear her husband is a UK national and the error did not affect our decision to refuse Ms Levy’s application for further leave to remain, which was made because she did not meet the necessary financial requirements.'

The couple contacted their local MP, Stephen Mosley, and he agreed to write to UKBA in support of the citizenship application.

Together: The pair met when they were both working on a cruise ship in 2006

The only extended period of time Mr Colville has spent outside the country came when he worked on a cruise ship where Mrs Colville was also employed.

'We were in next-door cabins,' he said. The first time I saw her I thought: 'She looks like fun. She also looks trouble!'

'We got chatting at crew parties when we were stationed in Alaska for three months - it was an interesting place for a romance to blossom.'

He said the couple's wedding last summer had been 'beautiful', adding: 'We'd like to start a family and build a decent way of life, but that's pretty much impossible under the current circumstances.'

Mrs Colville said she shared her husband's frustration at the UKBA's blunders: 'I know they have a backlog of cases, but these mistakes were avoidable and we did nothing wrong.

'But nobody is reading the paperwork any more. And when I asked for an appointment to speak to someone face to face I was told that wasn't possible.

'We are just hoping everything will work out right.'

Partners of British citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the UK Border Agency.

They must prove that they and their other half are both over 18, that their relationship is 'genuine and subsisting', that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under UK law, and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the UK.

UKBA also requires proof that would-be British citizens have met their partner in person, that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under UK law, and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down.

Financial requirements: Barman Justin Tutt has been told he is not earning enough to keep his South African children with him in the UK following the sudden death of their mother

Finally the applicant must show that they meet UKBA's list of 'suitability requirements', along with its English language requirement, and - crucially for Crystal Colville - its financial requirement.

This states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a British citizen must have an income of at least £18,600.

If the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country, the minimum income goes up to £22,400.

Each additional child requires an additional income of £2,400.

The UKBA states on its website that applicants can meet the financial requirement from the employment or self-employment of their sponsor, as well as through their own employment.

Cash savings are also taken into account when applications are being considered, along with any benefits or pension payments the applicant or their sponsor receive in the UK.

Last month barman Justin Tutt, 29, told how he was facing having his two children taken into care 8,500 miles away after being told he was not earning enough to keep them in the UK.

Mr Tutt brought his son Seth, eight and five-year-old daughter Leigh to live in England with him following the sudden death of their mother in their native South Africa.

But despite Mr Tutt holding a British passport and having another son born in the UK, under new immigration rules cracking down on asylum seekers claiming benefits, Seth and Leigh cannot stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least £22,500 a year.

Because Mr Tutt brings home only £120 a week and his fiancee is on maternity leave, the youngsters will be deported in March and are likely to be taken into care.

New rules governing the applications of the partners of British citizens came in on July 8 2012.

Would-be British citizens who applied before that date were required to prove that they and their sponsor had adequate means to support themselves without relying on state handouts, but no specific minimum income level was set.
