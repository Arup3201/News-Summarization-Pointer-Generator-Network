Still smiling? Nick Buckles, chief executive of GS4, does not know if all Olympic security staff will be able to speak English

Having been forced to apologise for failing to recruit enough Olympics security staff G4S's boss was left red-faced again today after he admitted he had no idea if those who are working could speak English.

Asked whether all the security guards the company had recruited could speak fluent English, chief executive Nick Buckles said it was a 'difficult question to answer'.

He added: 'I am pretty 
sure that they can, but I can’t say categorically as I sit here today.'

Later asked the same question by Sky Mr 
Buckles said: 'As part of the SIA (Security Industry Authority) training
 and as part of the SIA certification you have to be able to speak 
English. That’s the standard for the UK security industry.'

The G4S supremo's latest revelation follows his apology for failing to provide enough security for the games -  causing the army to be drafted in to plug the hole.

Mr Buckles, who earns £1.2million a year, said accepted full responsibility for the fiasco  over providing guards  for the Olympics and has today confirmed the penalty 
payment would be in the range of £10million to £20million as a result of the 
firm’s failure to meet its commitments.

In a statement late last night, the 
company disclosed that it stood to lose up to £50 million on its £284 
million contract with the Games organisers, Locog, as a result of the 
fiasco.

It said it ‘deeply regrets’ the mistakes 
which led to 3,500 servicemen being summoned at the 11th hour to plug 
gaps in its Olympics security operation. The admission apparently 
followed heated discussions with furious Home Office officials.

Today G4S has said it will meet the full cost of deploying thousands of extra troops to the London Olympics after it failed to supply sufficient numbers of security guards.

However Mr Buckles said that the bulk of the loss would come from paying the Ministry of Defence to supply 3,500 additional troops to make up the shortfall.

'We accept that we underestimated the task of supplying staff for the Olympics. We deeply regret that,' Mr Buckles told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

Despite having signed the initial contract in 2010, Mr Buckles said that he had only realised 'eight or nine days ago' that there would be a shortfall in the numbers.

'We are recruiting a large number of people, they are all working through a process of interview, two or three different degrees of training, licensing, accreditation,' he said.

'Our review process was around the number of people applying for interviews, we had 100,000 of those, the number of people interviewed which was 50,000.

'So basically you work through that process of numbers and as they were getting ready for deployment over a period of time, it’s only when you get closer and closer to the Games that your realise that the number isn’t as high as you expect.'

The Daily Mail has also revealed 
police would also have to deploy several hundred extra officers to do 
work which should have been done by G4S guards.

Senior police officers welcomed G4S’s apology, but privately expressed fears that it was ‘too little and too late’.

G4S said it accepted responsibility for the additional cost of the increased military deployment.

It is the first open acknowledgement by chief executive Nick Buckles that the world’s largest security provider has dismally failed in its obligations to provide 10,000 staff for Olympic venues since news of the recruitment scandal emerged on Wednesday.

‘The company is also incurring other significant costs as it endeavours to meet the contract challenges,’ the firm admitted.

‘Whilst it is not possible to gauge the precise financial impact, it is estimated that the company will incur a loss on the contract in the range of £35 million to £50 million, all of which will fall in the current financial year.’

Call up: Extra police have been drafted in to fill the gaps in Olympics security caused by blundering private firm G4S

It is understood the deduction in pay for the Olympics work will take G4S out of profit on the Games contract.

In its statement, G4S said it had run into difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training and vetting procedures in what it described as ‘an extremely complex workforce supply contract’ on an ‘unprecedented scale’.

‘As a result, we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers,’ it said.

‘We have worked very closely with Locog throughout the build up. At the point we felt that we could no longer assure the scale of the security workforce we had committed to, we advised them of the situation.’

Mr Buckles, who has been summoned to give evidence before the Home Affairs Select Committee next Tuesday, said: ‘We are deeply disappointed that we have not been able to fully deliver against our contract with Locog and that it has been necessary to call upon the additional military personnel.  In partnership with the military and Locog, we are working flat out around the clock to resolve the situation.  We are determined that together we will deliver a successful and secure Games.’

John Connolly, G4S Chairman, added: ‘It is a significant disappointment to everyone at the Company that we have fallen short of our obligations.’

Debacle: The officers will join an additional 3,500 troops who have been drafted in to help protect the Olympic park

As the apology was released, the Mail learnt that several hundred extra police are to be drafted into the Olympics security operation to fill the gaps caused by the blundering private firm.

It comes only two days after 3,500 troops had to be called up to help protect the Olympic Park.The latest move is a major embarrassment to Home Secretary Theresa May, who is coming under increasing pressure over her handling of the affair. A senior security source said: ‘Behind the scenes, some senior officers are seething. They have lost confidence in G4S and are angry that they have been left to pick up the pieces.’

G4S admitted earlier this week it might not be able to provide enough guards, resulting in the Army being called in.

Now, amid fears G4S will still not be able to provide anywhere near the revised number of security guards it has promised for the Games, police chiefs have been forced to put hundreds of extra officers on Olympics duties.

A total of 17,000 servicemen and women 
will now be involved in the Olympics, including 11,800 soldiers, 2,600 
sailors and marines, and 2,600 airmen

They are expected to carry out basic functions such as guarding entrances, and possibly searching spectators and bags. Around 12,000 officers were already due to be on duty across the Olympic venues on peak days, but this figure is now likely to top 13,000.The decision to call in extra police was seen as a sign of the complete lack of confidence senior officers have in G4S.

Retired Met chief superintendent Kevin Hurley said: ‘I suspect a number of senior officers who, with their teams, have worked very hard preparing for the Olympics will feel very disappointed at being let down at such a late stage by a private security firm.’

A total of 17,000 servicemen and women will now be involved in the Olympics, including 11,800 soldiers, 2,600 sailors and marines, and 2,600 airmen. Some 11,000 of these will be involved in the security of more than 30 sporting venues and some 70 non-competition venues, including car parks and hotels, while others will carry out specialist support roles. Overall, the security force for the Games will include a mix of military, private security guards and more than 2,000 unpaid London 2012 volunteers.

Last night it was claimed that management at a G4S vetting centre were aware six months ago that it would not meet recruitment targets it was set to provide security at the Olympics. A former employee told Channel 4 News the company knew in January that there would be serious problems reaching the new level of 10,000 Olympic security staff – a figure revised up from 2,000 by London 2012 organisers Locog in December.

G4S has not yet responded to the whistleblower’s allegations. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said several hundred officers would be deployed at venues in Dorset and the West Midlands to plug the gap left by G4S. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, National Olympic Security Co-ordinator, said:  ‘This is not impacting on our existing plans for the safety and security operation, which we are confident we can still meet.’
