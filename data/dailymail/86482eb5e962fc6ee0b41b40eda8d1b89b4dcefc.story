A mother has said she is pulling her teenage son out of the Al-Madinah Muslim free school on the day the Government said it must take 'swift action' to address concerns over the way it is run or face the prospect of closure.

Jacqueline Crossley, 53, has said her son, who she does not want to be identified, was forced to cover his head and banned from looking at female students and is the only non-religious pupil at the school in Derby.

She has now decided to withdraw the 14-year-old from the school after claiming he was forced to join lessons with five-year-olds when he opted out of lessons studying the Qu'ran.

And according to a letter sent to the school by Lord Nash, Al-Madinah has failed to keep pupils safe, provide a good education and has discriminated against female staff.

The Schools Minister said that the school had 'manifestly breached' its conditions, and can expect to be closed down if it does not make immediate changes.

Ms Crossley said she was told she couldn't sit near her son at an awards night because women and men would be separated by a partition.

She said: 'I sent my son to the school because he had been badly bullied at his last school and I felt that a faith school would be a safe place to send him.

'But it felt as though the bullying was coming from the school, rather than other teenagers. He was discriminated against because he had no religion.

The school was temporarily closed last week due to a 'health and safety issue' following an Ofsted inspection

'At an awards night, I wanted to sit with my son and enjoy the evening.

'But
he said: "No, mum, you can't the woman aren't allowed to sit with the 
men" - and there was a big partition in the hall so I couldn't see him. I
was stunned.'

Ms Crossley was left furious after she 
was told her son would get extra tuition in core subjects if he opted 
out of daily Qu'ran and Islamic study sessions but was instead sent to 
assist a teacher with a reception class.

She also claimed her son had been told off for looking at female students.

She said: 'The girls sat at the back of the classrooms, and the boys at the front. My boy was told under no circumstances should he look behind at the girls.'

Lord Nash's letter orders the school to provide evidence within the next week that it has stopped any practices that lead to women and girls being treated 'less favourably' than men and boys, and to notify all of its staff that they are not required to cover their hair if it is against their religion or beliefs.

It says: 'The Trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by failing to ensure the safety of children at the school; delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education; discriminating in its policies and procedures towards female staff; and failing to discharge its duties and responsibilities in respect of the governing body.

'I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement.'

The letter, addressed to Shazia Parveen, chairwoman of governors at Al-Madinah Free School also sets out other action that the school must take in the next few weeks, including satisfying the Government that its curriculum is 'broad and balanced' and that it is welcoming to children of all faiths and none.

Lord Nash warns: 'Unless swift action is taken to address these concerns in a comprehensive way I will be compelled to terminate the school's funding agreement.'

This effectively means that the school will face closure if it fails to deal with the Government's concerns.

Al-Madinah, which is one of the Government's flagship free schools, opened in September last year.

On its website, it describes 'a strong Muslim ethos' with shorter holidays and longer school days 'to maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and success'.

It adds: 'At the centre of our school is a community of pupils, able to enjoy learning in a caring Islamic environment which promotes a culture of high expectations and outstanding performance.'

Recently, there have been reports in the media that female teachers at the school were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim.

Other reports claimed that female pupils were made to sit at the back of the classroom and males at the front.

Interim principal Stuart Wilson told the BBC last week that he had not received any complaints from colleagues over the school's dress code and denied that pupils had been split up.

While Ofsted's findings have not been finalised and none has been published, reports suggest the watchdog will judge it 'inadequate', the lowest rating.

Lord Nash's letter comes on the same day that Ofsted confirmed that its report into Al-Madinah Free School, which was forced to close last week just hours after inspectors arrived, is due to be published in the next few days.

The school's inspectorate also confirmed that the principal of the school took the decision to shut due to inspectors' concerns that records showing whether staff were cleared to supervise children were missing or incomplete.

The school re-opened to pupils yesterday.

In a statement, Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said the school re-opened after inspectors made a return visit to ensure that the right checks - such as criminal records checks - were in place.

'Ofsted began an inspection of Al-Madinah School on Tuesday October 1,' Sir Michael said.

'Unless swift action is taken to address
these concerns in a comprehensive way I will be compelled to terminate 
the school's funding agreement'Â

'On the same day, the principal took the decision to close the school as a result of inspection concerns over safeguarding checks. Inspectors discovered that staff records showing whether they were cleared to supervise children were either missing or incomplete.

'The school remained closed until yesterday when inspectors made a return visit to satisfy themselves that the necessary safeguarding arrangements were in place and that there were sufficient numbers of adults with the necessary clearance for the school to function safely.

'In particular, inspectors needed to see evidence that CRB/DBS checks had been properly completed for employees and were held on an accurate, single central register.

'Inspectors are now engaged in finalising the inspection report for Al-Madinah School, which we expect to be able to publish in the next few days.'

Mr Wilson said at the time the school was closed that the decision had been taken on health and safety grounds, later insisting the action was to address a 'short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur'.
