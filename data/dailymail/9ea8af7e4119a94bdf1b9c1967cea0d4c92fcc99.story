It is not perhaps what one would expect to find in a museum, but in Iceland the humble burger and chips is an endangered item.

The McDonald's meal has spent the last year on display in Iceland's national museum, after the final fast food outlet shut down in the country.

Now, the salty snack has gone one step further in becoming a historic item, going on display in a hostel - complete with a webcam so fans can document the food as it decays.

The last McDonald's burger and fries sold in Iceland is now on display at the Bus Hostel in Reykjavik

Bus Hostel in Reykjavik proudly displays the last purchased cheeseburger from the chain, which left Iceland in 2009, on display in their reception area. And yes, it's still in its original wrapper.  

Iceland's economic crash in late 2008 ultimately led the global fast food chain to close their doors in the country.

The last day that locals could pick up a McDonald's burger was October 31, 2009.

One particularly forward-thinking man, Hjortur Smarason, went to McDonald's the day before to pick up one of the final offerings - not to eat, but to keep on his garage shelf. 

The hostel has even set up a livestream - of the burger under glass - to allow fans to watch it rot and decay

The fast foot chain exited Iceland in October 2009, following the country's economic collapse

After a year at the national museum, the burger recently - and inexplicably - moved to the hostel, where it is kept on display under glass.

The property has also set up a livestream for those who can't make it to Reykjavik to watch it rot and decay from anywhere in the world.

It could be a slow process, however, as the livestream site warns that 'you will have to be patient to see any changes' in its appearance.
