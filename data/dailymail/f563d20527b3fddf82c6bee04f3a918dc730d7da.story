Five men who broke an American student's eye socket with a bottle he was drinking from 'because he was obviously not local' were told today that they will be put behind bars.

Francesco Hounye, 23, had been in Britain just three days when he was set upon by the mob who kicked him in the head as he lay seriously wounded on the ground, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. 

Mr Hounye was attacked in an area where a 'Muslim patrol' attempting to enforce Sharia law in east London had previously been caught on camera, however police have stressed that this was not the motive in this case.

Violent attack: Francesco Hounye has been scarred by life for the savage attack, with his assailants today told that they will face jail

The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'There is no evidence to suggest that this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way. Speculation to the contrary is wrong and potentially damaging to community relations.' 

They said Mr Hounye was assaulted simply because he was 'obviously not local.'

He left too terrified to go out in London after the incident and has since returned to Florida.

Samad Uddin, 24, Shaleem Uddin, 20, Shadhat Hussain, 19, Kamrul Hussain, 22, and Massom Rahman, 22, targeted Mr Hounye when they saw him swigging from a bottle of Jagermeister.

The student had been out for the night and was walking with a friend to his home in Shadwell, east London.

He was confronted by the group, who wrestled the bottle from him.

The thugs chased him, continued to beat him, and smashed the bottle over his head.

CCTV footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road.

He was left needing 23 stitches and was scarred for life after the brutal assault.

Violence: The attack on Mr Hounye only ended when a passer-by intervened

Six months after the attack a demonstration was staged in nearby Brick Lane where around 60 protestors targeted Muslim-owned businesses for selling 'evil' alcohol.

Samad Uddin was on trial for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent after the four others admitted their roles in the attack.

Uddin changed his plea and admitted the charge.

Judge Tudor Owen said custodial sentences were 'inevitable' for all the gang and told Samad Uddin: 'You pleaded guilty and you'll receive some credit for that.

'It will be a custodial sentence and by that I do not mean a suspended sentence.'

Shaleem Uddin and Kamrul Hussain both hold previous convictions for assaults in 2010, but they escaped with suspended sentences.

Shadhat Hussain has been before the courts for possession of cannabis and cocaine while Rahman was of previous good character.

The gang were identified after CCTV surveillance captured the apparently spontaneous group attack.

'All of them were willingly involved in that attack, all of them played a part,' said prosecutor Paul Casey.

'Two in particular played the most serious role, Shaleem Uddin and Samad Uddin.

'Shaleem Uddin used the bottle to strike Mr Hounye over the head, causing him severe cuts to the side of his head.

'Immediately prior to that, Samad Uddin and a number of others were involved trying to wrestle the bottle from Mr Hounye.'

'During the course of the attack Samad Uddin aimed a number of kicks to Mr Hounye whilst he was prone on the ground, including one which CCTV shows his right foot connecting with some force with Mr Hounye's head.'

Mr Hounye was walking down the New Road, Shadwell, with the friend he was visiting on June 17 last year.

'Both of them had been drinking alcohol and Mr Hounye had a bottle of liquor with him - the brand was Jagermeister,' explained Mr Casey.

They were pursued down the road and to the junction with Commercial Road where the gang 'confronted and surrounded' Mr Hounye.

In the CCTV footage Samad Uddin can be seen taking hold of Mr Hounye's shoulder.

The victim was then grabbed from behind by a second male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches.

'The first punches are thrown at Mr Hounye, the bottle is wrestled from him, Shelim Hussain smashes him over the head with the bottle,' said Mr Casey.

Samad Uddin is seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to escape.

But he was pounced on by the mob, the student was punched against the wall.

The gang ran off when a passer-by intervened.

Samad Uddin was arrested in April this year after he was recognised by a police officer who had seen the CCTV footage.

He initially claimed the allegations were as a result of mistaken identity.

Samad Uddin, of Shadwell, and Shaleem Uddin, of Romford Street, Whitechapel, have admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Kamrul Hussain, of Whitechapel and Shadhat Hussain, of Canning Town, and Masoom Rahman, of Whitechapel, east London, have admitted the same charge.

The gang are due to be sentenced on July 25.
