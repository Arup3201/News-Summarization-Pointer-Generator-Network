Premier Inn has become the latest company to remove thousands of beef burgers from its restaurants over fears they may be contaminated with horse meat as its supplier suspends operations.

The firm at the centre of the horse meat scandal - Irish company ABP - has failed to give the UK hotel chain assurances that their stock has not been contaminated. 

It comes as burger supplier announced a temporary closure at its Silvercrest processing plant in Co Monaghan after new tests confirmed the contamination was rife.

A Premier Inn spokesman said: 'We take
 the quality of our food very seriously. We asked our supplier, 
Silvercrest, to give us assurances that the beefburger product supplied 
to us was not affected by this issue.

'After
 they initially gave us this assurance they have subsequently told us 
they cannot now give us this guarantee. As a precautionary measure, we 
therefore immediately took the decision to remove their products from 
our menus.

'As we use 
two beefburger suppliers we have been able to quickly replace all our 
Silvercrest stock through our alternative provider.'

ABP
 said fresh tests from burgers produced in the last two weeks confirmed a
 European processing company – believed to be in Spain or the 
Netherlands – as the source of contamination.

The
 unnamed company supplied a meat bulking protein powder that was used in
 burgers made for supermarkets in Britain and Ireland.

ABP also used the ingredient in the Yorkshire factory run by its Dalepak subsidiary.

Last night the company said: ‘To date, ABP Food Group investigations have centred around two third party EU suppliers.

'Following
 receipt of this evening’s Irish Department of Agriculture results, we 
believe that we have established the source of the contaminated material
 to one of these suppliers.

'However,
 because equine DNA has been found in finished products tested this 
week, we have decided that the responsible course of action is to 
suspend all production at the Silvercrest plant in County Monaghan with 
immediate effect.

'This week’s production has not been released from the 
plant.’

The company also
 supplies Burger King but last night insisted there was no chance of the
 fast food chain's products being contaminated as they are made and stored separately at the plant.

It
 said: 'We would like to reiterate that all Burger King products 
produced by us are stored separately and manufactured on an independent 
line.

Cover-up? The Food Standards Agency is in charge of handling Britain's response to the scandal. However, the official watchdog has made efforts to limit the scope of its investigation

There is no evidence of any contamination of raw material used for the manufacture of any Burger King products.'

Irish
 agriculture minister Simon Coveney said an investigation will continue 
to establish conclusively the source of the equine DNA.

In
 Britain, watchdogs are under pressure to test all supermarket frozen 
beefburgers for the presence of horse meat amid fears of an official 
cover-up.

The demand 
came after it emerged that a raft of big brand burgers and grills sold 
under the Ross, Dalepak, Flamehouse and Thomas Adams names are being 
withdrawn.

More than ten
 million burgers have been removed from sale, including more than 
100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak, which supplied 
Iceland.

Labour says 
comprehensive food tests are needed to let families know how far horse 
meat contamination has spread into the food supply. The Government has 
put the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in charge of handling Britain’s 
response to the scandal, which was uncovered in Ireland.

However, the official watchdog has made efforts to limit the scope of its investigation.

The manufacturers involved also made cheap frozen burgers for Asda (pictured), Sainsbury's, and the Co-op among others

Iceland has revealed that its frozen burgers contaminated with horse DNA will be converted into fuel. 

The supermarket has so far withdrawn more than 2,000 units following the FSAI’s damning report.

Iceland said useful organic materials from the waste animal tissue would be released through a ‘rendering’ process and converted into fuel. 

Sainsbury’s has also removed one line from its shelves, although it was not implicated in the report. 

But a spokeswoman ensured that the meat would not go to waste, saying: ‘The products withdrawn from stores will be sent to anaerobic digestion plants.

‘This is the most efficient method of generating energy from waste, and part of our broader ‘zero food waste to landfill’ strategy. We are the UK’s largest retail user of anaerobic digestion.’

As
 a result, families may never know the full extent of the contamination 
of burgers and other beef ready meals using suspect ingredients.

Tesco
 and Iceland have been selling burgers in the UK that came from batches 
found to be contaminated with horse meat in tests by the Food Safety 
Authority of Ireland.

Supermarket
 giant Tesco has placed full-page adverts in a number of national 
newspapers apologising to customers for selling beefburgers containing 
horsemeat.

Aldi, Lidl 
and Iceland have also withdrawn frozen beefburgers from their shelves 
after they were found to be contaminated with horsemeat.

Although
 manufacturers Silvercrest and Dalepak also made cheap frozen burgers 
for other retailers such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op, Britain’s 
FSA said yesterday morning that it had no intention of testing the 
burgers of these other stores, which were on shelves until they were 
withdrawn earlier this week.

Even
 so, Sainsbury's, Asda and the Co-op have withdrawn some frozen products
 but stressed that the move was 'purely precautionary' and they had not 
been found to be selling contaminated food.

FSA officials said there was no food safety risk and, therefore, no reason to test.

Later,
 however, it said: ‘If the FSA investigations being undertaken at the 
moment reveal that we need to look at additional food products then we 
will not hesitate to take action which may include further testing.’

Meanwhile, farming leaders called today for immediate action by UK supermarkets to improve their sourcing and labelling of food in the wake of the horse meat burger scandal.

National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall said the integrity of UK-produced meat was being compromised by the use of cheaper imports which did not meet the same stringent monitoring systems.

He said retailers must take immediate action to address the integrity of their suppliers and ensure that UK products are easily distinguishable and clearly labelled, so customers can make a conscious decision on the food they buy.

Mr Kendall added: 'The events of the past few days have severely undermined confidence in the UK food industry and farmers are rightly angry that the integrity of stringent UK-farmed products is being compromised by using cheaper imported alternatives which, evidence suggests, do not meet the robust traceability systems we have in the UK.'

He said farmers were also concerned that the high standards and traceability they have to meet are not being upheld throughout the supply chain.

'What is particularly concerning is that this revelation comes at a time when farmers are under enormous pressures and consumer confidence is low.

'Retailers will know they must take immediate action to address both the integrity of all their suppliers, and at the same time ensure that UK products are easily distinguishable and clearly labelled.

'We need to move this debate on to find lasting solutions by putting an end to co-mingled products which mix UK meat with imported meat, as well as clearer labelling of all ingredients in products to ensure consumers can make a conscious buying decision."

He also urged retailers to work more closely with the Red Tractor assurance scheme, which ensures products are British and have met certain standards, increase the scheme's logo on packs and focus on the long-term sustainability of the UK supply chain.
