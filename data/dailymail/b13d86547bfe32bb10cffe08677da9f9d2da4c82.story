Televangelist Pat Robertson has compared electronic payments and new technologies which would make cash redundant to the 'Mark of the Beast'.

The television preacher warned viewers of CBN how new technologies in electronic payments could be used as a form of 'control'.

Citing a passage from the Bible's book of Revelation, the television preacher warned of the 'dark side' of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies.

'The Bible says that they cannot buy or sell without the Mark of the Beast,' he says.

'And people said, "Oh, well, that's just fanciful Hebrew rhetoric that doesn’t apply to anybody real." Who would have thought that we could live in an age that that could literally come to pass?'

He later warns the audience of new technologies whereby people will no longer be required to use cash and instead carry a card which can be automatically read upon entering a store.

He says: 'I hate to tell you, it's coming. Because it is a control thing. And Satan wants to control the lives of all the world.

'He wants to be God, he wants to be worshipped as God. And he wants to have control over everybody, and that's how it will be done.'

He finishes the address with: 'Can't buy, can't sell without the Mark of the Beast.'

A report broadcast as part of the segment also featured Katherine Albrecht, the author of two books about RFID, who said: 'There will be a time when humanity will be forced to take a mark and that mark will be on the right hand or the forehead. It is the number 666.'

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects.

RFID tags are used to track animals and are inserted beneath their skin.

The anti-theft hard plastic tags attached to merchandise in stores use the technology.

RFID tags are used to check baggage in airports and identify trees.

They are embedded in credit cards and Oyster transport cards so users can make payments by touching an electronic reader.

She goes on to say: 'Some people say 
RFID will be the Mark of the Beast because it can be a mark on your hand
 that you can transmit.

'If
 it isn't, and it may well not be, there may well be something that 
comes next beyond that to fulfil that biblical prophecy, but every one 
of those steps was getting us closer to that end destination.'

Robertson's website allows viewers to buy his book through electronic transaction.

Meanwhile viewers are also able to donate to CBN through credit cards, electronic funds transfers and cash, The Raw Story reported.

In July last year Robertson told a viewer who wrote into his show about having a haunted house to burn the house down, move or perform an exorcism.

'You need to get people to come and do an exorcism over that property and command those demons to leave, that’s what you do. You take authority in the name of Jesus' he said on an episode of The 700 Club.

However, several online commenters speculated that the Southern Baptist icon was being trolled by someone who submitted the question hoping he would react exactly as he did.
