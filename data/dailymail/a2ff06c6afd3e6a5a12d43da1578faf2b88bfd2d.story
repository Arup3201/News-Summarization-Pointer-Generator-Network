A woman has been jailed for allegedly stealing thousands of dollars from her own son - while he was serving with the U.S. Army overseas.

Police in northeast Ohio said they arrested 42-year-old Jennifer Fletcher on Sunday during a traffic stop.

A warrant had been out for her arrest after she allegedly stole state and federal income tax refunds from her son Scott Davis while he was in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Sgt Paul Stanley of the Lawrence Township Police Department told MailOnline that the two had a good relationship and lived together prior to his deployment in 2010, but it has since apparently soured.

He said that Fletcher and her son no longer have contact and he has since been re-deployed.

The Canton Repository reported that police stopped Fletcher in Brewster after determining the vehicle she was driving had been reported stolen.

Court records obtained by the paper showed that Fletcher cashed checks in her sonâ€™s name after forging his signature.

She also allegedly deposited nearly $1,400 of Davis' state and federal income tax refunds into her account to pay her bills.

The Repository reported Fletcher is suspected of withdrawing $7,500 from her son's account in 2010 and 2011 and forging his signature to cash checks in his name.

Davis' wife noticed something was wrong and reported the theft to police back in May.

A warrant was issued for Fletcher's arrest in July.

Lawrence Township Police Chief Mark Brink told the paper that Fletcher admitted to stealing the money while she was detained by his officers.

Chief Brink said it was 'a good job by our guys getting a confession out of her.'

Fletcher was subsequently arrested on charges of theft, identify fraud and forgery.

Fletcher was taken to jail, and records listed no attorney for her.

Bond has been set at $150.000.

Police also arrested Keith Hoover, 44, who had been sharing a home with Fletcher at the time the money was stolen.
