A California 'beach bum' has no job, surfs and drinks when he wakes up every afternoon and has no intentions of finding employment anytime in the near future - yet, he eats lobster or gourmet sushi everyday.

Jason Greenslate, 29, owes his successful culinary mooching to one thing: food stamps.

Greenslate recently was profiled on Fox News for a special segment about the abuses of the nation's food stamp program. And despite mooching off American taxpayers for a living, Greenslate is remarkably unapologetic, nor does he feel any shame for abusing a system designed to help people who truly are in need.

'This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything 
changing,' Greenslate said in the interview. 'It’s free 
food; it’s awesome.'

During a later interview with the Huffington Post, Greenslate added that 'I don't feel like a bum. I pull hot chicks, drive nice cars, 
dress nice and wear the most baddest jewelry in the world.'

During the segment, Greenslate is seen driving expensive cars, drinking beer and grilling lobsters with his friends. Before the cookout, cameras followed Greenslate into a grocery store and watched him purchase the food with his government-issued Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) card.

With the card - which only needs to be renewed once a year - Greenslate is given $200 a month for food. There is no requirement that he even look for employment.

Previously, there were stipulations that food stamp recipients with no family could only receive food stamps for three months every three years unless they had part time employment or were involved in a jobs program. The goal was to help people who couldn't make ends meet, not supplement income so people could surf and drink beer.

Many of those types of restrictions were eliminated when President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus bill, which allows people like Greenslate to abuse the system.

On Thursday, Congress passed a bill that would reduce food stamp spending by five percent. Prior to the vote, Congressional leaders were shown the video featuring Greenslate.

'You can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you,' Congressman Tim Huelskamp said following the vote.

Republicans in Congress have used Greenslate as the poster-child for the need for entitlement reform. But Democrats have cast aside that notion, claiming that he doesn't represent the majority of the people who receive assistance.

'I don't give a damn about surfer dude,' Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern said. 'As far
 as I'm concerned, he can walk off the nearest pier. To suggest that 
he's the face of SNAP is offensive.'

As for the Congressional vote, Greenslate noted, 'I don't think that one person should be the decision for 47 million people.'
