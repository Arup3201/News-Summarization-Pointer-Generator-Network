Luis Suarez will pull on the same shirt once occupied by some iconic names when he returns from his ban to take the field for Barcelona.

Alexis Sanchez departing to Arsenal left the No 9 vacant only for a day. Suarez wore the No 7 at Liverpool but adopts the premier striker’s shirt at the Nou Camp; whether Lionel Messi and Neymar will allow him that position on the pitch is another matter.

Suarez follows in illustrious steps: 

Ronaldo (Barcelona 1996-97)

The Phenomenon at his best. In one season aged 20 Ronaldo made himself a hero in Catalonia, scoring 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions including the winner in the Cup Winners’ Cup final under Bobby Robson.

Samba star: Ronaldo lit up La Liga well before his days as a Real Madrid striker

His pace, touch and finishing was like no other and one goal against Compostela is worthy of its own highlights reel. During the season he became the youngest World Footballer of the Year.

Patrick Kluivert (1998-2004)

Brought in by Louis Van Gaal as part of his Dutch revolution, Kuivert was one of Europe’s most sought after strikers having scored the winning goal in the Champions League final with Ajax.

He turned down the advances of Manchester United and struck up a dynamic partnership with Rivaldo, winning La Liga in his first season. In all he scored 120 goals in 255 appearances.

Samuel Eto’o (2004-2009)

The most decorated No 9 of the lot. Eto’o paid immediate dividends, scoring 29 goals in all competitions as Barca won La Liga in his debut season.

The next year he won the Spanish golden boot and was man-of-the-match in the Champions League final victory over Arsenal. He also scored in the 2009 win over Manchester United – his 129th goal in 201 games for the club – and completed the Treble.  

Zlatan Ibrahimovic (2009-10)

Perhaps the only stellar No 9 to be deemed a flop, Ibrahimovic nevertheless scored 21 goals in 45 appearances and won La Liga, UEFA Super Cup, and the Club World Cup.

Couldn't settle: Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved on after just one season in La Liga

But he was never settled and loathed Lionel Messi’s influence, later saying very uncomplimentary things about manager Pep Guardiola. He spent a season on loan at AC Milan before signing permanently.

P.S.

Suarez becomes the fifth winner of the European Golden Shoe to be signed by Barcelona.

The Uruguayan scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season to win the award jointly with Cristiano Ronaldo. All have done pretty well.

Hans Krankl, Rapid Vienna, 41 goals 1977-78

In his first Liga season he scored 29 goals to top the charts in Spain and finish third top scorer in Europe.

He also shone in the victorious Cup Winners’ Cup final.

Hristo Stoichkov, CSKA Sofia, 38 goals 1989-90

A club legend and one of the most iconic members of Johan Cruyff’s Dream Team, wining the European Cup in 1992 and the Ballon d’Or in 1994 as well as five La Liga titles.

Henrik Larsson, Celtic, 35 goals 2000-01 The Swede joined Barca in 2004 on a free transfer and while not posting incredible scoring figures added a dimension to the team. He got 19 goals in 58 games and won two La Liga titles and the Champions League.

Thierry Henry, Arsenal, 30 goals 2003-04

The Frenchman also won the award in 2005 after scoring 25 goals for Arsenal before moving to the Nou Camp in 2007 for £16million. He won a treble of the Liga, Spanish Cup and Champions League in 2009.
