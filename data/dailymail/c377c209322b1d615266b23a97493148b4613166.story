Luis Figo is proposing an expansion of the World Cup finals as part of his FIFA presidential manifesto which launched at Wembley Stadium on Thursday.

The tournament's current format involves 32 teams but Figo wants to add eight or 16 more, with a focus on more teams from outside of Europe getting to the finals stage.

The former Portugal international also said a greater percentage of FIFA's income should be spent on grassroots development.

- Expand the World Cup from 32 to '40 or 48' teams.

- Possibility of changing World Cup format to include two 24-team tournaments across two tournaments before knockout stages in one country.

- Trial the use of 'sin bins' to be used for players showing dissent to referees. 

- Distribute more of FIFA's revenue towards grassroots football.

- Revert the offside rule to including all players in offside positions as offside, regardless of their impact on play. 

'I believe we should consider proposals to expand the competition to a 40 or even 48 team World Cup,' Figo told the press conference at Wembley. 

'Both these options are feasible with an extra three to four days of tournament play. If this expansion were to take place I believe that additional teams should come from non-European nations.'

Figo, who played in two World Cup finals with Portugal, also offered up the option of the tournament being played on more than one continent in future.

The former Barcelona and Real Madrid star suggested that FIFA could even stage two 24-team group competitions simultaneously on the two continents before the knockout stages would be held in one country. 

Figo also pledged to pump more money into grassroots football if he is to be elected as president

The election takes place at the FIFA congress in Zurich on May 29 where Figo will take on Sepp Blatter

Figo wants to see sin bins introduced on a trial basis for players who are abusive towards referees

He also wants trials for 'sin bins' where players could be temporarily removed from play for unsporting behaviour towards referees - and wants a more concrete definition of the offside rule to include a system where players can be offside regardless of their involvement in play 

Figo is one of three men challenging incumbent Sepp Blatter. Michael Van Praag, the president of the Dutch FA, and Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, a member of the FIFA executive committee, are also standing.

Blatter remains the odds-on favourite to keep hold of the role at the head of world football's governing body, but Figo believes the desire for change after investigations into corruption will help swing opinion his way.

Figo's former team-mate David Beckham said: 'I welcome the candidacy of my friend Luis for Fifa president.

'Any successful organisation needs to have good people who are passionate about the game and want to do the best for fans. I wish Luis and the other candidates well.'

Blatter remains the odds-on favourite to keep hold of the role at the head of world football's governing body, but Figo believes the desire for change after investigations into corruption will help swing opinion his way. 

'This image we are aware of this organisation that leads football is not the appropriate image,' he said. 'I trust that most  want change and are ready for change, a democratic change, a change so that we achieve transparency and a change that goes back to football itself.' 

Blatter is yet to launch any campaign manifesto ahead of the election but already has the support of the federations of Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania.

The election takes place at the FIFA congress in Zurich on May 29.
