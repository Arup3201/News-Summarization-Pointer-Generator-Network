An alleged stalker who is convinced he is married to Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan should return to Germany for psychiatric treatment, a court heard today.

Daniel Vorderwulbecke, 37, is accused of harassing the star, bombarding her with thousands of disturbing texts, Tweets and Instagram pictures.

Vorderwulbecke is also alleged to have attacked a doorman and smashed a bin worth £100 in the bout of chaos at the Palace Theatre in central London, where the star is appearing in the satirical play Speed-The-Plow.

Since his arrest Vorderwulbecke has been treated for mental health issues at a London hospital, and is described as 'acutely unwell.'

Vorderwulbecke is yet to enter formal pleas to charges of harassment without violence, assault causing actual bodily harm to doorman Cameron Ashraf and criminal damage.

It is claimed Vorderwulbecke stalked Miss Lohan for seven weeks between July and September this year by bombarding her with threats in person and through 'various communication devices' including Instagram.

On September 8, police were called to the Playhouse Theatre, where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at £100.

Vorderwulbecke is also alleged to have attacked a doorman and smashed a bin worth £100 in the bout of chaos at the theatre where the star is appearing in the satirical play Speed-The-Plow (pictured)

Claims: The charges say Vorderwulbecke damaged a bin at the Playhouse Theatre (pictured), where the play is currently showing, before returning three days later and having an altercation with the doorman

Three days later, on September 11, he allegedly assaulted Mr Ashrat after he was barred from watching the actress rehearse.

He did not attend Westminster Magistrates' Court today but Lucy Daniels, defending, said psychiatric reports indicate his condition is 'improving.'

She added: 'The doctor believes Mr Voderwulbecke is better off being treated in Germany [his homeland].'

Vorderwulbecke - who also uses the names DJ Dan Cortez and King Lionheart - is also alleged to have used Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to bombard the actress with declarations of love

Vorderwulbecke - who also uses the names DJ Dan Cortez and King Lionheart - had also used Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to bombard the actress with declarations of love, it is claimed.

He also allegedly entered the theatre where she was performing.

Earlier, prosecutor Darren Watts told the court Voderwulbecke believes he is married to Lohan.

Vorderwulbecke was said to have dropped off various items for Lohan at the theatre, including purported 'marriage certificates'.

Lohan, 28, was said to have been left distressed after receiving 'thousands of text messages' from the German.

Vorderwulbecke is due to remain at the specialist Gordon Hospital in Pimlico until a plea and case management hearing at the same court next Thursday.
