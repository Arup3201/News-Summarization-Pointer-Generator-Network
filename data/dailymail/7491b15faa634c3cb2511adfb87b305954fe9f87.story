Probe: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for a police investigation into the Stafford Hospital Scandal

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for a police investigation over the Stafford Hospital scandal which led to the deaths of up to 1,200 people.

An inquiry into the trust this week reported a ‘disaster’ in the care of vulnerable and elderly patients at the hospital and said it revealed failings at every level of the NHS.

Mr Hunt said it was wrong that nobody had been ‘brought to book’ at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust in the wake of the report.

‘I think it’s absolutely outrageous that potentially more than a thousand people lost their lives because of poor care and not a single person has been brought to book,’ he said.

‘This was a public inquiry that was designed to help us understand why the system didn’t pick up what went wrong but I think it is absolutely disgraceful with all those things happening, whether it is doctors, nurses or managers, nobody has been held to account.’

Asked whether the information should be passed to the police, he added: ‘Well that evidence is in the public domain.

And you know, it’s there for the police - and it’s there for the professional bodies, the GMC (General Medical Council) and the NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) to look at and they should do that.’

Mr Hunt said that it was not for him to judge which individuals should be prosecuted.

‘As a politician, I am not in a 
position to say this nurse is guilty, this nurse is not, and all these 
things have to be decided at arm’s length following due process,’ he 
told the Daily Telegraph.

‘This is about people’s careers and livelihood and there has to be fairness of course.’

Scandal: An inquiry found up to 1,200 patients died on casualty wards at Stafford between 2005 and 2009 due to an obsession with targets

Robert Francis QC, who led the 
inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said there were
failings at every level of the NHS and that the culture among 
healthcare staff must change.

He said: ‘What we need to avoid is yet another wholesale reorganisation of abolishing organisations and creating new ones.

Sir David Nicholson, the head of the NHS, has resisted calls to step down over the scandal at Stafford Hospital

‘This is about how people behave when
they go to work and their ability to raise concerns and be honest about
what’s going on in their hospitals.’

The
change would only happen when NHS managers, clinicians and staff 
started to address the failings ‘rather than waiting to be told what to 
do from Whitehall, or by the top of the NHS,’ he added.

Sir David Nicholson, the head of the NHS, has resisted calls to step down over the scandal at Stafford Hospital.

Heather
Wood, who headed an earlier investigation into the hospital in 2009, 
said: ‘If this were a private sector organisation that had failed to 
such an extent, we would be calling for the boss to take responsibility.

‘There is a big case to answer for the creation of that culture.’

Patients’
campaigner Julie Bailey, whose elderly mother Bella died at Stafford 
hospital, called for individuals in the NHS to be held accountable for 
the failings in care.

She said: ‘This is an opportunity to put down the gauntlet and say enough is enough.

‘From today you will be held accountable for your actions - it’s no good saying in the future you will be held accountable.

‘We want accountability for the hundreds of deaths and the suffering our loved ones had to put up with.’

NHS
medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh has launched a review into 
five other trusts where there were 3,000 more deaths than expected 
between 2010 and 2012.

A whistleblower at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital today urged others in similar situations to act as she did.

Helene Donnelly, a former casualty nurse at the hospital, said healthcare workers who saw poor care had a duty to speak out.

Asked on BBC Breakfast whether she would have blown the whistle if she 
had known that nobody would be disciplined over what happened, she said:

'Just because you think nothing's going to happen doesn't mean you 
don't try, and that would be my message to other nurses out there right 
now, who may be in a very similar situation, that if they're witnessing 
poor standards of care, they have a duty to speak out.'

She said the report by Robert Francis QC into the Mid Staffordshire NHS 
Foundation Trust had highlighted that there may be a legal obligation to
report wrongdoing.

'But I think it goes much further. The Francis report can only go so 
far, it's up now to the individuals and organisations to take that 
forward to implement change.'

Ms Donnelly said that people should be held accountable for their actions.

'I think individuals have to be accountable for their own behaviour, and
from a nursing point of view, you have a duty of care for your 
patients, and if you are not delivering that, and particularly if you 
are doing harm, you need to be made accountable.'

Asked if there had been a culture of neglect at the hospital, she said: 'There was, and there was a culture of bullying as well, both towards 
staff and patients.'

She said there were 'immense' pressures on the nurses.

'We were hugely understaffed, and had very poor equipment, inadequate 
equipment, and that obviously led to the nurses being under immense 
pressure, and there was pressure to always meet the four hour accident 
and emergency ward target. That had a knock on effect to patient care.'
