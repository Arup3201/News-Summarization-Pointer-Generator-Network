Arsene Wenger was confronted by an angry fan, believed to be an Arsenal supporter, towards the end of his side's defeat to Southampton.

The supporter was hauled away by two stewards after he managed to get right in front of Wenger and assistant manager Steve Bould and was later arrested by police.

Southampton believe the man was an Arsenal fan who had bought a ticket amongst the home supporters.

Arsene Wenger feels the strain as Arsenal succumbed to a two-goal defeat against Southampton 

Wenger was confronted by an angry fan during the poor performance at St Mary's on New Year's Day

Wenger claimed afterwards that it was a Southampton fan and that he did not hear what was shouted at him.

But the fan, wearing a purple hoody, jeans and white trainers, clearly gesticulated at Wenger and Bould as they sat in the away dugout at St Mary's.

The pair waved him away before he was grabbed by the stewards and escorted down the St Mary's tunnel.

Southampton were last night reviewing CCTV footage of the incident, which occurred in the final 10 minutes of the game, and are prepared to take the severest action against the supporter.

'It was a young boy,' Wenger said. 'I think he was Southampton fan. He was not aggressive at all. I don’t think he said anything.'

Stewards quickly led the man away, and Wenger showed little reaction to the confrontation

Last month a group of Arsenal supporters confronted Wenger at Stoke-on-Trent train station after they lost to there. They booed and shouted expletives at him.

Arsenal fans are clearly growing frustrated with Wenger. The defeat on Thursday left them fifth, three points behind Southampton in fourth.

Lukas Podolski is also set to leave the club with his transfer to Inter Milan expected to be complete this weekend.

The forward was not available for the match against Southampton carrying a groin injury but negotiations between the two clubs are nearing a conclusion.

'Look the first proposal was farcical,' Wenger added. 'After they come back a bit more serious then we will see what happens. Inevitable in a transfer is very difficult to say but we’ll see what happens.'

Dusan Tadic capitalises on another mistake from Szczesny to scores Southampton's second

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman admitted that Arsenal gifted them the second goal when Wojciech Szczesny kicked the ball straight to Dusan Tadic to prod in from close range.

'I don't like to talk about mistakes of the opponent but the second goal was maybe a New Year present,' Koeman said.

'This result show we can beat a big team, like Arsenal is. The draw against Chelsea was important, after that the players had the belief to win something. We are learning.'
