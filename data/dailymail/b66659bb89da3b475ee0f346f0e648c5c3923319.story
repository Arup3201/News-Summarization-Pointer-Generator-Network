A mother's dying wish has been fulfilled after her three children got married in a triple wedding ceremony.

Emma and Sarah Bond and their brother Paul Charman fought back tears as each tied the knot in the absence of their mother Marjorie.

The 73-year-old, who had helped organise her children's big days, sadly died after losing her battle with cancer and didn't get to see the siblings walk down the aisle.Â

However, before she passed away on May 26 at her home in South Shields, Tyneside, she made it her last wish that the siblings should go ahead with the wedding that she had helped to plan.

The emotional triple wedding - which saw the siblings walk down the aisle to the sound of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' - took place in Newcastle on Friday.

And in a tribute to their late mother, a table in the wedding room displayed her picture.

Office worker Sarah, 30, of South Shields, who married her partner Kevin Graham, 33, a worker at Nissan, said: 'It has been quite upsetting and nerve-wracking.

'It was a special day for all of us but we have all felt there has been something missing.'

Their father Mike, 66, a retired offshore worker, who walked both Emma and Sarah down the aisle, said: 'I am so pleased the day has gone well for them all.

'It has been very emotional just knowing how much Marjorie wanted this and knowing she's not here.

'I just told them to just do it the way mam would have wanted and they did, I'm really proud of them.'

The ceremony also saw Paul, 49, tie the knot with Melanie Talbot, 39, who run a joint carpet and garage business, and nursery nurse Emma, 34, marry her partner Bill Thompson, 55.

Melanie, who lost her father John in 2009, carried a photo of him in her garter in order that he too could be part of the wedding.

Esther Ward, who helped to organise the unique ceremony, said the day was a great tribute to 73-year-old Marjorie.

'It has just been different,' she said.

'It has been emotional, no words can really describe it.'
