A personal note from Margaret Thatcher thanking her husband Denis and her family for their love and support during her political career, has been found inside a copy of her autobiography.

The letter fell out of a copy of ‘The Downing Street Years' which surfaced at a secondhand bookshop in Wismar, north Germany this week.

The note does not have a signature but has been hand written on Baroness Thatcher's personal crested House of Lords notepaper.

Shop owner Katja Burmester, says she found the copy whilst sorting through a box of books she had bought as a job lot.

‘It really looks like it was her private letter paper,’ Mrs Burmester said.

'I imagine it was one of 20 or 30 copies Mrs Thatcher gave away to friends and family. That makes it all the rarer.'

The letter contains an acknowledgement to the love of her husband Denis, who has widely been credited as the strength behind the former Prime Minister during some of her toughest crises, and it also gives thanks to 10 Downing Street staff.

The letter reads: ‘To my husband and family, without whose love and encouragement I should never have become Prime Minister.

‘And
 to all those who worked at 10 Downing Street and Chequers in whatever 
capacity, whose unfailing support was crucial in those challenging 
years.’

Katja Burmester says she has no idea who was the original recipient of the book containing Mrs Thatcher's letter, nor how the rare book ended up in her shop.

‘People bring me boxes of all sorts of books when they move, or when someone dies,’ she said.

’I buy them, and then sort through to find the interesting ones which I can sell. I don't even know how long I've had this for.

‘But it is a bit special, I hope to sell it now, to the highest bidder,’ she added.
