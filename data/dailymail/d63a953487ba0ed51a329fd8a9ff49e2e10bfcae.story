One baby is born through IVF to lesbian parents almost every day in the UK, new figures have revealed.

The numbers from 2012 – the most recent available – show that 348 babies were born to women recorded as having a female partner.

This is a 14-fold increase on the 25 such babies born in 2003, according to the statistics from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.

In total, over the ten-year period, IVF treatment clinics have helped bring 1,388 children into the world for lesbian couples.

In addition, the HFEA said that over the same ten-year timespan 1,149 children were born through IVF to single women.

However, the official numbers are considered an underestimate of the real total, as more children will have been conceived by single and lesbian mums with the help of donor insemination – much of which takes place outside regulated clinics. 

These latest figures from the HFEA reveal that almost 1,000 lesbian mums underwent IVF treatment in 2012 in a bid to become a mother.

In 2003, just 77 women recorded as having a female partner underwent IVF treatment, resulting in 25 babies. 

By 2012, this number surged to 916 would-be lesbian mothers, who successfully gave birth to 348 babies.

The number of lesbian couples having this type of fertility treatment has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, with much of it being funded by the NHS.

The law was liberalised in 2008 to make it easier for two women to have children via IVF, by removing the obligation for clinics to consider the need for a father figure for the potential child. 

And in 2013, NHS rules were changed so that women in same-sex relationships with proven infertility could access state-funded fertility treatment. 

Before then, lesbian couples had to pay privately, at an estimated cost of around £15,000.

A spokesman for the gay rights charity Stonewall said: ‘We think it’s fantastic that even more children are being conceived in safe and supportive environments, and into loving families, since the ban on lesbians using fertility clinics was lifted.’

But some campaigners have warned of the dangers of a generation of fatherless children.

Dr Trevor Stammers, a trustee of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘The large recent increase in children born to mothers with a same sex partner at the time of the birth is concerning, in the light of a number of recent research studies which have shown – for example – a four-fold increase in emotional problems in children of same-sex parents, compared with children raised by both their biological parents.’
