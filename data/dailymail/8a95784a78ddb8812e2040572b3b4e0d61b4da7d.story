Sales of celebrity cookbooks have risen by 250% this year alone

Hairy Bikers knocked E.L James off number one bestsellers lists

Jamie Oliver is Britain’s second biggest-selling author since records began – with total book sales of £126m

From Nigella Lawson's food porn bibles to silver fox Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry baking up a storm on The Great British Bake Off, cooking has never been cooler.

But while sales of celebrity cookbooks have risen by 250 per cent this year alone, one in 10 Brits admit to never even opening the ones they buy.

Half say that they own more than four books but only pull them off the shelf when they need to make ‘something special’.

Although sales of cookbooks are on the rise, one in ten of us admit to never even opening them

And a time-poor five per cent claimed 
that while they own a mountain of cookbooks, they don't spend any time 
in the kitchen at all. 

But despite the fact their spines remain unbroken and their recipes untested, it transpires that these beautifully designed, mouthwatering reads are beginning to eclipse other bestsellers.

The diet cookbook from The Hairy Bikers, for example, has aroused enough interest to knock Fifty Shades Of Grey off the bestsellers lists.

Jamie Oliver is now the second most valuable author of all time, missing out to just J.K Rowling

But despite half of Brits showcasing impressive cookbooks on their shelves, findings reveal that the meals most regularly cooked are traditional classics like spaghetti bolognese (60 per cent), meat and two veg-style roast dinners (54 per cent) and sausage and mash (48 per cent), with only a handful of Brits regularly taking on more exotic dishes such as Thai curry (16 per cent) or paella (10 per cent).

The nation's favourite cuisines ranked as Italian (20 per cent), Indian (18 per cent), British fish and chips (17 per cent) and Chinese (15 per cent), however, only 30 per cent of those polled had tried to cook one of their favourite cuisines at home - and a naughty one in ten lied to friends about trying a certain cuisine or ingredients.

With the help of celebrity chefs like Heston Blumenthal and Nigella Lawson, sales of celebrity cookbooks have soared by 250 per cent

The Great British Bake Off has become a firm favourite in the nation¿s homes

And it isn't just cookbooks
 that are drawing in cooking aficionados, over a quarter of British 
foodies admit to tuning in to at least two food programmes a week, with 
Masterchef and Great British Bake Off being firm favourites in the 
nation’s homes.

Not that the nation's TV addiction is rubbing off on their domestic ambitions: despite immersing themselves in celebrity cook books and TV shows, when quizzed on how long they spend preparing and cooking meals, 78 per cent said they managed to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner in less than 30 minutes.

Jason Gissing, co-founder of Ocado, who 
carried out the research, said: 'We know that Brits love to buy all of 
the latest celebrity cookery books and enjoy watching recipes being 
created on TV, but many of us just don’t have the time to recreate 
delicious meals for ourselves.'

Ocado also predicts that cookbooks are set to
 be a staple stocking filler this festive season, including the new 
titles from Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson and Heston Blumenthal.

Jamie Oliver was recently named as Britain’s second 
biggest-selling author since records began – with total book sales of 
£126 million.

The 
Essex-born television chef and school meals campaigner, who has sold 
more than 10 million cook books, is ranked second only to Harry Potter 
author J K Rowling.

Father-of-four Oliver, 37, who is famous
for his ‘Pukka’ catchphrase and whose bestsellers include The Naked 
Chef and Jamie’s 30 Minute Meals, is joined on the bestseller list by 
some of his culinary rivals.

Delia Smith is in tenth place, Nigella Lawson is ranked 19th and Gordon Ramsay is towards the bottom of the chart at 45.

Together, the four chefs account for a tasty 40 per cent of all the cook books sold  in Britain since records began in 1998.

Despite our passion for cookbooks we stick to traditional classics like spaghetti bolognese, 'meat
