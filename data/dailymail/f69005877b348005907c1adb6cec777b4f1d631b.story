Hero: The 20-year-old barman dresses up as superhero up to three times a week, before heading off to hand out food to the homeless in Birmingham

A real-life Spider-Man has started scaling the streets of a city centre to help the homeless and needy - but, just like his inspiration, he says he will never be unmasked.

The 20-year-old hands out sandwiches to Birmingham's homeless wearing the distinctive lycra costume - and a pair of trainers - up to three times a week. 

But the real-life hero says he will not reveal his identity, just like the popular Marvel comic book star.

The barman claims all he wants to do is draw attention to the plight of the vulnerable - and he will never be unmasked.

He said: 'People always say I look like Peter Parker (the high school student behind the mask) when I wear my reading glasses. 

'The first time I went out, the people I handed the sandwiches to had a massive smile in their face.

'Passers-by would ask for a photo, when I told them what I was doing, they would say that's really cool.

'People have said they were going to go out with their friends and do the same. People have posted on Twitter, could I go to Coventry and do it?'

'People have asked to contribute to the sandwiches but I've got enough money to do this. I want to see them go out themselves and do it.'

The do-gooder, who is single and originally from Water Orton, Warwickshire, added: 'I've had to the classic thing of buying a sandwich usually from Tesco in normal clothes and then go up an alley and change into my Spider-Man outfit.

'It sounds surreal. When I go home, I have to look in the mirror and say "I'm not Spider-Man".'

The dedicated helper has lived all over Birmingham and has been assisting the homeless and vulnerable since he was 17, when he joined a city centre church group distributing food in the area.

He said: 'I noticed we would get a lot of people coming up after we had run out of food.

'I thought why don't we go out a lot later at night because people are still out and asking for spare change - they obviously don't have anywhere to go.'

'At the start of 2014, I used to see people who had almost passed out from the cold and people walking straight past them.

'There was a disconnect like there weren't real people. I thought it would be quite demoralising to sit there with people not looking at you.

'Even when I had nothing to give them, I used to talk to them. At least it was something for them.'

Impact: The mysterious hero revealed: 'The response has been amazing - there is an instant wow factor'

The Spider-Man fan, who even has his own Twitter feed - @brumspiderman - so people can follow his adventures, already had his costume left over from a birthday party.

He added: 'The response has been amazing - there is an instant wow factor.

'People have seen me on Facebook or Twitter and they say what I am doing is really good. Some are even saying they want to do the same.

'I plan to do it for as long as I can.'
