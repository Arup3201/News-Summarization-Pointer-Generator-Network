A husband has been forced to issue a grovelling apology to his estranged wife every day for 30 days on Facebook after posting a furious message about her on the social networking site.

In leaving the hate-filled rant, Mark Byron breached a court order protecting his wife, Elizabeth, and their son after he was convicted of civil domestic violence against her last year.

According to court records, he said: 'If you are an evil, vindictive woman who wants to ruin your husband's life and take your son's father away from him completely - all you need to do is say that you're scared of your husband or domestic partner and they'll take him away!'

The Cincinnati photographer also posted a
picture of his son, Jonathon, which Mrs Byron somehow saw, along with comments 
from friends, even though she was blocked from the page, he said.

Magistrate Paul Meyers ruled last 
month Byron had violated the protection order preventing him from 
'causing plaintiff or the child of the parties to suffer physical and/or
mental abuse, harassment, annoyance or bodily injury.'

He
has now been told he must leave a lengthy message expressing his 
penitence on his Facebook page for 30 days or face 60 days in prison and $500 fine, it
was reported on WLWT.com.

The message, which was posted on February 13, could not be taken down for 30 days.

Byron must also grant friend status to his wife or anyone else wanting access, Meyers ruled.

Speaking to WLWT.com, Byron said he left the original message in frustration over his impending divorce and child visitation.

'I post on Facebook to vent things,' 
he said yesterday. I liken it to having a drink in a bar with a friend 
and telling them how I feel.

'On
one hand, the court wants to stop me from saying something on Facebook,
then it's telling me I have to (post) the pre-written apology.'

Byron,
who claims his wife painted an unfair picture of him in a domestic 
relations court, must also pay back outstanding child support in order 
to avoid the jail term.

'I would like to apologize to my wife, Elizabeth Byron, for the comments regarding her and our son ... which were posted on my Facebook wall on or about November 23, 2011.

'I hereby acknowledge that two judicial officials in the Hamilton County Domestic Relations Court have heard evidence and determined that I committed an act of domestic violence against Elizabeth on January 17, 2011.

'While that determination is currently being appealed, it has not been overturned by the appellate court.Â 

'As a result of that determination, I was granted supervised parenting time with (my son) on a twice weekly basis.

'The reason I saw (my son) only one time during the four-month period which ended about the time of my Facebook posting was because I chose to see him on only that single occasion during that period.

'I hereby apologize to Elizabeth for casting her in an unfavorable light by suggesting that she withheld (my son) from me or that she in any manner prevented me from seeing (my son) during that period. That decision was mine and mine alone.

'I further apologize to all my Facebook Friends for attempting to mislead them into thinking that Elizabeth was in any manner preventing me from spending time with (my son), which caused several of my Facebook Friends to respond with angry, venomous, and inflammatory comments of their own.'
