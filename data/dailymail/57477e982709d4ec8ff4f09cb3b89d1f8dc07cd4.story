The United States has asked Australia to step up its efforts in the global fight to stop Ebola, which has so far claimed 5,000 lives.

Washington has asked the Abbott government to build three field hospitals in West Africa and to send at least 100 doctors and support workers to staff them, reports Fairfax media. 

The Abbott government has been reluctant to send Australian medics to the region to date, citing a lack of appropriate treatment facilities and evacuation arrangements for Australians who might contract the virus. 

It is understood Washington has requested on Thursday that Australia also contribute an extra $30 million to the United Nations Ebola fund  and that it provide helicopters for evacuations, ground vehicles, emergency communications equipment and logistics support.

Amidst criticism for being too slow to respond to the epidemic this week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament:  'I certainly do not rule out Australia doing more.'

A spokesman for Mr Abbott said Friday that the government was 'continuing to discuss with our friends and partners, including the USA and the UK, our response to addressing the situation in West Africa.'

Australia has contributed about $18 million towards the crisis so far.

But the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, has this week hit out at nations that she says are not pulling their weight in the fight against Ebola.

'This is a crisis that is so vast, with needs so great, with potential consequences so dire that no country can afford to stand on the sidelines. A few are doing a lot. But a lot are doing very little, or nothing at all,' said Ms Power  after a tour of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea this week.

The US-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has called the Ebola epidemic the 'largest in history': It has so far infected 14,000 people and killed about 5,000, with the number of cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone doubling every 20 days. 

Critics of the Abbott government's handling of the crisis say news that a new US-managed field hospital for international health staff in Liberia is just days from opening, means Australia has 'no more excuses.'

'Now we know there are treatment centres being built we should send people because many health workers are ready and willing to go,' says president of the Australian Medical Association, Brian Owler, who has been urging the government to ramp up its response for weeks.

Deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek, who met with senior US government officials this week to discuss the global response to the outbreak, says Australia must act immediately. 

'If the Abbott government is serious about helping to get this crisis under control, there isn't a moment to lose – it must immediately act on requests from our international partners to step up and do more,' said Ms Plibersek. 

Fairfax reports that Washington has also offered to train Australians at a US Defence facility in Monrovia, Liberia and through its health agency, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.

According to Labor health spokeswoman Catherine King, division within cabinet was the reason behind the government's inaction, despite public support.

A Morgan Poll this week showed 70 per cent of Australians support the sending of health workers to West Africa.

Last week, Ethiopia announced it will send 200 health professionals to West Africa and Nigeria has committed 600 health staff. Cuba has already deployed 256 doctors across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and China announced on Friday that it would send 480 medical staff and build a 100-bed treatment centre in Liberia.
