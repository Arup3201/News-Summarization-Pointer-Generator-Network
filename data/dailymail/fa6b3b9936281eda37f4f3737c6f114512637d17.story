The SS United States was the last of the golden age of trans-Atlantic cruise ships, 107 feet longer than the Titanic and 50 percent faster than the ill-fated luxury liner.

From its maiden voyage in 1952, the SS United States operated for 17 glorious years and the massive ship still holds the prestigious Blue Riband - for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing by a passenger liner.

Although never in active naval service, the ship played a vital role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and became a symbol of American power during the Cold War.

Now slowly rusting away in a south Philadelphia mooring, the ship which was known as the unofficial flagship of the nation is now at the heart of ambitious redevelopment plans to restore it to its former glory and convert it to a floating hotel.

Saved from a date with the scrap yard in February of last year, a local philanthropist's $5.8 million gift allowed the SS United States Conservancy to buy it and keep it afloat until November 2012.

With that date looming, the nonprofit conservancy has launched a 'Save the United States' drive to mark the 50th anniversary of her launch and her claiming of the Blue Riband.

The conservancy has raised about $6 million so far but needs $25 million to restore the exterior and part of the interior to house a museum, restaurants and a hotel said Susan Gibbs, conservancy executive director and the granddaughter of William Francis Gibbs, the ship's Philadelphia-born designer.

The goal is to spark interest, raise public awareness and literally get investors on board.

'The SS United States is America's 
flagship. It symbolizes the very best that this nation has produced,' 
she said. 'It is going to once again be an amazing icon for the nation 
to appreciate and enjoy.'

The fundraising campaign includes a new interactive website, which allows donors to 'purchase' a piece of the ship for $1 per square inch for themselves or in honor of someone else.

They can choose the section they want to sponsor by scrolling and zooming around a virtual model on the website, 'meet' other donors throughout the ship, personalize and upload images andmemories of the ship, and share it through social media sites.

“This is living history. Once this ship is gone, it will never be replaced. It is the last of the American ocean liners. It was built in Newport News. We cannot lose this ship,” said Dan McSweeney who is on the SS United States Conservancy and a commercial developer.

The 990-foot-long ocean liner, which 
transported patrons across the Atlantic with both elegance and muscle, 
has spent the bulk of its life in a nomadic existence plagued by 
shifting owners, dashed hopes and close calls with the scrap yard.

But even in its humbled state, the ship newspapers once feted as 'the greatest shipbuilding effort in the history of this country' and 'the most revolutionary modern superliner in the world' still remains an awe-inspiring sight even to those who remember it from its heyday.

'The engineering, the beauty, the service, the safety - this was the best, the best in the world, none of the ships could compare with it,' Joe Rota, who worked on the ship in the 1950s, said during a recent visit aboard the United States. 'And it would be an absolute tragedy to lose it.'

The $5.8 million donation from cable TV mogul H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest, whose naval architect father designed parts of the SS United States, saved the ship from a likely scrapping and allowed the conservancy to buy the ship from Norwegian Cruise Lines in February 2011 and pay for 20 months of docking and related costs.

The conservancy's redevelopment arm is exploring potential partnerships with entities inPhiladelphia, New York and Miami to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with a hotel, theater, restaurants and shopping but the clock is winding down along with the money from Lenfest's gift.

'The three areas that have expressed an interest in this are Miami, New York, and greater Philadelphia. However, we recently heard from a group that is very preliminarily interested in looking at the ship in Norfolk,' said Dan McSweeney, commercial developer.

'What you see here is kind of discouraging but ... you could scrape this down and you could repaint it, and when we light the lights at night on occasion she's absolutely gorgeous again,' said Rota

'And we could have that again. ... This would be an attraction the whole world would want to come and take part in again.'

Commissioned as a joint venture between the Navy and ship designer Gibbs & Cox, the $78 million liner's luxury cloaked its military might. Though never called to battle, it could have been converted in a single day to transport 14,000 troops for 10,000 miles without refueling.

The once-great liner is still the holder of the Blue Riband for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing which it set in July of 1952

Instead it carried more than 1 million passengers across the Atlantic over the course of 400 round trips, among them President John F. Kennedy, Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Salvador Dali, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco, and England's King Edward VIII.

In 1968, Bill Clinton traveled tourist-class en route to Oxford University.

The liner's glory days were short-lived as air travel rose in popularity, however, and the United States was taken out of service in 1969.

It changed hands multiple times, from the Navy and on through a series of restoration-minded investors. It was unceremoniously towed from Virginia to Turkey to Ukraine, finally arriving in Philadelphia as a gutted hulk.

Another succession of developers and a cruise line failed to return the ship to service as retrofitting costs proved too great.

The ship is still the only man-made object within America to bear the name United States

'It's been 60 years since I first set foot on this ship with my mother ... it's very exciting,' said Louise Meiere Dunn, 82, of Stamford, Conn., who stood recently on the promenade where she danced the conga on the maiden voyage, when the United States set a new trans-Atlantic record from New York to England: 3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes.

The record that still stands for a conventional passenger ocean liner.

'We understood there was going to be some sort of celebration when we were going to break the record,' Dunn said. 'We went out on deck ... but the weather was so foul we came back here and found it on the promenade deck.'

She recalled with a laugh that she and the other young people on board partied until breakfast, which they ate while still in their evening gowns and black tie from the night before. Several weeks later, a friend in India saw her dancing the conga on a movie newsreel.

'I'm hoping that this ship can be revived, repurposed,' she said. 'It would be wonderful to see this promenade deck being used again - and having a conga line, maybe.'
