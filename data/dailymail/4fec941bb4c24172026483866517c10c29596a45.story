The Ballon d’Or is awarded to the world’s best player in Zurich on Monday but I am far more interested in who is named coach of the year.

Carlo Ancelotti, for securing Real Madrid’s 10th Champions League, and World Cup winner Joachim Low will have their supporters but if it was down to me, the prize would go to the third man on the shortlist — Diego Simeone.

His work with Atletico Madrid, which was crowned by winning La Liga last season, has been unbelievable for the past three years and I watched in awe again on Wednesday night when he inspired his side in the Copa del Rey to a third consecutive victory over Real.

A 2-0 victory over rivals Real on Wednesday was Atletico's third straight Madrid derby win

That is three straight derby wins after losing the Champions League final to their neighbours. You would have thought losing in Lisbon would have had a psychological impact on Atleti but nothing could be further from the truth.

Simeone is the type of manager you would run through a brick wall for — I’d even come out of retirement for him! — and you can see his squad have total belief in him. He would be a magnificent addition to our game.

In some ways, Atleti remind me of the Liverpool sides I played for under Rafa Benitez and Gerard Houllier. We might not have been the easiest on the eye but we had absolute belief that wherever we went in Europe we would get a result. Simeone has given that to Atleti.
