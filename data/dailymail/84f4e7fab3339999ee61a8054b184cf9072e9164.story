Maryland officials are investigating the death of an inmate who was found dead in his steam-filled prison cell.

Louis Stanley Leysath III, 35, was serving a life sentence for a 2008 murder in Jessup Correctional Institution after strangling his then girlfriend to death, when he was found dead on Friday morning, according to prison spokesman Mark Vernarelli.

Correctional staff performed CPR on him, but Leysath was pronounced dead a short time later.

Leysath was housed alone in the cell where there was no fire nor foul play suspected, and it is unclear whether the death was accidental or a suicide, said Vernarelli.

He pleaded guilty in 2010 to first degree murder in Charles County Circuit Court and was sentenced for a May 14, 2008 killing, according to the Baltimore Sun.

The incident involved his then girlfriend, Jasmine Nicole Clark, 23, who was found dead covered in a blanket inside of her Waldorf apartment after a domestic dispute with Leysath about the use of her car.

Clark's daughters, aged seven and three at the time, who were at the house during the dispute, discovered their mother's body on the floor with a ligature around her neck, according to Southern Maryland News.

Leysath stole Clark's car following the incident as he left the apartment, and a 911 call with the seven-year-old girl reported her saying: 'My mom, she won't wake up.' 

The inmate was later arrested at his parent's home after they reported  their son being disorderly and possibly under the influence of drugs.

When police arrived at the parent's home, Leysath was attacking both his mother and father, according to police, and they eventually linked him to Clark's murder. 

During Leysath's trial, his attorney said that his client had committed the act 'while in a psychotic state' which was brought on by 14 years of PCP abuse.

Leysath's death has been reported as occurring 'under unusual circumstance', and the investigation continues (above the Jessup Correctional Institution)

In a statement released to Daily Mail Online by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, it said that the department did not provide any information on Leysath's death until officials had located and spoken personally to his family on Saturday.

Secretary Stephen Moyer has ordered a thorough administrative review in addition to the death investigation in order to determine whether staff acted appropriately in the hours before the inmate was found.

The statement also said due to the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation and the incomplete autopsy results, no further information is available at this time, but that the department will update the case as soon as possible.
