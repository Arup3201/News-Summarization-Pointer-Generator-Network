The Academy Awards have been accused of being stuffy and boring but Ellen DeGeneres was determined to bring them up to date on Sunday.

The chat show host and prolific tweeter took what is being described as the 'best selfie ever' during her hosting duties, a picture which started off as just her and Meryl Streep but soon expanded to include Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Spacey in a picture taken by Bradley Cooper.

Multi-tasking Ellen then shared the snap on her Twitter page, where it broke the record for most retweets, with 1,076,971 in less than an hour as social media fans went wild for the snap, while continuing to host the show.

However, it did appear as if the picture was part of a promotional stunt for Samsung, which is a big sponsor of the show, as the selfie was taken with her Samsung Galaxy Note 3, a device which she whipped out at various stages during the proceedings.

The selfie that broke Twitter: Ellen DeGeneres' selfie with stars Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Meryl Streep (using her Oscars sponsor Samsung Galaxy phone) crashed the social networking site after it was retweeted 2 million times

It was just one in a series of fun moments as Ellen won over the celebrity crowd at the Academy Awards with some gentle teasing but one person was less than impressed.

While Jennifer took jokes about falling over on the red carpet in her stride and Jared Leto laughed as Ellen dubbed him 'the prettiest of them all', Liza Minnelli looked less than impressed when Ellen quipped she thought she was a male impersonator.

Taking to the stage at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre, seven years after she last presented, Ellen joked: 'The real Captain Philips is here tonight
 and the real Philomena and one of the most impressive Liza Minnelli 
impersonators I've ever seen in my entire life. Good job sir. That is 
seriously impressive.'

Get it together; Ellen worked to get all of the celebrities together for the sot and they were all eager to get involved

Group hug: The entire group huddled up close as they all tried to get themselves into the picture on the phone

What about me? Poor Liza was too short to make it into the epic selfie

While the audience and Liza's sister 
Lorna Luft howled with laughter, Liza looked less than amused and merely
 cracked a small smile.

Apart from a less than warm reception from Minnelli, DeGeneres won over the A-list crowd with her gentle opening monologue.

She opened with a quip about the recent rain in Hollywood and the inability of everyone to cope with it: 'For those of you 
watching around the world, it has been a tough couple of  days for us, 
it's been raining. We're fine. Thank you for your prayers.'

She also gently ribbed the academy for not deviating very much in their voting patterns.

Most star-studded selfie ever? Stars including Jared Leto, Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Street along with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie got involved int he snap taken by Bradley Cooper

Ellen joked: 'Things
 are so different now. For example last time I was here Leonardo 
DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese were 
nominated. Soooo different.'

She
 teased 84-year-old nominee June Squibb about her age, saying: 'There 
are some first time nominees here – June Squibb is nominated for 
Nebraska. At 84 years old she is the oldest nominee. [To June] I'm 
telling everyone that you were in Nebraska.'

And Hollywood's obsession with youth was also called out, with the tuxedo clad host saying: 'Tonight's theme is Heroes in Hollywood and we need heroes more than ever.

'I'm not saying movies are the most important thing in the world but we all know that the most important thing is youth.

Sponsored tweet? Ellen took the selfie with her Samsung phone, and the company is a big sponsor of the Oscars

We're down: Twitter crashed during the broadcast after Ellen's tweet went viral

'I'm kidding, the most important thing is love, family and friendship and if people don’t have that they get into showbiz.'

Ellen then suggested that maybe she was the biggest winner of the night.

'You should think of yourself as 
winners,' she said. 'Not all of you but those who have won before. And I
 know what you're thinking. "Ellen you've been chosen as host and that's
 the highest award there is". Thank you.'

While the nominees are all successful in their field, the host pointed out the lack of education among them: Between all of the nominees here you've made 1,400 films and attended six years of college.'

Working out the logistics: Everyone scrambled to try to figure out how best to put the picture together as a fascinated audience looked on

'I've got this!' Bradley took charge and made sure he got the perfect picture at the Oscars

She then picked one nominee out of of
 the crowd: 'Amy Adams you went to college right? What no? OK. Well 
you're amazing actress and you're in not one but two nominated films 
tonight and that is so, what is the word for this, selfish.'

She
 also pleaded with the academy to stop nominating Meryl Streep, saying 
the star could no longer afford all of the gowns and make-up which are 
needed for awards season.

It's been an exceptional year for 
movies, one of the nominees is Her, and by Her I mean Meryl Streep,' 
Ellen joked. 'Meryl has been nominated for an Oscar a total of 18 times.

'It sounds good but if you do the 
math between dresses, hair and make-up, that's hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. Simply put Meryl cannot afford to be nominated again.'

Still not forgiven? Liza still did not look happy even though she clutched on to Ellen's arm for a picture

She
 compared the Oscars to the Hunger Games and brought up Jennifer 
Lawrence falling on her way to the stage last year to accept her award.

'Who are we kidding? It’s The Hunger Games. There are cameras 
everywhere, you’re starving, Jennifer Lawrence won last year…Jennifer
 I am not going to bring up what happened last year when you fell...' Ellen began.

'For 
those who don’t know when Jennifer won last year she tripped on the way 
up. And when you fell getting out of the car tonight – no one needs to know that.

'But if you win tonight I think we should bring you the Oscar, I don’t wanna risk it.'

And
 Jared Leto didn't escape the gentle teasing, with Ellen quipping: 'Win 
or lose you look beautiful.

'Cate you look beautiful and Sandy but let’s 
be honest Jared Leto is the most beautiful of all. He’s the prettiest. 
Boy is he pretty. Matthew McConaughey is also pretty but a rugged dirty pretty.'

Ellen continued: Both are nominated 
for Dallas Buyers Club. It deals with the serious issue of people who 
have sex at the Rodeos. It looks good but don't do it.'

'Good job sir!' Liza Minnelli was less than impressed when Ellen jokingly mistook her for a male impersonator

At least someone finds it funny: Liza's sister Lorna Luft broke into howls of laughter at the quip

And that was her segue into a joke about actor Bruce Dern.

'Speaking of sex at the rodeos, Bruce
 Dern is here,' Ellen said to a chorus of laughter, especially from the 
actor's daughter Laura Dern.

'A bit of background on Bruce, his 
grandfather was the governor of Utah, his granduncle was a Pulitzer 
prize winning poet and his godmother was Eleanor Roosevelt... and here 
you are among us tonight. What went wrong?'

Pizza for everyone: Ellen handed out pizza to the assembled stars before trying to get them to chip in

Keep some for me: Brad Pitt jumped up to grab some pizza from the deliveryman from Big Mamas and Papas pizzas

Jonah Hill was next in the firing line
 when the comedian brought up his memorable scene in Wolf Of Wall Street
 where his character exposes his private parts at a pool party.

She said: 'Jonah Hill is nominated for
 his amazing performance in Wolf Of Wall Street. You showed us something
 in that film which I haven't seen for a very very long time.'

She finished with a rather poignant 
joke about how the ceremony could end:'Anything can happen. Possibility 
one, 12 Years A Slave wins the Best Picture.

'Possibility number two, you're all racists.'

Digging in: Both Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts dug in to the delicious pies from the comapny

She can take some gentle teasing: Jennifer roared with laughter as Ellen poked fun at her for falling both last year and this year

Later, Ellen had the entire auditorium in fits of laughter as she ordered pizza for everyone.

Brad
 Pitt, Jared Leto and Martin Scorsese all reached for a slice, delivered
 by a pizza man from Big Mamas pizza place on Sunset Boulevard.

Ellen tried
 to get well known faces including Harvey Weinstein to chip in for the 
food, joking that there was no pressure but the show was being beamed 
live to a huge audience who would judge him for not giving money.

Hilarious: Ellen kept Julia Roberts laughing with her quips during the evening

Winning everyone over: Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother Irmelin, Jonah Hill and Martin Scorsese couldn't stop laughing at Ellen's jokes

So far the reviews of Degeneres' 
hosting have been good with Variety's TV columnist Brian Lowry saying 
her opening monologue 'screamed of a desire to dial back the show to 
safer terrain.'

This refers to last year's host, Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane's risque 
approach to the show, which included jokes about gays, Jews and a song aimed 
actresses who have gone nude in movies called 'We Saw Your Boobs'.

The Washington Post continued the praise for Ellen, stating that the comedienne 'told 
jokes that were easy on the ears, gentle on the mind and, for the most 
part, sparingly nice.'

The 
Interview With A Vampire author, Anne Rice, said: 'Well, it's over.  And
 I think Ellen did a superb job as the host for the Oscars.'One
 person who certainly wasn't enjoying the show was Donald Tump, who 
spent the evening mocking Ellen and the production: 'I should host the 
#Oscars just to shake things up - this is not good!'
