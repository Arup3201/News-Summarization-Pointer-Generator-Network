An amateur art-lover stands to earn up to £35million after unearthing the missing head that goes with a woman’s naked body in a notorious 19th century painting.

Gustave Courbet’s The Origin Of The World, displayed in one of Paris’s most prestigious museums, the Musee d’Orsay, depicts female genitalia.

Until now it has only showed the body but experts believe the missing head has been uncovered after the anonymous art buff bought it for just £1,200 at a furniture shop.

The missing head was discovered among bric-a-brac and furniture and bought for just £1,000 but is now believed to be worth £35million

Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fermier verified the painting and said 'The Origin Of The World finally has a face'

Gustave Courbet led the French Realist movement of the 19th Century

He is said to have knocked down the asking price by a sixth.

French magazine Paris Match revealed yesterday that the collector made the accidental discovery of the head while looking through bric-a-brac back in 2010. 

But the magazine says the authenticity of
the 1866 painting, showing a brunette with a wistful upwards gaze, was
confirmed in exhaustive chemical and spectographic tests.

Jean Jacque Fernier, author of a catalogue of Courbet's work, told Paris Match: 'The Origin Of The World finally has a face'.

He said the work is one of the 'most daring in the history of painting'.

The Origin Of The World is regarded as a masterpiece by some, vulgar or even pornographic by others.

It has long been thought Courbet wished to preserve, to that extent at least, the modesty of his subject and Irish lover Joanna Hiffernan.

The discovery is now the talk of the art 
world and prompted the French TV channel TF1 to declare yesterday: 'At 
last Courbet’s painting has a face.'

Jean-Jacques Fernier, author of the 
recognised Courbet catalogue and one of the world’s leading experts on 
the painter, told Paris Match the tests were conclusive. He described it as a 'highly important' find.

Authenticity was scientifically 
established using state-of-the-art techniques that matched the two parts
of the painting, its canvas and the original wooden frame.

Mr Fernier also compared the length of brushstrokes and studied a sketch of the complete work.

The painting depicts female genitalia and was deemed so scandalous that it was not displayed until 1988

The art buff who found the painting is said to want to re-attach head to body a century and a half after the woman was painted.

Courbet, from an affluent farming family in eastern France, influenced many other artists, from Claude Monet to Paul Cezanne, but scandalised Paris with some of his work.

One painting, Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine (Summer), depicted two prostitutes under a tree. The Origin Of The World was considered so daring that it was not displayed until 1988.

He was imprisoned in 1871 for his role in inciting the revolutionary Paris Commune’s dismantling of a prominent column that was the centerpiece of the Place Vendome, but continued to paint during his detention.

He died six years later in Switzerland, aged 58, from liver disease associated with heavy drinking.

Gustave Courbet is heralded as artist who led the 19th century Realist movement and influenced greats such as Claude Monet. 

His work is displayed at some of the most prestigious galleries in the world, including the Musee d'Orsay, in Paris and Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Born to a wealthy farming family in 1819, Courbet learned to draw by using his sister's as subjects before moving to Paris in 1839.

There he developed his own style by observing the reality around him.

After winning national plaudits for his work such as After Dinner at Omans and Stone-Breakers, he gained notoriety for his detailed depictions of female genitalia in The Origin of the World. 

It was deemed so scandalous that it was not publically displayed until 1988. 

Scandal also followed other paintings such as Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine, which showed two prostitutes, and Sleep, which depicts two nude women in bed.  

He was an established artists in France but in 1871 he was jailed for his part in inciting the Paris Commune's dismantling of the Vendome Column. 

He spent six months in prison and was fined 500 francs. Courbet died in 1877, aged 58, in Switzerland.
