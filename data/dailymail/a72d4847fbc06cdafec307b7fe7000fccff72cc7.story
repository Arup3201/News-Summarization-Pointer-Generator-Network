Stuart Broad was one of two notable absentees from practice at The Oval before the fifth Investec Test between England and India.

It was thought Broad, perhaps wearing a protective mask of some description on the nose which was broken by a Varun Aaron bouncer in England's win at Old Trafford last week, would be present and correct at nets.

Instead, like India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni when India held their voluntary practice a few hours earlier, Broad was the only member of his team missing on Wednesday afternoon.

Dhoni did not attend at all - and although there were variant rumours of trips to a shooting range or the zoo, the official explanation from India was simply that their captain was resting.

Broad was at the ground but took no part in training.

His inaction, according to England, was 'planned' and will not impact on his availability when the hosts set out on Friday to defend a 2-1 lead in the last match of the series.

It was reported after the victory in Manchester, where the fast bowler was man of the match, that - despite stitches in his nose - he was expecting to be fit for purpose at The Oval.

Rest: There were rumours Dhoni had gone to the zoo but the official reason for him missing training was rest
