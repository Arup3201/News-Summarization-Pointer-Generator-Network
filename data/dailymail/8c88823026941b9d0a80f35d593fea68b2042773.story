Roy Keane has hit out at Manchester United's famous 'class of '92' by saying their importance to the club's dominance of English football has been overstated.

United's legendary youth side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 contained the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Phil Neville; all became vital to later success at Old Trafford.

The group of players took their story to the silver screen, releasing a film last year on their rise to stardom. But Keane, in his new autobiographyThe Second Half, airs his distaste for the 'brand' of the group.

He also uncovered a different side to Scholes, who has always been revered for his squeaky-clean image off the field.

'Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image,' Keane said. 'Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat.'

With almost 4,000 senior matches for United and close to 100 major trophies between them, Beckham and Co clearly delivered on their promise as the most talented set of Red Devils players since the Busby Babes in the 1950s, but Keane believes the Class of '92 'brand' has slightly overtaken the team's own success in that period.

Keane adds: 'The Class of ’92 – all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated.

'The Class of ’92 seems to have grown its own legs. It has become a brand. It’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it.

However, the Corkman clearly still felt happy to be part of a team that included the most successful United youth graduates to date, 'But we all had the same aims. We all had the same hunger.' 

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

Keane and the Class of '92 became the most successful side in the club's rich history as Ferguson's side completed the Treble in 1999, becoming the first English club to achieve such a feat.

The Red Devils went undefeated for 33 games in all competitions before producing the most dramatic of Champions League comebacks against Bayern Munich - a final which Keane was forced to miss through suspension.

Speaking about the talented generation, Ferguson said: 'I have been fortunate to work with many exceptional young players, but the Class of 92 was unique. For so many of them to stay together and succeed at the highest level is a great tribute to their talent and this club’s belief in the power of youth.

'I am convinced that no group of players will ever make such an impact on the English game as those boys have done – and continue to do.'

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'
