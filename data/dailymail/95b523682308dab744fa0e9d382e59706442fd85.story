Criticism: Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, blasted the Tory plans to make it harder to call industrial action

Coaliiton Ministers last night descended into open warfare after Tory plans to curb public sector strikes were condemned by Liberal Democrats as a ‘brutal bid to strangle workers’ rights’.

Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, blasted the Tory plans to make it harder to call industrial action if it would affect health services, transport, fire or schools.

While under the current laws a strike can be called if it is backed by a simple majority of those balloted, under the new Tory plan the backing of 40 per cent of eligible union members would be required.

Mr Cable – who last week defied his leader Nick Clegg’s attempt to remove him as the party’s lead spokesman on the economy during the Election – condemned the move as ‘entirely ideologically-led’.

He said: ‘Setting a mandatory 40 per cent level of support for strike action seems odd when MPs do not need to reach such a high hurdle to get elected. There’s no doubt these ill-conceived Tory plans wouldf have major implications for other democratic elections, from MEPs to police commissioners.

‘Industrial relations in the UK are good and the Conservatives would do well to turn their attention to creating a fairer society.’

Mr Cable added: ‘These Conservative proposals are... a brutal attempt to strangle the basic rights of working people in this country.’

The ‘40 per cent’ rule, which will form part of the Tory Election manifesto, was raised yesterday by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who said it was ‘ridiculous’ that a planned London bus strike later this month had been voted for by only 16 per cent of people entitled to take part in the ballot.

‘I think before a strike is allowed to go ahead it must have much more support from the union members and cannot be called by politicised union leaders,’ Mr McLoughlin said.

The proposed changes were immediately condemned by Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who said they would have a ‘chilling’ effect, while TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady even invoked this year’s 800th anniversary of Magna Carta to condemn the ‘anti-democratic’ crackdown. 

She said: ‘These attacks are not worthy of the Government – they’re being launched in the year we celebrate Magna Carta, for goodness sake.’

With the General Election now just four months away, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrat members of the Coalition are keen to ‘differentiate’ their political differences to appeal to their core voter base. 

The row between Mr Cable and Mr Clegg came after the Deputy Prime Minister announced on Wednesday that Mr Cable will lead on business policy during the campaign – a blow to Mr Cable who led on the economy at the 2010 Election.

Mr Clegg said that Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (L) would replace Mr Cable (R) as the lead economic spokesman, including in any televised debates

Mr Clegg said that Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander would replace Mr Cable as the lead economic spokesman, including in any televised debates.

However, Mr Cable insisted that he was going nowhere, and dismissed the matter as a ‘minor internal question’.

When Tory MP Philip Davies said during a Commons debate that he had been ‘removed as the economic spokesman for your party at the General Election’, Mr Cable replied: ‘Well, I actually remain as our economic spokesman but that’s a minor internal question.’

But a spokesman for Mr Alexander later said: ‘Danny has been appointed as the economics spokesman by Nick Clegg. That is the reality.’

A source close to Mr Cable then said: ‘He remains economic spokesperson but Danny is also an economic spokesperson.’ The two men are said by sources to be barely on speaking terms.
