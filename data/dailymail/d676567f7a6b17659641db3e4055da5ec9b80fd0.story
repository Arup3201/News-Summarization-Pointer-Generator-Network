Over-the-counter divorces will make ending a marriage as easy as 'disposing of a carrier bag', a former government minister has warned.

Ann Widdecombe said plans under consideration by the most senior family law judge in England and Wales, Sir James Munby will make obtaining a divorce even easier than it is at present.

This comes as the Office of National Statistics has revealed that the number of couples divorcing has increased by 0.5 percent between 2011 and 2012.

Ann Widdicombe, left, believes plans under consideration by Sir James Munby, right would be 'making an nonsense of marriage' and 'should not be like buying sweets over the counter, or discarding an old carrier bag'

Couples have to be married for at least a year before they can apply for a divorce in England and Wales.

A so-called 'quickie divorce' can be granted in England and Wales within six months in the case of adultery or unreasonable behaviour.

However, if there are complicated financial issues or a dispute over child care arrangements, the process can take several years.

In all cases, one party has to apply to court for a decree nisi citing one of five grounds for the divorce.

Once the decree nisi is granted under one of the five grounds, a decree absolute, ending the marriage officially can be issued after six weeks.

Ms Widdecombe told The Times: 'Divorce is already too easy — it makes a
 nonsense of marriage. I am not saying, go back to the old days when 
divorce involved tricks and stratagems, but at least it should be 
something people have to think about and take a great deal of trouble 
over.

'It should not be like buying sweets over the counter, or discarding an old carrier bag.'

The number of divorces has fallen from a high of 153,000 in 2003, although this could be due to a reduction in the number of people getting married.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, 450,000 people a year were getting married compared with 250,000 in 2012.

In England and Wales, married couples can apply for a divorce if they have been married for at least twelve months and accept that the relationship has permanently broken down.

The marriage has to be legally recognised in the UK and the couple must have a permanent home in England and Wales.

At present, a divorce petition has to be filed with the court showing the reason for the marriage to end.

If
 the spouse agrees to the petition, the court will grant a decree nisi, 
showing there is no reason why a divorce cannot be granted.

Six weeks later, the marriage can be ended with the granting of a decree absolute.

According 
to the Office of National Statistics, 13 divorces an hour were granted 
in 2012 with almost half of these happening within the first decade of 
marriage.

Women were granted 65 per cent of all divorces and only one in seven was due to adultery.

Almost
 half of those divorcing had at least one child aged under 16 living 
with the family while the most likely time for a split is between the 
fourth and eighth wedding anniversary.

According to current figures, 42 per cent of all marriages will end in divorce.

From 2015, the ONS will also release figures on the first same-sex divorces.

More than 40 per cent of all marriages will end in divorce with couples between four and eight years married at the greatest risk

However, Sir James wants to streamline the process, removing uncontested divorces from the court system.

He said: ‘There are countries where the system is that a divorce 
which is by consent and where there are no children is treated as an 
administrative matter dealt with by what, using our terminology, one 
might describe as the registrar of births, deaths, marriages and 
divorces. It seems to work.’

He said he ‘would not contemplate it
 in cases other than cases where there is consent and cases where there 
are no children of the family’.

Sir James added: ‘All one is doing is actually bringing a
 bit of intellectual honesty to the situation and getting rid of an 
unnecessary process which simply makes life more complicated.’

Any changes to divorce law would need 
parliamentary  legislation to be drawn up and pushed through by the 
Justice Secretary. Ministers have  indicated that present Justice 
Secretary Chris Grayling will not consider divorce reform before the 
election.

Andrew Leah, partner at Birchall Blackburn Law said: 'Sir James has stirred up debate in the media by advocating the introduction of new “no-fault” divorces which wouldn’t be dealt with by the courts, but rather by Registrars as an administrative exercise similar to the registration of births,  marriages and deaths.

'Unusually perhaps for a member of the legal profession, I would cautiously welcome Sir James’ suggested reforms for people who want to divorce by mutual consent.  By taking uncontested divorces out of the court system, it could be a faster and cheaper way to bring marriages to an end and may avoid some of the acrimony that sometimes results from court proceedings.

'Sir James’ suggestions do not appear to propose changes to the current rules which provide for compulsory mediation in divorces involving financial or child related issues.   In those circumstances, for people without the benefit of the right legal advice, there is a danger that the dominant partner in the marriage could try to manipulate the mediation process to their own advantage.'

The Office of National Statistics will release the first figures on same-sex divorces from 2015
