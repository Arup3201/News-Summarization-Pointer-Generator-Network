Kevin Magnussen has spurned Felipe Massa's overtures to clear the air between them.

Massa has made no secret of the fact he felt Magnussen was totally in the wrong for their first-corner shunt in last Sunday's German Grand Prix that resulted in him being flipped upside down in his Williams.

The Brazilian accused the McLaren rookie of being 'too aggressive' and taking the wrong line, whilst chastising young drivers in general for causing too many accidents.

That is despite the fact it was Massa who had to answer to the stewards for 'causing a collision', with the 33-year-old cleared.

Not even a few days of reflection, though, altered Massa's view as he reiterated his remarks of a few days ago on Thursday ahead of this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix.

Massa did at least state he would be more than happy to chat over the situation with Magnussen, although the 21-year-old Dane is far from keen.

Asked whether it was worth talking to Massa, Magnussen replied: 'No, it's done. We are here in Hungary and not in Germany any more.

'It happened and it's good no-one got hurt, especially him because he was on his roof and it looked bad. The most important thing is he's all right.

'Whoever was at fault is not really something I get in to. It's up to the stewards to judge and he was reported to the stewards, I wasn't.

'From their view I didn't do anything wrong.'

Massa claimed Magnussen should have backed out of his move down the inside into turn one, but the latter insists he did not do anything wrong, and if given the same opportunity would take it.

'What I did was get a great launch, got on the inside of Valtteri Bottas (Massa's team-mate), but not quite enough to have him in the corner,' added Magnussen.

'Obviously I had to back out of that and then it (the accident) happened. I'm not sure I would have done anything different.

'You learn from these things and if it's your fault or not it's still experience and something you remember.'
