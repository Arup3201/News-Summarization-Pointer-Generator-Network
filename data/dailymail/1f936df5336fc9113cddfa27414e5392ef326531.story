An arrest has been made in the mysterious case of a New Hampshire 15-year-old girl who went missing nine months ago and reappared home last week.

Nathaniel Kibby, 34, was arrested at his home in Gorham Monday afternoon and charged with the felony kidnapping of Conway teen Abigail Hernandez.

The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office said in a press release that Kibby confined Hernandez on October 9, 2013 'with purpose to commit an offense against her.'

Collared: Nathaniel E Kibby, 34, was arrested Monday in connection to the nine-month disappearance of New Hampshire teen Abigail Hernandez, who reappeared alive in her hometown last week

'Hernandez provided police with details of her kidnapping sufficient to warrant (the) arrest,' investigators added.

Kibby was allegedly arrested without incident and is set to be arraigned in Tuesday at Conway District Court.

Neighbor Donald Stgermain, 76, was at home at the time Kibby was arrested and described the scene to MailOnline.

Mr Stgermain said he was making food around noon when law enforcement showed up outside his neighbor's house, 'dressed in battle gear with rifles'.

He says about an hour later FBI agents showed up at his house, asking if he knew Kibby or had ever seen a young girl near the house. Mr Stgermain said he never had, and never noticed anything strange happening at Kibby's house.

Kibby has been living at the residence on Brookside Drive for about five years, Mr Stgermain said.

When he moved in he had a girlfriend, but Mr Stgermain says they appeared to have broken up and Kibby has since lived alone.

Mr Stgermain's wife has seen Kibby walking a Doberman around the neighborhood on a few occasions.

Abigail made headlines last October 9 -
 just days before her 15th birthday -  when she unexpectedly disappeared
 after last seen by her boyfriend walking home from school.

Back home: Abigail Hernandez made headlines last October when she disappeared from her hometown of North Conway, New Hampshire while walking home from school. She reappeared home last week

The
 only contact she had with any friends or family was a letter believed 
to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her divorced parents, Zenya and 
Ruben Hernandez, in the weeks after her disappearance.

Then last Sunday, she suddenly reappeared.

Kibby's arrest came just hours after Hernandez's mother gave an interview, to speak out against rumors surrounding her daughter's disappearance.

In an interview with the Today show, mother Zenya Hernandez shut down speculation that her daughter ran away because she was pregnant.

'The majority of people somehow believe that she was pregnant. She was not. She did not run away. I firmly believe that,' Mrs Hernandez said, adding that she does not believe her daughter knew her alleged abductor.

'She did not run away': Zenya Hernandez spoke with the Today show on Monday to dispell rumors her daughter ran away nine months ago because she was pregnant. Mrs Hernandez says she believes her daughter was abducted

Police have since released a sketch of the man believed to have abducted Abigail, according to the teen's descriptions. However, law enforcement have not released further details of their investigation since her reappearance.

‘Our biggest challenge is, we’re 
dealing with incomplete information,’ Kieran Ramsey, assistant special 
agent in charge of the Boston Division of the FBI told The Boston Globe. ‘The
 victim in this case is a 15-year-old girl. It’s not as cut and dried as
 people think that somebody can exactly recount what happened, when, and
 where.’

Mrs Hernandez also described the moment her daughter returned home last week, wearing the same clothes as the day she went missing in October 2013.

'We just stood and looked at each other and then we hugged and I just said, "Thank god you're home, thank god you're home."'

While it was a happy homecoming, Mrs Hernandez was worried by the change in her daughter who had lost a lot of weight and was very pale.

'She had a look in her eyes that I've never ever seen before and that's haunting me,' Mrs Hernandez said.

In her interview, Mrs Hernandez vowed to bring her daughter's abductor to justice.

'I feel like they just took and ripped something out of our souls and just as I swore that I'll find her - I'll find the person. I'll find out what happened,' Mrs Hernandez said. 

Clues: This week police released video of Abby on the day she 
disappeared, left, and a sketch of a man they believe drove her away in a
 blue pick-up after interviewing Abby for three hours

On Saturday, authorities released a 
sketch of a man, provided to them by Abby, who they believe drove her 
away in a blue pick-up back in October.

On Friday, the District Attorney's office
 revealed that police had received 20 tips from members of the public, 
following the release of the sketch.

Despite conducting a three-hour 
interview with the teen, it is unclear whether they know where she was 
or if she was taken by force.

They
 have also appealed for witnesses who may have seen Abby return after 
she was apparently dropped off on the same road that she was possibly 
abducted from all those months ago.

Sources
 close to the investigation said the teenager has so far not been able 
to tell officers many facts about her disappearance.

But
 they are convinced a crime has been committed - as they believe there 
is no way the 15-year-old could have stayed hidden for nine months 
without some kind of adult involvement.

Abigail's reappearance has baffled her North Conway community, including her old boyfriend Jimmy Campbell, 15, and his family who spent a lot of time with the teen before she went missing.

So far, they have had little contact with Abigail and her mother, and have received no answers in relation to her nine month absence.

'I have instant messaged Abby’s mother 
Zenya, but we have not had any contact. All I want is the truth, I don’t
 care what happened, but I want to know who the sons of b*****s were who
 had her for nine months,' Jimmy's father James Campbell told MailOnline.

Because Abby spent so much time with 
Jimmy at the Campbell’s house, the family were questioned by FBI agents 
as a matter of course when she first disappeared.

Mr Campbell says his family are overjoyed 
Abby is home, but he feels the community, who invested so much time and 
effort into the search, deserve to know what happened.

'I
 understand the police want to keep the investigation hush hush to an 
extent, but they wanted our help when they were looking for her, so how 
about giving us some answers now?', he said.

Abigail has not spoken publicly about her alleged abduction, but has released a statement thanking those in her community that aided in the search.

'My gratitude is beyond words. It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release,' she said.

However, many locals in North Conway feel the same as James Campbell and are still incredibly frustrated by the lack of answers.

A number of people posted their views on the Facebook page of The Conway Daily Sun.

One,
 Jaime McKinnon, wrote: 'Okay... So I hate to be a huge jerk here.. but 
seriously. It's like pulling teeth to get any darn info. The entire area
 has gone above and beyond to support and help with the search for her. 
Now she's back and we can't get any darn answers.'

Mystery: James Campbell, who says he was close to Abby and her family, has not talked to Abby's mother since she returned. He, like the rest of the town, are left searching for answers over where she has been

Reunion: Ms Smith said she spoke to Zenya this week who told her: 'It's over. The nightmare's over.' Ms Smith added that: 'They could just sit in a room staring at each other and they'd be happy. They are just enjoying being around each other'
