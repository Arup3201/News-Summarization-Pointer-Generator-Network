Celtic are in the hunt for Senegal international Kara Mbodj, who plays for Alex McLeish’s Belgian side Racing Genk.

The Parkhead side will be looking for reinforcements in the January transfer window after a stuttering start to Ronny Deila’s first season in charge.

And 25-year-old Mbodj, who can play as a defender or a holding midfielder, is one of the names being targeted.

But Celtic are expected to face competition for his signature from south of the border, with Barclays Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and West Ham United also credited with an interest in the 25-year-old.

Deila knows Mbodj well after he played for Norwegian side Tromso for two years, with the Celtic boss encountering him on numerous occasions when he was in charge of Stromsdgodset.

Mbodj said: ‘I can confirm that British clubs are showing interest in me.

‘But I don’t want this to distract from my focus which is to get Genk as high up the league as possible.

‘In January we will talk to these clubs and I will make a decision on my future then.’

Mbodj has helped transform McLeish’s side from relegation contenders to European place hopefuls in the Belgian Pro League - and it’s that form that will see Celtic look closely at the talented African.

Meanwhile, midfielder Stefan Johansen has apologised to Celtic fans for the 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice and says the Scottish champions will make Ross County pay in their next league match.

The 25-year-old has scored once in his 12 appearances for the Senegalese senior side

With Deila’s men hosting Jim McIntyre’s struggling Highlanders at Parkhead on Saturday, Norwegian international Johansen said: ‘Good teams bounce back right away so we will just focus on training well and focus on that game - because we want to get back on the winning run.

‘Ross County always try to defend and then counter attack, but if we do our own things well enough, then we should beat them and that’s what we have to focus on.

‘The fans were fantastic at Tannadice and it was a joy to play in front of them so I’d like to say sorry we couldn’t win.’
