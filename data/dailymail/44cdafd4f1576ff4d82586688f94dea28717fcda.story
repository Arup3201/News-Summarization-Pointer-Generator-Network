Hull are close to completing an Â£8million move for Norwich midfielder Robert Snodgrass.

The Canaries are struggling to keep hold of the Scotland international following their relegation from the Barclays Premier League.

Star man: Robert Snodgrass was a bright spot in a disappointing season for relegated Norwich

Tigers boss Steve Bruce is interested in taking the 26-year-old and talks between both clubs are understood to be at an advanced stage.

And last season's FA Cup finalists are hopeful of completing a move for Snodgrass before the start of next week.

Goalscoring midfielder: Robert Snodgrass scored seven goals for Norwich last season

Snodgrass' performances were a rare bright spot for Norwich last season, as he scored seven goals for the club.
