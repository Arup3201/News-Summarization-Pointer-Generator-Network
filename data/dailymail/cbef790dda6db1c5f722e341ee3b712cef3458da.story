Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos hit back at the Spanish media for their recent criticism of the side.

The German World Cup winner is unhappy at the way the press have turned so suddenly after Real's stuttering 2015.

A 2-1 defeat in El Clasico last weekend left Real Madrid four points behind league leaders Barcelona with 10 games remaining.

Carlo Ancelotti's side also came close to a Champions League exit at the hands of Schalke when they suffered a 4-3 second-leg defeat at the Santiago Bernabeu.

That is despite an incredible 22-game winning streak before Christmas that took them to the top of the Spanish league and through the Champions League group stages with a 100 per cent record.Â 

Kroos told Sport1: 'Those who know me a bit better know I'm not like a flag that moves with the wind, as they sometimes do in the Spanish media.

'When you win a game, everything is good, and when you lose, everything is negative.'
