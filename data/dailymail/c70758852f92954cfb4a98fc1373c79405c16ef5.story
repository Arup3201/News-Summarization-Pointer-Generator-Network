Unlucky in love: Hilary Devey divorced her husband Philip Childs in a 70-second hearing

They are renowned for their financial acumen, but the stars of BBC 2 series Dragons’ Den seem cursed in love – with self-made millionaire Hilary Devey the latest to divorce.

The 55-year-old haulage tycoon, known for her flamboyant style, ended her two-year marriage to her third husband, property developer Philip Childs, at a 70-second hearing at the High Court last week.

Her divorce – on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour on both sides – follows the marital splits of fellow Dragons’ Den entrepreneurs Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones.

Mr Bannatyne, who amassed an £85 million fortune from his health clubs, took to Twitter last month to say he had to make staff redundant because of the cost of his divorce from his second wife Joanne McCue. 

And telecoms millionaire Mr Jones, who according to last year’s Sunday Times Rich List is worth £367 million, separated from his wife in the early Nineties after his business crashed in the recession.

Last year Ms Devey revealed that she was living alone with her son from a former marriage. Her home – a wing of oppulent Rangemore Hall on the outskirts of Burton-on-Trent, which includes a swimming pool and gym – is now on the market for £1,950,000.

Ms Devey has vowed she will never remarry and said her latest divorce was ‘probably one of the unhappiest periods of my life’.

She said: ‘It’s bloody hard knowing that a third relationship has gone down the pan. I feel hurt, angry and just a little bit bewildered because I can’t seem to get it right with men.’

Bolton-born Ms Devey, who was just seven
when she started helping out in her father’s corner shop, launched her 
freight distribution company Pall-Ex in 1996, made her first million 
within three years and is now worth an estimated £100 million.

She will leave Dragons’ Den this year to present her own show, The Interim, on Channel 4. 

Shortly after her marriage to  Mr Childs she had declared she was happier than she had ever been despite the fact he did not always like her fashion choices.

At the time she said: ‘He tells me  I spend too much on clothes .  .  . if only he knew the actual amount.’

A spokesman for Ms Devey said last night that she would not be  commenting and was out of the country. Meanwhile, the decision last week of long-standing Dragon and stationery magnate Theo Paphitis to leave the show too has sparked speculation about replacements.

Names mooted so far include  Richard Reed from Innocent Drinks, Angus Thirlwell of Hotel Chocolat, and former panellist on the programme James Caan, who is a  venture capitalist.
