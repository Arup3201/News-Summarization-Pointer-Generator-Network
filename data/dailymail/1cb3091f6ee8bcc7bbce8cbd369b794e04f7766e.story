The World Cup Is Not Enough for Arsene Wenger, as he took time out from his busy schedule of punditry and scouting to take a dip in the sea at Ipanema beach before enjoying a game of beach football.

There were shades of Daniel Craig’s famous scene in Casino Royale as Wenger emerged from the water wearing a skimpy pair of sky blue trunks.

After drying himself down he took part in a game of beach football with former France internationals Christian Karembeu and Bixtente Lizarazu. 

And in a game of beach volleyball, Wenger pulled off a header similar to the one scored by Robin van Persie during Holland's 5-1 win over Spain in Salvador.

Arsenal fans will be hoping Wenger has been lining up potential signings for the club ahead of the new season, with Manchester United already strengthening by adding Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera on Thursday.

Despite allowing Real Sociedad to keep Mexican striker Carlos Vela, Wenger denied any interest in signing AC Milan and Italy striker Mario Balotelli.

Arsenal have been linked to the forward repeatedly this summer as they look to bolster their attacking options but the Wenger said the story was 'not true'.

Wenger, appearing on beIN Sport's World Cup show, was asked by Ruud Gullit if he was interest in buying the former Manchester City striker, but responded: 'No. No, that’s pure invention.

'We cannot believe absolutely everything that is on internet or is in newspapers.

'Sometimes it’s created by agents or by press who needs news. But in that case, it’s not true.'
