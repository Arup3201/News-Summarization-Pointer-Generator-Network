British holidaymakers craving guaranteed sunshine are most likely to jet off on Monday, August 12.

Temperatures rocketed to 26 degrees this week but over a quarter of British people still believe that we have the worst weather in
the world.

The disappointing weather in May and June left millions across the country fed up - with two thirds feeling miserable because of all the wind and rain throughout May and June, according to a report by Post Office Travel.

Just under a quarter even go as far as diagnosing themselves with Seasonal Affective Disorder.

The need for escapism can prove time-consuming as the average person spends over two hours a week online looking for the perfect getaway.

Paul Havenhand, Head of Travel at the Post Office 
said: 'It's understandable that people are frustrated with the 
inconsistent weather we're having. The recent announcement that this 
sunshine won't last has unsurprisingly set the nation's mood for a mass 
holiday exodus.'

According to the study, it also appears that people in certain cities hanker for a holiday more than others.

Despite being on the coast, the people of Southampton, feel the most downbeat about the downpours earlier this summer followed by those from Manchester, Leicester and Plymouth.

Yet while one in seven will book a last-minute holiday, a third of people say they will simply hide behind closed doors to avoid any future bad weather.
