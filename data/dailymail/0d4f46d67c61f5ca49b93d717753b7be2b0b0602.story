A young deli worker who became pregnant with her third child was allegedly told she would lose her job unless she got an abortion.

Catherine Rizzo, 25, of Long Island, New York, who was earning $400 to $500 per week, is suing Cooky’s Deli owner Martin Marsilio, 69.

She had to terminate her pregnancy because she needed her job to look after her other two children, a lawsuit in Brooklyn Federal Court claims.

'Abortion threat': Catherine Rizzo, 25, of Long Island, New York, who was earning $400 to $500 per week, is suing Cooky's Deli owner Martin Marsilio, 69

‘The owner’s daughter pulled me in the office and basically told me if I didn’t have an abortion, I wasn’t going to have a job,’ she told the New York Post.

Ms Rizzo claimed she stayed there because she needed her job and said it was 'hard to deal' with the abortion she was allegedly forced to have.

But Mr Marsillio said the allegation is a ‘total lie’, she was fired for being regularly late for work and never complained about harassment.

‘Many female employees here have gotten pregnant, had their children, took time off and came back to work,’ he told the New York Post.

Ms Rizzo claims the ‘abortion’ comments from the owner’s daughter - who was her supervisor - were made last year in May.

She also alleges that she was often cursed at by a co-worker, pushed and told she was a ‘lowlife and bad mother’, reported the New York Post.

Then last August she was allegedly abruptly fired despite going through the abortion and evicted with her children from their apartment.

She found new employment and a new home - but then Cooky’s employees allegedly turned up to take photos of her in her workplace.

Mr Marsilio told the New York Post this was because he wanted to prove to unemployment officials that she was working without record of payment.
