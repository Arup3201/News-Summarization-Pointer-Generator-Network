Wanted: Lee Willis, 30, was detained by Greater Manchester Police on New Year's Day after going on the run last year

One of Britain's most-wanted criminals, who was thought to be hiding in Spain, has been arrested in Bolton.

Lee Willis, 30, was detained by Greater Manchester Police on New Year's Day, the force said today.

He had admitted possessing cocaine and cannabis in March last year but went on the run before he was due to be sentenced in June. Willis also stands accused of dealing the class A drug.

Willis, from Ashton-under-Lyne, was highlighted on a list issued by the charity Crimestoppers, the UK's National Crime Agency and Spanish police in Madrid last year as one of 13 of Britain's most-wanted fugitives.

The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who were believed to have fled to Spain.

Willis is due to appear in court later this month, Greater Manchester Police said.

The fugitives are wanted for crimes including, attempted murder, sexual offences against children and class A drug dealing.

The 'unlucky 13,' as they have been dubbed by the National Crime Agency, Crimestoppers, and Spanish police, are thought to view Spain as a 'safe haven'.

The full 13 have been named by authorities and include a man who has been convicted of a heroin distribution offence and is still awaiting sentencing.

Police say Stephen Blundell, from Liverpool, was 'the principle organiser of his own heroin supply chain', often arranging for the drug to be shipped from Liverpool to Devon.

Also from Liverpool is David Hewson, who has been found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine and despite his absence was sentenced to 11 years in prison. He remains on the run.

Michael McCartney, 78, from Hertfordshire, was found guilty of nine counts of indecent assault and another of child sex abuse, namely on three boys over a number of a years.

Collaboration between UK and Spanish authorities is said to be key in tracing the criminals and both are appealing for diligence in the public to report sightings.

Lord Ashcroft, founder of Crimestoppers, said: 'The fact we are able to once again launch Operation Captura is an indication of how successful the last seven years have been since its inception.

'However despite our success so far, there are still a number of dangerous criminals who see Spain as a safe haven to hide from their past, but with the support of the Spanish and UK public, we can hunt them out and bring them to justice.'
