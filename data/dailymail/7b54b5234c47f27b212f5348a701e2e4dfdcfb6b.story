The judge who requested Jerry Sandusky be freed on $100,000 unsecured bail, undertook volunteer work for the retired American football coach’s charity, according to reports.

District Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who previously volunteered for The Second Mile charity, ruled that the former Pennsylvania State University defensive coordinator be freed without posting any bail money unless he doesn't arrive for court.

Her decision overruled a bid by prosecutors, who requested a $500,000 bail be set for the 67-year-old and for him to be fitted with a leg monitor, after being charged with 21 felony counts for alleged sexual abuse.

A Grand Jury indictment alleges Sandusky sexually abused eight boys, some as young as seven, over a 15-year period. Sandusky denies the charges.

Reports that the judge worked for the
 charity came as it was also revealed Sandusky was still being paid out 
large monthly pension cheques from Pennsylvania State University from 
his retirement deal, according to The Patriot-News.

Sandusky founded non-profit 
organisation The  Second Mile in the late 1970s to help disadvantaged 
children (and allegedly picked his victims from it) and it is listed as one of the various charities Judge Dutchcot
 has volunteered for throughout her career.

The information was spotted on 
website centrelaw.com, which is the site for Goodall and Yurchak’s law 
firm that Dutchcot is counsel to.

Sandusky, who retired from his 
position as assistant coach in 1999, continued to have access to the 
university’s facilities and maintained his coach ‘emeritus’ status, 
according to Fox News.

He originally received a $148,271 cheque from the State Employees’ Retirement System.

Since 1999, Sandusky has also 
apparently continued to receive the remainder of his pension paid out in
 monthly sums that equate to $58,898 per year.

The university’s former Vice 
President Gary Schultz, who has been charged with perjury and failing to
 report the alleged child abuse, has also been receiving monthly pension
 payments, according to The Patriot-News.

Mr Schultz retired from Penn State in
 2009 and was paid a lump sum of $421,847 followed by monthly payments 
of $27,558 – equating to almost $331,000 annually.

Despite retiring, Schultz returned to Penn State in September on a temporary basis.

The university’s former athletic 
director, Tim Curley, has also been charged with perjury and failing to 
report the alleged abuse, and has not received state pension payments.

Both the athletic director and Shultz
 left their positions at the university when they were indicted but 
plead not guilty to the charges.

Sandusky’s attorney Joe Amendola also said his client rejects all the allegations set forth in a 23-page indictment.

Autobiography: In Touched, Sandusky details his workings with children he met through Second Mile

Meanwhile, over the weekend 
Sandusky’s former daughter-in-law obtained a legal order barring the 
ex-Penn State coach from seeing three of his grandchildren.

Jill Jones was once married to Matt 
Sandusky, 33, who is one of six now adult children that the former coach
 and his wife Dorothy adopted through The Second Mile charity.

Ms Jones went to court to stop the 
accused paedophile from having access to their two daughters, aged nine 
and seven, and one son, five, according to documents.

Despite Sandusky’s wife Dorothy 
trying to persuade Ms Jones that the children would be safe around her 
husband, Ms Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding 
the children from sleeping over at their grandparents’ home and banning 
Sandusky from seeing them unsupervised.

There is no record however, of Ms Jones ever accusing her ex-father-in-law of abusing her children.

Her former husband Matt was adopted 
by the Sandusky’s in 1995 after having a trouble childhood during which 
he had burnt down a barn.

It has been reported that Matt 
attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with the 
couple, after being placed by Children and Youth Services at the 
Sandusky family’s request.

The probation officer, Terry Trude, 
became concerned about Matt's well-being and mental health and together 
with his biological mother Debra Long, wrote a letter to Centre County 
Judge David Grine asking for his living situation to be reviewed, the 
Patriot-News reported.

Minnesota Republican Michele Bachman yesterday said that she would ‘beat Jerry Sandusky to a pulp’ if he had abused any of her children.

The mother-of-five biological children, who has also raised 23 foster children over the years, said on NBC’s  Meet the Press segment that ‘justice will be done’ now that the Sandusky case has received national coverage.

The presidential candidate said: ‘This is so horrific on the level of a parent. I think about my children – if that was my child – and I think my automatic reaction would be – even though I’m a small woman – I’d want to go find that guy and beat him to a pulp.

‘I think that’s what any parent would want to do when they think that about their child’, Fox news reported.

However contemporary court records 
include a letter written by Matt in which he implores the judge to allow
 him to stay with the family.

'I would like to be placed back with 
the Sanduskys. I feel that they have supported me even when I have 
messed up. They are a loving caring group of people. I love both my 
biological family and the Sandusky family,' he wrote at the time.

Matt is not one of the eight victims 
in the Grand Jury indictment, but he did testify before the 
investigative panel at the attorney general’s office in the Strawberry 
Square complex, Harrisburg,  the Patriot-News reported.

Two of Matt’s adopted siblings followed their father into the world of football: Edward Joel, 41, a former Nittany Lions player, and now a football coach at West Chester University and Jon, who is Director of Player Personnel for the Cleveland Browns.

Last week, Jon went on a leave of absence from the NFL club as the scandal involving his father exploded into the public domain. He and his wife, Kia, have an infant son.

Over the years the Sanduskys also became the parents to Ray, now 46, a photographer and woodturner living in Brentwood, Tennesee, Kara, 38, a Penn State graduate, and Jeff, 35, a former Marine.

In Sandusky's 2000 memoir titled 'Touched', Kara, named Sandusky Werner, wrote in the introduction: 'We were always proud of the things he did for kids.'

On his website, Ray writes: 'I have always been creative and constructive. I can recall painting meaningful images as a child in kindergarten, throwing clay vessels on a wheel in junior high school and performing all manner of assembly and repairs around the house.'

Last week saw people who believed they knew Sandusky come forward to express their shock at the allegations.

'A lot of people look at him as a monster now,' Kip Richeal, who co-authored Touched, told ESPN. 'I would've never, ever thought something like this about him. And how long did it go on? It never happened with me. When I met him, though, I was 18. I wasn't a little boy.

'If this is all true, and it looks like it's really stacking up, something took over his personality. Something changed, and it's not the Jerry I know.'

Meanwhile ex-NFL player Jon Ritchie, who knew Sandusky since he was a 14-year-old, said on ESPN: 'I thought he was the most compassionate, altruistic, selfless man on the face of the planet.

'There were always kids around, Second Mile kids (the charity Sandusky set up and allegedly picked his victims from).

'And these tragedies that are coming out now have brought sports, have brought everyone, to the darkest place. I can’t fathom sports right now. I don’t even care about sports right now. Because this picture of what I thought was good has exploded.'
