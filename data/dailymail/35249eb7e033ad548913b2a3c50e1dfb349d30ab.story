Tim Cahill's super-strike has been hailed for its brilliant technique that left fans around the world purring and showed that there is nothing better than a sweetly struck volley.

But did it rank among the best volleyed efforts of all-time? Sportsmail looks back on the best volleyed goals that rival Cahill's in a list of football's greatest volleys.

Crash, bang, wallop: Cahill showed there's nothing better than a sweetly struck volleyed goal

Brazil-liant: But where does Cahill's goal rank among the all-time greatest volleyed strikes?

1 Marco van Basten: Holland v Russia, June 1988 (European Championship final)

The enormity of the occasion and the tightness of the angle mean Van Basten's iconic effort might never be beaten. Waiting for the ball to drop over his shoulder, where most would have panicked the Dutchman produced a moment of magic, hooking the ball back across the 'keeper and into the net.

Simply the best: Van Basten's goal had everything - an outrageous piece of skill on a huge occasion

2 Zinedine Zidane: Real Madrid v Bayer Leverkusen, May 2002 (Champions League final)

Again, the sense of occasion helps, and in club football they don't come any bigger than the Champions League final - but this was genius from Zizou. With a pretty average high ball dropping in the penalty area the Frenchman's thinking was - as usual - one step ahead of the rest. Swinging his left boot at a right-angle he made an almost impossible shot look easy.

Classic: Zidane's goal decided the Champions League final at Hampden Park in Glasgow, 2002

3 Tony Yeboah: Leeds v Liverpool, August 1995 (Premier League)

Everyone knows that any goal that goes in off the crossbar looks twice as good as one that doesn't - and Yeboah's stunning shot was already looking good before it hit the woodwork. Despite leaning back just to control the strike the Ghanian controlled his effort to send it flying past a despairing David James.

Hero: Yeboah was a Leeds icon - not least for his brilliant goal against Liverpool at Elland Road

4 Paolo Di Canio: West Ham v Wimbledon, March 2000 (Premier League)

A brilliant and memorable effort from the mad Italian's playing days as he pulled off the perfect scissor-kick to score for West Ham. Made even better by Di Canio's fairly casual celebration despite the ludicrous goal he has just scored - maybe he wanted to see a replay?

Brilliant: Di Canio's stunning scissor kick set up West Ham for a 2-1 win over Wimbledon at Upton Park

5 Ronnie Whelan: Republic of Ireland v Russia, June 1988 (European Championship group stage)

Whelan's goal is almost forgotten about at times, coming in the same tournament as Van Basten's best efforts, but it shouldn't be. The former Liverpool captain's left-footed volley flew into the top corner from a long throw-in in a move that most wouldn't have even bothered attempting from the edge of the area. Brilliant.

Delight: Whelan celebrates his wondergoal that left his Irish team-mates ecstatic

6 Robin van Persie: Charlton v Arsenal, 2006 (Premier League)

Van Persie loves a spectacular goal and this was no different - running onto the ball on the edge of the penalty area he somehow maneuvered his body to slam home this volley.

Never forgotten: Van Persie celebrates his volleyed effort for former club Arsenal against Charlton

7 Jeremy Goss: Norwich City v Bayern Munich, October 1993 (UEFA Cup)

One of the biggest nights in Norwich City's history and they came to call on a man who had a habit of scoring big goals - Jeremy Goss reacted fastest to a loose ball on the edge of the area and cannoned his shot past the 'keeper.

Local hero: Goss scored for Norwich in Bayern Munich's first home loss to an English club

8 Nayim: Real Zaragoza v Arsenal, May 1995 (European Cup Winners Cup final)

'Nayim - from the half-way line' was a taunt that followed Arsenal for years after this dramatic effort. A bit of a 'hit and hope' effort but the dramatic nature of the goal - coming in the closing minutes of extra-time to win a European final - and the fact that it came from a full 45 yards out, has to rank it among the best.

Helpless: Nayim's brilliant last-minute effort gave David Seaman no chance in the Arsenal goal

9 Tim Cahill: Australia v Holland, 2014 (World Cup group stage)

It takes something special to pull out a move like this on the biggest stage of them all - particularly for the lowest ranked team in the tournament. Cahill brilliantly controlled and finished a routine ball across the penalty area all in one vicious swipe of his left boot.

Pick that one out: Cahill recorded probably the best goal of the tournament so far in Porto Alegre

10 David Platt: England v Belgium, June 1990 (World Cup round of 16)

Platt's swivel to strike home a brilliant moment was one of England's most important goals - saving a nation from more dreaded penalties. The midfielder showed brilliant technique to secure England a place in the last eight - what would the Three Lions give for a moment like this in Brazil?
