Meet Patrick - the world's largest and oldest living wombat who celebrated his 29th birthday and has become a social media superstar overnight.

Tourism Australia took to Facebook to wish Patrick a happy birthday on Tuesday before the furry animal went viral within 24 hours, receiving almost 200,000 'likes', 35,000 shares and 9000 comments.

The 29-year-old wombat is believed to be the oldest recorded wombat living in captivity in the world as they usually live up to 5 years in the wild and 20 years in captivity.

Weighing in at 38 kilograms, Patrick was most commonly known for greeting his visitors in the car park in his wheelbarrow back in his younger days, to which he has now retired from this duty and lives in his pen.

The cuddly animal was orphaned as a baby before he was taken in and hand raised by the owners of the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria.

Known as one of the park's longest members, the team have tried releasing Patrick back into the wild a couple of times but he couldn't defend himself against other wombats.

The park’s social media manager Lauren Rix said: ‘We always knew that Patrick was a very special wombat, but the huge social media response that he has received this week is incredible.

'Since Tourism Australia posted about Patrick, his Facebook page has grown by over 4,500 new followers and he has attracted the attention of television news media,' she said.

'It’s safe to say that his birthday this year will be extended into a week of celebrations here at Ballarat Wildlife Park.'

Despite his age celebrations and fame, Tourism Australia also posted that Patrick has never had children or any female wombats in his love life. Facebook users speculated that Patrick's single status may have contributed to his longevity.

Andrew Bufton posted on the birthday message: 'Hence why he's lived so long! No GF's!'

Pascal van Turenhout added: 'Thats proof women do take years of your life...'

And Tasha McAuley said: 'Haha maybe the fact he hasn't had any kids or a partner is why he has lived for so long.'
