A two-year-old girl is fighting for her life in an artificial coma  after her father threw her into a scalding hot shower to 'discipline her', leaving the toddler with  organ failure.

Father Alexander Sztasek, 26, initially claimed he did not realise the water was so hot when he placed his daughter Leonie under the shower at their home in Vienna, Austria.

He also said that he did not know she had been burned until the blisters started appearing hours later, according to local media.

But when questioned by police he admitted he had put the toddler in the shower to 'discipline her' and said he had also done this with freezing cold water in the past.

Medics said due to the severity of the burns the man would have realised what had happened.

The father also admitted that he did not immediately take the child to hospital and instead left her crying  for a day before finally deciding to take her for treatment.

She was put in the intensive care ward at the Vienna Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum hospital because of the severity of the burns on her back.

The extent of the child's injuries prompted medics to raise the alarm and alert social services.

An SMZ Ost hospital spokesman said: 'The condition of the little girl has worsened dramatically. She is now fighting for her life. 

'She is suffering from severe necrosis which is a consequence of the severe burns on her back. 

'A substantial portion of the skin has been quite simply destroyed and as a result it appears that her organs are also failing together with the skin.'

The father was  released on police bail on the condition he did not return to the family home or have any contact with his wife and two other children while the investigation continues.

His two young sons have been left with the 25-year-old mother Romana Suvic after an examination showed that neither appeared to have any signs of abuse.

Social worker Herta Staffa said: 'They are not seen to be at risk in her care. We will remain in contact with the mother to see whether she could imagine living with her partner again and to put in place a support network if he does return to the family.' 

The family was  previously investigated by the youth welfare office in 2012, but according to Ms Staffa, everything was found to be adequate.
