Salesman Sean Hills, 36, was jailed for five-and-a-half months at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and disqualified from driving for six years after footage of him swerving all over the A90 near Stonehaven was posted on Facebook

A drink-driver was jailed yesterday after a sheriff spent ten minutes watching footage of his erratic driving posted on Facebook.

Salesman Sean Hills was caught on camera by a motorist following him as he weaved and bumped his way along one of the busiest roads in the North-East of Scotland.

The footage, which was later posted on the social networking site, showed his BMW 4x4 veering across the A90 near his home in Stonehaven.

He then drove into the  Kincardineshire town itself, where he was stopped by a police patrol.

Hills, 36, was jailed for five-and-a-half months at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and disqualified from driving for six years. It was the second time he had been caught drink-driving.

In court yesterday, it had seemed that Hills might just avoid prison when Sheriff Christopher Shead initially agreed with Hills’s defence agent when he suggested a ‘substantial’ community  payback order might be an appropriate disposal.

But the sheriff then decided to accept the Crown’s invitation to come off the bench and view the film for himself – after which he said jail was the only option.

Hills was shaking violently and looked close to tears as the sheriff sent him down.

Sheriff Shead told him: ‘In these cases, the court has to balance the factors that are favourable for you against the public interest – in this case, whether custodial sentences are appropriate.‘The court has reached the conclusion that they are.’

Hills was pulled over by police in Stonehaven on January 13, just minutes after a witness filmed him driving erratically on the Aberdeen to Dundee road.

The court heard how Hills had set out to go to a business lunch, which was later called off.

Instead, he ended up at his mother’s house – where he consumed ‘a quantity’ of gin before leaving to avoid her as she returned to the house.

Defence agent Gregor Kelly said: ‘He received a call to say she was on her way home and stupidly decided to drive back to Stonehaven.

‘His use of alcohol has significantly increased over the past two years. Over the past 12 months, he has found himself drinking up to 30 units per day. He sought help last year when he realised his alcohol use was soaring.’

On his return journey, Hills at one point struck with a verge near his hometown.

The dramatic amateur footage of his driving, shot by a passenger in the car behind, emerged on social media a few hours after the offence was committed.

Hills turned off the A90 to go down the narrow Den of Logie entrance to Stonehaven where he was seen crossing double white lines in the middle of the road. He ended up near the busy town centre and was seen going up on the pavement – narrowly missing parked cars – before a police patrol car stopped him.

Hills appeared in court the following day, when he admitted dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drink or drugs.

Mr Kelly said businessman Hills had turned to drink in a bid to combat depression and anxiety. He had been the ‘linchpin’ of his sales team at an Aberdeen printing firm but had felt under increasing pressure in the aftermath of the recession.

He had been caught when over three times the legal drink-drive limit in Portlethen on August 23, having consumed ‘some beer’ before driving.

Hills was on bail from Aberdeen Sheriff Court when the further offences occurred on August 26, 2013.

Mr Kelly added: ‘It’s fully accepted that he should not have got behind the wheel on both occasions and that in  particular, on the second occasion, there was a grave danger to other road users.’
