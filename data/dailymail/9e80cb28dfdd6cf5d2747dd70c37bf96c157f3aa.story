Simona Halep continued her swift progress through the draw to ease into the fourth round at Roland Garros.

The world No. 4 is the highest seed left and the second favourite for the title behind Maria Sharapova despite only having reached one grand slam quarter-final.

Halep, who beat Britain's Heather Watson in round two, has not come close to losing a set so far and she chalked up a second love set of the week in beating Spain's Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor 6-3 6-0.

Last eight: Simona Halep reached the quarter-finals of the French Open by beating Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor

Routine win: Torro-Flor lost in straight sets to the world No. 4 Halep who hasn't dropped a set at Roland Garros

The 22-year-old should face her first real test in the next round against 15th seed Sloane Stephens, who is once again showing her best form in the grand slams.

Stephens is through to the second week at a sixth consecutive grand slam after defeating big-hitting Russian Ekaterina Makarova 6-3 6-4.

Stephens and Halep have met three times before, with the American having won the last two.

En route: Halep will face 15th seed Sloane Stephens in the last eight

Hard hitter: Stephens progressed after seeing off Russia's Ekaterina Makarova 6-3, 6-4 at Roland Garros
