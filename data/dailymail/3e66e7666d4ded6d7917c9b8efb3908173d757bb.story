Police have established a crime scene in the Hollywood Hills after a hiker discovered some skeletal remains in a wooded area on Tuesday.

The remains were found in the afternoon in the 3300 block of Bonnie Hill Drive.

A LAPD spokesperson told CBS Los Angeles that a call came in from the hiker around 4 p.m.

Scene: A hiker came across some skeletal remains in the 3300 block of Bonnie Hill Drive in the Hollywood Hills around 4pm on Tuesday, police say

Police have not yet determined if the remains are definitely human.

They are searching the surrounding area for any clues.

The crime scene is close to the home of Andrew Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J Paul Getty, who was found dead inside his home today in apparently suspicious circumstances. 

However police do not believe the two scenes are linked.

The investigation continues. 

Investigation: Police are now trying to verify whether the remains are human
