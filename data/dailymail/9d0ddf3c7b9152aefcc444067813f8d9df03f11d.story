A California businessman convicted in July of hiding millions in assets just to keep from paying child support and alimony after a nasty divorce was sentenced to 17 years and 8 months in prison Tuesday.

Steven K. Zinnel, 49, first submitted his fraudulent bankruptcy filing way back in 2005, but the wait ended in a major victory for prosecutors who managed to win an historically long jail sentence against Zinnel, who was also slapped with a $500,000 fine and forced to forfeit assets worth more than $2.8 million.

Things all began to unravel for Zinnel after he personally placed a call to the FBI while he was getting away with concealing some $4 million from the government.

Northern California businessman Steven K. Zinnel was sentenced to a whopping 17 years in prison Tuesday for concealing millions of dollars from his bankruptcy claim in order to avoid paying child support and alimony to his ex-wife and mother of two teen kids Michelle (pictured)

It was a fitting start to an investigation that spun upon the lengths the Gold River businessman went to hurt his ex-wife and keep as much money from her and their two teenaged children as possible.

'This case is more than a crooked businessman’s run-of-the-mine fraud. For Zinnel, this crime was personal. In these crimes, Zinnel showed his true nature: hateful, vindictive, and incorrigible,' read court papers filed by federal prosecutors.

Divorce proceedings for Zinnel and his wife and mother of his two children Michelle began in 2001 and, according to the Sacramento Bee, Zinnel had put millions in others' names by June 2006.

But keeping his considerable wealth from his wife apparently wasn't enough because it was that summer when Zinnel decided to call the FBI in an attempted to get his wife, who is a dental hygienist, investigated on charges she revealed confidential health information during their divorce hearings.

'It is hard to fathom what would lead
 Zinnel to call the FBI while he was in the middle of a successful 
multimillion dollar concealment offense,' wrote the federal prosecutors.
 'But it is uncontested that this is what happened.'

The
 call would get the ball rolling steadily towards Zinnel's imprisonment 
for 15 counts of money laundering and bankruptcy fraud.

Dirty deals: Zinnel was convicted of hiding millions in income from five different corporate entities and funneling it through a shell company with the help of his attorney Darien Eidson

Even before the call and well before his bankruptcy claim, records show Zinnel had made up his mind about how he planned to get back at his wife.

'In an angry email, he told his ex-wife that he intended to file bankruptcy and she would get nothing,' read court documents. 'By late 2001 and early 2002, his calendar entries and to-do lists reflect a man busy at work with the various corporations, individuals, and property at issue in the case.' 

Over the course of their investigation, the FBI and IRS found that Zinnel had worked with his attorney Derian Eidson and others to ensure all the money he continued to receive from his many assets was concealed or funneled through a shell company set up by Eidson.

All told, Zinnel was concealing money from five corporate entities with Eidsen's help.

Eidsen was convicted along with Zinnel on July 17.

U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley described Zinnel as 'narcissistic,' citing the defendant's repeated lies in bankruptcy and family courts.

Prosecutors initially wanted 17.5 to 20 years for Zinnel.

Prosecutors told the Sacramento Bee they believe Zinnel's 17 year sentence is the longest ever handed down for bankruptcy fraud in the Eastern District of California.

When he left the court, recordings caught Zinnel showing off that true 'hateful, vindictive, and incorrigible' nature once more in a call with his son.

As well as a remarkable ability to dole out blame.

'Daddy got railroaded,' the newly minted felon told the boy. 'This all started because of your mom.'
