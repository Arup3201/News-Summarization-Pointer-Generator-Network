Police are still investigating what caused the death of the family of five found dead in their Utah home at the weekend after preliminary autopsy results ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play. 

Today the first first photos emerged of Benjamin and Kristi Strack, 37 and 36, who were found dead at around 8pm Saturday night at their home in Springville, Utah by one of their sons.

The boy also found the bodies of his two brothers, Benson, 14, and Zion, 11, and that of their 12-year-old sister, Emery.

Preliminary autopsy results have ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play.

'The Medical Examiner has indicated that the next step is to continue the investigation through analysis of blood samples to determine what may have caused the deaths,' the Springville DPS said in a statement.

'Preliminary autopsy results for the family of five who were found dead in their home have ruled out any sort of violent assault,' Springville police said in a statement. 

Police Lt. Dave Caron said the cause of death has not been determined, and will not be until an analysis of blood samples is concluded.

Emery, 12, was found alongside her brothers and parents. The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom

The medical examiner's office provided no time frame for the release of results of laboratory testing.

The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom by an older son, who is believed to be 18, according to neighbors.  

Their son returned home and knew something was wrong because of how quiet the house was, said Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson, reported Deseret News.

He then went to his grandparents' home nearby to question their whereabouts, and returned with his grandmother to find the bodies.

Caron said someone either saw or talked to the family Saturday morning, but he was unsure about the last person to make contact with them. 

While a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death.

The front door of the house was open and the back door was cracked open before firefighters arrived, Caron said, and the gas could have ventilated before the test. 

The family's pets were all fine.

Asked whether foul play has been ruled out, Caron said, 'I don't rule out anything ... We haven't ruled out anything except there was no violent trauma. We're going to look at everything.

'I do know when I was in there (house) I didn't see anything that would suggest a struggle ... I saw nothing like that,' he added. 

A Facebook tribute page has been set up to remember the family.

One user wrote: 'I feel a part of me has been lost. My brother Ben was my best friend.

'We did everything together. He always made me happy when he was around. Emery, Benson and Zion it seems like yesterday I was helping them with home work and taking them camping. I remember Benson caught his first fish with us on the trip.'

Another user wrote: ' Ben is one of my best friends. He was always like a brother to me as we grew up. I will miss him so much. 

'His kids had the biggest smiles every time I seen them.'  

On the tribute page another user wrote: ' I sat in a couple parent teacher conferences with both Ben and Kristi. 

They were always so thrilled to talk with me about Zion, they were truly proud parents. 

'I had the privilege to have their sweet, smiling, energetic, big brown eyed Zion in my second grade classroom. The happiness and energy he brought to school with him every day was infectious.'

The duplex where the family lived is located on a road leading to a high school in the city of 30,000 located just south of Provo.
