A mother-of-three was left with a crushed pelvis and a broken spine after a woman who was five times over the drink-drive limit mowed her down in her own front garden - while she was on the school run.

Agnieszka Chrzaszcz, 28, had gone to pick up her children from school in Winklebury, Hampshire when she ploughed into Laura Percival, as she was carrying her four-year-old daughter.

Mrs Percival, 26, managed to throw her child to safety but took the full brunt of the blow, as Chrzaszcz's car flung her against her own front door.

Laura Percival, 26, pictured left, was left with a broken pelvis and spine after Agnieszka Chrzaszcz, 28, pictured right, ploughed into her while on the school run in Winklebury, Hampshire

The victim sustained four spine fractures, a crushed pelvis and a perforated bladder and is still struggling to walk eight months on. 

Now Chrzaszcz has been jailed for three years after admitting causing serious 
injury by dangerous driving - and leaving Mrs Percival unable to walk further than 100metres.

Mrs 
Percival - who has undergone ten operations since the crash - said: 'We 
have got what we wanted. We wanted to see justice done.

'It is not going to change anything but at least she is in prison for what she has done.

'I
 do not think it will give me closure because I have got to live with 
what happened and will see the scars for the rest of my life. But I have got to be strong and try my hardest.'

The court was told that the incident, which the judge described as 'truly frightening', unfolded in September last year when Chrzaszcz walked to pick up her son from Winklebury Infant School.

Prosecutor
 Simon Edwards said the Polish mother then climbed into her Honda 
Civic car which she had left by the school the previous day - despite having drunk half a bottle of vodka the day before.

Mother-of-three Mrs Percival, who has undergone ten operations since the crash, still suffers with a fractured pelvis and has no idea whether it will ever fully heal

The damaged Honda Civic, which was driven by Chrzaczsz while she was five times over the legal drink-drive limit. The car collided into Mrs Percival as she was leaving the house with her daughter Freya, 4. Mrs Percival managed to throw her daughter to safety but took the full brunt of the blow

She
 then reversed into three cars, before careering across a grassy area where she collided with Mrs Percival.

Brave
 Mrs Percival, who was carrying her daughter Freya, four, managed to throw her youngster to safety but was crushed against her own front door.

Although most of her injuries have healed, Mrs Percival still has fractures in her pelvis which mean she struggles to walk on crutches.

Even
 if she does recover from her pelvic injury, doctors have warned she will be more susceptible 
to osteoporosis, because of the weakness in her bones.

Mrs Percival, pictured here with her youngest child Corey, can now only walk about 100metres. She said the three-year jail term meant justice had been done

She
 effectively lives in a hospital bed set up in her front room and can 
barely manage the 100-metre walk to collect her children 
Freya, now five, and Harley, seven, from school.

Mr Edwards told Winchester Crown Court 
that Chrzaszcz had drunk half a bottle of vodka and cans of lager with 
Polish friends the night before the incident.

The defendant then jumped out of her car and shouted ‘no police, no ambulance’ even though Mrs Percival was hurt.

The injured mother now has to live in a hospital-style set up in her home. Even if she makes a full recovery, Mrs Percival could be more susceptible to osteoporosis because of the weakness in her bones, caused by the crash

Mr Edwards said: 'The defendant got out. Witnesses described that she smelled strongly of alcohol, was visibly drunk, and could not focus.

'Witnesses approached her and tried to prevent her from walking off. In fact, that was entirely unnecessary because she was too drunk to walk off.'

Officers arrested Chrzaszcz at the scene but she threw up blood when she arrived at the police station.

She was then taken to hospital before where she gave a reading of 392mgs of alcohol per 100mls of blood. The legal limit is 80mg.

Chrzaszcz was given a three-year jail sentence at Winchester Crown Court, above, after pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving

Later in interview, Chrzaszcz showed remorse but also claimed that she had fainted at one point before the collision, the court was told.

Louise Howard, mitigating, said Chrzaszcz was drinking a litre of vodka just to function at the time of the crash.

She has written a letter of apology to Mrs Percival following the incident - but the victim had found it too difficult to read.

Miss Howard said: 'She understands the consequences of her actions, and the impact it has had on Laura Percival and her family.'

Sentencing, Judge Keith Cutler said Chrzaszcz’s sentence had been cut from a possible five due to her early guilty plea and her remorse.

He praised Mrs Percival for her quick-thinking in throwing her daughter away from the reversing car.

The defendant, who moved to the UK from Poland nine years ago and has no previous convictions, was also disqualified from driving for three years.

Judge Cutler told Chrzaszcz: 'This court has listened with horror to your actions.

'For parents of the school to realise that one of their pupils’ mothers was so unfit through drink must have been truly frightening.'

Mrs Percival said she cannot bring herself to open Chrzaszcz’s letter.

She
 said: 'It’s there but I do not want to read what she has got to say 
because whatever it is, it is not going to change anything.'

After the case, PC Andy Green, from Whitchurch Road's policing unit, said he was pleased with the sentence.

He said: 'This is the most serious non-fatal traffic collision I have had to investigate in nine years of policing.

'I’m very happy with the sentence. It reflects the seriousness of the injuries Laura has sustained and the ordeal she and her family have had to endure.'
