Police now believe that the attempted 
abduction of a 22-year-old jogger is connected to the kidnapping and 
murder of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway.

The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found on October 11, six days after she vanished on her way to school.

After initial speculation about a 
possible connection to an attempted abduction in the same area of 
Westminster where Jessicaâ€™s body was found, police confirmed the 
connection on Monday October 22.

A clue? A tuft of blonde hair was found about a mile from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered prompting local station Fox 31 to link the evidence to the case

In the abduction attempt, an 
unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake in May about a 
half-mile from the Ridgeway home was grabbed from behind by a man. The 
attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was
able to escape.

According to The Denver Post, the woman described her attacker as a 
light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to
5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair.

'Police believe there may be a 
connection between the Jessica Ridgeway murder and the attempted 
abduction at Ketner Lake, and urge the public to specifically look for 
someone with a cross like this that matches the suspect's description 
from Ketner Lake,' Mr Materasso said.

This new line of investigation comes 
the same day that police found a tuft of blonde hair just a mile away 
from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered.

From missing to murdered: The Colorado 
schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 
miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her 
way to school

Someone walking in a field made the 
discovery at the weekend and comes just days after police found a wooden
cross which they believe may be a vital piece of evidence in the case.

A local news channel reported that the
source alerted police to the scene and a grid search was conducted 
while the hair was taken into evidence.

But Westminster police investigating her murder are dismissing claims that the hair is a definite clue in the case.

He told the Denver Post that so far there is nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with Jessica or is even human.

'We don't even know if this is dog 
hair yet,' he said. 'Like everything else, every tip we've gotten, it 
was taken and we'll take a look at it to see if it's connected.'

Another recent clue in the tragic 
investigation that police are examining carefully, appeared in the form 
of a wooden cross last week.

Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 
inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a
necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday.

Hope gone: After the grisly discovery of Jessica's body on October 11, the search for Jessica turned into a hunt for her killer

'Authorities are looking for someone 
who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased 
one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' 
Westminster Police Department Mr Materasso said in a statement.

Police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses.

The solid wood pendant has three 
vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a 
zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side.

'The cross appears to be a solid piece
of wood and the upper post portion is offset from the lower post below 
the short horizontal section,' Mr Materasso said.

He added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.'

Jessica was last seen beginning a 
short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of 
October 5. She never arrived.

A search by hundreds of law officers 
did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights 
and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't 
there.

Then, on October 7, Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home.

At about 5pm on Wednesday October 10, 
dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the 
foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working
on a credible tip.

The focus of their search was an 
abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining 
operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to 
hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes.

Police said they are not suspicious 
that Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle 
over her, had any involvement in the disappearance.

The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration
officials and state Department of Corrections were reviewing registered
sex offenders in the area, Yacone said without elaborating.

Investigators have received more than 
1,500 tips from the public. Authorities also have searched more than 500
homes and more than 1,000 vehicles but still need the public's help, 
Yacone said.
