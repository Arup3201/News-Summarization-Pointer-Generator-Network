Speculation is mounting that the President's chief of staff was been effectively forced out by Barack Obama's move to the left ahead of this year's election.

President Obama announced yesterday that 
William Daley, who was hired to forge links with big business and Congress Republicans, is stepping down from his post, making him his third chief
of staff to quit in three years.

Mr Obama has aggressively targeted Congress, which he says has blocked the workings of government, and is looking to strike a more populist economic tone ahead of his re-election campaign.

Moving on: President Obama announced at the White House today that his Chief of Staff William Daley, right, would be resigning and replaced by Budget Director Jack Lew, left

Mr Daley is resigning after only a 
year on the job - to return to his native Chicago and spend more time 
with his family, he says.

He will be replaced by 
Budget Director Jack Lew, whom the president called the 'clear choice' 
for one of the toughest jobs in D.C.

Mr Lew will be the third permanent chief of staff in Mr Obama's presidency - in the midst of a re-election year.

William Daley is a lawyer who made his career in banking. 

He is the son of Richard M. Daley, who was mayor of Chicago for 21 years.

Mr Daley served as Midwest Chairman of JPMorgan Chase from 2004 until President Obama picked him for chief of staff.

He was Secretary of Commerce under 
President Bill Clinton from 1997 until 2000 and helped with the passage 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Mr Daley has stepped down from his chief of staff post after just one year.

Mr Daley, 63, was considered a 
centrist Democrat with close ties to big business, having worked in the 
pharmaceuticals industry and as a top lobbyist for bank JPMorgan Chase.

Now that Mr Obama is in re-election 
mode, bashing business and the Republicans and seeking to define himself
in opposition to Congress, this could have made Mr Daley an awkward fit
in the White House.

'The Daley departure marks the end of
Obama’s attempt to look pro-business,' conservative commentator Phil 
Kerpen told Politico, predicting that the President would now be 
'playing to his ideologically motivated left-wing base'.

And a former top congressional aide 
for the Democrats told the Huffington Post: 'Bill Daley was brought in 
for two things: He has a good connection to the business community and a
record of working with Republicans.'

The former aide claimed that Congress
Republicans 'don't want to be worked with', meaning that Mr Daley ended
up as 'an ineffective chief of staff'.

Mr Obama's difficult relationship 
with Congress - which has worsened rather than improved while Mr Daley 
has been in office - deteriorated further last week when he took 
advantage of a one-day Senate 'recess' to appoint Richard Cordray to 
head a new consumer watchdog body.

Michelle Obama was 'distressed' by the dominance of Chicago politics by 'white Irish Catholic' families, according to a new book.

The Obamas, by New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor, claims that when Mrs Obama worked for the city's mayor she complained that 'power in Illinois was locked up generation after generation by a small group of families'.

Bill Daley, who has just resigned as White House Chief of Staff, is a member of one of the families supposedly criticised by Mrs Obama.

During the 1990s she worked for his father, Mayor Richard J. Daley. The current mayor of Chicago is Richard M. Daley, brother of the former Chief of Staff.

The Obamas were particularly 'horrified' when Valerie Jarrett, now a close confidante of the President and First Lady, was forced out of her high-ranking job at Chicago's City Hall in 1995, according to Ms Kantor's book.

Mrs Obama's hostility to Chicago's dynastic politics may help to explain Mr Daley's mysterious resignation yesterday.

She is also reported to have clashed with Rahm Emanuel, Mr Daley's predecessor as Chief of Staff.

'Clear choice': Jack Lew, left, has been Mr Obama's budget director since July 2010, and also served as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton

Rahm Emanuel (2009-2010) -
Previously serving as a top adviser to President Bill Clinton, Rahm 
Emanuel is no stranger to politics. He was announced as President 
Obama's chief of staff two days after he was elected president. Mr 
Emanuel resigned in 2010 to run for mayor of Chicago. He won that 
election, and still holds the post today.

William Daley (2011-2012) -
William Daley also served in the Clinton administration as the 
secretary of commerce until he resigned in 2000. From there he became 
chairman of Al Gore's failed presidential campaign against George W. 
Bush. After a stint as JPMorgan Chase's midwest chairman, he got back 
into politics, becoming Mr Obama's chief of staff in January 2011. He 
resigned today.

Jacob Lew (2012-) -
New Yorker Jacob Lew, or Jack, has two separate stints as presidential 
budget director - once under Bill Clinton and most recently under 
President Obama - and deputy secretary of state under Clinton's wife 
Hillary. With the departure of William Daley, he will become President 
Obama's chief of staff next month.

Mr Daley, 63, has previously stated 
this would be his last year with the Obama administration, and would 
hang on to see the president through his tough re-election bid.

But today he expressed to his boss a 
desire to get back to his family in Chicago, where Daleys have dominated
Windy City politics for decades.

He's
the brother of recently retired Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and the 
youngest son of legendary Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.

Mr Obama chose Daley to be his White 
House chief of staff back in January 2011, but the former banker and veteran 
political fighter has had a somewhat tumultuous tenure.

In the very least, the job has not seemed like the best fit for him.

He was brought in to improve relations with the business community, 
GOP lawmakers and others with whom he had built ties over the years.

His attempts to create a ‘grand 
bargain’ to solve the debt and deficit row fell apart in the face of Tea
Party hardliners, who refused to back down.

In November, it was reported that Mr
Daley was handing over many of his day to day tasks to Pete Rouse, one 
of Mr Obama's close allies.

Despite those assertions, Mr Obama today said that Mr Daley had performed 'extraordinary work' in an 'extraordinary year'.

White House officials said that to 
the degree Mr Daley deserved blame for any missteps, he also deserves 
credit for his work during a remarkably demanding year that ended on a 
high for Obama, with a political victory over House Republicans in 
getting a payroll tax cut extended.

Mr Obama said: 'No
one in my administration has had to make more important decisions more 
quickly than Bill. And that's why I think this decision was difficult 
for me.'

A Democratic strategist familiar with the decision said Mr Daley was not pushed out the door.

The strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the timing was driven by Mr Daley's personal reflection, yet it also only would have gotten more awkward for the White House had he not left before Mr Obama's tone-setting State of the Union.

Praise: In a speech today, President Obama applauded Mr Daley as a man who had performed 'extraordinary work' in an 'extraordinary year'

Questionable departure? Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, right, denied that he resigned his post amid strained tensions with First Lady Michelle Obama, left

Mr Daley was also criticised for hurting middle 
income families with the NAFTA trade deals he helped sign while serving 
as Commerce Secretary under Bill Clinton between 1997 and 2000.

Both Mr Daley and Mr Lew stood at Obama's side today as the president delivered brief remarks, but neither man spoke.

Mr Daley replaced Rahm Emanuel, who is now Chicago's mayor.

According
to a new book examining the relationship of President Obama and his 
wife Michelle, Mr Emanuel departed amid strained tensions with the first
lady.

The
book, titled The Obamas, mentions 
several examples where Mr Emanuel tried to avoid working with Mrs Obama 
after his experiences with Hillary Clinton during Bill Clinton's 
tenure as president.

Speaking in Chicago today, Mr Emanuel 
disputed that reporting, saying, 'I’m very proud to have worked for the 
president and the first lady, and [my wife] Amy and I are very proud to call them 
friends.'

Mr Daley served as commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton and ran Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign.

Stepping
in now is the mild-mannered Lew, who began his career on Capitol Hill, 
where he spent nearly a decade as principal domestic policy adviser to 
the late House Speaker Tip O'Neill.

Mr
Lew, 56, has worked for Obama as a deputy secretary of state before 
becoming budget director, the same position he held in the Clinton 
administration.

Mr Lew will officially become the president's chief of staff at the end of the month.
