Nick Clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories

Nick Clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories.

The Lib Dem leader said prosecutors were ‘relying on 13th century laws’ to put reporters on trial and condemned the lack of a defence for those ‘uncovering information in the interests of the public’.

He is the most senior political figure to raise concerns about the multi-million pound police investigation into tabloid newspaper payments for information, which critics condemn as a ‘witch hunt’.

Operation Elveden, which began in 2011 and has cost taxpayers more than £15million, has seen dawn raids, large numbers of arrests and lengthy bail periods for suspects.

But of the 20 journalists whose cases have come before the courts only two have been convicted, and last week one of those, a Sun journalist, was invited to lodge an appeal against his conviction.

The rejection of cases by a succession of juries has led to MPs calling for the police and the CPS to look again at the remaining cases.

Prosecutors have pursued the newspaper journalists and public sector workers using the ancient common law offence of misconduct in public office.

But accused reporters have argued they are pursuing stories which were in the public interest.

Speaking at his party’s campaign launch in Abingdon, Oxford, Mr Clegg told the Daily Mail the public interest defence was ‘just far too opaque in too many of our laws.

He also called for a ‘proper review and proper reform’ of the misconduct law.

He said: ‘I have long been concerned that the laws of the land are not clear enough on the public interest defence for journalists and other people who are covering information in the interests of the public.’

He added: ‘It’s just far too opaque, in too many of our laws, exactly what is the strength and nature of a public interest defence.

‘I would like to see that clarified in law, my party has always advocated that.

He added: ‘The fact that prosecutors are relying on 13th century laws, that we don’t have an up-to-date definition of what a public interest defence is, shows the need for a proper review and a proper reform of the law in this area.’

Ten days ago, four Sun journalists were cleared at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories.

A former soldier and his wife were also cleared of the misconduct charge after they were accused of leaking the information.

On Friday, the first journalist to be convicted of paying a public official as part of the Elveden probe had her conviction quashed.

The former News of the World reporter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a six-month suspended sentence after being found guilty of paying a prison officer for information at the Old Bailey last November.

In turn, the officer was jailed for three-and-a-half years for misconduct in a public office and his friend was given 30 weeks behind bars.

All three, who cannot be named for legal reasons, launched an appeal and the Lord Chief Justice ruled that their convictions should be quashed.

He found the trial judge Charles Wide had ‘misdirected’ the jury on a key aspect of the misconduct in a public office offence relating to the seriousness threshold required for conviction.

In his ruling, Lord Thomas Of Cwmgiedd also said that in a democratic society the media played an important role ‘in making information available to the public when it is in the public interest to do so’.
