Graffiti has plummeted as youths take their anger away from spray cans and onto Twitter, Scotland's top police officer has claimed.

Sir Stephen House said social media has offered disaffected people a new platform to vent ideas which a decade ago 'would have been sprayed on the side of a building'.

Scottish officers have now seen vandalism, malicious damage and similar crimes halve in just five years, from 28,000 to less than 14,000.

Sir Stephen told the Scottish Police Authority: 'Social media in some instances has replaced graffiti as a way of making your views heard.

'We have had to deal with offensive comments made on Twitter. My view is that ten to 15 years ago, that would have been sprayed on the side of a building.'

The downward trend probably deserved to be studied for a university thesis, he added.

Despite the claim, graffiti has continued to be used as a way of getting political messages across.

In protests against the rise in tuition fees in 2010, students defaced London monuments including Nelson's Column and the statue of Winston Churchill with messages including 'Education for the masses' and '**** the police'.

And 'artistic' graffiti has also seen a comeback, thanks partly the popularity of the mysterious Banksy, whose career began in Bristol and has brought him worldwide fame.

Many artistic pieces of graffiti no longer form part of crime figures after councils and police began working with graffiti artists, handing them underpasses or walls where they can paint without fear of prosecution.

When it came to gang slogans, Sir Stephen pinned the drop in offences on computer games.

'We have a lot of success against gangs,' he said. 'Some of it has been that the Xbox and PlayStation generation is less of a gang generation. They are not out in the street so much.

'You can correlate that with things like the general view that youth fitness is not where it was.

'Why? Because they are not out playing football to all hours of the day and night. They are inside on the Xbox, but they are not outside, they are not doing the damage.'

But he added: 'That takes us back to social media. People staying indoors may be committing some sorts of crimes like cybervandalism, but it is not visible to the rest of the community.'

Sir Stephen told the Authority, the force's oversight body, that traditional vandalism, fire-raising, malicious damage, and similar crimes, had fallen dramatically in recent years.

There were 13,453 such offences, most of which are against property, in April-June 2014, committed across Scotland in the first financial quarter of the year.

That is down nearly eight per cent on the same period a year before, and the figure has more than halved since 2009-2010, when it stood at 28,146.

The chief constable added some of the fall was due to the force focusing on 'local policing and high-visibility patrols'.

He said: 'We have seen a significant drop in anti-social behaviour and we see fewer complaints of drinking in public complaints.

'Some of these things tend to go with vandalism, graffiti and damage to property.'

Sir Stephen also praised architects and designers for helping to make it harder to commit vandalism - and harder to break things.

He said: 'I think we should also give credit to intelligent design as well. Things are harder to vandalise than they used to be.

'It is most cost-effective to build something that is difficult to vandalise, say a bus shelter, than it is to replace it.'

Police are now investigating more Twitter crimes - although a recent investigation of racist abuse against an Irish-born Glasgow councillor, Feargal Dalton, fell through after officers failed to obtain information from the social media giant.

Sir Stephen stressed that abuse was abuse wherever it occurred.

He said: 'When challenged, some people say 'I didn't say that, I put it on Twitter'. Well, it is the same as saying it.'

Police Scotland itself now has 571,610 followers on Twitter - a rise of four per cent over the summer.
