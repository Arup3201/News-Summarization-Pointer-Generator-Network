Tributes have been paid to a British construction worker apparently killed by terrorists in Nigeria.

Brendan Vaughan was named by Foreign Secretary William Hague as the British national believed to have been murdered - along with six other foreigners - at the hands of captors.

Mr Hague condemned the likely killing as 'cold-blooded murder' and said he would work with the Nigerian government to bring those behind the attack to account.

No further details about Mr Vaughan 
have been released but tributes have begun to be posted on Facebook by 
friends of construction worker Brendan Vaughan, who is originally from 
Leeds but now lives in Thailand.

One of Mr Vaughan's friends - Peter Dixon - left a message on the site saying 'Rip mate'.

Mr Vaughan's Thai girlfriend, Orasa Arpornkaew, wrote: 'You're always in my heart.'

Dom Cooney posted: 'Can't believe it. he was like an ox.'

Mr Vaughan's page includes details of where he was working in Nigeria and photos of armed protection guards at his compound.

It appears he had left West Yorkshire and started a new life in Thailand with Ms Arpornkaew.

Online: A video was posted online by Islamist terror group Ansaru, claiming that they had killed seven hostages captured in February. Nigeria's President claimed today that some of the hostages might actually still be alive

Operation: Reports appeared on a local Nigerian website two weeks ago saying that five British planes were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja and linking them to a rescue operation for the hostages

Yesterday, Mr Hague said in a statement: 'This was an act of cold-blooded murder, which I condemn in the strongest terms.

'My thoughts are with his family, and the families of the other hostages, who will be devastated by this tragic loss.

'I offer them our deep condolences at
 this terrible time, and know that the thoughts of people up and down 
our country will be with them.'

He added: 'Responsibility for this 
tragic outcome rests squarely with the terrorists. I am grateful to the 
Nigerian government for their unstinting help and co-operation.

'We are utterly determined to work 
with them to hold the perpetrators of this heinous act to account, and 
to combat the terrorism which so blights the lives of people in northern
 Nigeria and in the wider region.'

Foreign Secretary William Hague called Mr Vaughan's murder. He also vowed to work with the Nigerian government to bring the killers to justice

Those kidnapped included three 
Lebanese citizens and one each from Britain, Greece, Italy and the 
Philippines - all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company 
with an operation in Bauchi state, local officials said at the time.

A message from Ansaru, the extremist 
group behind the February 16 kidnappings, said on Friday that the 
hostages were killed after British warplanes were reported to have been 
seen in the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi by local journalists.

In a statement, the group said: 'As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed.'

Commenting on the claim, the Foreign 
Office said: 'There are a number of deployments as parts of various 
engagements in Africa which will include the movement of assets.'

Earlier yesterday, an Italian foreign ministry statement said all seven hostages had been killed in this latest case.

The statement said: 'It is an 
atrocious act of terrorism, against which the Italian government 
expresses the most firm condemnation, for which it can find no 
explanation, except barbarous and blind violence.'

The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 said in a statement that 'the information available points to the death
 of a Greek citizen' and his family had been notified.

The statement said the ministry 
believed no operation was mounted to free the hostages and the extremist
 group at no stage either communicated or expressed demands for the 
release of the hostages.

Ansaru said a video of the killings 
would be posted online. An online image accompanying the posting 
appeared to show a gunman standing over bodies.

Statement: The message, attributed to Ansaru, posted online claiming that the seven hostages had been killed

Local media: A report, published by Leadership Weekend, claimed that five British 'jet bombers' were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja

Ansaru cited two local media reports claiming 
that British planes had arrived in Nigeria to assist a rescue operation 
for the terrorists but the MoD categorically denied that British troops 
were involved in a rescue

A British hostage was killed by his captors in Nigeria in March 2010 when a UK Special Forces rescue operation ended in tragedy.

Chris McManus was executed by gunmen as members of the Special Boat Service and Nigerian soldiers moved in on the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists’ hideaway.

Fellow hostage, Italian Franco Lamolinara, was also killed. The pair had been held for ten months.

Footage of the 28-year-old engineer blindfolded alongside three armed men was broadcast, showing the terrified hostage pleading for his life. 

The botched rescue was triggered when – after months of searching – the SBS found the heavily protected location where the men were being held.

Mr Cameron said authorities had decided to go ahead with the rescue after receiving 'credible information about [the men's] location'.

They claimed a message from Nigerian 
President Goodluck Jonathan which said the government would do anything 
in its power to free the hostages also sparked the decision to kill the 
hostages.

Ansaru previously issued a short 
statement in which it said its fighters kidnapped the foreigners on 
February 16 from a construction company's camp at Jama'are, a town about
 125 miles (201km) north of Bauchi, the capital of Bauchi state.

The attack saw gunmen first assault a local prison and burn police trucks, authorities said.
Then the attackers blew up a back fence at the construction company's 
compound and took over, killing a guard in the process, witnesses and 
police said.

The gunmen appeared to be organised 
and knew who they wanted to target, leaving the Nigerian staff unharmed,
 while the foreigners were quickly abducted, a witness said.

In January 2012, Ansaru declared 
itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main 
terrorist group, analysts say.

Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western
 education is sacrilege', has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings 
and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north.

Boko Haram has been blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to a recent estimate.

Yesterday, a military spokesman said 
at least two soldiers and 52 Boko Haram fighters were killed in 
Maiduguri in fighting after a visit by the president.

It is not the first time hostages have been killed in Nigeria.

British national Chris McManus and 
Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara died in a failed rescue bid in March
 last year as Nigerian troops and UK Special Boat Service commandos 
tried to end their nine months in captivity.
