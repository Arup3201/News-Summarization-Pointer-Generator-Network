Strong painkillers doled out by doctors in their thousands are doing more harm than good, according to a respected medical body.

Addiction to codeine, morphine and oxycodone, and other opioid drugs is reaching dangerous levels, the American Academy of Neurology has said.

Frequent overdoses and a boom in serious side effects in the US means doctors should curb their use of the prescription drugs, the society said.

It called for random drug screenings for patients who are prescribed the medication in a bid to tackle addiction.

The statement, which highlights concerns about overprescribing in the US, will be examined carefully in Britain, experts said last night.

There has been a rapid rise in painkillers taken this side of the Atlantic, with more than 60million such prescriptions written in 2012, a 30 per cent rise in five years.

Charities estimate there are 32,000 painkiller addicts in Britain, mainly those who initially took the pills to ease a minor ailment.

Dr Gary Franklin of the American Academy of Neurology, writing in the journal Neurology, said: ‘There have been more deaths from prescription opioids in the most vulnerable young to middle-aged groups than from firearms and car accidents. Doctors, states, institutions and patients need to work together to stop this epidemic.

‘More than 100,000 people have died from prescription opioid use since policies changed in the late 1990s to allow much more liberal long-term use.’ 

Dr Franklin said 50 per cent of US patients taking opioid painkillers for three months are still on the same drugs five years later.

Opioids such as codeine and morphine are strictly controlled in the UK. All but the weakest doses are available only with a prescription, with just 8mg of codeine allowed in over-the-counter forms.

But doctors are concerned about rising numbers of stronger codeine pills and other opioids prescribed by GPs.

Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ‘Like the US, there has been a marked increase in opioid prescribing for pain in the UK … it remains unclear as to whether the harms … of this increased prescribing are the same.’

But Professor David Nutt, the former government drugs adviser, said: ‘It is all very well them saying that in the USA, but they have access to medical marijuana which we do not in the UK. When people are in constant pain it would be inhumane to remove their pain relief. We need an alternative.’

A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which forms British drugs policy, said it would look carefully at the US research, adding: ‘Opioids such as codeine and morphine are scientifically proven, effective medicines for pain relief and their benefits outweigh their risks for the majority of people.

‘There are already strong warnings in the product information for all opioids about the known side effects, including the risk of tolerance or dependence.’

Regular use of codeine can heighten sensitivity to pain, research has found.

A study found codeine gives much less initial pain relief than morphine, but results in the same increased sensitivity to pain over time.

Researcher Jacinta Johnson, of Australia’s Royal Adelaide Hospital, said: ‘In the long term it has the effect of worsening the problem.’ 

Professor Paul Rolan added that it ‘could be detrimental’.
