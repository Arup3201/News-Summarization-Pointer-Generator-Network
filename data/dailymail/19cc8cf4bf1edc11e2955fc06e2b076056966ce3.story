Michael Fallon, who was moved into Mr Cable's department in David Cameron's reshuffle, said he wanted Britain to 'salute' wealth creation 'and stop thinking of new ways to tax it'

A new Conservative business minister has said Britain should 'salute' wealthy people who risk their own money to create jobs, rather than look at new ways to tax them.

Michael Fallon called for an end to the 'politics of envy in this country' and said he wanted to scrap 3,000 regulations and make it easier to sack underperforming staff.

The former Tory deputy chairman and strongly pro-business MP was appointed as Vince Cable's number two as one of the key features of David Cameron's controversial reshuffle.

His appointment, along with Matthew Hancock was seen as an effort to restrain Mr Cable, who has been dubbed the 'anti-business' Business Secretary by the Conservative Right.

Mr Fallon suggested that there will be bruising political clashes ahead and admitted that the coalition has not done nearly enough to help boost growth.

On taxing the rich, he told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We need to salute that and stop 
thinking of new ways to tax it - that kind of wealth creation. That's an
attitude I want to help change.

'We need to get away from the 
politics of envy in this country and salute those who not only create 
wealth but risk their own money to create jobs for other people.

'Above all I want business to feel it has a strong Conservative champion in the department.'

Mr Cable today  insisted he was happy to work with new Tory ministerial
colleagues.

He said that cuts to red tape should be concentrated 
on complex immigration and tax rules and  insisted he would not budge in his 
opposition to 'fire at will' employment laws.

He remained convinced of 
the need to increase tax on the wealthy.

Proposals for sweeping away bureaucracy are due to be published tomorrow and a new industrial policy on Tuesday as the Government continue efforts to kick-start its programme.

Mr Cable told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that he considered Mr Fallon a 'very, very able and experienced politician' with whom he could work as well as he had other Conservative colleagues.

'I like working with intelligent people with strong views. It makes politics more interesting. I have got David Willetts who is very, very able and likeable Conservative,' he said.

'We work well together. I know I will with the new team.'

But he also made clear that he retained strong views in areas that could put them on a collision course.

Asked about Mr Fallon's promised bonfire of regulations, he said it would only happen if it could be done 'in a rational way' and without badly downgrading protection for employees and the environment.

And he suggested that the main focus should be on immigration and tax.

'If I am allowed to wield my axe in those areas I will be delighted to do so,' he said. 'We will burn a lot of regulation but in a rational way.'

He made clear that he had 'set myself very firmly' against the call for a 'no-fault dismissal' system made in the David Cameron-commissioned Beecroft Report - and pointed out that Mr Fallon was not responsible for that area.

'It is very important that we do these things in a way that does not massively undermine people's sense of security.

'That is why we are not going down the no-fault dismissal line,' insisting it had little support among businesses.

And asked about Mr Fallon's comments about the 'politics of envy' that sought to tax wealth creators, he said:

'I think wealthy people could contribute more.

'There is massive wealth inequality. I do believe that entrepreneurs should be properly supported. But I continue to believe that we need effective wealth taxation.'

Mr Cable backs the introduction of a 'mansion tax' on Â£2 million-plus properties.

Mr Fallon denied he had been parachuted into the department to 'keep an eye on Vince Cable'

'I'm there to keep both eyes on growth,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

A motion to be debated at the Liberal Democrat conference will level serious criticism at Tory efforts to water down employee rights.

It complains of 'irresponsible calls for policies with no clear evidence of effectiveness, such as introducing no-fault dismissal, where the evidence suggests this would weaken confidence further'.
