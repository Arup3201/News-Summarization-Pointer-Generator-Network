Michael Keane gives a rueful smile. The subject of coloured footwear has cropped up and has inadvertently led to him revealing his less than flattering nickname.

‘They call me “the referee” because I’m the only one who wears black boots these days,’ the Manchester United defender explains. ‘But I can’t be wearing those bright yellow ones, can I? It’s my job to kick the players wearing bright yellow boots, isn’t it?’

Cue fits of laughter. This is the first time Keane, who is with England’s Under-20s squad at the Toulon Tournament, has given an in-depth interview but the topic of what he puts on his feet gives an insight into his character.

Keane has an old-fashioned approach, a player who enjoys hard work and puts the team first, never searching for compliments; those are values that will serve him well as he strives to put himself in the spotlight at Old Trafford.

This is going to be a big season for the 21-year-old, who grew up idolising Sir Alex Ferguson’s all-conquering sides, particularly as there could be an opening under Louis van Gaal to advertise his talents.

Should Van Gaal listen to advice from his new right-hand man, he will discover that Keane was in contention to make his first appearance in the Barclays Premier League the night Ryan Giggs, in his role as caretaker manager, gave youth its head against Hull City.

‘I was on the bench,’ said Keane, who had loan spells last season at Derby and Blackburn and made one of his two United starts in the League Cup against Aldershot.

‘I thought there was a chance that I was going to play but I was just happy to be involved. I’d have liked to have got on as I think I would have done well.

Dutch of class: Incoming United boss Louis van Gaal (R) is renowned for giving young players a chance

‘I’ve heard the new manager likes to bring young players through and that’s always been the way at United. With Giggsy staying on, that can only benefit the young players. He’s an idol for every player that comes through. You see how professional he is and his enthusiasm for training every day no matter the fact he has played for 20 to 25 years at the top level.

'He comes in every day wanting to give his best. Hopefully, we’ll have a good pre-season and prove ourselves. If we do that, we’ll have a chance to play.’

There is quiet confidence in the way Keane — whose twin, Will, is also at United and in Toulon — speaks. Trying to fill the boots of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand will not be easy task for whoever Van Gaal selects but Keane’s belief comes from advice the departing Ferdinand has given to him.

Hero worship! Michael Keane admits having Rio Ferdinand's name on his shirt as a youngster

‘When I was young I always had Rio’s name on the back of my shirt,’ says Keane, one of four brothers who were brought up in Stockport. ‘Rio was my idol when he first joined United and he still is. Luckily, I’ve managed to train with him for a few years. He talks to everyone.

‘It’s sad to see him go. He was a great person to have around and he was great with the young lads. He speaks to everyone and always gives you advice. He talks to me about positional things.

'If I make a mistake in a game, he will ring me and tell me what I should do better. He wants to give you feedback. It was a surprise at first but now I just see him as a friend. I know I can go to him whenever I want.

‘Rio’s a really nice guy. Sometimes footballers get those type of reputations but he’s not like that at all. Behind the scenes there’s no one better to have around.’

Can he take his shirt, then? ‘I hope so,’ comes the reply. ‘That’s the dream. I still think I’ve got a chance of making it at United. While I still think I’ve got that chance I will stay and try to prove myself.’

Big things: England Under 20 coach Gareth Southgate insists that the Keane twins have a bright future

Before that, there is the pressing matter of helping England wrap up their first tournament in Toulon by grabbing third place. They play  Portugal this afternoon and Keane will be given the chance by Under-20 head coach Gareth Southgate to lead by example once again.

‘For Michael and Will, they would benefit from working with a coach like Van Gaal who will open their minds to different ideas,’ said  Southgate.

‘Michael is a player who can use the ball and is very comfortable at stepping out with the ball. He’ll be better for the experience here.’
