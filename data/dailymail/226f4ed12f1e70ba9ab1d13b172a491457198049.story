Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney hailed his side's patience as they beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Emirates on Saturday evening.

Rooney grabbed United's second goal, after Kieran Gibbs inadvertently put the ball into his own net to open the scoring, and the forward was open in admitting how vital it was to secure Louis van Gaal's first away win in charge of the club.

'I think it's a very important victory,' Rooney told Sky Sports. 'We weathered the storm at times, particularly in the first half, and hit them on the counter attack when we knew they were vulnerable. It was quite a different game; they had possession and we hit them on the break.

'We rode our luck at times - our goalkeeper was fantastic for us today - and we hit them with two good goals.'

Manchester United were forced to play an inexperienced back line with Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett, but Rooney was quick to praise the young centre-back partnership.

'I think it's a massive result for us. We had two very young players in terms of Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett, and they've coped very well. This will give us a lot of confidence.' 

'We're taking each game as it comes, it's been an indifferent start for us. We hope now that we can go on a good run of games. We feel like we should be taking six points from our next two home games. We want to build a bit of momentum going into the new year.'
