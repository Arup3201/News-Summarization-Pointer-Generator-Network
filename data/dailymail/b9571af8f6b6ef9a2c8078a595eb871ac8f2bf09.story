A 24-year-old man stabbed his mother to death in the face on Monday morning, police claim.

Patrick Wayne Tyson, of Sandy Springs, Georgia, told police he returned home from jogging at 7am to find his mother Cathleen Tyson, 57, bleeding on the floor and two men in the house who fled.

However, under questioning his story became inconsistent, the crime report said.

He was charged with malicious murder, aggravated assault with intent to commit murder, and using a knife to commit a felony.

Mrs Tyson was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics who responded to a 911 call.

An initial investigation suggests she was hit in the head with a blunt object then stabbed several times.

Sandy Springs police Sgt Ron Momon said in a statement investigators recovered a blood covered knife at the scene.

Tyson has been booked into the Fulton County Jail and is being held without bond.
