Young drivers aged 18 to 30 are most likely to wear inappropriate footwear such as flip-flops behind the wheel, a study has shown (file image)

From flimsy flip-flops to towering stilettos, millions of drivers are risking their lives by wearing unsafe footwear behind the wheel.

Some motorists even admit to driving barefoot, putting themselves and other road users in danger, new research suggests.

Young drivers aged 18 to 30 are most likely to wear inappropriate footwear, with nearly one in three (29 per cent) confessing to donning high heels or sandals for a car journey.

That compares to just one in six (15 per cent) of older drivers aged 50 to 65.

Almost twice as many young motorists as older drivers wear inappropriate footwear while driving, according to a poll of 1,000 drivers by fuel giant Shell.

Experts say drivers who do not wear flat shoes with a firm grip could find their feet slipping off the brake or clutch pedals of their cars, putting them at risk of having a crash.

More than half (57 per cent) of young motorists believe they are better drivers than anyone else on the road.

Yet, almost two thirds admit to driving with one or no hands on the wheel (59 per cent) and accelerating through amber lights (56 per cent), compared to a third of older drivers (34 per cent and 32 per cent).

Almost twice as many young motorists also wear inappropriate footwear while driving.

Furthermore, a third of young drivers (33 per cent) confessed to using their mobile behind the wheel, compared to just five per cent of their older counterparts.

The research for Shell's smarter driving initiative found older motorists from the Midlands were kings of the road.

Drivers aged 50 to 65 from the Midlands are not only the safest but also the most fuel efficient.

However, those aged 18 to 30 from Wales and the south west of England are the least safe or fuel efficient.

The snapshot of the nation's driving habits ranked younger drivers aged 18 to 30 and older motorists aged 50 to 65 on their driving attitudes towards fuel efficiency and safety, including everything from smooth driving to wearing inappropriate footwear behind the wheel.

Older drivers are more fuel efficient, making a conscious effort to drive smoothly (82 per cent compared to 57 per cent of young people), turn off the engine when idling (51 per cent compared to 37 per cent of young people), and remove excess weight from the boot (49 per cent compared to 36 per cent of young people).

TV's Carol Vorderman, Shell's smarter driving ambassador, said: 'Today's challenge is about helping all British drivers understand just how easy it is to drive more fuel efficiently today.'

Peter Rodger, chief examiner of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'Modern engineering has done a great deal to make our cars more fuel efficient. But smarter driving is not just about engineering, it's also about the way you drive.

'Most people don't realise making a few simple changes, such as smooth braking, cornering and accelerating, can go a long way in increasing fuel efficiency and becoming a smarter driver.'
