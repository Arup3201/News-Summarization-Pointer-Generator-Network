‘Good luck finding a Scot,’ smirked one of the bosses in the office when they asked me to choose the all-time greatest combined team from north and south of the border, even as the Auld Enemies gird their loins for this week’s revival of the most ancient fixture in football’s international calendar.

Easier than he thinks.

The assembling of a mighty composite XI ended up balancing six Englishmen with five Scots.

To squeeze in the highest feasible quota of superlative skills requires the selection of a majestic back three in a 3-3-1-3 formation.

The starting point, beyond argument, is the Englishman who just happens to be the world's greatest ever goalkeeper:

GORDON BANKS - World Cup winner in 1966, immortalised by that flying save from Pele’s leaping header, stands imposingly at the base of this awe-inspiring team.

ALAN HANSEN - one of football’s most cultured centre backs, in his golden years at Liverpool the most decorated of all Scots in the old First Division/Premier League.

Gordon Banks won the World Cup for England and makes the No 1 spot and Alan Hansen earns his spot

BILLY McNEILL – the colossus at centre half for Celtic, who he captained to Britain’s first winning of the European Cup.

BOBBY MOORE – one of the two greatest defenders of all time, in company with Franz Beckenbauer. The only England captain to raise the World Cup aloft, his statue still guards the gates to Wembley

GRAEME SOUNESS – tackled like a vice, passed like a laser, scored when it mattered, one of the great all-time, all-round, most-feared midfield men

BRYAN ROBSON – as Captain Marvel for Manchester United and England, embodied all the Souness attributes and was the bravest of never-say-die competitors

BOBBY CHARLTON – not only the most creative of all English midfield players but also the scorer of stupendous goals, 49 of which still keep him in possession of the England record – after 44 years

PAUL GASCOIGNE – self-destructed before completely fulfilling his phenomenal potential but this maverick remains one of England’s most naturally gifted prodigies

Bobby Charlton (right), shooting against the Scots in 1965, still holds the England goalscoring record with 49

TOM FINNEY – still the greatest of all English footballers, as deadly at centre forward as he was unplayable on the wing, quite simply a genius

DENIS LAW – scorer of 237 goals for Manchester United and 30 in 55 games for Scotland, the archetypal poacher-striker, widely held to be his country’s second best player ever and their only winner of the Ballon d'Or.

KENNY DALGLISH – The Greatest Scot, maker and taker of wondrous goals, both conductor and virtuoso of the team, football’s Albert Einstein.

Subs: John Greig, Jim Baxter, Kevin Keegan, Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Greaves

Apologies – to countless others who have made our game so beautiful.

Kenny Dalglish, beating Colin Bell in the air in 1973, is the best player to have pulled on a Scotland shirt
