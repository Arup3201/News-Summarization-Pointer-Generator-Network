For months Kim Kardashian and Kanye West looked set to exchange vows in France, even listing Paris as the wedding destination on their invite.

But after it emerged this week that the couple will actually say 'I do' in Florence, the rapper has revealed why the Italian city is so close to their heart.

In an interview with Florence's La Nazione newspaper on Friday, the 36-year-old said: 'I adore Florence. I love Italy and the Italian lifestyle.

'To tell you the truth, I already came to the banks of the Arno [river] with Kim last year, just the two of us, incognito.'

He continued: 'I think that our daughter North was conceived here among the Renaissance masterpieces.

'It was our first honeymoon. It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world—for me the most beautiful in Europe.'

(The rapper took Kim on a tour of Italy 
for her 32nd birthday, visiting Florence in late October 2012 after 
stops in Rome and Venice.)

The groom made it clear he is feeling giddy ahead of the big day.

'[I'm] 
very happy,' he said. 'I am a romantic: for Mother’s Day I gave Kim a 
wall of flowers. Family is everything for me, the antidote to the 
pressure of fame. Family and creativity relax me. I am happy to create 
for my family.'

West has been staying in Florence and quietly studying with fashion designer Ermanno Daelli, who is one owner of the fashion house Ermanno Scervino.

He said Kim, 33, inspires him and said they turn to each other for fashion advice.

'I consult her on elegance and what I wear,' he revealed. 'And she does the same for me. Today as a musician I like to dress in a less showy way than in the past.'

He is working on his music too, adding: 'I am composing a whole album, Made in Florence.'

MailOnline exclusively revealed on Friday that the pair's fairytale wedding will take 
place at a sixteenth century castle in Florence, with a dark history.

The pair will marry next weekend in front of 1000 guests at the famous Florentine landmark Forte Belvedere, Scervino confirmed.

The venue, a fortress built for the ruling Medici family of Florence, is a spectacular setting for their nuptials.

The
 venue has a tragic past, however. Two young people fell from the 
ramparts in 2006 and 2008, prompting the authorities to close the venue.

It
 was finally reopened last year and Kanye has been hard at work 
organising the surprise wedding for bride Kim, Italian 
friends say.

The couple rented the fort, located next to Florence's famed Boboli Gardens, for 300,000 euros ($410,000) and a Protestant minister will preside over the ceremony, spokeswoman for Florence mayor's office said Friday.

Kanye proposed to the reality star on her 33rd birthday in October 2013, renting out San Francisco's AT&T Park for the occasion.

This is the first marriage for West, who was previously engaged to designer Alexis Phifer.

It's the third trip down the aisle for Kardashian. She was wed to music producer Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2003, and spent 72 days married to professional basketball player Kris Humphries in 2011 after tying the knot in in a lavish ceremony broadcast as a two-part TV special.

The couple was featured on the cover of Vogue magazine's April issue, with Kardashian wearing a wedding-style dress.
