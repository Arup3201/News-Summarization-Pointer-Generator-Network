Thousands of holidaymakers' plans have been wrecked following the collapse of a travel firm specialising in villa breaks.

Air Parade, which traded as Luxury Villa Escapes and Villa Parade, ceased trading yesterday after weeks of speculation.

Its main trading brand was Villa Parade which sold villa holidays around the Mediterranean, mainly packages to Spain and Portugal, as well as Florida.

Travel association Abta estimates the Huddersfield-based firm has more than 1,300 future bookings, which means thousands of UK holidaymakers will be forced to find alternatives for their breaks, despite paying Villa Parade months in advance.

Customers with accommodation booked in Mallorca had raised concerns about the company over the past few months, with allegations made that Villa Parade was advertising and selling weeks into properties for which it no longer had contracts with.

As reported by MailOnline Travel last month, customer Lorraine Beasant and her family were evicted by police and the owner of the five-bedroom villa they had paid £1,450 for to Villa Parade in 2013.

The owner claims he had no knowledge of the booking and had cancelled the contract with Villa Parade last year. However, at the time, the company denied this.

Last week, Villa Parade won a High Court injunction forcing rival firm Travelopo to retract allegations it had made to the now-bust company’s customers, emailing them to say the owners of the properties had not been paid by Villa Parade, calling the bookings ‘not valid’.

Travelopo claims it did so after being contacted by scores of Villa Parade customers who had seen their accommodation cancelled at the last minute, alleging Villa Parade was selling dates in villas that it did not have contracts for.

Abta said up to 70 Villa Parade customers were currently abroad but said their holidays should go ahead as normal.

All current accommodation bookings will be cancelled, although customers will get their money back via Abta's financial protection scheme.

It also has 400 forward bookings for flight packages which will also be cancelled, with refunds paid via the Civil Aviation Authority under the ATOL scheme.

A spokesman for Abta said an investigation into Villa Parade had been launched last month following the allegations.

He added: ‘Abta Code of Conduct investigations are always conducted very thoroughly and they were ongoing at the time of the company’s failure.

‘If Villa Parade had been found to be in breach of the Code it would have been liable to serious penalties.

‘Now that the company has ceased trading ABTA will support customers through the process of arranging refunds.

‘Customers can find out more about this on our dedicated web page www.abta.com/villaparade.’

No one at Air Parade was available for comment.
