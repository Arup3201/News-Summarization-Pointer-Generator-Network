The abduction and suspected murder of five-year-old April Jones shocked the nation and sparked an outpouring of grief that saw crowds gather for a procession through her Welsh hometown in a show of support for her devastated family.

But as hundreds of people turned out in Machynlleth to sympathise with the family following Mark Bridger's arrest on suspicion of killing the schoolgirl, internet trolls compounded their misery by posting false accusations and insults aimed at April's relatives on Facebook.

Almost 1,000 people have joined the online group, called Mark Bridger - Guilty Or Not Guilty - Have Your Say, which police have vowed to shut down.

Vanished: April went missing after she was seen getting into a car near her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in the rural Welsh town of Machynlleth

Bridger, 46, who is known to April's family, has been charged with murder, child abduction, and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Facebook users had posted comments about April's heartbroken mother Coral Jones, 40, on the webpage, and criticised the pink ribbon campaign she devised to help keep the search for her cherished daughter at the forefront of peoples' minds, according to a report in the Daily Star.

Others posted speculation about what happened to the little girl, despite the fact that public discussion of the case is forbidden under contempt-of-court laws until the trial concludes.

Some members of the group reportedly claim to be from around April's home town of Machynlleth.

A police spokesman told the newspaper: 'We will take immediate steps to get this closed down.'

Today some comments and users had been deleted from the page, which is visible to members only.

A week ago more than 700 people gathered at the Bryn-y-Gog estate and walked through Machynlleth in a silent procession to St Peter's Church to pay their respects at an emotional service for missing April.

Many people in the crowd wore pink ribbons, symbolising the fading hope the schoolgirl could still be alive.

The five-year-old is still missing despite an exhaustive search which initially saw members of the public join police officers in combing the areas around Machynlleth for clues to the youngsters whereabouts.

April's parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 44, were 'too upset' to attend the service.

Police looking for April have denied the search is scaling down 13 days after she first went missing.

Officers from all over the UK have joined in the hunt for her, while volunteers from the ambulance service and the Coastguard are also continuing to search.

A spokeswoman for Dyfed Powys Police said: 'Over the weekend the search for April Jones continues with teams carefully examining many different areas.

'The area in and around Machynlleth is large and we are continuing to put a huge level of resource into the search. As time passes and we work through the detailed plan, we will of course conclude our searches in particular areas.

'Whilst we have almost completed the searches in the town centre area, outside this small vicinity there is still a lot to do. The search continues at the same level of intensity that we have seen all last week.

Police are continuing in their hunt for April and have widened the search area to around Machynlleth

'We have a number of areas and locations identified that require a detailed, methodical forensic search.'

Superintendent Ian John, who is leading the search, said yesterday his search teams remain committed to finding the little girl.

The area searched last week alone would take one person almost nine years to complete on their own, police said.

Specially trained officers are continuing to support April's family who are being updated about the search operation.

A fundraising walk in support of the April Jones fund, set up by Machynlleth Town Council, is to take place in Penarth tomorrow, while thousands of pink ribbons, which became a symbol of hope for the youngster being found, continue to be put up across Wales.

The ribbons were also worn by the Wales football team during the national anthems and line-ups ahead of their match against Scotland at Cardiff City Stadium last night.

Mark Bridger, 46, appeared in court on Wednesday accused of abducting and murdering April, and of unlawfully disposing of and concealing her body with intent to pervert the course of justice.

Mr Johns said yesterday his teams had almost completed their searches in Machynlleth town.

He said that over the weekend they would focus the search operation in the Ceinws area and the surrounding towns and villages.

The search plan was developed between the force's own police search advisers and the national police search centre, which has consulted worldwide with others with similar experience.

'The detailed plan that we've put together is very robust and that is the main drive for our search operation,' he said.

'It's a very professional and methodical search. It is a very emotional time for the town of Machynlleth here, but we are police officers, we are professionals and we've got to try to take some of the emotion out of that so that we can do the best job for the family.'

April vanished from outside her home as she played with other children in the mid Wales town of Machynlleth on October 1.
