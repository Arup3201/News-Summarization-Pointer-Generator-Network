Germany will ‘find ways’ to keep Britain in the European Union, including curbing migrants claiming benefits, a senior minister in Berlin said last night.

Steffen Kampeter, Germany’s deputy finance minister, said it would be a ‘catastrophe’ if the UK severed ties with Brussels, including bringing ‘disadvantages’ for the British economy.

He insisted that ‘UK belongs to Europe’ and suggested more could be done to meet Downing Street’s demands to tackle ‘benefit tourism’.

Relations between Germany and Britain have been tested in recent weeks, after Angela Merkel made clear that the general principle of freedom of movement is 'not negotiable'.

It was claimed that the German Chancellor was ready for Britain to leave the EU if demands were made to limit migrant numbers.

Mr Kampeter insisted the European project was based on ‘values’, in which Britain played a key part.

He told BBC2’s Newsnight: ‘The great United Kingdom is part of this European integration. Culturally, philosophically and economically.

‘That they have questions on the size of the integration and special questions on bureaucrats in Brussels I very much agree. But there’s no doubt that the UK belongs to Europe.’

David Cameron has promised to stage a renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

He pledged to put freedom of movement at the heart of the talks with EU leaders.

Senior Tories have suggested that unless the UK can extract a better deal from Brussels, it would be better to leave than remain in an unreformed institution.

But Mr Kampeter said efforts would be made to find a way to stop the UK heading to the exit door.

He said: ‘We’re not alone in saying that the Brits should stay on. We want them in and we will find ways to offer Britain a good chance to stay in.

‘And please do not forget opting out is not economically very preferable to the United Mr Cameron is expected to use a speech in the next few weeks to set out his plans to curb EU immigration.

Number 10 insiders insist he is determined to tackle the 'huge numbers of people' who move to the UK for work.

Mr Cameron has stressed: ‘The right to go and work in another European country should not be an unqualified right.’

However, Germany insists it will not allow changes to the principle of freedom of movement. Mr Kampeter added: ‘This is quite clear. But I clearly add that I understand that migration within the EU, into social security systems of single countries, is something we have to finance.

‘But I don’t think that the answer is to limit the free movement of persons. I think we need a European-wide legislation that makes clear that free movement does not mean free movement into social security systems.’

He said Germany has ‘similar problems’ and minsters are ‘trying to address them’.

It follows a ruling by the European Court of Justice which said jobless EU migrants cannot move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves.

It ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job, and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers.
