A couple are going to have to completely redecorate their nursery and fund a new wardrobe for their newborn baby boy after being told they were expecting a girl.

After buying dresses, kitting out a pink nursery and choosing a girl's name, James Radley and Clair Evan, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, were delighted when doctors told them they were expecting a girl in October.

After five months preparing for the birth of their new daughter, Clair, 23, began having contractions in the early hours of Wednesday.

Surprise! Clair Evans and gave birth to son Hugo after being told she was having a girl

But following a quick labour at Hull Women and Children's Hospital, the couple were shocked when rather than the new daughter they were expecting, she gave birth to a healthy, 8lb 7oz baby boy.

Clair said: 'As soon as I had given birth we asked the midwife if she was OK and the doctor put him on me and said he was a boy.

'I said some choice words and James started laughing. I thought, 'it can't be a boy, everything I have bought is pink!'

'Of course we were just happy he was healthy.

'When they placed him on me, I thought 'what do I do now?''

The couple were told at a 20-week scan that they were expecting a baby girl and  chose the name Eden Elsie

The couple spent £400 on decorating their nursery and buying clothes for the daughter they were expecting

The couple, from Beverley, Yorkshire, have named their new arrival Hugo and James Radley said he was shocked but delighted.

The 34-year-old who has a three-year-old daughter, Olivia, from a previous relationship, said: 'I am over the moon.

'It is all a bit surreal. The first thing I did when we got home was order Hugo a Newcastle United outfit.'

The couple were told at a 20-week scan that they were expecting a baby girl and had already chosen the name Eden Elise.

Clair said: 'We were really happy. I was in particular because I think every girl wants a girl and we thought it would be nice for Liv to have a little sister.

'We got all of the nursery things and co-ordinated her room. I had a baby shower and got lots of girly things.'

The couple also revealed how friends and family initially did not believe them when they were told Clair had given birth to a boy.

Clair said: 'We are quite a comical couple so we weren't surprised when people said they didn't believe us.

Think Blue: The couple had a pink baby shower and rushed to get their nursery decorated in time after moving house. They are waiting to redo the room for their son

'We had to send people a picture of him. I'm just thankful I didn't buy a pink pram.'

The couple had a mad dash to buy new baby clothes on Thursday morning.

James Radley said: 'We found out on Clair's 20 week scan that we were expecting a girl.

'Two weeks later we named her Eden-Elsie and we spent the next 18 weeks buying pink clothes.

'We moved house just three weeks before Clair was due so it was a massive rush to get our pink nursery decorated in time.

'Clair had a pink baby shower and we had a wardrobe full of pink outfits for our new arrival.

'We spent around £400 on our unborn baby girl so when Clair went into labour we had no idea that we were about to meet a boy.

'We just turned to each other and laughed when we were told he wasn't a girl.

'Obviously we were thrilled to have a son but it was a huge shock.

'All the outfits we had bought to the hospital were pink so I had to dash out and buy him something blue to go home in.

'Our parents thought we were joking when we said we had a boy and we had to send them pictures for them to believe us.

'We named our baby boy Hugo and we are now waiting to redecorate his nursery.

'Our three year old, Liv, keeps calling him Eden though as she's still a little confused that he's actually her brother, not sister!'
