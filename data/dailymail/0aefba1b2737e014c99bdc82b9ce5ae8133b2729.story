Sir Michael Parkinson said the quality of television reporting has gone down as a result of our 'youth obsessed' culture

Sir Michael Parkinson has criticised the quality of television today, blaming falling standards on an obsession with ‘youth’. 

The former chat show host, 78, singled out BBC1’s The One Show for criticism, dismissing it as an ‘agreeable frolic’

He said serious current affairs programmes such as Tonight, presented by Alan Whicker in  the 1950s, and the late Sir David Frost’s chat shows were a ‘vanished species’, adding that both presenters were 'inspirational heroes'.

The One Show, presented by Alex Jones and Matt Baker, is no match for 
the 1950/60s series, which attracted audiences of seven million, according to Sir Michael. 

But he added: ‘Television in the 60s and 70s was a thrilling and exhilarating business to be part of.

'There were few rules, focus groups had not been invented - or if they had they were generally ignored. 

‘The newly formed ITV stations were run by gifted entrepreneurs and the BBC by an adroit mix of showbiz and journalism. 

Producers were unencumbered by such irksome obstacles as compliance, health and safety and frustrating commissioning procedures.’

He told Radio Times today: ‘The biggest difference of all between then and now was defined . . . by David Blunkett [MP] when he described the ‘worship’ of the “cult of youth” by modern TV bosses as “an unstoppable fetish”.

'A vanished species': The former presenter said the quality of programmes such as those presented by Sir David Frost (left) and Alan Whicker (right) no longer exists

‘To indicate how much this obsession has distorted the standards set by the likes of Frost and Whicker, let us compare Tonight ... with its present-day equivalent.

‘The One Show is an agreeable frolic but it’s hardly a finishing school for a generation of television reporters.’

Sir Michael, who announced earlier this year that he had prostate cancer, added: ‘When you compare the kind of talk show David Frost developed with its modern counterpart you realise you are dealing with a vanished species.’

He continued: ‘Why don’t we have a daily, topical, irreverent magazine programme like Tonight? 

While technology had changed much of TV for the better, much of the content was worse, he said.

'Where is the talk show that is not masquerading as a comic frivolity, and why since the 60s have we never produced anything as innovative and inspiring as TW3 [That Was the Week That Was]?’ he said in the magazine.
