October and November are usually the months when British women breathe a sigh of relief. 

The colder months and lack of beach time mean we can reach for that extra chocolate hobnob and hang up the razor. 

But sadly, the Gillette Venus won't be going into retirement just yet - there's a new trend for wearing bare legs all of the way through the winter months. 

Cara Delevingne and Victoria Beckham are pioneering the AW/14 fashion of tight-less legs, no matter how cold the weather gets. Here is Cara at The Face of an Angel' film premiere in London on October 18 

Stars like Victoria Beckham, Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse are pioneering the new fashion for naked pins. 

Despite the weather taking a drastic dip in the last couple of weeks, there has barely been a single pair of opaque tights spotted on the legs of A-Listers in London and New York. 

It's a brave decision and not one to be made at the last minute - bare legs in late autumn require a number of preparations. 

They include round-the-clock taxis, streak-free tan, a spare pair of emergency socks and leggings and totally fuzz-free calves.

Suki Waterhouse wore a warm leather jacket to walk the red carpet at the Love, Rosie film premiere in London on October 6, but decided against tights 

The Femail desk are divided on the trend, so here two of the team give their reasons for and against in the battle of the winter hosiery: 

'It's all very well for models like Suki Waterhouse and Cara Delevingne to be wandering around London in November with their pins out, but this isn't an easy trend for us mere mortals. 

'It's hard enough already to get out of bed on a November morning - a fifteen-minute trek to the tube with my calves bared to the wind and rain would mean the alarm clock never moved off snooze.

'It isn't just the comfort though, nothing slims the leg faster than some black hosiery, in fact, it favours curvier girls over stick insects. 

'On top of that, they allow a girl to wear short skirts that would look extremely tarty if accompanied with acres of fleshy thigh.

'This is definitely a trend that is best left to stars and their monthly holidays abroad for tan top-ups, Dukan diets and chauffeur-driven limos.

'Finally, if it's good enough for the Duchess Of Cambridge, it's good enough for me.'  

'Of course I wear tights. They are very practical. A cheap and easy way to stay warm and – more importantly – hide winter legs.

'And this is my problem with them. As well as being entirely unsexy, tights are lazy. They are the sartorial equivalent of scraping your hair back when you know you should have washed it but ran out of time.

'Which is fine every once in a while but they absolutely shouldn’t be a key part of your wardrobe in autumn/winter/whenever.

'Women with bare legs look more put together and definitely more stylish. You wouldn’t find Carine Roitfeld, Angelina Jolie or SJP rocking a bobbly opaque.

'The good news: going tightless doesn’t have to mean acres of bare legs for those of us without supermodel pins. Trousers, jeans, midi skirts = all acceptable non-tarty ways to not wear tights when the temperatures dip a bit.

'So there’s really no excuse to choose the easy (lazy) option every day of winter.'

Alexa Chung has long been a fan of the bare leg. Here she is pictured at the Chanel fashion show on September 30 in Paris 

Model Poppy Delevingne shares her sister Cara's penchant for a bare leg. Here she is at the A String of Naked Lightbulbs film premiere in London on October 28 

Taylor Swift has some of the longest legs in Showbiz and she likes to show them off. Here she is in New York on October 30 

Victoria Beckham shunned tights at a party in the Burberry shop in London last night 

Model Hannah Dodd also wore a naked leg to last night's Burberry party, despite temperatures in the capital dropping to as low as five degrees 

Jo Whiley also wore a naked leg last night - to the Music Industry Trust Awards 

British model Charlotte Wiggins wore no tights to the Burberry party, along with a flat ankle boot. It is considered one of the hardest naked leg looks to pull off. 

Scarlett Johansson skipped the tights to join Eddie Redmayne for a private screening of 'The Theory Of Everything' in New York last night
