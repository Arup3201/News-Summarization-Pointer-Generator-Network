Former NFL star Andre Rison has revealed how he wasted $1 million on jewelry, bought three cars in a season and even once lost back-to-back houses to compete with teammates, sending him broke.

The ex-millionaire spent a fortune trying to look rich when he hit the big time, splashing out thousands of dollars at nightclubs for his entourage of 40 people and throwing down $100 tips.

But the 46-year-old's recklessness came at a price - he was forced to declare bankruptcy due to overdue child support debts, barely escaped prison and now  works as a student assistant coach at Michigan State.

Extravagant: Former NFL star Andre Rison has revealed how he wasted $1m on jewelry and bought three cars in a season just to keep up with teammates

Rison shared his incredible story of going from extreme wealth to financial ruin in ESPN’s 'Broke' documentary, which also explored the flashy lifestyles of other pro athletes.

'When you have cash, you create debt,' 
Rison said. 'You spend until you’ve got nothing left… I should have 
saved a lot more money. I should have saved a lot more money.'

Rison played 12 seasons in the NFL after being selected in the first round of the NFL Draft  in 1989.

In 1995, he signed a five-year, $17 million contract to the Browns, which was then the most lucrative ever for a wide receiver, according to Grantland.

He made at least $19 million over his career, with base salaries ranging from $175,000 in 1990 to $2.8 million in 1996.

Celebrity Networth estimates his current fortune to be just $50,000.

But his sudden wealth and fame eventually took its toll. The competitive player admitted he had no idea about the tax system and felt pressure to 'keep up with the Joneses'.

'Now all of a sudden you’ve got this bank account you control. You can go to it, pull out anytime, put in any time, but at the time we were only pulling out,' he said in the documentary. 'I guarantee I spent a million dollars on jewelry ... We were draped in jewelry.'

The Michigan native shared tales of buying multiple cars within a season to compete with teammates  and spending lavishly at nightclubs.

'How much is this [car]? It doesn’t matter, just get it,' he said.

'We were going to new levels. We were making it snow. You start throwing $100 bills instead of 
fives. So you’ve got a competition going on now.

'I’d
 be lying on the bed knocked out (after getting back from the club) with
 $10,000 lying on the floor. I’ve got another $5,000 in my pocket. You 
might find another $7,500 in the pocket in my coat.'

Rison's rise to fame in the 1990s 
coincided with 'the first intersection of hip-hop, profligacy, romantic 
obsession, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and comic books', Grantland reported.

According to the ESPN documentary, NFL players wanted to be entertainers, competing with each other on and off the field with the flashiest cars, bling and social life.

During his first decade in the NFL, 
Rison was called 'Bad Moon' Rison, known for talking trash, berating 
coaching staff and teammates and skipping meetings.

His rocky relationship with Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes, the rapper from TLC, during the 1990s was infamous.

The couple appeared in an Atlanta courtroom in October 1993 after an incident in which he’s alleged to have hit her and fired a gun.

Their volatile relationship again made headlines the following year when Lopes set a fire in a bathtub of Rison's mansion that spread to the rest of the house until it burned to the ground.

In 2001, a year before she died, he rapped with Lopes on a song called 'Rags to Riches'.

But the star's major fall from grace came last year when he was sentenced in federal court to five years' probation and required to pay more than $300,000 in restitution for failure to pay child support.

Rison was convicted for failing to pay more than $10,000 of child support between August 2008 and August 2011.

In addition to the penalties for past due payments, and as a condition of his probation, Rison is expected to continue monthly child support payments of close to $2,350 per month.

The documentary claims that 78 
percent of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial 
stress two years into retirement. Many tend to find money tight in the off-season when the paychecks cease.

'A
 stunning number of athletes, especially in the NFL where you’re paid on
 a week-to-week basis, are living paycheck to paycheck quite literally,'
 Sports Illustrated writer Pablo Torre said in the documentary, mlive.com reported.
