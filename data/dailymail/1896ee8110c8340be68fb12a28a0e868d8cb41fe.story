The Government will today confirm long-awaited compensation for villages blighted by fracking as it paves the way for millions of acres to be explored, it has been reported.

Ministers are firmly behind shale gas drilling, with energy minister Michael Fallon attacking 'myths' about its safety and the chancellor, George Osborne, halving the tax on firms' profits.

Today they will confirm a promise that villagers will get £100,000 and one per cent of revenue from every fracking well, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The process involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure until it cracks

The move is an apparent attempt to boost public support for fracking just days before firms are given a new wave of provisional licences to drill.

Ministers are preparing to identify huge areas that should be explored, the Telegraph added.

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure to blast it open and release gas which is trapped inside.

Campaigners warn it is catastrophic for the environment, including causing earth tremors and contaminating the water supply.

One site in Lancashire was suspended briefly last year after the test drilling caused small earthquakes.

But the government supports exploring 
the divisive technique, saying it will boost the country's energy 
supplies at a time of uncertainty.

A statement in August said 'government policy seeks to increase security of supply', adding there was a 'continuing role for gas in the energy mix and support for shale gas exploration'.

Tax cuts: George Osborne promised new incentives for fracking firms in his Autumn statement

The process is only at a test phase in Britain, but has already come under intense scrutiny.

More than 1,000 activists set up camp earlier this year in Balcombe, East Sussex, in a bid to stop the firm Cuadrilla from drilling a test well.

Backbench Conservatives are also worried that their rural constituencies will turn on them if the government swings too far in favour of fracking.

But during last week's Autumn statement, George Osborne said: 'The country that was the first to extract oil and gas from deep under the sea should not turn its back on new sources of energy like shale gas because it’s all too difficult.

'[There will be] a new tax allowance to encourage investment in shale gas that halves tax rates on early profits.'

Greenpeace, which has launched a legal challenge against fracking in Britain, estimates that up to 20 million acres (32,000 square miles) of countryside are being assessed by the government.
