The anti-obesity drive by the Government is being overseen by a firm receiving millions of pounds to promote junk food, it has emerged.

PR firm Freud Communications is being paid £3million a year to run crucial public health campaigns – including Change4Life, the drive to combat obesity.

But while supposedly encouraging the nation to eat healthier, the firm is also earning millions a year to promote junk food firms including Mars, KFC, Pepsico – makers of Pepsi, Walkers crisps, and Tropicana fruit juice – as well as ASDA.

Conflict of interest? A television commercial for the Government’s Change4Life anti-obesity campaign

The disclosure will lead to renewed claims ministers are failing to address the crisis because they are too ‘cosy’ with the industry. 

It comes after a major report in the British Medical Journal found that key scientists advising ministers on obesity were receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds for research from the junk food industry, including the likes of Nestle and Mars.

There has been particular suspicion over Change4Life’s schemes offering families money-saving vouchers for seemingly healthier products – which happen to be made by junk food firms. These include Smart Swaps and Sugar Swaps deals which give the public discounts on items such as Pepsi Max, Uncle Ben’s Rice Time ready meals – made by Mars – and certain ASDA products.

A number of those involved in the voucher schemes also pay Freud Communications for their marketing, including Pepsico, Mars, ASDA and Warburtons.

This has prompted further suspicion they are simply hijacking Change4Life as a free advertising ploy. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘There has to be a conflict of interest. It’s a cosy deal.’

Public Health England, the Government agency tasked with tackling obesity, would not say how much Freud is paid to market Change4Life. But accounts on its website show £2.73million was given to the firm in the past ten months, to promote Change4Life, as well as run campaigns on cancer awareness and smoking. The other arm of the Government’s obesity policy, the Responsibility Deal, has also been criticised for letting manufacturers set their own goals for making products healthier. Freud won the contract for Change4Life in 2012 and is solely responsible for its publicity.

Sheila Mitchell of Public Health England said: ‘Agency groups of this high quality are always bound to have a mixed portfolio of clients.’

Freud would not comment.
