Education Secretary Michael Gove dismissed claims state schools are 'amoral' as nonsense

A private schools boss has been condemned by Michael Gove for claiming state schools are turning out ‘amoral’ children.

The
 Education Secretary reacted with fury after Richard Walden, chair of 
the Independent Schools Association, suggested many state school pupils 
end up with no sense of right and wrong.

Mr
 Gove told the Daily Mail he was speaking ‘nonsense’ and said private 
school heads increasingly fear their sector is threatened by 
fast-improving state education.

Mr
 Walden claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a 
‘moral compass’ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better 
academic results.

Too many 
state school staff operated in ‘a climate of fear’ which meant they 
failed to provide children with an enriching education, he added.

Fee-paying
 schools devote more time to extra-curricular activities, a broad 
curriculum and personal, social, health and economic development – 
meaning their students were able to ‘distinguish the good from the bad 
and the true from the false’.

Mr
 Walden, head of £6,867-a-year Castle House School in Shropshire, which 
caters for two to 11-year-olds, made his provocative claims in a keynote
 speech to fellow heads at his association’s annual conference in 
Warwickshire.

‘Schools are 
turning out too many amoral children because teachers cannot find the 
time to teach the difference between right and wrong,’ he said.

‘It
 seems that the only results that matter are those which have created 
added value in terms of raising a pupil’s statistical level from one 
stage to the next, and parents are increasingly buying in to this 
notion.’

But Mr Gove 
insisted: ‘This is nonsense. State schools are getting better in every 
respect – from delivering a more rigorous education to ensuring children
 leave school with the right values.

‘Only
 a few weeks ago, the head of the independent King’s College School in 
Wimbledon admitted state schools are improving so fast they are 
increasingly becoming a threat to private schools.

‘When
 I visit a school which gets great academic results it is always the 
case that everything else about the school is also brilliant; the sport,
 the community involvement, the best drama. Wasting talent, by telling 
millions of pupils that academic success is not for them, would be truly
 amoral.’

The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) questioned the
 values being instilled by private schools – claiming they had turned 
out many pupils who had gone on to work in the City and helped cause the
 financial crash.

Russell 
Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, said: ‘I don't think there is 
evidence to support an amoral generation emerging from our schools. In 
many ways, the coming generation has higher standards than our own. 
Indeed, one has only to look at sectors with high proportions of 
publicly-schooled people – like those who led us into the financial 
crash – to doubt the truth of this proposition.

‘Values
 are not just found in the curriculum but in the way you teach the 
curriculum, in the behaviour policies and code of conduct, in the way 
adults treat children and each other. Teachers in state schools would 
love time for greater breadth and extra- curricular activity, but they 
are teaching strong values nonetheless.’

A
 Department for Education spokesman said: ‘All schools should provide a 
broad education and have a duty to promote the wellbeing of their 
pupils. Our reforms will reduce the number of tests that children take 
and have given teachers the freedom to use their professional judgement 
to tailor lessons.

‘We are 
also giving all schools more freedom to offer extra-curricular 
activities that will build character. These include sports matches, 
debating competitions, cadet training and inspirational careers talks 
from outside visitors. We want more schools to take up these freedoms.’
