The teenager who fought back against years of bullying when he slammed his tormentor into the ground at a western Sydney high school three years ago said the 40 second viral video has changed his life.

Footage of Casey Heynes lifting a 12-year-old above his head and flooring him at Chifley College in Mount Druitt, west of Sydney, in 2011 reached hundreds of millions of people across the world.

Since the smack down, Casey, now 19, has been working as an anti-bullying advocate and has no plans to retire his talks anytime in the near future.

'There was a girl on Facebook who wrote and told me I saved her on that day. She had decided to kill herself that day and when she heard my story she didn't do it,' Casey told ninemsn.

'That really stopped me. It made me feel proud of myself and proud that I could help her. But I feel sad too. There are a lot of people like that. They tell me I helped them but I don't know them and I don't know their full story.'

Casey said he was still trying to deal with his long-lasting fame after the 40 second mobile phone footage went viral.

The then 15-year-old was even invited onto the stage at popstar Justin Bieber's Melbourne concert where he was introduced to the crowd as a 'real life hero'.

'Before people would drive past me and go "you're a fatty", now they drive past and yell out "you're a legend". It's a boost to your confidence but it messes with your head too,' he said.

Casey, who was in year ten at the time, said three years of bullying had left him contemplating suicide.

'I was really putting myself down and I was down at that level. All the crap just kept on piling on,' he told A Current Affair back in 2011.

Casey had gone to collect a timetable at his school when the bully, Ritchard Gale, punched him repeatedly in the face, triggering his now famous reaction

He said at the time he thought the bully's friends would join in the attack 'that's why I picked him up and dropped him'

'(The bullies would) call me fatty, slap me across the back of the head and trip me and throw water bottles at me.

'It happened practically every day.'

'I wanted to diffuse the situation.'
