Three members of staff have been suspended following an incident relating to the care of an elderly patient at Mid Staffordshire hospital trust.

An investigation has been launched after a member of nursing staff raised concerns over a 'lack of nursing care' on November 15.

The hospital was the subject of a 2009 inquiry which found as many as 1,200 people may have needlessly died due to poor care over four years.

A Mid Staffordshire Trust spokesman refused to reveal whether the suspended members of staff are nurses, and declined to comment on the elderly patient's condition.

Julie Hendry, Director of Quality & Patient Experience at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘This incident, which was reported quickly by nursing staff, is in respect of a concern about lack of nursing care provided to an elderly patient on the 15th November at Stafford Hospital. 

'Three members of staff who were on duty at the time have been suspended, while an immediate investigation is being carried out.

'Colin Ovington, Director of Nursing, along with the ward manager, met with the patient’s family as soon as we were aware of the allegation, to provide them with details of the incident and explain what actions are being undertaken.’

MP for Stafford, Jeremy Lefroy, said he was 'very disturbed' by the recent incident.

'The fact that a member of staff quickly report this appalling incident and the hospital took immediate action is an example of the culture of candour that must be upheld throughout the NHS,' he said.

'However, it is even more important that patients safety is paramount and that such things do not occur in the first place.

Mr Lefroy added: 'The standard and quality of care at Stafford Hospital has improved in recent years, but there continues to be no room for complacency as this incident clearly demonstrates.'

The health watchdog delivered a scathing verdict on standards of care earlier this month saying hospitals had made 'no improvement' since the Stafford scandal shook the NHS in 2008.

The Care Quality Commission revealed it had issued twice as many notices to hospitals for putting patients at risk than last year.

The amount of 'serious' problems - including patients going without food, being left on trolleys for hours and falling victim to severe staff shortages - has risen by fifth.

A statement accompanying the annual report said: 'In the aftermath of the failures of care at Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation trust, our inspectors’ biggest concern in 2012/13 was that acute hospitals made no improvement in assessing and monitoring the  quality of the care they provided.

‘Hospitals did not improve their assessment and monitoring of the quality of the care they provided.

'There was also no improvement in safety and safeguarding, or in treating people with dignity and respect.'

A damning 2009 Health commission report found the hospital subjected patients to poor conditions and inadequate care.

Later, a public inquiry speared by Robert Francis QC uncovered claims treatment at the hospital was so bad, patients were left lying in their own urine and became so thirsty they were forced to drink water from flower vases.
