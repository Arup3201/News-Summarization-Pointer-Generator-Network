A man uses Skype on an iPad: A security flaw has
been revealed that allows hackers to seize control of accounts using their 
victim's email address

Skype was today forced to pull its password reset function after a vulnerability was revealed that allowed hackers to hijack accounts using just their victim's email address.

The security flaw allowed an attacker to reset the password of any Skype users, locking victims out of their own accounts and giving the hacker total control.

To exploit the vulnerability, all attackers needed to know was the email address tied to their victim's Skype account to persuade the Microsoft-owned service to provide a password reset token to given them access.

The hack was first reveal on a Russian-language forum two months ago, The Next Web reported. A reporter for the tech site confirmed that the exploit was possible.

'We reproduced the attack, step-by-step, and managed to access the Skype accounts of TNW writer (with permission) Josh Ong (as well as editor Matt Brian to verify again) with only their email addresses,' Emil Protalinski wrote.

'Essentially, that email address is used to create a new account with your own email address tied to it.

'Then, minus a couple of key steps, you can use a password reset token to gain access to your target’s account.'

The site's investigation showed that the hack then gave access to a victim's Skype account, revealing the target's username and allowing the attacker to change the password.

Once the password was changed, the hacker gained exclusive access to the account, with the victim no longer able to log in.

The Next Web explained that the hack 
works because Skype sends password reminders to both the account 
holder's email address and, crucially, the Skype app itself.

This allows a third-party to intercept the token, redeem it and claim ownership of the victim's original username and account.

Embarrassment: Skype has now disabled its password reset page until the flaw can be fixed

The security exploit is an embarrassment for Microsoft, last week announced it was shutting down its Live Messenger service and forcing users to migrate to SKype, which it bought last year in a massive $8.5billion takeover.

Once alerted to the vulnerability, Skype moved quickly to disable its password reset page.

Skype spokesman Leonas Sendrauskas told MailOnline: 'Early this morning we were notified of user concerns surrounding the security of the password reset feature on our website. This issue affected some users where multiple Skype accounts were registered to the same email address.

'We suspended the password reset feature temporarily this morning as a precaution and have made updates to the password reset process today so that it is now working properly.

'We are reaching out to a small number of users who may have been impacted to assist as necessary.

'Skype is committed to providing a safe and secure communications experience to our users and we apologise for the inconvenience.
