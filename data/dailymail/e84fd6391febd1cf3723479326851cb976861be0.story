A defiant mother of five who was viciously mocked on a beach because of her stretch marks has hit back by posting a picture of her sunbathing on Facebook along with an open letter to the group who abused her.

Tanis Jex-Blake, of Alberta, said the group started 'pointing, laughing and pretending to kick me' as she attempted to sunbathe in public in a bikini for the first time since giving birth to her first child 13 years ago.

The 33-year-old has now received messages of support from across the world after the post was shared widely on the social media site.

Mother-of-five Tanis Jex-Blake posted this picture to Facebook along with an open letter to a group who abused her while she attempted to sunbathe on Alberta Beach

In the post she wrote: 'I'm sorry if my first attempt at sun tanning in a bikini in public in 13 years "grossed you out". 

'I'm sorry that my stomach isn't flat and tight. I'm sorry that my belly is covered in stretch marks. 

'I'm NOT sorry that my body has housed, grown, protected, birthed and nurtured FIVE fabulous, healthy, intelligent and wonderful human beings.'

In the post, she goes on to say: 'I'm sorry if my 33 year old, 125 lb body offended you so much that you felt that pointing, laughing, and pretending to kick me. 

'But I'll have you know that as I looked at your "perfect" young bodies, I could only think to myself "what great and amazing feat has YOUR body done?". 

'I'll also have you know that I held my head high, unflinching as you mocked me, pretending that what you said and did had no effect on me; but I cried in the car on the drive home.'

Mrs Jex-Blake said the group started 'pointing, laughing and pretending to kick me' as she attempted to sunbathe in public in a bikini for the first time since giving birth to her first child 13 years ago

The letter has now received hundreds of messages of support after local radio station Hot 107 Edmonton shared the post on itsFacebook page. 

One Facebook user wrote: 'My wife has four kids... and we call her stretch marks "love stories". It's beautiful! Real men appreciate those stretch marks'.

Another wrote: 'What is wrong with people now a days? Seriously! And what are parents teaching their children that they feel it is ok to treat others like this. 

'Tanis there is nothing wrong with your body it's beautiful and yes you went through the miracle of child birth and those are your your medals for doing it.'

Mrs Jex-Blake told Global News: 'Initially I posted it with the hopes of word reaching them… but now it’s gone so much further.'
