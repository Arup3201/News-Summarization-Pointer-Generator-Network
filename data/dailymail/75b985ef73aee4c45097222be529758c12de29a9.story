A Chinese woman has kept her mentally ill son chained in a room for the past 21 years.

Hong Chunlin, 37, spends most of his time shackled by his wrist and lying in bed in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, in eastern China.

He is cared for by his 71-year-old mother Chen Jiufang, who resorted to the drastic measure after he became violent.

Hong's right wrist has deep scars due to being chained for so long.

His mother believes his mental health problems were triggered when he was 16.

She said her son started to suffer from violent, psychotic episodes after a bout of severe depression when a teenage romance fizzled out.

Mrs Jiufang said: 'He [used] to go out and have a fight with others and I stopped him and kept him in the house.'

His family say he reacts 
aggressively whenever he sees the colour red, because his former girlfriend
was wearing a red dress when she ended their relationship.

'We
are ordinary farmers and we can't afford psychiatric hospitals or even 
the drugs the doctors say might control his behaviour,' his mother explained.

'All I can do is 
keep him clean, safe and well fed.

'Seeing him in chains breaks my heart, but if we didn't lock him up he would hurt us or himself. He can be quite violent.

'I
would dearly love him to become well again, but we have no money and 
need some sort of benefactor to come forward and save him.'

Speaking about Hong before he was locked up, a neighbour said: 'He was very aggressive and often chased and beat villagers, especially women who dressed in red clothes.'
