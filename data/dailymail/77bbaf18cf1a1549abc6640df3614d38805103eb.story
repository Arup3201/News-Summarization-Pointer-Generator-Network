Dairylea cheese triangles: Alexei Sayle admitted he has 'not lived a pure life untainted by capitalism'

He's one of the leading left-wing comedians of his generation who has railed against capitalism.

But socialist Alexei Sayle admitted he damaged his artistic integrity by accepting a pay cheque to record adverts for Dairylea cheese triangles.

The comedian - raised as a Marxist by working-class parents in Liverpool - has also done voiceovers for Kinder chocolates and the Hendy Van and Truck Centre.

Sayle said he feels guilty for accepting the lucrative offers - but the pull of a large payout was too much to resist.

The 60-year-old, who is doing a stand-up show at the Edinburgh Fringe for the first time in 17 years, is famed for his anti-capitalist rants.

He told The Times: 'I say "Don't trust anything I say." My views should be looked at with great critical distance.

'I've not lived a pure life untainted by capitalism. I always said that I wouldn't appear in a TV ad, but I'm not an exemplar.'

Sayle, who now lives in an affluent area of north London famed for its left-wing intellectuals, shot to fame in the 1980s as one of the founding fathers of alternative comedy.

Comedians and actors can be paid in excess of £60,000 a year to do voiceover work for well-known brands.

The pay cheques provide an alluring 
income boost for celebrities - although some of the biggest names also 
appear in commercials.

Kate Winslet was in an American 
Express advert in 2005, while Brad Pitt has recently appeared in a 
Chanel perfume Number 5 advert.

Benedict Cumberbatch has appeared in adverts for Jaguar cars and has also promoted pedigree dog food.

He retired from stand-up in 1995 but is now returning.

Steven Berkoff, the veteran actor and director, who has done adverts for McDonalds and Tropicana juices, said he is not embarrassed to have been paid for lending his voice to commercials.

'Every actor has their own measure of conscience, and I don't think many actors suffer pangs about doing voiceovers because it supplements their income,' he told The Times.

However, he accused big name film actors of 'demeaning' themselves by appearing in television commercials.
