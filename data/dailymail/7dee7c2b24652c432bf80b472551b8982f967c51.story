A Welsh woman was convicted yesterday of racially abusing her father's mistress by calling her an 'English cow'.

Prestatyn magistrates heard that Elen Humphreys, 25, went to Angela Payne's house in Rhyl to collect some of her father's belongings and told her: 'Leave well alone, you English cow'.

Ms Payne reported Humphreys to police, saying the comments were the 'final straw'.

Humphreys was ordered to pay Ms Payne £50 in compensation and was given a 12-month conditional discharge after pleading guilty to racially aggravated harassment at court.

The case comes two days after a English tourist Anthony Taaffe was fined £150 for calling security staff at a Welsh holiday park 'a bunch of sheep s******s'.

Prosecutor James Neary said Ms Payne contacted police last November because Humphreys' mother had previously been warned by officers about her conduct.

He added that Humphreys, of Garndolbenmaen, near
Porthmadog, had called Ms Payne other names before the incident.

Andrew Hutchinson, defending, said 
that Humphreys’s parents had been married for 32 years but her father 
had then started the other relationship and gone 'backwards and forwards' 
between the two women.

'Emotions were running high,' he said.

Last week, Taaffe, from Bolton, received the fine after calling security staff and an off-duty policeman at a holiday part near Prestatyn a 'bunch of sheep s******s'.

Taaffe claimed at court in Llandudno, North Wales, he was using the term to describe ‘people living in the countryside’.

The court was told that on Thursday 
last week Taaffe appeared drunk and had been shouting and swearing at 
staff at Presthaven Sands holiday park at Gronant, near Prestatyn.
