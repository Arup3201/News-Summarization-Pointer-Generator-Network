Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are carrying out DNA tests on scraps of clothing they found in a hidden pit just feet from where she vanished, it has been claimed.

Forensic experts drafted in from the UK are said to be carrying out analysis of the 'non-organic' material, which was found near a hole in the ground on wasteland in Portugal's Praia de Luz resort.

The find comes as officers said they need they need at least another week to search the strip of wasteland, which is just 1,000 feet from the Ocean Club complex from which Madeleine went missing on the evening of Thursday May 3, 2007.

Investigation: The scraps of clothing are understood to have been found inside this concealed hole, which police officers found covered by corrugated iron. The items have now been sent for forensic analysis

Discovery: The hole has been been subject to intense police investigation since it was discovered on Wednesday. It is believed to have been used by children playing in the area for years

New phase: British police yesterday began inspecting sewers under wasteland minutes from where Madeleine was last seen as their Portuguese counterparts watch on

Manhole covers were lifted and cameras dropped down to survey the complex network of pipes

The hidden pit is on the southern tip 
of the area British police have been given permission to search, 
according to the Daily Mirror.

It is said to have previously been used by local children as a play area.

Referring
 to the discovering of scraps of clothing, the newspaper quoted a source
 as saying: 'It could be days before the significance of the items is 
known... Several [items] are being analysed by the British team.'

Scotland Yard has refused to provide 
‘a running commentary’ on whether any leads have so far been found.

Yesterday
 British detectives working in the Algarve resort pulled up manhole 
covers and began analysing the network of sewer pipes using micro 
cameras and fibre-optic cables.

They
 have yet to say whether they have found anything significant, but 
Madeleine's parents - Kate and Gerry McCann - said they were 'encouraged
 by the progress' of the search.

The area British police have been given permission to search is not far from the apartment where the McCanns were staying. It is understood to have previously been used by local children as a play area

Experienced: Seven-year-old English springer spaniels 'Tito and Muzzy' from South Wales Police, who helped hunt for April Jones, were back on the land for a fourth day

Hot work: The dogs were covered in water and a wet blanket as their handlers ensure they did not overheat in the Algarve sun

The sewer system being searched was installed as part of failed plans 
to build a hotel on the site before Madeleine disappeared in 2007, but after a planning battle it remained wasteland.

The
 search of the area for clues to what happened to the three-year-old 
from Leicestershire is expected to go into a second week after British 
police were granted an extra seven days by the Portuguese authorities to
 keep searching.

Sources said detectives had not realised just how hard and dry the land would be where they have been digging for clues.

The
 extension may also have been granted after surprise finds at the first 
site, where a large concealed shaft was discovered by sniffer dogs.

Officers also believed they had come 
across a burial site late on Wednesday but this has since reportedly 
been ruled out as an area of interest.

Bones were discovered on the
 site but tests showed they were from cows and pigs.

Forensic approach: Police have split the wasteland into at least 12 areas of interest, using dogs, scanning equipment and fingertip searches

Vantage point: At the centre of the search site is a hill, where officers on horses and also with telescopes are taking advantage of the height to look for evidence

However, Mr and Mrs McCann yesterday 
wrote online to well-wishers saying they are 'encouraged by the 
progress'‎ of searches for their missing daughter.

‎Writing
 on the couple's official Find Madeleine Facebook page, Kate and Gerry 
McCann said: 'We are kept updated on the on-going work in Portugal and 
are encouraged by the progress.

'Thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get Madeleine home.'‎

Mr
 and Mrs McCann, who have not travelled to Praia da Luz, were previously
 said to have been bracing themselves for 'significant news'.

Meanwhile sniffer dogs used to hunt for murdered schoolgirl April Jones were again on the site hunting for evidence.

The seven-year-old English springer spaniels – Tito and Muzzy – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time.

On Wednesday they uncovered 
 concealed shaft covered with corrugated iron, yards from the spot where
 Madeleine McCann vanished. Scotland Yard moved in to seal off the area 
with large white tents.

This shaft is understood to be the area where the 'non organic' material was discovered.

Investigation: Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and 45-year-old Gerry McCann have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed and are said to expect 'significant news' on their daughter

Five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence.

The shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was 
covered with wooden planks, a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of 
earth.

A
 local source said: ‘The discovery of the hole came as a surprise. 
Police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay 
things.’

The
 area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at
 least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine.

It was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen 
walking in the direction of the site on the night that Madeleine was 
last seen alive.
