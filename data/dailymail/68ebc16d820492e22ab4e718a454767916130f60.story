A couple who escaped a fire earlier this week with nothing except the clothes on their backs have married outside their ruined home after firemen rescued their engagement ring from the ashes.

With no dress, no flowers, and watched by only a small crowd of family and friends, Brian Osborne, 34, wed fiancee Megan Hunley today on the front lawn of their scorched house in Ledyard, Conn.

The couple were forced to flee the burning building only last Monday, leaving everything behind, including an engagement ring Brian had been planning to give to Megan.

A couple who fled a house fire with nothing but the clothes on their backs a week ago have married outside their burned house after firemen found their engagement ring in the ashes

Brain Osborne had been planning to propose to girlfriend Megan Hunley, and had the ring hidden in their bedroom, but was forced to flee without it when the fire started

Brian thought the ring had been burned with the rest of his possessions, but after the blaze was put out he asked a firefighter to go back in and look for it just in case.

In an upstairs bedroom, underneath a pile of rubble, the fireman found a charred box and when he opened it, saw that the ring had escaped unharmed.

He carried it back outside to Brian who proposed on the spot, and now, just over a week later, the couple are happily married.

Wearing nothing but the clothes they escaped the blaze in, Megan and Brian married, and say they want the occasion to act as a reminder that all they need is each other.

Speaking to WSFB, Megan said: 'I wouldn't want it any other way. All that other stuff is materialistic. I don't think we ever imagined this, I don't think anyone ever does.'

After the blaze was extinguished Brian asked a firefighter to go back in and look for the ring, and to his amazement, the man found it unharmed in the bedroom

When the fireman brought the ring back out Brian proposed on the spot, and the couple married outside the house as a reminder that all they need is each other

Referring to the moment the ring emerged from the fire, she added: 'I cried. It was just an amazing moment because you think, why, of everything, why did this make it?'

The couple were joined on their front lawn by 40 guests, including Osborneâ€™s two children who were also in the house at the time of the blaze, but managed to escape unharmed.

Several members of the Gales Ferry Volunteer Fire Company were also invited.

Brain said: 'It's a great way to start over. It's all symbolic, we look at everything we've been through and think, why waste it, you never know what's next.'
