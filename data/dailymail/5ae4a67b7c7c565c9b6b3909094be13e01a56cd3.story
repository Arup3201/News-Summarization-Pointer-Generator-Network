Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills today won a silver medal for skiing in a New Zealand Winter Games slalom event.

The former model, who lost her leg below the knee in a road accident 20 years ago, was taking part in the adaptive slalom event.

She is ranked number 28 in the world but won the silver medal after recording a time of 2 minutes 9.09 seconds at Coronet Peak in Queenstown.

Miss Mills, 45, married Beatles star Sir Paul but they separated four years later and divorced after a protracted battle through the courts.

She demanded a payout of £125million from her estranged husband but was eventually awarded £24.3million by the High Court.

Miss Mills is hoping to compete in the Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi next February.
