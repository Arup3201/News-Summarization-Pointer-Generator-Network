Four people are dead and four more are injured after a van believed to be part of a human smuggling ring rolled over Friday on a Utah highway.

Multiple people were ejected from the 1999 Toyota Sienna in the 4.30 a.m. accident about 35 miles from the Colorado border, police said. A woman who survived the smash up is believed to have fled the scene.

The vehicle ‘lost control, rolled multiple times down the middle of the interstate, ejecting multiple occupants,’ Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Todd Royce told the Deseret News.

The four dead were men, as were the four injured. They were transported by ambulance to a hospital just over the state line.

The accident victims are all Hispanic, which has led authorities to consider the possibility human trafficking may be involved.

‘We're looking at this as possibly being a human smuggling case,’ Royce told the paper.

It is not known what caused the maroon van to roll, he added, declining to say which state its license plates are from.

Also not known is the condition or whereabouts of the female passenger.

‘One concern is the medical well-being of that person,’ said Royce. ‘If they walked away and haven't been checked out by medical, that's a concern of ours.’ 

Investigators consider the missing witness a ‘vital piece to this puzzle,’ he insisted.

The Utah Highway Patrol has been joined in the investigation by the state Bureau of Investigations, Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement.

The highway was reopened in time for the morning rush hour.
