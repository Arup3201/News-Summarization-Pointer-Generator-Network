There have been a handful of pioneering women who have transformed our quality of life. Marie Curie. Marie Stopes. Emily Wilding Davison. Helen Gurley Brown. Margaret Thatcher.

Today, to this venerable list, we can add the name Belinda Earl, style supremo at Marks & Spencer, whose no-nonsense attitude is about to ensure women will be able to wave at a friend, hail a taxi and enthusiastically applaud a win at the tennis without looking round furtively, then performing said action with elbows firmly planted in ribs, like a trussed chicken.

Because, earlier this week at the M&S annual general meeting Ms Earl confirmed to shareholders that from now on 90 per cent of her dresses would have sleeves: real sleeves, extending to our elbows and wrists.

Sleeves to love: The Per Una scarlet lace applique dress is £119, but the white wool coat (right) is a pricey £349

Like flapper girls discarding their corsets, women in the auditorium breathed a big sigh of relief. They’d have clapped - if they could.

Ms Earl hopes these sleeves will lure back female shoppers to the store, which this week saw clothing sales fall again (by 1.6 per cent, a slight improvement on the previous quarter).

I’d like to take a small amount of credit for the reintroduction of sleeves. I have long campaigned for their comeback, and raised the issue when I met the new style director to preview her autumn collection in April.

You might think that I’m over-egging Ms Earl’s contribution to female well-being and emancipation, given she has merely made the decision to add sleeves to M&S’s new autumn/winter collection, which will filter into shops over the next few weeks.

Sleeves are being revived by Marks and Spencer for its dresses after customers put pressure on the company

New lines: This Autograph dress is £69

But all women over 16 know exactly how
much your upper arms feature in your choice of activities, hobbies, 
holidays and level of enthusiasm for everyday life.

Ah, you might say, but don’t women 
worry about their buttocks, their tummies and their breasts, too? Yes, 
but on the whole, unless you are Rihanna, these parts of your anatomy 
can remain largely covered and hoiked and helped, a truism supported by 
the fact that bestsellers at M&S remain thigh smoothers, push-up 
bras, tummy controllers and even jeans that scoop your buttocks up.

Perversely, the fashion of late is for
our arms to be completely unfettered: never mind the ubiquitous 
spaghetti strap, the fashion industry these days even makes sleeveless 
coats and jackets. I have no idea why they do this. Perhaps it is 
because they haven’t fully appreciated how devilishly hard it is  to 
tone the hammocky tricep muscle - otherwise known as the bingo wing.

High street fashion: Models pose in new collection for Marks and Spencer at their annual AGM

Even superfit, muscle-bound, 
powerhouse Serena Williams experienced a bit of arm flap during 
Wimbledon. Never mind her defeat, my heart went out to her for her upper
arms. ‘Hold that serve Serena,’ I wanted to yell. ‘Have a long-sleeved 
T-shirt!’

Why no High Street brand has taken 
M&S’s new stance is baffling. Brands like Jaeger, supposedly on the 
side of the older woman, sell us sparkly wraps and shrugs and boleros, 
which make us fiddle self-consciously all evening.

Another supposed champion of the 
over-40s woman is Mary Portas. Her sole contribution to the great arm 
cover-up been a weird garment called the Armery: a pair of tights you 
wear on your arms. Just go the whole hog and wear tights over your head.

After all, wearing tights on your arms
is a bit like a post-menopausal woman going out to dinner carrying a 
shaving mug and Bic razor. It screams middle-age, and we don’t want to 
advertise our flaws.

Saviour: Liz is delighted style director Belinda Earl has listened to what women want

When I previewed Belinda Earl’s 
autumn/winter collection I was so relieved at the re-emergence of the 
sleeve I would have hugged her, had I not been afraid of squashing my 
bare, flabby, cellulite-ridden upper arms against her torso. Such was my
excitement that she then and there promised to add sleeves to 80  per 
cent of M&S’s garments - and at the AGM on Tuesday she had added 10 
per cent to the figure she gave me in the spring.

I can hear some of you worrying: ‘Aren’t all these long sleeves terribly mumsy and frumpy?’

Not if you follow certain rules. Earl 
has grasped this beautifully. The first rule is to avoid a sleeve that’s
baggy and flaps. It must be narrow and fitted, in a fabric with a hint 
of stretch. Earl’s sleeves are most often three-quarter-length, reaching
just above the elbow, to avoid constriction and creasing. They come in 
lace, or a contrasting sheer fabric, for a feeling of nakedness and 
airiness, which we’re all used to.

Pret-a-porter: Liz was given a sneak peek at M&S' new range in May and was glad to see more sleeves

Next month sees the arrival of a black
cocktail dress with sheer narrow sleeves; decorated with ribbon blooms,
and a stretchy nude lining.

At £75, it’s great value for a 100 per
cent silk dress. In September, a white waffle dress with three- 
quarter-length sleeves will hit the rails, £79: perfect for the office, 
or dinner. So, top marks to Belinda for resurrecting the sleeve. 
Nakedness, especially in a hot spell, isn’t the coolest option, and a 
moist, stubbly underarm will never pass muster in the boardroom or 
anywhere else.

But I still think Earl needs to be 
more radical before M&S is back to its best. When she told me in our
interview that she was cutting product lines by 50 per cent, I cheered.

But later I realised I had misheard 
her and she had said 15 per cent. M&S still carried far too much 
choice, and too many sub-brands, particularly Per Una and Indigo. The 
slight improvement in sales should be taken with a pinch of M&S sea 
salt: her very first garment doesn’t go on sale until July 25.

Let’s wait till Christmas before 
pronouncing the new, more expensive direction she is taking as a huge 
mistake (who will pay £349 for an M&S coat, even if it is 100 per 
cent wool and British-made).

But for now, let us be happy. Belinda Earl is waving the flag for grown-up women, with not a bingo wing in sight.

Now, if only she would just jettison those ghastly waterfall cardigans...
