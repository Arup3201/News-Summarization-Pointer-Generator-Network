Breach: Ruby Cooper, 52, has been found guilty of breaching her restraining order for the second time in a 21-year campaign against NatWest and its parent company RBS

A former bank manager who warned the RBS chairman 'not to go home this weekend' unless she was paid £750,000 has been remanded in a mental hospital.

Ruby Cooper, 52, bombarded Sir Philip Hampton with emails and phone calls and threatened to stab a member of staff if she didn't receive her money.

It came just months after the former NatWest worker was found guilty of harassing RBS chief executive Stephen Hester and sending him a vial of liquid she claimed to be poison.

Cooper, who has led a 20-year campaign against NatWest and its parent group RBS, initially escaped prison last October with a restraining order banning her from contacting any RBS workers.

But a week later she turned to Sir Philip with her demands, and in February she was remanded in custody where she has stayed until now.

Today, a jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London found Cooper guilty of breaching her restraining order.

Adjourning sentencing until July 18, Judge Martin Zeidman ordered for Cooper to undergo a psychiatric examination and remain in a hospital until sentencing.

Mr Zeidman said: ‘The sad thing is that 
this defendant has been in custody for some six months and that is 
because having made a restraining order, we need to know she won't do it
 again.

‘All I want to hear is that she won’t do it again but you can see by the previous convictions that she is likely to.

‘I must order a formal psychiatric report while you are in custody though you will remain at the hospital.’

As
 she was led away from the dock, Cooper turned to the judge and 
exclaimed: ‘Thanks for putting me in a mental hospital which I will not 
get out of for the rest of my life.

‘This is not justice.’

She also expressed concern for her two dogs, claiming: ‘I need to get out for my dogs, I have two bulldogs.’

Cooper's campaign against the bank began in 1993 when a member of NatWest's call centre staff allegedly took her home address from the bank's computers and paid her repeated visits even after she moved home.

'Freaked out', she repeatedly contacted the bank about her concerns until she was convicted of harassing former chairman Sir David Rowland in 2000.

She was then banned from contacting any employees of NatWest or RBS, or any police officers involved in her case.

Undeterred, Cooper sent two emails to chief executive Stephen Hester threatening to 
‘flush him out’ and release the address of his children days after
 sending him a vial of liquid purporting to be poison.

Last October, the restraining order was renewed.

Targeted: Cooper warned RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton 'not to go home' and that a member of staff would be stabbed. Her threats came a year after she sent chief executive Stephen Hester a vial of so-called poison

But she then began bombarding chairman Sir Philip Hampton with emails and phone calls before getting RBS chief executive officer Ross McEwan and police chief Bernard Hogan-Howe involved.

On January 17, when the messages became abusive, staff called the police.

She told Sir Philip’s personal assistants that a member of staff was going to be stabbed if she didn’t get her money, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Warning banking bosses to stop being ‘low-life, thieving scum’, she  and just to give her the money she believed she was owed.

She also told Mr McEwan that the company could have a ‘corporate manslaughter’ on their hands if she decided to ‘flip.’

RBS staff told Cooper she 
was in breach of her restraining order but things came to a head in 
January when the messages became abusive.

'Stop acting like low-life thieving scum - if 
you pay yourself such big bonuses then you can pay mine by next week'

- One of Ruby Cooper's emails to Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive officer

Cooper also sent an email to police 
commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe claiming she was told to email Mr 
McEwan. She said: ‘I have been asked now to send all my emails to Ross 
McEwan by RBS themselves just in case they try and stitch me up.’

In
 a second email sent to Mr McEwan and Mr Hogan-Howe later on 15 January 
she said: ‘Your secretaries both tell me that Mr McEwan has taken over 
my case and to speak to me on the telephone.

‘Please
 ensure my cheque arrives by 17 January and please do not put me through
 any more stress as you have destroyed 19 years of my life.

‘You have cost me £2 million but I am willing to accept just £750,000 by next week.

‘If
 you continue to harass me and I flip and you end up with a corporate 
manslaughter situation then you will have only Natwest and RBS to 
blame.’

On January 16 she emailed the bank 
asking for her cheque to be sent by courier before informing Mr McEwan 
personally that all the proof he needed to clear the cheque could be 
found on her website natweststalker.com.

She
 continued in her email: ‘Stop acting like low-life thieving scum - if 
you pay yourself such big bonuses then you can pay mine by next week.

Campaign: Cooper, who worked for NatWest - now owned by RBS - from 1977-78, has run a 21-year campaign against the banks claiming a worker took her home address from the firm's database and visited her house

Further targets: She also emailed RBS chief executive officer Ross McEwan (left) after her conviction last October, and then emailed Metropolitan Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) to say she had been told to

‘Do not hold me responsible for retaliation.’

Privately-educated
 Cooper, who has a degree in psychology and social anthropology from the
 University of Stirling, worked for NatWest from 1977-78.

Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said: ‘She was prohibited from contacting any member of staff at RBS.

‘The
 trouble is she did it again and again and again and suggests she didn’t
 contact anyone at RBS because she had emailed people from Natwest.

‘But her own emails and phone calls show this is rubbish.

‘In
 one call to Fiona Macdonald, she will tell you Cooper said “We have 
been warned and she was going to stab a member of staff if they did not 
send her the cheque.”

‘In a 
second call, which may have been hot air, she said “Sir Philip Hampton 
should not stay in his house this weekend as things will be happening to
 him.”

‘That is a pretty unpleasant thing to say.’
