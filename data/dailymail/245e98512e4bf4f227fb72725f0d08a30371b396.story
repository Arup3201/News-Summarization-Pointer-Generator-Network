Stay optimistic: David Cameron will be told to resist copying Ukip, in light of a Conservative triumph in the Newark by-election

David Cameron will today be told to stick to an ‘optimistic’ message and resist becoming ‘Ukip-lite’ after his party successfully defended a by-election seat for the first time in 25 years.

Conservative candidate Robert Jenrick held off the threat of a Ukip ‘earthquake’, winning Newark with a reduced majority of 7,403.

It was the first time the Tories have successfully defended a seat in a by-election since William Hague won in Richmond, Yorkshire, in 1989.

Ukip’s candidate Roger Helmer surged from a distant fourth in 2010 to second, but with 25 per cent of the vote he failed in his party’s aim of reaching 30 per cent.

Mr Helmer admitted yesterday that the failure of ‘box office’ party leader Nigel Farage to campaign hard in the Nottinghamshire constituency may have impacted on the result – less than a fortnight after Ukip topped the European elections poll.

Today a senior Tory minister will claim the campaign tactic of concentrating on the ‘long-term economic plan’ had been the right one.

In a speech entitled Reasons to be Cheerful, Home Office minister Damian Green will say: ‘What Newark tells us is that the temptation to become Ukip-lite should be firmly resisted.

'The political battle of our times is between optimists and pessimists. Conservatives should be optimists believing that free markets and a strong society are the basis for a successful country in this century.’

Ukip’s rise in support pushed Labour into third place, while Lib Dem support was obliterated – leaving their candidate trailing in sixth place. Ed Miliband’s party saw its vote share fall – a disappointing result less than a year from  a general election in a constituency the party won during Tony Blair’s first landslide  in 1997.

In a sign of the depth of concern in the Tory camp over the possibility of losing, the Prime Minister hit the campaign trail in Newark four times.

Mr Farage accused the Tories of running a ‘nasty’ campaign, but insisted his party had still achieved one of its best by-election results.

Nigel Farage’s lack of appeal to female voters helped the Tories win in Newark, a survey found.

A
 poll before the election showed the parties neck-and-neck among men 
while nearly three times as many women would vote Tory compared to Ukip.

It found 36.8 per cent of men planned to vote for Ukip’s Roger Helmer, with 36.2 per cent backing Tory Robert Jenrick.

But only 16.8 per cent of women backed Ukip, against 47.6 per cent intending to vote Tory.

‘I think there’ll be an awful lot of Conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror,’ he said. ‘For Ukip, it’s still a good night’s work.’

Experts said that Newark – together with the recent local and European elections – provided no evidence that Labour was on track to win an overall majority next May.

John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Labour do not have the enthusiasm and depth of support in the electorate that make them look like an alternative government.

'It is not the sign of a party making progress, but a party which seems to be in retreat, and now retreating so far that if it goes any further there will be question marks about its ability to win the next election.’

Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems garnered just 1,004 votes and 2.6 per cent of the vote – bad enough for it to lose its deposit for the ninth by-election since joining the Coalition.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We need to work between now and the election to say very clearly we have got a long-term plan, we are getting Britain back to work, we are cutting people’s taxes, we are helping hard-working people. The job isn’t finished yet but we are on the right track, let’s stick at it.’

As his party suffered in Newark, Mr Clegg looked like he hadn't a care in the world as he fooled around for the cameras at a book launch for Lord Ashdown.
