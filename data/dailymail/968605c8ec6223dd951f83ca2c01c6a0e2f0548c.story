The grandmother of a 10-year-old girl who was found stuffed into a garbage can had an emotional breakdown at the funeral.

Robin Moss, the grandmother of Emani Moss, was seen crying as she left the church where Emani's funeral was held in Lawrenceville, Georgia on Wednesday.

Emani's father, Eman Moss, and step-mother, Tiffany Moss, have been arrested and charged with murder, concealing a body, and child cruelty after police say they had starved to death their daughter and then set her body on fire to cover up the crime.

The District Attorney announced that he may seek the death penalty for the parents after a detective testified at their probable cause hearing that the 10-year-old girl was starved to death and burned in a trash can.

Detective Collin Flynn said that Mr 
Moss had initially told police last Saturday that Emani died after 
swallowing some chemicals.

The man later changed his story, accusing his wife of poisoning the 10-year-old.

Eman
Moss eventually admitted that he returned home from work October 24 to 
find little Emani lying in the bathtub and unable to move.

Neither
he nor Tiffany Moss, however, sought medical attention for the girl 
because they were afraid they would get in trouble with the law, Flynn 
said. 

Eman Moss eventually admitted that he returned home from work October 24 to find little Emani lying in the bathtub and unable to move.

Neither he nor Tiffany Moss, however, sought medical attention for the girl because they were afraid they would get in trouble with the law, Flynn said. 

'My baby went through hell,' her paternal grandmother Robin Moss told The Atlanta Journal Constitution earlier in the investigation.

According to the woman, after Emani had confided in her that she was being abused by her parents- her son and his wife- but they kept the 10-year-old away from her.

'I'm guilty, I killed my baby,' Eman Moss told police, according to the detective’s testimony cited by the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

According
to a report from Georgia’s child services agency, Eman Moss bought a 
trash can and tried to incinerate his daughter's body in it. When the 
girl's remains would not burn, he took Emani back home and called police
on November 2.

It has 
emerged earlier this week that Georgia's child protection agency had 
dismissed a report that Emani Moss had been beaten with a belt.

The
Division of Family and Children Services did not send caseworkers to 
interview the girl, examine her injuries or question her parents.

Confession: Gwinnett County Police Detective Collin Flynn testified that Mr Moss had admitted to killing his child

Agency officials concluded the beatings were corporal punishment and ended the case despite four prior maltreatment investigations involving the child.

The agency first made contact with the Moss family in 2003 when Emani was only one year old, the station 11Alive reported.

Caseworkers were told that the baby was not being properly cared for and denied food, but the officials ruled the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and closed the matter.

Two years later, in April 2005, the agency investigated claims that the 3-year-old girl was suffering emotional and psychological neglect, but these allegations were also dismissed as ‘unsubstantiated.'

In December 2008, the DFCS got a tip asking to look into claims of inadequate medical care and possible sexual abuse. 

Caseworks met with the child in private and concluded that 'no concerns were noted' about her.

In
March 2010, the child services agency confirmed that Emani had been 
whipped with a belt for failing to finish her schoolwork or get good 
grades.

Emani's parents
were ordered to take parenting classes and go through an anger 
management course. Three months later, the child was returned to the 
home and the case was closed six months after that.

History of abuse: Tiffany Moss allegedly whipped Emani with a belt for failing to do her homework or get good grades

Isolated: Police say her parents kept little Emani away from people outside of the immediate family and did not let her attend school

Last May, officials at Emani's grade school reported seeing welts on her back and marks on her head, which were determined to be the results of corporal punishment.

The last contact between DFCS and the Moss family came three months before Emani's death, when the agency got an anonymous tip that Emani appeared 'distant and afraid to interact’ with others.

However, DFCS closed the case after failing to find the parents’ address.

Police reports released since last Saturday indicate that the 10-year-old tried to run away from home and showed up at school with bruises and welts.

‘Detectives believe the victim was isolated from people outside of her family in the weeks before her death,’ said Gwinnett police spokesman Cpl. Jake Smith. ‘She did not attend school outside the home during this school year.’

Robin Moss’ attorney said the woman tried to get child services to open an investigation into allegations of abuse, but no action had been taken.

Inconsolable: Robin Moss, Emani's paternal grandmother, said she had fought to win custody of the 10-year-old and asked child services officials to investigate possible abuse, but no action was taken

Miss Moss also said she had fought to win custody of her granddaughter, but the state would not let her have Emani.

‘I don't understand how the system kept putting her back in that home,’ Moss said.

The bereaved grandmother explained that she helped raise Emani from the time she was 4 years old, and the two had developed a strong bond.

In an interview with WSBTV, Robin Moss said that since her granddaughter’s death, she cannot sleep because she can 'see her hurt.'

Division of Family and Children Services officials released a statement Tuesday announcing that it will look into the way the agency handled Emani’s case.

Special bond: Robin Moss said she helped raise Emani from the time she was 4 years old, and the two had a relationship akin to that of a mother and daughter

Horrific: Police found the body inside this trash can and said that there was evidence that it had been burned

Authorities conducted an autopsy on 
Emani Sunday and determined that her body was burned after she was 
dead, likely in an effort to conceal the crime, said Gwinnett County 
Police Cpl. Jake Smith.

Emani
may have died as early as October 30 and was severely underweight when 
her body was found, Smith said. He said the autopsy showed the girl had 
been denied food for several days before her death. 

Both Eman Moss and his second wife have criminal histories. 

The father was arrested in 2004 on charges of battery and cruelty to children after police said he allegedly beat his first wife in front of Emani.

Tiffany
Moss told police she only hit the girl with a belt three times, the 
report said. She was arrested on a child-cruelty charge.

The
Georgia Division of Family and Children Services signed a 2010 plea 
deal ordering Tiffany Moss to serve five years of probation for beating 
Emani, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday.

In July 2012, Emani tried running away from home, the police reports show.

Emani's
mother, Danita Leaks, told Atlanta FOX affiliate WAGA-TV on Monday that
she and Eman Moss fought over custody for two to three years and she 
was unaware that her daughter was being abused.

‘If
I would have known that him and his wife were abusing my baby, I would 
not have let her stay over there,’ she told the television station.
