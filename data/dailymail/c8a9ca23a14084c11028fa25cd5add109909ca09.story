There's plenty of fish in the sea, but this one has come a very long way. 

Sustainable fishing campaigners have described the extensive international journey of a Coles crumbed dory fillet from the ocean to the supermarket shelf as 'ridiculous'.

According to the packaging, these dory fillets were caught in New Zealand, then crumbed in China and then shipped back to the south Pacific, where they were packaged in Australia.

At a rough estimate, the fish would have travelled at least 17000km - possibly more - before it finally arrived on Australian supermarket shelves.

A Coles spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the company is committed to sourcing food from Australian suppliers, including '100% of our fresh meat, 100% of fresh salmon and around 96% of fresh produce.' 

'We try to source our seafood from Australia wherever and whenever possible, however, in order to ensure that we give customers choice, we source seafood from overseas when it is not available locally,' the spokesman said. 

The fish's extravagant travel provoked intense commentary on the social media site Reddit, with some commentators asking 'WTF' and quipping: 'Fresh to you daily!', while others defended it as a common practice. 

More than 70 per cent of fish on Australian plates is imported from overseas, according to former chef Matthew Evans.

He told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday that the flathead, barramundi, Pacific dory and prawns sold to Australians are often sourced from South America or Asia. 

Greenpeace Oceans campaigner Nathaniel Pelle praised Coles for providing more information than is necessary on the packaging, but noted it had travelled absurdly far.

'The ridiculous distance this fish has travelled, and the carbon miles involved in its transportation, is another good reason to choose locally caught fish,' Mr Pelle said. 

Mr Evans said it was evidence of a strange and unsustainable food system.

'It's quite a bizarre food system we have where it's cheaper to ship things across the world and back rather than pay someone to do the work locally,' he said.
