Ed Miliband has been accused of trying to ‘airbrush out’ his party’s shameful record on the NHS in Wales after it removed all references to the health service in leaflets sent out there.

The Labour leader has claimed he will make the general election a fight about the future of the NHS but the party, which has been embarrassed by the poor-state of the Labour-run NHS in Wales, has left off any mention of health in campaign literature posted to homes there.

It comes as a poll shows Labour voters have higher levels of satisfaction with the NHS than other parties, despite Mr Miliband's dire warnings that it is in peril.

Patients in Wales are suffering lengthening delays to receive treatment and waiting time targets have not been met for more than four years.

A Labour leaflet currently being sent to constituencies across England boasts about the party’s ‘plan for the NHS’ and includes several images of nurses, doctors and hospitals.

But the version being delivered to Welsh homes has been modified so it makes no mention of the health service or Labour’s appalling record there.

The English pamphlet, which has the headline ‘Building an NHS with time to care’, has a picture on the front-page of Mr Miliband and Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham visiting a hospital.

The Labour leaflet sent to Welsh voters includes the party’s plans for immigration, but does not have a single mention of the NHS and includes none of the images of the health service

It warns ‘our NHS is at risk’ alongside details of how Labour will introduce new controls on immigration.

The version of the leaflet sent to Welsh voters also includes the party’s plans for immigration, but does not have a single mention of the NHS and includes none of the images of the health service.

Instead it talks about issues such as raising the minimum wage, freezing energy bills and introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax.

Labour’s candidates in Wales have also chosen to avoid talking about the NHS in literature sent to voters.

Constituents in Aberconwy, Cardiff Central and Cardiff North have all received letters from their local candidates setting out what they would do if elected, but none of them a single mention of the health service.

Labour's leaflet in England makes great play of his policies on the NHS

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Ed Miliband wants to airbrush out the chaos his party has caused in the Welsh health service.

‘Labour cut the NHS budget there by eight per cent and now Wales has the worst urgent ambulance response times since records began.

‘We know he wants to “weaponise” the NHS in England, but in Wales his party don’t even defend their record.

‘In England we invested in the NHS and are committed to supporting hardworking staff – while Labour turn their back on the NHS in Wales, and still haven’t learnt that patients must always come before politics.’

Mr Miliband has been accused of saying in private that he wants to ‘weaponise’ the NHS during the election campaign.

As he launched Labour’s health manifesto in Manchester earlier this week, he said: ‘The future of our NHS is at stake in this general election.’

A Wales Audit Office report this week found waiting time targets have not been met by the Labour-run government since September 2010 and performance has been getting worse.

By contrast, the NHS in England and Scotland, where Labour is not in power, is performing better against tougher targets.

According to the report, one in ten patients in Wales had to wait more than 26 weeks for treatment - the target is one in 20 - and three per cent waited more than 36 weeks in March last year.

It added that the causes for the longer waits 'boil down to the inability of NHS Wales as a whole to sustainably match the supply of healthcare with demand for services'. 

However, there has been a significant jump in satisfaction with the NHS among Labour voters in the last year.

Some 69 per cent of supporters declared themselves satisfied with the system - up 11 points on 2013 and slightly ahead of Liberal Democrat voters (up five at 68 per cent) and Tories (unchanged at 67 per cent). 

Data from the latest British Social Attitudes survey - published by The King's Fund health think tank - found dissatisfaction across the board was at its lowest ever, with only 15 per cent giving the thumbs down.

And an overall satisfaction score of 65 per cent meant this was the second best year for the NHS since 1983, topped only by 2010.
