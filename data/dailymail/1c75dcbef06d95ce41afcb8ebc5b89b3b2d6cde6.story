Sedbergh’s goal-kicking full-back Johnny McPhillips has fired the Cumbrian team to the top of the Daily Mail Schools Trophy. 

McPhillips landed a last-ditch, long-distance penalty to seal Sedbergh’s 37-34 win over arch-rivals Wellington on Tuesday at the Broadstreet club in Coventry. 

A memorable match between two of English rugby’s top school teams saw Sedbergh’ s stronger forwards keep Wellington’s speedy backs just at bay. 

Sedbergh stormed to a 37-34 win over arch-rivals Wellington on Tuesday at the Broadstreet club in Coventry 

Wellington, who had led the table previously, needed the pace of wing Sam Aspland-Robinson who contributed three tries to keep them in sight of the strong Cumbrians whose lock Alex Moon scored two tries. 

Robinson’s third try levelled the scores at 34-34 only for McPhillips, who had already landed one long-distance kick, to smartly add a second for a three-point advantage. 

Even then, in the final moments, Wellington earned a chance to level through a penalty, but they choose to kick for the corner in an attempt to score a winning try off a line-out move.

‘The boys wanted to win,’ explained Wellington coach Kevin Brennan. 

‘In hindsight maybe we should have gone for goal, but we wanted to win.’ 

Overall, Wellington accepted Sedbergh were the better team on the night, but the Trophy, organised on a merit-table basis by schoolsrugby.co.uk, is far from settled. Sedbergh, who had beaten Lancaster RGS, 38-0, last weekend, host unbeaten Kirkham GS, who are in fourth spot, on Saturday.

The northern showdown is all part of a hectic ‘Super Saturday’ which features several other heavyweight clashes. 

Wellington, who edged out Hampton last Saturday, 22-20, finish their tough week at Epsom College who are in fifth place, having won six games so far. 

Third-placed Grammar School At Leeds, who were the early pacesetters, travel to Yorkshire rivals Woodhouse Grove, last season’s champions, while an all-London clash features fifth-placed Dulwich at home to Whitgift, the only team to beat Sedbergh so far this season. 

Monmouth, who are sixth, may yet be involved in the title chase if they maintain their unbeaten run at Bromsgrove, one of the top teams in the midlands.
