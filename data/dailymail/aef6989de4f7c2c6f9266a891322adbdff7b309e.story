Home Office minister Norman Baker said legal highs had already caused too many young deaths

Legal high producers could be forced to prove their drugs are safe under a government clampdown to prevent more deaths linked to dangerous substances.

Police and ministers are constantly playing catch-up with the creators of legal highs, who tweak the chemical make-up of banned substances to get around the law.

Home Office minister Norman Baker warned that people who take legal highs cannot be sure they are safe or legal, and said they have claimed the lives of ‘far too many young people in our country’.

Suppliers get round existing drugs laws by describing their substances as ‘plant food’ or chemicals used fotr rsearch.

Ministers fear that even schoolchildren are able to legally buy legal highs which are potentially more dangerous than ecstasy.

The new review will look at how the UK's laws and enforcement against new psychoactive substances, also known as legal highs, can be improved.

Options to be considered will include widening legislation to ensure police and law enforcement agencies have better-tailored powers.

The move comes as the Government announces that two new groups of psychoactive substances - NBOMe and Benzofury - will become classified as Class A and B drugs respectively.

Mr Baker, the crime prevention minister, said: ‘The coalition Government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs, which has tragically already claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country.

‘Despite being marketed as legal 
alternatives to banned drugs, users cannot be sure of what they contain 
and the impact they will have on their health. Nor can they even be sure
that they are legal.

‘Our review will consider how current 
legislation can be better tailored to enable the police and law 
enforcement officers to combat this dangerous trade and ensure those 
involved in breaking the law are brought to justice.

‘NBOMe
and Benzofury are drugs which have caused serious harm and in some 
cases death to those who have taken them. Outlawing them is crucial in 
the battle to restrict their supply and use.’

NBOMe
and benzofuran compounds are currently under a temporary banning order,
which will become permanent when legislation is passed next year.

Jake Harris, 21, is said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night party after taking a mind-bending drug known as N-Bomb.

As
he was suffering terrifying hallucinations, Mr Harris, a leisure centre
lifeguard, was heard shouting and pleading: 'I want it to stop.'

He then broke a wine glass on a bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat open.

An inquest heard that Mr Harris and 
friend Steven Higgins, 27, had gone to a party at the luxury flat of 
Heather Turner, 28, near Manchester city centre.

The
court was told she had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to 
share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his 
friend. He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect 
before visiting the Glastonbury festival.

N-Bomb is also known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana.

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) last month recommended both substances are banned permanently.

The review will be led by the Home Office, with input from experts in law enforcement, science, health and academia and will present its findings in spring 2014.

The Home Office has also published updated guidance for local government on the different action trading standards can take against shops selling new psychoactive substances.

Ten ‘legal highs’ were identified last year for the first time in the UK by a specialist Government system that targets music festivals and tobacco shops.

A total of 27 new psychoactive substances, also known as legal highs, have now been detected by the Home Office's Forensic Early Warning System since it was set up in January 2011.

Official figures also show that the number of deaths being linked to legal highs soared by 80% last year to 52, from 29 in 2011.

Martin Barnes, chief executive of DrugScope, a charity supporting professionals working in drug and alcohol treatment, said: ‘It has been clear for some time that the law has been unable to keep pace with the chemistry when it comes to the production and supply of new drugs.

‘As DrugScope's recent Street Drug Trends Survey highlighted, in some areas so-called 'legal highs' are not only being sold online and in 'headshops', but in outlets such as newsagents, petrol stations and take-away food shops.

‘This is an attempt by the Home Office to bolster current enforcement efforts and to see what other legislative options could be brought to bear on this new and complex drug situation.

‘However, it is important to remember that the law by itself cannot bring this trade under control.

‘It is vital that education and information efforts are significantly enhanced in order to make the public - especially young people - more aware of the risks posed by experimenting with substances of unknown content and origin. These substances are not labelled 'research chemicals' by sellers for nothing.’

Shadow crime and security minister Diana Johnson said: ‘The Home Secretary came into office promising 'swift action' on legal highs. Three years later she is launching a review.

‘In the meantime hundreds of substances have come on to the UK market and thousands of sellers have opened up.

‘While the Government have failed to act, hundreds of thousands of young people have been trying these drugs, and sadly this has often had fatal consequences.

‘While the Home Secretary has been burying her head in the sand, local authorities across the country have been trying to close down the high street shops selling these drugs but they have consistently been thwarted by hopelessly out of date legislation, which allows sellers to pretend that these drugs are research chemicals.

‘Instead of telling local authorities what the law is, the Government should be updating it.’

In July, Labour proposed an amendment to Anti-Social Behaviour Bill to enable successful prosecutions of shops selling legal highs.

Ms Johnson added: ‘If the Government was serious about helping to close down these shops they'd back our amendment in the Lords in January.’
