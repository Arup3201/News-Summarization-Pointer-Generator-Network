Jemima Khan has told Julian Assange to stop hiding from the Swedish authorities and face the sex allegations that await him.

The socialite and former wife of cricket star Imran Khan was among a host of wealthy supporters who put up tens of thousands of pounds to help the WikiLeaks founder meet his £240,000 bail following his arrest in 2010.

But she now faces losing her money, which totaled £20,000, after he apparently breached his bail conditions by spending the past three nights holed up in London's Ecuadorian Embassy in an 11th-hour bid for political asylum.

Supportive friend: Jemima Khan, the socialite and former wife of cricket
star Imran Khan, put up tens of thousands of pounds to help WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, right, meet his £240,000 bail

Mr Assange, 40, is attempting to evade 
extradition to Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in 2010.

In a posting on Twitter, Ms Khan said: 'For the record, in response to those asking about Assange & bail money...

Plea: Ms Khan said she thought Mr Assange should face the charges in Sweden against him

'I personally would like to see 
Assange confront the rape allegations in Sweden and the two women at the
centre have a right to a response.'

However, she added: 'BUT there is no 
doubt that Assange has a real fear of being extradited to the US nor 
that the US gov is out to get WikiLeaks.'

Her
plea came as Mr Assange accused Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard
and the US ambassador to Australia of 'slimy rhetoric', and said he had
received little consular assistance from his home country.

The authorities in Sweden want to extradite him to face trial on rape charges, which he has always denied.

He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that he had chosen against going to the Australian embassy after Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon refused 'reasonable requests' by his lawyer to be involved or intervene in his planned extradition to Sweden.

Branding it an 'effective declaration of abandonment', Mr Assange said: 'There is not a single matter of concern under which the Australian government, as represented by the Attorney-General, would ask other governments to be reasonable or just in this case.

'There are serious issues here, and they are being hidden by the slimy rhetoric coming out of the US ambassador to Australia, via Gillard and by the Foreign Minister - and that needs to stop.'

He walked
into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London three nights ago, claiming 
political asylum and citing his human rights.

Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said the 
South American nation would consider 'whether Julian Assange's life is at 
stake', before making the decision.

It is expected to be made later 
today.

President Correa also said: 'We are 
analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and 
responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis 
of his request is complete.'

A police source today confirmed Assange will be arrested if he leaves the Ecuadorian Embassy.

There
are currently no arrangements in place to provide him with safe passage
out of the UK should he be granted asylum by the South American 
country.

Veteran journalist John Pilger said today that Mr Assange was hopeful that he will be able to leave Britain and start a new life in Ecuador.

He has been given a 'comfortable room with a computer' and a TV inside the embassy where staff have been 'very hospitable', Mr Pilger said.

The journalist was speaking outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in Knightsbridge, where he spent over an hour with Mr Assange.

He said that Mr Assange was 'in great spirits' and busy preparing a document supporting his asylum bid, which he speculated could take up to a fortnight to prepare.

He said: "He is in great spirits - he is in unusually good spirits. When I last saw him which was a few days ago he was not in such high spirits.

Decision time: Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said the South American nation would consider 'whether Julian Assange's life is at stake', before making the decision

'He is very hopeful that this will resolve itself, that he will be granted political asylum in Ecuador and that he will be allowed to leave.

'What they are doing at the moment and what he is doing is putting together a major document of the threats against Julian Assange that have come mainly from the US.

'That is absolutely imperative for political asylum. The document will assess the threats that have been made by major political figures in the US.'

Mr Pilger accused Ms Gillard of providing 'misinformation' about the support being provided to Mr Assange by his home country.

He added: 'I don't think he expects to face a breach of bail charge - this is an extraordinary situation.

'This is a man who has not been prosecuted with anything. He has not been charged or convicted of anything.

'He has spent more than 18 months under virtual house arrest, and he is a man who has the right to the presumption of innocence.

'I don't know how long this will last. I think there is the expectation that something will happen in the next week or two.

'He has a room - the Ecuadorians have been very hospitable to him.

'He has a room, he is in there preparing these documents that are needed for the development if this political asylum case.

'It's not a big place - it's a fairly big room with a computer - it's a comfortable room.

'People are coming in and out. He looks pretty healthy to me.'

Mr Pilger would not confirm whether or not Assange has been given a bed in the embassy for his stay.

In a telephone 
interview with ABC from inside
the embassy yesterday, Mr Assange said he did not know when the 
decision would be made.

The 40-year-old Australian said there was no guarantee his request would be accepted.

He told ABC’s Radio National 
programme he was not prepared to go to Sweden because of the conditions 
in which he believes he would be held there.

He
said: 'The Swedes announced publicly, that they would detain me, in 
prison, without charge while they continued their so-called 
investigation.

'We had 
heard that the Ecuadorians were sympathetic in relation to my struggles 
and the struggles of the organisation with the United States, and the 
ability to exercise that option was at an effective end.'

Protest: Supporters of Julian Assange demonstrated outside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where the Wikileaks founder has sought political asylum

But Scotland Yard said he faced 
arrest for breaching his bail conditions – while a list of high-profile 
supporters, led by socialite Jemima Khan, risk losing tens of thousands 
of pounds they put up to keep him out of jail.

The desperate move by Mr Assange, 40, stunned Miss Khan, who confirmed she was one of those who put up the cash for him.

Asked
on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she 
replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as 
surprised as anyone by this.'

Embassies are regarded as 'safe 
havens' which British police cannot enter. While Mr Assange remains 
inside the building he is safe from arrest – and extradition.

He
requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, 
ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech.

But Mr Assange is friendly with the 
South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa.

Last month the 
Australian interviewed him for his new TV series The World Tomorrow, 
broadcast on the Russian state-sponsored Today TV channel, in which the 
president – who has clashed with Washington – praised WikiLeaks and the 
two men laughed and joked.

The dramatic move to seek refuge 
inside the embassy came days after the Supreme Court rejected Mr 
Assange's appeal against extradition. He was expected to be sent to 
Sweden within a fortnight.

He denies the Swedish allegations but 
fears it may lead to him being sent to the US to face charges over his 
whistle-blowing website, for which he could face the death penalty for 
espionage.
