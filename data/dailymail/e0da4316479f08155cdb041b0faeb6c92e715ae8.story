Angelina Jolie 'didn't care that she was branded a 'spoiled brat,' claimed the disgraced Sony boss whose emails were hacked.

Amy Pascal, the outgoing co-chairman of Sony Pictures, said that 'everybody understood' because they all lived in 'this weird thing called Hollywood.'

In the exchange between Mrs Pascal and Hollywood producer Scott Rudin the actress, who is married to Brad Pitt, was described as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat.'

'Angie didn't care,' Mrs Pascal said, according to the website Recode.

'Everybody understood because we all live in this weird thing called Hollywood. If we all actually were nice, it wouldn't work.' 

Mrs Pascal made the comments during the Women World Conference in San Francisco.

'All the women here are doing incredible things in this world. All I did was get fired,' she said, according to the  site.

The email exchange between Mr Rudin and Mrs Pascal began because Jolie wanted director David Fincher to oversee her planned remake of Cleopatra instead of a Steve Jobs biopic written by Aaron Sorkin.

Rudin wrote to Pascal: 'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me)...I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don't.' 

In the emails Rudin added that he was 'not destroying my career over a minimally talented spoiled brat.'

Pascal responded: 'You better shut Angie down before she makes it very hard for David to do Jobs.'

In another of the offensive email exchanges that emerged, Mrs Pascal made racist jokes about the US President, suggesting that he would like films about slavery or that centred on black characters.

'Should I ask him if he liked Django?,' she wrote.

In one discussion, she told a producer who complained about Leonardo DiCaprio that the Wolf of Wall Street star is 'actually despicable'. 

In some of the leaked messages Mrs Pascal insulted some of the Hollywood studio's most bankable stars.

The hack attack was linked to North Korea, and is thought to have been an attempt to force Sony to scrap The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of the country's leader, Kim Jong-un.

At the event in San Francisco Mrs Pascal was asked about the emails regarding President, and described it was 'horrible,' according to the website. 

She was also asked about paying Jennifer Lawrence less money than her male co-stars in American Hustle by interviewer Tina Brown.

Mrs Pascal said that she was running a business and has paid Lawrence a 'lot more since,' 

It was announced late last week that Mrs Pascal was leaving her role as the co-chairman of Sony Pictures this May.

Just three days later Mrs Pascal was named as co-producer for the latest installment of the company's multi-billion pound Spider-Man franchise.
