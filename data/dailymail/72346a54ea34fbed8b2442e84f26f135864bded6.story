Jumping out of a plane flying hundreds of feet up in the air with a parachute would seem terrifying enough for most people.

But two Norwegian thrill-seekers decided to make things a little more interesting by jumping into downtown Rio de Janeiro wearing wingsuits and gliding between two sky scrapers.

Stomach-churning footage shows scenes filmed from helmet cameras of Ludovic Woerth and Jokke Sommer as they cheat death by squeezing through a gap just a few feet wide.

Ludovic Woerth and Jokke Sommer cheated death by gliding between two buildings on a wingsuit flight into Rio de Janeiro

An action camera showed the first flyer (wearing a blue wingsuit) seemed to drift towards the right-hand building

The video looks like an ordinary skydive film at first, but as the two men clad in wingsuits fall closer to earth it is clear they are hurtling towards a densely populated area.

As they approach the Brazilian capital it appears one of the jumpers is about to suffer a fatal accident by colliding with one of the city skyscrapers.

But incredibly he drifts through the gap
 between two buildings and lands safely in a courtyard below where he is
 met by music and cheers and whistles from a crowd.

As he hits the ground the first diver cries out: 'Woo hoo,' before running over to his collegue.

The action camera shows just how narrow the gap is which the two men navigated their way through to safety

Could nine: Breathtaking footage shows just how high up the men were at the start of their jump

Ludovic Woerth and Jokke Sommer did not have permission to fly into the Brazilian capital so they set off before commercial flights

The pair seem high on adrenalin, and the first says: 'Mucho, mucho, mucho! That was...sick, that was low. That projection. It was recording!'

His friend responds: 'I know.'

Posting the video online, professional daredevil Mr Sommer said: 'We did not have permission to fly into the city, but to respect the commercial air traffic we did the jump 5.45 in the morning. The first flights arrive at 6.05am'
