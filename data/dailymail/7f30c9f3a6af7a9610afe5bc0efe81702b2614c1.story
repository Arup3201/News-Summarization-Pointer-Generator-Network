Ordeal: Laurie Eberhardt, 67, was shot in the wrist by a stray bullet as she celebrated New Year's Eve

A grandmother has been hit by a falling bullet while watching New Year's Eve fireworks from a balcony of a Florida yacht club.

Laurie Eberhardt, 67, was watching the display after an evening of dinner and dancing with her husband and friends at  St. Petersburg Yacht Club when she felt a searing pain in her wrist shortly after midnight.

A bullet had entered her right wrist and travelled up her arm before exiting halfway up her forearm. Police believe it came from a rifle that someone fired in the air to celebrate New Year.

'She looked down and saw the entry hole 
and the bleeding and said, "I've been shot!"' her husband Henry Eberhardt, 73, told the Tampa Bay Times.

Her friends struggled to comprehend exactly what she had said.

'It's not something you're going to hear people say all the time,' Mr Eberhardt added.

'It's just excruciating,' his wife told WTSP of the experience. 'It's almost like fire going into my arm and my wrist. I've never felt anything so painful and so scary.'

One of their friends, a retired physician, helped her get seated and apply pressure to the wound while others called 911.

She was taken to Bayfront Medical Center, 
where doctors removed a large-caliber bullet from her wrist, and she was released three hours later.

Yet she said she is still reeling from the terrifying experience.

'I was extremely lucky that the 
bullet, which fell from the sky as downtown St. Petersburg's celebration
took place, did not cause a more serious injury or even my death,' Mrs 
Eberhardt said in a statement.

'This has been one of the most horrifying experiences of my life.'

An investigation into the shooting is ongoing, police said.
While police do not know where the bullet came from, they could match 
it to the gun if evidence leads them to the weapon, police said.

Hit: Diego Duran, 12

More people are injured or killed each year by falling bullets than many would believe.

From 1985 to 1992, 118 victims of gunshot wounds in the Los Angeles area alone were thought to have been struck by them.

These included people hit by bullets while going about their everyday business.

The chance of being killed by a falling bullet is much higher than a typical shooting - because those unlucky enough to be hit by falling shells are more likely to be struck on the head.

Doctors say a spent bullet falls back to Earth with a speed of between 90 and 180 metres per second. A bullet travelling at less than 60 metres per second can cause a fatal skull injury.

Last year, Diego Duran (pictured) was shot in the head while celebrating NYE outside his Florida home, but survived. It came weeks after Rachel Yoder, a teenage Amish girl, died in a 'freak accident' in Ohio after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile away.

Authorities have noted more injuries caused by gunshots into the air in recent years.

'People think of it as harmless, 
because they're point up in the air,' St Petersburg police spokesman 
Mike Puetz said. 'But it's been shown time and time again; this is just 
one of those things that can have very, very, negative results.

'It's obviously in the public mind now 
about this type of issue. But we still run into the situation where, 
unfortunately, some members of the public are not getting the message.'

The shooting comes a year after 12-year-old Diego Duran was hit in the head by a bullet while watching New Year's fireworks outside his family's home in Ruskin, Florida.

The boy's mother saw him fall to the ground, bleeding from his eyes and nose. He was rushed to hospital and staff found a bullet had entered the top of his head and had become lodged in his cheek.

Diego survived the ordeal and his family has since formed the nonprofit group Bullet Free Sky to raise awareness of the dangers of celebratory gunfire.

It came after a 15-year-old Amish 
girl, Rachel Yoder, was shot dead while riding her horse and cart back 
from a Christmas party after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile 
away.

At first it was thought she died as a result of falling from her buggy after her brother found her in a pool of blood. But when she got to the hospital they found a bullet lodged in her head.

Holmes
County Sheriff Timothy Zimmerly told ABC News the man said he was 
preparing to clean his muzzle-loaded rifle after deer hunting and fired 
it into the air.
