They're two of Tinseltown's most famous teens with a clothing collection, book series and reality TV show under their belts

But Kendall and Kylie Jenner are about to get even bigger - they are in talks with Topshop about selling their own range of clothes in the store. 

According to The Sun, the duo are set to design whole collection, which will be sold exclusively at the high street chain.

The sisters are reportedly in advanced negotiations with the retailer over their contract, which would allow them to configure the collection themselves. 

A source told the newspaper: 'Talks are ongoing but the family are keen to work with Topshop, who will give the brand a huge push this summer.'

Kendall, 19, and 17-year-old Kylie - the youngest daughters of Kris Jenner and Bruce Jenner and half-sisters of Kim Kardashian West and Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian - are believed to have been approached by the high street clothes shop because of their rocketing profiles.

Just this week, Kendall caused a stir when she took to the catwalk for Chanel at Paris Fashion Week this week.

Sir Philip Green, right, the chairman of Arcadia Group, which runs Topshop, is keen to work with Kendall after being impressed by the reality star when they met at the British Fashion Awards in December

The source added: 'Kendall and Kylie have become hugely influential in the fashion world, so it's no wonder Topshop wants to work with them. They have a massive fan base of young girls and a reach of tens of millions on social media.'

Although the lucrative collaboration is not yet a done deal, Sir Philip Green, the chairman of Arcadia Group, which runs Topshop, is keen to get it signed off.

He was hugely impressed with Kendall when they met at the British Fashion Awards in December, where they were sat on the same table.

The source added: 'Philip was totally taken by Kendall and made it his mission to sign her.'

Kendall is already in with the brand; she sat front row at Topshop Unique's show last February, next to Sir Philip Green, Anna Wintour and  Kate Moss.

Kendall and Kylie's sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe have worked with Philip Green before when they launched a clothing range with another of his high street stores, Dorothy Perkins. 

Kendall has certainly secured her name in the fashion world, here she is walking in the Chanel show in Paris this week

She might be a reality TV star, but at heart, Kendall is clearly a model through and through, just look at her here on the runway at Chanel, styled in the Spring Haute Couture collection.

Wearing a sheer cropped shirt and organza floral skirt, teamed with boots, Karl Lagerfeld has mixed moody florals with romantic sheer material creating a stunning look (just one of many!)

Of course with Chanel Couture, you cannot buy the look so try not to get your hopes up. But what you can do, is take inspiration from this great designer and inject the trend into your wardrobe in preparation for the spring/summer season.

Florals of course are going to be all the rage, but make your pick an A-line skirt to work Kendall's sophisticated look. Take a look at the organza skirt at Asos for an ethereal feel that's a total bargain and team with a cropped tee or shirt to nail the look in style.

Kendall was thrust into the limelight at the age of 14, when she appeared alongside the rest of her family on the hit TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 

But it has been her lifelong dream to break away from the television programme that propelled her to fame and cement her name as a model - and now Kendall is making her fantasy a reality.

The has youngest of the Kardashian clan has already walked in the season's hottest fashion week shows and was recently unveiled as the face of Estée Lauder.

Then recently, Karl Lagerfeld, who is largely considered to be the fashion industry's most esteemed designer, revealed that Kendall has been chosen as the face of his SS15 campaign.
