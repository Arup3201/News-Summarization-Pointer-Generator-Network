From giant wigs adorned with flowers to tops created entirely out of body paint, these are the beauty looks you might not be rushing to try out this season. 

At the STS Beauty show in Barcelona today models on the catwalk presented body painting by students of the Thuya School for Personal Image.

While some models were decorated to look like mythical woodland creatures, others had muscles daubed in make-up  and one woman wore an impressive geisha-style outfit, with the 'top' of the kimono created entirely out of paint.

The models at the show wore outfits that were made entirely of body paint with flowers in their hair and colourful outlandish outfits

This model wore an intricate geisha outfit in which the 'top' is drawn with paint along with  a giant wig adorned with flowers and fabric

Some models were topless during the show, covered in thick layer of paint, with arresting headpieces such as a pair of branch antlers (left) while another (right), with a ballerina drawn on her stomach, was styled to look like a black swan with an elaborate bird and feather headdress

Today is the last day of the event which runs for three days in the Spanish city - the fair is for professional make-up and beauty experts. 

The Thuya school has been running for over 20 years and also sells a number of beauty products. Starting in 1988 they began with a selection of nail products such as acrylic nails and a selection of nail varnishes.

The students of the school showed off their wild and wacky ideas at the STS show, one model wore a giant pair of antlers, another wore a bird on her head while another had hair that looked like it was made out of a tree. 

Many of the models showcased a clever mixture of body paint and fabric to complete their intricate outfits.

Funny faces: One model looked as though they had been dressed as a deer while another had a cartoon character painted on his stomach 

Wow: All of the looks showcased at the show were startlingly different, one model (right) was painted to look like she was made of wood 

One of the model at the show was seen wearing this giant headdress with an intricate blue and black pattern as she glided down the catwalk

This model is turned into a walking jungle with a lion drawn on her front, a parrot on her back and a huge headdress made of leaves
