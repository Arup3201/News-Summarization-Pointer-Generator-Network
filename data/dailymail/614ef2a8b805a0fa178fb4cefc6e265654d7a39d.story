Workers were given the runaround at Heathrow Airport after a swan on the runway delayed more than 20 flights.

With planes queuing up, and an Air France flight dormant on the runway, this hilarious footage shows two members of staff and their efforts to snare the feathered fiend.

The bird was not going to go quietly, and refused to be scooped up. 

The men resorted to using the car as a kind of battering ram to shepherd the feathered fiend off the runway

So using a car to shunt it off the main runway, the two airport workers do their best to get services resuming at Europe's busiest airport.

Clapping at the swan to encourage it to fly off did not work, and it was seemingly intent on having a bit of fun on the tarmac.

The runway was closed for around nine minutes before the swan was pinned down and taken off to Heathrow's bird hazard management team.

The video was accompanied by a running commentary by those watching the action unfold. 

Comments of 'They're going to come round to shoot it,' and 'they can have it for Christmas dinner,' add to the fun-filed episode.

Flights were queueing for around nine minutes, but Heathrow insist there were 'no delays'

The swan for all intents and purposes seems to be having a bit of fun with his supposed capturers

When the video was posted on YouTube, it led to some unsurprisingly amusing comments.

Gregster295 Aviation & Rail Videography wrote: 'They were in a bit of a flap there,' while Si Davey added: 'This has really brightened up my evening! It's just too funny. 

'The background commentary from your fellow passengers was equally entertaining.'

The audio and visual commentary make the video seem somewhat slapstick

Finally the two men manage to capture the swan and normal service can resume at Heathrow

A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport told the Evening Standard: 'Heathrow's bird hazard management team responded quickly and safely removed the swan to reopen the runway.

'Once rescued, the swan was taken to our animal reception centre to be properly looked after by the onsite team.'
