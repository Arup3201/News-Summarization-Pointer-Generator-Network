It's an age-old idiom, but a New York-based Italian artist wants to know the truth - what is it like to actually find a needle in a haystack? And is it even possible?

Sven Sachsalber spent 48 hours sifting through a giant pile of hay dumped in at the  Palais de Tokyo gallery in Paris.

In the pile of hay he searched for a needle hidden deep in its centre by the prestigious modern art gallery's president Jean de Loisy.

Sachsalber says the 'art installation' is something easy to understand for the general public

De Loisy says the installation isn't just a man taking on the ultimate hide-and-seek challenge as it explored the complex relationship between words and actions, juxtaposing metaphors for the immensely small and the incomprehensibly large and complex

'I don't think there is anyone, regardless of whether they like modern art or not, who would not be intrigued by this childish question -- can it actually be done, or is "Searching for a needle in a haystack" simply a turn of phrase?' De Loisy said.

The two-day timeframe was set as a limit since Sachsalber could have simply taken minutes to find the needle, though that was considered unlikely. 

Sachsalber said that the project was a practical one that the general public would find accessible.

He said: 'It's like playing the lottery, so you don't know if you're going to win or not, you hope you're going to win otherwise why play the lottery? And it's the same thing here, even if it's hard I think, because it's itchy, this hay, and I have it everywhere after a few hours, but it's fun at the same time.

'And it's very accessible, I think you don't really need to understand much about art or whatever, just everyone knows what it is,' he said.

Although he avoids the label 'performance artist', Sachsalber has a history of engaging in unusual, even dangerous, activities in the name of art.

'I have never considered myself as a conceptual artist, other people did,' he said.

His escapades include eating a highly toxic wild mushroom, spending 24 hours in a room with a cow, cutting down a tree he was precariously perched on and climbing over gravestones pretending to be a squirrel.

'Even though it might look stupid, I just want to test out these things,' he said.
