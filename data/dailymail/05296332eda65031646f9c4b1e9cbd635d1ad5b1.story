As transformations go, it was nothing short of astonishing.

Just three hours after she was seen walking down the street yesterday in black skinny jeans and brown polka dot pussy-bow blouse on her way to the hairdressers, Carole Middleton arrived at the Royal christening in style.

With her shoulder-length brunette hair scraped back in a hair clip, the 58-year-old matriarch was virtually unnoticeable as she left her daughter Pippa’s London flat just before 11.30am.

But after a stint with her stylist, 
Mrs Middleton - who topped numerous best-dressed lists for her choice of
 outfit at the royal wedding - was ready to hold her own with royalty.

It
 is not known who was responsible for her make-over, although she and 
her daughters do favour the Richard Ward salon on nearby King’s Road.

Carole
 left her slightly harassed-looking husband, Michael, back at the 
family’s Chelsea crash pad while she underwent her makeover.

But
 like all men, he was only required to don a suit. Afterwards there was 
just time to do her make-up - like her daughters Carole prefers to do 
her own and favours lashings of eyeliner - before heading off to the 
palace.

Once again her choice of outfit was spot on - a Catherine Walker and Co ‘Iris’ coatdress made from navy, superfine merino wool.

Its elegant lines were enhanced by inset panels of chalk grey silk at the sides, mounted with a delicate navy floral Calais lace.

All of Catherine Walker’s outfit are made-to-measure for clients and would cost upwards of £2,000.

Carole teamed her outfit with a soft grey hat with a satin trim by milliner Jane Corbett - a favourite of all the Middleton ladies.

George’s other granny, the Duchess of Cornwall, was wearing a cream Georgette dress, featuring embroidery on the neck, and a cream bouclé coat, both by Fiona Clare, with a Philip Treacy hat.
