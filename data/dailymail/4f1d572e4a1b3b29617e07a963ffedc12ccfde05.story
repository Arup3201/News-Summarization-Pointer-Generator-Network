Kim Jong-Un has been 're-elected' as leader of North Korea having executed his politically-powerful uncle last year and successfully disposed of 11 high-ranking government officials over the weekend.

After a pre-determined vote, in which no-one else was allowed to stand, Kim was reaffirmed as First Chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission (NDC) by the country's new rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly.

The state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) described the election as 'the great jubilee in the nation's history' and told how parliament cheered as the result was announced.

Kim Jong-Un casts his ballot during last month's North Korean 'elections'. He has now been reaffirmed as First Chairman of the National Defence Commission, the country's most powerful body

'All the deputies and participants in the session broke into stormy cheers of "hurrah!", extending the highest glory and warmest congratulations to him,' KCNA said.

Last month North Koreans cast ballots in a pre-determined election where all of the candidates stood unopposed.

Kim had his uncle and former political mentor Jang Song-thaek executed last year

The rubber-stamp assembly is the first under the leadership of Kim who took over from his father in December 2011.

In the shadowy world of North Korean politics the NDC is widely seen as the nation’s highest decision-making body.

Kim's uncle and political mentor Jang Song-thaek, who was executed as a traitor in December last year before reportedly being fed to a pack of hungry dogs, had previously served as vice chairman.

Kim is now expected to appoint several elderly military leaders, including defence minister Jang Jong-Nam and chief of the military's general staff Ri Yong-Gil,  to the commission.

Yesterday it was reported that one of Jang's closes associates, O Sang-hon was executed with a flamethrower after being branded an 'enemy of the state'.

Mr O is thought to be the latest of 11 senior Workers Party figures to have been executed this year over their links to Mr Jang, with South Korean media reporting that Kim Jong-un has plans to execute or imprison hundreds more of his supporters and extended family members.

Mr O had been Mr Jang's deputy at North Korea's ministry of public security. The ministry has since been closed, with all 11 of the most senior officials said to have been either executed or sent to one of Kim Jong-un's concentration camps.
