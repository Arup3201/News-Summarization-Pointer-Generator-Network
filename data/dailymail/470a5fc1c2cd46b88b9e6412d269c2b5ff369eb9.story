Sporting Kansas City's Dom Dwyer has taken goal celebrations to a whole new level - by running up to the crowd and taking a selfie.

The English-born forward, who spent his youth career at Norwich was given a hidden mobile phone by a member of staff close to the pitch and he snapped a photo in front of the crowd and the advertising hoardings with team-mate Soony Saad.

He was booked for celebrating the opening goal by the referee in charge of the MLS match, Alan Kelly, between Kansas City and Chicago Fire, which finished 1-1.
