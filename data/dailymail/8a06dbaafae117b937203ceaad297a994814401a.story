Low-cost airline Wizz Air will become the first to make passengers pay to bring hand luggage into the cabin.

Passengers travelling between Luton and the Polish city of Katowice will be charged Â£8 to carry items larger than a handbag, rucksack or laptop on board under trial policy being introduced next month.

If the trial is successful the policy will be rolled out across the whole Wizz Air network.

Heading for turbulence? Wizz Air is introducing extra fees for 'larger' hand baggage items

If the dimensions of a bag exceed 42cm x 32cm x 25cm, its owner will be expected to pay the additional fee to keep it with them - even if it fits inside an overhead locker.

If the item is smaller, the passenger will be allowed to take it on board free of charge - as long as it fits underneath the seat in front of them.

Customers paying the fee for a trolley case or other larger item of hand luggage will be able to board the plane early - after priority passengers - to ensure there is sufficient space in overhead lockers.

Bags that measure 55cm x 40cm x 20cm or larger, or that weigh more than 10kg, must be checked into the hold.

Small trolley cases such as the one pictured would be unlikely to meet Wizz Air's new criteria

Wizz Air claims the trial will 'reduce boarding hassle and improve on-time performance, and result in a better overall travel experience'.

Travel industry commentator Bob Atkinson, from TravelSupermarket, described the maximum size for free hand luggage under Wizz Air's trial policy as 'tiny'.

'If you are trying to avoid paying to check in bags by using hand luggage, this is bad news,' he said.

'It forces people to travel with next to nothing if they don't want to pay extra.'

Mr Atkinson said customers could get a shock if they found themselves being charged extra for what they thought was a 'regular-sized' piece of hand luggage.

'Customers are unlikely to be happy at having to pay for something that they have previously taken for granted,' he said.

'I would be horrified if I saw other airlines following this idea - but I wouldn't be surprised to see other budget carriers looking at this.

'It's all about revenue.'

Wizz Air currently flies from Luton to a range of destinations across Europe, including Prague, Warsaw, Split in Croatia, Vilnius in Lithuania, and Ljubljana in Slovenia.
