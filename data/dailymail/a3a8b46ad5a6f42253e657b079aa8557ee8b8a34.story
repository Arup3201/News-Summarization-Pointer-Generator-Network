Lindsey Vonn was forced to undergo a drugs test during New York's 'fashion Oscars' while wearing a custom-made designer gown, according to reports.

The four-time World Champion skier girlfriend of Tiger Woods was tracked down by drugs testers as she attended the Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards on Monday night.

Vonn, who is in training for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was forced to slip away from the glitzy event to give a urine sample for the unannounced test.

Vonn, who was wearing a custom-made gown by designer Cynthia Rowley, got the call on her mobile phone as she sat among the fashion elite such as Anna Wintour and Ralph Lauren, according to Page Six

The website quoted a source as saying: 'Lindsay met the IOC at the bathroom. Cynthia stood guard outside, and no one was allowed to enter the bathroom. They were in there for about five minutes.'

Vonn told the New York Post afterwards: 'We’re having a great time and [Rowley] did a great job with the dress.'

Out of Olympic competition, the United States Ski and Snowboarding Association (USSA) is responsible for drugs testing as required by the International Ski Federation and the World Anti-Doping Agency.

 During the Olympics, the International Olympic Association tests the top five finishers in ever event and two others at random.

Outside of competition, individual sport's governing bodies takes over responsibility.

Athletes will be subject to both in and out-of-competition testing.

They can be tested without any advanced notice, which can occur at any time and any location.

U.S. athletes will be notified of their selection for doping control, by a USADA doping control officer  or USADA Chaperone.

Those who refuse a test or miss a number of tests can be banned from competing, lose medals or titles or disqualified from an event.

Last month, the skier, was linked to the sports facility overseen by notorious former 'doping doctor' Bernd Pansold.

The
German doctor, 71, was one of hundreds of doctors at the forefront of a
doping epidemic in the former East Germany, which fed unwitting young athletes hardcore 
performance enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids in what was a 
state-sponsored programme in the 1970s and 80s.

He now oversees the Red Bull-owned Diagnostics
and Training Centre in Austria, which Vonn has visited several times, 
according to the investigation by the New York Daily News.

While
there is no suggestion alpine ski champion Vonn, who is sponsored by 
Red Bull, has ever taken PEDs - and has never failed a dope test - her 
visits to Pansold, show how vulnerable today's Olympic stars are to the
murky past of doping.

Her 
publicist initially denied the visits but later acknowledged the 
28-year-old had undertaken tests at the lab and had exchanged nothing 
more than pleasantries with the doctor.

Vonn is currently recovering from a serious knee injury after a 80mph crash in February.

She tore the anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in her right knee, as well as suffering a fractured tibia after crashing while on a downhill run in Schlamding, Austria on February 5th.

At the fashion awards at the Lincoln Center in New York on Monday, the skier spoke of her romance with Woods.

Vonn and Woods announced they were a couple in March and she said they 'are just happy'

The couple publicly confirmed they were an item in March after several months of dating.

'We're
similar. We're both at the top of our sports, and we 
relate really well to each other.'

The world champion skier also told People magazine she and the 37-year-old Woods 'just are happy.

'There's not much distance. I'm just in the gym right now, so I can be anywhere,' the Winter Olympian explains.

'I'm not skiing until September. So, it's been great. We haven't really been apart that much.'
