A winemaker from Cornwall has become the first English vintner to be shortlisted in the world’s top sparkling wine award - competing against some of France’s most famous champagne houses. 

Sam Lindo, from Camel Valley Wines, is one of only three winemakers in the world to be nominated for the International Sparkling Winemaker of the Year.

The 37-year-old, is the first English winemaker to make the shortlist in the history of English wine.

It is so prestigious, his wife is even allowing him to leave the county to attend the award ceremony next month despite being due to give birth around the time of the ceremony next month.

Mr Lindo told The Telegraph: ‘This award is like the Oscars. Just to be shortlisted is fantastic. It will put our vineyard on the map.

'One of the two champagne makers shortlisted for the award, Charles Heidsieck has already won it a few times.

‘To knock him off his perch would be quite a coup. For an English wine to beat French champagne houses would definitely cause quite a stir. It feels slightly ridiculous.’

The award will be announced at the International Wine Challenge 2014 Awards Dinner on 16 July at the Grosvenor House Hotel.

The other two contenders are Régis Camus from Champagne Charles Heidsieck and Laurent Fresnet from Champagne Henriot.

Mr Lindo is a three-times UK Winemaker of the Year and Camel Valley has won several awards over the years.

He said: ‘Everyone loves a David and Goliath story. But we’re very French in the way we make our wine.

‘We’re not interested in being better than other. We just want to make the best wine we can.

‘Like many winemakers in France we don’t really feel like we make wine. Nature and the weather make wine.

‘We believe we couldn’t make our wine anywhere else in the world. We make the wine that is suitable for our region and we respect that. We’re not trying to be something else.’

It is no mean feat for the West Country winemakers as the International Wine Challenge awards have been running for over 30 years are competed for and recognised globally.

A spokesperson for the International Wine Challenge awards said: ‘Just for a vineyard to be nominated is a massive coup and any wine producer who wins the International Sparkling Winemaker of the Year can expect their sales to go through the roof. The award has worldwide recognition.’

Both types of wine from Camel Valley Wines are available from selected Waitrose branches as well as Fortnum and Masons and Berry Bros.

The 2012 Pinot Noir Rose is around £27 a bottle while the 2009 Chardonnay Brut costs £24.95.
