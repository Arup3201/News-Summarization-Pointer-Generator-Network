A visibly moved Vin Diesel yesterday visited the site where Paul Walker died in a car crash, paying an emotional tribute to the crowds that have gathered there.

Speaking through a sheriff’s megaphone, Walker's Fast & Furious co-star said: 'If my brother were here right now and saw all the love that you're bringing here.

'If he could see for himself that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever.

'I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going to stay with me for ever.'

Vin Diesel arrived at the fatal crash site on Monday to pay tribute to his Fast & Furious co-star and to thank the crowds who had gathered to pay their respects

A steady stream of fans has flocked to the crash site to leave flowers, candles and memorabilia from the action films.

While the neighbourhood where Fast & Furious star Paul Walker died in a fiery crash is known to attract street racers, law enforcement officials do not believe the Porsche he and friend Roger Rodas were riding in had been racing another car.

Accident investigators ‘have received eyewitness statements that the car involved was traveling alone at a high rate of speed,’ the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a written statement Monday. ‘No eyewitness has contacted the (department) to say there was a second vehicle.’

Walker and his friend and fellow fast-car enthusiast Roger Rodas died on Saturday when Rodas' 2005 Porsche Carrera GT smashed into a light pole and tree, then exploded in flames. The posted limit was 45 mph.

The two had taken what was expected to be a brief drive away from a charity fundraiser and toy drive at Rodas' custom car shop in the Southern California community of Valencia, about 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Walker's publicist said the action star was the passenger.

The crash happened on a street that forms an approximately 1-mile loop amid industrial office parks. It is rimmed by hills and relatively isolated from traffic, especially on weekends when the businesses are closed.

‘It's well-known out here that that's a hot spot for street racers,’ California Highway Patrol Sergeant Rick Miler said.

Skid marks are a testament to past antics on the loop. The sheriff's department, which polices the neighborhood, said Saturday's wreck was not the first speed-related crash there, but would not reveal specifics.

The Fast and Furious star spoke to gathered crowds through a police car loudspeaker.

He said: 'If my brother were here right now and
 saw all the love that you're bringing here. If he could see for himself
 that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard 
time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've 
shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever.

'I
 just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and 
showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going 
to stay with me for ever.'

Meanwhile, investigators are consulting video from security cameras, talking to eyewitnesses and analyzing physical evidence such as on-board computer data from the Porsche.

Officials have not named either person found in the car.

'The bodies were so badly burned by the fire that engulfed the wreck that dental records will be needed to confirm their identities.

Walker and Rodas had bonded over their shared love of fast cars.

Rodas, 38, and Walker, 40, co-owned an auto racing team named after Rodas' shop, Always Evolving.

'Rodas was a financial adviser as well as a professional driver who competed in 10 Pirelli World Challenge GTS races in 2013.

'He finished second in rookie of the year standings, circuit spokesman Dave Drimmie said.
