A Palmer United Party candidate for the upcoming Queensland election is making a big impression on voters not because of his policies but because of his prominent moustache.

Martin Brewster, who is Clive Palmer's nephew, is running on behalf of Mr Palmer's party in the North Queensland seat of Hinchinbrook.

The Palmer United Party posted pictures of its candidates to Facebook and Twitter and the photo of Mr Brewster has drawn plenty of reaction with people making jokes and likening him to Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs Of New York, Nintendo character Luigi and a 'railway bandit'.

'As a political cartoonist I would totally vote for Martin Brewster,' joked @jonkudelka.

'Queenslanders: you must vote the railway bandit to Hinchinbrook in the upcoming election. Our country depends on it,' wrote @jrhennessy.

Meanwhile @olliemilman posted: 'If you're not at least considering Martin Brewster, people of Hinchinbrook, then you need to look at yourself and your anti-mo views.'

Mr Brewster, who is an executive at Clive Palmer's company Queensland Nickel, is campaigning against the Newman Government's plan to sell and lease Queensland's assets.

'The privatisation of Queensland's assets, including schools and other education facilities, will deny Queenslanders access to quality education and training facilities,' Mr Brewster said.

'This is a very important issue facing many Queenslanders including those living in the electorate of Hinchinbrook.

'We consider this election to be a referendum on asset sales, Labor was voted out in 2012 because Anna Bligh tried to sell off our assets and now Campbell Newman is doing the same thing.'

Mr Brewster has lived in the Hinchinbrook electorate, which covers the Queensland coastline between Townsville and Innisfail, for 20 years.

The seat's current MP is the Liberal National Party's Andrew Cripps.

The Queensland election will be held on January 31.
