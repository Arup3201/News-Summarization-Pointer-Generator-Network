Ever had a hankering for a toe spreading and grooming kit or what about Chinese cupping equipment? These were among the hot ticket items snapped up by bargain hunters during Sydney Airport's first-ever on-line lost property auction, which was raised $154,000 for a range of charities.

More than 2000 items went under the hammer including the expected late model cameras, smartphones and tablets and then there were more unconventional items; including the Asian remedial massage equipment, microwave ovens, ukuleles, olive oil cans and even a toe maintenance pack for $59.

There were countless bargains to be had, with bidding beginning at just $1 for most, including three GHD (hair straightening equipment) which went for $240.

'We would like to thank the public for supporting the auction, our auction house reported website traffic 20 times higher than normal during the auction period,' Sydney Airport chief executive officer Kerrie Mather said.

The auction was divided into six categories, with a viewing day ahead of time allowing the public to inspect the items for sale. All pieces were unreserved, with proceeds pledged to Sydney Airport’s community program.

Chinese Cupping Kit $36

'This year, we supported a range of charities and community groups in both our local area as well as nationally and we’re looking forward to announcing more next year,' Ms Mather said.

Items left at the airport are logged into a system and stored at the airport for two months to give owners the opportunity to claim their goods or where items are clearly labelled, Sydney Airport endeavours to reunite them with their owners.

However, for items which remain unclaimed, Sydney Airport places them in the lost property sale.

Another on-line auction to sell items not collected in this year’s sale will be held early next year, with the proceeds also earmarked for charity.

All of the 1500 plus items which went under the hammer had been handed in as lost property from the T1 international and T2 domestic terminals.

'They come from all over the place, but the main places where things are lost are in the food courts, at terminals and at security checkpoints where people forget things in the trays,' Sydney Airport Communications Manager Tracy Ong said.

'There were golf clubs, some brand new iPads, even two four-litre tines of olive oil, microwave ovens, induction cook tops, rice cookers, designer shoes, sunglasses and perfumes and a coffee machine.'

Jewellery of varying quality are part of the on-line auction held for charity

You would think a bike would be hard to forget right? Bikes, tennis racquets, surfboards are all among the wide variety of forgotten items which went up for grabs in the auction which raised $154,000

There were countless kids items including scooters and mini skateboards

The Airport's Corporate Affairs GM, Sally Fielke said: 'Close to 38 million passengers travelled through Sydney Airport last year from all over the world and the items left at the airport reflect this diversity.'

Ms Fielke said that last year's charity raised over $130,000 for the Salvation Army and the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation, which supports children living in families affected by mental illness.

'While we make every effort to reunite the thousands of lost items that are left at Sydney Airport each year with their owners, unfortunately hundreds of items are left unclaimed,' Ms Fielke added.
