The US Government’s bid to put Abu Hamza behind bars for his alleged links to Al Qaeda has  been thrown into doubt after the British terrorist who is the star prosecution witness refused to fly to America to give evidence against the preacher.

Hate cleric Hamza is due to stand trial later this month in a federal court in New York, accused of sending extremists to Afghanistan to fight for Al Qaeda, as well as trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the US state of Oregon.

One of the key prosecution witnesses is the convicted British terrorist Saajid Badat, 35, a former lieutenant of Hamza who was sent by him to fight in Afghanistan for Al Qaeda.

Badat, a former grammar school boy from Gloucester, pulled out of a plot to blow up a transatlantic airliner with a shoe bomb in 2001.

Although he was jailed for the attempted attack, Badat was released early in return for agreeing to give evidence in trials in Britain and the US.

Badat had agreed to give evidence at Hamza’s trial from a secret location in the UK by CCTV.

But on Friday, the judge who will preside over Hamza’s trial, Katherine Forrest, asked Badat to fly to the US to give evidence.

He refused because he fears he will be arrested over the shoe bomb plot once he arrives in America.

If found guilty, 56-year-old Hamza – who uses a metal hook in place of his amputated hands – will spend the rest of his life in a maximum-security US jail.
