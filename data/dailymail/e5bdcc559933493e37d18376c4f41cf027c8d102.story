A father-of-one died after drinking a toxic pesticide which was sold to him as a weight loss aid, a court heard today.

Sean Cleathero, 28, was allegedly advised to dissolve a sachet of Dinitrophenol (DNP) in water, and then drink the mixture, at a gym in Buckinghamshire. He died later in hospital after being poisoned by the chemical.

Jamie Chivers, 44, Jason King, 41, and Peter Purkins, 47, are on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of manslaughter. All three deny the charge.

Victim: Sean Cleathero, 28, died after drinking Dinitrophenol (DNP), an industrial pesticide that is poisonous when consumed by humans, at a gym in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire on October 16 2012, a court heard

The court heard that Purkins and Chivers were co-owners of two businesses in High Wycombe - Precision Laboratories where the drug was produced, and Apollo Fitness, where Mr Cleathero collected and drank the lethal drug on October 16 2012.

King was their employee at the gym and it was alleged that he knew about the supply of DNP to Mr Cleathero.

He said Mr Cleathero, a member of the gym since March 2012, had previously been supplied with DNP pills.

But after complaining to Purkins that they were not working, Chivers dropped off an envelope containing DNP powder at the gym for the customer to collect.

Mr Price said the only warning Purkins offered to Mr Cleathero about the powder was: ‘It won’t taste any good’.

Chivers then dropped it off at the gym and King handed it over from behind the counter, advising him to dissolve it in a beaker of water before drinking, the prosecution said.

The jury was shown CCTV footage from the gym showing the victim drinking the bright yellow liquid and then start to sweat.

Prosecutor John Price QC said: 'The minute he drank the contents of that glass he was a dead man because there is no antidote for what he consumed.'

Accused: Peter Purkins (left) and Jason Chivers (right) were co-owners of two businesses - Precision Labratories, where the DNP was allegedly produced, and Apollo Fitness, where the drug 'was supplied'

Employee: King, an employee at Apollo Fitness allegedly handed Mr Cleathero a packet of the pesticide from behind the counter, advising him to dissolve it in a beaker of water before drinking

'He could not stop sweating even long after he had finished his workout and he was starting to struggle to breathe.'

An ambulance was called and Mr Cleathero was taken to Wycombe Hospital where he died eight hours after consuming the poison.

A post mortem examination showed the cause of death was poisoning by DNP. His temperature had soared to 42C - well above the average body temperature of around 37C - the court heard.

He said the gym had 'all the appearance of being a professional, well run and legitimate operation' but that was just 'a veneer'.

On trial: They appeared at the Old Bailey (pictured) today. The prosecutor said Purkins, King and Chivers were involved in the production and supply of DNP and they would have known 'the truth' of its potential dangers

Mr Price said that DNP was not a controlled drug and had a legitimate use as an insecticide or herbicide.

It is alleged that the three men knew about the potentially lethal effects of the pesticide when they sold it.

Mr Price added: 'It has a long history of misuse by humans as what is called a fat burner, as the name implies those who take it do so to assist in an attempt to lose weight,' he said.

Mr Price said Purkins, King and Chivers were involved in the production and supply of DNP to the public for personal consumption and they would have known 'the truth of it'.

In 2003, nine years before Mr Cleathero died, the Food Standards Agency had advised that DNP was 'extremely dangerous to human health' following an incident in Finland, the jury was told.

Chivers, Purkins and King, all from Buckinghamshire, along with Laura Hague, 23, of Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, deny charges of producing and supplying anabolic steroids.

King and Hague also deny perverting the course of justice by removing incriminating evidence after Mr Cleathero’s death.

The court was told Chivers has already admitted perverting the course of justice after he 'forgot' to delete CCTV footage showing him deleting incriminating footage from earlier in the week.

Purkins is not accused over the alleged cover up.

The trial continues.
