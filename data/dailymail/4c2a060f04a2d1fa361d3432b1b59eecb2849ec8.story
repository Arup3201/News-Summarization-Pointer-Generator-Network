Sentenced: Brenda Heist, 53, will spend a year in jail for violating her probation stemming from a February arrest for using a stolen ID

A mother of two who disappeared from her central Pennsylvania home in 2002 and was later declared legally dead before reemerging in Florida will spend a year in jail on a probation violation.

Brenda Heist, 54, who is known in the Santa Rosa County court system under the alias Kelsie Smith, was sentenced Tuesday.

She pleaded no contest to failing to check in with authorities in the Tampa area after leaving the Pensacola area following her April release from jail.

Heist had been on probation for using someone else's identification during a traffic stop, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

The 54-year-old woman left behind a husband and two children when she disappeared from her home outside Lititz, Pennsylvania, in February 2002 while going through an amicable divorce.

In 2010, Heist was declared legally dead. Then in April of this year, she turned herself in to deputies in Monroe County, Florida, and revealed she was a missing person.

The one-year jail sentence stems from a February 15 arrest for using an identification card during a traffic stop, which Heist had stolen from a Milton resident whose house she cleaned

Brenda Heist, who was eventually 
presumed dead by her husband and two children after suddenly going 
missing from their Pennsylvania home, walked into the Alachua County Jail in Gainsville, Florida, April 26 after violating her probation.

The
 54-year-old was released from jail in April after being arrested for 
drug possession and driving with an expired tag in Pinellas County, 
Florida.

Following her release, she did not report to her parole officer, according to WTSP leading to the warrant for her in Santa Rosa County.

Missing: The then 42-year-old was last seen dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania

It emerged last month that Heist had set up a new life as a Florida cleaner and never spoke about the family she left behind.

Heist's story has made headlines nationwide, leading to an appearance on Dr. Phil's talk show in late May. 

In an exclusive interview with Dr. Phil McGraw for Today Show, a tearful Heist dressed in orange prison garb begged for her family's forgiveness and attempted to justify her decision to disappear from their lives 11 years ago.

‘I just kept saying to myself, “They're better off without me,"' she said.

Following her resurfacing, friends have spoken of their 
shock at discovering who she actually was and lifted the lid on her 
runaway life which was far less tragic than she has made out. For a time
 she lived happily in Florida, making money as a cleaner and bookkeeper 
and living with friends. 

Pictures reveal her drinking, swimming and tanning with her new acquaintances to whom she never told her real story.

'We're learning now that life wasn't so bad for her in some of her 
friend's eyes, that are calling us today," Detective Sergeant Schofield,
 who is leading the investigation, told the Lancaster Online.

Sondra
 Forrester said: 'We were close, she was a friend, and we did things on 
weekends. We spent time at the beach, and fishing. She was around my 
three kids. She was very sweet. She called me sweetie. I felt bad for 
her. It sounded like she'd had a hard life. She said she was a widow, 
had no children, that her mother died when she was 6.'

Another friend who knew Heist as 'Lovie Smith' said she had no idea she was being deceived.

Heist worked as a cleaner in the Panhandle after hitch-hiking there with a pair of vagrants she ran into in the park.

She told police she was acting on a whim after suffering money problems and facing divorce.

When building her new life, she apparently told friends she had a husband who had died.

Brenda Heist has spoken for the first time about the circumstances that prompted her to just get up and leave her children more than 11 years ago

Heist told Dr. Phil that she now regrets having revealed herself after 11 years because it has re-opened old wounds for her children

She never revealed she 
had two children left to grow up thinking their mother may have been 
murdered.

'She didn’t want children, she didn’t like children and never had children. That’s what she told me,' the friend said.

'She spoke mostly about her husband and how much she really loved him and she was devastated that he died.'

It was through work as a cleaner that she stole another identity - 
lifting the driver's license of one of her housekeeping clients.

When the deception was discovered she moved on again.

Over the 11 years she is
 said to have three aliases.  She also went by Kelsei Smith and even 
served a short time in jail for identity theft when that was uncovered.

For
 a time, it seems she was homeless although where and when is unclear.  
Her real identity didn't emerge until she turned up at a Florida police 
station this week.

And as the news came out her family reacted in horror that they had been living a lie.

Shock: New friends of Heist were shocked to hear of her real identity and that she'd left her family 11 years before

All grown up: Morgan Heist, pictured with her brother Lee, has said she wishes she had never cried for her missing mom who has finally showed up after eleven years

Anger: Her children Morgan Heist, 19, and her brother Lee, 23, have reacted angrily to the news and say they want nothing to do with her

Her daughter, Morgan Heist, 19, took to Twitter to reveal how angry she was after realizing her mother had willfully left.

'This doesn't 
seem real. I feel like I'm in my own horrible nightmare and can't wake 
up.'

She also tweeted that she was glad her father was now exonerated of any blame or suspicion about his wife's disappearance.

'To every person who ever questioned my dads place in my moms dissapearance, (sic) take that.'

Heist was reported missing by 
her husband on February 8, 2002. The then 42-year-old was last seen that morning dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, 
Pennsylvania. Her car was found a few days later with no apparent sign of a struggle.

In April, she walked into Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in Key Largo, Florida, and announced who she was.

Heist has told detectives she left her family because the 
pressure was too much and she snapped.

She said she was sitting on a park bench and crying when she met a group of homeless people, who invited her to hitch-hike with them to Florida.

Disbelief: Former neighbor Arlene Bingeman said she couldn't believe Heist could have left her children for such a long time, while Detective Schofield noted that she had never tried to call home

When she disappeared, Heist's daughter 
was 8 and her son was 12. Her son recently graduated from West Chester 
University and is applying to a police academy in New Jersey. Her 
daughter is a sophomore at West Chester University.

'She said she thought of her family and her children every day, and her 
parents. However, she never acted on that and never made any phone calls
 – not one,' Lititz Police Detective John Schofield told 8WGAL.

She told police that she had decided to turn herself in because she was at the end of her rope and was having health 
problems. She now hopes to live with her mom in Texas.

'I can't believe that she would leave her two children,' former neighbor Arlene Bingeman told 8WGAL. 'I just can't, as a mother, I just can't believe that.'

Local, state and federal authorities spent months investigating Heist's disappearance in 2002, interviewing dozens of relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers. She was entered into several national missing persons databases.

Her husband eventually collected her life insurance policy in 2010.
