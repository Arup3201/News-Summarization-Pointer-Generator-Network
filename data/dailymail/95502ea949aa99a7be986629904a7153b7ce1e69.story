Two U.S. F16 fighter jets escorted a Panama-City bound plane back to Toronto on Friday and a SWAT team boarded the aircraft after a passenger reportedly threatened to blow up the plane.

Flight 772 turned around over West Virginia about 45 minutes after its 7 a.m. (1100 GMT) departure from Toronto Pearson International Airport, said Sunwing Airlines spokeswoman Janine Chapman. A 25-year-old Canadian man, Ali Shahi, was arrested when the plane landed back in Toronto.

Chapman said an 'agitated passenger directly threatened the aircraft' but did not elaborate on the threat.
