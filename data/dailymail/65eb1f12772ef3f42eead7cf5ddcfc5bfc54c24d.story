It is not a place you usually expect to see sandcastles, but Gatwick Airport has unveiled two giant sand sculptures in its terminals.

Created by renowned artist Zeus, the giant works are a celebration of the airport's expanded route network and depict New York's Chrysler Building and Dubai's sail-shaped, seven-star Burj Al Arab hotel.

Standing at six feet six inches tall, the sculptures celebrate the launch of Norwegian's new services to New York and Emirates' A380 flights to Dubai.

The works of art, which will be displayed for two months at the airport, will be viewed by around 7.5 million passengers expected to pass through Gatwick's terminals during the period.

Insights gathered from Gatwick's Airport Passenger Panel, an independent body set up to highlight potential improvements to the airport passenger experience, highlighted that UK airports needed more 'heart and soul'.

As a result, over the last few years Gatwick has invested in brightening its spaces and building its contemporary art collection.

In 2012, a 12-piece collection by the 'godfather of British pop art' Sir Peter Blake was installed across both Gatwick terminals offering passengers a warm, British welcome to the capital.

Last year, 'The People's Monarch' artwork was also installed, a single piece the size of a double decker bus, depicting the Queen but made up of 5,500 images of the people of South East England.

'Gatwick has invested over £1 billion in improving facilities and the airport experience in recent years,' said Spencer Sheen, head of retail at Gatwick airport.

'This transformation means more people and airlines than ever before are choosing to fly from Gatwick and many new routes are being opened.

'This latest addition to the airport's collection of artwork, creatively brings to life that Gatwick is now a world-class airport, serving over 200 destinations across the globe for both leisure and business travellers.'

Zeus, the artist for the two new sculptures, said: 'I am delighted that these two urban sculptures will be exhibited at London Gatwick, the inspiration for which was taken from two of the flagship cities Gatwick flies to – New York and Dubai.

'Airports are symbols of modern metropolises like London, so what better place to display the works where millions of passengers can see them.

'My aim is to give people passing through Gatwick's terminals a place to reflect before they travel and when they return home to London.'
