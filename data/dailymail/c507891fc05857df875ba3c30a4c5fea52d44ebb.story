VestGuard UK's Commercial Director, 
Oliver Lincoln, said: 'Traditionally we sold a lot of bulletproof 
clipboards back in the day of pen and paper.

'We noticed we weren't really selling many of them anymore and realised it was because everyone was using iPads and tablets.

'So we thought we'd give the iPad panel a try, and interest rocketed.We've sold more than 1,000 iPad panels to customers all over the world.

The panels have been designed to be small, thin and they weigh only 142g. They also don't obstruct the iPad's camera

'They're
particularly popular with VIPs, politicians and business people working
on their iPad in sensitive, dangerous environments.

'They'd
use the iPad panel as a last line of defence in Libya or Iraq if they 
didn't want to wear body armour or a bulletproof vest for the day.

'It might only be small but it's effective and the weight you're carrying around is negligible.

'You'd be surprised how many ordinary people have been purchasing the panels, particularly Londoners.'
