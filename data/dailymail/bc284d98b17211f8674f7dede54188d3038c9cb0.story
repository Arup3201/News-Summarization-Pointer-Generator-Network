Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has revealed the secret behind Fernando Torres' rejuvenated form… just a little hug.

Torres has scored two goals in four games since arriving back at Atletico on-loan, the club where it all began, following a less than successful spell with Chelsea.

The Spaniard shocked many when he grabbed a double against rivals Real Madrid away at the Bernabeu Stadium in just his third game back in Spain.

But Atletico manager Simeone certainly wasn't shocked by the Spaniard's brace. He said: 'I am not sure why anybody is surprised that he (Torres) is playing so well - I am not surprised at all.

'I knew I was getting one of the best strikers in Europe - and that is what we are seeing. He just needed a hug that was all.

'It does not matter if you are a kid in the youth team or playing in The Champions League - every player needs a coach to believe in him - and he knows that I do.

'I am excited about what he can achieve here, and I am excited about what we can achieve as a team again this season.

'It will be two tough games against Barcelona we know that - but this team has proved we can compete with Barcelona and Real Madrid - and now with addition of Torres it has given us even more options. '
