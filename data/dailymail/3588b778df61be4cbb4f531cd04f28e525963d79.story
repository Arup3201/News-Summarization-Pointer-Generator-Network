The site of the world's worst ever nuclear disaster has still not be cleared 28 years on as these bleak pictures show.

The photographs were taken by sales manager and photographer Toby Batchelor who travelled to the nuclear site at Pripyat, Chernobyl.

The 34-year-old of Derby spent two days in the city where a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl Power Station exploded on April 26, 1986.

During the accident itself, 31 people died and it has left devastating long term effects, such as cancer and deformities, which are still being accounted for.

Mr Batchelor said: 'Each day when leaving the area you had to be scanned for high levels of radioactivity.

'In my images we can see everything from the school littered with gas masks to the abandoned cottage of a resident.

'It is a very tense place to be, as you have to pass through a couple of heavily guarded check points where they check you off with their list of visitors.

'There is a lot of shock and general interest from people when they see these photographs. It is something that you just can't imagine happening.

'It was very sad to see places that would have once been full of people, but very interesting to learn about.'

As a result of lack of money, the project to clear the site is now ten years behind schedule and Ukraine's current political and economic meltdown could mean an even bigger delay is in store, with the intended finish of 2015 now out of reach.
