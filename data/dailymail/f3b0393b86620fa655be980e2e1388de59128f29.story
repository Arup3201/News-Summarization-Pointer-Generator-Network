Seattle Seahwaks head coach Pete Carroll has taken the blame for his controversial play call in the dying moments of the Super Bowl and said he didn't run the ball because he thought they had time to seal the win.

His team had the ball on the one-yard line, needing a touchdown to win the game with Marshawn Lynch, one of the league's best running backs, in the backfield.

Yet, instead of asking Lynch to try and make that yard, Seattle ran a passing play, with Russell Wilson trying to find receiver Ricardo Lockette.

Patriots corner Malcolm Butler read the situation perfectly, timed his move and made the interception to assure a fourth Super Bowl title for the Patriots. 

Explaining his decision he said they didn't want to run against their goal line defense and were planning on waiting until the third or fourth down to make the game-winning play. He therefore decided to 'waste' the play.

Dejected: Pete Carroll is facing a backlash after making what some have called the 'worst play call ever' in the dying moments of the Super Bowl

Determined: Russell Wilson responded to the criticism on Monday after taking some of the blame for the play

He said: 'Really what happened, it was frankly really clear, we went to three receivers and they sent in their goal line people. We had plenty of downs and a time out and didn't want to run against their goal line people right there.

'I told my guys that's my fault totally. We had plenty of time to win the game. We were playing for third or fourth down, but it didn't work out that way.'

The decision to pass rather than give the ball to Lynch was instantly criticized by former players and analysts.

'That was the worst play call I've seen in the history of football,' tweeted Hall of Fame running back and three-time Super Bowl winner Emmitt Smith.

Seahawks coach Pete Carroll was not surprisingly the man given the blame.

'That play call will haunt Pete for the rest of his career,' tweeted former Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens. 'Give the ball to Beastmode (Lynch) in that situation.'

Carroll said his thinking was that the Patriots had their run defense in place and with his wide receivers on the field, they were not well matched-up for a run play.

He added: 'It is a really clear thought but it didn't work out right. We happened to throw them the ball and they make a big play.

'At this time it seems like overthinking but they have extra guys at the line up scrimmage so we don't want to waste a run play on that,' he said.

'We make those decisions every game, all the time. They work out sometimes and they don't other times. This one didn't work out right for us.'

Wilson agreed.

'We had a good play. If it was a catch, it would be a completely different story. I thought it was going to be a touchdown when I threw it. I thought it was going to be game over,' he said.

Carroll said he and Wilson had shared a moment of disbelief at the end of the game.

'We just looked at each other trying to realize the gravity of what we just witnessed. We didn't say very much'.

Some of the Seahawk players however disagreed. Linebacker Bruce Irvin told NFL.com he did not understand the call as they have 'the best back in the league'.
