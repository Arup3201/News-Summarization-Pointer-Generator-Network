With a one-point lead, 2.9 seconds to play and possession of the ball, all Hugo High School had to do was inbound the basketball and run out the clock to advance in the Oklahoma state boys' basketball tournament.

But what followed stunned everyone.

Hugo guard Trey Johnson got confused after he received the inbounds pass and laid the ball into the wrong basket just before time expired.

It gave the opposing team, Millwood High, a 38-37 win on Thursday night and a place in the Class 3A semifinals.

'When I saw the kid going that way, I was like, "No, he's not. No, he's not ... Oh, yes he is,"' Millwood assistant coach David Samilton told The Oklahoman. 'I couldn't believe it.'

Trey needed only to dribble away the remaining seconds to wrap up a victory for Hugo.

Instead, he got turned around and dropped in a most bizarre buzzer-beater, Hugo coach Darnell Shanklin told The Associated Press on Friday.

Hugo's celebrating fans went silent, and Millwood fans broke out in celebration after a moment of silence for reassurance that the points - and the win - were theirs.

'Without a doubt, that's the toughest locker room I've ever had to talk to,' Mr Shanklin said.

Mistake: The basket seen being made by the 16-year-old junior gave the opposing team a 38-37 win on Thursday night and a place in the Class 3A semifinals

And the 16-year-old high school junior was tough to console, Mr Shanklin said, adding that other players on the team called and texted him on Friday offering their support.

'The kid feels terrible. It's still a game, regardless of what anyone says, basketball is still a game,' Mr Shanklin said.

With the win, Millwood advances to a semifinal matchup against two-time defending state champ, Centennial High.

'I feel sorry for him,' Mr Samilton said of Trey. 'I really do feel sorry for him. But hey, I'll take it.'

Mr Samilton wasn't alone in sharing Johnson's pain.

On Friday NBA general manager for the Oklahoma Thunder, Sam Presti, personally contacted the 16-year-old and invited him to Sunday's NBA game against the Boston Celtics, the Oklahoman reports.

Trey will attend as a guest of the team.

What Mr Presti and the student discussed remained under wraps but it could easily be assumed on line with his high school coach's shared words with the newspaper.

'He's a great kid, tremendous talent, and he'll do wonderful, wonderful things,' he said.
