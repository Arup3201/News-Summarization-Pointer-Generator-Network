'Willy Wonka': Rolf Harris has been handing out Mars Bars to inmates who play dominoes with him

Rolf Harris has been given the nickname Willy Wonka by fellow inmates because he hands out Mars Bars  to people who play games with him.

The 84-year-old paedophile is giving away chocolate during  dominoes matches - but is getting a reputation as a 'soft touch' with prisoners at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire.

Harris, who is serving five years and nine months for 12 indecent assaults on four girls as young as seven, has had a tough time since he was jailed in July as he has become a 'hate figure', one inmate said.

But it appears he is now handing out chocolate and tobacco as he seeks to make friends.

'He is in good spirits. He is playing lots of dominoes,' a source told The Sun.

'He even treats prisoners who don't have much cash to chocolate and cakes and tobacco.

'They call him Willy Wonka after the Roald Dahl character because he is a soft touch for a Mars Bar.'

Harris was attacked soon after arriving at Bullingdon and was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl - leaving him cowering in a pew.

The prisoner who went for him called him a 'dirty nonce' because his family had been targeted by a paedophile in the past.

Other angry inmates later claimed he 'queue jumped' after he was given a job in the prison's garden looking after the vegetable patch. 

But it has led to a charm offensive from the disgraced star and he started sketching cartoons for fellow inmates in an attempt to win them over

The Australian is reportedly handing out signed drawings to convicts who queue outside his cell in the hope of securing one of his sketches.

Treat: Mars bars and tobacco are now being given out by the star

One prisoner has claimed the entertainer turned down offers of cash for his drawings while other inmates have dubbed the drawing sessions 'Rolf's Prison Cartoon Club' in reference to his 1990s television programme.

The entertainer settles down to draw between 4.30pm and 6.30pm while prisoners are allowed to walk between cells.

The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court. 

He was jailed for his decades preying on victims including and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. He even attacked her as his daughter slept in the same room.

Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault.

He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction.

His multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.
