Any parent will tell you that life is their child's party and they'll cry if they want to- especially if they are made to do something they don't feel inclined to.

A hilarious new hashtag has popped up on social media site Instagram exposing some of these 'awful' that things parents do to their children- such as giving them a bath (how dare they), putting them in their high chair (so mean), and even giving them cookies (what a truly evil thing to do).

#a**holeparent has almost 4000 posts from parents all over world, admitting through their uploaded pictures to cleaning, feeding, and entertaining their children to their immense dissatisfaction.

'I wouldn't let her have a knife,' explained one parent on the #a**hole parent thread

Most of the photos show children crying, followed by an explanation of exactly what their parent has done to upset them so.

'I wouldn't let her have a knife,' explained one parent alongside a picture of their daughter sobbing in a highchair.

'I wouldn't let him drink the bubble solution, therefore I'm an #a**holeparent,' wrote another, next to a picture of more tears. 

The a**holeparent website features similar images, with children crying over the small details in life.

'I won't let her play with the dirty poop wipes in the trash can,' posted one parent.

'Because I was throwing a ball in old navy and she carried [it] out,' wrote another, next to an image of their child crying.

'Have you ever suggested your child eat a broken granola bar? Have you ever barred your child from playing with power tools?,' the description on the website says. 

'Have you ever served your child a drink from the pink cup when they wanted blue? Then you, too, might be an asshole parent.' 

One #a**holeparent posted a photo with their daughter curled up in the hallway crying.

'I stopped him from eating wood chippings at the park, so I am an #a**holeparent,' one image was captioned

'Asked her to model today's outfit... Apparently that makes me an #a**holeparent,' the social media user wrote.

'I put her on her rocking horse like she wanted...so im an #a**holeparent,' posted another parent.

'It’s a universal experience: having a small child be disappointed in something completely illogical,' the 'about us' section on the website says.

'Despite our best efforts, children are often frustrated. Sometimes they think we’re awful, when we’re really just being parents. May this be a humorous reminder that we’re all in this together.' 

'I'm an #a**holeparent because I made him sit in his highchair and read while I swept up the food on the floor'

'She made me see the easter bunny,' posted one parent captioning this image

'I stopped him from eating wood chippings at the park, so I am an #a**holeparent,' one image was captioned.

'I'm an #a**holeparent because I made him sit in his highchair and read while I swept up the food on the floor,' said another. 

The hashtag may be in response to or a spoof of the Instagram hashtag #parentingfails, which shows parents engaged in activities with their children that others have deemed unusual or inappropriate.

'He couldn't wait until we got home to play outside. So I'm an #a**holeparent'.
