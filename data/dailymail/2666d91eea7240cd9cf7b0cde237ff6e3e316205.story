Caroline Wozniacki overcame a stiff challenge from 18-year-old Taylor Townsend before sealing her place in the second round of the Australian Open.

Wozniacki was pushed hard in the first set by the young American but eventually went on to secure a 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory to progress to the last 64.

After losing the final of the US Open to good friend Serena Wiliams last September, former world No 1 Wozniacki is still bidding to win a maiden Grand Slam.

Her first match in Melbourne was a tough test against rising star Townsend, who two years ago was controversially asked by the United States Tennis Association to sit out of the US Open junior event due to her weight.

But Townsend has put that behind her to climb into the top 100 and she further showed her future promise by providing a tough test for Wozniacki on the Margaret Court Arena.

The pair exchanged breaks in the first set before Townsend got tight in the tiebreak and Wozniacki took advantage to move a set ahead.

Wozniacki then made just four unforced errors in the second set as she went on to wrap up the win in one hour and 32 minutes.

It sets up a blockbuster second-round match on Thursday between Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka, who has won the title here twice in the last three years but is unseeded due to her long layoff last year with a foot injury.
