A restaurant in the U.S. is breaking all the rules about politics never being discussed at the dinner table by only serving food from countries considered enemies of America.

Conflict Kitchen, which is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, features a rotating menu of takeaway food from countries where diplomatic relations with the U.S. are tense. 

Dishes on sale are currently from Venezuela - whose oil-rich left-wing government is openly hostile to the U.S. - but past menus included traditional food from North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan and Cuba.

Appetite for destruction: Conflict Kitchen has previously hosted a purely North Korean menu - including this plate of seafood and scallion pancakes, spicy braised rice cakes and tofu pockets stuffed with rice

Debate: As well as serving-up great-looking food, Conflict Kitchen also helps educate diners about the country in question and explains the political, cultural and historical context of tensions with the U.S.

Whenever the menu changes to incorporate dishes from another 'hostile' nation, so too does the restaurant's decor - bringing a flavour of a foreign nation to the local area, as well as to the food.

All the dishes currently being served at Conflict Kitchen are Venezuelan-themed, with the menu including cheese empanadas served with a traditional South American variant on guacamole, various plantain-based snacks and slow-cooked coconut goat with fried green banana mash.

The non-profit restaurant began life as an art project, and is still partially funded by grants from Carnegie Mellon University.

It recently moved from an open-window takeaway service to a full restaurant with outdoor seating in the centre of Pittsburgh.

The owners say Conflict Kitchen's main goal is to raise awareness of world issues and create delicious food, not to make money, so prices are surprisingly low considering the exotic ingredients.

Small dishes rarely cost more than $3, with main meals no more than $7.50.

As well as receiving a meal, customers picking up a takeaway are treated to an information pack about the food's country of origin, with all members of staff fully-trained to answer any additional questions inquisitive diners might have.

When the restaurant focused on North Korea food late last year - with dishes such as traditional vegetable stews, cold buckwheat noodles and spicy rice cakes filling the menu - they were served with a booklet of interviews given by those who have been able to escape the highly secretive state.

Similar handouts were previously given to
 Conflict Kitchen customers purchasing food such as an Afghan-themed 
pumpkin, spinach and lentil pie, or an Iranian lamb and steamed rice 
stew.

Another gimmick saw 
customers invited to eat their meal wearing a head-set that connected 
them with a person in Iran who was also eating.

The pair were then encouraged to chat, as if they were having lunch with one another.

Speaking to ABC News, co-founder Jon Rubin - who also works as an associate professor in the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon University - said Conflict Kitchen is helping to bring new dishes to a fairly closed community.

'It was an experiment that was based 
on what many people thought was an incredibly bad business model to sell
 food to people in the city, from countries that have no cuisine on our 
local landscape,' Mr Rubin said.

'In
 some ways, [it] was a response to what I felt wasn't in this city, 
which was a lot of cultural and ethnic diversity, and also a sense of 
being part of an international, global conversation,' he added.

Conflict Kitchen has become so popular that it is starting to run into problems.

For
 example, so many customers now want to stop and chat about the food and
 the country it came from that staff are struggling to keep up with 
demand while also dealing with ever-growing queues.

'Since
 we've become so popular, people aren't able to take the time to stand 
at the takeout window and talk with our staff, who have been trained to 
have these discussions, to basically be good listeners and 
conversationalists about the politics and culture,' co-founder Dawn 
Weleski said.
