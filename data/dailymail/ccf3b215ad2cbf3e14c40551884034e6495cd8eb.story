Two major U.S. air carriers are being at risk of hefty fines after their customers were stranded for seven hours as runways turned into a ski slope over the weekend.

It was a nightmare near Hartford, Connecticut, as passengers on six JetBlue planes and one American Airline plane say they were stranded on the tarmac at Bradley International Airport for seven hours or more.

They were being diverted from New York-area airports on Saturday - and the ordeal continued after they were let off and had to spend the night on beds and chairs in terminals.

Blizzard: Passengers were left tired and angry after being kept on board a JetBlue flight at Bradley International Airport for seven hours. Snow had made conditions difficult

Under the so-called tarmac delay rules put in place last year, both airlines, could be slapped with a fine of $27,000 per passenger, MarketWatch reported, a whopping $18,900,000 for JetBlue alone.

A passenger on one of the diverted 
JetBlue planes says the crew ran out of snacks and bottled water for the
 last few hours of the delay.

‘The toilets were backed up,’ said 
Florida newspaper reporter Andrew Carter, who was traveling to cover the
 Miami Dolphins against the New York Giants. ‘When you flushed, nothing 
would happen.’

His plane took off from Fort 
Lauderdale for Newark Liberty International at around 9am. After being 
diverted to Hartford, the plane sat on the tarmac between around 1:30pm 
and 9pm, he said.

A JetBlue spokesman said six of its 
planes, carrying a total of about 700 passengers, were diverted to 
Hartford as a result of a ‘confluence of events’.

These included equipment failures at 
Newark and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport that 
prevented planes from landing in low visibility.

The JetBlue spokesman declined to 
specify how long the planes sat on the tarmac at Bradley, but noted that
 17 other flights with different carriers were also diverted to the 
airport.

Frustrated: Passengers were left without food, water or working bathrooms and journalist Andrew Carter, pictured second row on right with his head turned, Tweeted his annoyance

Once the planes landed at Bradley, the
 JetBlue spokesman said that intermittent power outages at the airport 
made refuelling and deplaning difficult.

Kate Hanni, of FlyersRights.org, said 
she got calls and emails from passengers and worried family members 
regarding at least four flights that were stranded on the tarmac for up 
to 10 hours.

Brent Stanley and his wife were on one
 of those planes, an American Airlines flight that had originally been 
headed to JFK after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.

After being diverted and landing in 
Hartford at 2:30pm, Mr Stanley said passengers were given various 
reasons for being held on the tarmac.

These included the need to refuel and de-ice and the airport's limited capacity for handling international flights.

He and his wife were eager to get back
 home to their two young sons in Lake Zurich, Illinois. But they 
realised they didn't have it as bad as the parents who had infants on 
the plane.

Fury vented: Mr Carter, a reporter with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on the flight to cover a football game in New Jersey, kept his followers updated while on board

‘There was a lady in front of us with 
an 18-month-old daughter,’ Mr Stanley said. ‘Another woman came by to 
borrow diapers because we couldn't get to our luggage.’

After spending the night at the 
airport, Mr Stanley was lucky to find two seats on Sunday on an 
afternoon flight home to Chicago.

But the headache is not over yet as 
his luggage was headed to JFK because the Hartford airport crew wasn't 
able to handle international luggage, Mr Stanley said.

An American Airlines spokesman said the passengers weren't allowed off the plane by customs at the airport.

In a recording obtained by LiveATC.net, the pilot on the JetBlue flight from Fort Lauderdale was forced to call for police back-up when passengers grew hostile.

He said: 'I got a problem here on the airplane, I'm gonna need to have the cops on board. There's a cop car sitting in front of me right here right now.

'I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane.'

Passengers: Mr Carter, left, was exhausted after the ordeal, while a passenger who would only identify himself as Robert, right, said he was furious

Matt Shellenberger, who was on a 
JetBlue flight from Boston to JFK, said his plane was diverted to 
Bradley International and sat on the tarmac for seven hours.

The crew picked up rubbish regularly and handed out water and snacks and ‘everyone held their cool,’ he said.

But his frustrations grew with each status update - as the reasons for the delay kept changing as the hours passed.

Early on, passengers were told that 
the plane was just being refuelled and would fly out soon, he said. Then
 they were told it was being de-iced. Then there was an emergency on 
another plane.

‘We were told we were the third plane 
in line to get to the gate when we landed,’ he said. ‘Then we stayed on 
the plane for seven hours.’

Mr Carter of the Sun Sentinel 
newspaper in Florida, who was on another JetBlue flight, reported a 
similar sequence of updates.

'Lady on board just broke down,' he tweeted at one point. 'Like that guy who cried in his cell at the beginning of Shawshank. Can someone sneak me in Rita Hayworth?'

The saga continued long after 
passengers were let off the plane.

The power outages from storms in 
Connecticut made booking hotel rooms difficult. As a result, many 
passengers just slept at the airport, Mr Carter and Mr Shellenberger 
said separately.

Help required: Passengers on board dialled 911 after hours of being told they couldn't leave. Fire and police crews arrived

When they awoke, hundreds of passengers had to wait in line for hours just to figure out which flight they would be on.

‘That was most disappointing part,’ Mr Carter said. ‘It seemed like there was no plan when we got off the plane.’

In the morning, Mr Carter said he and 
several other passengers rented a van to drive to New Jersey rather than
 wait for the afternoon flight JetBlue had scheduled to Newark.

It's not the first time JetBlue has had problems with tarmac delays.

The New York-based airline also made 
headlines in 2007 when snow and ice storms stranded its planes for 
nearly 11 hours at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Such high-profile delays helped prompt
 a regulation last year that fines airlines for holding domestic flights
 on the tarmac for more than three hours.

This year, the rule was extended to apply to international flights that are held on the tarmac for more than four hours.

Still delays: Stranded passengers rested on cots at Bradley International Airport, a day after the snowstorm in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, forced them to stay on board the plane

However the Department of 
Transportation often doesn't enforce the fines to their full extent 
unless delays are extreme. Passengers also do not get a cut of the 
fines.

Low-cost carriers are more prone to 
tarmac delays because letting passengers off planes can cost an airline a
 lot of money, said Ms Hanni of FlyersRights.org.

If a plane is diverted because of a 
reason within the airline's control, such as a mechanical failure, 
ticket contracts usually state that passengers will be reimbursed for 
hotels, food and transportation.

That means airlines do everything in 
their power to keep passengers on board in hope that the plane will be 
able to take off again.

JetBlue said that passengers who were diverted to Bradley International would be reimbursed for their fares and hotel expenses.

A spokesman for the Port Authority of 
New York & New Jersey, which oversees Newark and JFK airports, could
 not say how many flights were diverted because of equipment failures.
