Insensitive: NBC's Bob Costas noted a controversy over honoring Israeli athletes killed at the Olympics 40 years ago during his coverage of the opening ceremony a the London Olympics, but stopped short of offering his own protest

NBC's Bob Costas noted a controversy over honouring Israeli athletes killed at the Olympics 40 years ago during his coverage of the opening ceremony but stopped short of offering his own protest.

The International Olympic Committee had declined a request to hold a moment of silence during the ceremony to acknowledge the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian gunmen in Munich in 1972.

Costas called that decision insensitive during an interview this month and indicated he would call for his own moment of silence when Israeli athletes marched into the Olympic Stadium on Friday.

Costas' comments took his bosses by surprise. Jim Bell, executive producer of the NBC's telecast, said this week that Costas hadn't brought it up with him before the interview.

As the athletes marched in Friday, Costas said that IOC President Jacques Rogge led a moment of silence for the late Israelis this week before about 100 people at the Athlete's Village.

'Still, for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died,' Costas said.

After a five-second pause, NBC cut to a commercial.

The network has been under fire by many who were upset the U.S. network, which has exclusive rights to broadcasting in America.              
Cut from NBC: Scottish singer Emeli Sande performs a moving rendition of Abide With Me in memory of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings at the Olympics Opening Ceremony

NBC said in a statement: 'We are live streaming every sporting event, all 32 sports and all 302 medalsâ€¦ The opening and closing ceremonies, however, are entertainment spectacles.

'Our award-winning production team will present them on a medium that best demonstrates their grandeur and majesty, and at a time when friends and family are able to gather together to watch, which is in prime time.'

Britons are also fuming that tributes to victims of the 7/7 attacks were combined in a general memorial, and not given their own moment of silence.

Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, which promotes Jewish causes, said he appreciated Costas bringing up the issue, though he didn't expect a moment of silence.

Moving montage: The faces of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the victims of 7/7, were flashed up on big screens around the Olympic Stadium and on TV

In their memory: Those shown on the big screens included the late fathers of Danny Boyle, the opening ceremony's director, and London 2012 chief Lord Coe

'He established a sense of history and decency and sensitivity, I would say, in the tradition of Jim McKay,' Foxman said.

The late McKay is the former ABC sports caster who anchored coverage of the 1972 attack.

But the song was edited out of NBC's coverage in favour of a bland Ryan Seacrest interview with Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, it was reported on Deadspin.com.

Twitter very quickly became awash with comments demanding to know why the broadcaster had chosen that moment to break away from proceedings.

Scott Carruthers said: 'NBC cut tribute to the 7/7 victims from #olympicceremony coverage, shocking considering we honour the 9/11 victims at every opportunity.'

Dave Hogg tweeted: 'NBC skilled a tribute to servicemen and the 7/7 victims to show Seacrest interviewing Phelps. That's horrendous'.

Furious: Viewers took to Twitter to voice their disgust at NBC's decision to cut the tribute from its coverage

Angry: Many viewers were demanding to know why NBC chose to cut an entire performance, particularly such an emotive one

Meanwhile, Tamsin Wood said: 'So NBC 
cut out our tribute to the 7/7 victims for a stupid interview!! Rude and
 disrespectful on so many levels!! #openingceremony.'

NBC
 is known for cutting away for small portions of the opening ceremonies 
to make way for commercial, but U.S. commentators say they have never 
heard of it skipping a whole performance before.

The
 memorial was a moving section on a night full of pomp, humour and high 
drama that got the Greatest Show On Earth up and running in truly 
British style.

The BBC 
introduced the segment by saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, please pause 
silent for our memorial wall for friends and family who can't be here 
tonight.

'The excitement of that moment in Singapore seven years ago when England won the games was tempered the next day with sorrow from the events of July 7 that year. A wall of remembrance for those no longer here to share in this event.'

The big screens then showed a montage of images of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the late fathers of Danny Boyle, the show's director and London 2012 chief Lord Coe.

Dancers dressed in red, representing the struggle between life and death, were picked out by a spotlight in the darkness of the stadium as the powerful vocals of Sande pierced the air with Abide With Me.

This was followed by the procession of the 204 countries taking part and the lighting of the cauldron to signal the start of the Games.
