Footage of some of Britain's most important court judgements are to be uploaded on YouTube shortly after proceedings finish from this week.

Rulings of judges presiding over the Supreme Court, the UK's most powerful court, will be shown on the website for the first time after a successful trial run which saw live web footage of proceedings shown through Sky News.

The move will mean that, unlike during the trial, clips of the five minute judgements will be available to view at a later date.

Court president Lord Neuberger hopes that the videos will explain the reasoning behind rulings.

He told The Times that demand for the Sky News stream had far exceeded expectations with around 20,000 people logging on to watch each month.

Supreme Court spokesman Ben Wilson said: 'The idea is partly so that the judgements will be available online for law students, professionals and anyone interested in the outcome of an appeal to watch at their convenience.

'But it is also very much about trying to reach a wider and younger audience.'

The videos, which will be a five minute summary of each case written by its lead judge, will be published on YouTube from next Wednesday.

They will feature a brief outline of the case, and reasons for the judges decision.

Lord Neuberger has asked for clarity in rulings to ensure that judgements are accessible to all.

He said: 'We hope this new service will open up another window on our work and the reasoning behind our decisions, and broaden our audience.'

As well as judgements from this year, an archive of 25 cases from 2012 will also be uploaded to the court's dedicated YouTube channel.

Three judgements are expected on Wednesday.

Videos will be available by lunchtime.

The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in the UK and helps to shape British law.

It was formed in 2009 when judicial authority was moved away from the House of Lords.

The Supreme Court says that it currently has no plans to record and upload proceedings in their entirety.
