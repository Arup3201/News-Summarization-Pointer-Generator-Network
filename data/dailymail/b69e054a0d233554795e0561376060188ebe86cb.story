Caleo was charged with solicitation to commit murder, accessory before the fact to murder and accessory after the fact to murder, and remanded in custody.

Detectives investigating the murders during the 1990s had several leads on who might want to kill the victims, who were the children of a senior Malaysian police officer and whose deaths attracted considerable media coverage there and in Australia.

The inquest was also told about a property dispute between Dr Chye, his sister and her husband over a $3.6 million house in southern Sydney.

Ms Caleo's inquest was told that in the months leading up to her death, Ms Caleo had feared she might be killed and had given her solicitor a sealed envelope, on which she had written, 'to be opened only if my death is unnatural'.

Following her murder, police read a note in which she listed the names of two people she said had organised the execution-style murder of her brother.
