Set of demands: Police say 15 protesters entered the lobby reading a list of demands including one that Officers Flannery and Hayes be fired immediately

Police say 15 protesters entered the lobby reading a list of demands.

They asked for a meeting with Chief Sam Dotson, Mayor Francis Slay or Board of Aldermen President, Lewis Reed, reports Fox. 

The mob posted mock eviction notices outside of the police building.

'We are informing you that the police department is scheduled to be reclaimed by its citizens today, December 31, 2014,' said the notice.

Police attempted to remove the protesters from the building and even used pepper spray on some.

'We’re a public building, we’re open. But we’re open for legitimate business. We’re not open for people to come in and push their own agendas and disrupt the business that has to go on here,' said Police chief Sam Dotson.

Protesters were tiffed by the police's use of pepper spray claiming things escalated too quickly.

In neighboring Ferguson, Missouri, police officers were shot at on Tuesday night, as they tried to investigate a burglary call at one of the town's many buildings burned down in anti-cop riots. 

Officers were called to the shell of the old Beauty Town store on West Florissant Avenue on Tuesday night around 6pm, and found several suspects stealing hair products from the building's basement. 

While trying to arrest the suspects, the officers heard gunfire coming from the Park Ridge Apartments located behind the store.  

Pushing back the crowd: Protesters planned to occupy the department for four and a half hours until their demands were met, one of which include amnesty for protesters charged with non-violent offenses.

They ducked for cover and then heard another round of fire coming from another location across the street. 

'It was a volley of rounds,' Ferguson police Sgt Harry Dilworth told St Louis Post-Dispatch.

They called for back-up and 15 to 20 minutes later, the area was cleared out and no one was injured.

A search of the area did not result in any weapons or suspects being found. 

Police do not believe the shooting was planned. 

The six looters arrested at the scene were charged with attempted burglary. 

The suburb of St Louis has been embroiled in turmoil ever since local teen Michael Brown was shot dead this past summer in an altercation with police officer Darren Wilson.

Tensions in the community became even more heated in November, when a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on any charges related to the teen's killing. 

The night the grand jury decision was announced, rioters took to the streets of Ferguson and burned down about a dozen buildings and destroyed ever more cars as police tried to combat the crowd with tear gas. 

Beauty Town was one of the several stores destroyed in the fire and looting, and the owner has set up a fund to raise money to rebuild. 

So far the fund has raise $6,015 of its $30,000 goal.
