The grieving husband of a Las Vegas mother shot dead following a road rage incident has come out in defense of his son, who police now say accompanied his mother with gun in hand to help search for the man who eventually killed her.

'My son is not an animal,' Robert Meyers told mourners at a Tuesday vigil for his wife Tammy Meyers. 'My son is a hero in my book.'

'There were mistakes made like every one of us have made in our life, but this particular mistake was made to keep a bigger mistake from happening.'

Defended son: Robert Meyers defended his son, who chased down an angry motorist in Las Vegas who subsequently shot and killed his Mr Meyers' wife Tammy

'My son is not an animal,' Robert Meyers said at the Tuesday vigil for Tammy Meyers. 'My son is a hero in my book'

Searched for driver: Police now say 44-year-old Tammy Meyers had her teenage daughter run in the house to fetch her armed son Brandon (seen here at the vigil), who then went with her as she drove to find the driver

In a change from earlier accounts, police Lt. Ray Steiber said 44-year-old Tammy Meyers had her teenage daughter run in the house to fetch her armed son, who then went with her as she drove to find the driver who had earlier stopped his car in front of hers, got out and approached her with angry words. 

His son, Brandon Meyers, also defended himself at his mother's vigil, reports NBCLA.

'I did what I had to do to protect my family. Everyone can think what they have to think; I did it for a reason. And I'd do it for anyone I love,' Brandon Meyers said. 

When asked to characterize Tammy Meyers' five-to-10 minute drive through the neighborhood, Lieutenant Steibner said Tuesday that police in the investigation 'would never say that anybody went looking for trouble,'

Dozens gathered in the parking lot at Johnson Junior High School, where police said Meyers was giving her daughter driving lessons on Thursday night before a near-collision led to the deadly confrontation

No one has been arrested in the killing, and the family is offering a 1965 Chevrolet El Camino as a reward in exchange for information leading to catching Tammy Meyers' killer

Armed: Brandon Meyers fired shots at the fleeing car with his handgun as his mother lay dying nearby

Son: Brandon Meyers, 22, posted a photo of a Beretta handgun (right) to his Facebook page one year ago, saying: 'New addition to the family.' Police say he shot at the fleeing car after his mom was gunned down

He said she found, and for a time followed, the vehicle she had apparently been looking for.

Tammy Meyers then drove home, Steiber said, where a vehicle described only as a four-door gray or silver sedan pulled up and someone inside opened fire.

'Unfortunately I cannot say what was in Tammy's mind,' the police lieutenant said. 'Tammy is the victim.'

Steiber said the initial road rage incident happened while Tammy Myers drove slowly home from a school parking lot, where she had been teaching her teenage daughter to drive. The girl didn't have a learner's permit. 

Steiber said the daughter told police a car sped up to them from behind and then pulled alongside. The daughter reached over from the passenger seat and honked the car horn at the car as it passed. 

Suspect: A twenty-something man with spiky hair, while Kristal Meyers holds a candle during a memorial vigil for her mother on Tuesday night

Shot dead: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, went home first before heading back out to find the man that eventually killed her following a road rage incident last Thursday, police say

Killed: Tammy Meyers - seen here with her husband Robert Meyers - went out looking for a man she had a road rage argument with, cops said. She was accompanied by their son Brandon, 22, who brought a gun with him, according to authorities

'She figured this person was speeding, and right or wrong, they needed to be corrected,' Steiber said of the girl, who he said is 15. 'She honked the horn.'

Steiber pointed to a police artist's sketch of a man sought for questioning. He said the man is believed to be in his mid-20s with blond hair and blue or hazel eyes, and was wearing a V-neck T-shirt.

'All indications to us are that this unknown person fired first,' Steiber said. He said Brandon Meyers returned fire.

Tammy Meyers was behind her son, and Steiber said police don't believe he was responsible for the fatal shot.
