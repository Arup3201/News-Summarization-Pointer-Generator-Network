Liverpool and England defender Glen Johnson fears the club may try to sell him in January as manager Brendan Rodgers shows no inclination to offer the 30-year-old defender a new contract.

Johnson’s current deal on an estimated £100,000-a-week runs out at the end of the season and he has yet to hear from the club about a renewal.

Rodgers brought in two Spanish full-backs Javier Manquillo and Alberto Moreno in the summer and Johnson is virtually resigned to not be offered a new contract despite being settled personally on Merseyside after signing for Rafa Benitez in 2009.

With Liverpool one of several clubs under investigation by Uefa for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, Rodgers shipped out other Benitez high-earners Pepe Reina and Daniel Agger in the last window.

The Anfield club would love to recoup some money on Johnson in the January transfer window although the player would be entitled to run down his contract and become a free agent in the summer.

He is free to speak to overseas clubs in the New Year if he wanted to emulate his former England colleague Ashley Cole who has joined Serie A club Roma on a Bosman.

Johnson has recently returned to action after missing six weeks with a thigh injury and comes up against his former manager Harry Redknapp today (Sunday) as Liverpool travel to QPR.

The right-back, capped 54 times by his country, won the FA Cup with Portsmouth under Redknapp in 2008 and has sympathy for his old boss who is expected to get the sack if Liverpool win at Loftus Road.

‘I don’t think there’s anyone like him,’ said Johnson. ‘I’ve worked with some very good managers but Harry’s like your mate. That’s why he gets a lot out of players.

‘He gets more out of certain people just by making you feel welcome and looking after people every day.

‘Of course it’s disappointing if he’s under pressure. It’s not nice to see anyone maybe losing their job, certainly not someone like Harry. He’s been a fantastic manager for years and if anyone is going to get QPR out of trouble it will be him, so I don’t know what sacking him would achieve.

‘He’s always been a fantastic manager for me and one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met. When I asked to leave Chelsea and went to Portsmouth, Harry was a big help to me. He gave me the chance to play every week and that’s what young players need to do.

‘When I had a dip in form, Harry put a nice little video together, which made a few of the lads laugh. It was good banter but it made me realise what I should be doing and I was able to crack on. Sometimes simple things like that can make a big difference.’

After last season’s unexpected Premier League title challenge, Liverpool have lost three of their four away games so far this season and struggled to cope with the loss of Luis Suarez and injury to Daniel Sturridge, who is out for a further month with a calf injury.

Johnson admits balancing domestic football with a busy Champions League schedule has been difficult to come to terms with.

‘We only had the Premier League to concentrate on last season while the other so-called top-four teams were playing games every four days. It was easier to keep everyone fit and we almost had our best eleven every week.

‘With the game load this season, it is not going to be as simple. You will get more injuries and hard to have all the squad out on the training ground. We haven’t picked as many results as when we started last season but that is down to the amount of games and losing a few bodies.’

Liverpool have a glamour European fixture coming up against Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday but Johnson says they can’t afford to think about that yet.

He added: ‘We have to treat the next game against QPR as the priority. We have to make sure we win that and then we can concentrate on Madrid. We have to do just as well in the league as we have in the Champions League.’
