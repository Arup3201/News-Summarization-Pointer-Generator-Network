Manchester United have decided not to send Marcos Rojo for surgery on his dislocated shoulder, meaning the Argentina defender could be back in action within six weeks.

It was feared that Rojo could be sidelined for up to three months after he was carried off in the second half of last weekend’s Manchester derby.

Manager Louis van Gaal confirmed that United hope to cure the problem with rest, but admitted that there is a worry that Rojo could suffer a recurrence of the dislocation in future.

Manchester United's Marcos Rojo could return within six weeks after dislocating his shoulder

‘Marcos Rojo dislocated his shoulder but he did it in the right way, a positive way, so we don’t need to operate and that is a relief,’ said Van Gaal.

‘Because it’s a conservative way it can be less than six weeks and when we have to operate it’s 12 weeks.

‘Maybe with this injury it is very difficult that it won’t happen again, and that’s the problem. Yesterday another specialist said that the conservative way to heal it is the best. But we have always the risk it will happen again.

‘It’s always the same with this injury, I cannot change that. The human body has been made by God not by me.’

With Chris Smalling suspended and Jonny Evans (ankle) and Phil Jones (shin splints) still injured, Van Gaal refused to confirm if Michael Carrick will play in central defence at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.

The England midfielder filled in as an emergency centre-back when Smalling was sent off in the defeat at Manchester City and finished the game playing alongside Paddy McNair following Rojo’s injury.

‘I don’t want to say what I’m thinking to do,’ added the United boss. ‘Smalling is not playing because he is suspended, and Jones and Evans are still injured. I have to solve that problem. Who is playing there I don’t want to say. Maybe I can train today and change my mind, because I have to solve that problem.

Van Gaal also defended his team’s defensive record, claiming that it has been blemished by the 5-3 defeat at Leicester in September.

‘I don’t agree with the opinion about the defence,’ he said. ‘When you don’t count the five goals of Leicester City, we have (conceded) less than Chelsea I believe. The balance of the team is the problem. That is why I have remodelled the structure of my team for the third time.’

United’s injury problems also mean that Radamel Falcao will also miss his third game in a row with a calf strain. The Colombia striker started his last game, the 2-2 draw at West Brom last month, on the bench but Van Gaal denied that he is losing faith in a player who could end costing United in excess of £50million if they make his loan move from Monaco permanent.

‘The problem for Falcao is that because of the balance in the (West Brom) game, I had to change and after that moment he has come in the game and assisted for a goal. Then in a training session he has been injured.

‘I cannot judge him now because now he is injured and I have changed him (left him out) not because of his performance but because the balance of the team. The team is more important than the individual.’
