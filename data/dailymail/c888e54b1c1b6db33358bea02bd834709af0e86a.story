The Church of England is advertising for low-paid jobs, including three at Canterbury Cathedral, the seat of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby 

The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy for demanding a minimum 'Living Wage' of £7.85, despite offering potential staff as little as £6.50 per hour. 

In an unprecedented intervention into the general election campaign last week, Church leaders hit out at the 'burgeoning' poverty of people in work and said it 'backed the concept of a Living Wage.'

The letter, which sparked a political row, also rallied against the market economy, consumerism, and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher.

But it has now emerged that a string of churches are advertising for jobs at the lowest possible legal minimum wage, which is currently £6.50. 

Among those advertising for the low-paid jobs is Canterbury Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, which is recruiting two kiosk assistant vacancies for £6.70.

The third low-paid job which has been advertised at Canterbury Cathedral is for a kitchen porter, who would be paid £7.75 per hour. 

Other cathedrals offering less than the Living Wage are Lichfield Cathedral and Pickering Church.  

A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: 'They should practise what they preach. It is hypocritical of them to admonish others when they don't seem to be able to put their own house in order.'

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke added: 'It's astonishing that the Church of England can call for the Living Wage to be paid by employers but don't pay it themselves.' 

Elsewhere in the UK, a listing on the Lichfield diocese website says it is looking for a 'cook/chef' who would work on a pro-rata salary of £11,830-£13,650. If the person works the full 25 hours a week, they would be paid between £6.50 and £7.50 per hour.

The cathedral is also advertising for waiting staff under a listing entitled 'Casual Waiting-On Staff (National Minimum Wage)'. The advert asks for candidates with previous waiting experience, who are willing to cover weekday, weekend and Bank Holiday shifts.  

Meanwhile, an advert posted by the Diocese of York is offering £7.65 to a pastoral worker at Pickering Church - 20p less than the Living Wage. 

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said today: 'It's embarrassing, of course, I won't say otherwise.

'But in the light of transparency, which I welcome, I will say we are a complex institution and every parish church and cathedral is an independent charity, as is every diocese.

'We don't have a centralised method of control. I'm not very keen on centralised control where, from far away, you tell people what to do.'

He said change to a living wage would come 'gradually', because each of the independent charities lacked the resources to move more quickly.

He added: 'As charities they have to do that gradually. You'll see that - and you'll see the accusations of hypocrisy, but make up your own mind as to what it is.'

A spokesman for the Church of England said it had been 'at the forefront' of campaigning for the Living Wage. But she admitted that every parish, diocese and cathedral reaches its own decision on pay, because each is a separate legal entity.

The spokesman added: 'The vast majority of those employed by or sub-contracted to the central institutions are already paid at least the Living Wage and all will be by April 2017.'

Canterbury Cathedral said that it is committed to introducing the Living Wage when 'economically feasible' and said 'well over half' of the staff were paid at least the Living Wage.

The letter from the House of Bishops,  published last week, was criticised as being a 'shopping list' of left-wing demands, which led to ministers mocking the 'dwindling relevance' of the Church's bishops.

They called for 'new direction' in politics to replace a society that they said is self-interested, fragmented and badly led by politicians.

Referring to 'in-work poverty', the letter read: 'We have seen the burgeoning of in-work poverty - people cannot earn enough to live decently.

Another listing on the site asks for an experienced cook/chef who would be earning between £6.50 and £7.50 per hour 

'This is why the Church of England has backed the concept of the Living Wage - an agreement with employers to ensure that all their staff earn a modest hourly rate that is sufficient for a full time worker to live decently.'

The Church insisted that the letter was meant to counter the message – promoted by comedian Russell Brand – that taking part in politics is useless. The bishops claimed their intention was not to tell people how to vote.

But the 'letter to the people and parishes of the Church of England' suggested inequality and social injustice had increased under the Coalition.

They said the burden of austerity has fallen on the poor and that worklessness is 'corrosive of human dignity and sense of identity'. 

The document, published in the name of the CofE's 51-member House of Bishops, called for continued membership of the EU, a re-think of the nuclear deterrent, and the end of the first-past-the-post voting system.

The bishops also declared that there has been 'an ugly undercurrent of racism in every debate about immigration' and said that to cut the international aid budget would be 'globally irresponsible'.

The letter, entitled Who Is My Neighbour?, called for a new vision in politics to move the country on from the welfare state introduced by Labour after 1945 or Lady Thatcher's drive to break the grip of the unions after 1979.

It criticised the welfare state because voluntary efforts were 'marginalised' and because 'dependence on state provision can undermine individual initiative and responsibility'.

However, it directed its main fire at the market economy. 

Meanwhile, a new study has found that half of workers in some parts of the country are earning less than the living wage.

Research for the TUC discovered that one in five jobs in Britain pays less than the £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 elsewhere - well above the national minimum wage of £6.50.

A source close to Iain Duncan Smith said: 'They should practise what they preach' 

In some areas, including parts of Birmingham, just over half of workers receive less than the living wage, rising to almost two thirds of women, said the report.

In contrast, fewer than one in 10 workers in parts of London, Surrey, Cambridgeshire and Edinburgh earn less than the living wage.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Extending the living wage is a vital step towards tackling the growing problem of in-work poverty across Britain.

'Working families have experienced the biggest squeeze on their living standards since Victorian times, and these living wage figures show that women are disproportionately affected.

'Pay has been squeezed at all levels below the boardroom, and the Government's mantra about 'making work pay' is completely out of touch with reality.' 

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The growth of low pay under David Cameron shows the Tory plan has failed millions of working families. 

A Business Department spokesman said: 'The Government is committed to improving living standards - particularly for the lowest paid through preventing exploitation, reducing taxes for the lowest paid and increasing employment.'
