The mother of a 6-year-old victim of December’s unthinkable massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in wished the country's teachers ‘courage, faith and love’ Friday as they start a new school year.

Nelba Marquez-Green's daughter Ana Grace was one of 26 killed by Adam Lanza during his Dec. 14, 2012, shooting spree. She also has a son who was at the school at the time of the shooting and was uninjured.

In her letter published on the Education Week website, Marquez-Green praised educators as heroes and described how impressed she was by the teachers at Sandy Hook who came back to work after the tragedy.

‘It takes guts to be a teacher,’ she wrote. ‘Six brave women gave their lives trying to protect their students at Sandy Hook. Other teachers were forced to run from the building, stepping over the bodies of their friends and colleagues, and they came right back to work.

‘While I pray you will never find yourself in the position of the teachers at Sandy Hook, your courage will support students like my son, who have lived through traumas no child should have to,’ she wrote.

Marquez-Greene is herself marriage and family therapist and the mental health director for a nonprofit organization that supports those affected by the mass shooting, called Sandy Hook Promise.

Her letter also contained a promise.

'While
waiting in the firehouse that day to hear the official news that our 
daughter was dead, my husband and I made promises to ourselves, to each 
other, and to our son,' reads the letter. 'We promised to face the 
future with courage, faith, and love.'

She and her husband Jimmy Greene were two of the more visible parents following the Newtown, Connecticut massacre.

'I pray that no mother, father, grandparent or caregiver of children ever have to go through this pain,' Marquez-Greene said at a January press conference pushing for tougher gun laws.

The couple made appearances on national television, including an emotional ABC News interview in which they advocated for a new anti-violence initiative just weeks after the lost their young daughter.

In her letter, Marquez-Greene also emphasized ways to prevent future Sandy Hooks.

She said teachers are the key to having an impact on students who are ‘left out and overlooked, like the isolated young man who killed my daughter.’

‘At some point he was a young, impressionable student, often sitting all alone at school,’ she wrote.

‘You will have kids facing long odds for whom your smile, your encouraging word, and your willingness to go the extra mile will provide the comfort and security they need to try again tomorrow.’

Marquez-Greene said the only letter of the 15,000 she received after the shooting that she keeps at her bedside is one from her own high school English teacher.

‘Real heroes don't wear capes,’ she wrote. ‘They work in America's schools.’
