A captain was forced to abort landing an easyJet plane in Turkey after three drunken passengers 'ran amok' in the aisles.

The flight, from Gatwick, was delayed after the holidaymakers behaved like they were on the TV show 'Jeremy Kyle at 37,000ft', according to a passenger.

The 'crazy' flight, which takes four hours, 23 minutes, only landed in Dalaman when all 155 travellers were seated.

Police were called to meet the plane at the airport, but no arrests were made.

BBC journalist Neil Henderson was on board the flight yesterday. He tweeted: 'Recovering from crazy @easyJet flight to Turkey in which drunk passengers ran amok and caused the landing to be aborted.'

He said that the passengers in question were 'at the back of the plane. Next to me,' adding 'never been in an aborted landing before. Maximum G!'

Mr Henderson later tweeted, comparing the experience to the ITV daytime TV show: ‘Think I need therapy, never mind a holiday. It was like Jeremy Kyle at 37,000 feet’.

A spokesman for easyJet told the Mirror: 'EasyJet can confirm that flight EZY8843 from London Gatwick to Dalaman, Turkey, was met by police on landing following three passengers behaving disruptively during the flight.

'Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously. The captain took the decision to delay landing to ensure the passengers were seated correctly.

'The flight then landed safely and routinely.

'The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority. We would like to apologise to passengers for any inconvenience caused.'

The incident comes after the International Air Transport Association revealed the number of incidents of unruly behaviour reported to it by airlines reached 8,000 in 2013.

It is urging airport ground staff and employees working in airport bars and restaurants to crack down on passengers drinking too much alcohol before a flight.
