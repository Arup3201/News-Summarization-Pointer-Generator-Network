Swansea City are attempting to sign Anderlecht striker Aleksandar Mitrovic with the money they get for Wilfried Bony.

Anderlecht want £15million for the 20-year-old who has impressed in the Champions League against Arsenal.

Newcastle United and Leicester City have already been rebuffed in initial attempts to sign the Serbia international as the player has designs on playing for another Champions League side.

Tottenham Hotspur defender Kyle Naughton is also wanted by Swansea

Liverpool have also watched Mitrovic but have other priorities.

Swansea have signed Nelson Oliveira on loan and do not want to sell Bafetimbi Gomis even though the Frenchman would like to move. The 29-year-old has a release clause which is understood to be £8million but that doesn't kick in until the summer.

The Welsh club are listening to offers for Jonjo Shelvey, though they will not let him go cheaply.

A deal for Kyle Naughton from Tottenham Hotspur is under discussion.
