Residents have accused a council of painting 'pointless' double yellow lines after two new no-parking zones measuring just 12 inches appeared on a London street.

The road markings on Vernon Road in Leytonstone are big enough for a couple of toy cars - but couldn't fit the tyre of a real one.

Waltham Forest Council defended the decision, saying the lines are there to separate parking bays for residents from those reserved for hire cars.

But the road markings don't take the title of Britain's shortest double yellow lines - which are believed to be on Hamilton Road, in Cambridge, and measure just 11 inches.

Residents saw the funny side of the London no-parking zones.  

Emiko Kavanagh-Priest said: 'What pointless double yellow lines. I suppose you can never be too careful though.'

While Phil Akell added: 'They must have problems with unicyclists parking there.'

A spokesman for Waltham Forest Council said: 'These are installed to highlight the differing parking restrictions to motorists and to avoid any possible confusion as to what sign applies to which bay by providing some form of physical separation between the differing bays.

'Indeed in the past we have found that only providing a bay end markings to differentiate between contrasting parking bays can occasionally be obscured by the overhang of parked vehicles.'

Other contenders for Britain's most pointless road markings

Hamilton Road, Cambridge 

These road markings on Hamilton Road in Chesterton are designed to separate a residents' parking zone with a pay and display area and motorists who park on the lines will face a £50 or £70 fine.

At the time, they took over the accolade of Britain's shortest double yellow lines from a set also in Cambridge - on Humberside Road - which measure just 13 inches.

But residents and motorists say the markings, which are about the same length as two iPhone 6's, are a 'ridiculous' waste of time and money and branded them 'pathetic'.

Cwmffrwd, South Wales  

Drivers in a village in south Wales were left bemused and confused after workmen painted double yellow lines - in a layby.

The lines were painted  in the village of Cwmffrwd on the outskirts of Carmarthen. 

One driver spoke to one of the workmen, who admitted he had never put double yellow lines in a lay-by before.

Humberstone Road, Cambridge 

Two sets of double yellow lines measuring just 13 inches long apiece were painted in between parking spaces on a residential road in Cambridge.

Cambridge County Council say the lines are to deter drivers from encroaching on disabled parking bays.

They were the shortest double yellow lines when they were painted in 2013, but the title was taken last year by another Cambridge street.

Adam's Walk in Kingston, south-west London

A council was accused of painting Britain’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre.

Residents were stunned when the lines appeared in Kingston, south west London, last April, curved around a corner kerb at a three-way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle.

The lines were today criticised by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which said it appeared to be ‘another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test’.
