A teenage bride on the hit TV show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has vowed to burn the huge five-stone wedding dress she wore down the aisle after separating from her husband.

Josie McFayden was just 16 when she married Swanley Smith in an enormous frilly white frock followed by a team of bridesmaids dressed in hot pink in a ceremony watched by 6.5million viewers in July 2010. 

Now after less than two years of marriage and the birth of a daughter, Josie, 18, is getting divorced from her husband following a string of blazing rows.

Josie has moved out of the couple's caravan and is living in a house in Middlesex with their eight-month-old child, also called Josie, and her mother.

Today Josie told how she was 'swept off her feet' by Swanley, 21, who she met on a social networking site six months before they married in her dream fairytale wedding.

But she revealed to The Sun newspaper that cracks started to appear just days after the wedding and accused Swanley of treating her like 'a slave'. 

She said: 'It was like a fairytale, but it was too good to be true. Swanley just changed overnight.

'I was supposed to be a lady of leisure bringing my little girl up and he was supposed to provide for his family.

'But I spent four-and-a-half hours a day cleaning and he stopped going to work. I just never felt like his wife, I felt like his maid.'

She added that she felt a weight has been lifted off her shoulders after the split and she will burn her wedding dress to show it is truly over.

Josie said she tried to make the marriage work as the travelling community frowns upon divorce and believe that the family comes before anything else. She admitted that 'in her world' the man comes first and wives are expected to obey.

But the final straw came when she discovered Swanley had secretly spent their savings.

The couple received a £105,000 compensation payment from Surrey County Council after they were forced to leave the site where they were living in Caterham when it was declared contaminated.

But Josie claimed she didn't see any of the money while her husband gave half to his family and spent the rest buying himself X Box games and a £13,000 Rolex watch.

She revealed that Swanley hasn't been to visit his daughter since the couple split but she hopes he will still play a part in her life.

Josie, while insisting the split wasn't because she married too young, admitted that after her own experience she hopes her daughter won't get married until she's in her twenties.

She added that she knows many other travelling couples who married young and are still very happy, including her brother John McFadyen who met his wife Cheyenne at her own wedding.

She is now back with dad Chris and mum Josie at their home in Middlesex, where she is sharing a room with her sister Berry, 14.
