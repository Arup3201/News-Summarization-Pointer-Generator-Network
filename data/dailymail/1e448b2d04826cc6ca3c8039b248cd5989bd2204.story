This is the shocking moment a thug punched and kicked his own dog in a brutal attack launched only because the animal would not sit outside a shop.

Cruel Stacey Barlow, 31, was caught on camera beating cross-breed stray Molly and kicking her with such force that his shoe flew off and landed in the middle of the road.

He also slapped and punched the terrified dog during the vicious attack in Northampton.

Brute: Stacey Barlow, 31, was captured on camera beating rescue dog Molly because she didn't sit outside a shop

Hooligan: Stacey Barlow pleaded guilty to animal cruelty and was fined £100 with costs of £115

Shocking CCTV footage shows Barlow chase her into a blocked-off pathway before he bends down and unleashes a volley of punches and kicks onto his whimpering pet.

At the end of the 15-second clip, callous Barlow is seen walking away to retrieve his shoe from the road while Molly scurries away.

After seeing the footage on Wednesday, shocked magistrates banned Barlow from keeping animals for three years.

Northampton Magistrates Court heard that Barlow also shouted at the dog in an aggressive manner outside the block of flats in Northampton town centre on August 5 this year.

Relentless: Molly is shown being battered and bruised but Stacey claimed that this was a one-off incident

Mindless: He slapped the terrified pooch just because she refused to sit

RSPCA prosecutor Kevin McCole said: 'The dog was examined by a vet after the attack and in his professional opinion the dog would have suffered mental anguish and physical trauma.

'It was a deliberate act of cruelty by the defendant and a nasty incident.

'It did not cause any lasting physical damage but it is a worry that the defendant could turn on his own dog in this fashion.'

Cruel: The attack in Northampton shocked the RSPCA because of its sheer brutality

Stephen Moore, defending, said Barlow had been taking care of Molly for the past nine years after he found her as a stray.

He said this was an 'isolated incident' and not a snapshot of Molly’s life.

Barlow, from Northampton, pleaded guilty and was fined £100 with costs of £115.

Molly has since been taken away from him and will be re-homed.
