Britain is attempting to opt out of a European initiative allowing people to easily remove their details from online service providers such as Facebook.

The controversial move has caused uproar among privacy campaigners, who today accused the government of blocking an 'essential move'

The rule, known as the 'right to be forgotten'  has been developed by the EU justice commissioners in the face of growing complaints about the way Facebook and other social media giants retain information.

The British government is locked in a battle with Viviane Reding, European Information Society and Media Commissioner, over the rules governing how social networks delete data

Introducing the plans, Viviane Reding, the EU justice commissioner, said they are: 'A comprehensive set of existing and new rules to better cope with privacy risks online.

'When modernising the legislation, I want to explicitly clarify that people shall have the right – and not only the 'possibility' – to withdraw their consent to data processing.

'The burden of proof should be on data controllers – those who process your personal data.

'They must prove that they need to keep the data rather than individuals having to prove that collecting their data is not necessary.'

In its 
current form, which is not finalised, article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation provides for punitive fines – up to 2% of global turnover –
 for companies that refuse to comply with requests to erase customers' 
personal details.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The right to be forgotten is a political sound bite that got out of control, but the idea behind it is an essential move.

'It’s absolutely right that for companies who do not legally need to keep data, if you leave a service you should be able to delete your data wherever it appears across that service.

'This change gives citizens that right.'

Britain's objection to the EU move is that unrealistic expectations
 will be created by the right's expansive title because the controls 
proposed will be relatively modest in their impact on the way data 
spreads, or is traded, across websites.

Mr Pickles agreed with these concerns, but called for the bill to be saved.

'There are fair concerns about who is responsible for tracking down and deleting information if it has appeared on other services, but that is no reason to junk the whole proposal.

'Equally, it is critical that British citizens do not have weaker rights than people in other countries when we are dealing with international services.

'That creates needless complexity for individuals and businesses so I hope the detail can be worked out to ensure proper protections that are feasible and will not cripple small businesses.”

Viviane Reding, the EU justice commissioner, said: 'At present a citizen
 can request deletion only if data is incomplete or incorrect.

The rules were proposed following a slew of complaints against sites such as Mark Zuckerberg's (pictured) Facebook

'We want
 to extend this right to make it stronger in this internet world. The 
burden of proof shall be on the companies, they will have to show that 
data is needed.'

She described the legislation as 'One of the biggest market-openers of the 
last few years.'

The Ministry of Justice said: 'The UK does not support the right to be forgotten as 
proposed by the European commission. The title raises unrealistic and 
unfair expectations of the proposals.

'We are also concerned about potentially impossible requirements for 
data controllers to manage third-party erasure; the "reasonable steps" 
required by the draft regulation would promise much, but deliver 
little.'
