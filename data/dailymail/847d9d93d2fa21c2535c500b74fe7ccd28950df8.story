Young Jess Hawley can glide through the water like a graceful water baby - but may never be able to say her own name or even walk.

The brave 20-month-old suffers from a condition which doctors do not know the cause of and have struggled to find a cure for.

Jess, from Stafford, has SWAN - Syndrome Without A Name - meaning medics have told her devastated parents she may never walk or be able to hold a conversation.

The debilitating genetic condition means children often require round-the-clock care from their parents, and sees those who suffer from it miss developmental milestones as they grow up.

But while little Jess may never walk or talk, her mother Emma says she is as confident as any other child her age once takes to the water.

The youngster happily swims about under the watchful eye of her parents, despite the hardships she faces in every other aspect of her life.

Emma and her 34-year-old husband Ben noticed their second daughter wasn't developing at the same rate as their other girl, Natalie, now five, when she was just four-months-old.

Emma, an admin manager, told The Sun: 'We’ve been told by doctors she may never walk or talk.

'It’s so heartbreaking to see friends’ children reaching their milestones and thinking, sadly, ‘She may never be able to do that.’

'Yet in the water, there’s no difference between Jess and any other child. In fact, she’s much more confident and happy swimming about.

'Swimming has been our saviour – to see her so serene and happy when otherwise life is so hard.'

Emma said she struggled to get Jess to eat or drink, and was initially told it could be a reflux - where babies are sick automatically after eating.

But when the symptoms continued and Emma was unable to breastfeed her daughter, doctors were at a loss to explain what was wrong with the youngster.

Eventual MRI scans and further tests showed Jess had been born with an under-developed brain, leading doctors to diagnose her with SWAN - Syndrome Without A Name.

The devastation diagnosis often leaves parents feeling as they have no idea what to expect from their child.

There are thought to be around 6,000 disabled British children born every year who are born as 'SWAN babies'.

Often symptoms are similar. Babies have problems with feeding and gaining weight. They may have significant learning difficulties, facial features such as low-set ears, heart conditions, vision problems and epilepsy.

Problems vary enormously from child to child, and SWAN is not an illness in its own right. Experts believe these conditions are genetic.

But each case is thought to be the only one of its kind, which makes a proper diagnosis – and prognosis – incredibly difficult.

Each parent will have been given the same utterly frustrating news by doctors: there is no way of knowing what the future may hold for their child.

Treatment is a matter of fire-fighting, tackling problems as they arise. It is impossible to pre-empt difficulties because there are no previous cases to reference.

To Emma's delight, Jess began to crawl a few weeks ago, although both parents realise she does not talk, may not be able to hear, and does not respond to her own name.

Emma said both her and husband Ben have at times been 'upset' by the condition, admitting they are 'terrified about the future' and whether Jess will survive.

The brave little girl struggles with many things in life, but her mother has taken heart from the manner in which she dosn't appear daunted by water.

Emma told The Sun: 'The future is such a big unknown, yet swimming is the one thing Jess can do better than any other child in her Water Babies class.

'I love to see her — and it gives us all so much hope.'

While the search for a definitive diagnosis may sound irrelevant as SWAN children clearly have disabilities, the lack of a medical label makes their situations more difficult.

Not only are the families looking after children with extreme needs, they are also dealing with complicated bureaucracy to get help.

‘Having a clear diagnosis assists patients to get access to help,’ explains Lizzie Chambers, deputy director of the charity Together For Short Lives.

‘Ideally there would be a key worker for each family who assessed all their needs. In reality everything is disjointed. Families have to repeat their stories over again to different doctors.

'They need health, education and social care – which are represented by different departments of social services – as well as medical care.’
