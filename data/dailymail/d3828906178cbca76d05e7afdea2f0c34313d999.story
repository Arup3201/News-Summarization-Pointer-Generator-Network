For most new parents, bringing their newborn baby home from hospital is a joyous day. But for Kirsty Elliott, it was clouded with worry.

Diagnosed with cervical cancer when she was six months pregnant, the day marked the start of her long battle with the disease.

'I started five weeks of radiotherapy on
the same day my son Lucas came out of hospital,' the mother-of-two told MailOnline.

'So although it was great to have him home, I was terrified at the same time.'

Kirsty with Darren and baby Lucas at Christmas: The family hope an MRI scan in March will reveal Kirsty has beaten cervical cancer

Ms Elliott and her fiance Darren Waters, 27, had discovered she was pregnant over Christmas in 2011. Although she had a four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, this would be their first child together.

'We were thrilled as we hadn't been trying for long,' she said.

'I was quite under the weather for the first few months but I put it down to being pregnant.'

Staying strong: Kirsty when she was 30 weeks pregnant and knew she had cervical cancer. She had to wait until she was 32 weeks before she could have Lucas via C section

But at 24 weeks, things started to go horribly wrong.

'I was just getting ready to go to my daughter Macey's ballet show,' said Ms Elliott, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, in South Wales.

'I was putting on my make up when I felt a trickle down my leg and I realised I was bleeding. Then I felt contractions starting.

'I was panicking so much but luckily Darren was there and he rushed me straight our local hospital.'

Ms Eliott was seen at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in South Wales before she was transferred to the Llandough Hospital in Cardiff.

Thankfully, her contractions eased and after a few days of being monitored she was allowed home.

Doctors suspected she had a water infection that had threatened to bring on early labour. But a few days later she started bleeding again and this time doctors spotted lesions on her cervix.

'I had had a borderline smear test a month before I got pregnant,' she said.

'Now they did another smear test and it came back severely abnormal. They told us it was probably cervical cancer but to know more they would need to do a biopsy to confirm it.'

She was 28 weeks pregnant when she received the news she had been dreading.

'I was in shock. I couldn't believe I had cancer,' she said.

'I was pregnant and I was only 25 at the time. I felt like it was happening to somebody else.'

Her
doctors advised her to have a Caesarean at 32 weeks, to give her baby 
and herself their best chances of survival. An agonising four weeks of 
waiting followed.

'I had 
such mixed emotions during that time. I was trying to get excited about 
my new baby and was busy getting the room prepared as well as being as 
normal as possible for my daughter Macey.

'Yet all the time I knew my cancer could be spreading.'

Doctors planned to perform a C Section followed straight afterwards by a hysterectomy where they would 
attempt to remove any traces of cancer.

'I remember I saw Lucas for a second before he was rushed to the neonatal unit, but that's all,' she said.

'When I finally came around I was so relieved because I thought the cancer had gone.

'But the doctors then told me they hadn't performed the hysterectomy as they suspected it had spread to the lymph nodes.'

Lucas was allowed home after a week 
in the neonatal unit, which was on the same day that Kirsty started five
weeks of radiotherapy.

She had expressed milk before starting treatment but now struggled to bond with Lucas.

'I wasn't able to hold him for five days and I 
couldn't breastfeed so I didn't feel like he was mine at first,' she said.

'It
was really hard as some days I barely had the energy to get out of bed.
My four-year-old daughter was at home for the summer holidays and I 
couldn't take her out places.

'Plus Darren, who plays rugby for the Newport Gwent Dragons, was at home with a knee injury.'

Ms
Elliott also had chemotherapy once a week. Her treatment triggered an 
early menopause, which means she won't be able to have any further 
children.

'It was a very lonely time,' she said. 'Nobody 
understood how I felt - some days I just didn't want to be positive like 
my relatives. As a result, she turned to the support offered by Macmillan nurses.

'I could ring the nurses and they understood.'

Kirsty was first able to hold Lucas when he was five days old (l). He is now seven-months old

Kirsty and Darren, who are getting married in December, with Macey and Lucas.

In December, an MRI revealed cancer her gone from her lymph nodes, although it was visible on her cervix.

'My
body has responded to the treatment but I had hoped to be given the 
all-clear so we could have a clean slate for 2013. But the doctors are 
hoping the tumour will have gone from my cervix by March,' she said.

'I
still have my down days and think "Why us?"

'But we're thankful that we have two wonderful children and we're looking forward to getting married in December.

'Lucas has caught up with other boys his age and he's a healthy seven-month-old who laughs all the time, so we have to be thankful for that.'
