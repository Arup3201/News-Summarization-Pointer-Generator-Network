The man behind a grotesque animal slaughter porn site that was shut down by police earlier this year is a Miami fishing captain from a prominent South Florida family.

Authorities say Adam Redford, 57, ran several fetish porn websites and paid women as little as $200 to strip naked and kill and torture rabbits, chickens, rats, pigs, goats and fish.

However, before Redford became 'Captain Codpiece' and descended into the dark world of animal 'crush porn,' he grew up in a prominent family, the Miami Herald reports.

Redford acknowledged to the Herald that he had founded the porn websites, but said he worked to ensure all animals were killed humanely and claimed that they were used for food after they were slaughtered. 

Redford's mother Polly Redford is the daughter of Laurens Hammond - the wealthy inventor of the Hammond electric organ. She was a well-known conservationist and author who fought to protect the beaches and waters in South Florida. She loved animals so much that she adopted a raccoon and wrote a book about the creatures.

Son of a prominent family: Jim Redford, 57, is the son of a former Dade County Commissioner and the wealthy heir to the Hammond electric organs fortune

Redford was a fishing guide and a commercial diver before his descent into brutal animal crush porn

Before Redford began filming hardcore pornography and horrific animal snuff porn, he produced PG-rated calendars of bikini babes holding trophy fish

His father, Jim Redford, owned a Burger King franchise and served as a Dade County Commissioner for 14 years. He was also an avid fisherman and known for his work to preserve South Florida waterways. 

In April, police arrested fetish models Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, and charged Redford with animal cruelty in connection with the sites. 

However, prosecutors were later forced to drop all charges because the videos were filmed more than ten years ago and the statue of limitations had expired. 

After growing up in a wealthy family, Redford became a commercial diver. He then became a fishing guide in the waters off the Everglades. 

'He wasn’t making a lot of money doing that, so he went to the porn stuff,' fellow guide Captain Mark 'The Shark' Quartiano told the Herald. 

Redford started out tame - shooting pictures of bikini models holding big fish. In 2002, he produced a calendar that he sold for $15 on sexyoutdoorsports.com. He also offered coffee mugs, t-shirts and mouse pads with the pictures. 

Redford's videos featured horrific scene of animal slaughter and abuse. This scene, one of his least horrifying, features two women in heels kicking around a lobster and stepping on it

Angler's fantasy: Redford will not face charges for the videos, though he says he has stopped filming after the police investigation. Redford was never accused of wrongdoing over his trophy fish calendars

Later, he filmed a video called 'Have Rod, Will Travel' in which he played 'Captain Codpiece.' The VHS featured footage of topless women fishing.

By 2007, he branched out into hardcore porn and then into darker, 'crush porn.'

The videos of amateurish, clearly shot with a handheld camcorder. 

Zamora, who cooperated with authorities after her arrest, says she was paid as little as $200 to slaughter chickens and perform sex acts when she was just 18 and 19 years old.

She said Redford directed each model and told them how to hold the animals and how and when to slaughter them.  

One of the least violent scenes from Redford's videos shows a bikini model shooting a dead a goat in a field before stripping off over the animal's dead remains

'It’s humiliation, that’s the name of the game. These guys pretend to be helpless, they pretend to be a helpless animal,' she said in a police deposition. 

Redford even collected cash from viewers to make custom videos where the models would recite lines and perform specific torture on animals, the Herald reports.  

Videos show women stapling a rat to a board, hacking at chickens to had been tied up, slicing the heads off baby goats with dull knives, repeatedly stabbing fish.

Zamora said Redford asked her to run over rabbits with a car. 

'There is one instance where a female holding two rabbits upside down by their hind legs violently chops at the back of their necks as the animals thrash about,' Stephanie Bell, an investigator for PETA told the Herald. 

'These are sadistic acts.'
