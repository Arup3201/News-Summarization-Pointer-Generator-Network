Social media rumours of a planned terrorist attack on the London Underground have today been quashed by police.

Last night hoax emails and texts warning London commuters to avoid the Tube today because of a specific terrorist threat snowballed on social media.

They appeared to have been triggered by the recent decision to raise the terrorist threat alert to its highest state in three years.

The hoax message read: 'In case you have anyone in London. Don't travel on the tubes tomorrow.

'Every
 single police officer in the Met has been called into work from 4am 
onwards, even people on holiday are being told to catch the next flight 
home.

Paul Brogden, from the British Transport Police, quickly dispelled the rumours with his own tweet

Battersea Sargent Nathan Shickle also dispelled the rumours, clearly stating they were a 'hoax'

The hoax was spread widely before police confirmed rumours of a specific threat were 'completely untrue'

Police have reassured commuters there is no need to be alarmed and asked they 'keep calm and carry on'

It goes on: 'They think there's a terror threat and that it will happen on the tubes tomorrow around the west end area. So don't go travelling on tubes. It's better to be safe than sorry.'

Police moved quickly to dispel the misinformation, with a Met Police spokesman saying the rumour was 'completely untrue'.

Several senior officers also responded via Twitter.

Nathan Shickle, Battersea Sector Sargent, tweeted: 'Rumour control: The "alert" doing the rounds on social about all Met officers being called in for 4am tomorrow is a hoax.'

And Paul Brogden, British Transport Police Divisional Commander for London, posted: 'Social media contains lots of rumours regarding threats to tube network tomorrow. There is no specific threat so keep calm & carry on.'

While there has been an increased police presence at some stations, police say there is no specific threat

The rumours spread quickly over Twitter last night as they were shared and retweeted

Although there was concern caused by the hoax, police told everyone the rumour was 'completely untrue'

The rumour was likely to have started after the Home Office raised the terror threat alert to 'severe'

On Friday Home Secretary Theresa May raised the terror threat level from 'substantial' to 'severe'.

Despite stating there was no 'specific' threat when raising it, this appears to have been overlooked in last night's social media panic.

Prime Minster David Cameron has said the public can expect to see an increase in high-profile police patrols, including the greater use of armed officers, particularly at airports and major railway stations.

He called for the public to be vigilant but added they should not panic, saying Britain had shown ‘resolve’ in the face of terror before.
