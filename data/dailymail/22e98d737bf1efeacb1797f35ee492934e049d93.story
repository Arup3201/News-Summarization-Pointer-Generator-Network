A restaurant run by three school friends serving £5 burgers in a train carriage has beaten top London eateries to be crowned the best in the capital.

Every customer who reviewed Caboose restaurant on the TripAdvisor website gave it top marks for food, service and atmosphere.

It's now rated higher than 17,000 other restaurants in the capital, including Michelin Star rated Restaurant Gordon Ramsay (4), Le Gavroche (6) and The Ledbury (7).

The restaurant, run by three school mates James Bostock, Gandalf Roudette-Muschamp and Jim Cartwright, rated higher than 17,000 other restaurants in the capital

While these typically offer food priced from £45 to over £100, lunch at Caboose in the trendy Brick Lane area of London offers meals at a fraction of the price.

Its burger menu of pulled pork, shredded beef and sides is cooked overnight by either restaurant owners James Bostock, Gandalf Roudette-Muschamp and Jim Cartwright or one of their three other members of staff.

The trio, who opened up just 18 months ago, originally got together at a pub in late 2012 to brainstorm their new business idea after becoming disillusioned with their current careers.

Mr Bostock, 29, read Law at the University of Leicester and had just completed a masters at the prestigious BPP Law School in Holborn, London.

But things changed when he got together with his friends Mr Roudette-Muschamp, 30, and Mr Cartwright, 29, who he had known since the age of 13 when they started out at the University College School together in Hampstead, North London.

Mr Bostock said: 'We were all at a particular point where we were either fed up with what we were currently doing or up for doing something entirely different.

'I'd just finished my master's degree and LPC in law and was pretty turned off by the idea of practice.

The £5 'Fat Controller' burger consists of 10 hour pulled pork belly smoked for 10 hours over fruit wood chips and served with homemade BBQ sauce, oak lettuce, house pickles and smoked cheddar

The Brick Lane restaurant serves a stripped-down street food menu during the day. In the evening it hosts a hotly acclaimed three-course private meal for groups of eight to 12 people

'Jim had his own Christmas tree operation, which was turning a good profit but was naturally quite seasonal and left him twiddling his thumbs for the rest of the year.

'Gandalf was and still is a music producer and tour manager with considerable skill in carpentry which would ultimately be the basis of building the Caboose.

'We knew we wanted to do something with food and soon realised that we didn't have the capital to even entertain the idea of going into a bricks and mortar restaurant.

'So we began looking at the London street food scene, which was, and still is, an incredibly burgeoning market.

'When we designed the Caboose we saw how we could set up a hybrid street-food eatery, which would sell street food during the day but also have the capacity to seat people for more extensive meals.'

A caboose is a carriage at the end of a freight train which provides shelter for crew at the end of a train.

Using Mr Cartwright's yard in Wembley they spent three months building their own Caboose before moving it to Brick Lane and opening for business in May 2013.

Just 18 months later, they are rated higher than all 61 restaurants in the capital with at least one Michelin Star.

The Caboose has two main sessions each day.

It serves a stripped back 'street-food menu' during the day out of the hatch from midday until late afternoon and then hosts a hotly acclaimed three-course private meal in the cabin each evening from 8pm for £30 a head and groups of eight to 12 people who bring their own booze.

Its gourmet burger menu centres mainly around its staple offerings of 10-hour apple wood-smoked pork belly, and 12-hour hickory-smoked shredded short rib of beef, which is slow cooked overnight.

Mr Bostock said: 'At first we thought we would just be doing weddings and festivals but to be top on Trip Advisor is an amazing achievement.

'While we make no assumptions in the slightest that our food can compare to the level of gastronomy you might find at some of the Michelin star restaurants elsewhere in London, what we do offer is high-quality, simple, and above all tasty food with a dining experience unlike any other I know of in the capital.

'I think our rank on Trip Advisor is a reflection of how we are a bit of a different experience and we like a party atmosphere - it's the whole thing together that makes us a novelty that people love.

'At first we had no idea how the three-course meals in the cabin would be received.

'It's an incredibly unique space and due to its size is incredibly intimate.

'I personally work the majority of the bookings so I get to know each and every person that dines with us on an evening and it's great fun.

Caboose's street-food menu during the day revolves around their signature burgers served in a toasted brioche bun:

The £5 'Fat Controller' burger consists of 10 hour pulled pork belly smoked for 10 hours over fruit wood chips and served with homemade BBQ sauce, oak lettuce, house pickles and smoked cheddar.

'The 3.10 To Yuma', at £5.50, is filled with 12-hour shredded flat rib of beef smoked over hickory and the same extras.

Meanwhile, a third option is 'The Derailer', at £6, which is marketed as a mountainous mix of both their cuts of meat laced with their homemade hot sauce.

Sides are also reasonably priced at just £1.50 a go, including rosemary, sea salt and black pepper twice-cooked fries, house salad and sweet maple slaw.

One TripAdvisor review left on Monday night read: 'We booked Caboose for the evening which basically meant we had our own private restaurant!

'The food and service were amazing and it was great value.

'Since our visit every one of my friends that attended has mentioned how they can't stop thinking about the pulled pork/beef sandwiches!!'

Another reviewer who visited Caboose last month wrote: 'The food is completely excellent.

'I'll leave it to previous reviews to explain what good pulled pork and beef is.

'Add to that great staff and the ability to bring far more booze than you need and you have a really excellent (and not very expensive) night out.'
