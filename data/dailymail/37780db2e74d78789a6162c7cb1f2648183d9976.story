One hundred years ago this week, the First World War hospital ship Rohilla ran aground in horrific conditions off the coast of Yorkshire.

Lifeboats fought through a fierce storm to reach the stricken vessel, but, after a three-day rescue mission which saved 144 people, dozens of medical staff and crew died.

Yesterday a flotilla of 15 boats sailing from Whitby, North Yorkshire, marked one of the most dramatic rescues in history, lowering a wreath into the waters where 85 people died.

The Rohilla ran aground 400 yards from the shore near Whitby, North Yorkshire. A total of 85 died, but 144 survived after one of the most dramatic rescue missions in British naval history

A flotilla yesterday paid tribute to those who died, as well as the rescuers - including the Whitby RNLI lifeboat crew (pictured) - involved in the Rohilla rescue in 1914

Paying their respects: The RNLI and others laid wreathes in the waters where the Rohilla ran aground 100 years ago last week

On October 30, 1914, the hospital ship set sail from Edinburgh to Dunkirk to evacuate wounded soldiers, but would not reach the French coast.

With lighthouses off and a storm raging on the north-east, Captain Neilson was unable to stop the ship from running aground on a reef about 400 yards from the coast.

As it became clear that the ship was sinking, dozens of people on board the ship made the decision to try and swim to safety, but many did not make it.

The conditions were so horrendous that lifeboats from nearby towns struggled for days to reach the ship, however they were eventually able to rescue 144 men and women. A total of 85 perished in one of the worst disasters in British naval history.

People aboard the 15-boat flotilla of lifeboats sailed to the wreckage site to pay their respects by lowering wreathes into the water. 

The commemoration, organised by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), saw the lifeboats sail to the site, where a service was held to remember Rohilla's heros.

Tributes: Families of the doomed passengers came from all over the world to remember those who died

Families of the doomed passengers came from all over the world to remember those who died, including Steven Kirk and his wife Lorraine, who travelled from Australia to pay respects to his great grandfather George Kirk, a member of the crew who was lost in the disaster.

Steven said: 'It's a great privilege to be here to share in this very special occasion.

'Even though I never knew George and his incredible story wasn't one I learned about until fairly recently, I felt it was important to be here to pay my respects to him and all the other people who died on the Rohilla.'

He added: 'This has been a great honour.'  

Also launched as part of the flotilla was historic lifeboat the William Riley, which, 100 years ago, was lowered on a rope into the crashing waves in a bid to rescue the 229 people on board the Rohilla.

The William Riley was one of six vessels which carried out the three-day mission to save the passengers.

One of the first motor lifeboats, the Henry Vernon - the only vessel able to reach the last 50 survivors on board the stricken ship - also took part in the event.

A plaque on Whitby's West Pier was also unveiled this weekend while a special church service was held in remembrance of the people on board the doomed vessel, names which included Titanic survivor Mary Kezia Roberts, who also survived the disaster.

Whitby's RNLI museum curator Peter Thompson MBE said: 'This commemorative weekend has been a very long time in the planning and I'm proud that we have been able to pay a fitting tribute to both those who died and to those who struggled against all the odds to rescue the survivors.

'Fortunately, the weather was kind to us. We have had very different conditions to those experienced 100 years ago on board the Rohilla.

'It was very moving to be able to go out to the site of the Rohilla wreck and to remember just what it must have been like for the poor souls on board the stricken vessel, some of them waiting more than two days to be rescued.

'We must never forget stories like this one, or the people who died during one of the worst tragedies ever to take place off the Yorkshire coast.'

Twice a survivor: Mary Kezia Roberts was on board the Titanic and the Rohilla

Stewardess Mary Kezia Roberts was a stewardess on board the Titanic when it sunk on April 14, 1912.  

More than 1,500 people died but she, and hundreds of other people on board the doomed vessel, were rescued.

She would later note that the White Star Line stopped her pay at 2.20am, the exact time Titanic sank. 

Not put off life at sea, the mother-of-five continued working on ships for the next two years.

In 1914, she boarded the SS Rohilla. Little did she know that she would be involved in another disastrous shipwreck. 

As the Rohilla sank Mary Roberts was brought ashore by lifeboat, and was later quoted as saying the Rohilla sinking was worse to endure than the Titanic.

Miss Roberts, one of only five women aboard the Rohilla, was among the first 17 survivors rescued by the Whitby lifeboatmen, which went back to rescue a further 18 before it too was smashed by the storm. 

99 years later her trunk, which was left on the ship in the panic to escape the sinking, washed ashore.

The trunk, an intriguing relic of maritime history, was recovered by the Whitby Lifeboat Museum, after its curator, Pete Thomson, spotted it for sale on eBay.

He said: 'It’s spooky, the fact that I have got this here now, 99 years later. Mary Roberts carried it on to the Rohilla and then she never saw it again.

'When the sea calmed down the rocks would be crawling with people picking up items and it’s been missing for the last 99 years until it surfaced on eBay for sale a month ago.'
