Former WWE wrestler CM Punk has been pictured in UFC gear for the first time since announcing he had agreed a deal with the mixed martial arts company.

Phillip Brooks, the 36-year-old's real name, revealed in December last year that he had signed a multi-fight contract with the UFC and will fight in the welterweight or middleweight division.

CM Punk isn't due to make his debut until later this year but he has taken part in a photoshoot revealing his UFC image.

The announcement of his switch was made at UFC 181 in December, as Robbie Lawler beat Johny Hendricks in their welterweight title rematch.

CM Punk's last appearance in WWE came in January 2014 during the annual Royal Rumble event. In an interview Punk revealed that he was suspended by the WWE after walking out shortly after the event.

Following the lifting of his suspension CM Punk claimed he was not contacted by the company and his contract was terminated in June. 

CM Punk follows in the footsteps of former WWE stars Lesnar, Dave Bautista and Bobby Lashley.
