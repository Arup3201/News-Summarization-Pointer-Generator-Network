A young mother was arrested on Monday for causing the death of her infant son, who died two days prior from malnutrition 

Macayla Jo Armstrong remains imprisoned at Buchanon County Jail in St Joseph, Missouri on charges of child neglect. 

Police were called to the 22-year-old woman's home on the 1700 block of Belle Street on Saturday due to a medical emergency.

Victim: Prosecutors say the 22-year-old mother did not provide sanitary living conditions, food, nourishment, and medical care to the boy (pictured) 

Her 7-month-old son was later pronounced dead. 

Prosecutors say Armstrong did not provide healthy and sanitary living conditions, food, nourishment and medical care which led to the infant's premature death. 

Armstrong's 5-year-old daughter was also exposed to the sub-par living conditions, and is now in the care of others. 

When she was booked in jail on Monday, it was also revealed that Armstrong is pregnant with another child and is not taking any prenatal vitamins or seeking medical attention for the unborn baby. 

A relative of Armstrong's posted a picture of the baby who passed  on Facebook this weekend. 

Seen holding the baby in happier and healthier times, the relative wrote: 'You'll never be forgotten even [though] you didn't get to enjoy life, at least [you're] in a better place.'
