Living near parks and green spaces in town and cities boosts your mental well-being.

Not only does moving to a greener area improves mental health, but the effect continues long after you have moved.

The research by the University of Exeter Medical School is one of the first studies to consider the effects of green space over time and its result could lead to town planners including green spaces in new developments.

The study traced participants over five years and used data from the British Household Panel Survey, information gathered from questionnaires filled in by households across Great Britain.

Using data from more than 1,000 participants, the study focused on two groups of people, those who moved to greener urban areas and those who relocated to less green urban areas.

On average movers to greener areas experienced an immediate improvement in mental health that was sustained for at least three years after they moved. 

The study, published in the journal of Environmental Science & Technology, also showed that people relocating to more built up areas suffered a decline in mental health.

Interestingly this fall occurred before they moved and returning to normal once the move was complete.

The authors adjusted their data to remove effects from other factors likely to affect mental health over time - such as income, employment and education - as well as factors related to personality. 

Dr Ian Alcock said: 'We've shown that individuals who move to greener areas have significant and long-lasting improvements in mental health. 

'These findings are important for urban planners thinking about introducing new green spaces to our towns and cities, suggesting they could provide long term and sustained benefits for local communities.'

In 2012 the World Health Organisation cited depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide, and this study builds on research that has found natural environments could act as vital resources to improve health and wellbeing.

Yet up until now, scientists have been unsure how these effects vary over time.

Co-author Dr Mathew White added: 'We needed to answer important questions about how the effects of green space vary over time. 

'Do people experience a novelty effect, enjoying the new green area after the move, but with the novelty then wearing off? 

'Or do they take time to realise the benefits of their new surroundings as they gradually get to know local parks? 

'What we've found suggests that the mental health benefits of green space are not only immediate, but sustainable over long periods of time.'
