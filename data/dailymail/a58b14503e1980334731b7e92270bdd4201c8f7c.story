Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has opened up about dealing with those who 'detest' him and his fractious relationship with David Cameron.  

As the Lib Dems today met in Glasgow for their autumn conference, Mr Clegg spoke of being misled by the Tories, Ukip's growing threat and his own parties sliding numbers, being ridiculed and calls for his resignation.

But far from feeling defeated, Mr Clegg said it had only made him stronger.   

Nick Clegg applauds during the Lib Dems conference in Glagow today; the Deputy Prime Minister has spoken out about those who 'detest' him and how it has helped him develop a thicker skin

Mr Clegg described the beginning of his political career as being 'quite a baptism of fire'

'Of course there are people who detest me, on left and right, I wouldn't be doing my job if they didn't. But you are toughened up after four and a half years. I've got a thicker skin.' Mr Clegg told The Times. 

He said the beginning of his political career was, 'quite a baptism of fire' and he was being 'flayed alive' in the media everyday.  

'I wouldn't wish those six months on my worst enemy. 

'It was not pleasant but I'm much more comfortable in my skin now about what I'm doing and clear about what I want to do next. In the end, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'

For three years the Lib Dems have been resisting Tory attempts to freeze benefits, and now Mr Clegg says the Conservations are becoming merciless and 'wielding the axe'  at those who are living in poverty.

His comments follow a speech by George Osborne, where he said the rich shouldn't have to pay any extra to reduce of the deficit.

Mr Clegg, seen here meeting candidates, said he hoped to retain his party seats by securing the middle ground between the views held by George Osborne and Ed Miliband

He said the Tories need restraining, and if they get into government on their own the 'poor will get poorer' and there will be cuts to essential services like the police, social care and public services - because they won't use taxation. 

Mr Clegg said he felt let down by the Tories who had almost 'muted' almost out of recognition and now didn't stand for any of the things he thought united them as a coalition. They were in a 'blind panic' over Ukip, he said.

The betrayal and division between the parties became very personal and public this week when Theresa May accused Mr Clegg of putting children's lives at risk by blocking the snooper's charter. 

While once the parties were allies, they were now political enemies. 

Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron were never best mates, he said.

Mr Clegg rubbished David Cameron's efforts on the environment - a 'pale green spray-paint job' - and his proposal to seize the passports of returning jihadists, which 'is never going to happen'.

And he won't support the Prime Minister's plan to introduce English votes for English laws.

Although the Lib Dems could lose half their seats at the next election, Mr Clegg believes he can hold on to them by seizing the middle ground that exists between Mr Osborne and Ed Miliband political positions. 

Today, at the Lib Dem conference, Mr Clegg pledged an extra £1 billion a year for the NHS and plans to pressure the chancellor to release more funds for the health service.

Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems had been knocked-back a lot, but many of their ideas had been picked-up along the way. 

The Tories adopted his plan to raise the tax threshold to £12,500, and the mansion tax, although Mr Clegg has further refined the idea to include levies on the most expensive homes.

Despite the souring of the coalition-coupling, Mr Clegg said they would remain together until May.
