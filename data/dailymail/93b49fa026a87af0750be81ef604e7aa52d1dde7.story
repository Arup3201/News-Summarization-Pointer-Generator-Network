The Birds Eye study reveals that one in ten people in Britain eat their dinner in the office (file picture)

Brits fall into four categories when it comes to mealtimes, a nationwide survey spanning the last 20 years has revealed.

Looking at the way real people eat these days The Big Mealtime Audit by Birds Eye found we're either Rep-eat-ers, Social-eats, Free Rangers or All Day Grazers.

Traditional Rep-eat-ers stick to a square three meals a day and hate throwing food away, while Social-eats are foodies who regularly eat out and host dinner parties at least twice a week.

Food-loving All Day Grazers are snackers who fit their meals in around their jobs sometimes scoffing up to 11 times a day.

Over a third (34 per cent) have brinner - breakfast for dinner - and 42 per cent enjoy a late night snack.

And busy Brits make up the 20 per cent of us who are Free Rangers- time-poor Brits who have to grab food wherever they can on the go.

According to the findings over a quarter of Brits (26 per cent) now eat their breakfast on their commute while one in ten (ten per cent) eat their dinner in the office or in the car.

In addition, 85 per cent said they regularly snack to get them through the day.

At home, Brits spend on average just 25 minutes around the dinner table. The most common dinner table topic is family (32 per cent) while almost one in seven (15 per cent) use their meal to talk football.

To better understand how Brit's consumption habits have changed over the years Birds Eye has appointed one of the world's most respected photographers to undertake a documentary of how we eat today called the 'Food of Life' campaign.

Martin Parr, who has famously captured the personal tastes and habits of Britons for more than 22 years, will be spend the next four months producing a unique snapshot of British mealtimes.

As well as travelling the country and finding subjects to take part in the project, three members of the public will win the chance to be photographed by submitting pictures of their mealtime moments to birdseyeview.birdseye.co.uk

Birds Eye Marketing Director Margaret Jobling said: 'Mealtimes are still clearly the glue that holds families and friends together, even though the nation's eating and consumption habits have changed and we might not be sitting down for the traditional three square meals a day.

'The research, combined with the Martin Parr study will help us to understand and celebrate this as we're passionate about creating food that can be enjoyed every day by everyone.'

The results will be exhibited in London from September.
