Agnieszka Pomaska said her fellow countrymen were applying for better paid jobs now than before

Poles have ended up competing for highly paid professional jobs in the UK because they are better educated and work harder than their British counterparts, a Polish MP has suggested.

Agnieszka Pomaska, a senior MP with her country’s ruling party, said Polish immigrants to Britain were no longer seeking low-paid work in the agricultural sector as they did a decade ago.

Instead, she said, her countrymen would inevitably seek out middle-class professions.

Speaking at a conference in London yesterday, Miss Pomaska criticised British politicians who suggest immigration from the EU has prevented British youths from finding jobs.

She said Britain had been happy to open the labour market when it needed low paid agricultural workers and it was not possible to ‘eat the cake and still have it’.

‘You mentioned the problem of competition from Eastern European, Polish people and that they are not so well paid; you say that British people can’t get a job because someone else has got it.

‘But competition is a part of a free market economy so you can’t blame people that are able to compete.

‘It’s not only about the money they get, it’s also about sometimes education and competing in a different way... I think it’s wrong to say they are stealing places to work.

‘You have to remember why you opened the labour market, you did it because you needed these people.

‘About agriculture, Poles and other nations came here because Brits didn’t want to do this work anymore and now the Polish people are better educated and their knowledge of English is better so they are looking for other possibilities.

‘That’s why some of the employers in the agriculture sphere are complaining there are no Poles who like to work there.

‘So we should remember how we started this process of opening the labour market. It’s not possible to eat the cake and still have it.’

Miss Pomaska, 33, chairman of the Polish parliament’s European Affairs Committee, pointed out that Poland’s education system is doing better than Britain’s in international rankings.

The issue has ignited a war of words 
this week between David Cameron and Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk,
 after Mr Cameron suggested Britain should cease the payments

And she defended the payment of child
 benefit to Poles in the UK whose children live abroad, saying they pay 
tax and spend their money here.

At the same event Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, said: ‘I think we should be absolutely clear, 
we know we have got a skills deficit in this country, I mean this is the
 elephant in room.

Priti Patel described the country's 'skills deficit'

‘Immigration of the brightest and the best will always do well and prosper in this country.’

She said the education system in Britain
 in the past had not been ‘outward looking’ and competitive enough, 
adding: ‘I despair on that point I really do.

'I worked for a range of 
companies around the world and you can see what the competition is like.

'And it is extraordinary that we had that lack of focus on training and 
skills development in this country.

‘We have to be brutal and face 
the facts in this country.

'We have had generations in this country that 
haven’t worked, and so that’s become their social norm and trying to 
break that culture of worklessness which is one of the largest battle 
this government has alongside making schools competitive again.’

Half a million Poles have settled in Britain since they acceded to the European Union in 2004.

Mr Cameron suggested Britain should no longer pay benefits to children living in Poland, whose parents are currently entitled to £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for the second one - far more generous payments than are paid in Poland.

In 2012, about 24,000 EU migrants claimed child benefit in Britain, whose children did not live in the country. But Miss Pomaska said it was unfair to treat Poles differently to British taxpayers.
