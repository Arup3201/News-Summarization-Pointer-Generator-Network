Police in Barnstable, Massachusetts, didnâ€™t have to go far to bring in a man accused of drunk driving.

Officers say they arrested 57-year-old Michael Sheehan of Arlington late on Friday night after he was spotted driving erratically in the rear parking lot of the police station.

Not only was was Sheehan allegedly drunk driving, but he was also trespassing in an area reserved exclusively for police vehicles.

Wrong place and wrong time: Michael Sheehan was arrested after drunk driving in a police parking lot in Massachusetts that was reserved exclusively for police vehicles

No access: The entrance to Barnstaple Police Station with a sign that reads 'Do not enter. Police vehicles only.' The intoxicated Brian Sheehan didn't comply

The entrance to Barnstable Police Department clearly states 'Do not enter. Police vehicles only' but the intoxicated Sheehan had ploughed on regardless, police said

Sheehan is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Barnstable District Court on charges of operating under the influence and trespassing.

An officer spotted Sheehan and at first thought he was a colleague arriving for the midnight shift.

But after noticing something was wrong and that Sheehan was driving around aimlessly, the policeman stopped him.

Authorities say Sheehan failed a field sobriety test. It was not immediately clear if Sheehan had a lawyer.
