He practically lived in the water, so friends of surfer Ben Linden, who was torn apart by a great white shark, said it was fitting they should say farewell him in the sea today.

Scores gathered at a beach in Perth to paddle out a short distance in memory of 24-year-old Mr Linden who was attacked by the 15ft shark while surfing off a beach 100 miles to the north of the city.

Lying across their surfboards, his friends – including members of a band he played for – and family members paddled out a short distance while a further 200 people remained on the beach.

Those who gathered under a picturesque blue sky were able to sign a surfboard and write messages on it before it was brought into the water.

Then they formed a ceremonial 
ring and cast flowers in the sea, while a bagpipe player gave a 
rendition of Waltzing Matilda from the sand dunes.

Mr Linden’s savage death shocked Western Australia because he was the fifth fatal shark attack victim off the coast in just 10 months.

Among the mourners gathered on the beach was Mr Linden’s godfather, Reverend John Hewitson, who said he was amazed at the large number of people who had turned out for the moving ceremony.

‘Many people have been touched by this tragedy,’ he told the crowd.

‘Today in Ben’s life and death we celebrate that love conquers death, life conquers fear, peace transforms terror.

‘And that through Ben’s life we are challenged to stay stoked and to live and love abundantly.’

Mr Linden’s girlfriend, Alana Noakes, who stood with Mr Linden’s elder sister Kelli, told the crowd on the beach: ‘Two weeks ago I lost the love of my life, my best friend, my rock, my inspiration.

‘But I am so grateful to have spent the last eight years creating memories and savouring every moment of being with Ben.

‘I am honoured to have grown up with 
him and most of all to have been loved by him. It is because of this 
that I am the luckiest person in the world.’

Mr Linden’s sister said that riding the waves was going to be more lonely now.

A
letter written by one of Mr Linden’s best friends, Peter Tuckey, who was 
unable to be at the gathering, was also read out: 'We never know 
when our clock is going to stop ticking,' the letter read.

'But if we did, we would live life to the fullest and Big Red was a living flagship of this statement.

'Let the sweet sounds of the ocean be your tune forever brother.'

Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore were also attacked by a shark when 
they went spearfishing off the western coast of Australia two weeks ago.

The episodes have cemented the west coast's reputation as the world's deadliest shark attack zone, according to The Independent.

Jet skiier Matt Holmes, 23, said he was towing a surfing friend along when he saw the attack.

'I
just took my mate straight to the shore and went straight out and there
was just blood everywhere and a massive, massive white shark circling 
the body.

‘By the time I got out there half of him had been taken.

‘I tried to lean off the side and 
pull him on the back, but as I did that the shark came back and nudged 
the jet ski to try to knock me off.

‘When I came back the second time, he took the rest of him.

‘I just thought about his family and if he had kids. I just wanted to get him to shore. I gave it everything I had.’

In Australia as a whole, an average of one person a year is killed by sharks. But Martin Garwood, a senior aquarist at the Sydney Aquarium, said
the spike in attacks is probably the result of human population growth 
and the increasing popularity of water sports in isolated locations, 
rather than a rise in shark numbers.
