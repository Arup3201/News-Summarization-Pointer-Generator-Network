David Cameron was today warned the Northern Ireland peace process is in 'state of stagnation' during his first bilateral talks with Sinn Fein leaders.

Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness used a 'frank' meeting with the British Prime Minister to claim he is not fulfilling his obligations under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

It is the first time Mr Cameron has held a one-on-one meeting with the republican party since coming to office, despite regularly holding individual talks with the DUP.

The Prime Minister hosted a meeting with the republicans in the House of Parliament, as negotiations continued over the outstanding peace process issues including flags, parades and the past in Northern Ireland.

It is the first time Mr Cameron has held a one-on-one meeting with the republican party since coming to office, despite regularly holding individual talks with the DUP.

Mr Adams said that Mr Cameron was aware there were 'difficulties' in the process and would meet Sinn Fein again in the autumn.

Speaking to reporters outside the Palace of Westminster, Mr Adams said: 'This is the first meeting that we have done as a Sinn Fein delegation with the British Prime Minister.

'We made the point to him that he is not fulfilling his obligations in terms of the Good Friday Agreement, that the process is in a state of stagnation at this time.'

Mr Adams said he had made the point to the governments in both Dublin and Westminster that they needed to demonstrate 'leadership and a fulfilment of their obligations'.

The meeting, and fresh talks at Stormont, come six months after marathon negotiations chaired by former US diplomat Richard Haass ended without agreement. 

Shortly after Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron convened an official meeting in Number 10 with Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister, Mr McGuinness.

He was joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and officials from both governments.

But later Mr Cameron held a separate meeting with Mr Adams and Mr McGuiness, the first time he has sat down with Sinn Fein alone since become Prime Minister.

Tensions have been heightened since Mr Adams was sensationally arrested in May over the murder of a widowed mother of ten who was abducted from her home during the Troubles more than 40 years ago.

He was questioned for four days by detectives investigating the murder of Jean McConville - abducted and killed by the Provisional IRA in 1972 and later buried on a beach in the Republic of Ireland.

After his release, Mr Adams condemned ‘sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign’ alleging his involvement in the killing.

His arrest came less than a month after Mr McGuiness’s historic handshake with the Queen at a reception for the Irish President during a state visit to Windsor Castle.

Mr McGuinness joined in a toast to the Queen during a State banquet at the castle.

As the meetings were held in Downing Street, talks got underway in Belfast aimed at resolving outstanding disputes as part of the peace process.

A three-day session of intensive negotiations focused on the outstanding peace process issues started at Parliament Buildings, Stormont. Another three day round of talks is scheduled for next week.

Delegations from the five parties in the power-sharing executive are trying to achieve some degree of progress and reduce community tensions before the biggest day of the loyal order marching season on July 12.

But with parties having seemingly entrenched positions on many of the issues, the prospects of a substantive deal before then appear slim.

Arriving for the talks, Sinn Fein's lead negotiator Gerry Kelly acknowledged there was public scepticism about what the negotiations would achieve.

'From our point of view we are setting the scepticism aside,' he said.

The renewed talks bid comes at Stormont six months after marathon negotiations chaired by former US diplomat Richard Haass ended without agreement.

While draft proposals outlined by Dr Haass remain on the table, with the party leaders having met periodically to discuss the outstanding issues since January, efforts to strike a deal in his absence have made little progress.

In recent years serious rioting has broken out in north Belfast in mid July linked to a contentious Orange Order parade on a short stretch of road next to a nationalist neighbourhood.

An imminent determination on whether that parade will be allowed to proceed this year hangs like a shadow over the new talks initiative at Stormont and has the potential to destabilise the process.

The talks involving the Democratic Unionists, Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Alliance Party are being facilitated by a senior civil servant.
