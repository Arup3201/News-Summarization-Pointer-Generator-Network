As ways of getting out of attending school go, this could well be unique.

A student was arrested after telling police she made a false bomb threat so her class would be cancelled and she could study for a test.

Alexxis C. Anthony, 19, of Lakeland, Florida, said she was involved in a bomb threat to Polk State College with her friend, Theron K. Brown Jr.

Call: Alexxis C. Anthony, 19, of Lakeland, Florida, said she was involved in a bomb threat to Polk State College with friend Theron K. Brown Jr.

Anthony told police she made the threat because she felt under pressure to keep her grades up because of a college scholarship.

The incident on July 28 evacuated the college’s Lakeland campus and was one of three bomb threats made against it in July, reported The Ledger.

But no explosive devices were found despite a threat that one would go off at 9:15am. Anthony was arrested on Tuesday.

Police say they expect more arrests and charges to be made, with the other two threats coming from the same mobile phone.

Brown's girlfriend Judeane Curry told investigators that he had called her on the morning of July 28 and said he wanted to make a bomb threat.

She told allegedly police he wanted to get her and Anthony out of school - but she dismissed his comment, reported The Ledger.

The bomb threats earlier last month on July 6 and July 20 forced the college to shut down four campuses, including Lakeland.

The first two threats were estimated to have cost the college more than $130,000 because of how many classes were cancelled.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said the investigation into the bomb threats is a ‘top priority’ because bomb threats ‘will not be tolerated’.

Anthony faces a charge of falsely reporting a bomb threat and her bail was set at $15,750, reported The Ledger.
