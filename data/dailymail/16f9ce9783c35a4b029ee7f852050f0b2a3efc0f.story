He was already in line for a five-figure windfall after finding a Rolex watch in a drain.

Now contractor Arron Large could treble his money to £60,000 after discovering three more expensive watches.

The 28-year-old spotted the first timepiece while jet-washing a roadside drain a week ago.

Finders keepers? Street cleaner Arron Large found a £21,000 Rolex in a drain but the owner has now stepped forward to claim it

Striking gold: Mr Large was cleaning a drain near Chalkwell train station in Essex when he saw a glimmer amongst the dirt. Three of the four watches he found turned out to be fakes

Rather than quietly pocketing it, he handed it in to police who told him he could keep it if no one claimed it within 30 days.

The day after speaking to the Daily Mail about his good fortune, he found an identical watch in a drain 100 yards away.

Hours later, another two watches 
turned up in the same place where he made his first lucrative discovery.
 Experts say the four watches would cost £60,000 to replace.

Mr Large, from Rayleigh, Essex, said: ‘I told my colleague, “You’re not going to believe me but I’ve found another one”.

‘He said “Shut up” but when I took it 
out and wiped it off, I realised it was another Rolex. Then I found the 
other two. It’s quite amazing.

'To be honest, it’s baffled everybody. 
Perhaps they were stolen and hidden there. Or maybe someone had a guilty
 conscience and dumped them there.’

Lady luck: Mr Large was rewarded for his 'honest and integrity' by the owner of the Rolex who did not want to be identified

Mr Large, a father of two who lives 
with his partner Rachel  Cozins, 25, added: ‘I’ve handed them in to the 
police and they are going to go through the records to see if they can 
find out who they belong to or if they are stolen.’

The first watch, which was in a drain 
near Chalkwell railway station in Essex, is an 18-carat gold Oyster 
Perpetual Cosmograph from Rolex’s Daytona collection, worth £21,000.

The
 second Rolex was found in a drain around the corner on Wednesday 
morning.

All in a day's work: Mr Large said he would not give up his job if he had ended up getting a payout because he enjoys it

Unusual finds: It's not the first time the pair have found strange things in their line of work

Mr Large, who works for waste 
management firm Cory Environmental, later returned to the first drain 
with a film crew and found two more watches – a Franck Muller and a 
limited-edition Omega Seamaster with the words ‘40 years of James Bond’
 engraved on the back.

Essex Police have established the first Rolex was made in Singapore and bought in Hong Kong. It has not been reported stolen.

A spokesman said: ‘We are keeping all 
lines of inquiry open, and these include the possibility that these 
watches may have been  hidden by a criminal looking to dispose of 
stolen goods.’
