Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez 'is a phenomenon' according to Real Madrid legend, and fellow Mexican, Hugo Sanchez.

Chicharito scored his first two Real Madrid goals in the 8-2 thrashing of Deportivo on Saturday, and the first in particular was a wonderful strike. 

And Sanchez, who scored over 200 goals for Real, told Spanish paper AS that the striker can lead the line for the European champions ahead of Karim Benzema. 

Real Madrid's dominant 8-2 win is the big story in Spain, with Marca claiming Ancelotti has the solutions

'He scored two great goals and I'm sure he will score many in Madrid,' Sanchez told AS. 'He's a phenomenon.

'[He is] very fast, intuitive, with movement and speed and he shoots well with his left and his right and his head.

'Il fenomeno', or 'the phenomenon' was the nickname given to Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who was one of the first era of galacticos and scored 83 La Liga goals in his four and a half seasons at the club. 

But Sanchez justified his praise by saying that, with confidence, Hernandez can be Real's first choice striker. 

'He is a player who intercepts the opponent very well and visualises what's happening next. What he needs to win a place under [Real coach] Carlo Ancelotti is what he did at Riazor. Confidence comes with goals.

'When he's given more time and more chances, hopefully he will be as effective as is required in Madrid.

'In this team there are enough chances created and that will help.'

'Benzema has quality and talent but his effectiveness percentage is not what you would expect from a centre forward' 

Barcelona's thrashing of Levante keeps their perfect start to the season going, with Lionel Messi in top form

Elsewhere in Spain Marca suggest Carlo Ancelotti has found a solution to Real Madrid's poor start by withdrawing a playmaker in central midfield.

The Madrid-based paper also brands Manchester United 'ridiculous' with a picture of their loan signing Falcao, who was a long-term target for Real Madrid. 

The Barcelona press lavish praise upon Luis Enrique's side after they thrashed Levante 5-0.

Mundo Deportivo describe the performance as a recital, saying 'Barca rout with a brilliant Messi, incomparable Neymar, and an indispensable Rakitic'. 

Sport meanwhile focus on Barca's brilliant start to the league season, with the Catalan giants yet to concede a goal, having scored 11 times in their four consecutive wins. 

Tuttosport say there's still plenty of Juve while Corriere dello Sport believe only Roma can stop the Old Lady

In Italy the focus is on the two sides with a 100% record as both Roma and Juventus continued their good start to the season.

'There's still plenty of Juve' says Tuttosport as the Serie A champions boast four wins out of four in all competitions without Pirlo, Vidal, Barzagli or Morata, and without conceding a goal.

Corriere dello Sport focuses on their title rivals Roma, who also won again this weekend, saying only Rudi Garcia's side can stop Juventus winning yet another title. 

L'equipe declares a state of emergency at Zlatan Ibrahimovic's PSG while Nani scores again in Protugal

French paper L'Equipe declare a 'State of Emergency' for PSG on their front page after they could only manage a 1-1 draw with Lyon.

The French champions, who spent £50m on David Luiz this summer, are three points off the pace already, and L'Equipe says the poor performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone cannot explain the malaise.

In Portugal the papers lead with convincing wins for Sporting and Benfica, with Manchester United loanee Nani on the scoresheet for the Lisbon side.
