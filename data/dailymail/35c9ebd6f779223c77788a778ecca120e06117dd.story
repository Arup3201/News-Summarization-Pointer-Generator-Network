It was much like any other Monday at Holywood Golf Club, though a few more people than usual were lingering around what they call Rory’s Corner.

That is probably selling it a bit short. For this is a mini-museum in the immaculately refurbished clubhouse that pays tribute to its most famous son, who on Sunday was crowned Open champion at Hoylake.

Somehow they now need to find space in the shrine to McIlroy’s career for a replica Claret Jug to go alongside that of the US Open trophy, his Ryder Cup golf bag, MBE medal and the picture of him winning the World Under-10 Championship.

Young champion: McIlroy grew up playing at the Holywood Golf Club in Northern Ireland

Yet, nobody was getting carried away here, not even down in the pleasant town he calls home, nestled by Belfast Lough, where the only signs of celebration were montages of the local hero in the hardware store and estate agent’s window.

Back at the club, members reminisced not just about the young Rory but the whole McIlroy clan who, over three generations, have become deeply woven into its fabric.

Jimmy Curtis was a close friend of Rory’s grandfather, Jimmy, who worked the cranes at the Harland and Wolff shipyard.

‘We were in the club’s snooker team together and we got our picture in the paper because all seven players were called Jimmy,’ recalled Mr Curtis, the team’s only survivor.

Jimmy McIlroy died suddenly after his retirement, leaving three sons - Brian, Colin and Gerry, the latter the father of Rory who also worked behind the club bar.

Colin and Gerry are both up on the board as past club champions, as is a 16-year-old Rory.

Past president Barry Dobbin showed the area by the bar where Rory, aged just two, would chip balls with a tiny club.

‘He was quiet and very well mannered - a nice boy,’ said Dobbin.

‘He was already good at seven and his father wanted him to join. I proposed him but the problem was that at the time the minimum age limit was 12.

'We had to change the club’s constitution to allow him to join, but it was a very close vote.’

A legacy of that was the large number of schoolchildren playing competitions there yesterday.

‘It seems to be a magnet for young golfers now,’ added Dobbin.

‘We also have a lot more Americans visiting here. They want to see where Rory came from and a few have become overseas members.’

Club general manager Paul Gray was the professional when the future superstar was just learning the game.

‘At eight Rory’s technique was very polished and by 13 he was probably better than me, to be honest,’ said Gray.

‘He used to come and play pro-ams with me, and I will always remember a shot he played at the Hilton course at Templepatrick that suggested he would be something special.

‘There was a fierce wind blowing across the hole and the pin was tucked away. He hit this four-iron from about 200 yards and somehow got it to hold its line to get to within a couple of feet.

‘It was the sort of shot that told you he would be outstanding - it was just a question of how good.’

Others, like his father, clearly felt the same, which is why some placed long-term bets on the young McIlroy to become Open champion by 26.

One of them, Wilbur Walker, is said to have collected £25,000 after Sunday and, with the subject of his foresight returning to Belfast on Monday, had cause for a huge celebration.
