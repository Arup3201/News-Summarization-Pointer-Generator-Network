Something very strange is happening in our skies. From Aberdeen to Devon, Llandudno all the way to Norwich, thousands of people reported hearing a series of loud bangs in the sky around 10.30pm on Saturday.

Many have described the mysterious noises as sounding like explosions or rumbles of thunder. Others thought they were similar to sonic booms — the sound a supersonic aircraft makes when it passes through the sound barrier.

Some said the bangs sounded more like a series of loud, crackling pops and so suspected fireworks. However, when they looked outside, none were to be seen.

Armageddon comes: Britain was shocked by a loud rumbling on Saturday night - is the end, perhaps, nigh?

As soon as the noises had ended, social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook, were buzzing with chatter about what the bangs could have been.

No one, it appeared, had a clue. But what made matters even more puzzling was that it emerged that a loud bang had been heard in Buffalo, New York — thousands of miles from Britain — around the same time.

So, what on earth could it have been?

There’s no doubt that as soon as an event like this occurs, it becomes hard to separate fact from fiction. Though social media is brilliant at spreading information quickly, it’s as fast at circulating incorrect stories.

Many attention-seekers falsely reported they had heard noises. Others innocently reported similar noises they heard at the same time for which there will be perfectly ordinary explanations — such as military training or, indeed, fireworks.

Fireworks were in Croydon (pictured) - but they were hardly loud enough to be heard nationwide

The most persuasive of these reports was the sound recording made by Claudia Angiletta, from Croydon, South London, who said she could not see any fireworks and was therefore baffled by the noises.

However, it emerged there was a large and very loud fireworks display for a wedding party on Saturday night at the Walcountians Sports Club, which is just four miles from the centre of Croydon. Saturday was a still night and the sound would have easily carried for miles.

But as fireworks in London are most certainly not loud enough to be heard in Aberdeen, Catherine wheels can’t possibly account for the nationwide reports of this seemingly other-worldly phenomenon.

Some of the explanations are positively outlandish, but we must consider them all for, as Sherlock Holmes famously observed: ‘When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’

The most bizarre accounts have been propagated by those who suspect the world is coming to an end.

According to a blog called The End Time, which seeks to chronicle ‘the end of days’, the noises may signal our doom.

‘I believe the booms are manifestations of spiritual warfare we happen to hear on this side of the veil or the preparations God is making for imminent tribulation judgments,’ says the blog.

You don’t need to be the atheist Richard Dawkins to dismiss such an explanation, but the idea that the noises are a manifestation of divine displeasure is widely accepted by many.

Thousands melodramatically used the Twitter hashtag — which signals a much- discussed topic — #OMG WeAreAllGoingToDie when they reported the bangs, though often in jest.

Other wild explanations involve aliens, as so many conspiracy theories do. A lack of corroborating visual evidence — such as spaceships or little green men — makes this harder to press home.

Theories: There was no shortage of ideas when it came to the possible source of the noises

Then there is The Hum theory. This is a widely reported low frequency noise that is said to occur in parts of Britain and North America.

There have been different reports of the noise for at least 40 years. For example, in 2011 in the village of Woodland in Co. Durham, residents claimed to be hearing it for days.

Often, there are rational explanations for The Hum, such as nearby factories or people suffering from tinnitus, but some occurrences remain genuinely mysterious.

However, what was heard on Saturday night was not a humming, but more of a series of explosions.

One of the more believable explanations is that the noises were caused by an ultra top secret American aeroplane that uses a ‘pulse detonation engine’ to power it to five times the speed of sound.

According to Dr Bhupendra Khandelwal, a scientist at Sheffield University working on the technology behind these engines, the strange sounds could have been made by such a plane.

‘When we run a test engine it’s a real industrial noise you can hear it for miles,’ he says.

No aircraft have used such engines to travel at supersonic speeds, though a persistent conspiracy theory maintains that the Americans have a plane called Aurora powered by pulse detonation.

As such theories go, Aurora is the oldest of chestnuts — it has been around for at least a quarter of a century.

A widespread version is that the Americans have secretly developed a hypersonic spy plane to replace the defunct Blackbird spy plane, and that it flies around the world on clandestine missions.

Of course, this conveniently ignores the fact that with increasingly sophisticated satellites, there is little or no need for the Americans to develop fearsomely fast — and expensive — manned aircraft.

It seems more plausible that Aurora was simply the name given to the project that developed America’s range of stealth aircraft, such as the B-2 bomber.

And even if there was such an aircraft, it is highly unlikely it would have been heard the length and breadth of Britain on Saturday night.

Could it be? An artist's image of the so-called Aurora project. Enthusiasts say one possible power source is a 'pulse detonation engine', whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip on Saturday

Theory: Aurora is rumoured to be a top secret aircraft in development since 1989. Last year Lockheed Martin announced it was developing a similar SR-72 spy plane (illustrated) said to be able to accelerate up to Mach 6

After all, there seems little point in developing an aeroplane quite so absurdly noisy.

Some suggested weather conditions, such as thunder, might be the source, but the Met Office dismissed this.

Another suggestion made by people pointing out that Britain has a severe terror warning in place is that the bizarre bangs were controlled explosions carried out by the police. But this is highly unlikely.

So, if is not secret planes, fireworks, God, the police or aliens, then what is the only possible explanation left?

The most plausible answer is simple and, surprisingly, has barely been considered.

The noises heard are likely to have been caused by a massive meteor entering the atmosphere above Britain.

Though we think of meteors as visual phenomenon, they do, in fact, make a noise — and the larger the meteor, the bigger the sound.

Compare the reports over the weekend to the eyewitness testimonies given in the East Riding of Yorkshire in December 1795 when a 56lb meteorite hit the ground near the village of Wold Newton.

A PDE engine works by using force from a series of explosions, caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake, to thrust itself forward. Its contrails appear to look like 'rings on a rope' (pictured), or a spine

‘I heard noises in the air like the report of cannon at a distance,’ said Mr L. Wilson. An 11-year-old boy called Charles Prestin also heard the sound, which he described as being like ‘the noise as of firing of cannon, heard at the above time a hissing in the air’.

Many local inhabitants thought the repeated noises were ‘guns at sea’.

Witnesses of other meteorite falls over the centuries have recorded hearing similar sounds. ‘A noise like thunder or the rolling of drums broke overhead, followed by a whizzing noise or the sound of escaping steam,’ said one.

All these reports from over the years sound extremely similar to those recounted over the weekend.

Dr Caroline Smith, the curator of meteorites at London’s Natural History Museum, agrees that the sound may have been made by a fireball — a meteor burning up as it hits the atmosphere.

One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom - a claim backed by expert Dr Caroline Smith

‘From what I’ve seen, it could be the noise effects from a fireball,’ she says. ‘You certainly get a series of explosions and it is possible this occurred over Britain on Saturday.’

What this does not explain is how the noise could be heard in the U.S.

The most rational explanation is that what was heard in upstate New York was something else — perhaps the sonic boom from an aircraft — and its timing was coincidental.

If the noises were made by a meteor and it landed in the UK, then somewhere there is going to be a very big crater.

However, it is more likely that whatever made the noise landed with a big splash and its secrets are at the bottom of the sea.

For those who don’t believe it was a meteor — and it does seem strange no airline pilots have reported any bright lights as they flew above the cloud cover — there can only be one explanation left.

It was Father Christmas on a practice run.
