Striker Aguero has scored 17 goals already this season for Manchester City

Aguero led the Manchester City line superbly in their 3-0 win at Southampton on Sunday

Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney and Real's Welsh star Gareth Bale were also nominated along with Barclays Premier League stars Thibaut Courtois, Branislav Ivanovic, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Angel di Maria, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard, Mesut Ozil, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa.

The controversy surrounding former Liverpool forward Luis Suarez at the World Cup - he was banned by world governing body FIFA after biting Giorgio Cheillini during Uruguay's clash with Italy - did not prevent him being nominated. 

The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Zurich on January 12.
