A gas engineer was trapped in the basement of a London charity shop for more than an hour after he discovered a four foot snake resting among bags of donations.

The engineer was visiting the British Heart Foundation shop, in Surbiton, London, when he found the corn snake slithering around the floor.

Shop manager John DeCastro said the gas man was trapped for more than an hour after he jumped on to an air conditioning unit, unaware of what species of snake it was.

Serpent: The 4ft corn snake was resting among bags of donations in the basement of the charity when it was discovered

He told MailOnline how he had just shown the engineer where the gas meter was when the snake was discovered.

He said: 'I turned around and said "that's not a real snake" but he said "it's just moved - don't touch it!"'

Mr DeCastro said he then contacted the police who arrived about an hour later.

He said: 'We were stuck down there for about an hour not knowing what to do.

'I was guessing whether it was real or not but then it moved properly and went towards the gas man.'

When the police arrived Sergeant Bob Whitehead simply picked the snake up and put it into a box.

Safe: Once the snake was safely put into a box it was taken to a nearby reptile store to be looked after

Sgt Whitehead told the Kingston Guardian how officers received a call from the shop saying the gas engineer was trapped by the snake.

He
said: 'I turned up, looked at it, had a look at the snake, and then 
basically went and picked him up by the back of the neck.'

The snake was then handed over to nearby store Reptile Kingdom.

Corn snakes are a harmless breed of reptile which can grow up to six feet in length and live for about 20 years.

They come from the Americas and are most often seen in the south eastern United States when they can be found living in fields, pine forests and agricultural areas.

They often hide and sleep during the daytime and are more active at dawn and dusk.

They are not venomous and do not tend to be aggressive.

Wild corn snakes often hunt small animals, birds and other reptiles.
