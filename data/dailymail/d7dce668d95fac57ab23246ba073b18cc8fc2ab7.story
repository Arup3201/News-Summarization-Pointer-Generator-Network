Southampton striker Graziano Pelle scored on his debut as Italy maintained their 100 per cent start in qualifying for Euro 2016.

Pelle put Italy ahead in the 24th minute when he poked the ball home after Pasqual's header had sparked a goalmouth scramble. 

Both Malta and Italy ended with 10 men. Malta captain Michael Mifsud was shown a controversial direct red card for a foul on Alessandro Florenzi in the 27th minute even though TV replays showed there was a minimal contact.

Minnows Malta, 155 in the FIFA rankings, put up stiff defensive resistance the rest of the way and Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci was sent off for foul on Andre Schembri whehn he was last man in the 73rd minute.

Bonucci will have to miss Italy's next Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia on November 16 in Milan.

Croatia and Italy lead with nine points each after three games.

'Having points in the table should give us confidence,' Italy coach Antonio Conte said. 'We won but we could have been more decisive in front of the goal. There's margin for improvement.'

Italy has won all four of its matches - including a friendly against the Netherlands - under Conte, who is yet to call up Mario Balotelli.

'We need to improve and we can improve,' Conte said. 'But four wins give us confidence.'

The top two finishers from the nine groups qualify automatically. The best third-placed team also qualifies automatically, and the other eight can qualify through a playoff.

Italy also struggled somewhat against Malta in their last two meetings, needing an injury-time goal to close out a 2-0 win in 2012 and saving a penalty in a win by the same score last year - both in World Cup qualifying.

This match was similar, and Malta nearly went ahead when Clayton Failla shot wide in the 15th.

That threat seemed to wake up the Azzurri, though, and Pelle and Giorgio Chiellini hit the crossbar and goal frame seconds apart in the 18th.

Then came Pelle's goal.

The 29-year-old also has five goals in eight matches for Southampton this season and, at 6 ft 4 in gives Conte a physical presence inside the area. 

Last season, Pelle scored 23 goals in 28 matches for Feyenoord in the Dutch league but was ignored by then-Italy coach Cesare Prandelli, who resigned after the Azzurri's first-round elimination from the World Cup in Brazil.

Antonio Candreva and substitute Sebastian Giovinco hit the goal frame in the second half.

The Azzurri sorely missed midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo, who was rested.

Malta are managed by Pietro Ghedin, an Italian who was formerly an assistant coach with Italy.
