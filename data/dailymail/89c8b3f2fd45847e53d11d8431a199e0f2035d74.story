A Scottish mother fell ill and died after jetting off for a Mediterranean holiday in a Turkish seaside resort.

Lorraine Macmurray, 38, was suddenly struck down with an illness while relaxing with partner Ian Dunn, 48, in Marmaris, not far from the island of Rhodes.

Mr Dunn told friends at home in Falkirk that his girlfriend 'got an infection' and was 'dehydrated', after she published a picture of herself laying in a hospital bed.

Sudden illness: Lorraine Macmurray, 38, was taken ill on her Turkish holiday, and later died. After being in hospital for a few days she posted a seemingly light-hearted picture of herself (right) in a hospital bed

She was taken ill in mid-July, but more than a fortnight later her family was horrified to find out that she had died.

It is unclear how or why Ms Macmurrary's condition deteriorated so suddenly, but the news was met with a wave of tributes from those who knew her.

One friend wrote on her Facebook page:'Time for bed after shock news today of Lorraine Macmurray's sad passing. Thoughts are with Ian and family.'

Another added: 'I'm shocked to hear you have lost your fight and been taken away far too soon. Sleep tight beside your mum and gran.'

Lorraine worked for a blinds company which Mr Dunn runs in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire.

The couple flew out to the Ekin Hotel in Marmaris at the beginning of July. The spot is just is just 10 minutes from the beach and close to bars and restaurants in the popular resort.

On July 9, she posted a picture of herself and Ian in a bar, commenting 'Whoosh….it's hot.'

But within a few days, it emerged that she was so ill that she couldn't fly home at the planned end of their holiday

After a blood transfusion, Ms Macmurray is believed to have been feeling better, but soon got much worse.

One update given to friends by Mr Dunn said :'She is not in a good place. Needing help from the big man upstairs. Everybody fingers crossed please.'

The news was confirmed on Saturday that Ms Macmurray had died. Mr Dunn tonight declined to comment. 

The Foreign Office said it was standing by to help Ms Macmurray's friends and family. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national on 2 August in Marmaris, Turkey. We have offered consular assistance at this difficult time.'
