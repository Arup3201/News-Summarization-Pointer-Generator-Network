Some residents in the Morris County community say 
they felt the quake in their homes. But for most, the event was over 
before most realized what was happening.

Bonnie Hook, thought the shaking might have been an explosion at the Picatinny Arsenal, which is just down the road.

'It shook the house,' Hook told NJ.com. She said that the quake lasted for about three seconds.

'I hope that's it,' Hook said. 'It was a little scary. We're not used to that in this area.'

While earthquakes in New Jersey are rare, Rockaway experienced several small ones last summer.

According to The Daily Record, Rockaway experienced several small earthquakes in June 2012.

Residents in the area heard loud and unexplained booms which a seismologist at Columbia University explained as small and shallow earthquakes, the largest of which was 1.1.Â
