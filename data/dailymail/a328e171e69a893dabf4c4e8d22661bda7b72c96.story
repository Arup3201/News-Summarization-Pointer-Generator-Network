Britons are getting more sophisticated when it comes to their pies, with more diners choosing upmarket gourmet pastries for their traditional meat treat at mealtimes. 

Sales of posh pies are going up as premium pies produced by celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal are boosting demand in the market, a study showed. 

Shoppers choosing to treat themselves at home instead of heading to the pub for a plate of the meat and mash combo have also pushed sales of posh pastries and pies.

Pie makers with their creative combinations and ingenious ingredients have reversed the dip in pie demand

Although volume sales of chilled pies were down 1.5 per cent, pioneering pie makers with their creative combinations and ingenious ingredients, have succeeded in bucking the trend, trade magazine The Grocer reported.

Their research showed brands that moved upmarket succeeded in reversing the overall downward dip in demand.

The upturn in sales was not just applicable to pie players such as Higgidy and Pieminister as supermarket own-label products were wooing the premium pie fanbase as well.

'For proof, just look at such offerings as Heston from Waitrose Pork & Piccalilli Pie with pepper, ginger and mace; Tesco Finest Slow Cooked Scotch Steak Pie; Asda Bistro Ultimate Steak & Ale Pie or the Chicken, Bacon & Mushroom pie in the new top-tier M&S frozen foods range,' The Grocer said.

Brands like Higgidy are taking the credit for the humble pie's push to the posher end of the spectrum

Charles Coleman, co-founder of branded and own-label supplier Deli Sante says that such products can hold their own against brands and even pub grub.

He told the magazine: 'As the economy improves, people invest a bit more when they shop. Our products are similar to the fare you would find in a good pub.'

But brands take the credit for beginning the humble pie's push to the posher end of the spectrum.

Mark Campbell, managing director of Higgidy said: 'For many years the pie category had been "value engineered", quality and innovation had dropped, and the category haemorrhaged consumers.

'However, activity at the premium end has reinvigorated the category and started to bring consumers back.'

Posh pies have also benefited from the recession as people have changed their eating habits, according to Ginster sales and marketing director Linda Evans.

She told The Grocer: 'There is evidence that consumers, while cutting back on dining out, have been prepared to spend more money on treating themselves with meal solutions in the home.'
