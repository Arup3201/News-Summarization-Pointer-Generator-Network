The ‘sex slave’ who claims she was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew was promised she would ‘be looked after’ if she kept quiet, bombshell court documents allege.

Virginia Roberts said she was contacted by lawyers acting for billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein just a week after she was interviewed by the FBI about allegations of sex abuse at his Florida mansion.

Epstein’s legal team ‘tracked her down’ to Australia, leaving her ‘terrified’, before apparently trying to secure her silence, according to a transcript of a telephone interview she had with lawyers in 2011.

Miss Roberts said she was warned any of the victims who did not comply would be smeared as ‘drug addicts and prostitutes’.

Miss Roberts, who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 and 2002, also expressed her disgust at a photograph which showed the royal and Epstein walking together in Central Park after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail.

‘I am angry about how they are still up to their old ways together and that they’re still hanging out,’ she said, adding that the Duke of York ‘would know a lot of the truth’.

Describing the conversation with Epstein’s lawyers, she said: ‘He told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that “I’ll be looked after”.

‘And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn’t like you know, “I’m gonna pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet”, but if I stay quiet, I would [be] “looked after”.’

Miss Roberts, who is now 30 and has now returned to her native America, said she was then called again by the lawyers a week later and was put on to Epstein.

The financier apparently showed no remorse, dismissing the girls he allegedly assaulted as ‘drug addicts’ who were ‘just after the drug money’.

‘He exactly repeated what the lawyer said the week before,’ Miss Roberts added.

‘That he would look after me if I stayed quiet, and if I need any help, you know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get legal help for me, whatever I need, he would do.

‘Apparently there was an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that Jeffrey had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes so they wouldn’t be looked upon as worthy in the court’s eyes.’

Miss Roberts claims she told Epstein she did not ‘want to be a part of it’ and would not speak out.

The comments were made in a telephone interview from April 2011 with lawyers acting for Epstein’s victims, who were gathering evidence after the billionaire’s legal team mounted a counter legal action.

A further document uncovered by the Mail shows how Miss Roberts was ‘terrified’ after being tracked down by the lawyers.

In a ‘complaint and demand for jury trial’ filed in May 2009, lawyers acting for Miss Roberts stated: ‘Suddenly, in 2008, [Miss Roberts] received numerous phone calls from the defendant’s agents. ‘Terrified by [Epstein’s] demonstrated ability to track her down on her cell phone number halfway across the world, [Miss Roberts] attempted to reassure [Epstein’s] agent that she would remain quiet. [Epstein] himself spoke on the phone and thanked her for not getting involved.’

In the document, Miss Roberts’s lawyers claimed she was abused by ‘royalty’, ‘politicians’ and ‘academicians’ who were friendly with Epstein.

‘In addition to being continually exploited to satisfy [Epstein’s] every sexual whim, [Miss Roberts] was also required to be sexually exploited by [Epstein’s] adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances,’ they stated.

‘Whenever [Epstein] transported [Miss Roberts] with him in his private jet to any destination, [Epstein] would pay [Miss Roberts] a flat rate per day while he and/or his abovementioned associates would sexually exploit and abuse minor [Miss Roberts],’

The new documents can be revealed after the Daily Mail told of the extraordinary scale of the cover-up over the underage sex crimes committed by Epstein, a friend of the Duke of York, 54.

At one stage, he even ordered a pilot to re-direct his private plane because he was concerned the FBI were looking for one of the girls on board.

He allegedly told his victims ‘bad things’ would happen to them if they spoke out.

Investigators believe Epstein was desperate to stop the witnesses being called to give evidence before a Federal Grand Jury, where they may have been granted immunity from prosecution to tell the truth.

Instead, he hired an ‘army of legal superstars’ to persuade prosecution lawyers to sign a controversial plea agreement.

Many of the charges against Epstein and any ‘co-conspirators’ were removed in return for him pleading guilty to a relatively minor charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution, for which he served just 13 months in jail.

The lawyers, meanwhile, were accused of carrying out a campaign of intimidation, using ‘aggressive witness tampering’.

A girl approached by Florida detectives investigating Epstein in October 2005 told them she had already been approached by a private investigator working for Epstein.

‘[The girl] provided no additional information as it appeared her responses were almost scripted,’ a police affidavit stated.

Another girl was threatened after being sexually abused by Epstein at his Florida mansion aged 15.

The police affidavit adds: ‘Epstein told [the girl] that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen.

‘[The girl] wanted to notify authorities, however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.’

In a document titled ‘Statement of Undisputed Facts’ drawn up by a US state Attorney on September 18, 2007, a prosecutor also described how two FBI agents went to the home of Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff the month previously to serve her with a Federal Grand Jury subpoena in relation to the Epstein investigation.

Ms Groff disappeared upstairs and then rang Epstein, who told her not to speak to agents and ‘reprimanded her’ for allowing them into her home.

Epstein was aboard his privately owned civilian aircraft in Miami and then had it diverted in case detectives were looking for Nadia Marcinkova, a girl who was on board.

‘During the course of that flight, the defendant verbally abused Ms Marcinkova, harassing and pressuring her not to cooperate with the grand jury’s investigation,’ the document states.

Epstein also ‘threatened and harassed’ his other personal assistant Sarah Kellen to stop her from co-operating with the FBI against him, according to the prosecutor.

Buckingham Palace, which has said the Duke emphatically denies the claims, said it would not be making any further comment.
