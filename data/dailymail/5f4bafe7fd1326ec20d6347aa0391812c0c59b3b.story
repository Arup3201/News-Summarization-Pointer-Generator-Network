Only one in eight of the couples and individuals who try to adopt children are approved by social workers, official figures revealed yesterday.

The shocking statistics mean that more than 22,000 would-be adoptive parents vanish from the system every year.

The figures were made public for the first time by the schools and children inspectorate Ofsted. They were released just three weeks after the government-sponsored National Adoption Week called for thousands more people to come forward to adopt.

The Ofsted count showed that in the year which ended in March, 25,380 couples and individuals made inquiries about adopting a child.

Of these, only 4,145 (16 per cent) went on to make applications to adopt a child. Even fewer - 3,048 - were actually approved as prospective parents by council or agency social workers.

The drop-out rate has been revealed at a time when ministers have promised to sweep away the barriers to adoption put up by social workers over the past three decades.

Parents have been regularly turned down because social workers insist on precise racial matches, and white parents are routinely rejected as adopters of black or Asian children. Potential parents are also turned down because they smoke, or are too old, or social workers say their health is not good enough.

The Ofsted breakdown, based on returns from councils and  voluntary adoption agencies, gave the same figure as Whitehall for the number of children adopted from the care system last year – 3,450.

About 65,000 children live in state care, either in children’s homes or with frequently changing foster families.

Children who grow up in care are likely to grow up with poor education and have a high chance of falling into drug abuse, crime or early pregnancy.

Despite regular warnings that adoption placements often break up, the Ofsted figures showed that there were only 115 ‘unplanned endings’ of adoption placements during the year.

The disappearance of the great majority of people who hoped to adopt a child provoked demands for explanations yesterday.

Adoption researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘How are you going to recruit people to adopt children if nobody knows why people are dropping out?

‘We are not being told whether people are being turned down or put off. We do not know what criteria are used to approve or reject people.

We do not know to what extent the decisions are made on grounds of race, age, health or people’s opinions. We need to know.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are making the adoption system as welcoming and helpful as possible so that those who want to adopt are supported and encouraged.

‘We are setting up a new national information service, called a gateway, for prospective adopters.

‘With a website and helpline from early next year, it will give a consistent service across the country.

'The Government is reforming adoption to make the process swifter and place children in care with loving families.’

Ministers have promised to sweep away barriers to adoptive parents over recent months, and in particular they have said race rules will go.

The barriers to adoption have helped push down the number of children who find new families from 20,000 a year in the 1970s to few more than 3,000 now.

The Ofsted figures showed that 92 per cent of people approved to adopt were white, while 78 per cent of children in care and 85 per cent of children who are adopted are white.

Anyone who hopes to adopt a child must go through a lengthy process.

The first step is to contact the council or an adoption agency. Couples or individuals are then sent an information pack with material about how the process works and children up for adoption.

Would-be parents then go on a preparation course to ‘give an insight into what adoption means today’, followed by a home visit by a social worker.

The worker will ‘discuss and explore why you want to adopt, the kind of child you would best be able to care for, and your overall suitability. References will be sought and checks made’.

An adoption panel considers the social worker’s report, and once adoptive parents are approved, they are linked with a child.

Adoptive parents are given details about the child’s  background before meeting him or her.

If all goes well, the child moves in with the new parents and a court gives legal approval to the adoption.
