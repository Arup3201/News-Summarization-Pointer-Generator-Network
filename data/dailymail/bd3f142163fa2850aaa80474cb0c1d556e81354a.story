Human remains discovered in Russia are thought to be those of sailors from a British trawler which disappeared nearly 40 years ago.

Family members of those missing have been asked to provide DNA samples after the remains of up to ten bodies were handed to Russian authorities.

The Gaul sank in 1974 during a fierce storm off the coast of Norway with the loss of her 36-man crew – but only four bodies were ever found.

Investigation: Tests are being carried out to discover whether human remains found in Russia are those of missing sailors from a trawler which sank in 1974

The ship’s demise in the Barents Sea 
has been the subject of speculation, with persistent claims that it was 
sunk by the Russians over alleged spying activities. 

It
has now emerged that villagers found up to ten bodies in the 1970s but 
covered them up and did not inform the Russian authorities until much 
later.

The latest 
development is likely to fuel speculation on why it has taken this long 
for the British government to be made aware of the discovery.

A
police statement said the remains were found on the Rybacky Peninsula 
in the Murmansk region of Russia in 1974 or 1975 by people living 
nearby.

It is understood that a local custom was to use rocks to cover 
the bodies of unknown  seafarers, because freezing conditions meant it 
was impossible to dig proper graves.

Missing: Humberside Police said investigations are being carried out to determine whether the remains discovered on Russia's Rybachy peninsular in 1974 or 1975 were connected to the Gaul

Mystery: Specially trained officers have visited the families of those involved and they have been given the details known about the remains and the ongoing forensic and genetic examinations

It
is not clear why the discovery was not reported at the time, which 
happened at the height of the Cold War when tensions between Britain and
Russia were high.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office were only told about the remains in July 2012.

Humberside
Police said investigations were being carried out to determine whether 
the remains were connected to the Gaul, which was based in Hull.

Beryl
Betts, whose brother Billy Jones was a 26-year-old deckhand on the 
trawler, said she had ‘mixed feelings’ about the development.

Mrs Betts,
74, from Hull, said officials should have waited until they were 
certain the bodies were from the Gaul before approaching the families.

When
the Gaul disappeared, there was no distress message and the only 
wreckage recovered at the time was a buoy.

The vessel was discovered in 
1997 after a privately funded seabed survey. The remains of James Wales,
Maurice Spurgeon, Stanley Collier and Clifford Briggs were found in 
2002.
