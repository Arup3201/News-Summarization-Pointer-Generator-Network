As the toll in the saline murder inquiry rose to five yesterday, detectives were set to review dozens of other deaths at Stepping Hill Hospital.

The inquiry escalated as another of the 14 patients whose saline is suspected of having been tampered with, 83-year-old Derek Weaver, died yesterday morning.

Tonight police named Vera Pearson, 84, as the fifth victim to be linked to the investigation.

She was not one of the 14 patients police 
initially believed had been treated with 36 vials of saline contaminated
with insulin, raising fears there could be yet more victims.

The pensioner's family said they wanted to be left alone to grieve in peace.

Her death on July 14 was referred to detectives by a coroner earlier this week because of her low blood sugar level. Police say saline solution at the hospital was contaminated with insulin, which can cause low blood sugar.

A further patient, a 41-year-old  man, has improved slightly but remains 'poorly'.

A police source said: 'Although the focus of our investigation is
the deaths that have occurred this month, we will be reviewing a number
of deaths at the hospital over the last few weeks and months to see if 
there is anything suspicious about them.

Detectives have been given until 9pm 
tonight to continue to question nurse Rebecca Leighton on suspicion of 
murdering three patients, George Keep, 84, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and 
Tracey Arden, 44.

Victim: Vera Pearson, 84, who is the fifth person whose death is being linked to allegations of sabotage at Stepping Hill Hospital

Yesterday her fiancé, friends and family took to the internet to protest her innocence, with her fiancé's mother writing: 'We all believe in you.'

The alarm was raised last Tuesday when an experienced nurse reported a higher than normal number of patients with 'unexplained' low blood sugar levels.

Concerns that controlled drugs were not 
kept securely on the wards at the centre of the current inquiry were 
highlighted by an internal report earlier this year.

The clinical audit, seen by the Daily
Mail, found that cupboards in which medicines were stored on wards A1 
and A3 were not routinely locked.

It also revealed that staff on ward A3 did not check their supplies of controlled drugs on a daily basis.

The
proportion of keys to locked medicine cupboards held by the appropriate
staff had dropped from 100 per cent the previous year to 84 per cent.

Last night the trust said it had reacted by retraining staff, replacing faulty locks and redistributing keys.

Security at the hospital has been drastically increased, with medics working in pairs to minimise the chance of foul play.

None
of the deaths has so far been definitively linked to insulin 
contamination and while further toxicology reports are awaited, police 
are classifying all five as 'suspicious'.

Chameleon: Miss Leighton, who was arrested in a dawn raid, shows off her different looks on camera

Miss Leighton, 27 - herself born at Stepping Hill - was described by colleagues as 'dedicated'.

She was arrested at 6am on Wednesday in the flat she shares with her fiancé Tim Papworth, 28, a 15-minute walk from Stepping Hill.

Her Facebook profile revealed she enjoyed getting drunk on wine on days off and dreaded night-shifts at the hospital lasting as much as 14 hours.

Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said that the deaths of two elderly patients were being linked to the ongoing investigation

Last night Miss Leighton's uncle, Geoffrey Sweetman, 54, a Cadbury's worker of Bourneville, Birmingham, said: 'Becki is a lovely girl, she's good-hearted, a friendly and loving family member.

'I do not believe she is a murderer.'

Miss Leighton was inspired to become a nurse by her mother Lynda, a nurse trainer at Stepping Hill, ex-colleagues said.

Rebecca Leighton's Facebook pages tell of a frantic social life that helped her cope with the stress of work.

Her Facebook page is littered with entries about not looking forward to work

Retired senior staff nurse Valerie Rowlinson, 61, said: 'Initially she was a healthcare assistant but she desperately wanted to make the step up so she did the Open University nursing degree to become a fully-qualified nurse.

'I always found her very committed and diligent. She is a good nurse in my opinion and the whole thing has left me shocked.'

Miss Leighton - who was registered as a nurse in 2008 - is understood to have temporarily held an acting position as ward sister.

Messing around: The nurse has been described as a 'polite and caring'

The latest suspected victim, Derek Weaver, was a retired businessman who lived near the hospital.

He is understood to have deteriorated suddenly after suffering a serious low blood sugar episode on July 11, the day before the inquiry was launched.

Last night Mr Weaver's sister, Lynda Bleasdale, said she was horrified by the allegations.

'I'm absolutely sick that anybody could do that,' she said.

'Everyone in the hospital has said what a charming, lovely gentleman he is. The staff have been absolutely wonderful with him.'

Greater Manchester Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins stressed that there had been no further acts of contamination at the hospital since the start of inquiries.

'As with the deaths of George Keep, Arnold Lancaster and Tracey Arden, the cause of this man and woman’s death is not known and it is important we do not lose sight of this fact,' he said.

Mr Hopkins predicted that police would be asked to investigate other deaths at the hospital.

The 'fast-moving' investigation has revived memories of Beverley Allitt, who was convicted of murdering four children and trying to kill nine others at a Lincolnshire hospital in the early 1990s.

She injected some of her victims with insulin.

Party-loving: Rebecca Leighton's social life was catalogued on Facebook

Friends and family of Rebecca Leighton turned to the internet to protest her innocence.

After the nurse's party-loving lifestyle came under scrutiny due to her numerous entries on social networking websites, they launched a campaign of support.

Pleading with her to stay strong, they said they did not believe she could have carried out the murders.

And her fiancé, Tim Papworth used his father's Facebook profile to thank everyone for their support.

His mother, Heather Papworth, wrote: 'Innocent, we all believe in you bekki, love you loads. No she hasn't done it and she will be holding her head high, love you bekki xx'.

Friend Leah Hunt wrote: 'The most kind hearted person in the world ur fantastic person great friend n brilliant nurse love u loads becki n don't believe one word of it ur amazin keep ur chin up babe we are all thinking of u honey stay storng ur in my heart and prays. X'

Using her nickname, Spuggy, Sarah Warburton wrote: 'Can't stop thinking about what your going through Spuggy! They couldn't be more wrong'.

And friend Diane Rothwell wrote: 'Becki, the news is totally insane ... You would never hurt a fly and I cannot understand this.'
