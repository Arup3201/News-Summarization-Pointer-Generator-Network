Arsenal face an uphill battle to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League when they take on Monaco but Arsene Wenger's men should take heart from some previous European comebacks.

The Gunners must score at least three away goals on Tuesday as they look to overturn the 3-1 defeat they suffered at the Emirates late last month.

Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at 10 of the greatest second leg comebacks in European competition.

Chelsea 4-1 Napoli (Agg 5-4 after extra-time), Champions League last 16, March 14, 2012

Chelsea looked dead and buried after a dismal 3-1 defeat in Naples but, after the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas, the Blues stormed back to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.

Goals from Didier Drogba and John Terry had Roberto Di Matteo's men in control before Gokhan Inler's strike in the 55th minute put the visitors in charge.

Frank Lampard levelled the tie with a 75th minute penalty and Branislav Ivanovic popped up in extra-time with a thumping finish to continue Chelsea's charge towards the trophy.

Fulham 4-1 Juventus (Agg 5-4), Europa League last 16, March 18, 2010

Fulham also suffered a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of this tie but the Cottagers didn't require extra-time to make it through to the last eight of the Europa League in style.

David Trezeguet's goal appeared to have ended the contest early on but strikes from Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera - either side of a red card for Fabio Cannavaro - had Roy Hodgson's men back in it.

Gera netted another from the penalty spot before Clint Dempsey sealed Fulham's progress with a delightful chip beyond the helpless Antonio Chimenti.

Deportivo 4-0 AC Milan (Agg 5-4), Champions League quarter-final, April 7, 2004

AC Milan could be forgiven for thinking this tie was as good as over after their 4-1 first leg win at the San Siro but Deportivo had other ideas.

The Spanish side wiped out the visitors' advantage with first-half goals from Walter Pandiani, Juan Carlos Valeron and Albert Luque, putting themselves in the driving seat on away goals.

The Serie A outfit had no answers and substitute Gonzalez Fran added a fourth goal 15 minutes from the end to seal Deportivo's place in the last four.

Fernando Morientes mocked Real Madrid's decision to send him out on loan as he dumped his parent club out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage.

After scoring in a 4-2 first leg defeat at the Bernabeu, the Spaniard struck again after goals from Real striker Raul and team-mate Ludovic Guily.

The Frenchman netted his second goal of the evening with a clever backheel to secure victory on away goals and set up a semi-final clash with Chelsea.

Bayern Munich 2-3 Inter Milan (Agg 3-3), Champions League last 16, March 15, 2011

After beating Bayern Munich in the Champions League final the season before, Inter Milan once again had the last laugh against the Bundesliga giants.

Mario Gomez's late strike had given Louis van Gaal's men victory and an away goal in the first leg but Samuel Eto'o cancelled out Bayern's advantage after just three minutes.

Gomez and Thomas Muller put the hosts 3-1 up on aggregate but a second-half goal from Wesley Sneijder and 88th minute winner from Goran Pandev sent Inter through on away goals.

Middlesbrough 4-1 Basle (Agg 4-3), UEFA Cup semi-final, April 6, 2006

Middlesbrough made a habit of dramatic comebacks in their successful run to the UEFA Cup final in 2006 but this was perhaps the best.

Steve McClaren's men were 2-0 down from the first leg and trailing 1-0 on the night before two goals from Mark Viduka, another from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and a last minute strike by Massimo Maccarone sent them through.

Boro produced another brilliant come-from-behind win in the semi-finals, seeing off Steaua Bucharest 4-2 on aggregate after being 3-0 down 24 minutes into the second leg.

Barcelona 1-4 Metz (Agg 5-6), UEFA Cup Winners' Cup first round, 1984

No French TV or radio stations bothered to send anyone to this game after Barcelona's comfortable 4-2 victory in the first leg in France.

But after going 1-0 down on the night Metz rallied, scoring four unanswered goals to sensationally beat Barca at the Nou Camp and progress to the second round 6-5 on aggregate.

Striker Tony Kurbos netted a hat-trick as Bernd Schuster was left to rue his words after the first leg when he offered to 'give the Metz players some ham to thank them for all the presents they’ve given to us tonight'.

Valencia 5-0 Basle (Agg 5-3 after extra-time), Europa League quarter-final, April 10, 2014

Paco Alcacer was the hero for Valencia as they overturned a three-goal first leg deficit to reach the last four of the Europa League.

The talented striker netted either side of an Eduardo Vargas strike as the hosts forced an extra 30 minutes following their 3-0 defeat in Switzerland.

Alcacer completed his hat-trick in the 113th minute before Juan Bernat wrapped things up with just a couple of minutes to play against nine-man Basle.

Real Madrid 4-0 Borussia Monchengladbach (Agg 5-5), UEFA Cup third round, 1985

Real Madrid appeared on the brink of exiting the UEFA Cup at the third round stage after being thrashed 5-1 in the first leg in Germany.

But Los Blancos turned things around at the Bernabeu as braces from Jorge Valdano and Santillana meant the hosts progressed on away goals.

Real Madrid went on to the lift the trophy after a two-legged victory over Videoton of Hungary.

David Villa's 55th minute strike proved decisive as Jordi Alba added gloss to the scoreline with a goal just before the final whistle.

Barca progressed to the semi-finals after beating Paris Saint-Germain but were then humiliated by Bayern Munich, losing 7-0 on aggregate.
