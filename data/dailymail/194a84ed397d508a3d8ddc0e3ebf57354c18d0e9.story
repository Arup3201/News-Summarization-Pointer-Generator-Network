Bizarre: Delaware police arrested 49-year-old Ronald Johnson for allegedly stealing 72 pounds of frozen chicken from a delivery truck and then stashing it at a nearby children's day care

Delaware police arrested a man they say stole 72 pounds of whole frozen chickens then stashed them at a day care.

Ronald Johnson, 49, allegedly stole the poultry from a truck making a grocery delivery in Wilmington Friday. Officers say the man hid the chickens at a day care behind the grocery and fled.

Authorities Johnson later returned to the day care, but was confronted by an employee, who Johnson then stabbed on the back and hand with a knife.

Anthony Kinard,38, is the son of Ertha Kinard, who runs the day care center. He told Philadelphia's Fox 29 about the ordeal.

'Any
 son would defend their mom no matter what so that's what's going 
through my head,' said Kinard, whose mother was busy trying to keep the 
day care's children from seeing the bizarre scene.l

While he tried to keep the suspect at bay, police say Mr. Kinard was stabbed by Johnson with a steak knife in the arm.

'This
 basically is cut here its open and its broke here,' the victim said as 
he showed Fox 29 his injuries. Kinard broke his hand when he fell down 
during the alleged attack.

Mrs. Kinard managed to call police during the encounter, who pursued Johnson and arrested him after a foot chase.

'He
 tried to keep an eye on him not to fight him, but to keep an eye on him
 until the police come,' Mrs. Kinard said. 'A whole box a whole box of 
chicken they had not been cut up.'

Johnson is charged with assault and theft.

Police gave the chickens back to the delivery driver.
