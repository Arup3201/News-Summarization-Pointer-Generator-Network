First came the low, cultured hum of the Formula One racing car engine; then rolling thunder as the rocket fired up.

A plume of flame shot out for ten seconds and the roar at the nozzle reached an estimated 186 decibels – louder than a Boeing 747 at take off. Indeed, the racket from the rocket was later claimed to be the loudest man-made noise anywhere in the world.

Such is the awesome power of the British supercar which aims to shatter the land speed record next year.

The moment that scientists at RAF St Mawgan near Newquay, Cornwall test fired the first new rocket built in Britain for 20 years, which will power the 1,000mph Bloodhound

Four years after the 
project began, the rocket system which the designers hope will help 
Bloodhound SSC (supersonic car) smash through the 1,000mph barrier has been 
tested for the first time.

At 12 feet long, 18 inches in diameter
and weighing just under 1,000lb, the rocket is the largest of its kind 
ever designed in Europe and was the biggest to be fired in the UK for 20
years. Yesterday, it was bolted to the floor for the test in a 
bomb-proof hangar at Newquay Airport, Cornwall, and was only operating 
at half capacity.

But next year, if all goes well when 
it is fitted inside the £10million car, the rocket will send the 
gleaming orange and blue machine racing to 1,050mph.

In the hangar it was surrounded by a 
‘water deluge system’ in case it exploded and concrete blocks separated 
it from other parts of the engine. ‘If it blows up, at least we’ll save 
something,’ said one engineer. Guests were invited to watch via a video 
link in a nearby hangar and around 120,000 people around the globe 
viewed it online.

In its ultimate form the rocket will 
generate around 27,500lb of thrust – equivalent to about 80,000 
horsepower, the combined output of 95 Formula One cars. Earplugs were 
available yesterday, a wise precaution given that the rock concert said 
to be the loudest ever – a 1976 show by The Who – reached a mere 126 
decibels.

The assault on the record is due to 
take place in the South African desert at Hakskeen Pan, the site in 1929
of one of Sir Malcolm Campbell’s many attempts. If Bloodhound succeeds,
it will reach 1.4 times the speed of sound – fast enough to get from 
Land’s End to John o’Groats in 51 minutes.

It would also see RAF pilot Andy 
Green, 50, who will drive Bloodhound, smash his existing land speed 
record by more than 200mph and become the first man to drive through the
1,000mph barrier. Should the target of 1,050mph be reached, it will 
also beat the low-altitude speed record for aircraft of 994mph.

Mr Green described what he faces at 
the controls: ‘2G acceleration, then 3G deceleration. 2G is the 
equivalent of 0 to 60mph in 1.5 seconds. 3G is the equivalent of coming 
to a complete stop from 60mph in one second – what most people would 
call an average car crash.

'Then all I have to do is control three 
engines and keep it going in a straight line.’

Up to a speed of 350mph, 
it will be powered by a Eurofighter jet engine. A Cosworth V8 racing car
engine is there to pump peroxide fuel into the rocket. A catalyst in 
the rocket then causes a chemical reaction which generates a temperature
of 600C and the rocket ignites, giving the car the massive boost it 
needs to hit 1,050mph after 40 seconds.

Then, 3.5 seconds and one mile later, it will start to decelerate.

Project team leader Richard Noble said the successful tests were a ‘major milestone’.

A replica version of the Bloodhound was also on display at RAF St Mawgan near Newquay, where 400 people gathered to watch the rocket test

The Ministry of Defence is backing the project, and Whitehall chiefs hope young people will be inspired to get involved in science, technology, mathematics and engineering.

A team of five REME (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) experts will help build and maintain the car over the next two years in the UK, and be on hand during the record attempts in South Africa next year and in 2014.

Philip Dunne, minister for defence equipment, support and technology, said nurturing engineering skills in youngsters is vital to British industry, and the project is a good opportunity for the Army to share its experience and skills.

‘That experience will feed directly back into the front line as they progress through their Army careers,” he said.

Richard Noble, the project director of Bloodhound, said: ‘We are delighted that the MoD and REME will be joining us and sharing in this unique adventure.

‘Their young engineers have great skills and attitude and will make a tremendous contribution to the building and running of the car.’
