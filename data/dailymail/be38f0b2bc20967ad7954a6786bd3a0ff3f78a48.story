Families of Hillsborough victims reacted with outrage yesterday after it was revealed Merseyside Police told Margaret Thatcher the disaster was caused by drunken Liverpool fans.

Leaked documents show how senior officers blamed disorderly supporters just days after the 1989 stadium tragedy which left 96 dead.

At least one Liverpool-based policeman said he was ‘ashamed’ of the spectators’ behaviour.

Former chief constable: Sir Kenneth Oxford with his wife Muriel after receiving a CBE

The briefings contrast with the findings of the official inquiry, which pinned the blame on officers responsible for crowd control at the FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground.

Supporters’ groups have been pushing for all documents surrounding the tragedy to be published, claiming there was an attempt to cover up police failings and discredit fans.

Yesterday it emerged that four days after the disaster, a member of then-prime minister Mrs Thatcher’s policy unit met Merseyside officers for their views on the cause.

According to the document, leaked to the BBC, chief constable Sir Kenneth Oxford told the adviser: ‘A key factor in causing the disaster was the fact that large numbers of Liverpool fans had turned up without tickets.

‘This was getting lost sight of in attempts to blame the police, the football authorities, etc.’

Another – unnamed – officer was said to have directly blamed the supporters.

‘One officer, born and bred in Liverpool, said that he was deeply ashamed to say that it was drunken Liverpool fans who had caused this disaster, just as they had caused the deaths at Heysel,’ the note said.

The document is initialled ‘MT’, suggesting it was read by Mrs Thatcher, and the phrase ‘drunken Liverpool fans’ is underlined by hand.

Tragedy: Ninety-six people died at the Hillsborough disaster in 1989

Thirty-nine died at the Heysel stadium in Belgium in 1985 when Liverpool supporters charged Juventus fans.

Although the inquest into the Hillsborough deaths was told that vast quantities of alcohol had been consumed before kick-off, the official Taylor Report blamed the tragedy on blunders by South Yorkshire officers policing the match.

It said opening an exit gate just before kick-off enabled hundreds of fans to pour into a full ‘pen’ on the terraces, causing the fatal crush.

The Hillsborough Independent Panel, set up in 2009, is reviewing all official papers relating to the disaster with a view to their release later this year.

Blame: Another policeman also said Liverpool fans were responsible for the deaths, according to the document

Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said last night: ‘We are obviously disgusted with the views of Merseyside Police but to some of us that will come as no surprise.’

And Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died in the stadium, said the note confirmed her fears of an attempted cover-up.

‘The thing I’m most upset about is the way they are accusing the fans,’ she said.

‘They watched videos of what happened
that day and they (have seen) survivors running along with bodies and 
maybe people who may be still alive on hoardings. They were the heroes 
that day.

Disapproving: Sir Kenneth was concerned about Anfield being turned into a 'shrine', according to the papers

‘I find all of that absolutely appalling. Ninety-six lives and he was uneasy about it made into a shrine.

‘The
people who were there that day - the survivors, the fans - all needed 
somewhere to go to show respect and to be grateful that no more had 
died. He was ashamed that was made into a shrine. How appalling is 
that?’

Labour MP Andy Burnham, who has backed efforts to secure the documents’ release, said: ‘These papers seem to confirm what we’ve believed for many, many years – that immediate attempts were made from the highest levels to shift the blame on to the supporters and away from the police.’

Margaret Thatcher was told about the views of Merseyside Police four days after the tragedy

A controversial figure, Sir Kenneth – who died in 1998 – was frequently at loggerheads with the city’s Labour-dominated police authority.

Last night former assistant chief constable Alison Halford, who was in charge of the force’s initial response to the disaster, said she was shocked by his views.

‘There was no suggestion at the time that fans were drunk,’ she said. ‘Sir Kenneth never spoke to me about what had happened and I find his comments absolutely appalling.’

Merseyside Chief Constable Jon Murphy said it would be inappropriate to comment.

Sheila Coleman of the Hillsborough 
Justice Campaign said she was disgusted but not surprised at the views 
expressed by the police.

‘Those
of us who were around Liverpool in the 1980s are well aware of Ken 
Oxford’s racist and bigoted views, Presumably he recruited senior 
officers with a similar mindset,’ she told the programme.

‘We are obviously disgusted with the views of Merseyside Police but to some of us that will come as no surprise.’

She also expressed concern at the timing of the leak and the fact that none of the papers related to the South Yorkshire force.

‘That
makes us very suspicious of how this information was leaked,’ she said.
‘Merseyside Police would have been informed by South Yorkshire Police.

‘We
find it a strange coincidence that this information is leaked only days
after we found out the panel are not going to report until the autumn.’
