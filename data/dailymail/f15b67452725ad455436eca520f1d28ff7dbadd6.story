A suspect in the murder of businessman Neil Heywood struck a bizarre deal to import giant helium balloons to China in a bid to smuggle money into Britain, it was claimed yesterday.

Politician’s wife Gu Kailai asked a  British firm to accept a secret £150,000 over-payment and to use the money to pay her son’s school fees at Harrow, a former company director said.

When the firm refused, the lawyer lost her temper and threatened to have its bosses thrown into jail by her powerful husband if they ever set foot in China.

Mrs Gu, 53, is in custody in China 
where she has been named as a suspect in the murder of Old Harrovian Mr 
Heywood, and she and husband Bo Xilai are at the centre of a corruption
investigation.

Reports in China claim the 41-year-old
British expat was poisoned with cyanide after he threatened to expose 
Mrs Gu for illegally siphoning a vast fortune out the country, while her
husband was a rising star in the ruling Communist Party.

The case has prompted a political 
scandal in China and caused international embarrassment when Britain 
demanded a full investigation into Mr Heywood’s death.

It was reported at the weekend that 
Chinese authorities are expected to release a confession from Mrs Gu in 
an attempt to end the humiliating scandal.

Further evidence of Neil Heywood's strong links with Gu Kailai has emerged, of all places, in an Edwardian mansion block where Princess Diana, right, once lived.

A £1.5million apartment in Coleherne Court, a block of more than 200 properties on the border of Earl's Court and South Kensington in London, is reportedly owned by Mrs Gu.

According to The Sunday Times, neighbours say Harrow-educated Mr Heywood acted as keyholder for the two-bedroom flat on her behalf.

Reports that Mrs Gu had become Mr Heywood's mistress have been denied, but their involvement together at Coleherne Court will fuel speculation about just how far their business dealings went.

It has been alleged that Mrs Gu ordered the murder of Mr Heywood because he was threatening to reveal her overseas dealings, which involved her trying to move large amounts of money out of China through him.

Princess Diana lived at Coleherne Court before marrying Prince Charles.

Company director Giles Hall told how 
Mrs Gu approached his firm, Vistarama, in 1998, when it ran the 
Bournemouth Eye, a tethered balloon which offered views from 500ft above
the seaside town.

Mrs Gu said she was married to Bo 
Xilai, then mayor of Dalian, and she wanted the city to have a similar 
balloon.

As talks progressed she discussed importing hundreds of 
tethered balloons to China.

She was accompanied by Frenchman 
Patrick Devillers, her business partner, and occasionally by Mr Heywood,
a consultant who was mentoring her son, Bo Guagua, to help him get a 
place at Harrow.

Mr Hall said: ‘She was a very cold, hard woman.

'It was 
always apparent that she wanted things to be done quietly and secretly, 
and we had to sign a confidentiality agreement, which seemed bizarre.

‘Patrick said later that we would get 
our fingers burned if we were indiscreet.

'He said it was best just to do
the deal and not to ask too many questions about where the money came 
from.’

The tethered balloon deal for Dalian 
went ahead, but Mr Hall said payments came from a variety of sources, 
including the Dalian Free Trade Zone, private companies and Gu’s account
with Coutts, the Queen’s banker.

A senior US diplomat arrived in China last night on an emergency mission to calm rising tensions between the two superpowers.

Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell landed amid a diplomatic storm between Beijing and Washington after blind  dissident Chen Guangcheng made a dramatic escape to reach the US Embassy and ask for asylum.

Beijing has yet to react to the embarrassing flight of Chen, 40, from putative house arrest last week. Instead, the government has ordered a media blackout and shut down all blogs and internet search engine references to Chen’s escape. 

Chen has made a video addressed to China’s Premier, Wen Jiabao, pleading with him to arrest the officials who beat and tortured him.

He also feared ‘insane retribution’ on his family and supporters, including his mother, wife and young daughter. His escape comes just two months after the senior police chief who exposed Briton Neil Heywood’s murder, Wang Lijun, fled to a US consulate to seek asylum.The Mail understands Mr Campbell’s arrival is part of an attempt to appease the Chinese by offering Chen passage to the US on medical grounds.

He told how Mrs Gu offered to make a 
£150,000 ‘extra payment’ on an air freight charge for a winch they 
needed for the  Dalian balloon.

‘She said, “We have to get Bo Guagua 
into Harrow and we need you to pay the fees”.

'I said we couldn’t afford 
to do that and she said, “No, we pay. We pay the company, you pay the 
school”.’

Mr Hall said his deal with Mrs Gu 
soured when the winch could not be shipped to Dalian and had to go via 
Beijing.

He added: ‘By the end, it was very apparent that there was 
corruption involved. She didn’t have to worry as long as everything went
through Dalian, where her husband was in control.

‘When the winch was sent to Beijing, 
she was furious.

'She said if any of us turned up in China she would get 
us locked up. Plainly she had the means to do it.

'In Dalian they were 
all-powerful.

'Everyone was scared to death of her there.’

It was also reported at the weekend 
that Dr Andrew Jackson, a London coroner, could ask Justice Secretary 
Kenneth Clarke to allow him to hold an inquest into Mr Heywood’s death.

That would pave the way for Scotland Yard to be called in.
