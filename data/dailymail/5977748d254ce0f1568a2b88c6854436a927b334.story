When Sharron Kahn Luttrell first signed up to do her bit for the community by helping to train service dogs, she had little idea what an effect it would have on her life and how it would challenge her preconceptions.

Training Neads puppy Daisy was literally no walk in the park. Instead every weekend, the Massachusetts mother-of-two found herself in the company of her co-trainer Keith - an inmate sent to prison for 40 years when he was 16 - just a few months older than Luttrell's own daughter. 

To her - and his - surprise they developed a deep and lasting friendship as they bonded over Daisy.

Swapping notes and tips in the prison waiting room, Luttrell soon realized this adorable Labrador had the power to change all of their lives.

Her experiences make up the heart-warming memoir Weekends With Daisy, which is currently being developed into a film by CBS Films.

‘Keith had never taken care of anything.
He says he was a selfish kid but you can’t be that way with a puppy,' Luttrell, who has helped train three dogs with him, told MailOnline.

'You have to control your reactions and emotions. When he goes out into 
society he will take those qualities with him.'

It wasn't just Keith who was helped by Daisy. The cute puppy, the color of butterscotch, also taught Luttrell important lessons about patience, perseverance and the ability to judge a person based on their current actions rather than their past.

It was a chance encounter with a service dog at a grocery store that first let to the unlikely alliance between Luttrell and Keith. There she had met another Neads trainer who told her about the program and it seemed the perfect solution to her growing 'empty nest' anxiety.

When she first heard of the National Education for Assistance Dog Services program Luttrell had been at a 
crossroads in her life, with her two children fast growing up and 
needing her less leaving her feeling 'isolated and lost'.

The 
Neads program, which uses inmates to intensively train service dogs, 
gave Luttrell the new focus she was looking for.

Dedication: Keith worked hard teaching Daisy commands and tricks, such as 'say your prayers'

Work out: Inmates train with their puppies in the prison yard

When she first met Keith at a medium security facility in Rhode Island, Luttrell thought her only challenge would be solving those early puppy problems common to anyone with a young dog. 

Luttrell found herself turning to Keith for advice, but she had no idea what he had done to be behind bars.

At first the obvious elephant in the room was not addressed and the Neads program limits interaction between inmates and weekend puppy raisers.

But curiosity got the better of Luttrell - she was a former reporter, after all.

She learned his last name and gasped when she read court documents laying out in clinical detail the shocking nature of his brutal crime. A crime described by the judge as an ‘exhibition of human savagery at its worst’.

Keith had been sentenced to a 40-year sentence for accessory to murder when he was 16, after beating a man, who was then shot dead by his friend.

‘Keith was no longer a generic, gentle inmate who trained puppies … he was someone capable of taking another’s life without a thought,’ she said.

However, their shared goal of helping Daisy and the person who would one day rely on the dog helped Luttrell overcome her feelings of terror and disgust at Keith's crime. 

'For Daisy's sake, for Keith's, for 
mine, and for the person out there who would eventually rely on Daisy, I
had to drop the ugliness of Keith's past', she said.

She added: ‘[Keith’s] grown tremendously. There’s no good outlet to grow in prison. The puppy program is
something meaningful in that place. It gave him confidence.’

The puppy program helps inmates as much as the disabled people who eventually become paired up with the dogs. 

Luttrell said that another inmate she trains with told her that before joining the program everyone told him he was ‘a piece of s***’ and he felt that way too ‘but now he has a different definition’.

Despite her bond with Keith, Luttrell says finding out the background to her inmate co-trainers still remains difficult. 

Her emotions were tested again when, by chance, she discovered the new inmate she was working with had been Keith’s co-defendant – the man who had pulled the trigger on that fateful night. 

‘My blood went cold,’ she said, as she recalled how a prison guard had read out his full name, which identified him.

Knowing the co-trainers have committed horrendous crimes is something the mother struggles with. She said the only way she copes with it is by focusing on how Keith and his co-defendant had been teenagers at the time.

Neads - the National Education for Assistance Dog Services - is a training progam that teaches puppies to become service dogs.

Neads uses a variety of breeds, from Labradors and poodles to collies and labradoodles.

The dogs are trained by inmates, who then hand their puppies to volunteer trainers at weekends so they can get used to the noises, sights and sounds of the outside world.

Training begins when the puppies are eight weeks old, and takes about 18 months to complete.

It costs $25,000 to fully train and pair one of the service dogs with the individual they are matched to.

The training is vigorous but Neads has a long waiting list of people willing to adopt the dogs that don't graduate.

‘They’re so foolish [at that age]’ she said. ‘So impulsive, not operating at full capacity. But that said, you just don’t go around killing people.’

Captain Lefebvre, who helps oversee the prison program, has also witnessed the change in inmates involved in the training. 

He told Luttrell the ‘best trainers are those who consider their work a chance to redeem themselves’. ‘They know they can’t make up for the damage they did … but they can chip away at it.’

For Luttrell, who has now helped train seven puppies, the Neads progam opened the door to a new experience and, as an added bonus, her family gets to have a puppy on weekends.

‘We’re not looking for a dog,’ Luttrell said. ‘I don’t want to go through the end-of-life part again. It’s still too raw [after losing Tucker]’

She said three of the seven dogs she has worked with have 'flunked' the program but her current charge – Rescue – is with her for only one more weekend before graduating. 

Despite being in the program since 2008 the goodbyes never get easier.  ‘That final weekend I spend lots of time on the floor, snuggling,’ she said.

Luttrell always makes a photo album of her time with the dog to pass on to its new owner, who could be disabled, or need a balance dog, and also shares pictures with the inmate who helped co-train the dog.

Daisy not only helped Luttrell focus and learn how to diffuse tensions with her teenage children, the adorable yellow Labrador also helped her see how dogs can transform the lives of the inmates who train them and the people they go on to serve. 

For Luttrell, she has found fulfillment and a new community and, while she admits she still feels frivolous walking into prison each weekend to pick up a puppy, the Neads program gives her a purpose and a way to reach out and help others.
