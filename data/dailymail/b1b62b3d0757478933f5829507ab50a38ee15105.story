Two young sisters died after a car driven by their father’s new partner veered off a road during a trip to the cinema.

Jessica Portor, seven, and Tamzin, ten, were visiting their father Allan over the Christmas break when the Ford Focus crashed into a ditch before rolling into a wooden gate.

Both girls suffered severe head injuries and were pronounced dead at hospital.

Tragedy: The car the sisters were travelling in left the A47 near Wisbech, Norfolk yesterday evening. It went over the wrong side of the road and into a ditch before flipping on its side and hitting a gate

Police are investigating how the car 
lost control in light rain on the 60mph road at Walsoken in Norfolk on 
the border with Cambridgeshire.

There is no evidence that it was  
speeding or that another car was involved in the tragedy near Wisbech on
Thursday evening. Mr Portor, 38, his son Liam, 12, and 43-year-old 
partner Marie Easter all escaped with minor injuries and were kept in 
hospital overnight.

Mr Portor is understood to have recently moved into Miss Easter’s home in Terrington St Clement, near King’s Lynn, Norfolk.

A man who answered her door yesterday said: ‘The police have told them not to speak to anybody, I am afraid.

‘My sister is in a hell of a state. 
This time yesterday those poor girls were running about and looking 
forward to going to the cinema in Peterborough.

‘Marie and Allan are out of hospital and they are very sore. The little boy is fine. You can just imagine how they are.’

Scene: Chief Inspector Chris Spinks at the scene of the fatal crash on A47 near Wisbech, Norfolk. The car hit this gate and the two sisters died from serious head injuries.

Jessica and Tamzin lived with their 
mother Lorraine Mason, 31, in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, and are 
believed to have acted as bridesmaids at her wedding to husband Daniel 
earlier this year.

Mrs Mason, who split from Mr Portor 
around seven years ago, was too upset to talk about the loss last night 
at her semi-detached home.

A friend, who asked not to be named, 
said: ‘This is just an awful tragedy. She was devoted to her girls and 
is absolutely devastated.’

A sign had been hung outside the 
Riverside Pub where Mrs Mason works yesterday. It said: ‘We are sorry 
but due to tragic circumstances there will be no meals today.’

Police are appealing for information about the accident at 6.40pm last night on the 60mph road

A 
colleague said: ‘They are a lovely family. This is a really difficult 
and upsetting time for them.’

Five ambulances raced to the crash 
scene on the A47 shortly before 7pm on Thursday and the road remained 
closed in both directions for almost four hours.

Paramedics fought to save the sisters but they were declared dead at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn..

Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, head of 
road policing in Norfolk and Suffolk, said: ‘Fatal collisions are 
tragic in any circumstances  but given the fact that two young lives 
have been lost at this time of year seems to make it that much worse

‘Specially trained family liaison 
officers are supporting the bereaved relatives and collision 
investigation officers are piecing together the events that led to the 
crash.

'The circumstances are still unclear at this stage and I would ask
anyone who thinks they might have information, no matter how 
insignificant it may seem, to come forward.’

An East of England Ambulance Service 
Trust spokesman said: ‘Crews worked very hard in very difficult 
circumstances but  despite sterling efforts they were sadly unable to 
save the two children.’

The crash happened less than 40 miles 
from another double fatal accident on Christmas Eve on the A47 at 
Dereham, Norfolk.

A couple in their 70s, who have not been named, were 
killed when their car collided with a vehicle travelling in the opposite
direction.

Brothers Adnan Habib, ten, and 
Arsalaan, four, were killed in a Christmas Day tragedy when the car they
were in crashed on the M6 near Stoke-on-Trent. Their aunt, Bushra 
Tazarib, 32, also died.

The family, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, were on their way to a wedding in Bolton.
