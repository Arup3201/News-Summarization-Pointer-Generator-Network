In the second season of TLC's Secret Princes, four nobles from different European countries travel undercover to Austin, Texas, on a mission to find true love.

The series, which debuts on Friday October 25, follows the adventures of two princes, one lord and one heir to a barony as they attempt to woo ladies without the crutch of their titles of nobility.

Not only will they hide their royal connections, but they will also take on minimum wage jobs and attempt to live like an average American, before revealing their true selves at the end of the season.

Undercover: In the second season of TLC's Secret Princes, four nobles from different European countries travel undercover to Austin, Texas, on a mission to find true love

Quest for love: The series, which debuts on Friday October 25, follows the adventures the nobles as they attempt to woo ladies without the crutch of their titles

One of the stars of the show is Prince Alexander of Russia, the 35-year-old son of Princess Olga Andreevna Romanov,  whose father, Prince Andrei Alexandrovich, was the nephew of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar.

Known to most as Francis Mathew, Prince Alexander has apparently been unlucky in love for quite some time; his most recent claim to fame was starring in Ukraine's version of The Bachelor in 2012.

Italian Prince Lorenzo de' Medici is a 37-year-old heir to the Medici dynasty with a passion for cooking and a desire to go into politics.

Lord James Rennell of Rod, 35, is an 
athletic publicity expert with a penchant for partying, and the 
Honourable Oliver Plunkett of Dunsany in Ireland is the 28-year-old 
owner of his own computer game company.

A trailer for the series shows the four men as they are introduced to Austin and start their new jobs - with one of them trying his hand at working in a sandwich food truck.

In another scene, they dress up 'as American as possible' in backwards caps and Hawaiian shirts for a trip to a local bar.

While some of them have luck with the ladies, others find it difficult to conceal their true identities.

Dramatic: At the end when they reveal their identities at a grand ball, the royals may face rejection after the ladies find out they've been lied to, or they may find a fairytale ending

In one scene Oliver chats to a woman at a bar, who asks what he does back in Ireland. 'Just do random stuff really,' he answers suspiciously.

The season will culminate with a grand ball at the end, where the nobles will disclose their true selves in the hope that their newfound loves will still accept them.

'The royals may face their first-ever rejection after the ladies find out they've been lied to,’ says the release. 'Or they may just find the fairytale ending they were searching for all along.'
