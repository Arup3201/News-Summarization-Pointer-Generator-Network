Dishoom, which was founded in 2010 by Shamil and Kavi Thakrar, and Amar and Adarsh Radia, has pleased London diners with its modern Indian dishes with a twist. 

Alongside traditional meals like aromatic briyanis and brunch dish Kejriwal - two fried eggs on chilli cheese toast - is its signature a bacon naan roll; a freshly baked naan with  chilli tomato jam and fresh herbs, and smoked streaky bacon from The Ginger Pig. 

Founder Mr Thakrar said: 'We couldn't be more delighted to hear this news.

'We feel privileged just to be able to serve the guests who come through our doors for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and perhaps share a little bit of our love for Bombay food and culture with them.

'We're truly blown away that so many people have chosen to share their opinions of us online to help us reach the top spot.' 

While Dinner by Heston made it to the top three, other restaurants helmed by celebrity chefs didn't fare so well. 

Gordon Ramsey's eponymous London eaterie in London came in 12th whilst L Atelier De Joël Robuchon placed at 19.

'Must do in London! If you like tapas and you are in London this place is a must. Exactly what it says contemporary tapas. If you are any type of foodie make room for this venture,' diner Kevin L wrote about fifth-placed Barrafina.'

There are 29 establishments outside London  which appear on the list, compiled from 'hundreds of thousands' of Yelp reviews.

The first is Hula Juice Bar and Gallery, Edinburgh at number six.

Yelp, the online urban city guide and app, has compiled, using its own review and star-rating data, a list of the Top 100 places to eat in the UK. 

Elliot Adams, Senior European Communications Manager, said: 'Whilst it is to be somewhat expected that Michelin-starred restaurants with famous chefs have made this year's list of best places to eat in the UK, I am delighted that the Yelp community is able to champion the lesser known gems that serve fantastic food that is accessible to everyone.

'Our list of top eateries, compiled from tens of thousands of Yelp reviews written in 2014, highlights the varied dining experiences open to the UK public with varying budgets and tastes' 

To determine  top places to eat for 2015, the guide's data science team analysed which places were the most popular and well reviewed over the course of 2014. Businesses were compared on a nationwide basis.

Engineers  used a technique based on the Wilson Score to compile a list of highly rated places to eat. This method takes into account both star rating and number of reviews to reveal which spots not only have top notch ratings, but also which are most popular in the Yelp community.

Dishoom's breakfast dish Kejriwal

The dish is named 'the Kejriwal' after the member who used to come in 30 years ago and order cheese on toast with spring onions, chillies and two fried eggs. In Hindu vegetarian households, eggs are off limits, so this would have been a real indulgence. 

The yolks must be runny so that when you cut into them they ooze all over the toast. It might not sound like much, but give it a go – it'll become your weekend brunch favourite. Recipe serves one. 

Ingredients: Two slices white bloomer bread; 100g mature Cheddar, grated, two spring onions, chopped; one green chilli, cut in half lengthways then finely chopped; Cracked black pepper; one tablespoon oil; two free range eggs

Method: Toast the bloomer slices until lightly browned. Mix the cheese, the onions, the chopped green chilli and cracked black pepper in a bowl. Put 2 tbsp of the mixture to one side, then mash the remaining mixture with the back of a spoon. Spread the mashed cheese mixture evenly on the toasted bread. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Place the cheese-on-toast under the grill to cook. Crack the eggs into the frying pan and fry until the whites are set and the yolks are golden and runny Remove the cheese-on-toast from under the grill when it is slightly browned and bubbling on top. Slide the eggs on top of the cheese-on-toast, then sprinkle on the cheese mixture that you put aside earlier, grind a little more black pepper, and grill for a further minute. Serve immediately, with tomato ketchup on the side.
