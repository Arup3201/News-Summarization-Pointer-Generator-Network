The British teenage sisters who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, have posted pictures of 'self defence training' on social media.

Zahra and Salma Halane, both 17, of Chorlton, Manchester left their homes last June after becoming radicalised online.

The pictures have been posted on one of the twins' Twitter accounts, and shows four veiled women holding AK-47 assault rifles and handguns.

In training: One of the Halane twins tweeted this picture, captioned: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters'

Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, and joined ISIS in Syria in June last year after becoming radicalised online

Another image shows two women, their faces, bodies and hands covered, making a 'heart sign', and a third is a picture of the shoes of four women.

The set was captioned: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State... Alhamdulilah [thanks be to God] with humble sisters'.

Although neither Zahra or Salma can be identified in the images due to their full veils, the set was posted on one of their Twitter accounts. 

The Halane twins, whose parents hail from Somalia, are thought to have married two ISIS militants in Syria, who have both died in battle.

They are believed to be part of an all-female religious police brigade alongside former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, who enforce Sharia law on the streets of Raqqa..

This picture, believed to be of Zahra and Salma Halane, was also posted on the Twitter account

Another image showed four sets of shoes, presumably the four women showed in the 'self defence practice'

This image showing outdoor shooting practice in the Islamic State was tweeted by one of the girls

Their parents Ibrahim, 52, and Khadra Jama, 45, travelled to the region in November last year, but the twins are said to have refused to come home.

Previous tweets from Zahra included messages such as ‘I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It’s self defence’ and pictures of machine guns alongside the Koran.

The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. 

Ibrahim and Khadra have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia.

A senior member of the Somali community in Manchester said  they were ‘appalled’ at the sisters' actions.

‘Everyone is really shocked the twins are still in Syria with these so-called jihadi fighters who are carrying out such atrocities,’ he said.

'We, as a Somali people, are all appalled by their actions but we are also desperately sad for their family.
