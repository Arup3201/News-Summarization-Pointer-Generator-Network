British military advice was given to the Indian authorities ahead of the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, William Hague admitted yesterday.

A Special Air Service (SAS) officer flew to the country and advised India's military leaders ahead of the assault in Amritsar.

But a Government investigation into British involvement in the incident concluded the advice had a 'limited impact' on the operation.

It found the officer's advice was largely ignored and Indira Gandhi’s government instead launched a frontal assault – codenamed Operation Blue Star -  which killed 575 and resulted in up to 3,000 deaths from subsequent riots.

The investigation was ordered by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood after documents released under the 30-year rule suggested that an SAS officer advised the Indians about how to deal with the Sikh dissidents occupying the site.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons that a British adviser travelled to India in February 1984, but his recommendation for a surprise assault using helicopters was not reflected in the raid which took place in June that year and resulted in extensive bloodshed.

Mr Hague said: 'The Cabinet Secretary's report finds that the nature of the UK's assistance was purely advisory, limited and and provided to the Indian government at an early stage; that it had limited impact on the tragic events that unfolded at the temple three months later; that there was no link between the provision of this advice and defence sales and there is no record of the (British) government receiving advance notice of the operation.'

Alliance: David Cameron visited the temple last year, and Sikhs in Britain form a key bloc vote for the Tories

He told MPs the SAS assessment ‘made 
clear that a military operation should only be put into effect as a last
 resort’ and recommended that any military operation use ‘an element of 
surprise and the use of helicopter-borne forces in the interest of 
reducing casualties and bringing about a swift resolution’.

David Cameron last night pleaded with the Sikh community to forgive the Tories as it emerged Margaret Thatcher had agreed to send the special forces officer to help the Indians.

Her principal private secretary at the time, Lord Butler of Brockwell, said it was clear the then-prime minister had considered sending the SAS officer 'very carefully' before agreeing to it.

Anger: Lord Indarjit Singh said Mr Hague's statement was 'smug and condescending'

Mr Cameron yesterday said he wanted the dialogue between the Government and the Sikh community over the issue to continue, adding: ‘British Sikhs have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life.

'Thirty years ago, a great tragedy unfolded...in Amritsar. Many lives were lost and the scars in the Sikh community still run deep.

‘I tasked the Cabinet Secretary with getting to the truth. He did so, and there are two main findings.

‘One: around four months before the events, at the request of the Indian Government, a single UK military officer provided some advice. But critically, this advice was not followed, and it was a one-off.

‘Two: there is absolutely no evidence of UK Government involvement in the operation itself.’

The Prime Minister travelled to Amritsar last year to visit the temple - a trip that appeared to have led to a rise in Conservative support among British Sikhs, who are a key voting bloc in marginal constituencies in London and the Midlands.

His efforts are seen by many to have been dashed by the new revelations.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said 'serious questions' remained, adding: ‘The pain and suffering still felt by many about the tragic events of 1984 places a particular duty on the Government to provide what answers it can to address very genuine concerns.’

Dabinderjit Singh, of the Sikh Federation UK, said Britain’s involvement was clear, adding: ‘We are actually very disappointed with the announcement.’

The assault triggered the assassination 
of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (pictured right with Thatcher on a visit to India), who ordered the attack, when two
 Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later

Lord Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, called Mr Hague’s statement ‘smug and condescending’ and said the language in the documents was ‘insulting’ to Sikhs since it suggested they were all extremists.

On the claim that UK advice had a ‘limited impact’ of the Golden Temple attack, Lord Singh said: ‘It is like saying that I had only a minimal involvement in a massacre or a holocaust.’

Jasvir Singh, director of the City Sikhs Network, which represents Sikh professionals in the UK, said the information disclosed in the review ‘harks back to colonial times’.

He added: ‘I think there are lots of people in the Sikh community who are upset that the British could be involved in this, even to a limited extent.’
