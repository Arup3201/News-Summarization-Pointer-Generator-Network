A top civil rights lawyer has  been accused of raping a woman at his Manhattan home after Rev Al Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party.

Sanford Rubenstein, 70, a high-powered attorney in New York, is said to have sexually assaulted the victim at his luxury apartment after the event at the four-star Four Seasons restaurant earlier this week, according to the New York Daily News.

Sources told the paper the rape of the woman, who is believed to be a 42-year-old executive with links to Sharpton, is being investigated as third degree.

Allegations: Sanford Rubenstein, 70, a high-powered attorney in New York, is said to have sexually assaulted the victim at his luxury apartment after Rev Al Sharpton's (right) 60th birthday party 

The charge is brought when the victim is 'incapable of consent', which means she could have passed out or was very drunk at the time.

However Rubenstein, who has appeared as a legal analyst on CNN and MSNB, is yet to have been charged in connection with the encounter.

The NYPD would not comment on the case while Rubenstein's law firm are yet to provide a statement on the story.

The civil rights organisation National Action Network released the following statement: 'National Action Network and Rel Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities. 

'The allegations as reported occured at a private residence after a NAN even and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.' 

The likes of Mayor de Blasio, Gov. Cuomo, director Spike Lee and legendary singer Aretha Franklin were at Sharpton's soiree on Wednesday night. 

Rubenstein is well-known in New York and has been involved in a number of high profile cases.

Recently he was chosen as the attorney for Sandra Amezquita, a heavily-pregnant woman who claims NYPD officers threw her to the ground belly-first during an arrest. 

Spotlight: The civil rights lawyer (right) has represented claimants in a number of high-profile cases. Here he is with Esaw Garner, the wife of Eric who died in a 'chokehold' by an NYPD officer on Staten Island in July  

He is also representing the family of Eric Garner, who died after police officer held him down in what appeared to be a chokehold during an arrest on Staten Island in July. 

His wife Esaw attended Sharpton's bash. He has said his death should help try to improve police policies and practices. 

According to a profile on the website of his law firm Rubenstein Rynecki: 'The senior partner... is one of New York's most sought-after advocates for victims' rights in personal injury and civil rights matters

'Appearing frequently on national and local TV News, he has been quoted in all of New York’s daily newpapers. Rubenstein has been a guest advocating victims rights on Good Morning America, Larry King Live, Geraldo at Large, Inside Edition and Montel.' 

He represented police-torture victim Abner Louima in his civil suit against the city. The case was settled in July 2001 for a stunning $7.1 million, the largest police brutality payout in city history at the time.

In 2010, he published a memoir self-titled Outrageous Rubenstein.
