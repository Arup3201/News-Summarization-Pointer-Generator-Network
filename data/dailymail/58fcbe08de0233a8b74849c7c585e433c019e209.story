A wealthy New York City socialite non-too-pleased with the prospect of living next door to France's top diplomat to the U.S. has thrown a wrench in the country's $7.8 million attempt to buy an official residence in her Manhattan co-op building.

Not on her watch: New York City socialite Elizabeth Kabler upended the sale of a long languishing apartment in her co-op because she didn't like the idea of a French ambassador moving in

Ambassador François Delattre and the French government will have to continue their search for stateside digs now that Elizabeth Kabler, resident of famous East Side co-op tower dubbed River House, has gotten her way.

Fearful of too many guests, constant entertaining and of a neighbor who fancies himself above the law, Kabler penned waged a biter campaign to urge her fellow stakeholders to block the sale of the 14-room co-op to French , or any foreign emissaries.

The Wall 
Street Journal obtained a letter Kabler wrote to her neighbors in June 
after France first made their bid for the place in May.

'It
 is not in the interests of the residents of River House to cohabit with
 foreign emissaries who are, to a large extent, beyond the reach of the 
law,' Kabler wrote.

Built
 in 1931, River House offers sweeping views on the East River just a 
couple of blocks from United Nations Plaza. Considered one of New York's
 finest apartment buildings, it would have been a choice spot for 
Delattre and for subsequent ambassadors.

'[The
 ] 5 Bedroom, 5.5 Bathroom, duplex offers the grace and flow of a bygone
 era with oversized rooms, 10'6" ceilings, fine proportions and large 
windows,' reads the official Sotheby's listing.

The home boasts a library and formal dining room, three maid's bedrooms and a maid's bath, according the listing.

While
 the French agreed to limits on the number of armed guards in the 
building and to limits on sovereign immunity, Kabler's efforts would 
ultimately doom the purchase.

After
 the socialite's campaign, the board placed tight restrictions on the 
number of parties the Ambassador would be allowed and on the number of 
guests allowed at each.

The good life: The famous Art Deco River House is one of New York City's finest buildings, but some say its intimidating co-op board has tarnished its appeal

Still looking: France's Ambassador to the US François Delattre wanted to make the 14-room East Side duplex the permanent home of the French ambassador, but his parties, armed guards and diplomatic immunity soured the deal for residents of River House

Perhaps
 it was Kabler's family ties to diplomacy--her philanthropist mother 
Leonore Annenberg held the rank of ambassador as chief of protocol under
 President Ronald Reagan and her stepfather Walter Annenberg was a U.S. 
ambassador to the U.K.--that fed her fears, but they came at an 
inopportune time for the building.

The
 apartment, while among the choicest in the city, has been on the market
 for years and seen its asking price cut several times.

Perhaps
 it was for that reason that the broker who handled the almost-sale now 
maintain there was absolutely 'no backlash' following the diplomat's 
offer.

'This
 is not an increasing trend,' Sotheby's broker Pat Wheatley told 
Expatica. '[He] is a wonderful potential resident and I am sure he will 
find an appropriate residence that he will be happy living in.'
