Living beneath a roof that weighs more than the average cruise ship may make some people a little nervous. 

But it is commonplace for the residents in the Portuguese village of Monsanto, who adapted their homes around the environment filled with gigantic granite boulders.

In the mountaintop village, homes are sandwiched between, under and even in the 200-tonne rocks.

'I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder': Villagers in Monsanto, Portugal have made their homes around ancient boulders

Watch your head! The boulders, weighing up to 200-tonnes, have been utilised for walls, floors and even ceilings (pictured)

The enormous boulders have been utilised as walls, floors, and most astoundingly, as roofs for houses that date back to the 16th century.

In 1938, Monsanto was named 'the most Portuguese village in Portugal', though its jaw-dropping land forms make it anything but regular.

Located in the municipality of Idanha-a-Nova, in eastern Portugal near the Spanish border, Monsanto sits at 2,486 feet above sea level and has spectacular views.

Donkey is the preferred form of transport for Monsanto's 800 residents, who have managed to maintain the village's medieval character.
