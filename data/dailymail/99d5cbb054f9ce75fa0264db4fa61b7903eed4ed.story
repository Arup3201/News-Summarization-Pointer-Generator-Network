When you feel blue, or something goes wrong, what do you do? Most would say put on a brave face or looking on the bright side is best. After all, what’s the point in crying over spilt milk?

But a revolutionary new book says such a stiff upper lip could do you far more harm than good.  

In Constructive Wallowing, renowned U.S. psychologist Tina Gilbertson makes the extraordinary claim that dwelling on our bad feelings is, in fact, the key to health and happiness.

All by myself: Even film character Bridget Jones (pictured) recognised the importance of a good wallow to recuperate after a heart-ache

Gilbertson discovered this method after seeking therapy for her own depression, and realising she had always held in negative feelings as her parents had discouraged her from crying as a child.

It was only in accepting them, and allowing herself to feel her sadness and pain fully, that they finally started to dissipate and she began to recover.

When she became a therapist, she started to encourage her clients to try such ‘constructive wallowing’ themselves, and noted how beneficial it was.

Dr Jay Watts, a London-based consultant clinical psychologist, believes her method is convincing. She says: ‘We Brits have a reputation for holding our emotions in.

‘As well as a fear of judgment — such as being seen as a “hysterical woman” — strong emotions can feel scary. But if we don’t deal with them they will only rear their heads again, potentially leading to deep-seated psychological problems.’

Of course, there’s a difference between self-destructive moping — comfort eating, drowning your sorrows in alcohol or lashing out — and constructive wallowing.

Indeed, Gilbertson says her step-by-step guide to wallowing constructively, without shame, could help you avoid this kind of destructive behaviour altogether.

It could even be the key to happier relationships, more energy, greater confidence and even good health, as it can reduce the kind of chronic stress that leads to high blood pressure, a lowered immune system and loss of libido.

Here, in this exclusive adaptation, we show how constructive wallowing can help you safely beat bad feelings by allowing yourself to have them in the first place — leaving you happier than ever.

This quick quiz will give you a sense of your relationship with your emotions — and how those feelings are influencing your life. Give yourself a point for every statement you agree with, and half a point where you find yourself on the fence.

Once you’ve done it, cut it out and keep it so once you’ve tried constructive wallowing for a week or two, you can take the quiz again to see how your outlook has changed . . .

How to wallow: Try to set aside at least an hour and find a private place such as a bedroom or a bath. Avoid alcohol, food and other distractions such as the radio or your phone

SCORE OF 0-4: You already have a great deal of self-compassion and allow yourself to wallow when you need to.

SCORE OF 5-9: You have some positive feelings about yourself but could enjoy the extra energy that constructive wallowing will bring. 

SCORE OF 10-14: You’re too self-critical. Learning how and when to wallow will boost your self-esteem and improve your relationships.

SCORE OF 15+: You’re probably exhausted from trying not to let your emotions show. Wallowing could be life-changing for you.

Wallowing is like brushing your teeth; it’s a great thing to do, but not at a cocktail party.

Try to find a chunk of time between all your obligations, but remember if you’re feeling stuck or emotional, the only constructive use of your time is to pay attention to your emotions, as they won’t let you go until you do.

Try to set aside at least an hour and find a private place such as a bedroom or a bath. Avoid alcohol, food and other distractions such as the radio or your phone.

Spend as long as you need and take tissues with you. But a little bit of wallowing, even five minutes, is better than never wallowing at all: you can even do it while queuing, stuck in traffic or hoovering.

Constructive wallowing is a formal five-step process Gilbertson has christened the TRUTH technique. It’s not a one-time fix, but a blueprint for a new way of living that you must constantly practice. Before you begin, take at least ten breaths and let your body relax. Go through each step as slowly as you need to, and stop when it feels natural — it could take a minute or an hour. Let your emotions spill out and feel each one fully.

Tell yourself the situation. For example, if a friend has let you down or you’re upset about what someone has said to you.Realise
 what you’re feeling. Try to put words to what you’re experiencing, for 
example: ‘I feel humiliated,’ or: ‘I’m dreading my sister’s wedding.’Uncover
 self-criticism. Often negative feelings like envy, dislike or 
disappointment make you feel like you’re an envious, hateful, weak 
person — but you’re not. Good people feel angry, jealous and impatient, 
too.  So root out impatience with yourself and don’t think you’re too 
sensitive. You’re allowed to feel how you feel. Try
 to understand yourself. Look for reasons why a good person would feel 
this way. It’s OK to want that promotion over someone else, even if they
 did deserve it. Have the feeling. Just sit with it, cry about it, talk to yourself about it, hug or punch  a pillow — whatever you need  to do.

Many people worry that if they allow themselves to fully experience their negative feelings, they might fall into a metaphorical black hole and never get out. Others think it’s a sign of weakness to mope and, of course, it can be painful to cry.

But when we ignore feelings, they get stuck inside us and multiply. This, Gilbertson explains, is known as the ‘escalation cycle’, and it goes like this: when you have a bad feeling — anything from losing a friend to getting angry over a late train — you may suppress it because it seems inconvenient, too painful or too big.

Do despair: Many people worry that if they allow themselves to fully experience their negative feelings, they might fall into a metaphorical black hole and never get out

Instead, you might turn to food, alcohol, shopping, sex or another activity that blanks out your true emotional state with temporary good feelings. Or you might have trained yourself to ignore unpleasant feelings altogether.

Either way, feelings get stuffed inside, festering and piling up until one of two things happens.

Either they eventually explode in a form of destructive behaviour (just think of how you can erupt into a temper over something seemingly minor after a day full of niggles), which gives some brief relief, but may well leave you feeling full of remorse.

Or, they are buried even deeper, which can eventually lead to chronic emotional and even physical pain, leading to breakdowns, anxiety or stress.

Constructive wallowing stops this cycle. It’s much healthier to acknowledge each bad feeling so you can deal with it, get over it and move on. It sounds strange, encouraging you to do something which feels bad to make you feel better.

But according to Gilbertson, mentally crying ‘Ouch!’ when life hurts you will make you feel more peaceful and less anxious.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, wallowing over something that happened months or years ago is good if it’s bothering you now. While nothing can change the past, it doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to have feelings about it.

You’re not hanging on to the bad things — it’s the other way round: your feelings still have hold of you.

In order to help those memories disappear, you have to deal with them properly.

Remember, feelings are not values. If you feel indignant about something, it’s not because you’re an indignant person — you’re just indignant about a particular thing.

Tackle your hang-ups: Contrary to conventional wisdom, wallowing over something that happened months or years ago is good if it's bothering you now

Don’t make a moral judgment out of having an unpleasant feeling. Only judge yourself by your actions. We often forget that having an emotion is not the same as acting on it: feeling angry is not the same as swearing.

We can feel one way and act another. This means we shouldn’t keep a stranglehold on negative emotions. Allowing yourself to experience them without judgment is at the centre of constructive wallowing and, says Gilbertson, one of the most liberating things you can do.

Wallowing does not mean holding on to anger. Forgiveness and moving on comes naturally after a period of constructive wallowing, when you have allowed yourself to experience bad feelings, and then let them go.

It’s not necessary to make  yourself feel forgiveness towards someone who’s hurt you, it happens naturally. In the same way, if you’re worried about opening the floodgates of your emotions and not being able to stop crying once you’ve started, trust that wallowing has a natural end.

Just make sure you give yourself enough time when you sit down to do it. You’ll be amazed by the difference it will make to your life.
