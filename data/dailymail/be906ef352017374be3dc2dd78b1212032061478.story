Mail on Sunday journalists triumphed at the Press Awards last  week, scooping major prizes and a  series of commendations.

Political Editor Simon Walters is the Political Journalist of the Year for the third time while Craig Brown is the Critic of the Year for the fourth time.

Highly commended were David Rose (feature writer), Robert Verkaik (specialist writer) and Mark Pain (sports photographer).

The judges described Walters as ‘one of the best story-getters in the business. His authoritative and forensic coverage of Leveson was an example of top-quality political writing’.

Walters’s stories included the revelation that Lord Leveson had ‘threatened to quit’ over criticism from a Cabinet Minister, sensational text messages between David Cameron and former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, and the accurate prediction that Cameron would reject Leveson’s call for legislation.

Of our chief books critic Craig Brown, the judges said: ‘His breadth of knowledge, versatility and luminous perception is second only to his biting wit... A beautiful writer who always makes you laugh at the same time as you are impressed by his insight.’

He also won The Best of Humour award for his ‘laugh-out-loud funny’ column in the Daily Mail.

Our website MailOnline won the Digital Award. Presenting it, BBC Breakfast’s Susanna Reid said the site was essential reading and added: ‘Its sidebar of shame is a talking point in its own right!’

The Mail on Sunday also had nominations for Elizabeth Sanderson (interviewer), Barbara Jones  (foreign reporter), and You magazine (supplement of the year).

The awards were organised by The Society of Editors, and its executive director Bob Satchwell said they were ‘a true reflection of the brilliant journalism in UK newspapers’.

He added: ‘The awards, rather than the Leveson Report, provide the real evidence of the culture and practice of the British press.’
