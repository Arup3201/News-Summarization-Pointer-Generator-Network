'No': Sir Paul McCartney (pictured with wife Nancy Shevell) has become one of the most high-profile celebrities to back the 'no' campaign

Sir Paul McCartney has become one of the most high-profile celebrities yet to back the campaign against Scottish independence by demanding: 'Let's stay together.'

The former Beatle – who wrote Mull Of Kintyre in tribute to the remote part of Scotland where he owns a farm – has signed an open letter calling on voters to choose No in next month's referendum.

His intervention, announced at a rally in his home city of Liverpool, came as David Cameron admitted that he was 'emotional and nervous' about the result of the ballot in just 18 days' time.

The letter signed by Sir Paul, along with other public figures including Sir Mick Jagger, Professor Stephen Hawking and Sir Bobby Charlton, declares: 'We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them.'

It adds: 'What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together.' 

TV historian Dan Snow, one of the campaign co-ordinators for Let's Stay Together, said at the event in Liverpool: 'Sir Paul is one of the world's most respected musicians. We are humbled that he has signed the letter.

'Sir Paul's signature, alongside Sir Mick Jagger's and those of tens of thousands of people from all over the country, shows that English, Welsh and Northern Irish people hope passionately that the Scottish vote to renew their bonds of citizenship with us.'

The song Mull Of Kintyre, featuring the local Campbeltown pipe band, was the Christmas No 1 in 1977 and became the first single to sell two million copies in the UK.

Sir Paul bought High Park Farm in 1966 when he was living with actress Jane Asher, before turning it into a family home with his fist wife Linda. 

He has said that he was inspired by the 'wandering single-track roads and sense of solace' of the 600-acre estate to write The Long And Winding Road.

Yesterday Mr Cameron admitted to being worried about the referendum after a poll last week showed that No campaign's lead has been cut in half to just six points.

The poll followed a second televised debate between First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling in which Mr Salmond emerged on top.

The Prime Minister said: 'I'm emotional and nervous because it matters so much.'

But he insisted that there was a 'silent majority' of people who were afraid to admit to their support for the union 'because they worry about retribution from the Scottish government'.

Sir Paul's intervention led to predictable blizzard of song puns. Scottish Labour MP Anne McGuire, a No supporter, said: 'We are glad to have the Help! of Sir Paul McCartney. 

It is hardly surprising that Sir Paul wants us to Come Together. Maybe rather than trying to take us all on a Magical Mystery Tour, Alex Salmond should just Let it Be.'

A spokesman for the pro-independence camp said: 'It's fantastic that Sir Paul loves Scotland, and we're sure he will continue to do so after Scots say, ''Yeah, yeah, yeah''. 

The case for Yes is a democratic one – as far as Scotland is concerned the Westminster system belongs to Yesterday, and independence will be good for the Mull Of Kintyre and all of Scotland. Yes is definitely the best Ticket To Ride.'

Sir Paul's spokesman declined to comment. 

 

WITH just over a couple of weeks to go to an event where a small minority of a nation could well destroy my country without any participation from the majority (some exercise in democracy, that), I just want to address two things that still trouble me.

Firstly, independence from what exactly?

At the last General Election, the Scottish Conservative Party polled 17 per cent of the popular vote and the Scottish Nationalist Party polled 20 per cent – just three points more.

So just as those in the Yes Campaign say they want to be free of rule by the hated Tories of Westminster, what about those Scottish Conservatives and many more non-Tories who cannot abide Alex Salmond's snake oil?

Why should they be enslaved by an ideology that means not just that they will have a government they have to tolerate for the next five years, but that they will become unwilling citizens for ever in a new country they didn't even want to exist?

Is it independence to share the pound but have no influence in the decisions concerning interest rates? 

Is it independence to be punished severely by the markets (with higher debt-service costs) for defaulting on Scotland's share of the deficit?

Digby Jones suggests it's arrogant of Alex Salmond to expect the Queen will carry on acting as a monarch for Scotland as well

Secondly: how will the rest of the UK respond if the tartan turkeys do indeed vote for Christmas on September 18? 

I do hope we will not roll over and give an independent Scotland the fuzzy partnership of allowing them to cherry-pick all the best bits of the old UK (including Her Majesty the Queen – how arrogant of Mr Salmond just to assume she will still be their Queen. Has anyone asked her?). 

We must not take the Nationalistic punch on the chin, letting it be 'business as usual'.

So yes, let's have proper border controls. Given they won't be in the EU from the start (Spain will see to that, given they won't want a rampant Catalonia on their hands), let's make everyone north of the border apply for a visa. 

Until Scotland becomes part of the EU, someone resident in Scotland seeking to come and live in England should be treated just the same as someone resident in India.

No they can't just decide unilaterally to share our currency... they wanted this divorce, not us. 

Mr Salmond is like the husband seeking a divorce against the will of his wife but saying he's keeping all the best bits of the matrimonial home.

We will not build our warships in a foreign country so the Govan and Rosyth shipyards will close, for starters. 

Just explain that to the good men and women who have built our warships there for centuries but will now be looking for the enhanced welfare payments promised by the nationalists.

How will independence pay for those? Increased taxes? Public-spending cuts? 

And most of all, when the oil price is cyclically against them, when the financial services community has left town, when the independent Scots are faced with cutting public services and putting up taxes, when the Scottish at last awake from their Braveheart dream and will take no more, I do so hope that the new, Independent Nation of England, Wales & Northern Ireland will not use my and others' taxes to bail out the new Independent Nation of Scotland. 

No one gave us a say in this matter so it will not be our problem to solve.

Independence is for ever; it isn't something you can change at the next Election if you don't like it.

It isn't something you can call a day on. Every Braveheart voting with his or her heart will be stuck with it. It's about running a country, Mr Salmond, not taking part in a Mel Gibson fiction.
