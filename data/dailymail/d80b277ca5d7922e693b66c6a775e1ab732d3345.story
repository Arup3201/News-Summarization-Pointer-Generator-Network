It was a familiar sight in the Premier League from 2004 to 2007, a long grey coat celebrating up and down the touchline.

But Jose Mourinho has said his famous grey trenchcoat won't be making an appearance at Chelsea this time around.

The Portuguese said he doesn't want to look back to past successes in his new role, but forge ahead and determine the club's future.

Familiar: Jose Mourinho's long trenchcoat was a staple of his first spell at Stamford Bridge

No more: The coat, which spurred chants from opposition fans, is now on display in the Chelsea museum

Then and now: Mourinho, on this summer's pre-season tour, says the coat will not make a comeback

'I don’t have it now, it is in the Chelsea Museum,' he told the club's official magazine.

'I don’t think it’s good to be nostalgic about it, to think about things that happened in the past. I did that a lot with coats and watches I wore during some seasons.

'When it’s over, it’s over and we look forward to a new season and project. So, not the same coat, that’s for sure.'

In keeping with this mindset, 
Mourinho also said his main priority is to develop players at the club, 
while still retaining his famous winning mentality.

'Normally,
people measure success with trophies.

'They’re very closely related, but
I don’t think it is so linear like that – especially in a squad like we
have, which is a squad for the future,' he said.

'We have to work to improve a big percentage of these players who are very young, preparing the future of this club.

'I’m
very, very focused on this, but at the same time always trying to get 
results, even knowing the best time will arrive in a couple of years.'

Blues youngsters like Josh McEachran, Nathaniel Chalobah and Islam Feruz have all featured in pre-season before looking for top-flight loans, while players like Oscar and Eden Hazard are already some of the club's key players.

Both those players scored in Chelsea's first match of the American leg of their pre-season tour against Inter Milan.

The Blues triumphed 2-0 in a match which was overshadowed by a horrific challenge on John Terry, which saw Inter's Hugo Campagnaro see red.

Mourinho's coat was a constant throughout his first spell at Stamford Bridge, prompting opposition fans to taunt him with chants like 'Your coat's from Matalan.'

Mourinho also revealed that coming back to Stamford Bridge was easy because of his love for the club.

'I love the football in this country but, of course, Ialways felt this respect from the fans; even whenI was coaching other clubs, especially last season when I felt – even by not being at Stamford Bridge – many supporters wished me to be back,' he said. 'That was important

'The best thing is that I don’t have to learn how to love my club. When I came for the first time, and to Inter and Madrid, I had to learn, and now it’s the same club I already love. That’s very important.

'When you have big emotional connections with a club you become easily a top professional,somebody who gives everything and cares for the club without a selfish vision of his job.

'To already be a Chelsea fan like I am, and the manager, it gives me a big push to try to be better and better.'
