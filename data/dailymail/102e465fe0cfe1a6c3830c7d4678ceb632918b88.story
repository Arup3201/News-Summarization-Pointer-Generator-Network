Leicester City are ready to make a loan move for Manchester United youngster Nick Powell.

Foxes boss Nigel Pearson is hoping to complete the move for the forward who signed for United in 2012 from Crewe.

Powell, 20, has made just two league appearances and scored one goal since switching to Old Trafford.

Shipped out: Powell played in the defeat to MK Dons but with fewer games this season will be allowed to leave

Good strike: The forward has scored just one Premier League goal in two appearances for United

He spent last season on loan at Wigan in the Championship, but Leicester want to give him a chance in the top flight for the first time. 

Powell could be one of a number of players to leave on deadline day. Tom Cleverley is weighing up a move to Aston Villa and has Valencia as an option while Danny Welbeck could be heading south to join Tottenham Hotspur.

United boss Louis van Gaal is hoping to complete the signing of Daley Blind and has been linked with Monaco striker Radamel Falcao.

Loan star: Last season Powell spent time on loan at Wigan where he scored ten goals in League and cup

Back then: Powell signed for United in 2012 alongside Shinji Kagawa, who also recently left the club
