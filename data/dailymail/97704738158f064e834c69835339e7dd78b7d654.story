Lord Tebbit insisted people ought to know that if they 'stuff themselves silly' they will get fat

Lord Tebbit says fat people have only themselves to blame for their obesity if they insist on ‘stuffing themselves silly’.

The former Tory chairman said people’s ‘stupid actions’ in eating ‘rubbish’ foods all day was behind the rise in obesity.

He was cheered in the House of Lords when he told peers that rather than setting up government initiatives to persuade  people to eat more healthily, ministers should simply tell them that weight is a matter of individual responsibility.

Scientists say that by 2050, half of women, almost two-thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese. But earlier this week the National Obesity Forum said these predictions were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’.

Former employment secretary Lord Tebbit said: ‘People ought to know that if they stuff themselves silly with high-calorie rubbish foods, they will get fat.

‘It’s their responsibility and all the forums and other nonsenses are merely trying to divorce  people from the consequences of their own stupid actions.’

As some peers cheered Lord Tebbit’s comments, Health Minister Earl Howe appeared to agree with him. He said: ‘You are absolutely right to place your finger on this central point – that it is in the end up to individuals themselves to take responsibility for their own state of health.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week called for ‘some real national soul-searching’ about how the UK can ‘grip this problem’.’

The NHS has warned that the statistics 
paint ‘an alarming picture that reveals that the obesity epidemic in 
England shows no signs of abating anytime soon’.

People had to stop eating 'rubbish' and understand the consequences of their 'own stupid actions', Lord Tebbit added

A national obesity forum report yesterday suggested forecasts that half the UK population will be obese by 2050 may ‘underestimate’ the problem.

Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist at Croydon University Hospitals, South London, said obesity was ‘the greatest threat to health worldwide’.

He said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol combined, and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘denial’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products.

Dr Malhotra said the companies were using the same tactics as those used by the tobacco industry 50 years ago when evidence first emerged that smoking caused lung cancer.

‘Junk food companies sponsor sporting events and athletes endorse sugary drinks, with advertising that targets the most vulnerable members of society, including children,’ he said.
