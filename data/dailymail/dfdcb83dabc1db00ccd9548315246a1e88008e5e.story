To the Rotary Club members they befriended, John and Linda Hirst were a respectable couple reaping the rewards of their hard work.

They lived in a £1.5million gated villa in Majorca, drove expensive cars and enjoyed five-star holidays abroad.

The pair even paid £200,000 for a Las Vegas wedding and a sumptuous reception for hundreds of guests.

But the Hirsts’ vast wealth had little
to do with hard work and the Rotary friends and golf chums were nothing
more than hapless victims.

For almost a decade they targeted unsuspecting British expats living in Spain as part of a £10million Ponzi scheme.

They now face swapping their sprawling Spanish retreat for a 10ft by 6ft prison cell after they were finally exposed as cheats.

Hirst, 61, a convicted fraudster who 
was previously jailed over another £500,000 scam, was warned to expect a
lengthy sentence after he pleaded guilty to fraud and money-laundering.

Villa renovation: £270,000

Hotels, holidays, flights: £160,000

Cruises: £75,000

Las Vegas wedding: £90,000

Post-wedding party: £100,000

Jewellery: £25,000

Homes for family: Unknown

His 62-year-old wife, Linda, was 
convicted of two money-laundering charges and one of evading a liability
by deception after a six-week trial at Bradford Crown Court.

Last 
night, as a judge said their crimes were of the ‘utmost gravity’, fresh 
details began to emerge of their extraordinary spending sprees.

They splashed out £270,000 renovating 
their Spanish villa, a further £160,000 on holidays,  £75,000 on a 
series of luxury cruises and £25,000 on jewellery, the court heard.

They
even bought a home for Hirst’s unwitting ex-wife and daughter.

But it was the couple’s own wedding that was the most extravagant purchase of all.

Wedding planner Julie Bussell said she
had been contacted by the couple in 2006 and was asked to throw the 
‘most expensive party ever’.

She set about arranging a £100,000 
weekend-long wedding reception in Majorca after the couple had already 
spent £90,000 tying the knot in Las Vegas.

Guests enjoyed a golf 
competition, a ladies’ pampering session and a barbecue as well as the 
wedding itself.

John Hirst also paid for family 
members to fly in for the celebration before jetting off with his wife 
to the exclusive Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai on the way to the 
Seychelles for their honeymoon.

Mrs Bussell said: ‘They had a really 
fabulous venue in a  five-star hotel. It was a luxury wedding reception 
with everything they wanted.

The wedding planner who organised a £100,000 celebration for convicted Ponzi fraudster John Hirst and his wife Linda said it was the most expensive party she had ever thrown.

The now-estranged couple and their adviser Richard Pollett would rub shoulders with their victims on golf courses and at Rotary Club dinners, all the while siphoning off money.

After the case, wedding planner Julie Bussell, who gave evidence during the trial, told how she arranged the Hirsts' £100,000-pound wedding celebration in Majorca after they had already tied the knot in Las Vegas at a cost of more than £90,000.

The court heard that during the weekend in June 2006 guests enjoyed a golf competition, a ladies' pampering session and a barbecue as well as the wedding party itself.

John Hirst had also paid for some family members to fly in for the celebration.

Speaking from Majorca, she said: 'They had a really fabulous venue in a five-star hotel. It was a really luxury wedding with everything they wanted.

'They paid for their family and friends to stay in the hotel. Linda hired a Rolls-Royce that she wanted to take to the church. There was a golf tournament for the men and spa treatments for the ladies, on the Sunday there was a big barbecue at the hotel with a jazz band.

'I didn't know anything about how John Hirst operated his business, he paid the contractors himself directly. He seemed a charming sort of guy.'’

But while the couple enjoyed all the 
material benefits of their newfound fortune, their victims were 
beginning to count the cost.

Simon Bourne-Arton QC, prosecuting, 
said Hirst and his accountant, Richard Pollett, 70, had defrauded 
investors through the company, Gilher Inc, which was registered in 
Panama and the Seychelles.

Victims were promised high rates of interest in return for capital investment with their money guaranteed.

In reality, the money was going to 
offshore accounts controlled by Hirst, with only small amounts going 
back to investors every month – but enough to persuade them the scheme 
was working.

Of the £10million they handed over between 2001 and 2009 the investors received only £4.6million back.

The scam began to unravel in 2009 when
a series of delayed payments to investors sparked an investigation by 
the Serious Fraud Office.

The case finally ended on Monday when 
Pollett, from Poole, Dorset, was convicted of fraud. Linda Hirst, of 
Woking, Surrey, and her husband, from Brighouse, West Yorkshire, have 
since split up.

The pair will be sentenced on August 31 along with 
Pollett.

Expat Janet Corbin, originally from Manchester, lost 200,000 euros in the swindle.

She said: ‘I’m delighted British justice has prevailed.’

Victim Charles Dewey, 52, lost an 
estimated £200,000 and suffered a nervous breakdown as a result.

He 
said: ‘It is the cruelty of the fact that he preyed on people, the 
majority of whom were retired.’

Hirst’s solicitor son Daniel Hirst, 
36, of Leeds, and step-daughter Zoe Waite, 36, of Send, Surrey, who had 
denied money-laundering charges, were cleared by the jury.
