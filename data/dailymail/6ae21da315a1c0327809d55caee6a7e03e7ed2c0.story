The Asparagus season faces ruin this year after the wettest April on record has led to a national shortage.

Growers usually start cutting the green spears by the end of last month but so far, hardly any have appeared.

Prices of the popular Spring vegetables have rocketed from £6 to £10 per kilo in supermarkets, where it has been flying off the shelves in recent years due to TV cookery programmes.

In demand: The growing popularity of Asparagus is being offset by a shortage after the April showers reduced crop levels

The weather has also lead to the cancellation of this weekend’s traditional British Asparagus Festival in Evesham, Worcestershire, where many growing fields have been flooded this week.

The asparagus season only lasts around seven weeks from May 1 to June 21, and there are fears the whole £20million British crop of around 5,000 tons, could be a write-off if the weather does not improve soon.

Andy Allen, the chairman of the Asparagus Growers’ Association, said the wet weather has resulted in a cold soil when the vegetable needs warm, dry dirt to flourish.

He said: ‘Things are really very 
desperate. We had two very heavy frosts in April followed by an awful 
lot of rain and that has cooled the soil right down.

‘Asparagus
requires warm and dry soil in April in order to grow and it just hasn’t
grown. It is the same picture across the UK. There is virtually nothing
out there.’

500,000 tonnes of Asparagus are grown every year

150 growers in Britain

In 2010, the retail crop was valued at £18.2m

6m tonnes are produced by China each year - more than any other nation

There are also concerns for this month's annual Chelsea Flower Show as the cold and sodden weather may lead to fungal diseases in the ground.

Many designers have had to quickly rethink and redesign previous plans in an attempt to avoid what some are saying may be the dullest displays.

Tim Rumball, editor of Amateur Gardening magazine, said 'The rain has certainly been a relief from the drought but without warmer temperatures and wind the ground becomes waterlogged which encourages fungal diseases.

'If this sort of weather carries on it will be very challenging for designers at Chelsea.

'But many plants are grown undercover and in carefully controlled conditions so they should be fine.'

Mr Rumball also advised householders to aeriate their lawns with forks to bring life into them.

He said: 'The laws are just muddy and people need to get a big fork and jump up and down on it a lot.

'The
drought in the late winter would have slowed growth and weakened roots.
The rain has then drowned the roots and prevented access to air so 
drainage is essential.

'It 
is more than likely that the grass is growing poorly and is not likely 
to get too long but that will not be the case for everyone.'

The Asparagus Festival in Evesham has been cancelled this year because of the downpour

Meanwhile, a major knock-on effect 
near-constant rain has seen the number of people visiting garden centres
to buy plants and products needed.

Some businesses have reported a 25 per cent loss in trade compared to April 2011.

However,
it was not all bad news for garden centres. B&Q reported a 49 per 
cent rise in sales of waterbutts and a 145 per cent increase in demand 
for wellington boots for April.

Martin Stewart, owner of Stewarts Garden Centres based in Christchurch, Dorset, said their profits were down by 25 per cent.

There have also been concerns for the Chelsea Flower Show over the torrential downpour in April

He said: 'Last year's April was a mix of sun and rain but we had the Royal Wedding bank holiday and an early May bank holiday which helped.

'This year people just haven't been gardening because of the weather. It hasn't just been wet is has also remained very cold for this time of year.

'Even the most keenest of gardeners has struggled to get outside for much of April.

'The months of April and May should be one of the busiest times of the year in the garden.

'A lot of seeds and bulbs are planted and people start thinking about bedding plants for their hanging baskets and containers.

'And they generally go to garden centres to buy not only these items but also compost and fertiliser and pots and baskets.

'But if they put these plants in the ground over the last week or so they would probably have drowned.'

A spokesman for the Golden Acres Garden Centre in Bournemouth, added: 'People are just not gardening.

'If they plant anything, heavy rain and hail will just ruin the plants. Being as wet as it has been is causing chaos, people cannot get in the garden.

'They are less inclined to hang baskets. It is too expensive to heat greenhouses and almost impossible to care for seedlings.'
