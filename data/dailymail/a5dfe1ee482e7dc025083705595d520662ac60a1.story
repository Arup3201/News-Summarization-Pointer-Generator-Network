A stampede of Chinese and Russian investors is snapping up British homes aimed at families and first-time buyers.

Houses in South Wales, cottages in Weston-super-Mare, and flats in Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among properties offered at foreign investment fairs and on estate agents’ websites in China and Russia.

Until now, wealthy overseas buyers have largely focused on mansions and exclusive riverside flats in London.

But an investigation by the Mail found investors keen to make a profit from the booming UK property market are purchasing homes across the country.

Some Chinese buyers who can pay in cash are touring northern towns to find investment opportunities. Experts fear this trend will force up prices for ordinary families.

The number of homes bought with cash rose by about a fifth over the past year, according to estate agents Savills, suggesting a surge in wealthy investors.

Paula Higgins, of consumer group the HomeOwners Alliance, said: ‘The money from these buyers should be invested in businesses or the manufacturing industry not in family homes.

‘This pushes up prices out of reach of families. How are first-time buyers supposed to… compete with a foreign investor who can pay for a home up front with cash?’

Britain is in the grip of an intense housing shortage. An estimated 240,000 new homes are needed each year in England, but only around half this figure is being built.

Although price rises are expected to slow next year, the average home costs nearly ten times average earnings at £262,823 – the biggest disparity since the housing boom peak in 2007.

The South East has seen the greatest increases, with prices climbing by 10.9 per cent to an average £263,333 according to Halifax bank.

Prices in the North West and Yorkshire and Humber rose by around 8 per cent, driving the cost of the average home in these areas up to £137,295 and £130,206 respectively.

In London, the top end of the housing market is being propped up by foreign buyers. Previous research revealed as much as 85 per cent of prime property purchases there are being made with foreign money.

Estate agent network London Property Partners said just 15 per cent of its sales in the capital up until June 2013 were made by UK buyers.

But property experts say that because prices have soared by 19 per cent in 18 months in London, many overseas investors are targeting homes further afield where prices are cheaper.

Angliadom, a property firm in Russia, encourages buyers to consider towns outside London. 

The firm’s website advises that Swindon is one of the top places in Britain to buy property with prices that are up 20 or 30 per cent cheaper than similar towns.

Another firm with offices in Moscow and St Petersburg, All European Estate, advertises 2,368 UK properties, including family homes in Wales, the North West and the home counties.

Prices vary from £100,000 for smaller flats, up to £1million for large country retreats. 

Another site aimed at foreign buyers, lists two-bedroom flats in Manchester available in 2016, selling for £98,000.

An estimated 63million Chinese people are wealthy enough to afford a property overseas, according to Chinese estate agents Juwai.

Options: IP Global, in Hong Kong, said it is making its first foray into the Slough property market, and another Chinese firm is offering 'micro-apartments' in Sheffield and Manchester (pictured)

Last month Britain’s biggest buy-to-let landlords Fergus and Judith Wilson, who are selling 1,000 properties, said they expect them to be sold to an investor in China, but have also received interest from Russian buyers.

IP Global, in Hong Kong, said it is making its first foray into the Slough property market, and another Chinese firm is offering ‘micro-apartments’ in Sheffield and Manchester, promising rental returns of up to 8 per cent.

Industry insiders say some British properties are offered in China weeks before they go on sale in the UK.

Michael Sacks, of Sequre Property Investment, said foreign investors buying homes above their real value were ‘corrupting the market’. He said overseas investment had seen prices for two-bedroom apartments in Manchester go ‘through the roof’.

‘We know that Chinese investment companies are securing entire developments and then selling them to investors overseas for significantly more than they are actually worth, 25 to 35 per cent more in some cases,’ he said.

Cheshire-based property firm Assetz said around a third of its British sales in August were to Chinese buyers.

The British Property Federation’s Ian Fletcher said not all foreign investors who buy residential property are ‘looking to … make huge capital gains’ adding that ‘members have not found this to be a trend outside the capital’.

But campaigners have called for the Government to help UK buyers. David King, of Priced Out, said: ‘Foreign investment is driving up prices, making it even harder for ordinary people to get a decent place to live.’
