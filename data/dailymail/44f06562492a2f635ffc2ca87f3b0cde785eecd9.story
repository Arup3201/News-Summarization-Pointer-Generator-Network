New South Wales had the most sugar babes with more than 500 students turning to wealthy sugar daddies, with the University of Sydney topping the list with 207 registered babies, according to Seeking Arrangements.

Coming in at second place is Queensland, with 494 students connecting themselves with willing 'sugar daddies'.

Gold Coast tripled over the past year, with 142 Griffith University students registered - up from 44, while Bond University jumped from 21 to 100.

The third highest state is Victoria with 418 students using cashed-up older men.

Canberra was fourth on the leader board with 165 sugar baby sign ups, followed by Western Australia with 155 and in last place was South Australia with 129 students.

The statistics only show students who registered with their university email addresses, as part of an incentive to get a free premium membership.

With thousands of sugar daddies currently living across Australia, they are providing between $3000 to $20,000 allowance per month or even paying off university debts for their babies.

While Australia’s university fees have increased by 30 per cent over the past six years for local students, tuition for international students has increased 166 per cent since 2002, according to the International Education Advisory Council.

The new figures found college students now make up over 42 per cent of Sugar Baby memberships, making them the largest demographic on the website.

Seeking Arrangement is an American dating company that allows Sugar Babies to enjoy a life of luxury by being pampered with fine dinners, exotic trips and allowances from men who have an income of over $200,000.

An average sugar baby's age is 19-26 and the average sugar daddy is as young as 39.

Sugar daddies are mostly professional men – ranging from lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects, executives, corporate sectors and accountants.

‘Why hope for financial aid when you can guarantee it with a Sugar Daddy?’ Founder and CEO of Seeking Arrangement Brandon Wade said.

‘Student loans lead to endless debt, which amounts to more than a new graduate can handle. Sugar Scholarships provide real solutions to the problem of student debts,’ he said.

One Gold Coast woman, who wanted to be known as Annaliese, 39, told Gold Coast Bulletin that she was in an arrangement with one sugar daddy for nine years. 

‘I was drawn to it in the first place because I wanted to meet a better class of people – people I wouldn’t necessarily meet in my circle of friends,’ she told Gold Coast Bulletin.

‘They are normal, very successful and busy men – but they worry about the people who come into their lives – there’s not a lot of trust there.

‘This way they can filter out the people they’re interested in before they reveal their identities. 

'It strikes me how lonely people are – they’re disconnected because of business and sometimes they just want to be friends.'
