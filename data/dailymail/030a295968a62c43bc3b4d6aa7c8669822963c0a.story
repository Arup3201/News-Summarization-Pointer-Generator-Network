Britney Spears has been sued for accidentally breaking a dancer's nose after showing up in a 'disheveled and confused state' to a rehearsal for the 'Work B****' video.

The incident is said to have occurred while rehearsing for her music video on August 19 last year, TMZ reports.

Dancer and actress Dawn Noel claims that the 32-year-old was struggling to perform even the most simple moves when she arrived to the Woodland Hills studio to rehearse with her backing dancers.

In hot water: Britney Spears will apparently be served with a lawsuit on Monday after she accidentally broke backing dancer Dawn Noel's nose during rehearsals for her Work Bitch music video on August 19 last year

According to Ms Noel, she was standing to the side of the star when Spears twirled around in an unbalanced manner and extended her arms, whacking the dancer square across the face.

The plaintiff says the blow was of such considerable force that everyone in the studio heard a 'cracking sound'.

'Plaintiff Dawn Noel felt immediate 
intense pain and grabbed her nose, at which time defendant Britney 
Spears said "sorry" and then continued to attempt to learn the dance 
routine,' the lawsuit reads.

Seeking damages: According to Dawn Noel, the pop star was 'in a dishevelled and confused state' and twirled around in an unbalanced manner when she thrust her arms out to the side, smacking her in the face

Halfhearted apology: According to the plaintiff, the 32-year-old singer only offered an 'I'm sorry' and continued with rehearsals despite the dancer being in excruciating pain

Unable to 
take the discomfort any longer, Ms Noel sought medical attention half an
 hour later, during which she was told she had a nasal bone fracture 
requiring surgery.

Noel
 claims that although she was promised by the star's people that her 
medical bills would be taken care of, they've yet to cough up eight 
months later.

'After
 months of waiting for defendants to come through with their promise, 
and making certain that this incident did not become public knowledge to
 protect the privacy of all involved, defendants' representative then 
advised that they would not pay for any of plaintiff's medical 
treatment,' the lawsuit states.

Attorney Sark Ohanian of Carpenter, Zuckerman & Rowley will file the lawsuit on behalf of his client on Monday.

The
 specific amount of compensation Ms Noel is seeking has not been 
released but she is filing for damages due to battery, negligence and 
medical expenses.

Britney's representative did not return a request for comment.
