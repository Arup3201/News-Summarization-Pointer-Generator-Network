Former Tottenham and Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas believes Cristiano Ronaldo's ambition is unfairly mistaken for arrogance, and the Real Madrid forward should now be considered as the world's best player - ahead of Lionel Messi.

Ronaldo is in line to win the Fifa Ballon d'Or this coming Monday after another scintillating year for club and country - scoring 63 goals in all competitions.

The 30-year-old is up against Messi and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for the best player of 2014 award.

Zenit boss Andre Villas-Boas feels Cristiano Ronaldo's lofty ambition is misunderstood for arrogance

Ronaldo will be hoping for more success in 2015 after another brilliant year for him in 2014

And Villas-Boas - who now manages Zenit St Petersburg - believes Ronaldo deserves all the success that comes his way, after in his words incorrectly being labelled as 'arrogant' in the past.

He told Laures: 'I think sometimes drive and ambition of individuals should not be confused as arrogance, and sometimes Cristiano gets that tag on him. 

'He is a bit 'chased' publicly in some way and I do not understand why, but I think this kind of phenomenon happens to him.

'Cristiano does not get that margin of respect that sometimes Messi does, but you know hopefully this determination and passion has shown that for this time round he deserves to win it.'

In Villas-Boas' mind there is no doubt who he now regards more highly as a player, after previously favouring Ronaldo's compatriot and Barcelona No 10 Messi.

He added: 'In the past I have been in favour of Messi, but the drive, the ambition and the performances of Cristiano recently exceed limits.

'We are speaking about two of the greatest players in the history of the game.

'What I would say is that in this generation they are both incredible. I think Cristiano this year 2014 and also going back to 2013 has been amazing.'
