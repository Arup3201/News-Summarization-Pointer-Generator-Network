Whoops: French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he went to Fukushima but journalists with him in Japan deny it

Nicolas Sarkozy is facing ridicule after falsely claiming he visited Japan’s devastated Fukushima nuclear plant.

He told a presidential election rally that he went to the plant crippled by last year’s earthquake and tsunami.

But although he was the first Western leader to visit Japan after the tragedy, Mr Sarkozy never left Tokyo.

He told 5,000 supporters in Normandy: ‘I went to Fukushima…and unlike Francois Hollande, I can tell you the disaster was caused by the 42metre wave from a tsunami.

'Frankly, I don’t see the immediate risk of a tsunami in Alsace.’

Mr Sarkozy was speaking in defence of nuclear power, which his socialist challenger Mr Hollande has vowed to scale back.

The gaffe has been seized upon by his rivals. Mr Hollande, who is leading Mr Sarkozy in the polls for this month’s election, said: ‘This is the first time in the history of the French republic that a candidate has told of a voyage he never made.’

Two years ago Mr Sarkozy claimed he was in Berlin in 1989 on the day the wall came down, bragging on Facebook that he decided to leave Paris for Berlin on the morning of November 9, 1989, because he wanted ‘to take part in the event which was looming’.

Claim: This picture of Nicolas Sarkozy shows the now French president taking a axe to the Berlin Wall in 1989, but it was not when he claimed it was

Disaster: The stricken Fukushima plant was hit by a huge earthquake in March last year

He claimed he arrived in West Berlin the same day and then crossed Checkpoint Charlie to the East.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘The night 
continued amid general enthusiasm. The reunion of the German people 
signalled the end of the Cold War and the start of a period of great 
liberty in Europe.’

But, somewhat inconveniently, official
records placed the then 34-year-old mayor of the Paris suburb of 
Neuilly in France attending a service commemorating the death of General
de Gaulle on that day.

As a result, he was mercilessly mocked by the media.

Yesterday one socialist spokesman 
quipped on Twitter: ‘Nicolas Sarkozy is everywhere, on the Berlin Wall 
and at Fukushima. Now it’s the anniversary of the sinking of the 
Titanic…Was he on board? Mr Sarkozy has form when it comes to this.’

The presidential Elysee Palace said yesterday that it had no comment to make on Mr Sarkozy’s claims that he visited Fukushima.

Joy: East Germans climb the wall as it is taken down on November 9, 1989, but Nicolas Sarkozy's claims that he was there that night were found to be false
