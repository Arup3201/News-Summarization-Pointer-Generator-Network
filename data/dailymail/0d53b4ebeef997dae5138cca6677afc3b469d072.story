A pregnant woman caught short on the school run was refused permission to use the toilet in a police station because officers said they were not 'a public service'.

Kerry Belton, who is six months pregnant with her first child, was on her way to collect her younger sister from school when she entered Felixstowe Police Station in Suffolk. 

The 23-year-old asked staff if she could use the facilities, but was curtly told she was not allowed as the station was 'not a public service'. 

Kerry Belton, 23, was caught short for time when she ran into Felixstowe Police Station to use the toilets. But the woman, who is six months pregnant, was told the toilets they 'were not a public service'

After pleading with the employee behind the desk that she was pregnant, Miss Belton claims she was told: 'No buts,' and that she should walk into town.

Eventually staff relented and allowed her through with an officer accompanying her.

She has now lodged a formal complaint with the station after being left 'humiliated' by the incident. 

'I ran in and said "can I please use your toilet",' Miss Belton said. 

'He said "we’re not for public convenience, we’re not a public service" and I started to say "but I’m pregnant" then he cut me off and said "no buts".

“They told me I could walk into the town but being pregnant and having to walk that far, I wouldn't have made it.

'He eventually agreed but he was very blunt and made me feel very uncomfortable. If he was polite I wouldn't have minded as much.'

After being allowed to use the bathroom, Miss Belton said the officer pointed towards the door and told her: 'That's the way out.'

The mother-to-be said was left 'humiliated' by the incident and has lodged a formal complaint with the station

Miss Belton is six months pregnant with her first child. When she told officers she would not be able to walk into town in time to make the toilet, she was allegedly told: 'No buts'

'He said they weren't a public service but they are the police. I thought they were supposed to be a public service,' the 23-year-old added. 

Miss Belton was with her father, Nigel, at the time. The 46-year-old said he was 'disgusted' by the treatment his daughter received. 

'I am disgusted really. It is supposed to be a public service, I can’t believe he said that.

'I felt bad because I sent her in and she was humiliated.

'She is huge and there is no mistaking that she is pregnant.'

Police are investigating the incident after Miss Belton lodged a formal complaint. 

A spokesman declined to comment on their experience, but added: 'We aim to provide everyone with a polite and professional service and we would encourage anyone who is unhappy with the service provided by Suffolk Constabulary to contact us so we can investigate further.

'Police stations are operational buildings and as such it’s important that both police officers and staff are mindful of security and because of this the facilities are not available for public use.'
