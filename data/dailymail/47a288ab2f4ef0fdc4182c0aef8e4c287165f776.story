The celebrated Class of ’92, some of whom are destined to take charge of leading football clubs, have rubber-stamped their first managerial sacking as co-owners of non-League Salford City.

The Manchester United quintet of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville endorsed the Salford management’s decision to part company with assistant Stuart Rudd.

Popular former Salford player Rudd had caused the club embarrassment by sending Northern Premier League side Trafford FC winger Shelton Payne a text inquiring about his availability and telling him Scholes rated him. 

Salford, very aware of the need to conduct all their business correctly because of the scrutiny the Class of ’92 attracts, saw that the Rudd text could be considered an illegal approach — especially as it was made public on Twitter. Added to that was the use of Scholes’s name when the former midfielder has never seen Payne play.

Rudd is understood to be upset at the way he was dismissed by chairwoman Karen Baird this week without being given a reason shortly after being asked to sign a confidentiality agreement. Salford have announced Rudd’s departure as part of a ‘reshuffle’.

The reasons why 2014 FA Cup final referee Lee Probert (above) has not taken charge of a game since the Wembley showcase is another example of the chronic lack of transparency surrounding the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd. All they say is Probert is injured but will not reveal any more detail apart from him being due back on the elite referee match-list by the end of this month.

The Lawn Tennis Association, whose ridiculous extravagance was highlighted by the £640,000 annual package paid to Roger Draper, don’t seem to have learned anything since low-key Canadian Michael Downey took the helm.

New communications and marketing director Alex Mawer has decided he needs more help in promoting tennis so the LTA have promptly chucked another £200,000 a year at four more PR jobs described as ‘new unique roles’.

Boris Johnson will follow launching The Paddington Trail by being the official NFL coin tosser on Sunday

London Mayor Boris Johnson will no doubt revel in being the official NFL coin tosser on Sunday. The toss before a regular-season game has been done by the referee since 1921. But Boris is conducting the ceremony before the Jacksonville-Dallas game at Wembley.

Blame the topsoil, Roy

The FA are blaming the poor state of their Wembley pitch on too much topsoil being applied in the summer — rather than the American football games which have upset England manager Roy Hodgson.

It’s seen by the FA as a technical problem that can be resolved, with the surface back in pristine condition before two Rugby World Cup games and three NFL matches next autumn provide another big test.

Meanwhile, it has caused considerable surprise within the NFL that Hodgson should be so negative about American football at Wembley when FA general secretary Alex Horne had so recently described bringing an NFL franchise to the national stadium as a priority.

There can be no complaints for a change about England teams failing to utilise their £100million St George’s Park training facility during the upcoming international week. Seven England sides — seniors, Under 21, U20, U19, women, cerebral palsy and blind — will be in residence and all will be respecting the 11am two-minute Armistice Day silence on Tuesday.

A panel including Bruce Buck, David Sheepshanks and Kevin Keegan decided in their wisdom that the wholly unnecessary football business awards’ ‘outstanding contribution’ should go to former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon (above), who is now running football funds involved in third-party ownership outlawed in English football.

Junior rugby outfit Bracknell hold more Twickenham debenture seats than any club apart from Harlequins and Richmond. Bracknell’s savvy move was helped by club member and RFU grandee Jonathan Dance having devised the terms and conditions of Twickenham ticketing policy during his years on the ticketing committee, when he did everything by the book. Dance now occupies the best seat in the house as president of the RFU.
