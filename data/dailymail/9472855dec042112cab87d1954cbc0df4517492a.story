Two friends who went backpacking across Vietnam collapsed and died within days of one another from a mystery poison.

Canadian-born Cathy Huynh, 26, who taught English in South Korea, decided to take a week-long break with her friend and fellow teacher Karin Joy Bowerman, 27, from Illinois in the United States.

While sharing a room at the Son and Daughter guesthouse  in the coastal city of Nha Trang, Miss Bowerman fell ill and was taken to the Khanh Hoa Province General Hospital by her friend last Monday evening.

She did not have any apparent injuries, but was suffering from serious respiratory failure and her blood pressure had dropped to zero.

By 10.30pm that night, Miss Bowerman had died.

Two days later, Miss Huynh, who is of Vietnamese origin, was treated in the same hospital for 
symptoms of shock and while under intensive care, reportedly suffered
several cardiac arrests.

She died in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Forensic official Pham Xuan Thong said authorities have not been able to
determine the cause, but it was likely they had been poisoned.

He said samples will be analysed at the National 
Forensic Examination Center in Hanoi.

Authorities are co-ordinating with the U.S. and Canadian consulates in Ho Chi Minh City to investigate the case.

On Saturday, local authorities in co-ordination with the U.S. Consulate General in Vietnam completed a preliminary autopsy on Miss Bowerman but the results have not yet been announced.

According to Vietnamese newspaper Tuoi Tre News, the woman's family have requested their daughter be cremated in Ho Chi Minh City and her ashes sent to their Illinois home.

Miss Huynh’s family have refused to have an autopsy done on her as they say the two friends died in the same way so Miss Bowerman's autopsy would be enough.

'I’m deeply saddened and mournful,' Miss Huynh's mother, Huynh Thi Huong, told Tuoi Tre News, apparently sobbing.

Mrs Huong flew in to Ho Chi Minh 
City's Tan Son Nhat international airport from Canada at around 
10:00am on Saturday to complete the paperwork to bring her daughter’s 
body home.

'We would like to bring her body to 
Canada for funeral because all my family members in Canada want to see 
her for the last time.'

The 57-year-old mother has blamed doctors and nurses for her daughter’s death.

'I’m really angry at the irresponsibility of the hospital staff. She died because she did not receive proper medical care despite the fact that she had been admitted to the hospital 12 hours before her death,' Mrs Huong told the newspaper.

Cathy's brother, Michael, who came to 
support his mother said the family was struggling to come to terms with 
the devastating news.

'All my family members are extremely saddened by her death,' he said.

The family set up a website to raise 
the $40,000 needed to fly Miss Huynh's body back to Canada.

Tuoi Tre News reported that police investigating the mysterious deaths suggested the pair had died from drinking too much alcohol.

The
unnamed forensic investigator from Khanh Hoa province's police 
department told the newspaper he believed 'drinking too much wine' might
have led to the women's deaths.

But Mrs Huong attacked the claims, insisting her daughter was not a big drinker.

Beach destination: Nha Trang is well known for its pristine beaches and scuba diving and is fast becoming a popular destination for international tourists.

Picturesque: Holidaymakers are attracted to the area for its natural beauty.

'She often drank a little at parties but she never consumed beer or wine during vacations,' she said.

Dr Mai Dinh Trung, former head of
the Khanh Hoa Province General Hospital’s emergency service and 
intensive care unit, also ruled out alcohol poisoning as the cause.

On Sunday, an employee at the morgue 
of the Khanh Hoa General Hospital told Tuoi Tre News that Cathy Huynh's 
body had been was sent in without any clothes on, just a piece of fabric pulled over her.

When he was told that the victim’s 
family want her to have clothes on, the staff member said that the 
morgue would not supply clothes.

But he said he would ask the hospital to provide her with something to wear or would buy something himself because 'this is humane'.

Poisoned: Two Canadian sisters, Noemi and Audrey Belanger, pictured, were found dead in their hotel room in Thailand

The incident follows the recent deaths of two Canadian sisters in Thailand.

The bodies of Audrey and Noemi Belanger,
aged 20 and 26, were found on June 15 by hotel staff on Phi Phi island 
in the Andaman Sea, 800 km south of Bangkok.

Forensic officials found vomit in the 
room, blood on their lips and gums and their fingernails and toenails 
were blue. Lieutenant colonel Rat Somboon of Krabi Provincial Police added there were 'signs of serious food poisoning.'
