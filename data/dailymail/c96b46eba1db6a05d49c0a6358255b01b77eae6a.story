Pro-Union demonstrators made 'Nazi salutes' in front of police officers as Scotland's referendum vote began to turn nasty.

Hundreds of demonstrators waving Union flags arrived at George Square in Glasgow, which up until recently had been the unofficial headquarters of the pro-independence movement.

Glasgow voted in favour of independence in yesterday's historic vote which threatened to split the United Kingdom. Police confirmed that three people have been arrested following the disturbances.

Hundreds of men waving Union flags sang Rule Britannia as police contained them in a 'loose kettle'.

An estimated 80 police officers are trying to contain the demonstrators who are singing 'You can stick your independence up your a***'. 

The men also sang 'If you hate Alex Salmond clap your hands' and 'God Save the Queen'.

Many of the protester, who are mostly aged between 20 and 40, appear to be quite intoxicated. One drunken protester boasted that 'Glasgow would burn for voting Yes,' claiming it was now 'payback time'.

Police Scotland confirmed that they have been dealing with 'disorder' in the area.

Police deployed a human barrier to prevent protesters, who were lighting flares, from marching to other areas around the city

 A large number of the demonstrators attempted to move onto Cochrane Street but were prevented by the heavy police presence. 

As the situation deteriorated, demonstrators tried to gain access to Queen Street train station which was promptly closed by police. 

It is understood that some of the demonstrators are members of the far-right Scottish Defence League. Flags and banners associated with Glasgow Rangers were also spotted in the crowd. 

Earlier, one middle-aged woman wearing a Yes badge attempted to make her way through George Square during the demonstration when she was accosted by a group of men in their 20s. The men spat at the clearly shocked woman and called her 'scum'.

Several scuffles broke out as rival groups congregated in George Square which was regarded as the unofficial headquarters of the Yes Campaign

Police began the operation keeping apart rival factions around 4pm this evening when tensions increased requiring officers to intervene in the situation

Police Scotland said they had been forced to form a human barrier to prevent protesters from marching down Buchanan Street and away from George Square 

Some protesters also shouted 'scum' at police officers attempting to maintain order.  

Also witnesses claim they saw glass bottles thrown by demonstrators as tensions in the city escalated.

Union supporters and people sporting Yes badges argued over the referendum result and a chorus of Rule Britannia was countered by the Scottish anthem, Flower of Scotland.

Roads around the square were closed as police dealt with the incident. 

A large group of union supporters later gathered in George Square again, this time at the top of the square next to Queen Street Station.

They sang Rule Britannia and a flare was let off.

Traffic in Glasgow City Centre was brought to a standstill as police were forced to close several entrances to George Square while the protest contined

After several hours of confrontation, protesters began dispersing after 9pm 

Police formed a human barrier to block off the route to Buchanan Street and contain people in the square.

After 9pm the crowd scattered but smaller groups remained and the line of police officers stayed.

Mounted officers also remained at the scene.  

A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said investigations were under way which could lead to more arrests.

She said: 'Three people have been arrested so far in relation to the incident in George Square. Retrospective inquiries will be carried out which may lead to further arrests.'

Earlier, Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins asked the public to remain calm following the referendum result. 

He said: 'It is to everyone’s credit that they remained calm on a day of potentially high emotion and co-operated fully with our Police Officers and also the staff at Polling Places on a day when record numbers turned out to vote.'  

'This meant the ballot and count passed off smoothly and there were just a very few isolated incidents across the country involving a small number of alleged offences.'

Some pro-Union supporters made 'Nazi salutes' standing directly in front of Police officers attempting to keep rival factions apart 

He continued: 'Police Scotland had plans in place to ensure the safety and security of the Referendum and these worked. 

'I would also like to thank our Police Officers across the country for the hard work and effort they put in to ensure the day went well.'

Mr Higgins confirmed that over the period of the referendum ballot and count there were six arrests across the country mainly for alleged breaches of the peace and assaults.

'As we move forward the public can be assured Police Scotland is committed to keeping people safe. We will respond appropriately and proportionately to any issues which may arise.'

Pro and anti-independence supporters met in St George Square after lunch time with the situation rapidly deteriorating as anger and animosity was evident

When the first demonstrators arrived after lunchtime, the atmosphere was quite jovial with none of the later air of menace which developed 

Groups of Union flag waving demonstrators sang 'Rule Britannia' and 'God Save the Queen' as they congregated in George Square in Glasgow earlier this evening
