Celtic have opened talks with Scotland captain Scott Brown over an extended contract that could eventually see him take on a player/coach role at Parkhead.

Brown’s existing deal expires at the end of the season, by which point he will be just a few weeks short of his 30th birthday. The club have an option to extend the contract by a year but discussions have commenced with a view to securing a longer stay for the midfielder, who is set to skipper Scotland in the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday night.

Brown joined Celtic from Hibernian in 2007 for £4.4 million in what stands as a record transfer between Scottish clubs. He has been a mainstay for club and country ever since and his absence from Celtic’s early-season fixtures was seen within the club as a huge factor in the club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League.

Brown has made no secret of his wish to end his playing days in Glasgow and last summer he enlisted with the SFA’s coaching course at Largs in an attempt to secure his B license.

Celtic have been fully supportive of Brown’s coaching bid, so much so that he was in the dug-out alongside under-20s coach Stevie Frail for a recent SPFL Development League fixture against Hearts.

Manager Ronny Deila has spoken positively of Brown’s wish to eventually move into management and the new terms will be constructed towards an eventual move towards some coaching duties at the club.

A similar combined deal has been in the pipeline for Brown’s team-mate Kris Commons but talks have stalled, with former Celtic boss Neil Lennon said to be interested in taking last season’s player of the year to Bolton Wanderers in January.
