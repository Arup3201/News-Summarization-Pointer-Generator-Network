Tansu Kanlica, 27, of Atlanta, was arrested and is facing several charges including vehicular homicide and reckless driving.Â 

Kanlica was chasing 23-year-old Garrett Anderson in Kennesaw on Sunday night after Anderson had refused to pay him $175 for unlocking his car.

According to police, Kanlica was driving a silver 2004 Nissan on Barrett Lakes Boulevard approaching Shiloah Valley Drive just before 8 p.m. on Sunday.
