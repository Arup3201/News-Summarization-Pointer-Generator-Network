On an Olympic racing bike he had no equal.

But six-time gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy found four high-speed wheels more challenging than two on Saturday when he smashed a £125,000 supercar into straw bales at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

Sir Chris, 38, emerged unscathed and waved to fans after stewards rushed to the scene.

Trouble: Sir Chris Hoy span off the track at Goodwood and headed towards the hay bales

Impact: His Nissan supercar plowed straight into the bales during a race

Dramatic: The incident threw hay into the air as Sir Chris's car eventually came to a stop 

However, his 193mph Nissan GT-R Nismo was too badly damaged for him to continue.

After
 his West Sussex wipeout, Sir Chris – who last week announced that he 
and wife Sarra are expecting their first child – tweeted: ‘Well that was
 embarrassing! I’m fine but the car looks a bit sore!’

It is not clear whether the vehicle, one of only two in the UK, can be repaired. 

Since retiring from cycling in 2013, Sir Chris has taken up motorsport and races in the British GT Championship.
