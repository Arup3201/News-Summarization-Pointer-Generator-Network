Boris Johnson was today caught on microphone dismissing claims made by opponents of fire cuts as 'b*****ks'.

The London Mayor faced heavy criticism as he took questions during his regular session in City Hall.

But as he tried to defend plans to reduce the number of fire stations and firefighters, he was heckled from the public gallery.

Pressure: Boris Johnson faced a barrage of criticism about fire cuts in London as he took questions at City Hall

Outburst: After being accused of being a liar from the public gallery, the London Mayor was caught on his microphone muttering 'b*****ks'

Mr Johnson was accused of being a 'liar' and putting lives at risk by reducing the budget of London Fire Brigade.

Under his plans the number of fire stations would be cut by 10, with 14 engines and 500 jobs also axed.

As one heckler claimed there had been a rise in the number of fire deaths, the Mayor was heard to mutter: 'That is not true... b*****ks.'

Amid increasingly heated exchanges, Mr Johnson insisted his plans would not put lives at risk.

'One death from fire is too many; I won't be shouted at from the gallery, I am not being interrupted … when I am simply explaining the number of deaths from fire has come down. If there was any backbone,' he said, according to The Guardian.

He went on to tell Labour assembly member Andrew Dismore to 'get stuffed'.

Challenged to withdraw the controversial remarks, Mr Johnson eventually conceded he had been in the wrong.

'I'm sorry, I apologise to, to, to … It just popped out. I'm very sorry.'
