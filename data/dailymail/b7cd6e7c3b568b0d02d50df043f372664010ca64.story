As a television news anchor Kirsty Young always had to have her finger on the pulse and keep up-to-date with the latest stories.

But now the former Channel 5 News presenter is enjoying a slower pace of life after moving to the country with her family.

Kirsty, who turns 46 this month, told Marks and Spencer she's happier now she has a better work-life balance as she shares her fashion and interiors tips on the Style and Living section of their website.

More relaxed: Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young said she doesn't always have to have an 'ear on' to what's happening in the world now she's not a news anchor

Finger on the pulse: Kirsty covered major breaking stories in her role as news anchor for Channel 5, left, but now has a better work-life balance

The mother-of-two, who is married to Nick Jones, founder of the Soho House members' clubs, said: 'There was a point in my life where I felt that things were out of balance, and I felt as though my working life - and my husband's working life - dominated everything. And actually for me that's not the way I wanted to live my life. 

'So I wanted to move out to the countryside and luckily my husband said he would give it a go... and he now enjoys it as much as I do.'

The couple bought a home surrounded by fields in Oxfordshire which is far removed from their former environment in bustling West London.

'We have chickens – all named after newsreaders, respectfully – our dogs are always running around in the garden, they are very much part of the family,' Kirsty said.

The stylish Scot continues to work but now enjoys fronting Crimewatch on television and Desert Island Discs on the radio for the BBC after leaving her role as news anchor for Channel 5 in 2007.

During her time on the news front line, she covered major stories as they unfolded including the death of Princess Diana and 9/11.

But she said she's glad she no longer needs to be constantly switched on to world events.

'I used to be in the news cycle as a newsreader, so you always had to have an "ear on", but that's not my life now, so I fully take advantage of that. 

'And since we moved out of London and into the countryside a few years ago, I feel that I have more of an oasis of space around my family life that I didn't have before,' she said.

Kirsty said she particular enjoys being able to take time off at Christmas - something that wasn't always possible when she was a newsreader.

She told M&S that she is looking forward to spending the festive season with her husband and their daughters Freya, 14 and Iona, eight. 

She said: 'My perfect Christmas is at home and is totally off-duty. My husband takes 10 days off work, so we're there with our daughters and friends and family - no cars, no planes and no trains.'
