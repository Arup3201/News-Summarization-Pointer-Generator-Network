A baby girl who suffers from a rare condition that caused her head to swell to nearly double its size is recovering in hospital today after receiving life-saving surgery.

Following a series of preliminary procedures last week, 15-month-old Roona Begum, who was born with hydrocephalus, received a major operation at a hospital in Delhi, India, this morning.

Surgeons at the private hospital run by the Fortis Healthcare group, offered to treat Roona for free after pictures emerged of her living with the condition in a village in rural state of Tripura.

Success: Doctors said the procedure went 'perfectly' and that the results were 'better than expected'

Improved: 15-month old Roona, who was suffering from a buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to swelling has had life-saving surgery and the size of her head has reduced

Operation: So far doctors have reduced the swelling around 18-month-old Roona's head by nine inches

One surgeon Sandeep Vaishya told the AFP news agency: 'The surgery went perfectly, much better than expected.

After Roona's plight appeared in a number of publications, including MailOnline, a charity came forward to offer help.

Norwegian students, Jonas Borchgrevink and Nathalie Krantz, started an online campaign that raised $52,000 to help fund any further care needed.

The Fortis Foundation flew the 
poverty-stricken family from their rural village to the hospital in Gurgaon two weeks ago.

Worried parents: Mother Fatima Khatoon, 24, and 19-year-old father Abdul Rehman

Waiting: Parents Fatima and Abdul at the private hospital near New Delhi where their daughter is being treatedia.

New hope: Roona begum will undergo surgery to drain fluid from her brain tomorrow after a charity stepped in to help her

Doctors have already said that the 
youngster is lucky to be alive, with most sufferers of the condition not
 surviving beyond a year old.

Speaking before the procedure was carried out, Dr
 Sandeep Vaishya, Director of Neurosurgery at Fortis Memorial Research 
Institute, who is treating Roona, said: 'I was surprised when I saw the 
baby for the first time. Even though I had seen her pictures, I wasn't 
expecting the head to be so big.

'Her head measures 94 cm, in similar cases the average measurement is around 50-60 cm.

Getting help: Dr Sandeep Vaishya, from the Fortis Memorial Research Institute, examines Roona Begum,  who was born with hydrocephalus

Countdown:  Abdul and Fatima sit by their daughter's bedside in hospital ahead of  the life-saving surgery

Treatment: Roona is being treated at a private hospital after the Fortis Foundation offered to help

'It is swollen to an extent that she 
is not able to close her eyes completely. We have an opthamologist 
looking at her eyes, so that there are no complications there.

'We
 are hopeful that she will make a complete recovery. The challenge is to
 drain her brain fluid in a gradual manner, so as the brain gets used to
 it.'

Fatima said: 'When she was born, I wondered why do children of poor people like us suffer this fate?

Loving: Fatima Khatoon attempts to comfort her young daughter as she rests in her hospital bed

Poorly: Doctors say that Roona is lucky to be alive as sufferers of the condition normally do not live beyond a year

'Why is fate cruel to us? Why do rich people who can afford to cure their kids never get diseases like this?

'Before she was born, I went to a doctor twice. Once when I was one month pregnant and than when I was six months pregnant. We did not have money to go more often.

'She was born through a Caesarian operation and the doctor told us we had to take her out of Agartala to get her treated. But we did not have any money at all.'

But the devastated mother revealed some family members had been less than supportive.

Fatima added: 'When she is better, I hope my in-laws accept her. And she can have the love she deserves from her grandparents.'

Roona's father Abdul, 19, added: 'Even though our neighbours come and play with her, my parents have refused to acknowledge her existence, since she was born.'

Abdul, who earns the equivalent of just Â£1.82 a day as a labourer thanked those who had helped Roona.

He said: 'I cannot find work every day. Its hard enough to earn for food, so her treatment would have been impossible had it not been for the press and hospital people who have helped us.'
