A 22-year-old has complained to police after CCTV footage appears to show him being thrown onto the ground for filming officers making an arrest outside a Christmas Party.

Daniel Clements from Virginia was visiting a friend in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when he went outside the Varsity Theater during the event on Monday.

There he claims that he was subjected to police brutality and has filed an official complaint with the force. 

A number of officers were in attendance assisting paramedics treating a girl who had passed out.

Daniel Clements (pictured top left in the red shirt) was visiting a friend in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when he went outside the Varsity Theater during the event on Monday. He got his cell phone to film police officers making an arrest

One of the cops then notices and walks over to Clements, apparently grabs him and takes the cell phone out of his hand

Some of the cops then start to arrest another man, prompting Clements to take  his cell phone out.

However one of the officers notices, grabs him while he has his arm around a girl, and appears to slam him into the sidewalk after taking the phone. 

Clement was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on charges of public intoxication, battery on police, resisting an officer and remaining after forbidden

Clements, who admitted he had been drinking at the time, then claims that the members of the BRPD then laid their knees into him before handcuffing him.

He was then arrested, but has now filed an official complaint claiming there was an excessive use of force.

'I saw a police officer push somebody and I've always been told if something like that is going on, it's important to have an objective source of data for what happened,' Clement told WAFB.

'It (his cell phone) got ripped from my hands and as I turned to see who ripped it, another officer slammed me into the railing outside.

A friend who was with Clements is then seen grabbing the arm of the officer who arrested him. He was subsequently tackled to the ground then allegedly sprayed with mace. 

In the official report obtained by the station, officers said they arrived  to disperse the crowd. They claimed Clements refused to leave.

It also accuses the former student of jumping onto the backs of officers, which Clements denies.  

Clement was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on charges of public intoxication, battery on police, resisting an officer and remaining after forbidden.

However an internal investigation by the BRPD is looking into what happened.

Police spokesman Cpl. L'Jean Mckneely told WAFB there is very little he can say about the incident because of the ongoing internal affairs investigation. 

However he said it is not illegal to film police officers in the line of duty while they are out in public. 

Then the officer appears to throw Clements towards the ground beside the other arrested individual 

They then handcuff him before he is taken into custody. In Clement's official complaint, he alleges that police laid knees into his back as he was on the ground
