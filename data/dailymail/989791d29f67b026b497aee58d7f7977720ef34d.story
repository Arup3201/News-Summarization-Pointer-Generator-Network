The daughter of an organist murdered on his way to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve ended her year in happier circumstances by getting married at the same church 12 months after his death.

Father-of-four Alan Greaves, 68, was beaten with a pickaxe on his way to play the organ at St Saviour’s Church in Sheffield. He died in hospital three days later.

But on Saturday, just over a year after her father's death, the church was a scene of celebration when Emma Greaves, 38, married David Marshall, 40, surrounded by family and friends.

Emma, a police call handler, and her new husband, who is a chef, followed their wedding with a reception at St Saviour's Church Hall.

Alan's widow and mother-of-the-bride Maureen, 64, said: 'This time last year after Alan died we came together as a family and our grief was great.

'This year we came together as a family and it was a lovely, happy day for us.

'We spent the anniversary of Alan's death in the church hall getting everything ready for the wedding - it was very therapeutic.'

Maureen said the couple, who have their own allotment, grew almost all the ingredients for their wedding breakfast themselves including the wine.

They are planning to go on honeymoon in February to see the Northern Lights in Norway.

Maureen
 has thanked those who made donations to Alan's Appeal - a campaign to 
boost the food bank and shop set up by the couple in the weeks before 
Alan's death.

On Christmas Eve, she was joined
 by around 300 people for an emotional candlelit service at the spot where her husband was attacked a year earlier.

And she again called for forgiveness for
 stepbrothers Jonathan Bowling and Ashley Foster, both 22, who were 
jailed last July for the brutal and motiveless killing of the devout 
Anglican.

Reflecting on her year, Maureen said: 'The end of the year has been extremely mixed for me.

'We had a wonderful response to the appeal with donations of food flooding in.

'We
 had a lovely Christmas Day with all the family coming together to go to
 church and then eat dinner and play games. Then we went straight into 
preparations for the lovely wedding day.

'But Christmas Eve was very hard.

'For us that was the day Alan died as he never regained consciousness after that.

'I had a very lonely walk down to the church on Christmas Eve for the memorial service, thinking about Alan.

'It was emotional as this time last year he was so happy and looking forward to Christmas.'
