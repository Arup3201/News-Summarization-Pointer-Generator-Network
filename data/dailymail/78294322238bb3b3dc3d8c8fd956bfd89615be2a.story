Female prisoners at some of the toughest women only jails have been putting their names on waiting list for copies of Fifty Shades Of Grey after prison chiefs bought copies of the novel, it has been claimed.

According to a Freedom of Information request revealed today, taxpayers' cash has been spent stocking at least five prison libraries with the 'mummy porn'.

Now prison sources say the inmates, desperate to read the book, are putting their names on library waiting lists to get hold of it.

The book is stocked at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire - a 310-capacity jail, which was previously home to Soham killer Ian Huntley's partner Maxine Carr

A jail source added: 'Fifty Shades of Grey has proved massively popular throughout the female prison estate.

'Women
were constantly requesting the book from prison libraries but were told
it was not available, so in the end it was decided to get some copies 
in.'

It comes as Justice Secretary Chris Grayling orders all X-rated films must be removed from jails, but the crackdown does not include books.

The prison libraries which currently stock the novel include, HMP Low Newton in Durham - a 336-capacity jail which is home to Rose West and Tracey Connelly, mother of 'Baby P' Peter Connelly.

The book is also stocked at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire - a 310-capacity jail, which was previously home to Karen Matthews, who faked her daughter Shannon's kidnap,  and Soham killer Ian Huntley's partner Maxine Carr.

The 500 capacity HMP Holloway prison, in north London, where Chris Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce was briefly held, also confirmed it had the book on its prison shelves, as did HMP Askham Grange in York - the 128-capacity jail, which has been home to a string of notorious inmates, including child killer Mary Bell.

Other prisons stocking the best-seller, which features sado-masochistic scenes, include 446-capacity HMP New Hall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

It is not suggested that any of the women have borrowed the book.

The current female prison population is around 4,100.

The Ministry of Justice - which oversees Britain's jails - faces £2billion cuts from its £9billion-a-year budget.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'A huge number of prisoners struggle with reading.

'Better they read this than nothing at all.'

The Fifty Shades trilogy, written by ex-TV executive Erika Leonard using the pen name EL James, has sold more than 65 million copies worldwide.
