Li Li who was a student at the No.1 Primary School at Tiaobingshan County in Tieling city was only taken to hospital when she collapsed at the end of the day.

She kept silent as she began to feel increasingly ill as she had been told not to complain, but the little girl collapsed when she got home at home.

Her mum Chen said: 'She told me she had banged her head but she said she had been knocked by a friend's satchel - so I did not think much of it.'

Early the next morning, Li Li was in so much pain that her mum rushed her to hospital where doctors operated immediately to relieve the pressure on her brain, and she slipped into a coma.

According to  Li Li's father, Xuan Shimin, the little girl had almost died, and she now no longer wants to go back to school.

The school said that the teacher Yang Yali has an excellent reputation and insisted they had no idea what could have provoked the attack.

But Yang has admitted punishing Li Li during the class, saying: 'I didn't realize I hit her so badly.'

Li Li's parents are now demanding an explanation as to why the teacher is allowed to continue at at the school after the attack.
