A baseball fan's enthusiasm has him in critical condition after a tragic 50-foot fall from the bleachers of Montreal's Olympic Stadium on Friday.

The unidentified 40-year-old man was attempting to rouse the the crowd into doing the wave when he stood on the railing then plummeted to the ground head first.

It was an unfortunate end to an otherwise celebratory pre-season major league game, a rarity in the city since the Expos left in 2004, between the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets.

Tragic: Many of the 46,121 people who attended a pre-season MLB game in Montreal on Friday witnessed one fan plummet some 50 feet and land headfirst on the cement floor. An ambulance rushed to the scene and the man remained in critical condition Saturday

Witness Ian Tkach told CTV that the man was, like many of the baseball deprived Quebecois in attendance, in very high spirits as he stood at the front of the bleachers egging the crowd on.

He then took things a step further when he climbed onto the rails and, with his feet on the bottom rung, leaned toward the field.

He lost his balance and fell headfirst to the concrete floor below.

The stunned crowd watched in a hush as an ambulance hurried to the scene and carted the man away.

'[He] was seriously injured everywhere in his body, he's still in critical condition, we do fear for his life,' said Montreal police officer Danny Richer.

The man remained in critical condition Saturday afternoon.
