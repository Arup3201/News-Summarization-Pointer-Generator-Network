A pensioner was stabbed to death with a World War One bayonet because he had refused to buy another drinker a pint, a court heard.

Brian Kemp, 71, was sitting quietly at a table at the Black Horse pub, when Nicholas Jamieson struck 'out of nowhere'.

Mr Kemp, from Nottingham, was on holiday in Sidmouth, Devon, when he was attacked.

Exeter Crown Court heard Jamieson went back to his drink and smirked after the unprovoked incident, and then offered to help the dying man.

The pub's CCTV system captured footage of Mr Kemp's ordeal. It was due to be played in court today, but the judge intervened to say playing the 'shocking' video was not necessary. 

Jamieson, 43, denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility – a plea that was accepted by the Crown.

Prosecutor Simon Laws QC said: 'This was a completely unprovoked killing of an elderly man by the defendant with a serious psychotic illness.'

He said Jamieson, who lived opposite the Black Horse pub in the seaside resort, had bought the long bladed bayonet in April 2013 for £90.

He added that neighbours heard Jamieson 'throwing it into the floorboards' in his flat and spent time sharpening it on a sharpening stone and using a cloth to oil it.

Mr Laws said Jamieson told doctors that 'he could see the death it caused and the deaths it would cause'.

He said he could see 'both its past and its future'.

Neighbours complained that heavy drinking Jamieson played loud music at night and shouted and swore loudly to himself.

Jamieson used the pub and was seen by staff and customers as being 'strange' but not violent or physically aggressive.

But in the night in question, in September, Jamieson had drunk least five pints during the day and evening.

Mr Kemp was on his own and noticed that Jamieson was pestering a woman at the bar who he wanted to talk to but she had told him to go away.

Mr Laws said: 'Mr Kemp expressed his disapproval at what he was doing at one stage by tutting. It is not clear whether Jamieson noticed that.'

He said that Jamieson then asked Mr Kemp to buy him a pint, but the pensioner politely told him 'no'.

Jamieson replied 'that's f***ing rude' to Mr Kemp.

Mr Laws said: 'As Mr Kemp nursed his pint at 10pm Jamieson removed from his jacket his bayonet. He moved purposely to Mr Kemp and stabbed him in his chest.

'Nobody could have predicted it, coming out of nowhere. Brian Kemp did not see it coming at all.

'Mr Kemp slumped to his knees and Jamieson went back to his bar stool with a 'smile or smirk on his face' and carried on drinking.

'He did not acknowledge what he had done, said the landlord, and as a doctor and nurse tried to help the fatally injured customer Jamieson asked 'if he could do anything to help'. 

'A customer replied he had done enough.' 

Mr Kemp's family paid tribute to 'a quiet, gentle character' who kept himself to himself. 

'We are saddened and bitter that this has happened as Brian was having a pint, minding his own business,' they said.

Judge Francis Gilbert made a hospital order and said: 'It was a horrific crime. Mr Kemp was a stranger to the defendant.

'Mr Kemp entirely reasonably declined to buy him a drink.'

Forensic psychiatrists agreed that Jamieson was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and backed the S37 hospital order and restriction order.

Detective Inspector Gregg Dawe added: 'This was a particularly vicious and senseless attack on an innocent defenceless man. 

'It was also very distressing for those who were present and witnessed the incident at the time.'
