She's the Quality Street heiress with a passion for fashion, so the fact Millie Mackintosh used the steps of Bromley Magistrate's Court as an impromptu catwalk today should come as no surprise.

Millie, 24, played the role of supportive spouse to perfection at the court, where her rapper beau Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - was fined £525 and banned from driving for a year after pleading guilty to one charge of drink-driving.

Millie even tweeted details of her outfit to her followers: '#ootd Zara blazer, river island jeans, oasis jumper, top shop hat and miu miu glasses' [sic].

Rapper Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - was joined by supportive (and stylish) wife Millie Mackintosh at Bromley Magistrates court today

Fashion fan and model Millie was spotted making a quick dash to the shops yesterday, perhaps to pick out a new outfit.

Zara, of course, was her first port of call, having that sober yet sophisticated feel that a court appearance demands.

The former Made In Chelsea reality TV star posted a photo of herself on Instagram yesterday in the changing room of the Spanish-owned store.

She was trying on a cream crop top with a pencil skirt (accessorised by a set of killer abs) so may well have picked up this Zara Multicolour Woven Fabric Jacket, £89, which she's wearing today.

Black out: Millie wore a Zara jacket with a suitably sombre black top and a pair of figure-hugging leather pants, she accessorised with her favourite fedora

Putting her fashion foot forward: Millie's jacket may have been high street but her handbag was a £895 offering from Aspinal of London

She teamed the jacket with a suitably sombre black top and a pair of figure-hugging leather trousers.

She accessorised with simple black stilettoes, one of her signature fedoras, a suitably stealth wealth tote by Aspinal of London (which costs a cool £895) and a pair of Miu Miu’s Noir Glitter sunglasses.

The overall look: a more rock ‘n’ roll version of Breakfast at Tiffany's Holly Golightly accused with giving the ‘weather report’ to Sally Tomato.

All smiles: Millie, 24, accessorised with a simple black pump, one of her signature fedoras, and a pair of Miu Miu's Noir Glitter sunglasses

Skin tight: Millie opted for a pair of tight leather trousers, which showcased her toned legs

Professor Green, who was seen 
arriving at Bromley Magistrates' Court, Kent, this morning with his 
wife, was arrested on suspicion 
of drink-driving on November 3 last year.

The court heard that the star got behind the wheel of his Mercedes after being robbed of
his £40,000 Rolex watch on the doorstep of his home in Lewisham, south-east London.

As well as playing doting wife, Millie has been keeping busy in the gym and posted an Instagram video of herself pumping iron on
 Wednesday on her quest to perfect her already toned body.

The star, who is currently working with Claire's Accessories, has previously admitted she is keen to get stronger,
 and she is certainly going the right way about it if the latest footage
 of her lifting several weights in a series of positions is anything to 
go by.

Style sisters? Millie asked for her fans opinions on Instagram because she thought she resembled Kim Kardashian (right) in a Zara outfit she was trying on (left)
