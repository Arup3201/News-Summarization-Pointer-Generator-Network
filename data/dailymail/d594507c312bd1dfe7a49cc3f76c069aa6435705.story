A father's amazing project to send his son's favourite toy to the edge of space has become a YouTube hit.

Santa Cruz video producer Ron Fugelseth decided to document the heartwarming project

The video has been a huge success, receiving 200,000 views in 48 hours, and currently stands at over 770,000 views - and it expected to hit a million within hours.

The young child and Stanley, a toy train he has cherished for over two years

The video shows the entire project, from securing Stanley to the balloon to launch.

Once airborne, video cameras on the balloon capture Stanley as he rises high above the earth.

Video expert Ron has even added expressions.

'I animated Stanley's face with After Effects and Photoshop to bring him to life how I imagine my son sees him,' he said.

The doting father also addressed fears he could have hit a passing aircraft.

'I'm getting so many comments regarding safety that I think I should write a quick note to let everyone know of the precautions I took before launching Stanley into the sky.

'First off, I called the FAA 15 minutes before launch (per their instructions) so they could make sure no planes fly into the flight path.

'I read and followed all their rules for weather balloon launches.

'It had a homemade radar reflector, and a 3 foot parachute.'

Mr Fugelsmith also says he spent two months monitoring winds to predict where Stanley would land - and fitted him with GPs so he could be tracked and recovered.

'The prediction website was only 5-10 miles off, so he landed safely in a corn field, far away from any towns.

'I didn't want Stanley to be a murderer.

'Plus I wanted to make sure my son got Stanley back.'
