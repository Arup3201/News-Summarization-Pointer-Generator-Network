A 44-year-old man has denied murdering a policeman who was hacked to death during riots in Tottenham more than 28 years ago.

Nicholas Jacobs, who was just 16 at the time of the riots, was allegedly part of a mob who killed 40-year-old PC Keith Blakelock during violence on the Broadwater Farm estate in north London in October 1985.

But he told the Old Bailey today: 'I'm innocent.'

Father-of-three PC Blakelock was protecting firefighters while they tackled a blaze at a supermarket during the rioting.

But he is believed to have been set upon by a group of people shouting 'kill the pig' after he became separated from his colleagues.

PC Blakelock was stabbed 42 times and it is believed that his attackers tried to decapitate him, with the intention of displaying his head on a pole to send a grotesque message to his fellow officers.

He was eventually dragged away by colleagues but died later the same night at North Middlesex Hospital.

Jacobs was charged in July after he was arrested with 13 other men in 2010.

All 13 of the other men arrested have since been released without charge.

Bearded and wearing a striped white and 
blue shirt and jeans, Jacobs spoke in a loud voice to deny a single 
count of murder on October 6, 1985.

He was remanded in custody and will stand trial in March next year.

Jacobs, from Hackney in East London, was pictured earlier this year holding a sign protesting his innocence.

The sign read: 'I did not murder PC Blakelock.

'I was not there when PC Blakelock was murdered. I don't know who murdered PC Blakelock. I'm innocent.'

Three men - Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip - were convicted of PC Blakelock's murder in 1987.

But their convictions were overturned four-and-a-half years later.

Forensics tests on pages of key interview records suggested that they may have been fabricated.

The murder investigation was reopened in 2010 when a case review found that there were new leads.

PC Blakelock, originally from Sunderland, had been sent to the Broadwater Farm estate with his colleague PC Richard Coombes.

PC Coombes was also seriously injured in the incident and never served as a police officer again.

Trouble had broken out in north London following the death of 49-year-old West Indian woman Cynthia Jarrett.

She died from heart failure when police raided her home.

Officers had stopped her son Floyd, then 24, to inspect his car's tax disc. He was later charged with theft and assault at a Tottenham police station, but both charges were later dropped.

The incident sparked accusations that the Met Police was institutionally racist.
