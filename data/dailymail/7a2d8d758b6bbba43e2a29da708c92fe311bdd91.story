Accused: Robert Messer, 37, allegedly had a lengthy sexual relationship with a teenage family friend

A 15-year-old girl who ran away with a 37-year-old family friend before failing to carry out a suicide pact has testified that she first had sex with him when she was in the sixth grade.

The teenager said that she had instigated what became a three-year sexual relationship with Robert Messer, a man she had met at church when she was just five years old.

After the initial kiss, which occurred as they played video games at his house in Salem Township, Michigan, they went on to have sex 'often' before running away together last month.

He was arrested when they were found in a field with superficial wounds on October 29 and he now faces four counts of criminal sexual contact and one count of accosting a child for immoral purposes.

Judge Michael Gerou decided on Tuesday 
that there was probable cause to send the case to a higher Wayne County 
court and Messer will be arraigned in circuit court in Detroit on 
November 26.

Authorities have previously claimed that he has long groomed the girl for sex.

Testifying in court on Tuesday as the judge decided whether to send the case, the girl said that she met Messer as a child and that her mother and his then-wife became good friends.

But in middle school, she said she started to have 'emotional feelings' for him and she told him about these feelings, and that she wanted to have a physical relationship, MLive reported.

She said they began having sex when 
she was in the sixth grade and, while she could not remember her exact 
age at the time, it would make her about 12 years old. Messer would have
been 34.

Defense attorney Jonathan Jones quizzed her on her exact age - if she was 13, the 
first-degree criminal sexual contact charge could be lowered to third-degree - but she could not remember.

The first time they had sex was at his house. Afterwards, they got dressed and watched a movie, she said. They also had sex at her home in Plymouth Township, she said.

'We would have sex often,' she said. 'I was convinced I was in a relationship with him.'

Messer's ex-wife accused the pair of an inappropriate relationship a year ago, but both the teenager and Messer denied it. He and his wife, who have two teenage children, divorced last year.

Plot: Messer and the girl ran away in October and slept in his truck for two days after a failed suicide plot

So they went on to continue their relationship before deciding to carry out a suicide pact, she said. On October 27 they left her home at 8am and told her mother they were going hiking.

They left behind a note stating they were in love and their intentions to commit suicide, she said. After eating breakfast at his home, watching a movie and having sex, they headed to Maybury State Park in Northville.

They decided they would kill themselves with folding knives in the woods, she said, insisting that the decision had been mutual.

When they got to the park, they decided against the suicide and drove back to his home - but saw her stepfather's car and a police patrol car.

'I panicked and yelled a lot,' she said.

Instead they drove to a Salem Township field and stayed there for two days in Messer's pick-up truck.

They were then found by police and the girl was treated at hospital for superficial wounds.

Messer is being held on a 10 percent of $2 million bond.

The maximum penalty for first-degree criminal sexual conduct is life in prison, while third-degreeÂ  is a 15-year maximum felony. Soliciting a child for immoral purposes is a four-year maximum felony.
