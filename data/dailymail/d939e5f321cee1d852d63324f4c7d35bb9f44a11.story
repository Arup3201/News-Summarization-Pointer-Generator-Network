Detained: Officials believed the man they arrested was Saif al-Adel (pictured)

An innocent man with the same name as
one of al Qaeda's most senior commanders was arrested at Cairo 
International Airport after he was mistaken for Bin Laden's former 
security chief.

Officials have confirmed that 
Mohammed Ibrahim Makkaw, who was arrested shortly after arriving in 
Egypt's capital today, is not Saif al-Adel, as they had previously 
believed.

Mr Makkawi denied any links to the 
terrorist network and claimed it was a case of mistaken identity - 
something two United States officials have agreed with.

The Egyptian national's name matched 
one of al-Adel's aliases which was on an FBI most wanted list and he was
arrested on arrival at Cairo.

Mr Makkawi was arrested
after he disembarked the plane - which came from Pakistan via Dubai - and he was taken 
for questioning, security and airport officials said.

The FBI has listed that name on its 
most-wanted list as an alias for the senior al-Qaida leader known as 
Saif al-Adel, whose real name is Muhammad Ibrahim 
Makkawi.

Egyptian-born Al-Adel has been indicted by the United States for
an alleged role in the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in 
Tanzania and Kenya which killed 224 people.

He also was linked to the 2002 killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.

However, two U.S. officials also said the arrested man appears to have been mistaken for the wanted Al Qaeda leader.

The officials spoke on condition of 
anonymity to discuss intelligence information that has not been publicly
released. The FBI said it was still establishing details of the case.

William Carter, a spokesman at the FBI's headquarters, refused to elaborate on the matter, but added: 'We are aware that an 
individual has been taken into custody and every effort is being made by
the U.S. government to verify the identity of the person in custody.'

Saif al-Adel is a veteran figure in Al Qaeda, believed to have been the head of its military committee.

After the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks, 
he fled to Iran, where he was reportedly held under house arrest, though
it is believed he continued to be active and in recent years he was 
reportedly allowed to make trips to Pakistan.

Former militants who know both men have previously said they are two different people and the U.S. identification is incorrect.

But
Makkawi told reporters he was not Saif al-Adel and that he had nothing 
to do with the terror group since 1989. He said he traveled to Egypt 
using travel documents issued by the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad.

'What has been said about me is lies'

The 57-year-old said: 'What has been said about me is lies. I never took part in actions against people or installations.

'I
decided to come to Egypt to live in peace and because I am certain of 
my innocence.

'I have cut no deals with Egyptian authorities.'

Mr Makkawi gave his birth date as December 17, 1954. 
The FBI says Saif al-Adel was born in the 1960s.

Wearing a gray Arab 
robe and a jacket, Mr Makkawi looked nothing like the man in the photograph
distributed by the FBI as that of Saif al-Adel's. Makkawi has receding 
silver hair and wears glasses.

Mr Makkawi said that Saif al-Adel's real 
name was Mohammed Salah Zidan.

Montasser el-Zayat, a lawyer who 
represented Makkawi in Egypt, also revealed that al-Adel's 
real name was Mohammed Salah Zidan.

Al-Adel's FBI profile was posted in 
October 2001 when the FBI 'Most Wanted Terrorist' list was created - 
just a month after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The name 'Mohammed Salah 
Zidan' is not mentioned in the FBI profile.

Mr Makkawi added: 'I challenge any security
agency to prove that I am Said al-Adel, who is a different person whose
name is Mohammed Salah Zidan.'

A senior Egyptian 
security official involved in the case supported Mr Makkawi's assertion of 
innocence. The official said Mr Makkawi was a former army officer who left 
Egypt in the 1980s to join the fight against Russian forces in 
Afghanistan.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
