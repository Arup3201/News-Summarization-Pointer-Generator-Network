A military guard of honour greeted the Prince of Wales today as he arrived in South Africa for his - and the Duchess of Cornwall's - Commonwealth tour.

He was met at the door of his plane by dignitaries and then stopped to greet officials who had lined the carpet for his arrival.

Shortly after his plane touched down at the Waterkloof Air Force Base near the country's capital of Pretoria, Charles inspected the awaiting troops.

The Silent Honour 
Guard was made up of 30 South African Air Force and Army personnel, two 
of whom held the British Union flag and a South African flag.

His
wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, arrived in Johannesburg this morning and
the royal couple will make an eight day tour of South Africa and 
Tanzania.

The prince was 
treated to a stunning amber sunset as he touched down under blue skies. He wore a grey pinstriped suit with a blue shirt, a patterned tie, and a poppy on his left lapel.

The
heir to the throne was met by Dame Nicola Brewer, the British High 
Commissioner in South Africa, who introduced him to Miss Lindiwe Sisulu,
the Minister of Defence and Veterans Affairs and Ambassador Vusi Bruce 
Koloane, the Chief of State Protocol.

During
the visit to South Africa the royal couple will attend engagements in 
Pretoria, Johannesburg, Kwazulu Natal and Cape Town, before leaving on 
Sunday after a church service.

They will go to townships, community programmes, a nature reserve and sustainability projects.

Charles
will deliver a speech about climate change, and the couple will make a 
courtesy call on the deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, who is 
officially hosting them.

President Jacob Zuma is not in the country, as he is attending the G20 Summit in Cannes, France.

The Prince arrived from a brief tour of the Gulf, in which he visited Kuwait and Qatar.

The Duchess did not join him in the Middle East, but flew on a scheduled flight from London which landed this morning.

Charles visited South Africa in 1997 when he introduced Prince Harry to the country.

It is the Duchess's first official visit to the country, although she has visited privately.
