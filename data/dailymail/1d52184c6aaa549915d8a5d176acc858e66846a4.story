Archaeologists have discovered a set of 25 well-preserved Inca quipus, an ancient string device thought to be used for record-keeping.

The discovery was made in the ruins of Incahuasi, just south of Lima, among ancient warehouses known as kallancas.

The 600-year-old strings reveal just how advanced the Inca civilisation became, despite not having a known written language of its own.

Quipu - also called 'khipus' or 'talking knots' – are made up of coloured spun thread, and sometimes, strings from llama or alpaca hair.

As they weren’t uncovered in a funeral context, as is the case with other quipus, researchers believe that these may have been used for administrative purposes, according to a report in Peru This Week.

The belief is they helped in record-keeping, when authorities wanted to monitor items such as tax, military strategy or the population’s health.

A quipu has one main cord, called a primary cord, from which a number of other pendant cords hang.

The Inca Empire stretched from Ecuador through central Chile, with its centre in Cuzco, a city in the southern Peru.

The Incas called their empire Tawantinsuyu, the 'Land of the Four Corners,' and its official language was Quechua. 

When the Spanish conquered the Inca in 1532, they were a small ethnic group based in Cusco.

Despite their short rule, they controlled more than 12 million from 100 different cultures and speaking at least 20 languages. 

To support this empire, a system of roads stretched for almost 25,000 miles (40,000 km), which is around three times the diameter of the Earth.

While the Inca did not develop a formal system of writing, they did use  devices such as the quipu.

Researchers today are unable to read them, but they believe they would have been used for creating records such as a census.

Attached to these pendant cords are up to 12 additional cords, which are called subsidiaries.

Each quipu cord may have several knots, which researchers believe the Incan empire used as a decimal system of counting.

The knot type, researchers believe, may indicate the magnitude of a number in units of one, 10, 100 or more.

Their positions and colours likely revealed what was being counted such as gold, corn, or other products.

Incahuasi, where the latest discovery was made, was one of the most important strategic cities built by the Incas in the valley of Lunahuana.

Their empire stretched from Ecuador through central Chile, with its centre in Cuzco, a city in the southern Peru.

There are currently around 600 khipus held in museums and private collections throughout the world which date from 1400 – 1532 CE.

Many quipus were destroyed by the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century, making this recent find all the more significant.
