A band of self-styled 'Robin Hooders' has sparked outrage in a small New Hampshire city by filling expired parking meters with coins and lambasting traffic wardens for 'stealing' from citizens.

The six activists trail parking enforcement officers around the streets of Keene with video cameras, relentlessly questioning them as they try to issue tickets.

Now, after two failed legal suits, their targets have taken the case to the state Supreme Court, calling on a judge to issue a restraining order.

But the court claims it will likely be powerless to take action as it would infringe the protesters' First Amendment rights.

Dispute: The activists that go by 'Robin Hooders' claim parking officials are stealing from Keene's citizens

Do-gooders? These are two of the six 'Robin Hooders' filling meters with coins in Keene, New Hampshire

The group claims to have saved citizens $80,000 dollars in 2013 by preventing at least 8,000 tickets. 

Jon Meyer, representing the six 'Robin Hooders', told Fox News: 'The Robin Hood protesters are expressing themselves on matters of public concern literally in the public square and holding government officials accountable.

'It's very important from a constitutional perspective that their expression not be undercut or restricted. They are doing this in a peaceful fashion.' 

Addressing the court on Wednesday, he added: 'The peace of mind of the parking enforcement officers is not a compelling interest.'

When the group, which is also goes by Robin Hood and His Merry Men, finds an expired meter they refill it with change and then place a card notifying the car's owner what has happened.

'Your meter expired,' read the notes. 'However, we saved you from the king's tariffs, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Please consider paying it forward.' 

'Harassment': Parking attendents claim the protesters are harassing them and call for a restraining order

Followed: The activists follow the traffic wardens around the streets with cameras questioning their morals

Widespread: They claim to have prevented at least 4,000 parking tickets from being issued in the city

Also on the note is an address where those inclined can send money to the 'Robin Hooders'.

The city of Keene's lawsuit - which has yet to be concluded - alleges the group has 'regularly, repeatedly, and intentionally taunted, interfered with, harassed, and intimidated the PEOs [parking enforcement officers] in the performance of their employment.'

'What we're asking for is to please step back, out of the face,' said the parking attendents' attorney Stephen Buckley.

The suit names six members of the group and formally requests the court bar them from coming within 50 feet of the PEOs while they are on duty. 

'Robin Hooding is about saving people from getting parking tickets,' writes member James Cleaveland (aka James Robin Hood) on a website associated with the group called FreeKeene.com. 

'The city has resorted to a civil case against me and others instead of a criminal one providing more evidence that no criminal actions were committed.'

Cleaveland claims the group has stopped the city from issuing 8,000 tickets.

Court case: The case has been taken to the state Supreme Court after the officers' two legal suits failed

Another member, Ian Freeman, told WMUR: 'They don't want to feel like they're doing a bad thing. I think they are.'

The case has yet to conclude, and city attorneys claim they will be arguing that a buffer would not infringe the activists' rights.

City attorney Charles Bauer told FoxNews.com: 'I believe in the First Amendment – that's what this country is built on.

'We're not trying to get them to stop their conduct – it's the proximity and duration.

'They're bumping into, swarming around within very close proximity [of the parking officials]… running up closely behind them, spooking or scaring them. 

'They shout at them, calling them bad things, like "bitch" and "racist" and "boy".'
