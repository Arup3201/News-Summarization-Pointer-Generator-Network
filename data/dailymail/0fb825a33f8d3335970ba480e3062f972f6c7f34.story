The Columbian prostitute who rocked the U.S. Secret Service with sex scandal allegations plans to reveal intimate details of the saga in a new book.

Escort Dania Londoño caused a storm earlier this year when she revealed that at least ten secret service agents had picked up prostitutes in Columbia brothels - and that one agent refused to pay.

She will now tell her story in a book called Room Service, which is likely to further embarrass the Secret Service even further.

Scandal that rocked the service: Dania Londoño (in an image she posted on Twitter) alleged that an agent refused to pay her $800 for intimate services

The scandal began following a dispute over payment at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena on April 12.

One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez, she said in a recent interview.

She explained during a televised interview that during the 
transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the 
words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash' and dinero' to get the point across.

She claims the pair then had 'normal' sex 
and the agent then fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal 
whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do.

Secret Service employees in the last five years

The
24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay,
she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - 
which was when he became 'very angry'. 

The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door on her.

This led to the police getting involved, sparking a Secret Service investigation.

She also claims eight members of the U.S. military used girls from the Cartagena brothels.

The incidents occurred just a few days before President Obama arrived for a summit, and led to a wave of resignations as the details became public.

Following the scandal, Londoño moved to Spain, saying her security was compromised.

However, two prostitutes have also claimed that the scandal was engineered by Londoño and a Dubai-based businessman to embarrass the service - a claim she strenuously denies.
