Victor Moses has returned to Chelsea after being ruled out for the season.

The winger has been on loan at Stoke but damaged his hamstring in the 1-1 draw at West Ham United on Saturday and is expected to be out for six weeks.

The 24-year-old has gone back to parent club Chelsea for treatment following the results of a scan. Stoke are still keen to strike a permanent deal for Moses in the summer.

Meanwhile, the Potters have opened talks with Ligue 1 side Evian over the possible transfer of defender Daniel Wass - who has been watched by Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle over the past year.

The 25-year-old Denmark international is available for around £3.5million and is keen to try his luck in the Premier League, despite interest from the likes of Inter Milan and Schalke.

Hughes has been given licence to spend this summer with players including Moses, Manchester United forward Javier Hernandez and Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole on his wishlist. 

Stoke scouts have also been monitoring Sporting Lisbon pair Islam Slimani and Andre Carrillo.
