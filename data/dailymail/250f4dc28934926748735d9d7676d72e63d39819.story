Tributes have been paid to journalist and broadcaster Simon Hoggart who has died aged 67.

Hoggart, who died yesterday, is perhaps best known as the long-standing host of BBC Radio 4's News Quiz until 2006.

He was also a prolific writer, spending a lot of his career writing for the Guardian - including a long stint as its parliamentary sketchwriter.

The writer was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer several years ago but continued to work until recently, the Guardian reported today.

As well as his countless dispatches from Parliament and party conferences, Hoggart was the author of dozens of books.

Referring to his time at the helm of the 
News Quiz, his Radio 4 colleague Corrie Corfield said: 'Like to think 
that somewhere rather special Simon Hoggart is now being told to get a 
move on by Alan Coren, with lovely Linda Smith laughing.'

Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said he wrote with 'mischief and a sometimes acid eye about the theatre of politics'.

He
 said: 'A daily reading of his sketch told you things about the workings
 of Westminster which no news story could ever convey. He will be much 
missed by readers and his colleagues.'

Numerous notable figures from the media industry took to Twitter to express their condolences today.

Radio host Jeremy Vine wrote on Twitter: 'Simon Hoggart was one of the cleverest and funniest writers in the newspaper world and also a lovely chap. RIP.'

Newsreader Susanna Reid wrote: 'A truly charming, funny, intelligent - and kind man. Simon Hoggart, you will be missed.'

Associate editor of the Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire ‏wrote: 'Hugely saddened by the death of my friend Simon Hoggart. He was a kindly, thoughtful, witty & curiously shy man. RIP'

Conservative MP Michael Fabricant, a regular target of Hoggart's sketches, said: 'Such sad news. He teased me mercilessly but always kindly.'

Hoggart, the son of literary critic and academic Richard Hoggart, grew up in Hull and then Leicester before joining the Guardian in Manchester.

Despite being told his illness would kill him, he continued to work for three and a half years writing his final column just three weeks ago on December 19.

However, last month his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the Royal Marsden hospital.

He made it home to his family on Christmas Day and according to The Guardian visitors said he continued to sound off.

Alan Rusbridger added: 'Simon was a terrific reporter and columnist – and a great parliamentary sketchwriter.

'He wrote with mischief and a sometimes acid eye about the theatre of politics. But he wrote from a position of sophisticated knowledge and respect for parliament.

'A daily reading of his sketch told you things about the workings of Westminster which no news story could ever convey. He will be much missed by readers and his colleagues.'
