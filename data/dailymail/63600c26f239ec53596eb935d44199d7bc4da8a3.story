Brave Captain Scott before his ill-fated journey

It is a tale of adventure and bravery that ended in tragedy.

But a theory about Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the South Pole sheds a rather more sinister light on the subject.

Academic Chris Turney, of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, says one of the team may have eaten more than his fair share of food, leaving the others starving.

On their way to the Antarctic, the adventurers stored depots of food and fuel to sustain them on their return journey in February 1912.

But Mr Turney has discovered archive material suggesting the men found less food than expected at a critical point on the way back.

He suggests that this was because Teddy Evans, Scott’s second-in-command and one of three men who turned back before the final stretch, ate too much food.

Starving and exhausted, Scott and three other men died just 18 kilometres from their final food depot.

Had they reached it, they probably would have survived.

Although it is already known that adventurers found food and fuel supplies unexpectedly low at some of the depots, Mr Turney claims he has new evidence of a further shortage.

He also claims that this has been hushed up over the years and that a wife of one of Scott’s team erased notes her husband had made.

His claim is based on notes from two meetings in April 1913 between George Curzon, president of the UK’s Royal Geographical Society, and the widows of Scott and team member Edward Wilson.

In the first meeting, Kathleen Scott pointed out entries in her husband’s diary complaining about food shortages and the ‘lack of thoughtfulness’ of other members of the expedition.

In a separate meeting, Oriana Wilson told Curzon that her husband’s diary contained a passage complaining of an ‘inexplicable’ shortage of food on the return journey on which he died.

Mr Curzon also noted that Mrs Wilson was determined to keep the notes secret and that notes had been erased, possibly by the widow.

Mr Turney believes Wilson was referring to a depot that Scott and the surviving men reached on 24 February 1912.

He lays the blame with Mr Evans, who travelled south with Scott but turned back alongside two other men with about 200km to go.

Mr Evans fell ill with scurvy on the return journey and had to be pulled on a sledge by his two companions, which may explain why they needed more food.

Mr Turney also argues that this was all hushed up by Mr Curzon.

He said: ‘Curzon could not risk the story getting out. Scott and his companions had been declared heroes.

‘To suggest that one of the returning teams had helped themselves to more than their fair share of food, contributing to the men’s deaths, would have changed everything.’

Scott’s diary for February 24 mentions a significant fuel shortage and, three days later, he writes that the team had less food than they expected to have.

Mr Turney makes the claims in his book 1912: The year the world discovered Antarctica, published this week.

But Roland Huntford, author of a dual biography of Scott and his Norwegian rival Roald Amundsen, disagrees that Mr Evans can be blamed.

He said: ‘The food depots were badly organised and it would have been all but impossible for Evans and his men to know how much food was rightfully theirs.

‘It was entirely Scott’s fault because of poor organisation.’
