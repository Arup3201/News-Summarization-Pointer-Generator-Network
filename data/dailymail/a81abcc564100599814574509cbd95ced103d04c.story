A man waiting for a sex change operation accused of raping and sexually assaulting a woman has gone on trial.

Nadine Natasha Williams, 38, who used to be known as Dean Williams before he changed his name by deed poll, denies raping the woman in Neath, south Wales in October 2011.

Williams, from Pontrhydyfen near Port Talbot, also denied two counts of sexual assault relating to the same woman on the same date.

A jury of eight women and four men was sworn in for the trial at Swansea Crown Court but no evidence was heard.

Judge Peter Heywood explained to the jury: 'He’s altered his name by deed poll and as I understand it he is transgender and is awaiting a sex change operation in due course.'

The trial is expected to last into next week and was adjourned for legal reasons.

The prosecution is expected to open its case tomorrow.
