The name Joel Campbell isn’t one that was taken altogether seriously until February 25.

This was a youngster who had been signed speculatively by Arsene Wenger three years previously and one - via a trio of loan spells largely down to work permit issues - who wouldn’t be knocking on the first team door for a good while.

That was until he picked up a ball 30 yards from goal against Manchester United during that night in the Champions League last-16.

Those along the corridors at London Colney stood up and took rather more notice when the Olympiacos man strode on to a loose ball, made Michael Carrick look less-than-handy by sidestepping him with ease and bent a wicket effort beyond the despairing David de Gea.

Eyebrows raised, eyes slightly widened; is this the man - farmed out to Greece after tricky spells with Real Betis and Lorient - Arsenal have been missing?

The answer already appears to be yes, given Wenger’s admittance that Campbell would be on his way back to the club for pre-season after three campaigns away. ‘He will definitely come back to us,’ Wenger told Sportsmail after Costa Rica’s drubbing of Uruguay. ‘He is maturing well.’

Campbell has been the Central Americans’ star of this tournament thus far, scoring in that 3-1 win against Edinson Cavani and co while putting in a more disciplined and resolute shift against the Italians on Friday night.

And he now has the opportunity to hammer a final nail into England’s coffin when the sides meet in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday.

Roy Hodgson’s men are already booked on the first flight out of South America when the whistle is blown on a wretched campaign that began with enthusiastic hope rather than searing expectation.

The goodwill shown towards the manager - who rightly, on the whole at least, chose to blood the youngsters in the first two defeats - will be somewhat tempered if they suffer the ignominy of losing all three group games.

With Campbell pulling the strings for Costa Rica, that is a very real possibility.

While his goal against Uruguay was well-taken - particularly his decision to hang back on the edge of the box to wait for the second ball - there were two other moments that will have Hodgson twitchy.

The first saw the 21-year-old, as against United in February, pick up a ball way out, drive at the Uruguayans and send a stinging effort just wide; the second he pulled to the right, checked inside before crafting a beautifully-weighted ball alongside the centre-half for Marco Urena to poke home. Enchanting in its simplicity.

It is from those pockets - Robbie Savage would tell you they are ‘between the lines’ - where the Three Lions could suffer.

The manager is likely to play Frank Lampard in the middle of midfield, and he could be paired with Jack Wilshere - their primary job to stop Campbell roaming deep and dictating proceedings.

A lack of pace and protection in that area has been England’s undoing, although it’s debatable whether that obvious problem will be fixed in time for Tuesday given the personnel thought to be in the XI.

And then there is Campbell’s naivety of youth which is likely to trouble the full-backs. He sees no issue in neglecting his central station to go and have a roam wide. It’s refreshing to watch.

For all of the new-age England we’ve witnessed over the past ten days, those Savage lines and covert rotation, there hasn’t been one man to drop off and purposefully pick holes.

Couple Campbell’s innocence with some blistering pace and confidence in possession - see his penalty appeal against the Italians for reference - Arsenal have a real player on their hands.

The only potential difficulty will be his ability, or otherwise, to heed strict instructions, although in the first two games he seems adept at tracking back and helping the midfield five.

‘I believe I’m ready to play for Arsenal next season. I have the capacity to play there and I am only waiting for the opportunity,’ he said this week.

No kidding, and England could find out to their cost.
