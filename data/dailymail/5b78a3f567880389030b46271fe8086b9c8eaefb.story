Despite the fractions between the manager and some senior players at Barcelona, Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta were all smiles as they posed with their individual gongs from the Ballon d'Or gala.

Messi finished runner-up to Cristiano Ronaldo in the race to be crowned the best player on the planted at Monday's ceremony, while the Argentine and Iniesta were both named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI team of the year.

A photo appeared on the front cover of Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo on Wednesday, as the pair were snapped on a Ballon d'Or jet looking pretty pleased with their awards.

The duo may not have been so thrilled about returning to their day jobs, however, as reports of fall-outs between Messi and other players and coach Luis Enrique continue to dominate Barcelona's season.

The four-time Ballon d'Or winner is thought to be unhappy with Enrique being in charge. The former Barcelona player returned to the Catalan club in the summer after spells in charge at Roma and Celta.

In recent weeks, suggestions that Messi might quit Barcelona have gathered pace and the 27-year-old fueled speculation further by admitting at Monday's ceremony that 'I don't know where I'll be next season.

The forward sparked rumours of a switch to Chelsea after following the club's Instagram account and naming Jose Mourinho on his list of top-three coaches.

It is more likely, however, that Messi's flirtations with the idea of leaving Catalonia is a ploy to ensure Enrique is not still Barcelona head coach at the start of next season.
