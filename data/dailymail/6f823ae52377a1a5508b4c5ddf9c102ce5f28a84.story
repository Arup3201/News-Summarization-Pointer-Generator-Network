Frank Sinatra's assistant has revealed juicy details of the legendary singer's bad behavior and his callous treatment of the stunning women who loved him.

Tony Consiglio's interviews are the basis from a new book Sinatra and Me: The Very Good Years,  released following his death in 2008. It tells of his 50 years working for his former high school friend from Hoboken, New Jersey.

Consiglio told of one episode where Sinatra ordered him to throw a plate of spare ribs covered in sauce in the face of a glamorous starlet he was dating.

The memorable incident happened when the two friends were drinking at the Claridge Hotel in Atlantic City. 

The actress who was romantically involved with Sinatra had earlier offended him with her political views. When she went to slip into sexy negligee, the singer ordered Consiglio to follow her up to the  hotel room with a special request.

He said: 'I went to her room and 
knocked on the door. She opened the door wearing a beautiful light 
chiffon dressing gown over a transparent white negligee...I told her 
that I was sorry to bother her, and that Frank had insisted that I 
deliver the spareribs.

'When she reached out for the plate I 
hit her in the face with the ribs, sauce and all. I apologized again and
went back to the suite,' according to the New York Post.

Consiglio told about his many 
years by Sinatra's side to journalist Franz Douskey in a series of 
interviews before his death in 2008. For years he had been known as the 
'Clam' for keeping his boss's secrets.

Even after Sinatra's death in 1998, Consiglio kept the star's secrets - only opening up in the months before his own death ten years later.

The loyal employee revealed one 
incident where Sinatra sent him to find his then wife Ava Gardner's 
wedding ring after she threw it out of a 14-story hotel room window during an 
explosive fight.

As Sinatra and Gardner made up, 
Consiglio checked the New York sidewalk with a flashlight for hours and 
eventually found the ring under a fire hydrant.

The book was published earlier this 
month and contains dozens of never-before published photos of the two 
friends spanning from the 1930s to 1970s.

The
valet said that he enjoyed taking care of Sinatra's day-to-day needs - 
allowing the crooner to focus on the music.

He kept up to $20,000 in his
pockets to deal with Sinatra's ever-changing whims. 

In
another legendary incident, Sinatra decided that he didn't want 
Consiglio to be gambling despite the fact he wasn't working at the time.

He dutifully obeyed but Consiglio's loyalty did not go unrewarded this time.

Consiglio
recalled that within the hour, a 'tall blonde' was sent to his hotel 
room, to make sure he didn't return to the casino - causing him to remain in his room for three days.
