Stephen Hawking’s first wife has revealed how the world-famous physicist’s illness forced them into their own ‘black hole’ of despair.

Jane Wilde, who was married to the scientist for 25 years, says the couple were ‘engulfed and then swept away by a wave of fame and fortune’.

She added: ‘It got rather too much for me to cope with. We ceased to be happy as before.’

Professor Stephen Hawking has revealed how he thought he may never finish his book, A Brief History of Time, after falling desperately ill in 1985

Speaking in a new film to coincide 
with the release of the award-winning cosmologist’s memoirs, Miss Wilde,
the mother of his three children, describes how there were ‘two faces 
to Stephen’.

‘One was the public wunderkind who had
overcome motor neurone and was travelling the world. The other was our 
home situation where his illness forced us into our own black hole.’

Prof Hawking, 71, met Miss Wilde while
studying at Cambridge when he was 21. Soon afterwards he was diagnosed 
with motor neurone disease – a condition which has left him 
wheelchair-bound for almost half a century and able to communicate only 
through a voice synthesiser operated by a muscle in his cheek.

Prof Hawking describes how he became 
so desperately ill with pneumonia while he wrote A Brief History of Time
that doctors offered his wife the chance to end his misery and turn off
his life-support machine. But Miss Wilde refused to do so and her 
husband went on to complete the bestselling book which has sold 10 
million copies in 40 languages.

Prof Hawking describes the near-death 
experience in 1985 as the ‘darkest’ time of his life and explains how it
was the treatment for this illness which left him unable to speak.

He said: ‘It was very serious and I was put into a drug-induced coma and then on a life-support.

‘The doctors thought I was so far gone that they offered Jane [the option] to turn off the machine.’

But she refused and ordered doctors to fly her husband, who was in Geneva when he fell ill, back to their home and Cambridge.

He added: ‘Slowly the drugs worked, though a small incision in my throat robbed me of my ability to talk.’

In the film, Miss Wilde describes the 
early days of their relationship, saying: ‘I was drawn to his very wide 
smile and beautiful grey eyes. He  was great fun and we were together 
going to defy the disease and the doctors.’

A Brief History of Time was finished 
in 1987 and Prof Hawking had become famous around the world, but the 
fame – coupled with his ill health – led to the collapse of his 
marriage.

Prof Hawking married his former nurse, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They divorced in 2006.

He describes his second marriage as 
‘passionate and tempestuous’, but dismisses allegations that he suffered
physical abuse at his wife’s hands.

Life expectancy for motor neurone 
disease sufferers is about five years, but Prof Hawking says he is not 
afraid of dying. He added: ‘Every day could be my last and, though I’m 
71 now, I go to work every day. I have a desire to make the most of 
every minute.’
