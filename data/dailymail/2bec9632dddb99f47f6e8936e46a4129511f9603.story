Police have charged a 14-year-old girl for an assault where a young woman was dragged from her car, pulled around by her hair and repeatedly kicked and punched. 

Disturbing video of the 'feral' incident, thought to have occurred in a car park at Lake Haven on the New South Wales Central Coast last Monday, has been shared more than 5,000 times on Facebook.

In mobile phone footage, a male bystander is heard egging one of the two attackers on, saying 'smash her, smash the f*** in the face, bust the c***'s face open'.

The wild brawl began after the blonde victim was set upon by a woman as soon as she turned up in a silver sedan.

She was pushed to the ground but quickly managed to regain the upper hand - despite the verbal abuse of several bystanders. 

Another girl then joined in the fighting, attacking the blonde victim and forcing her to the ground. 

One of the two attackers then held the victim by the hair and landed more than a dozen blows to the back of her head.

As the victim fled to her car, one of the alleged attackers shouted 'don't talk s*** again' and then charged at the car.

As the fuming assailant stormed off, she was complimented by a male friend dressed in football shorts. 'That's how it's done babe,' he said.

A NSW police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the 14-year-old will front the Children's Court on January 13. 

'Officers are still looking for the second girl and expect to lay further charges,' he said.
