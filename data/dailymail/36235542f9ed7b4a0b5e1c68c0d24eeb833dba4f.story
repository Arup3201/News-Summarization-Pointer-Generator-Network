Britain could be forced to accept a flood of young asylum seekers who are allowed to 'shop around' for the best nation to settle in.

A key adviser to Europe's most powerful judges believes that the UK should lose its current right to send refugees back to the EU country they first arrived in.

Luxembourg's Advocate General Cruz ­Villalon said yesterday that asylum seekers under the age of 18 should not be sent back to where they first landed if they are on their own.

The Spanish-born lawyer admits that it could lead to the 'undesired effect' of allowing youngsters the chance to pick and choose where they want to go in the European Union.

Rules: Young asylum seekers should be given the chance to 'choose' Britain even if they have arrived in other EU countries, an influential lawyer has said

'Asylum seekers may be tempted...to choose the member state where the law which is most advantageous to them will be applied,' he said, but maintained it would be for the best.

It has caused fury among politicians who accused the EU of trying to force the UK to bend over its own sensible rules.

Row: Tory MP Dominic Raab has said it is another example of Brussels trying to force Britain to change their rules

'This is a classic example of ­Brussels seeking to expand rules that democratic governments have signed up to,' Tory MP Dominic Raab said.

'It creates a real risk that Britain will be caught up in a swath of new EU human rights rules that its elected representatives have had no say in – with far-reaching consequences for UK border ­controls and democratic accountability.'

Cruz Villalon was giving his view based on an immigration case involving Britain.

Two Eritrean minors and one Iraqi Kurd have applied for asylum in the UK, but it then emerged that they had previously tried the same in Italy and the Netherlands before making their way to the British border.

All three, who were aged between 15 and 17, arrived alone between 2008 and 2009.

The UK uses the Dublin treaty to send people back in many cases like these. One of the ayslum seekers has been deported and the other two have their cases pending.

The UK High Court sent their paperwork to Luxembourg for clarification, on which Mr Villalon has produced a legal paper.

There are deep concerns about the consequences of his argument.

UKIP Gerard Batten said: 'This document gives ­people the right to shop around for asylum and hedge their bets on getting into one country or another.

“If they are genuine asylum seekers, the Netherlands would be as good as the UK.“It’s obvious they think they can get the most out of the UK and that is why they came here.”

The Home Office declined to comment as some of the cases are ongoing.
