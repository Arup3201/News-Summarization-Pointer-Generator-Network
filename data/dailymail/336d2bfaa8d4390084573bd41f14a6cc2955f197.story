A woman whose iPhone went missing on a Disney Cruise was able to catch the alleged thief after photos he took with her phone began popping up in her ‘cloud’ – the feature that stores and syncs all personal documents.

Katy McCaffrey, who went on the cruise last month, began noticing that photos started to pop up in her iCloud account.

Included in those photos were pictures of her alleged iPhone thief on the cruise ship, viewing the sunset, going to parties, and drinking with other crew members.

Caught red handed: A woman was able to identify her phone's alleged thief after the photos he took popped up in her Photostream

Posed: Katy McCaffrey identified the thief as 'Nelson,' part of Disney Wonder's crew

Dislike: McCaffrey posed 20 pictures that Nelson posted, showing the good time he was having with her missing phone

In an effort to reclaim her phone, Ms McCaffrey created an album on Facebook entitled ‘Stolen iPhone Adventures.’ 

It shows 20 pictures of a man she calls ‘Nelson’ taking advantage of her phone aboard the Disney Wonder, nymag.com’s Daily Intel blog originally reported.

The disgruntled cruise-goer was able to see the pictures because of an Apple feature called Photostream, which automatically uploads all photos taken with the iPhone to their iCloud account.

Nelson, it seems, was too busy having a good time to check whether or not Photostream was activated.

The feature can be turned off with a simple on/off switch in the phone’s settings.

Guy's night: Nelson (blue shirt, right) took snaps of himself having a boys night with some friends

Gal pal: McCaffrey identified this woman as Nelson's girlfriend, who also appears to be pregnant

Angry and happy: He posted several pictures of his assumed girlfriend in an Angry Birds T-shirt, displaying a breadth of emotions

Raise your glass: He is seen enjoying a cuppa with another crew member

Photos Nelson took document Nelson’s adventures on the cruise ship. In the first picture, he’s posing on the deck in front of a beautiful ocean sunset.

Ms McCaffrey writes: ‘This is Nelson. Nelson has stolen my iPhone.’

She was able to identify him by a clearly placed name tag below the left lapel of his shirt as he was pictured with character actors.

In later pictures, Nelson takes snapshots of his pregnant girlfriend, assumedly another Disney Cruise employee. 

Many of them show Nelson out drinking with friends (‘gosh they look a cool group of folks’) and the boat’s captain at a gathering with drinks and cake (‘sure looks like they had a swell time.’)

Ms McCaffrey did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment.

Letting loose: Nelson also went to what appears to be a staff birthday party, with the ship's captain (far right) in attendance, she said

Bitter: McCaffrey wrote, 'And here's a beautiful sunset Nelson had time to capture, all on my stolen iPhone'

Cruise-tivities: Nelson's interests were varied, and included snapping a picture of another crew member, and one with a parrot statue

Rebecca Peddie, the Manager of Public Affairs at Disney Cruise Lines, told MailOnline that the crew member in question has been placed on administrative leave.

She said: ‘We take these matters very seriously. We have a zero tolerance policy for this type of behaviour,' adding that the phone has been recovered and will be returned to its owner as soon as the Wonder returns to port.

Ms Peddie said that the crew member on administrative leave is currently on-board the ship, which is currently on an Alaskan itinerary.

She continued: ‘We recovered the phone and we’ve been in touch with the guest,’ adding that she and Ms McCaffrey are working out terms.

A Disney spokesperson told the newspaper that they found out about the Facebook album and the alleged theft.

Meanwhile, the crew member suspect is still on the Wonder, but has been restricted from entering guest areas of the ship.

Daily Intel notes that there could be a large margin of error for the employee’s culpability, including whether or not Ms McCaffrey reported the device missing or if he somehow purchased the phone from another person without knowing the original source.
