Wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay's former mistress,Toni McHugh, has revealed how terrified she now is of the man she thought she was going to marry and once loved 'unconditionally'.

Ms McHugh was having an affair with real estate agent Baden-Clay when he killed his wife Allison on 19th April 2012.

She appeared on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday night to make it clear that Baden-Clay didn’t kill his wife Allison for her.

‘I loved him already he didn’t need to, he already had me – he killed for himself,’ she said.

In an emotional interview with 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown, Ms McHugh broke down as she explained: ‘I want this man to never, ever, ever enter my life ever again.’

Gerard Baden-Clay's mistress, Toni McHugh, has revealed how terrified she is of the man she once loved 'unconditionally'

Ms McHugh broke down as she spoke about her relationship with the wife killer. She said the pair had planned to get married once he left his wife Allison

She added that she is ‘genuinely fearful’ that she was involved with a man who was not who he said he was.

‘That worries me and that terrifies me,’ she said.

Ms McHugh appeared on the Channel Nine documentary, which detailed the tragic murder of mother-of-three Allison, to tell her side of the story after she was a key prosecution witness at Baden-Clay’s trial. 

'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future,' she told the show.

'He had told me that he would marry me one day.'

Ms McHugh said she loved the convicted murderer 'very much' and wanted to be Mrs Baden-Clay.

Allison Baden-Clay was the mother of three young daughters

'I don't like to use that word "unconditional" anymore but I did love him unconditionally.

'And I was very forgiving, too forgiving.'

The three-and-a-half year affair between Baden-Clay, 43, and Ms McHugh commenced in August 2008.

When asked if she thought the real estate agent killed his wife, Ms McHugh said: ‘I don’t think he’s innocent’.

Ms McHugh said she was devastated when she first heard Alison was missing.

'I never ever wanted harm to her… I didn’t intentionally go out to hurt Allison or her family. I honestly believed it [their affair] was going to be handled properly,' she said.

The 60 Minutes programme also gave an insight into the incredible police investigation that helped secure Baden-Clay’s conviction.

Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, who led the investigation, said Baden-Clay is ‘a guy I wouldn’t trust to take my dog for a walk’.

The morning after he killed his wife and dumped her body by Kholo Creek, about 13k from their Brisbane home, a calm Baden-Clay called 000 at 7.15am to report his wife as missing.

'My wife isn’t home, um and um, I don’t know where she is,’ he said on the phone.

Allison's friends said they immediately suspected him of harming her when they heard she was missing, and claimed they never liked him.

He told police that the two scratches on his face were from shaving and that the scratches on his body came from a caterpillar, while the cut on his hand came from changing a light-bulb.

The program obtained 'chilling' footage of Baden-Clay laughing and saying 'everything is going to be alright', to the person behind the camera

Sergeant Andrew Jackson was called over to the house after Baden-Clay reported Allison missing. He told 60 Minutes: ‘I knew that they weren’t shaving scratches… they were definitely fingernail scratches.’

He added: ‘It looked like someone had cleaned the house before we arrived.’

The police were immediately suspicious of Baden-Clay and the way he was behaving, so called in 80 officers to search the local area.

Acting inspector Ewan Taylor was in charge of forensics and found no blood on Baden-Clay's razor to back up his claim that he'd scratched himself shaving - but they did find blood in Allison’s car.

As police hunted for Allison for 11 days, Baden-Clay continued to call his mistress Ms McHugh.

Allison’s badly decomposed body was eventually found by a canoeist.

Allison's best friends Helen Wilson and Nicole Morrison described how they never liked Baden-Clay and immediately suspected he had harmed Allison when they found out she was missing

‘Baden-Clay lived a life of deception and it was all about Gerard,’ Detective Superintendent Ainsworth said.

He added that Allison appeared to have fought for her life as he most likely smothered her.

‘You’ve only got to look at the scratches on the side of his face,’ he said.

Police found leaves knotted in her hair, and all six types of leaves were from the Baden-Clay back yard - not the creek where she was found.

Police believe he dragged her body across their patio before lifting her into the car.

During the 60 Minutes show, Allison's heartbroken best friends Helen Wilson and Nicole Morrison said Allison 'lived to be a mother, she adored her girls.’

Allison's mother said her family had been sentenced to a lifetime of grief

Ms Morrison added: 'She had the best laugh, when I stop to think about her I can still hear her laugh.’

They said Baden-Clay was very emotionally cruel and once told her he didn’t love her.

They said he picked at the dinners she made and how she cleaned the house.

But despite this, they explained Allison never considered leaving him and always wanted to fix it and make it better.

Allison's diaries were used as evidence in the trial and they detailed how she continued to love her husband despite his cruelty.

During the murder trial, the court heard evidence that Baden-Clay attended corporate functions and night time events connected with his real estate business in the company of mistress Ms McHugh rather than his wife Allison.

The 60 Minutes piece included testimony from a witness the jury never heard from, who claimed Baden-Clay called her and asked 'I'm looking for someone to kill my wife.'

The program also obtained 'chilling' footage of Baden-Clay laughing and saying 'everything is going to be alright', to the person behind the camera.

Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face

In court, Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face.

He said Baden-Clay took his wife's body and dumped it at a nearby creek, and then put in place, and persisted in, a deception plan.

Baden-Clay had also invented the idea of a drug overdose as a ruse about what had really happened to Allison, and he'd shown a profound absence of remorse for his crime, Justice Byrne said. He'd gone on to besmirch Allison's memory during the trial.

'You have no criminal history but you are definitely not of good character,' Justice Byrne told Baden-Clay. You took a devoted loving mother from her three girls, blighting their lives.

We finally have justice for Allison. The evidence presented at this trial has proven that Gerard Baden-Clay is responsible for the murder of his wife Allison. It has been a long wait over the last two years. And this result today marks the beginning of our long journey towards healing and finally allowing us to mourn and grieve this beautiful woman.

Today is not a win for our family, for it will not bring our beautiful Allison back. However it is the closure in another chapter of our journey for this family. We have lost Allison and nothing that has happened here today will bring her back. We as a family will grieve her tragic death forever. Her memory is tarnished by the fact that she was taken from us in such horrific circumstances.

We would like to sincerely thank the Queensland Police Service and the officers involved in the investigation, the SES volunteers who searched night and day in all weather, the scientific experts and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who have all worked tirelessly to ensure that we have justice for Allison. We would also like to thank them for their compassion and support over what has been the darkest of days.

We have appreciated your efforts to protect the privacy of Allison's daughters. Our primary concern has always been and remains the physical and emotional wellbeing of Allison's three beautiful girls. We will help them to rebuild their lives and ask for your support, co-operation and privacy in order to do this. We have a long way to go to ensure that they will cope with a future without their mother.

Allison was a kind-hearted, generous woman, a loving wife and devoted mother whose legacy will continue if we all remember that life is precious, and to take the time to be kind, smile at those who pass you by and live for today. We, her family and friends, didn't get a chance to say goodbye but Allison will always remain forever in our hearts.

Thankyou.
