President Barack Obama has preached economic opportunity and equal access to education as cornerstones of the legacy he wants to leave behind. But in the contest to host his presidential library, two public universities that serve needy communities fear the playing field has been tilted against them by a pair of elite, private schools with seemingly endless money.

University of Illinois at Chicago student trustee Danielle Leibowitz says her university has suspected that it's the underdog all along. A key player in her school's bid for the library, Leibowitz said the university wants to team up with a community foundation to build the library in North Lawndale, a blighted, heavily black neighborhood on the West Side.

'If he wants to be consistent with the message he's given throughout his presidency, it really only makes sense to give it to us,' Leibowitz said of Obama. 'To suddenly hand over your legacy to a private institution seems rather hypocritical.'

Brian Schatz said during a recent interview that his state can't compete financially with two others under consideration in New York and Chicago, but 'we bring different assets to the table'

As Obama weighs a decision he'll announce within months, the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago are struggling to offer the upfront resources needed to offset the massive cost of building the library and presidential museum, expected to run close to half a billion dollars. 

The other two schools in the running, Columbia University, located in New York, and the University of Chicago, are both top-10 schools with a combined endowment of more than $15 billion.

The Obamas are expected to raise much — but not all — of the money themselves, so a university's ability to contribute will be a major factor. The Barack Obama Foundation, which is screening proposals and will recommend a winner to Obama, has asked each school in the running for explicit details about what financial and other resources they can bring to bear.

'Look, when it comes to raw fundraising prowess, we're not in a position to compete with New York and Chicago,' Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said during a recent interview in his Honolulu office, overlooking the panoramic, oceanfront site that Hawaii has proposed for the library. 

'We bring different assets to the table. But if the question is who can raise more money, Honolulu's going to come in third,' he added.

In an unusual move this week, the Obama foundation let it be known that it was displeased with Chicago's proposals.

The University of Chicago, a private school near Obama's South Side home, has long been perceived as a front-runner due to its close ties to the Obamas. 

But the three sites the university has proposed are on Chicago Park District land, and the university can't prove it could secure the land if it was selected, the person said. 

Still, the blunt warning through the media appeared designed mainly to light a fire under the university to fill holes in its proposal, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office quickly stepped in to say the city was working to acquire the land for the library's use.

'The mayor is committed to bringing the library home to Chicago, and we continue to work with the foundation to ensure all Chicago bids remain competitive,' said David Spielfogel, the mayor's senior adviser. 

Although the park district's board president, Bryan Traubert, is married to Obama's longtime friend and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Traubert has recused himself. 

Other attempts to build on park land have drawn consternation from groups like Friends of the Parks. The group sued to block Star Wars creator George Lucas from building a museum on park acreage. 

One potential option could be for city to acquire the land from the park district if Chicago is picked for the library. The city could return the property to the park system if another bid is selected. 

Spielfogel said all options were being considered but that Emanuel will 'only consider potential sites that ensure park land remains under public control and that the surrounding communities have a say in the process.'

Chicago's other proposal, from the public University of Illinois at Chicago, was also met with scrutiny by Obama's foundation. The board of directors raised questions about how changes in leadership will affect the school's future, the person said. 

The campus and University of Illinois system are expected to have a new president, chancellor and board chairman within the next year. The person wasn't authorized to comment publicly and demanded anonymity to the Associated Press. 

The University of Illinois said that Obama's foundation 'should feel confident in the university leadership's ongoing support,' adding that the incoming Illinois governor will fill vacant trustee slots in January. 

The University of Chicago declined to comment for AP's report.

The Obama foundation said each school has its own unique strengths and regardless of which school is chosen, the foundation will be able to raise the needed money.

'The foundation is looking at each response as a complete package and will choose a partner which, on balance, offers the best opportunity to create an outstanding presidential library and museum,' the foundation said in a statement.

As public, taxpayer-funded institutions, the University of Illinois and the University of Hawaii face legal and practical limitations on how much they can contribute to a project such as Obama's library. 

Nevertheless, both schools have sought to show they're eager to do what they can. Hawaii lawmakers have expressed interest in having the state pitch in, while the foundation partnering with the University of Illinois has pledged $5 million. 

Obama was born in Hawaii and started his family and political career in Illinois. He went to college in New York.

Columbia and the University of Chicago have been coy about what they're offering. But people familiar with those schools' proposals, who weren't authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity, said both schools are prepared to absorb a substantial chunk of the cost themselves. They're also working to secure attractive real estate where the library can be built.

Although the foundation has tapped Julianna Smoot, a major Democratic fundraiser and former Obama campaign official, to direct fundraising, the foundation's board has said it won't start seriously raising money to build the library until much later. The Obamas have pledged not to solicit donations until after they leave office, even though they will select a site early in 2015.

Meantime, the question of what message Obama wants his library to convey has grown more pronounced as the economic recovery continues to leave many behind. 

Marcus Betts, a spokesman for the North Lawndale Presidential Library Committee, said Obama has a rare opportunity to show that one's background need not predetermine one's ability to succeed.

'If you think about what Martin Luther King Jr. would do, where he would put a project like this, I think the answer becomes very clear,' Betts said. 'It really boils down to the have and the have-nots.'
