Prince Charles is 'extremely angry' that a convicted sex offender was allowed to stand alongside the Queen on the Royal Barge during the Jubilee celebrations.

MPs have demanded an investigation after Harbinder Singh Rana was invited on the vessel - despite being jailed for four years for assaulting ten women in their homes while posing as a doctor.

The 52-year-old – who was invited by Prince Charles in recognition of  his position as a 'leading member of  the Sikh community' – was pictured on the Spirit of Chartwell during Sunday's Jubilee River Thames Pageant, standing near Prince Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William.

At times, the father-of-three was just feet away from the Queen.

Last night, as MPs demanded an 
inquiry into the security blunder, the policeman who led the 
investigation into Rana's crimes in the mid-1980s described him as a 
'con merchant'.

He pointed out that at least two 
newspaper articles relating to Rana's case could be found on the 
internet using a simple Google search – suggesting even basic checks on 
his background had not been carried out.

He has been banned from all future events involving the royal family after the sex offender was exposed.

An insider told the Daily Mirror that Prince Charles wanted to know how the offender was able to get so close to him.

'Understandably, Charles is extremely angry that he has been put in a position where he has had close contact with a convicted sex offender on more than a few occasions,' they said.

'He is determined to know how such a situation could have arisen. There is no question that had he known about Rana's criminal record, he would never have been invited on the Royal Barge.

'But he also wants to know why this information has not been made available to him in the past as he has met Rana at least five times since 1999.'

Bartholomew Leigh, 76, a retired detective sergeant, said: 'It's obviously bad security.

'This man was a con merchant who was 
convicted of a number of serious crimes on several victims. If he is 
capable of posing as a doctor to molest young women in their own homes 
it makes you wonder what else he could be capable of.

'It is a terrible lack of security to 
let a man like that sail on the Queen's boat. Something has gone 
radically wrong somewhere.'

At the time of the offences, Rana was a
26-year-old researcher working in the social services department of 
Wolverhampton Council. He targeted ten women – one of whom was pregnant –
after finding their details stored at work.

Posing as a doctor, 
complete with medical bag, bottles and needles, he bluffed his way into 
his victims' homes, claiming he needed to carry out intimate 
examinations.

In one incident he posed as a 
psychiatrist and injected a woman in the buttocks. Rana, who was senior 
vice-president of the 30,000-strong International Sikh Youth Federation 
at the time, was convicted at Dudley Crown Court of 11 assaults, five 
indecent assaults and an attempted assault.

Yesterday there was no sign of Rana or
his wife Parkash, 50, at their detached home in Walsall, West Midlands.
But it was reported yesterday he had been invited to attend the 
flotilla by Prince Charles's office three weeks ago.

Asked whether he had been vetted, Rana said: 'I don't know what checks they do or how they do them.'

The revealation will raise questions about why apparently no checks were carried out on Mr Rana's background before he was allowed to be photographed within inches of senior royals

He added that he had never been asked 
about his sex crimes before the event. And he insisted he had not spoken
to any royals on the boat, and claimed his 1986 conviction was the 
result of 'mistaken identity'. Steve McCabe, MP for Birmingham Selly 
Oak, who sits on the Home Affairs select committee, said last night: 'It
is an astonishing situation in terms of security. I'm flabbergasted.

'There should be a police 
investigation into how this was allowed to happen. I would like to know 
who thought that he was an appropriate guest for an event involving so 
many women.'

A management consultant by trade, Rana
is thought to have  met the Prince of Wales more than a decade ago 
through the Anglo-Sikh Heritage Trail. The Lottery-funded group is 
supported by England cricketer Monty Panesar and seeks to promote the 
Sikh community.

On the group's Facebook page, Rana is 
described as being a  'close friend' of the Prince. In 2006 he acted as 
Charles's guide on his tour of the Punjab.

Dr Kate Cook, from Manchester-based 
Trafford Rape Crisis, said it was 'extremely disappointing someone like 
him (Rana) has been allowed to mingle at such a high-profile and 
prestigious event'.

'Imagine how horrified you would be if you saw your attacker standing by the Queen,' she added.

A spokesman for Clarence House confirmed that the Prince had no knowledge of Rana's sex crimes.

Both Clarence House and Scotland Yard refused to comment on royal security procedures.

Rana is understood to have been accompanied on the boat by his 22-year-old daughter Kamalpreet.

It is not the first time that Rana's convictions have come back to haunt him.

A decade ago, the Sikh Secretariat 
group complained to Government ministers over the decision to appoint 
him to the Inner Cities Religious Council, which advised the Government 
on religious issues in the community.
