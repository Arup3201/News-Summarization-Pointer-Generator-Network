The U.S. may not leave any troops in Afghanistan after December 2014, a White House official has said.

The indications made by the Obama 
administration yesterday defies the Pentagon's view that thousands of 
troops may be needed to keep a lid on al-Qaeda and to strengthen Afghan 
forces.

The end of 2014 marks the deadline for withdrawal of NATO combat troop, a process which began in November 2010.

No promises: U.S. President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, pictured last year, will meet on Friday as the White House gave the first signal that it might leave no troops in Afghanistan after 2014

Should the US pull all American troops out of Afghanistan at the end of 2014?

Previously no explicit signals have been made by the U.S. regarding what future missions in Afghanistan will be necessary and how many American troops they would require.

The U.S. now has 66,000 troops in Afghanistan, down from a peak of about 100,000 as recently as 2010.

‘The U.S. does not have an inherent 
objective of `X' number of troops in Afghanistan,’ said Ben Rhodes, a 
White House deputy national security adviser.

‘We have an objective of 
making sure there is no safe haven for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and 
making sure that the Afghan government has a security force that is 
sufficient to ensure the stability of the Afghan government.’ 

At stake is the risk of Afghanistan's collapse and a return to the chaos of the 1990s that enabled the Taliban to seize power and provide a haven for Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.

Fewer than 100 al-Qaeda fighters are believed to remain in Afghanistan, although a larger number are just across the border in Pakistani sanctuaries.

The force: The U.S. currently has 66,000 troops in Afghanistan and may withdraw all withing the next 24 months

Remain: Afghan National Army troops on their graduation at a NATO training unit, which Pentagon believes require U.S. and NATO ally troops if it is to continue

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has 
said he foresees a need for a U.S. counterterrorism force in Afghanistan
 beyond 2014, plus a contingent to train Afghan forces.

He is believed 
to favor an option that would keep about 9,000 troops in the country.

Administration
 officials in recent days have said they are considering a range of 
options for a residual U.S. troop presence of as few as 3,000 and as 
many as 15,000, with the number linked to a specific set of 
military-related missions like hunting down terrorists.

Asked in a conference call with 
reporters whether zero was now an option, Rhodes said, ‘That would be an
 option we would consider.’

His
 statement could be interpreted as part of an administration negotiating
 strategy.

On Friday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is scheduled to meet
 President Barack Obama at the White House to discuss ways of framing an
 enduring partnership beyond 2014.

The two are at odds on numerous issues, including a U.S. demand that any American troops who would remain in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends be granted immunity from prosecution under Afghan law.

Karzai has resisted, while emphasizing his need for large-scale U.S. support to maintain an effective security force after 2014.

In announcing last month in Kabul that he had accepted Obama's invitation to visit this week, Karzai made plain his objectives.

‘Give us a good army, a good air force
 and a capability to project Afghan interests in the region,’ Karzai 
said, and he would gladly reciprocate by easing the path to legal 
immunity for U.S. troops.

Karzai is scheduled to meet Thursday 
with Panetta at the Pentagon and with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham 
Clinton at the State Department.

Without explicitly mentioning immunity
 for U.S. troops, Obama's top White House military adviser on 
Afghanistan, Doug Lute, told reporters Tuesday that the Afghans will 
have to give the U.S. certain ‘authorities’ if it wants U.S. troops to 
remain.

‘As we know from our Iraq experience,
 if there are no authorities granted by the sovereign state, then 
there's not room for a follow-on U.S. military mission,’ Lute said.

He 
was referring to 2011 negotiations with Iraq that ended with no 
agreement to grant legal immunity to U.S. troops who would have stayed 
to help train Iraqi forces. As a result, no U.S. troops remain in Iraq.

David Barno, a former commander of 
U.S. forces in Afghanistan and now a senior fellow at the Center for a 
New American Security, wrote earlier this week that vigorous debate has 
been under way inside the administration on a ‘minimalist approach’ for 
post-2014 Afghanistan.

Stay or go: Although NATO have pledged to remove all combat troops from Afghanistan it it yet unknown how many will be required to stay to train local forces and keep Al-Qaeda at bay

In 
an opinion piece for ForeignPolicy.com on Monday, Barno said the ‘zero 
option’ was less than optimal but ‘not necessarily an untenable one.’

Without what he called the 
stabilizing influence of U.S. troops, Barno cautioned that Afghanistan 
could ‘slip back into chaos.’

Rhodes said Obama is focused on two main outcomes in Afghanistan: ensuring that the country does not revert to being the al-Qaeda haven it was prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and getting the government to the point where it can defend itself.

‘That's what guides us, and that's what causes us to look for different potential troop numbers - or not having potential troops in the country,’ Rhodes said.

He predicted that Obama and Karzai would come to no concrete conclusions on international military missions in Afghanistan beyond 2014, and he said it likely would be months before Obama decides how many U.S. troops - if any - he wants to keep there.

Rhodes said Obama remains committed to further reducing the U.S. military presence this year, although the pace of that withdrawal will not be decided for a few months. Last year the U.S. military pulled 23,000 troops out of Afghanistan on Obama's orders.
