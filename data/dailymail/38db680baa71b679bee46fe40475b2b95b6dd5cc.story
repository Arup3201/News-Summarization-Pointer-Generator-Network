While Sam Warburton was watching his beloved Tottenham take on Arsenal at White Hart Lane, Rhys Webb was tearing through the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes on his quad bike.

The morning after last week’s defeat by England was, according to the Wales scrum half, not the time to lock oneself away in the house.

Webb admitted that he faced questions about the result from passers-by and the 26-year-old is determined to provide answers with a backs-to-the-wall performance against Scotland on Sunday afternoon.

‘Everyone is entitled to their opinion,’ said Webb. ‘But I don’t take too much notice. The Welsh public probably think we are no good any more, but there you are. We’ll be back.’ 

The dunes just outside Bridgend have a history with downbeat Welsh rugby players. Adam Jones carried out lone fitness training on ‘The Big Dipper’ - the highest dune in Europe - when he was without a club last summer, while JPR Williams and Steve Ovett also used to run along the sands in a previous era. 

‘I took my quad bike and did a few doughnuts,’ said Webb. ‘I went out and about and I watched my local team play.'

'At the end of the day it is a game; it is a game of rugby. We’ve lost and obviously we’re bitterly disappointed with that, but personally I didn’t want to keep myself in the house, I wanted to get out. You take it on the chin.’ 

If previous results provide any indication, Wales should reverse their fortunes at Murrayfield on Sunday. 

Webb (front) was ultimately on the losing team though as England rallied from behind to win 21-16

They have won their last seven meetings with Scotland, including a 51-3 thrashing at the Millennium Stadium last year. 

The Scots, however, are revitalised under new coach Vern Cotter. There were reasons for optimism after their attacking performance against France last week, while Wales courted criticism for their showing against England. 

Warren Gatland’s players failed to involve their strike runners and the Kiwi will be demanding more initiative on Sunday. 

‘Some of the boys were probably a bit lazy at the weekend; not getting up off the floor quick enough and areas like that,’ said Webb. 

‘We had six or seven guys - forwards - on the deck and international rugby is all about numbers on your feet; trying to create something. I just felt as a nine, and Dan Biggar was the same, that we didn’t have anything to work with.

'Every time we got the ball we seemed to be trying to get out of danger. This week is about not being afraid to shift it and have a go. Focus has been about getting the boys up off the floor and working hard.’ 

Wales were nullified up front and struggled to provide a platform to attack from the set-piece against the English. 

Scotland do not offer the same levels of power in the scrum, however they will look to target Warren Gatland’s side at the line-out. 

Wales training has been at full-throttle at the Vale of Glamorgan and the breakdown is another area to improve. 

‘England had a big pack and we didn’t deal with the threats coming over the ball,’ said Webb. 

‘There was one passage of play where George Ford, who was probably the smallest guy on the pitch, disrupted our ruck when we had a big dent in the phase. 

Webb (centre) is hoping Wales put in a better display when they travel to Scotland in Sunday's match

'He had no licence to slow that down. He should have been cleaned out. It’s about forwards scanning to see whether they need to go to these rucks or whether they can get on their bike and be a threat out wide.’ 

With the World Cup looming, the Welsh game plan will come under more scrutiny if it fails to fire this afternoon. 

But Gatland’s group have a tendency to perform when the chips are down, and Webb is hoping to be stopped for the right reasons on his next trip to Merthyr Mawr. 

‘Everybody is against us having lost to England,’ said Webb. ‘We want to do well not just for ourselves and our families, but for the nation as well. We need to repay our fans this week.’
