It seemed turtle was definitely on the menu when one was cornered by two giant crocodiles.

But, incredibly, instead of becoming lunch it was allowed to bask in the hot South Carolina sun on the back of one of the predators.

The amazing picture was taken by photographer Mac Stone, who had to set up an intricate camera rig to capture the creatures in their natural habitat.

Unlikely alliance: Instead of eating the turtle the alligator allows it to sit on its back as they bask in the river

Mr Stone spent four months in the stifling heat of the Francis Beidler Forest tracking the animals.

But he was unable to get the picture he wanted because the shy creatures would sink into the water when he appeared.

So the photographer built a rig on the log to allow him to catch the animals behaving naturally.

The high-tech camera took a picture every five minutes over two weeks so the alligators and turtles could go undisturbed.

It was only when Mr Stone went through the images that he realised he had caught the rare image.

Mr Stone said: 'I was actually 
nowhere in sight during this photo. I tried for nearly a month to make 
photos of this behaviour but had no luck because the alligators and 
turtles would just slide off into the water anytime I came near.

On the run: The turtle looked in trouble when it was caught on the same log as the alligator in South Carolina

Cornered: The amphibian's escape route is blocked by a second alligator, which do eat turtles in the wild

'So,
I built I custom rig for my camera to mount atop the log and used 
what's called an intervalometer to take a photo every five minutes 
throughout the day for two weeks.

'Every morning, I would paddle out to the log and set up the camera and then return in the evening to retrieve the camera.

'The gators and turtles didn't mind the camera and continued to clamour for space on the prime basking spot in the swamp.

'What
was revealed was an interesting series of photographs that shows how 
gators and turtles interact when prime real estate is limited.'

American alligators can grow up to 11ft and eat a range of animals and fish, including turtles and snakes.
