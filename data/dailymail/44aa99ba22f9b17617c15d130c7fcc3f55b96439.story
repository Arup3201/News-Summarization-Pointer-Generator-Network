A Sydney Kings basketballer has received racist abuse after he sparked outrage among fans when he elbowed a rival player. 

Former NBA star Josh Childress was ejected from the court during a match against the Perth Wildcats on Friday night when he struck Jesse Wagstaff in the face as he lined up for a shot.

Despite  Childress apologising for his actions, which have gone viral, he has been abused on social media.

Both teams have a minor scuffle after Childress' actions which he has described as 'out of character'

'I acted out of character and I apologize (sic). I thank the many fans who have offered their support! It means a lot!!!' Childress tweeted on Sunday. 

Initially, the response from fans was abusive but within the spirit of fans slamming a rival player.

'Shame on u, Find a different team and sport.' Micheal Miller tweeted.

Jason Mills questioned why the 391-game veteran made the career move to Australia.

'Can't hack it in the NBA? Cant' take a screen? Just grow a giant fro thingie and throw elbows in an Aussie basketball league.' 

Sydney Kings star posted this apology on Twitter to his fans, team and the Perth Wildcats

JChillin lashed out at the American star telling Childress that he hopes he gets deported 

But soon comments turned nasty - and even racist.

A Twitter user by the name of JChillin, who has 64,000 followers, did not hold back on his thoughts about the player, labelling him a 'dog', 'thug' and 'dirty player' in his endless offensive rant. 

 'It was a clean screen you a b***... no mo NBA f***'

Get the f*** out of Australia, you have no class. The screen was completely legal. Take it like a man.'

He then went on to say that he hoped Childress was deported back to the U.S.

'Go back to america you big haired r****, we dont want you in Australia anymore, last night was disgusting!" 

The racial taunts continued with JChillin calling him a 'typcical n*****' and suggesting that Childress attacked Wagstaff 'becuz he's white'.

Childress posted a screen grab of the tirade of abuse and simply said: 'But I'm a "thug".'
