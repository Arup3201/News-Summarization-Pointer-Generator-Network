An elderly Canadian couple were trapped in their Lake Erie home for four days after snow engulfed their cottage.

Michael and Janet Wilton found themselves trapped at the start of the month, after record-breaking snowfall in their hometown, Amherstburg.

Fortunately neighbors were able to help free them by using shovels and snow-blowing machines to clear a path to their door.

Snowed in: Banks of snow reached the roof of the couple's lakeside home

Trapped: Janet and Michael Wilton peer out the windows of the home they were stuck in for four days

Banks of snow have been building up around the couple's lakefront cottage since the start of the month, with drifts nearly reaching the roof.

Mrs Wilton, 67, told the Windsor Star she woke one morning to find that they were unable to open their front door.

'We had power, water, food and alcohol -
 not necessarily in that order,' Mrs Wilton said. 'We were quite comfortable,
 but there’s a difference between willingly staying inside and being 
forced to stay inside.'

Her 71-year-old husband was eventually able to clamber out the back door, but Mrs Wilton had to wait until neighbors had cleared a trench.

Although they are no longer trapped, banks of snow still block their windows Mrs Wilton said, adding: 'It's like living in a cave.'

Never-ending task: Michael Wilton, 71, shovels snow by the couple's front door

Blocked: Snow nearly the height of the couple's home has built up in their drive

Because their home is on the banks of Lake Erie there is nothing to block the blizzards sweeping across the large body of water.

'There is no 
resistance, no friction. No trees, no houses, no hills. It’s just a big 
field of ice,' meterologist Marie-Eve Giguere said.

'[The wind] carries the snow … and it just accumulates at the first obstacle it encounters, which are those properties.'

The wind responsible for blocking in the Wiltons' home is forecast to continue until Friday, and the colder than average temperatures are due to remain until March.

Migrate: After being freed from their snow-bound home, Janet Wilton plans to fly to Spain for a vacation

After being trapped for four days however, Mrs Wilton isn't taking any chances and has booked a vacation to Spain.

But her husband is staying behind, saying: 'Somebody has to stay and take care of the cats.'
