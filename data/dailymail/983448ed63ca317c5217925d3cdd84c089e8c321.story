The first memories are cherished ones. For me, it is Liverpool vs Leeds in 1965, the all-red strip against the all whites. The goal-scorers stand out as iconic names: Roger Hunt, Billy Bremner, Ian St John. I’ll never forget that diving header of Ian St John to win the Cup. I would have been seven years old and after the game I was running about in the garden with my friends practising diving headers.

Then there was Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul scoring for Spurs against Chelsea in 1967, the first time my team had made the final. Watching the team you supported winning a Cup for the first time was amazingly exciting. First FA Cup finals are like first loves; you never forget them.

Sometimes we need reminding just how important the FA Cup is to our national game. On Saturday though, Bradford and Middlesbrough did the job for us, as did Cambridge United on Friday night. It is turning into one of the best weekends for the FA Cup for years, which everyone who understands English football will relish.

It has had such an pivotal role in our game. Over my childhood years, the finals are imprinted on my mind. The incredible physicality of that Leeds vs Chelsea final in 1970, the night-time replay at Old Trafford, the long throw and David Webb’s goal; Charlie George’s celebration in 1971; Jim Montgomery’s save in 1973 — ‘better than Gordon Banks,’ according to my uncle, who himself had been a schoolboy keeper on Tottenham’s books.

FA Cup final day was like a bank holiday. In my house, it meant a big family gathering with friends, uncles, aunts and cousins coming round to watch the game. As a child, the excitement would grow throughout the week. It was like waiting for Christmas.

Of course, it had a lot to do with the novelty of the game being on television. That in itself was a cause of excitement. In that week in May there was suddenly a glut of games on live television: the FA Cup final, England vs Scotland a week later and maybe a European final, if an English team had made it.

It’s hard to believe those used to be perhaps the only live games of the season, other than the odd England match. How times have changed. I wouldn’t want to swap what we had then for the comprehensive TV coverage we have now. But it is clear that the rarity of televised football in those days magnified the importance of the FA Cup.

That will never return and the fact that the Premier League is financially a much greater priority is not going to change. The kind of hype which was once reserved for the FA Cup final is now a week-by-week occurrence in Premier League games. I don’t believe there’s one magical reform which could restore the allure of the FA Cup.

Football is a commercial business and the success of the Premier League was evident last week with the release of the list of richest clubs in Europe — all 20 of the Premier League clubs from last season are in the top 40. That demonstrates how strong the domestic product is and the TV money they can command.

However, there is a need for a little balance from managers and players. In my day, winning the Cup was on a par with winning the league. Many fans, players, managers and even chairmen would prefer a glory day at Wembley to winning the league.

I was lucky enough to play in four and win two finals. I remember my first against Manchester City in 1981.

I was a bit frustrated that I was missing all the build up on the TV, because that had been such a part of my life. And when I walked out on to the pitch a couple of hours before kick-off, I was hoping that I was one of the players selected for an interview. I’d watched that day, that build-up and the pre-match interviews so many times as a kid, I just wanted to be a part of it. Fortunately, Bob Wilson, who worked for the BBC, picked me out.

That was one of the iconic finals, with Ricky Villa’s amazing goal in the replay, having played so badly in the first game. When he set off on that famous run, we were all desperate for him to just hit it early, before he lost the ball. Fortunately he ignored us all and created one of the FA Cup’s great moments.

These days you cannot expect the same kind of feelings from players. The FA Cup had become just one hyped game among the hundreds shown on TV. Players who are 20 or 25 now won’t have the same fond memories I had.

But they would do well to reflect on the fact that Ricky is still remembered all around the world for that moment. You can remind players that when they look back on their career, it’s the Cup finals they will want to tell their grandchildren about — not finishing sixth in the Premier League.

Having managed, I understand how difficult it is to balance a squad when the Premier League is your first objective. But equally, as a manager, the pinnacle is to win a trophy. Clearly your job prospects depend on how you do in the league, but for yourself and your own career, winning a cup will be hard to better.

Fans know all this. They are the ones who are usually keener on their club taking the Cup more seriously than anyone else. Portsmouth have sunk right down to League Two and endure a horrendous time financially over recent years. But speak to most Portsmouth fans and the moments they remember, the stories they tell again and again will be about the day they won the FA Cup in 2008 with Harry Redknapp.

You cannot make the FA Cup what it was. Television habits, culture, society and football have all moved on. But you ignore it at your peril. Football is about glory, excitement and winning.

The money came to football because of the romance, not the other way around. People who don’t understand how important the FA Cup is in creating that romance don’t really understand what English football is about.
