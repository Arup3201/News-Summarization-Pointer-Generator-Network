Manuel Neuer will battle Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday night. Here, ADAM SHERGOLD argues why the Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper should be crowned the world's best player. 

I believe that Manuel Neuer should win the Ballon d'Or on Monday night. No wait, do bear with me.

The nomination of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for this world player award was as inevitable as night following day, with the rest challenging for just one place.

And, in my view, it was fitting that Neuer, goalkeeper for Bayern Munich and Germany, should take it following a quite exceptional year that saw him establish himself as the undisputed No 1 of No 1s and conquer the world.

HONOURS

World Cup (Germany); Bundesliga; German Cup (Bayern Munich)

German Footballer of the Year; IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper; UEFA Team of the Year; Champions League Team of the Season; World Cup Golden Glove; World Cup All-Star Team; World Cup Dream Team 

The first thing to reflect on is just how Neuer has come to revolutionise and redefine what it takes to be a goalkeeper.

He has invented the 'sweeper-keeper' role - the man actually redefined the one position in the game of football that is incredibly difficult to redefine.

Neuer not only excels in all the traditional attributes of goalkeeping - he is tall, strong, imposing, brave, intelligent and an outstanding shot stopper with excellent distribution.

But he is also unafraid to roam 30, 40, 50 yards from his line to indulge in that self-taught 'sweeper' role. He snuffs out opposition attacks before they can even be conceived and is just as much an orchestrator of an attack as the defence or midfield.

On occasions when Bayern are in their glorious full flow, pinning opponents back into their defensive third, Neuer can usually be found on the halfway line.

This is probably how all goalkeepers will play in a few years’ time and Neuer will rightly be viewed as a pioneer.

Neuer also enjoyed an exceptional 2013-14 season with Bayern, winning the Bundesliga and the German Cup

The second, and most obvious, point to make is that Neuer won the World Cup in 2014. In the process, he conceded just four goals in seven matches, quite impressive considering how high-scoring the tournament was.

Did Messi win the World Cup? Well, almost, but no cigar. Did Ronaldo win the World Cup? Not even close. Still stuck in the group stage I'm afraid. Might as well have not bothered turning up.

The highlight from Neuer was that one-handed save from France's Karim Benzema in the quarter-final. It was one of the important little vignettes that made up Germany's golden summer. Fearless, defiant, 'you-shall-not-pass' keeping.

Neuer, like the rest of that Germany team, kept his head together under the immense weight of expectation that comes with reaching the latter stages of the World Cup.

No other team at the tournament had the unity, camaraderie and professionalism of the Germans - they were deserved champions and Neuer was worthy winner of the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper.

That World Cup triumph came off the back of another exceptional campaign with Bayern, who won the Bundesliga and the German Cup, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League.

It's the facts and figures that best illustrate Neuer's command for his club. In 2013-14, he kept a remarkable 25 clean sheets for Bayern. This season, he has shut out 13 of their 17 league opponents.

Indeed, in the calendar year of 2014, Neuer conceded just 14 league goals - an astonishing statistic that underlines Bayern's dominance in the German league.

They have set so many new records in the past few months, going so many games undefeated, that they had to pretty much perform an exorcism on the record books.

Sure, Ronaldo won the Champions League in 2014. But I think you’ll find Neuer won it in 2013, thank you very much. Been there, done that and, unlike Ronaldo, kept on the shirt. Messi won nothing over the year, so that should rule him out straight away.

What’s more, goalkeepers are always under-valued and under-appreciated. Goalkeepers never get the glory, they never hog the limelight like Messi or Ronaldo. They’re not prima donnas, they just get on with it.

They have been so vitally important to all successful teams through football history, yet only one has ever won the Ballon d’Or – the great Lev Yashin back in 1963.

And that brings me to my final point. Neuer should win in Zurich for the sake of the Ballon d’Or and for the sake of the game.

Don’t get me wrong, I love both Messi and Ronaldo and love the way they continue to inspire one another to ever-greater heights.

But since 2008, they have locked out first and second place every year except 2010. That year, Andres Iniesta came second and in order to do that he had to score the winning goal in the World Cup final.

Frankly, it’s getting a bit boring. Let’s turn our besotted gaze away from their never-ending game of one-upmanship and celebrate somebody else.

And if, in a year when he won the World Cup, the Double with Bayern and been so frugal in conceding goals to make Ebenezer Scrooge look generous, Neuer doesn't claim the prize there really is no justice.
