The pizza couldn't wait. 

A Kentucky attorney was arrested for drunk driving, and authorities caught her trying to order a pizza at the same time.

Authorities say that Rosanna Heinrichs, 27, had the Domino's Pizza website loaded on her phone's web browser when they pulled her over.

She reportedly admitted to officers that she was looking for a place to order pizza.

Police pulled Heinrichs over after observing her swerve repeatedly in and out of her lane near the corner of Shelbyville Road and Heady Avenue in Louisville at around 2.30am Sunday.

Police say that Heinrichs smelled of alcohol and had glossy eyes when they pulled her over.

She admitted to drinking a beer and half a bottle of wine. 

Heinrichs was taken into custody and charged with 'operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs and a communications device violation.'
