Jamaican sprint superstar Usain Bolt tweeted to deny calling the Commonwealth Games 'a bit s***' on Wednesday morning.

Bolt was reported in The Times to have made the remark outside the athletes' village on Tuesday, also replying 'not really' when asked if he was having fun in Glasgow.

But the six-time Olympic champion responded on his Twitter feed by saying: 'I'm waking up to this nonsense..journalist please don't create lies to make headlines.'

Jamaican Jason Livermore, who finished sixth in the 100m final and won his 200m heat in 20.71secs on Wednesday, said: 'Usain's somewhere in the village. I hope he's having a better time than me!

'But the people in Scotland are very welcoming so I can't complain. There's a nice atmosphere and a nice crowd. I'm enjoying myself.

'The food? Ooof. Have I tried Irn Bru? No.

'It's very cold. Back in Jamaica it's not like this. I need to get me some clothes. It's freezing.'

Bolt's manager Ricky Simms told BBC Sport the remarks attributed to the athlete were 'utter rubbish'.

Simms added: 'The atmosphere in and around the stadiums has been absolutely fantastic and I have absolutely no idea where these quotes have come from.'

In response, The Times said: 'We stand by this story 100 per cent. We have utter confidence in this story.'

Bolt arrived in Glasgow last Saturday morning and, at a press conference in the main press centre, confirmed he would be running the 4 x 100 metres relay heats on Friday as well as in the sprint relay final on Saturday, the final day of athletics competition.

The 27-year-old confirmed he would be staying in the athletes' village but added that he would be spending most of his time in his room.

Asked on Saturday what he expected from Glasgow, he said: 'A lot of rain maybe, seeing a lot of kilts around the place. I didn't come here with expectations, I'm just coming out and trying to see the country. I guess they will try to show me their culture.

'I always stay in the athletes' village, it's always fun to be among the athletes, it makes you relax more.

'I try not to walk around the village too much because I tend to take a lot of pictures. I will stay in my room most of the time.'

Bolt said he was looking forward to seeing the Reggae Girlz, the Jamaican netball team, during his time in Glasgow.

Bolt has yet to race this year after taking time to recover from a foot injury but said he was in 'pretty good shape' and looking forward to getting races under his belt.

He also said he was eager to make his Commonwealth Games debut having missed the Melbourne Games through injury in 2006 and not appearing at the Delhi Games in 2010.

Bolt's decision to compete in Glasgow gave the Games a huge boost with other stars such as Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mark Cavendish not appearing in Glasgow.

But it remains to be seen what kind of reception he receives from the Hampden Park crowd when he competes in the sprint relay heats in the light of his reported remarks.

The three Friday evening heats are timed for 9.35pm, 9.43pm and 9.51pm with the sprint relay final being held at 2115 on Saturday night, wrapping up the athletics programme.
