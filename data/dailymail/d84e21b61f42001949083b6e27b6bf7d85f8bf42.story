She's known and loved for her thrifty approach to dressing and the Duchess of Cambridge kept up her recycling reputation on tour in Australia today by wearing not one, but two dresses we've seen before.

First up this morning, Kate ditched the bright hues she has so far worn Down Under, and instead opted for a gorgeous light coffee coloured dress by London-based Serbian fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic as she touched down at Ayers Rock airport, in the Northern Territory.

And it's not the first time the Duchess has worn a shift dress in this style - we've seen her in a strikingly similar number by the same designer twice before.

We've seen that before, too! The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge later headed to Ayers Rock, where Kate wore a £35 Hobbs dress that she purchased in 2012

Deja vuz: Kate first wore the £35 ensemble in July 2012 as she, Harry and William attended the launch of a project in South-East London that aims to train the next generation of sports coaches - she even wore the same wedges 

She first sported a stunning dove grey version of the gown, which reportedly retails for more than £595, in LA on her inaugural tour of America in July 2011, just three months after her wedding to William. 

She
 wore the elegant, knee-length dress again in July 2012 at the Creative 
Industries reception at the Royal Academy of Arts in London’s 
Piccadilly, where she met with David Cameron.

And
 heading for desert terrain and 31c to visit the scared Aboriginal site 
of Uluru, Kate chose a light brown version of the frock today and looked
 immaculate teaming it with patent nude heels.

Later in the day, Kate looked the picture of summer in a patterned white and beige Hobbs dress, as she took a walk down Kuniya Walk at the base of Uluru in Ayers Rock with husband William.

Kate snapped up the appropriately named 'Wessex' dress, which cost £35, in the sale from High
Street store Hobbs back in 2012.

She first wore the ensemble while
 trying her hand at some table tennis and football in July 2012 as she, 
Harry and William attended the launch of a project in
 South-East London that aims to train the next generation of sports 
coaches.

She even opted for the same beige platform shoes, a footwear 
style she covets, and re-wore the £85 Imperia Simple Slingback Espadrille Wedge from Dune - she has the same style in navy blue, too.

Simple: The Duchess of Cambridge looked sophisticated in a light coffee colour as she arrived at Ayers Rock airport with the Duke

Double take: Kate - who is famous for recycling outfits - wore a very similar dove grey dress in 2011 in Beverly Hills, LA and in 2012 in London

Touch down: The Royal couple appeared to match their hues once again as they arrived in Uluru

Hot: The pair were met with a very warm 31C as the landed in central Australia and Will appeared to squint from the sunshine

Picture perfect: Later in the day, the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge posed for a snap with Uluru in the background during the 
sixteenth day of their official tour to New Zealand and Australia

She loves that dress! The Duchess of Cambridge looks radiant as she poses in front of the Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, in her thrifty dress with Prince William today

As for her husband, Will's cream and beige desert ensemble wasn't quite as bold as the real safari garb his father Prince Charles wore when visiting Uluru 31 years ago in March 1983 with Princess Diana.

It is not only the third time Kate has chosen to wear a dress in this style, it is also the second time she has worn a dress by designer Roksanda Ilincic during this Royal tour.

The 
32-year-old previously wore a bright maize yellow wool crepe dress with 
feature white panels by the designer on her arrival in Sydney.

Royalty
 of the genuine, political and Hollywood variety have all demonstrated 
their fondness for Roksanda's idiosyncratic and ever-elegant creations.

Princess
 Beatrice, Samantha Cameron, Michelle Obama and Tilda Swinton are just 
some of the sartorially clued-up women to appreciate her bold 
colour-blocking and clean, unfussy lines.

This isn't the first time that Kate has recycled an outfit during her tour. As she took part in a friendly 
race in America's Cup sailing boats on Auckland's Waitemata Harbour last week, she wore a look we've seen not once, but 
twice before.

The
 Duchess donned blue J Brand skinny jeans and a £48 ME + EM striped 
Breton-style top with a £79.99 navy Zara jacket and cool Ray Ban 
sunglasses.

Kate was seen wearing the exact same 
look at an event at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in East London in 
her role as patron of the charity SportsAid last October, where she 
showed off her toned stomach following the birth of Prince George.

Avid fans will notice that Kate,
who is well known for recycling her wardrobe staples, wore a very 
similar navy outfit at the 2012 Olympics Games when she paid a visit to 
the athletes in the Olympic village, too.

Today the Duchess left her long brunette hair down for her visit to Uluru, one of the most romantic places in Australia.

And she accessorised her simple yet sophisticated look with a small cream clutch bag and dangle drop earrings.

WIlliam and Kate arrived at the landmark - also known as Ayers Rock - exactly a week before their third wedding anniversary.

Glossy: Kate's brown hair shone in the sunshine as she clutched a small nude bag

Smiles: William and Kate giggle as the Duke holds an Aboriginal spear at the National Indigenous Training Academy

Special place: Princess Diana and Prince Charles also visited Uluru, 31 years ago in March 1983

Favourite: Kate previously wore a yellow Roksanda Ilincic when she arrived in Sydney

They then took a late afternoon stroll around one of the largest and most sacred sites in the world.

Taking a walk around Uluru as it glows red in the afternoon sun is a magical experience and William and Kate had the time for a leisurely look around the base of the rock which rises 348m from the desert floor.

The red centre of Australia has turned on a show of green with blooming wildflowers for the royal couple, following recent rains.

Due to its size - Uluru or Ayers rock is 9.4km around the base - the Duke and Duchess will only be able to take in part of it, just as Prince William's parents did 31 years ago, although William and Kate are not expected to climb the rock as Charles and Diana Did.

Glowing: William and Kate will get to experience Uluru's magical red colour

Instead they saw ancient rock paintings, a sacred waterhole and met the traditional custodians, the Anangu people, and the Duchess was told about the special 'women's place' at the rock's base by respected elder and famous tribal tracker, Barbara Nipper Tjikatu.

Barbara had a special gift of paintings on paper made out of wallaby poo droppings to give to the Duchess.

Prince William and Kate are seeing Uluru at the most beautiful time of year, when many people come to celebrate anniversaries, propose marriage or just enjoy a glass of champagne in the car park which has a panoramic view of Uluru at the spectacular moment of early evening glory when the sunsets and its red glow peaks.

After night fall there is a magnificent blanket of stars overhead, the Milky Way even more visible in the desert away from city lights.

William and Kate are expected to spend the evening out in the desert at the luxury camping resort Longitude 101, where they will retire into a cosy and glamorous 'tent' room as the temperature outside drops into the teens.

'It is the most remote place on earth the royal couple will have ever been,' said Ayers Rock Resort communications director, Karena Noble, 'people do come here specially for wedding anniversaries and other meaningful dates.

'Wouldn't it be nice if a baby was conceived here? It really is a special place.'
