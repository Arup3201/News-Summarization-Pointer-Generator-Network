David Cameron today announced an additional £52 million in UK aid for victims of the civil war in Syria, as the G20 summit in St Petersburg saw stark division over the international response to allegations of chemical weapons use by the regime of President Bashar Assad.

The US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security Council approval would be illegal.

Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta - who also attended this morning's aid meeting - said in a tweet last night that 'the G20 has just now finished the dinner session, at which the divisions about Syria were confirmed'.

A spokesman for the Russian presidency said a US strike on Syria would 'drive another nail into the coffin of international law'.

Much of the new money will go towards
medical training and equipment to help civilians targeted by chemical 
attacks, while Mr Cameron also called for international action to secure
humanitarian access to war zones.

After
defeat in the House of Commons prevented Mr Cameron from joining US 
President Barack Obama in preparing for military action against Assad, 
the Prime Minister has sought to avoid being marginalised at St 
Petersburg by putting himself at the head of a drive to persuade G20 
leaders to strengthen their support for efforts to relieve the suffering
of millions of Syrians affected by the two-year civil war.

The PM was yesterday forced to deny he was being sidelined, after reports that a senior aide to summit host Vladimir Putin - a long-time ally of Assad who has warned that military action without UN backing would amount to an act of aggression - had dismissed Britain as 'just a small island: no-one pays any attention to them'.

The PM was yesterday forced to deny he was being sidelined, after reports that a senior aide to summit host Vladimir Putin - a long-time ally of Assad who has warned that military action without UN backing would amount to an act of aggression - had dismissed Britain as 'just a small island: no-one pays any attention to them'

Downing Street demanded 'clarification' of the remarks, which were denied by the Russian President's chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said they did not reflect Moscow's true view of the UK and the 'positive dynamics' of relations between the two countries.

A Number 10 source said that the reported remark 'highlights how a small island with great people can achieve a big footprint in the world'.

It is not known whether the alleged snub
was discussed in a 35-minute bilateral meeting between Mr Cameron and 
Mr Putin which took place at 2am St Petersburg time, after the Russian 
President had treated his guests to a lavish display of music and 
fireworks at the Peterhof Palace.

Mr Cameron announced Britain's new aid contribution - bringing the total UK funding for assistance in Syria and neighbouring states to £400 million - at a meeting he called to urge fellow leaders to dig deep to fund a 3 billion US dollar (£1.9 billion) shortfall in the United Nations appeal for Syria.

Acknowledging the deep disagreements voiced when Syria was discussed at last night's official dinner, Mr Cameron said that action on aid would show that the G20 had 'a very large message' of support for the people of the war-torn Middle Eastern state.

'This is a moral imperative,' Mr Cameron
told the meeting, attended by ministers from Canada, Japan, Australia, 
Saudi Arabia and Turkey and a senior official in the Obama 
administration, as well as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the EU's
Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman van Rompuy.

'This is the big refugee crisis of 
our time. As the Secretary General has made clear, seven million people 
are in dire need and chemical weapons attacks have made this even more 
acute.

'A Syrian 
becomes a refugee every 15 seconds while we sit here at this conference.
That is 5,000 fleeing their homes and becoming homeless while we are at
this G20 summit.

'It 
is also a political imperative. It will help us build international 
support for action by showing that our response is not just military. At
a summit where people have focused on potential divisions over Syria, I
wanted to bring you together to identify key priorities about the 
action needed to send a strong message about our commitment to the 
Syrian people and the urgent priority to do more.'

Reminding fellow leaders that the UN 
relief appeal is so far only 43 per cent funded, Mr Cameron said: 'The 
UK is the second largest bilateral donor and today we can announce an 
extra 81 million dollars... We would welcome an announcement by others 
to highlight our resolve to do more.'

Mr
Cameron said he wanted today's meeting to begin a campaign in the weeks
ahead of the UN General Assembly to challenge the world to meet the 
UN's funding appeal.

He
added: 'On chemical weapons, a strong response must be about saving 
lives as well as preventing future attacks. Britain's new support will 
include scaling up medical response in the face of chemical attacks, 
through the training of medical and civil defence teams, protective 
equipment to assist decontamination and medical supplies including 
antidotes and response medicine.

'I
hope we can send a strong signal that we can act, and act specifically 
to relieve this appalling suffering caused by the war crime of chemical 
weapons use.'

Mr Cameron also called for a 
'political and diplomatic breakthrough on the problem of humanitarian 
access', calling for agreement on the need for 'unfettered humanitarian 
access inside Syria'.

This
could include priority routes for aid convoys, humanitarian pauses in 
the fighting so aid can get through, dedicated officials to resolve 
problems on the ground and the lifting of bureaucratic obstacles for aid
workers.

'All of this will make a big difference to the humanitarian aid picture in Syria,' he said.'If
we can agree these three points, we will have made sure that this G20 
summit - despite all the disagreements there were last night - has a 
very large message on humanitarian aid.'

The
US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have 
backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia 
and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security 
Council approval would be illegal.

Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta -
who also attended this morning's aid meeting - said in a tweet last 
night that 'the G20 has just now finished the dinner session, at which 
the divisions about Syria were confirmed'.

US
frustrations over Russia's stance were reflected in comments by the 
American envoy to the UN, Samantha Power, who told a New York news 
conference: 'Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the 
international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to 
hold the (Security) Council hostage and shirk its international 
responsibilities.

'What
we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the 
Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the 
Security Council we have.'

The Pentagon has been instructed by Obama to draw up a more extensive list of potential targets in Syria, according to the New York Times.

This means expanding beyond the 50 or so 
major sites that were part of the original target list developed with France. 

The newspaper reported that he gave 
the instruction following intelligence indicating that Assad has been 
moving troops and equipment used for chemical weapons.

The aim would not be to strike the chemical weapons instead headquarters overseeing efforts, military units and rockets.

The
US Government accuses Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a 
poison-gas attack in a suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus, on August
21.

Britain announced yesterday that scientists at the Porton Down research laboratories have found traces of the nerve gas sarin on cloth and soil samples retrieved from the site of the attack.

Meanwhile, there were signs that Mr Obama may struggle to secure support in Congress for his proposal of 'limited and proportionate' military action against Assad.

A poll commissioned by the BBC and ABC News suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action, while a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the President.

The survey found that 226 members of the House of Representatives said they would oppose or were likely to oppose military action, against 45 who were certain or likely to support it and 189 who were undecided or did not respond.

Some 17 members of the Senate were certain or likely to oppose Mr Obama's plans, against 23 certain or likely to back him and 60 whose position was undecided or unknown.
