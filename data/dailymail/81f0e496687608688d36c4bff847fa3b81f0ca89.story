A UPS delivery driver has landed in hot water after being filmed kicking a 'fragile' package containing $12,000 worth of goods.

CCTV footage shows the unidentified employee roughly rolling a large box out of the reception area at East Hills Instruments in Westbury, New York, on Monday afternoon.

Ray Martel, who owns the the power plant instrument supply business, said that he was 'shocked' when he watched the surveillance video and saw the driver 'bowl' the parcel - which contained a delicate pressure gauge - around.

'This guy just basically threw the thing out the door . . . If he needed help, he could have just asked,' he told ABC News.

Martel was sending the instrument, a $12,000 pressure gauge used to measure flow inside pipelines, back to a client.  

It was his receptionist who suggested that he watch its poor handling on tape after she witnessed the incident firsthand.

UPS issued an apology on hearing about the problem, noting that all of its 'drivers are trained to handle every package with care.'
