A Brazilian cameraman covering riots over bus far increases has been left braindead after being hit by an explosive device.

Santiago Andrade, 49, was filming the bloody confrontation near Rio de Janeiro's central station for the Band TV channel when he was hit by the projectile, thought to have been thrown by a protester.

He was pictured bleeding from the head after the dramatic incident on Thursday, which came as protesters furious about a 10-cent hike in bus fare clashed with police.

Mr Andrade was taken to hospital and underwent brain surgery, but was today declared braindead by medics, according to the BBC.

A man, who says he held the explosive but did not throw it, was arrested on Sunday. Police have said they will hold him partly responsible.

A police spokesman said: 'Our main aim is to identify the person who's responsible for setting off the device which hit Santiago'.

The clashes last week saw rioters seized control of Rio's main railway station as police tear gas cannister and stun grenades rained down.

Anarchy: Protesters demonstrated against increases in public transport fares by destroying ticket barriers

For
 several hours members of the passe livre, or free pass, 
movement occupied Central do Brasil, smashed ticket barriers and let 
commuters travel without paying.

It was the latest protest to hit Brazil since last June, when nationwide demonstrations broke out after a sharp police crackdown on a group in Sao Paulo that was marching against an increase in public transportation fares.

That increase was reversed in the face of protesters' pressure.

Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes recently approved a 10-cent increase for bus fares, which came into effect over the weekend.

About
 800 protesters had peacefully gathered in central Rio before 
they started marching to the city's main train station, some holding 
aloft signs condemning the billions of dollars spent to host the World 
Cup, money they want used for better hospitals, schools and 
infrastructure.

Clashes broke out inside the train station after demonstrations began jumping over turnstiles and police used batons and tear gas to disperse members of the Black Block anarchist group.

Police pushed the demonstrators outside and used more tear gas to disperse those gathered, while they hurled rocks at the officers.

Authorities were forced to close the station, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. Some bystanders were made ill by the tear gas, while others fainted.

Standoff: Demonstrators set up makeshift barricades in the street to hold back the police

Thais Jorao, a 22-year-old protester, said that demonstration wasn't simply because of the 10-cent bus fare hike.

'If it was a public transportation fare hike when we had good health services and education, you wouldn't have this many people on the street,' he said.

'On top of this you see spending with the World Cup, things that we really don't need. We want health, education, decent public transportation.'
