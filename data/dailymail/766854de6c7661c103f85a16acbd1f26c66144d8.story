Two hurricanes which hit Mexico have so far claimed the lives of 115 people as rescuers continue to search for 68 feared dead following a huge mudslide. 

The Mexican army's emergency response and rescue team is leading the search for victims of the massive landslide which has wiped out half of the remote coffee-growing village of La Pintada. 

Five bodies were discovered on Sunday including a man found wedged under the collapsed roof of a dirt-filled home.

Lieutenant Carlos Alberto Mendoza, commander of the 16-soldier team, said it is the most daunting situation he has seen in 24 years with the army.

'They are doing unbelievable work, hours and hours for just one body,' he told The Associated Press. 

'No matter how hard the day is, they never get tired of working.'

The twin storms, Manuel and Ingrid, simultaneously pounded both of Mexico's coasts a week ago, leading to huge floods and landslides across a third of the country. 

The official death toll has grown to 115, the Interior Ministry said Sunday night.

President Enrique Pena Nieto toured the devastated village following the landslide which covered at least 40 homes.

He said: 'As of today, there is little hope now that we will find anyone alive.'

Survivors staying at a shelter in Acapulco recounted how a tidal wave of dirt, rocks and trees exploded through the center of town, burying families in their homes and sweeping wooden houses into the bed of the swollen river that winds past the village on its way to the Pacific.

The scene by Sunday was desolate, a ghost town where 50 people still awaited evacuation. 

One man remained to care for abandoned goats, pigs and chickens that seemed disoriented as they roamed about.

When the rains get too hard, the crew has to stop for fear of being buried themselves by another slide, Liuetenant Mendoza said.

Ricardo de La Cruz, national director of Civil Protection, said 'The fundamental problem continues to be the rain.

'It complicates the rescue work not only by putting residents at risk, but the military and support crews as well.'

Pena Nieto told storm survivors that La Pintada would be relocated and rebuilt in a safer location as officials responded to a wave of criticism that negligence and corruption were to blame for the vast devastation caused by two relatively weak storm systems.

He said: 'I will come to inaugurate a new La Pintada. 

'That's a promise I'm making today to this community, which has undergone such a misfortune.'

The government has been critisied however, being blamed for making natural disasters worse because of poor planning, lack of a prevention strategy and corruption.

A spokesman for Mexico's nonprofit Center of Investigation for Development wrote in an online editorial criticising a federal program to improve infrastructure and relocate communities out of dangerous flood zones.

'Governments aren't responsible for the occurrence of severe weather, but they are for the prevention of the effects.

'The National Water Program had good intentions but its execution was at best poor.'

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre publicly confirmed that corruption and political dealings allowed housing to be built in dangerous areas where permits should have been rejected.

Interior Secretary Miguel Osorio Chong said at a news conference earlier in the week: 'The responsibility falls on authorities.  

'In some cases (the building) was in irregular zones, but they still gave the authorization.'

Both the federal and Guerrero state administrations are new and cited cases in the past, though

Osorio Chong said that going forward, he is sure that Aguirre and the mayor of Acapulco will not allow flooded-out victims to return to high-risk areas.

Pena Nieto promised more aid after touring the damage in the northern state of Sinaloa, where Manuel hit as a hurricane last Thursday, affecting 175,000 people.

With record amounts of rain not seen since 1955, Pena Nieto said the national disaster fund would not cover the damage and urged state and local governments to quickly calculate their losses so he could adjust his proposed 2014 federal budget, which he recently submitted to congress.

The storms affected 24 of Mexico's 31 states and 371 municipalities, which are the equivalent of counties. 

More than 58,000 people were evacuated and 43,000 taken to shelters. 

Nearly 1,000 donation centers have been set up around the country, with nearly 700 tons of aid delivered so far. 

Nearly 800,000 people lost power across the country, athough the Federal Electricity Commission said 94 per cent of service had been restored as of Saturday morning.
