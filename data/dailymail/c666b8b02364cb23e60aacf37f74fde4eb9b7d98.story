A high-ranking Army general forced women to have sex with him during combat tours and threatened at least one victim's life, as well as her career and the lives of her relatives if she told anyone about his actions, U.S. Army prosecutors said in a hearing Monday.

Prosecutors allege that Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair committed sex 
crimes against five women including four military subordinates and 
civilian.

Sinclair is facing charges that include forcible sodomy, 
wrongful sexual conduct, violating orders, engaging in inappropriate 
relationships, misusing a government travel charge card, and possessing 
pornography and alcohol while deployed.

Charged: Army Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate relationships with several female subordinates

At the hearing, 
prosecutors alleged that Sinclair committed sex crimes against five women including four military subordinates and 
a civilian. The crimes happened between 2007 and 2012 in 
places including Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany, as well as Fort Bragg 
and Fort Hood in Texas, prosecutors said.

Sinclair was recently flown home from a combat tour to face the charges. The hearing at Fort Bragg is expected 
to last at least two days.Â 

He served as deputy commander in
charge of logistics and support for the division's troops in 
Afghanistan from July 2010 until he was sent home in May because of the 
allegations.

The Army had kept details secret until now in the 
rare criminal case against a high-ranking officer. That is different 
from other high-profile cases where Army prosecutors were quick to 
release charging documents. There have been only two other court-martial
cases against Army generals in recent years.

In one case, prosecutors also said that 
Sinclair threatened one woman's career, as well as her life and the 
lives of her relatives, if she told anyone about his actions.

Sinclair's
attorney asked for the charges to be thrown out, arguing that 
prosecutors had read confidential emails between the general and his 
defense. Defense attorney Lt. Col. Jackie Thompson said this violated 
his client's rights and asked that new prosecutors be brought in to try 
the case.

The hearing officer called a recess until early Monday afternoon to give a legal adviser time to review the documents.
