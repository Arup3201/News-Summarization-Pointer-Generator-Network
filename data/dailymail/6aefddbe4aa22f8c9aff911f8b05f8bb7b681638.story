Chelsea are chasing Hamburg attacking midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu - the man dubbed the next Mesut Ozil.

Jose Mourinho will look to revamp his squad this summer and Calhanoglu is a player interesting the Stamford Bridge hierarchy. 

The Turkey star has been watched 
extensively by Blues scouts this season. He has been a rare bright spark
 in a largely disappointing season for Hamburg and scored a stunning 45-yard free-kick against Borussia Dortmund earlier in the season.

Wanted man: Hakan Calhanoglu is a target for Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho

He has been coveted by a number of European clubs, including Liverpool and Arsenal.

Preliminary
 discussions between Chelsea and Hamburg have taken place and the English club are understood to value Calhanoglu at around £7.5million. However, Hamburg want closer to £12m.

Calhanoglu
 will look to leave Hamburg in the summer and has informed his advisers 
to find him a new club, with UK-based agent Muzzi Ozcan working on a 
deal to bring the 20-year-old to England this summer.

Calhanoglu's impressive displays have drawn comparisons with Arsenal midfielder Ozil, who is also of Turkish descent.
