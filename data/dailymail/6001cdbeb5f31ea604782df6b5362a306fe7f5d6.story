Shameless low-life Frank Gallagher is known for his scrapes with the law.

But this northern reprobate could rival the TV star for brushes with the police - and his looks.

The low-life criminal appears to have modelled his appearance on the fictional slob, even down to his straggly long hair and greying stubble.

But the resemblance did little to help real-life Shameless deadbeat Bernard Moore, who was arrested for trying to gouge out a policeman's eyes during the height of the riots in Manchester on Tuesday evening.

Moore, 45, of Monsall, has been jailed 
for 20 weeks for assaulting a police officer.

His is just one of the faces that represent swift justice as Britain fights back against the rioters who brought terror to our streets.

But the Metropolitan Police believe some of the sentences
 handed out so far to looters are too lenient.

Caught: Bernard Moore being arrested by riot police in a shop doorway in Manchester after trying to gouge a police officer's eyes out

Magistrates' courts in London, Manchester and the West Midlands sat throughout the night to process the huge 
numbers of rioters and looters from four nights of shocking disorder.

Dozens of offenders were behind bars just 24 hours after committing their crimes.

Moore pleaded guilty to using threatening words or 
behaviour likely to cause alarm or distress and assaulting a constable 
in the execution of their duty.

The
 defendant, said to be clearly under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs, shouted abuse at police and attacked PC Joseph Doyle.

The officer told the court in a statement: 'I could feel him scratching at my face trying 
to gouge my eyes out.'

Moore then told the policeman: 'I will come for you when you are asleep.'

District Judge Khalid Qureshi dismissed his claims it was a reckless assault rather than intentional and sent Moore to prison.

He said the victim had been lucky to escape with only a
 small cut to his nose.

Prison vans lined up around the block to deliver the defendants.  

Three
 district judges sat in three courts from about 9pm onwards last
 night in a bid to deal with 117 defendants in custody.

Matters
 were being processed in batches of three defendants being brought up 
from the cells but progress was slow with only six cases held in Court 
16 within two hours.

Biscuit factory worker Owen Flanagan, 28, of Burnage, was sentenced to eight months for stealing £175 worth of clothes others had looted from former 
Oasis singer Liam Gallagher's Pretty Green fashion boutique.

Tom Skinkis was jailed for four months for a public order offence

Jason Ullett was jailed for 10 weeks for a public order offence

Ricky Gemmell, 18, has been detained in youth custody

Aaron Grimmer was jailed for assaulting a police officer

Paul Ruane was jailed for handling stolen goods

Paul Obonyano was jailed for assaulting an officer

The court heard that Ricky Gemmell, 18, of 
Levenshulme, left his call centre job and changed out of his suit before returning to the city to join the riots.

Moments after police officers were pelted with bottles and missiles by a large pack of marauding 
youths, the teenager - who has applied to join the army - began taunting them at Market Street.

David Beswick, 30, of Eccles, ran out of petrol while fleeing with a £400 TV he was handed after Cash Generator was raided.

He was spotted by police officers walking down the street with a fuel can and when they searched his car, the booty was 
recovered. He has been remanded in 
custody after admitting handling stolen goods.

Aaron Grimmer left the trouble in Salford because he heard the
 riots in Manchester 'were better' and has been jailed after assaulting a 
police officer.

The 22-year-old, of Eccles, scraped a 
police officer along the floor as he tried to escape his grip, causing minor injuries.

He grinned
 as he told officers 'I'm here looting'. He has now been jailed for 
four months.

In another Manchester case, a 16-year-old boy admitted trespassing Svarowski
 jewellers in the city centre with a view to stealing.

His mother was in court to hear the 
teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was caught as he 
attempted to flee the shop.

Officers
 on patrol in the area at about 8pm saw the front window smashed and 
groups of people were running into the shop masked and unmasked.

The youth was apprehended and detained in a storeroom.

It emerged he had decided to come into the centre after he received a BlackBerry message saying 'come to town'.

His solicitor said he was awaiting his GCSE results and was hopeful of a college place.

District Judge Qureshi said: 
'The aggravating feature is he has responded to a message. It was 
pre-planned, it was organised. He has then gone there to meet people.

'He
 knew full well what was going on in the country. Somebody from the moon
 would be aware of what has been going on in the country

'I
 am sure looking at the horror on his mum's face when she heard what he 
had done, it will not be a pleasant return home for him.'

BlackBerry
 Messenger featured in another case of a 20-year-old man from Stretford 
who was accused of attempting to break into the Argos store in Stretford
 Mall.

He made no plea and 
was remanded in custody but the court heard it was allegedly an 
organised incident in which he met up with a friend via BlackBerry with a
 view to targeting the shop.

Meanwhile, an 11-year-old girl allegedly involved in the riots on Tuesday in Nottingham has been arrested.

Late night ride: A suspected rioter is taken to the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court in London which ran all night to process the huge number of defendants arrested during the disturbances

Secure: Police officers stand guard at the entrance to Westminster Magistrates' Court, London

She was with a group of people in their late teens and early 20s near Milton Street in the city centre.

She has been charged with criminal damage and attempted criminal damage and remanded into custody.

So
 far 105 people have been arrested in connection with disturbances in 
Nottingham with 46 of them charged with numerous offences.

At 
Westminster Magistrates Court in London, which was tasked with pushing 
through the 371 people who have so far been charged by the Metropolitan 
Police from 888 arrests, the public galleries were full at times despite
 the lateness of the hour.

Almost 100 people appeared overnight, with prosecutors working 5pm to 9am shifts.

About 30 more people charged with offences linked to the rioting are expected to appear before the court today.

The court heard that a graduate who hoped to become a social worker admitted she stole a TV during the rioting in Enfield.

Natasha Reid, 24, from Edmonton, north London, pleaded 
guilty to theft and entering with intent to steal.

She had been on her way to McDonald's when she noticed a 
Comet store had been broken into and helped herself to a £300 JVC television.

Her defence lawyer said Reid handed herself into police because she could not sleep with guilt.

The case was adjourned for sentencing until September 1.

The court also
 heard a 16-year-old rioter hurled a rock at a police car then claimed 
he was a friend of Mark Duggan and told officers: 'You lot should not be
 so trigger happy'

The tearaway told police: 'I knew Mark, he was a friend of the family.' 

Teenager: This young girl was among the people processed by Westminster Magistrates Court overnight

He was eventually caught, hiding his face with a ski mask. 

In East Sussex, a 27-year-old man was remanded in custody after he allegedly encouraged looting on Facebook.

The Hastings Magistrates' Court heard Nathan Sinden posted messages saying: 'Let's start a riot in Hastings. Who is on it?' and 'Looting it is then today. Who is up for shopping?'

He was charged with inciting criminal damage and burglary.

Prosecutor Jeremy King said: 'The messages caused undue fear and anxiety to many people, fearing violence may take place in their home town.'

Two men from Lancashire have also been been charged after posting messages encouraging disorder on Facebook.

Christopher Schofield, 25, of Nelson, and Warren Calvert, 19, of Heysham, were 
charged with intentionally encouraging or assisting in the commission of
 an offence, believing it would be committed.

Both were bailed to appear at a later date.

Standing order: Police officers stand guard as a procession of prison vans arrive at Westminster Magistrates' Court

A 16-year-old boy and
 18-year-old Steven Jones, 16, are to appear at courts in Essex today 
charged with using social networking sites to incite others to commit 
violent disorder.

At Solihull Magistrates' Courts in 
Birmingham, five people were sent to prison overnight while one juvenile
 was bailed with strict conditions, including an electronic curfew, said
 West Midlands Police.

The fast track process was intended to deal with those charged in connection with the disorder in the region.

Chief Superintendent Phil Kay said: 
'This is a first for the West Midlands and has given us the opportunity 
to put before the courts the prisoners involved in the disorder in a 
really timely manner which helps speed up the judicial process.'

A total of 24 prisoners have so far 
been processed there, including 18 adults and six juveniles, the force 
said. The majority have been charged with burglary, violent disorder and
 arson.

The Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Stephen 
Kavanagh, said some of his officers were disappointed with the sentences
 handed out to looters.

He
 told BBC Breakfast: 'That has been personally raised by me and others, 
and the commissioner I know has also raised it, so we will move through 
those issues and I am confident we will get the support of the courts.'

He said the huge policing presence on the streets would continue for another night, and would then be reviewed.

He added that more than 100 arrest warrants were being executed this morning.
