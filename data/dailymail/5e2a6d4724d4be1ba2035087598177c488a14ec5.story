A 19-year-old man has been arrested by police after two suspected 1.2milion-volt stun guns disguised as mobile phones were found in his car.

The alleged weapons are 24 times more powerful than the average police Taser gun and can be fatal if discharged.

They were discovered after officers spotted the teenager in an uninsured Ford Focus in Edgware, North London and decided to search the vehicle.

Danger: The devices, (pictured in this police photo) which look like Nokias, are believed to be K95s and have electrodes in the top

Operated by pressing a button on the side of the device, the weapons can disable victims with a million-volt charge.

The man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a prohibited weapon last Wednesday, and was bailed until September. There was a woman with him but she was not arrested.

The suspected weapons are now being examined by forensic teams to discover what exactly they are.

Anyone found in possession of one of these stun guns in Britain faces up to ten years in jail and an unlimited fine.

In February, police forces across Britain were warned to be aware of a flood of the high-powered stun guns disguised as phones which were being smuggled into the country.

Authorities fear that the stun guns – marketed as personal protection devices – are increasingly becoming the criminals’ weapon of choice, with at least 10,000 estimated to be in circulation on Britain’s streets.

They are also becoming a threat to 
prison guards. A Chinese-made Kelon stun gun – identical to a Sony 
Ericsson K95 mobile phone – was recently found at Low Newton jail, where
the mass murderer Rosemary West is an inmate.

Although illegal in Britain, the stun guns can be bought via the internet for as little as £15.

The
slightest touch against a target is enough to deliver the charge, 
either direct on to skin or through clothing. In extreme cases they may 
cause fatal heart attacks.

UK Border Agency officials have seized the devices at Manchester and Glasgow airports and at a North London postal sorting office, raising fears that they are being imported in growing numbers.

Jail staff say the guns could be used to temporarily paralyse wardens.

A senior prison source said earlier this year: ‘These stun guns pose a dangerous new threat. There are fears they will be smuggled in to aid escapes and intimidate warders.’

The devices are marketed on websites as ‘non-lethal personal security weapons’ for defence against muggers. Claims of up five million volts are advertised for some models.
