A mother-of-four has revealed how her children have helped her cope after she lost her own mother in the most horrific of circumstances.

Lorna Smith, 45, from Shirley, Croydon, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend Clifford Mills, 49, in 2011.

In a premeditated murder plot, he lured her to his flat in Brixton, South London, where he knocked her over the head with a pickaxe handle. He then stabbed her repeatedly and cut her throat, leaving her for dead while he went off to a bar to get drunk using money he stole from her purse.

Her daughter, Louise Harvey, 24, from Islington, North London, was pregnant with her third child when the crime took place.

When she heard her mother had been murdered, she knew exactly who was responsible.

'I was in so much shock. It was like, I know who's done it,' she reveals in the TV show Britain's Darkest Taboos.

She added: 'It made it harder, the fact that I knew who had done it. She must have been terrified to know that she had no chance to fight back because he was so much bigger than her.'

Lorna had been in a relationship with Mills from 2002 and 2006 after splitting up with Louise's father, Peter.

Louise, an only child, had never liked unemployed Mills or the control he exerted over her mother - which increased after he moved in with them. He told her what to wear and watched what she ate, saying he didn't want her to get fat.

Louise explained: 'He'd be the one that worked out how long they spent where and where they were going and how much money they would spend here. It was like she had to go by whatever he wanted to do.'

He had a history of violence as a football hooligan and Louise was alarmed at how he would brag about the fights he had been involved in.

For a time, Mills even came between Louise and her mother, as she moved in with her father as she couldn't stand living with him.

When Louise is 17, Lorna realised she would be better off without Mills and left him. 

Louise was delighted. She said: 'I was so happy and I thought finally she can sort her life out again, she can get rid of him and just start afresh.'

'I just think he is pure evil. He knew what he was doing, he'd planned it all, he's just the devil'

Lorna did try to move on and started internet dating. But unbeknown to her, Mills was not prepared to leave her alone.

He befriended her via a fake Facebook account using the name Charlie Manning. The pair begin to have regular conversations online and he became her confidant.

'Charlie' tells her he is a property developer who wants to treat her like a princess.

Lorna, vulnerable after two failed relationships and keen to find love again, believed him.

'She took it all in too much and she believed every single thing that he was saying. He was telling her that he could give her everything that she had ever wanted, someone that could look after her and I think that's what she had always dreamed of,' Louise said. 'I think it just got to her head too much and she became a bit naÃ¯ve and a bit gullible really.'

Lorna confides in 'Charlie' about Mills and, with his own motives in mind, he advises her to stay in touch with him saying he must still need her as a friend.

Lorna followed his advice and stayed in contact with Mills, cleaning his flat once a week.

However, Louise had suspicions about 'Charlie.'

She said: 'Charlie Manning's profile picture was just a white background with a red love heart, he didn't have any other pictures. He had about three friends, not that many. 

'When she showed me some of the messages that he'd sent, I was reading through them and I kind of looked at her as if to say, do you really believe this? It seems a bit too good to be real.

'I had turned round to my mum and said, are you sure this isn't Cliff talking to you?'

'I miss my mum like you wouldn't believe. I miss talking on the phone to her every day'

Lorna didn't want to believe Charlie could be Mills and carried on chatting to him online. But she was aware their relationship may never go anywhere given they had never met and she didn't even know what he looked like. So when a work colleague asked her out, she said yes.

Louise - who by now was engaged with two children and pregnant with a third - said the new relationship made her mother the happiest she had ever seen her.

She said: 'Even when she was with my dad I don't think Iâ€™d ever seen her glowing as much as she was and it was such a nice atmosphere. She was free in a way.'

Lorna told 'Charlie' about her new relationship and said she wouldn't be able to chat with him online anymore.

Unbeknown to her, Charlie was actually her ex Mills. He was furious on hearing she had moved on with a new man and started putting his terrible plan into action. He searched for weapons online and websites on 'how to kill a human being.'

A month after hearing of her new relationship, Mills invites Lorna to his flat saying he needs some help with some paperwork.

'Pure evil': Clifford Mills is currently serving his life sentence

Lorna still felt sorry for Mills after leaving him and as a kind-hearted woman who always put others before herself, she made the fatal mistake to visit him.

That afternoon, he murdered her in his flat.

He turned himself into the police the next day, saying his alter ego 'Stan' made him do it.

'I just think he is pure evil. He knew what he was doing, he'd planned it all, he's just the devil,' Louise said.

On February 3rd 2012, a year to the day after police found Lorna's body, a jury at the Old Bailey found Mills guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 21 years.

Louise now has four children, Vinnie, five, Jessica, four, Chiara, two and Luca, 5 months, with her partner Giuseppe. She said it's their love that has helped her move on despite the void Mills has created in their lives.

She said: 'I miss my mum like you wouldn't believe. I miss talking on the phone to her every day. I miss the fact that she's not going to see my children grow up and she's never going to meet her youngest two grandchildren. He doesn't realise how many lives he's ruined because he's killed my mum.' 

She added: 'My kids have helped me get through all of this. If I didn't have them there's no way I could be as strong as I am now.'
