A sea fern has grown in a landlocked area for the first time after its unique marine habitat was created by the amount of salt spread on the roads.

Wildlife experts say the plant - which usually grows by the ocean - has been tricked into thinking the windswept grass verge is a coastal beach front.

The withered plant, 40 miles from the nearest coastline, is thought to be surviving because of the high amounts of salt sprayed on the road over the last two cold winters.

The sea fern was discovered growing alongside the A4 at Thorney Down, north east of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, by local volunteer recorder Anne Appleyard (pictured at site)

It was discovered growing alongside the A4 at Thorney Down, north east of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, by local volunteer recorder Anne Appleyard.

The verge was given 'Protected Road Verge' status 16 years ago because of its unique flora.

Wildlife experts say the plant - which usual grows by the ocean - has been tricked into thinking the windswept grass verge is a coastal beach front

Anne said: 'I was looking mainly at the flora of the banks, including young junipers, but just happened to notice the sea fern-grass right on the edge of the road, where the verge would be affected by salt spray.

'It is one of those normally coastal plants that are spreading inland along the edge of roads treated with de-icing salt.'

Sea fern-grass, also known as Catapodium Marimum, grows in open, sunny brackish soils that are rich in nutrients. 

It
resembles a miniature form of perennial ryegrass and has stems that are
on average 15 cm long with spikelets that are between 4-8 mm long,

Sea fern-grass is rarely found inland but is common on the coasts of England, Wales, Ireland and southern Scotland. 

'I expect that it will be found by other main roads where there are other salt-tolerant plants, but walking along such roads is not very pleasant, which might be why mine is the first record,' added Anne.

She excitedly sent a sample off for analysis, where stunned experts confirmed the find.

Vicki James, data officer for Wiltshire and Swindon Biological Records Centre, said more volunteers were needed to study the spread of the plant.

'Each verge has a volunteer who checks on the condition of the verge and records the wildlife found there,' she said.

'We are always looking for more people to volunteer to record sightings so we hope that Anne's discovery will galvanise more people to come forward and help us record species.

'Who knows what new species we'll find next? Qualifications in botany aren't required and full support will be given to anyone joining the volunteer scheme.

'We don't need people to be experts, just keen to learn.'

It can be spotted by its distinctive red stem among other vegetation and is easiest to find when it blossoms with its small white flowers.

Unlike most species of grass, sea fern-grass only lives for one year.
