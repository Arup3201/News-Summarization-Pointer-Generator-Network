Pauline Harrison a Merseyside PCSO, tripped over a fence on a 999 call and received a £4,000 payout while her lawyers took more than £57,500

Lawyers who won £4,000 compensation for a PCSO who hurt her knee while investigating a burglary also pocketed £57,000 in legal fees, it emerged yesterday.

Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call of a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft wooden fence.

Her ‘no win, no fee’ lawyers, Lucas Law, settled the controversial case out of court in December, but last night it emerged that the Macclesfield-based firm has claimed £57,589 for costs – a staggering 14 times the amount of Mrs Harrison’s payout.

Campaigners last night condemned the fees, which will be paid by insurers of the owners of the former school where Mrs Harrison was injured.

They said the fees were a ‘sad’ reflection of the burgeoning compensation culture in the UK, which is having  a knock-on effect for the general  public in rising insurance premiums.

Dia Chakravarty, the political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is a sad truth of our absurd compensation culture that the only real winners are ambulance-chasing lawyers.’

A source close to the case added: ‘The amount of costs these lawyers have put in for is absolutely outrageous. The British public is paying the price for these ridiculous bills in higher insurance premiums, which are going up and up and up.’

The incident happened in 2009 when the police community support officer, who serves with Merseyside Police, responded to reports of youths on the roof of four-storey Sunshine House, a former school for the blind owned by property development firm Lightflask.

Previously, yobs had lit fires in the grounds, so the firm had secured its perimeter with a 6ft iron fence, except for a small wooden fence closing off a gateway at the front of the site.

Miss Harrison said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport.

In court papers, Miss Harrison said Lightflask was negligent because it had allowed the wooden fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’.

The former dog trainer also said the company had failed to properly warn her about the fencing or erect warning signs.

Her decision to sue was condemned by her own police force when it was revealed in November.

A spokesman for Lightflask said that they could not discuss details of the case because of confidentiality issues, but previously said it was ‘crazy’ that members of the public could be sued by police going about their duties.

‘Risks cannot be removed from every situation,’ the spokesman said. ‘It’s crazy that claims can be made by police officers in their line of work. The nature of their job is risky.

‘Generally speaking, the problem is not necessarily with claimants but with the law firms chasing these cases. Often they are making more than the claimants are receiving in damages.’

Miss Harrison’s solicitor, Jared  Bailey, yesterday declined to comment.

Last year Home Secretary Theresa May criticised ‘frivolous’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘not the sort of attitude’ they should exhibit.

Her comments came after WPC Kelly Jones, 33, threatened to sue a garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, after she tripped over a kerb while investigating a burglary. She later dropped her claim.
