A lorry driver narrowly escaped serious injury when the cement mixer he was driving was swallowed up by a massive sinkhole that appeared in the road.

Adam Zubarev, 47, had been heading to a building site in the city of Voronezh in western Russia's Voronezh Oblast when he suddenly came to an abrupt stop after the ground collapsed underneath him.

He said: 'I was travelling pretty fast when suddenly I felt the truck bump as if it had hit something and come to a stop, which sent me flying forward. I had absolutely no idea what had happened but then it started lifting in the air and suddenly I was looking at the sky. I opened the door and jumped out as quickly as possible and realised that almost the entire lorry had vanished into a hole in the ground.'

The massive cement mixer was swallowed by the sinkhole in Voronezh, western Russia 

Driver Adam Zubarev said he had been driving quite quickly when he suddenly felt a bump 

The truck was filled with quick-drying concrete which hardened as soon as the vehicle's drum stopped turning

What is more, the cement mixer was filled with quick drying cement that because it was no longer turning had started to harden, and by the time rescue workers had arrived with a crane it was impossible to save the load.

He said: 'It was a shame, I reckon the load would have gone some way towards filling the hole although it was pretty big.'

Police spokesman Jaroslav Yefremov said: 'The truck which was a "Kamaz" cement mixer vanished into a hole in the ground at the point with the road runs alongside the river outside the Marksimir shopping centre. The road had only just been repaired so it's a mystery as to how this happened.'

Driver Victor Bayshevfell shot this footage just as the truck vanished into the ground before police and engineers sealed off the street said that it had caused traffic chaos later as vehicles were diverted to allow emergency services to try and pull the badly damaged cement mixer free.

In total it was in the ground for almost two days. Yefremov said: 'We couldn't risk putting up a crane until we had tested the rest of the ground to make sure there weren't any other surprises.' 

The truck was stuck in the hole for two days while engineers tested whether more of the road was at risk

Eventually the truck was removed although engineers are baffled as to why the road had failed
