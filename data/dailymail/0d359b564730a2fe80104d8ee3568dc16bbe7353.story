The award ceremony at Crufts was overshadowed by a protester who ran onto the stage as the winner of Best in Show was presented with the trophy after a competition of seemingly never-ending drama.

As Rebecca Cross and her Scottish terrier Knopa were handed the trophy at the prestigious dog show, the suited man charged in front of the winning pair, holding aloft a sign which read 'Mutts Against Crufts'.

The demonstrator was quickly hauled off stage by four members of security as the shocked crowd watched in astonishment, eventually leaving owner Ms Cross and Knopa to enjoy their victory.

The protest is the second controversy to hit this year's Crufts, with an owner claiming that her prize-winning red setter was poisoned. 

Dee Milligan-Bott said her dog, known by its competing name Thendara Satisfaction, collapsed and died on Friday and she believes the three-year-old must have been poisoned at the competition the day before. 

And just when it seemed the dog show could not get any more dramatic, it emerged that winning owner Ms Cross almost did not make the grand finale after her flight from America was delayed. 

According to Dogs in the News, the proud owner said: 'I can’t believe it, I am in complete shock. I almost didn’t make it, my flight was delayed, and I thought I wouldn’t make it in time.

'Knopa is one in a million. She was Best of Breed here in 2013 and it’s been a really wild ride. It hasn’t sunk in yet, I really can’t believe it. She was supposed to retire today so if so this was her retirement show.'

Ms Cross and Knopa, who was bred the U.S. under Russian owners and competes under the name McVan’s to Russia With Love, had earlier won the terrier group before taking the Best in Show award. 

The Scottish terrier, who is the first of its breed to be crowned top dog since 1929, beat Dublin, a flat coated retriever, into a well-earned second place. Dublin, from Sweden, had earlier won the Gundog group.

Dubbed the 'toy and utility' day, today was the final installment of this year's competition - which has been marked by an array of incredible and outrageous costumes.

Among the competitors at Birmingham's NEC arena were dogs in colourful body suits, ankle warmers and bibs - while one Yorkshire terrier appeared on stage wearing curlers and a nightie.

Crufts is the world's largest dog show with beloved pets competing in categories include agility, heelwork to music and the ever-popular flyball final.

In addition to competitors' shows, the fourth day featured a presentation of the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year Award.

There was also an RAF display and a traditional presentation of a painting to the 2014 Best In Show Winner.

This year's show has also seen been hit by tragedy after a prize-winning  competitor died amid fears that the animal was poisoned.

Owner Dee Milligan-Bott said her dog, known by its competing name Thendara Satisfaction, collapsed on Friday and she believes the three-year-old Irish setter must have been poisoned at Crufts the day before.

Writing on Facebook she said that an autopsy found cubes of beef in Jagger's stomach were apparently found 'stuffed with two to three different poisons.'
