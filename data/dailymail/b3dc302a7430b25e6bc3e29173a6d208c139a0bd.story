A diamond encrusted motorbike designed by Wayne Rooney has sold for £43,000 at a charity auction.

England ace Rooney, 27, was approached by Danish firm Lauge Jensen to work on a ‘chopper’ motorcycle, which sold for £15,000 less than it would normally cost when it was auctioned off today.

The result was a one-off bike emblazoned with the footballer’s iconic celebration after scoring a stunning bicycle kick for Man United against Man City in 2011.

It also has one of his autographed ‘No.10’ football shirts mounted on the petrol tank and lacquer-sealed to preserve it.

Other features include a special shift rod with 22 encrusted diamonds and a front mudguard with WR10 on it.

The bike was one of the star lots at the Bonhams’ sports memorabilia sale in Chester today and was expected to sell for around £60,000.

Despite Rooney's star factor, the hammer went down at £35,000, with fees bringing the total figure up to £43,250.

A Lauge Jensen bike, will typically set back its buyer around £56,000.

All proceeds from the sale are going to KidsAid, a charity which helps children going through traumatic times.

Inspiration: The design of the bike was inspired by Rooney's celebration after scoring an overhead kick against rivals Man City

The bike accelerates from 0-62mph in around four seconds and reaches a top speed of 155mph.

It was initially advertised on eBay last year but the winning bid of £109,700 fell through.

At the time, Rooney said: 'When first approached about the possibility of being involved in the design of a unique "Wayne Rooney" Lauge Jensen custom bike, I was really excited to have the opportunity to be involved.

'The bike we have designed takes its inspiration from the celebration of my overhead kick against Manchester City.

Proceeds: Money from the sale of the bike today are going to KidsAid, a charity which helps children going through traumatic times

Speed: The bike accelerates from 0-62mph in around four seconds and can reach a top speed of 155mph

'The goal has been described by others as being of the highest quality, technical excellence, powerful and beautiful. I hope you will agree that the bike is all of this and more.'

KidsAid spokesman Soren Bach said: 'We are obviously both extremely proud and pleased with Wayne Rooney having agreed to support our work in KidsAid.

'The co-operation will help to bring focus on the children and kids who suffer from illness.'

Former women’s world number one tennis player, Dane Caroline Wozniacki, has also designed a bike for the firm.

The real thing: The celebration which inspired the design of the bike

Iconic: The goal famously helped Manchester United clinch the Premier League title with a 2-1 win over Man City and was voted the Goal of the Season
