Exactly what went on inside the cafe is unclear, but one thing's for sure: the hapless thief wasn't about to go back in after whoever he upset showed him the way out.

In what appears to be a botched burglary on a cafe in Brazil, the thief was thrown out of an upstairs window sideways, before free-falling 10ft onto the hard concrete pavement below.

They say there is honour among thieves, but instead of helping the stricken burglar to his feet, an accomplice on a motorbike races away from the scene leaving his friend to fend for himself.

Dense: This burglar proved Newton's theory of gravity after he was flung through an open window

Botched: The thieves pull up outside the cafe on a motorbike. The passenger jumps off and climbs the steps

Free-fall: Suddenly the burglar comes flying out of an open window. The highest part of his body here was his foot

Despite his bruising experience, the burglar was up on his feet in a flash and - snatching his baseball cap from the pavement, which fell off his head during the fall - flees on foot.

One can only imagine what happened when the burglar, dressed in a t-shirt, shorts and baseball cap, entered the building and disappeared from view.

Perhaps he was expecting the Mercadinho Cafe to be empty leaving him free to steal anything of value.

But it is probably safe to things did not quite go according to plan and this will not go down as the crime of the century.

I'm off: The getaway driver looks around to see his friend lying in a heap. Rather than help him up, he screams away

Wait for me! Stopping to pick up his cap, the hapless burglar flees on foot
