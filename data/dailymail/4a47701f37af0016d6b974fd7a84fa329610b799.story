A TV news anchor has taken the usual step of confirming on Facebook that he’s had plastic surgery after he returned to screens last week look considerably different – and stranger - than how viewers remembered him.

KPRC anchor Bill Balleza has been a familiar face on TV in Houston, Texas, for over 30 years.

In that time he has gone from a fresh-faced young presenter straight out of the marines to a 65-year-old seasoned vet carrying some extra pounds – especially around his jowls.

But when Balleza returned to hosting his nightly news bulletins on KPRC last Thursday, viewers couldn’t help but notice that he had undergone some kind of transformation whereby has flabby lower face now appeared to have significantly reduced.

Houston media blogger Mike McGuff was quick to say what Balleza’s loyal viewers were thinking and his speculation prompted the presenter to post a statement on KPRC’s Facebook page.

‘I want to “fess up” about something, dear Facebook Friends,’ he wrote. ‘For reasons that are entirely personal I decided to do something about my appearance.’

Balleza wrote that in recent years he had noticed his face and neck had started sagging. The situation had been exacerbated over the past 18 months, he said, after he lost 25 pounds which had resulted in him looking increasingly saggy around the lower cheeks and jaw area.

As a result Balleza said he decided to have a lower face lift, but that the swelling following his treatment was taking ‘longer than anticipated to abate’.

Balleza, who had spent the entire month of July on vacation, was adamant that he hadn’t had any other work done.

‘I did not have any work done on my eyes, but the normal swelling that follows a lower face lift did make the area around my eyes puffy, and the swelling is taking longer than anticipated to abate,’ he wrote.

“I could have waited a few more weeks for the swelling to fully resolve but I really wanted to return to the job I love.

‘It is possible that the swelling will be around for a few more weeks and I am hoping that our viewers will indulge me during this period.’

Balleza’s public seem to have appreciated his honest approach. His Facebook message has received over 100 comments – almost overwhelming positive - and more than 350 likes.

The show of support promoted Balleza to posted a message of thanks.

‘I am so heartened by your kind and generous comments, friends! I have to tell you I was very worried about how you would receive this news,’ he wrote.

‘I love you all and always will! Thanks for being my friends. It means more to me than you will ever know.’

San Antonio-born Balleza joined KPRC Local 2 on Aug. 18, 1980. He host bulletins at 5 p.m., 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday through Friday.
