Jamie Starkey gunned down a drugs Mr Big to stop him terrorising his family and who has since been shot dead by a hitman

A vigilante who gunned down a drugs Mr Big to stop him terrorising his family has been shot dead by a hitman after he was freed from jail.

Jamie Starkey was only 16 when he shot and wounded Daniel Gee at point blank range during a 5am New Year's Day stand off outside a pub.

He served three and a half years of a seven year term before being released in September 2011.

At 8pm on Sunday night Starkey, now 
21, was walking to his car outside his home in Fazakerley, Liverpool, 
when an assassin dressed in dark clothing cut him down in a hail of 
bullets.

The hitman ran off across a playing field leaving Starkey to die.

Yesterday, Merseyside Police were set 
to interview 33-year-old Gee in jail where he is serving an 
indeterminate prison term for threatening to kill Starkey in a revenge 
attack.

Police had previously secretly 
recorded a conversation during which Gee said: 'Don't worry the little 
f***** is going ... the only place he is safe is in jail and he won't be
safe there ... it'll be even worse in there ... than he is out. I'll 
slit his f****** throat.'

Chief Supt Jon Ward, of Merseyside 
Police, said: 'This was a cold-blooded, calculated shooting of a 
21-year-old man who had recently been released from prison after 
shooting another male on New Year's Day 2008.

'There is no doubt that this was a targeted shooting and that whoever did this meant to kill Jamie Starkey.

'We believe that some members of the 
criminal fraternity will know who did this and will know what lies 
behind it and I would appeal to them to contact us.

'Jamie Starkey was just 21 years old 
and should have been looking forward to his future, but he chose a path 
which has ultimately lead to his death.

'Merseyside Police is committed to tackling gun crime and taking offenders off the streets and I can reassure local residents that we are doing everything in our power to find those responsible for this shooting.

'Patrols have been increased in the area to provide reassurance and the scene of the shooting has been cordoned off to allow for forensic examinations to take place.

'An extensive and thorough investigation is being carried out by the Force Major Incident Team and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area in the hours prior to the shooting to come forward.'

In 2008 Liverpool Crown Court was told how Starkey, who had learning difficulties, fired at Gee after claiming his family suffered months of violence and threats.

Gee was said to have cruised around in a chauffeur-driven £60,000 Range Rover whilst children he had recruited delivered the drugs on bikes.

Starkey, who was released from prison last September after shooting a man on New Year's Day 2008, was shot several times

Starkey had left his house to go to his car at 8am on Sunday when the assassin executed him

Lawyers for Starkey alleged Gee's gang had thrown bricks at the Starkey family home, rammed his brother's car and repeatedly threatened his relatives.

On one occasion associates of Gee were said to have smashed every window at his home covering Starkey's four-year-old sister in glass.

Then days before the shooting of Gee it is claimed the drug dealer had kidnapped one of Starkey's friends and imprisoned him in a derelict house where he had stoned him.

On New Year's Eve, Starkey had been out celebrating in Everton when he encountered one of Gee's friends who threatened to shoot him. The youngster fled to a derelict property on his road, where a Colt revolver was hidden.

During a 15-minute confrontation outside a pub at 5am the following morning, witnesses heard Gee threatening Starkey's family and goading him. At one point, Gee told him: 'Shoot me now or I'm gonna go and kill your mother.'

Starkey then fired and one of the bullets went into Gee's stomach, pierced his lung, and went straight out of his back. He was taken to hospital but refused treatment.

Four days later Gee was arrested for master-minding a city centre drugs conspiracy and was subsequently jailed for seven and a half years years in June 2008.

Starkey was jailed in October 2008 after he admitted wounding with intent and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.

It emerged following the shooting Gee, who had sent a text message to Starkey offering not to speak to police in exchange for £20,000, was plotting revenge within hours of being injured.

When a policeman went to speak to him about his injuries Gee said: 'I fell over mate' then winked and added: 'But don't worry I'll get the little c***.'

'There is no doubt that this was a targeted shooting and that whoever did this meant to kill Jamie Starkey.'

Then in a call to Starkey's mobile just hours after he returned home from hospital after being shot, Gee is alleged to have said: 'All be ready cos one of yers is getting killed. We are not going there, you stupid little tools, you haven't got a clue... we are going to one your girl's ma's or anything first. You little w******. They are going first.'

Adding: 'We are going to deal with every one of them until we get yous.'

Police who bugged his plush flat to trap him over his drug deals, also recorded phone calls which showed Gee conspiring to buy guns and threatening to kill Starkey.

Officers overheard him plotting revenge against Starkey and referring to a '45' and a Mac 10 machine gun.

In a conversation with his partner Gee was heard saying: 'Don't worry the little f***** is going ... the only place he is safe is in jail and he won't be safe there .... it'll be even worse in there ...than he is out. I'll slit his f****** throat.'

The next day he is alleged to have said: 'Put me in for 12 guns ... I'll buy the lot of them.'

And in further conversations he went on: 'We're going lad, we're going big time ... right through the front door, right through the back door and bring this family down, kids whatever... all right lad, see you soon lad.'

In 2010 Gee was found guilty of two counts of threats to kill and another two of blackmail and was told to serve a minimum of four and a half years concurrently to the term he is serving for drug dealing.

At the time Judge Henry Globe QC told: 'I am in no doubt that the public must be protected from you in the future. I really do not know when it will be safe to release you.'
