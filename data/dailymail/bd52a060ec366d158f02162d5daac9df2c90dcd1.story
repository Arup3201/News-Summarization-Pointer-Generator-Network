As America digested the results of the U.S. midterm elections yesterday, one person on Capitol Hill seemed to be more interested in ice hockey than politics.

It has been revealed that somewhere in Congress a person was editing NHL legend Wayne Gretzky's Wikipedia page - changing his height from 5 feet 10 inches  to 6 feet.

Twitter account @CongressEdits, which tracks anonymous Wikipedia edits made from Congressional IP addresses noted the change and posted in on social media.

Incidentally, it appears that whoever made the edit did actually change the page to reflect Gretzky's correct height, which NHL also puts at 6 feet.

And this isn't the first time someone in congress has been caught making Wikipedia edits. 

Earlier this year, Wikipedia put a ten-day total ban on edits made from computers within Congress after humorous changes were made to notable people's profiles, and other edits promoted conspiracy theories. 

Changes to the page of Lee Harvey Oswald claimed that he assassinated President John F Kennedy 'on behalf of the regime of Fidel Castro' and former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfled is described as a 'lizard alien'.

A representative from the Capitol building said that the ban was caused by the actions of 'two or three' and was drawn to attention by @congressedits.

The changes were brought to the attention of Wikipedia administrators when an edit was made from a House IP address for the website Mediaite, calling the media blog 'sexist' and 'transphobic' and alleging that it 'automatically assumes that someone is male without any evidence.'

The website had written a story beforehand about the false edits coming from computers in the Capitol building.

Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, told the BBC at the time that he was far from shocked by the edits and that it has 'always gone and it always will'.

However, he did say that the Twitter feed may have been responsible in part for some of the more outrageous edits. 

It turns out ice hockey star Wayne Gretsky is 6 feet tall, and not 5 feet 10 inches as Wikipedia previously stated

'There is a belief from some of the Wikipedia community that it only provoked someone - some prankster there in the office - to have an audience now for the pranks, and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them.'

He added to the BBC: 'Maybe someone at the House of Representatives better think about their IT staff - they might be hunting them down this very moment.'

It emerged that Wikipedia has been warning users from Congress since March 2012. Wikipedia can be edited by an user any time and anonymously, but the changes are monitored by the website's volunteers, known as Wikipedians. They reverse rogue editing and sometimes ban users who continually change entries.
