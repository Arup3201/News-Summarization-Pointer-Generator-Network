England's players will be ordered to hit the Boks with a backlash at Twickenham on Saturday - to avoid a fifth consecutive Test defeat and end eight years of suffering against the world's No 2-ranked side.

Stuart Lancaster's men go into Saturday's QBE series encounter on the back of four straight losses to New Zealand — knowing there is 'no hiding place' if they fall short again.

Amid all the talk of the Springboks being in wounded-beast mode after their defeat in Ireland last Saturday, the hosts, including Danny Care winning his 50th cap, are ready to unleash frustrations of their own.

'Of course there's going to be a backlash after the fourth defeat,' said forwards coach Graham Rowntree on Friday. 'That is being said in our camp.

'The guys are beating themselves up about it; we're beating ourselves up about it. That was at the start of the week. But you get out on the training field, start sorting things out and move forward.'

The quality of the opposition will not serve as an excuse for English failure. Rowntree added: 'We've simply got to beat these teams, at Twickenham Twickenham. We keep coming close. They (South Africa) are the next big southern-hemisphere team to come to our stadium; we've got to beat them, we know that. And we'll go in all guns blazing to do that.

'The fact that we've not beaten them for X amount of years is almost irrelevant. We've just got to win this next game. There is an expectation on us, there certainly is within.

'We are desperate to win. You can't hide the fact that we lost the last four games. There's no hiding place; we had some very frank discussions but you've quickly got to move on.'

England scrum-half Danny Care will win his 50th cap at Twickenham on Saturday and the 27-year-old acknowledged that team development must soon give way to tangible success.

'I still think we are learning, but it will come to a time when the learning needs to stop and we need to get results,' he said. 'We have shown in patches just how good we are, but we need to turn that into 80-minute performances. The belief is there. We've got it, and we need to put it on the park.'

None of the home players have experienced a Test victory over South Africa, but visiting captain Jean de Villiers is wary of taking too much confidence from that.

'A big part of our group never experienced beating the All Blacks and we managed to do that earlier this year,' the Boks skipper said.

'It's the old thing about records; they're there to be broken. We certainly don't want them to.'

But England are still wary of the South African threat after losing to the All Blacks and forwards coach Rowntree said: 'It will be a huge challenge, but we need this challenge after last week.'
